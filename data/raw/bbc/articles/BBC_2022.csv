The World Health Organization (WHO) chief says he is optimistic that the coronavirus pandemic will be defeated in 2022, provided countries work together to contain its spread.
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu warned against ""narrow nationalism and vaccine hoarding"" in a new year statement.
His comments come two years since the WHO was first notified of cases of an unknown pneumonia strain in China.
Global Covid cases now stand at 287m, while nearly 5.5m people have died. 
Across the world people are marking the new year but celebrations are muted, with many countries wanting to discourage crowds gathering.
Coronavirus remains part of daily life: a disease that has shut borders, split families and in some places made it unthinkable to leave the house without carrying a mask.
Despite all this, Dr Tedros sounded a positive note in his speech, noting that there are now many more tools to treat Covid-19.
But he warned that continuing inequity in vaccine distribution was increasing the risk of the virus evolving.
""Narrow nationalism and vaccine hoarding by some countries have undermined equity and created the ideal conditions for the emergence of the Omicron variant, and the longer inequity continues, the higher the risks of the virus evolving in ways we can't prevent or predict,"" he said. 
""If we end inequity, we end the pandemic,"" he added. 
In other developments:
In his comments, Dr Tedros also alluded to low vaccination rates.
While most of the population in Europe and the Americas have received at least one dose, a WHO target of full vaccination rates in 40% of every country by the end of 2021 has been missed across most of Africa. 
Dr Tedros has previously criticised wealthier nations for ""gobbling up"" the global vaccine supply, fully vaccinating much of their populations while others wait for their first doses. 
The WHO has set a new goal for 2022: vaccinate 70% of people in all countries by July to end the pandemic.

8;Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world?;['2021-12-23T11:38:44.000Z'];['By The Visual and Data Journalism Team'];['coronavirus vaccines', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['workers', 'world', 'vaccinated', 'used', 'progress', 'fast', 'vaccine', 'young', 'groups', 'vulnerable', 'wider', 'younger', 'covid', 'uk', 'vaccines'];"
Almost nine billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 197 countries worldwide. 
However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world.  
Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of their population - but others are some way behind.
With an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. 
Overall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with more than 2.7 billion and 1.4 billion respectively. The US ranks third, with about 500 million.
While some countries in Asia and the Americas are progressing well with their vaccination campaigns, many states in Africa have experienced some supply issues.
The World Health Organization Europe head (WHO) Hans Kluge has warned that Europe is once again ""at the epicentre"" of the Covid pandemic and blames the rise on insufficient vaccine take-up and the relaxation of public health and social measures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is pushing for 40% of the population of all countries to be vaccinated by the end of the year and more than 70% by mid-2022.
Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine.
Covax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year, but it has now downgraded its supply forecast by 25% to 1.4 billion - the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.
So far the scheme has distributed more than 800 million vaccines.
Leaders of the G7 countries have pledged to supply one billion vaccine doses to poorer countries, either directly or through the Covax scheme.
The vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first approved by the WHO, followed by several others.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. 
Unlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge, which makes it easier to distribute.
The African Union has started the distribution of 400 million vaccines produced by Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) - which, unlike the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines, only requires one dose.
Most governments have started with doses for the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. After priority groups have been vaccinated, there is a wider rollout among younger age groups. The Pfizer vaccine has been approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in the US, UK, Europe and other countries. The Sinovac vaccine is being used for children as young as three in China and Colombia.
In countries such as Israel and the UK, there are already promising signs the vaccines are reducing hospital admissions and deaths. They are also among some countries offering booster shots at least six months after a second dose.
Early studies suggest the newly identified Omicron variant of coronavirus is better able to evade vaccine protection than previous strains, though vaccination still offers strong protection against serious illness and hospitalisation. 
A third 'booster' dose of a vaccine does appear to offer protection against infection from Omicron and at least 82 countries have begun booster vaccination programmes.
Worldwide, more than 100 possible vaccines are undergoing trials to test their efficacy and safety. 
Our World in Data, a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity, collated the information in the map and table above.

9;Covid map: Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country;['2021-12-30T15:53:02.000Z'];['By The Visual and Data Journalism Team'];['shielding', 'public health', 'china', 'social distancing', 'self-isolation', 'united states', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['cases', 'revisions', 'average', 'updated', 'university', 'reflect', 'regularly', 'coronavirus', 'vaccinations', 'update', 'deaths', 'country', 'map', 'covid', 'rolling', 'totals'];"
Covid-19 is continuing to spread around the world, with nearly 300 million confirmed cases and more than five million deaths across almost 200 countries. 
During the Christmas and new year holiday period the publication of Covid data in lots of countries will be intermittent. It is likely that a full picture will only be available again in early January.
The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by the UK, Russia and France. 
Very few places have been left untouched. 
In the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 10,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.
The true extent of the first outbreak in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available.
Deaths are rising in some areas, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. 
Data on excess deaths, a measure of how many more people are dying than would be expected based on the previous few years, may give a better indication of the actual numbers in many cases. 
Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 87 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. 
The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.
According to that data, more than 50% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is less than 10%. 
Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. 
Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, the UK and Bahrain have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. 
The number of daily cases has begun to rise again in most regions now, due in part to the new Omicron variant.  
Studies suggest that Omicron - which has quickly become dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the combination of the two variants is causing a ""tsunami"" of new infections. 
Asia
Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, has seen cases falling in recent weeks.
But there are fears that a sharp rise in daily cases in India could be a sign that a third wave will hit in the country in the coming weeks. 
The official death toll in India is 480,000 and it has recorded about 35 million cases - second only to the US.
Europe
Several European countries have increased the scale of their vaccine and booster campaigns after seeing a spike in infections due to the Omicron variant.
The UK is currently seeing more daily cases than anywhere else in Europe but hospitalisations and deaths have been greatly reduced due to its vaccination rollout.
France, Spain and Italy are also experiencing a rapid increase in infections at the moment. 
North America
The US has recorded more than 50 million cases and over 820,000 deaths - the highest figures in the world - and it is now seeing a renewed surge in infections. 
Dr Anthony Fauci, the country's chief adviser on infectious disease, has warned that the new wave could have a serious impact on health services across the country.
The death rate in Canada is far lower than its neighbour's but it is also seeing a rise in the number of daily cases at the moment due to the Omicron variant.
Latin America
In Latin America, the number of new cases in the worst-hit countries had been falling recently, but cases appear to be on the rise again in some places.
Argentina, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru are among the countries seeing an uptick in infections at the moment.
The regional office of the WHO has warned that rising infections coupled with increased social interaction over the holiday period ""may lead to a rise in cases, hospitalisations, and deaths in the coming weeks"".
Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region, recording more than 22 million cases and about 620,000 deaths - the world's second highest official death toll. 
In Peru, there have been more than 200,000 deaths and the country has the highest number of deaths by population size - more than 600 deaths for every 100,000 people.
Africa
Africa has seen nearly 10 million cases and more than 225,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.
According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than three million confirmed cases and nearly 100,000 deaths. 
South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - although the rise in deaths has not been as dramatic. 
Several African nations are currently experiencing a rise in cases, including Ethiopia, Zambia, Kenya and Ghana. 
Middle East
Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began. 
The official death toll in Iran, the Middle East's worst-hit country, is more than 130,000 and it has seen more than six million confirmed cases. Neighbouring Iraq has seen nearly 25,000 deaths and more than two million confirmed cases. Daily infections, however, are currently falling in both countries.
Israel currently has the highest number of daily cases in the region but its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. 
Oceania
Australia is currently seeing its highest level of Covid cases since the pandemic began because of the Omicron variant. 
The country was due to further ease restrictions in place to deal with the previous wave of infections in October, but some of that easing has now been put on hold. 
Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid, but the latter has proved more adept at dealing with the virus recently thanks to lockdowns and tight border controls. 
Australia has seen 360,000 confirmed cases in total and more than 2,200 deaths, while there have been 14,000 cases in New Zealand and only 51 deaths. 
Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020. 
It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.
A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. 
The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.
When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.
Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.
The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands.

10;Covid-19 vaccinations: African nations miss WHO target;['2021-12-31T01:49:21.000Z'];['By Peter Mwai'];['coronavirus vaccines', 'reality check', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['miss', 'covid19', 'workers', 'nations', 'african', 'relatively', 'vaccine', 'role', 'scepticism', 'quantify', 'vaccinations', 'rates', 'target', 'vaccination', 'playing', 'hesitancy'];"
A target for achieving full vaccination rates of 40% in every country by the end of December has been missed across most of Africa.
The World Health Organization (WHO) put forward the goal earlier this year, but only about 9% of people on the continent have been fully vaccinated against Covid so far.
These low rates of vaccination have been of particular concern following the identification of the Omicron variant in South Africa, and its rapid global spread in recent weeks. 
Just seven countries on the continent have reached the 40% target.
Three of these are small island nations where the logistical challenges are much easier to overcome. Seychelles and Mauritius have fully vaccinated more than 70% of their populations, Cape Verde around 45%.
Of the countries on the mainland of Africa, only Morocco, Tunisia, Botswana and Rwanda have exceeded the target.
Countries in the south of the continent are doing considerably better than elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.
As of 30 December, just under half of the countries on the continent had achieved more than 10% of the population fully vaccinated (a target the WHO had set for the end of September, and which was missed by most African nations).
Many countries, including some of the continent's largest, have so far vaccinated fewer than 5% of their populations.
The only country on the continent not to have begun a vaccination programme is Eritrea.
The WHO has set a further target of 70% coverage for all countries by June 2022, but this could also be missed across Africa. ""As things stand, predictions are that Africa may not reach the 70% vaccination coverage target until August 2024,"" WHO Africa regional director Matshidiso Moeti says.
Poor health infrastructure, a lack of funding for training and deploying medical staff, as well as vaccine storage issues have all played a part.
This has become more of an issue because although global supply has improved, distribution and administration of vaccines in some parts of the world are lagging behind.
The WHO and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have expressed concern that some donated vaccines have been delivered with little notice and with short shelf lives.
They want vaccines to have a minimum of two and a half months of shelf life on arrival, and for countries to be made aware a month before delivery.
There are also fears that vaccine hesitancy and scepticism could be playing a role, although it can be hard to quantify the impact. In November, the WHO highlighted relatively low rates of vaccination among Africa's health workers, which it said was likely to be in part because of vaccine hesitancy as well as availability and access.
African states have relied on a combination of bilateral deals and donations, as well as the global Covax vaccine-sharing scheme, which is intended to help poorer countries get vaccines.
Many countries early this year struggled to get supplies, although the situation has improved markedly over the past few months. Wealthier countries announced donations via Covax - or directly to African nations - at the G7 summit in the UK in June.
The problems faced are now more to do with the logistics of delivery within country, rather than the supply of the vaccines themselves.
""With supplies starting to increase, we now must intensify our focus on other barriers to vaccination. They include lack of funding, equipment, healthcare workers and cold chain capacity along with tackling vaccine hesitancy,"" says Matshidiso Moeti.
Of the vaccines supplied so far to Africa, 63% have been administered. However, around half of the countries have used up fewer than 50% of doses received, according to the latest WHO data.
The biggest problem facing the Covax scheme - which many African states were relying on - was its dependence on vaccines from the Serum Institute of Indi (SII) a, the world's biggest vaccine-maker. 
India halted vaccine exports in April in response to its own urgent needs, and other manufacturers faced issues ramping up production. 
These supply issues from India appear to be less of an issue now, with the SII announcing in early December that it was cutting back production because of a decline in new orders for its vaccines.
Wealthier countries had also signed deals with manufacturers for prospective vaccines as early as July 2020, while they were still in development and undergoing trials. 
They were given priority by manufacturers - making it difficult for the Covax scheme, the African Union and individual countries to secure doses. In September, a Covax statement said it was reducing its estimate of the number of doses it expects to receive for the rest of this year and into 2022.
An update in December said that although Covax supply had increased, there was still uncertainty over the numbers of doses it might get.
The WHO says Africa needs more than 900m vaccine doses to fully vaccinate 40% of its population.
As of 30 December, the continent had received just over 474m doses in total - from the Covax initiative as well as the Africa Union vaccine acquisition scheme, and through bilateral deals.

11;Virginia Giuffre: Prince Andrew accuser seeks evidence he could not sweat;['2021-12-31T23:54:13.000Z'];['BBC News'];['prince andrew, duke of york', 'ghislaine maxwell', 'jeffrey epstein'];['seeks', 'reasonably', 'lawyers', 'sweat', 'information', 'prince', 'objected', 'lead', 'irrelevant', 'giuffre', 'accuser', 'andrew', 'evidence', 'private', 'request', 'virginia'];"
Lawyers for a US woman who has accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault are seeking proof of the British royal's alleged inability to sweat. 
Virginia Giuffre's legal team made the request as part of a civil case against the prince in a New York court.
Ms Giuffre, 38, alleges that Prince Andrew sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager at the homes of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.
Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations.
In a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, he said a ""problem"" with her account was that a medical condition at the time meant he could not have been sweating, as she claims he was. 
This video can not be played
A civil case filed in the US alleges that the prince sexually abused Ms Giuffre - then known as Virginia Roberts - at Maxwell's London home, and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little St James in the Virgin Islands.
Epstein, a convicted sex offender, killed himself in prison in 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial. British socialite Maxwell was found guilty this week of grooming underage girls to be abused by him.
The motion filed by Ms Giuffre's lawyers calls on Prince Andrew to supply ""all documents concerning your alleged medical condition of anhidrosis, hypohidrosis, or your inability to sweat"".
Prince Andrew's lawyers said he objected to the request ""on the grounds that it is harassing and seeks confidential and private information and documents that are irrelevant, immaterial and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence"". 
They added that Prince Andrew had no such documents in his possession to hand over. 
The motion also includes requests for details of Prince Andrew's trips on Epstein's planes, and communication he had with Epstein and Maxwell.
In a separate development, a request by Prince Andrew's lawyers to pause the proceedings against him has been turned down by a US judge. 
His lawyers had wanted Ms Giuffre to take part in a two-hour deposition to discuss her country of residence. 
Ms Giuffre has been living in Western Australia and Prince Andrew's lawyers had argued that this may disqualify her from filing a lawsuit in a US court. The judge rejected the demand.
Meanwhile Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty on Wednesday of recruiting and trafficking young girls for Epstein, awaits sentencing, a date for which has not yet been set. The verdict could see her spend the rest of her life behind bars.
The jury's decision was welcomed by the survivors, with Annie Farmer - the only witness to use her real name during testimony - saying she was ""so relieved and grateful"". 
Ms Giuffre, who was not one of the four women who testified in the case but was referenced on many occasions in court, said she would ""remember this day always"".
Maxwell's brother Ian told the BBC that she would appeal against the verdict ""on legal grounds - both in terms of the pre-trial process and the trial process as well"", but did not give further details.
He described the victims' testimony as ""heart-rending"" but said he still believed his sister's innocence. 
Another of Epstein and Maxwell's accusers, Sarah Ransome, criticised Mr Maxwell's remarks.
""This sex trafficking pyramid wouldn't exist without Ghislaine,"" she told the BBC.
""I really think Ghislaine's brother should sit in a room full of Ghislaine's survivors because then he might have a different opinion of what his sister actually has done. She has destroyed hundreds of lives.""

Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and nearly 1,000 homes have been destroyed as wildfires spread through the US state of Colorado.
The fast-moving blazes are burning in Boulder County, north of Denver. Governor Jared Polis called it a ""New Year's Eve miracle"" that no deaths had been reported.
Some 30,000 people in the towns of Louisville and Superior were told to leave their homes on Thursday.
A state of emergency has been declared.
""It was in blink of an eye. This was a disaster in fast motion, all in the course of half a day,"" Governor Polis said in a news conference on Friday.
""Nearly 1,000 homes are gone,"" he added.
Winds of up to 105 mph (169 km/h) are fanning flames across the region amid a historic drought.
While previous fires in Colorado have been in rural areas, these latest blazes are burning in more suburban parts of the state. Thursday's fires, named the Marshall Fire and Middle Fork Fire, are coming relatively late in the season. 
At least some were sparked when power lines were toppled by strong winds, and they have quickly become the most destructive wildfires in the state's modern history. Experts say that wildfires in western North America have grown more intense in recent years. 
""This is our community so to watch it burn so quickly, so unexpectedly, is something that we are struggling to understand,"" said Gov Polis, who added that President Joe Biden had called to say he would sign a federal emergency declaration.
Some 370 homes went up in flames west of Superior and 210 were lost in the Old Town area of Superior, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said.
A shopping complex and hotel were also destroyed, and about 6,000 acres were burned in total, the sheriff said. 
Snow had began falling near the fires on Friday morning, offering some reprieve to firefighters who say the remaining fires are expected to burn out shortly.
Neither of the two major hospitals in the area were affected, and all schools were ""spared"" from the flames, added Gov Polis. 
At least one first responder and six others were injured, Sheriff Pelle said, adding that more casualties were likely. 
One video taken outside a supermarket showed a dramatic scene as winds ripped through the car park.
Patrick Kilbride, 72, was at work in a hardware store when he heard the order to evacuate, The Denver Post reported. 
He rushed home but only had time to gather a few possessions before the flames engulfed the property. His pet dog and cat both died. 
""It's just a strange feeling to go from having everything to make your life comfortable to having nothing,"" he said.
Colorado has been experiencing extreme droughts in recent years. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

13;Rogel Aguilera-Mederos: Colorado truck driver's sentence cut by 100 years;['2021-12-31T14:17:29.000Z'];['BBC News'];['colorado', 'united states', 'kim kardashian'];['100', 'rest', 'countless', 'rogel', 'loss', 'cut', 'life', 'forget', 'colorado', 'sentence', 'drivers', 'aguileramederos', 'struggle', 'truck', 'event', 'ones', 'loved', 'injuries'];"
A truck driver who was facing a 110-year jail term for a deadly crash has had his sentence reduced to 10 years, following widespread outcry.
Rogel Aguilera-Mederos' lorry crashed into traffic in 2019, killing four people in the US state of Colorado.
At trial he was convicted on 27 counts, and the judge said state law forced him to impose the lengthy sentence.
But on Thursday, Colorado Governor Jared Polis commuted what he called an ""unjust"" sentence.
Aguilera-Mederos was transporting timber in the Rocky Mountains foothills when the deadly crash happened in April 2019.
The lorry careered downhill into stationary traffic, bursting into flames and causing a major pile up in the city of Lakewood.
Four people - Stanley Politano, 69, William Bailey, 67, Doyle Harrison, 61, and Miguel Angel Lamas Arellano, 24 - were killed.
Aguilera-Mederos, a Cuban immigrant, told officials that his brakes had failed, and that he had tried his best to avoid other vehicles as he lost control of the truck.
But prosecutors argued that the 26-year-old knew his brakes were failing. 
They said he dangerously weaved between vehicles, and that he drove past at least one runaway truck ramp - long lanes at the side of roads designed for vehicles with brake problems to drive into and stop safely.
Judge Bruce Jones told the court that - under Colorado law - he had to impose the mandatory minimum sentence for all of convictions, and that they must be served consecutively.
""If I had the discretion, it would not be my sentence,"" the judge said after Aguilera-Mederos was convicted.
More than five million people, including reality TV star and law student Kim Kardashian West, signed a petition that called for a reduction in his lengthy prison sentence.
Truck drivers also announced on social media that they would boycott Colorado over the sentencing.
As governor, Mr Polis has constitutional power to grant pardons, clemency and commutations.
In a letter to Aguilera-Mederos, he called the crash ""a tragic but unintentional act"" and said there was ""an urgency to remedy this unjust sentence and restore confidence in the uniformity and fairness of our criminal justice system"".
""You will struggle with this burden of this event for the rest of your life, but never forget that... countless others will struggle with the loss of their loved ones or injuries as well,"" he added.
Aguilera-Mederos will be eligible to apply for parole in five years.
The timing of the governor's move has not been welcomed by everyone. 
In a statement, District Attorney Alexis King said she was ""disappointed in the Governor's decision to act prematurely"".
A hearing to reconsider the verdict had already been planned, and Ms King had previously said she would ask for Aguilera-Mederos to be resentenced to up to 30 years in prison.
""I joined the surviving victims and families of those who lost their loved ones in their wish to have the trial judge determine an appropriate sentence in this case,"" said Ms King.

Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, and Dr June Raine, head of the vaccines regulator MHRA, are both made dames.
And Tony Blair is knighted, being appointed to the Order of the Garter.
Unlike the main New Year Honours list, which is advised on by the prime minister's office, the Order of the Garter is a royal appointment.
The former prime minister said it was ""an immense honour"" and he was ""deeply grateful to Her Majesty the Queen"".
On the main list, actresses Joanna Lumley and Vanessa Redgrave are made dames.
In sport, husband and wife Jason and Laura Kenny are made a knight and a dame for services to cycling, while Jody Cundy - who has won multiple Paralympic golds in swimming and cycling - is appointed CBE.
Tom Daley, who won Olympic gold in Tokyo in the summer, is appointed OBE for services to ""diving, LGBTQ+ rights and charity"". His diving partner and fellow gold medallist, Matty Lee, gets an MBE.
Swimmer Adam Peaty and gymnast Max Whitlock also become OBEs, while shock US Open winner Emma Raducanu is appointed MBE.
Journalist Trevor Phillips is knighted for services to equality and human rights while ""Money Saving Expert"" Martin Lewis is appointed CBE for services to broadcasting and consumer rights.
June Brown - the 94-year-old actress who played Dot Cotton in EastEnders - is appointed OBE, as is Coronation Street actor Bill Roache, who plays Ken Barlow.
Katie Piper is appointed OBE for her work with burns victims; Kate Garraway is made an MBE for services to broadcasting, journalism, and charity; and Spice Girl Melanie Brown is appointed MBE for her work with vulnerable women.
The two highest honours go to the former Labour MP for Birkenhead, Lord Field, and Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse. They become Companions of Honour, where membership is limited to 65 people.
Actor Daniel Craig is made a companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, for services to film and theatre. It is generally awarded for work in a foreign country - James Bond, who Craig plays in the film franchise, was fictionally given the same honour.
Meanwhile, 12-year-old Max Woosey - who has slept in a tent for more than 600 nights in a row to raise £700,000 (and counting) for North Devon Hospice - is awarded a British Empire Medal. 
And Tobias Weller - an 11-year-old with cerebral palsy and autism - is also given a BEM for his charity fundraising. Although children have won BEMs before, Tobias is thought to be the youngest ever recipient.
The oldest person on this year's list is 102-year-old magician Henry Lewis from London, appointed MBE for his work with the Magic Circle.
In total, more than 1,200 people are on the main UK New Year Honours list, which ranges from the Companion of Honour and the Order of the Bath, through knighthoods and damehoods, to CBEs, OBEs, MBEs, and the BEM - read more about the system here.
In total, 15.1% of recipients are from an ethnic minority background, which the government said made it ""for the fourth time running, the most ethnically diverse honours list to date"". In total, 47.9% of recipients are women.

Prof Whitty - now Sir Chris - is the chief medical officer for England and the UK government's chief medical adviser. He has appeared at Downing Street news conferences since March 2020, as well as fronting TV campaigns about Covid-19.
He is also a practising NHS consultant at London hospitals, and represents the UK on the executive board of the World Health Organization.
Prof Van-Tam has been the deputy chief medical officer for England since 2017, and has captured the public's imagination with his vivid metaphors at news conferences.
In late 2020 - while describing the early stages of the pandemic - he said ""it's clear the away team gave us an absolute battering"".
A year later, in November 2021, he warned ""the final whistle hasn't blown"" in the pandemic, but did predict we were in ""half time of extra time"".
""I love metaphors,"" he told the BBC in 2020. ""I think they bring complex stories to life for people.""
The government's chief scientific adviser Prof Sir Patrick Vallance - who was knighted in the 2019 New Year Honours - is given a higher honour, being made a knight commander of the Order of the Bath.
That's the same rank as Prof Whitty, who was previously a commander of the Order of the Bath. Prof Van-Tam is a regular ""knight bachelor"" - but he, Prof Vallance, and Prof Whitty, will all have the title ""Sir"".
The chief medical officer for Wales, Dr Frank Atherton, is made a knight, as is Prof Gregor Smith, the chief medical officer for Scotland. Emily Lawson, who has led England's vaccination deployment, becomes a dame.

15;French ban on plastic packaging for fruit and vegetables begins;['2021-12-31T22:50:54.000Z'];['BBC News'];['france', 'plastic pollution', 'emmanuel macron', 'environment'];['begins', 'throwaway', 'statement', 'french', 'uses', 'reusable', 'plastics', 'single', 'ban', 'recyclable', 'plastic', 'packaging', 'fruit', 'vegetables', 'substitution'];"
A new law banning plastic packaging on most fruit and vegetables comes into effect in France from New Year's day.
Cucumbers, lemons and oranges are among the 30 varieties banned from being wrapped in plastic.
Larger packs as well as chopped or processed fruit will be exempt.
President Emmanuel Macron called the ban ""a real revolution"" and said it showed the country's commitment to phase out single use plastics by 2040. 
More than a third of fruit and vegetable products in France are thought to be sold in plastic wrapping, and government officials believe that the ban could prevent a billion items of single use plastics being used every year. 
In an statement announcing the new law, the Environment Ministry said that France uses an ""outrageous amount"" of single use plastics and that the new ban ""aims at cutting back the use of throwaway plastic and boost its substitution by other materials or reusable and recyclable packaging"". 
The ban forms part of a multi-year programme introduced by Mr Macron's government that will see plastics slowly eased out in many industries. 
From 2021, the country banned plastic straws, cups and cutlery, as well as polystyrene takeaway boxes. 
And later in 2022 public spaces will be forced to provide water fountains to reduce the use of plastic bottles, publications will have to be shipped without plastic wrapping, and fast-food restaurants will no longer be able offer free plastic toys.
However, industry figures have expressed concerns over the speed at which the new ban is being introduced. 
Philippe Binard, from the European Fresh Produce Association, said the ""removal of plastic packaging from most fruit and vegetables at such short notice does not allow alternatives to be tested and introduced in a timely manner and stocks of existing packaging to be cleared"". 
Several other European countries have announced similar bans in recent months as they pursue commitments made at the recent COP26 conference in Glasgow. 
Earlier this month Spain announced that it will introduce a ban on the sale of fruit and vegetables in plastic packaging from 2023 to allow business to find alternative solutions.
Mr Macron's government also announced several other new environmental regulations, including rules calling on car adverts to promote greener alternatives such as walking and cycling.

16;Desmond Tutu: Body of South African hero to be aquamated;['2021-12-31T18:55:11.000Z'];['BBC News'];['desmond tutu', 'south africa'];['hero', 'legacy', 'ip', 'african', 'desmond', 'body', 'spending', 'given', 'south', 'aquamated', 'lavish', 'leah', 'insisted', 'tutu', 'ostentatiousness', 'trust'];"
The late anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu is to be aquamated - a process using water that is described as an environmentally friendly alternative to cremation.
It was ""what he aspired to as an eco-warrior,"" said Very Rev Michael Weeder.
Thousands of South Africans have been paying their last respects at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town where Tutu's body has been lying in state.
There has been an outpouring of emotion since his death a week ago aged 90.
One man, Wally Mdluli, hitchhiked more than 1,000km (620 miles) from Bloemfontein to Cape Town - enlisting the help of family and friends to pay for some of the trip and even sleeping at a petrol station on the way.
""I feel fulfilled after I saw the coffin. It's like his spirit is in me,"" he told the BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Cape Town.
""It's a memory [I will have] for the rest of my life,"" Mr Mdluli added, saying he hoped that he and all South Africans would live according to Tutu's values.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu's burial is expected to take place this weekend. It is not yet known whether his family will opt for a private or public ceremony.
He had insisted there should be ""no ostentatiousness or lavish spending"" on the ceremony and that he be given ""the cheapest available coffin"", with the only flowers in the cathedral to be ""a bouquet of carnations from his family"", according to the Archbishop Tutu IP Trust and the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation.
His ashes are to be interred behind the pulpit at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town - the Anglican diocese he served as Archbishop for 35 years.

Aquamation, which uses water, is touted as a greener alternative to cremation, which uses fire. Practitioners say it cuts the amount of environmentally harmful carbon dioxide produced by up to 90%.
The technical name for the process is alkaline hydrolysis - and it involves weighing the body, then heating it to 150C (300F) in a mixture of potassium hydroxide and water for up to 90 minutes.
This dissolves the body tissue, leaving only the bones - which are then rinsed at 120C, dried, and pulverised into a coarse powder using a machine called a cremulator.
Once all these steps are complete, the remains can be buried or scattered in accordance with the deceased's wishes - just as would happen in an ordinary cremation.

17;Jeffrey Epstein: Charges dropped against prison guards who falsified records;['2021-12-31T16:08:15.000Z'];['BBC News'];['prince andrew, duke of york', 'jeffrey epstein death', 'new york city', 'ghislaine maxwell', 'jeffrey epstein', 'united states'];['dropped', 'temporarily', 'metropolitan', 'guards', 'manhattan', 'deteriorating', 'charges', 'earlier', 'lower', 'epstein', 'jeffrey', 'secure', 'falsified', 'records', 'correctional', 'prison', 'facilities'];"
US prosecutors have dismissed charges against two prison guards who falsified records the night Jeffrey Epstein killed himself on their watch.
Tova Noel and Michael Thomas admitted to fabricating log entries to show they had monitored Epstein properly.
Prosecutors have asked a judge to dismiss their case, saying the pair have complied with a plea deal.
A convicted sex offender, Epstein was found dead in his jail cell on the morning of 10 August 2019.
The American financier had been awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges, and had pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing dozens of girls, some as young as 14.
On the night he committed suicide, Epstein was alone in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center New York, authorities said at the time.
He had been taken off suicide watch after a previous suspected attempt to take his own life.
Surveillance footage showed that no other people had entered the area where Epstein was held that evening, officials said.
In May, Ms Noel and Mr Thomas admitted they had not conducted their required half-hourly checks on Epstein.
Instead they spent substantial portions of their shifts at their desk, browsed the internet, and moved around the common area, just 15ft (4.5m) from Epstein's cell.
One of the guards was working a second mandatory eight-hour shift of the day, while the other was on a fifth consecutive day of overtime.
As part of a plea deal, the pair agreed to complete 100 hours of community service and co-operate with an investigation by the justice department's inspector general.
On 13 December, federal prosecutors filed a ""nolle prosequi"" - a legal document that declares they no longer wished to pursue the case - and said Ms Noel and Mr Thomas had satisfactorily complied with the agreement.
But the request did not appear in public records until Thursday - a day after Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty of recruiting and trafficking young girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.
It is unclear why the document was not filed until 30 December.
The Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan is one of the most secure prison facilities in the US. But earlier this year, authorities announced that it would be temporarily closed due to deteriorating conditions.
About six miles away (9km) in Brooklyn, Maxwell is awaiting sentencing in another facility. She faces up to 65 years in prison, and still has a separate trial for perjury to come.
Meanwhile Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, is facing a civil case from Virginia Giuffre, who has accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager at the homes of Epstein and Maxwell.
Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations.

18;Covid booster 88% effective against hospital treatment with Omicron;['2021-12-31T16:27:18.000Z'];['By Philippa Roxby and Jim Reed'];['coronavirus vaccines', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['expected', 'omicron', 'treatment', 'longer', 'symptoms', 'report', 'effective', 'developing', 'protection', 'data', 'work', 'ukhsa', 'covid', '88', 'booster', 'hospital', 'long'];"
A booster vaccine is 88% effective at preventing people ending up in hospital with Covid-19, new data from the UK Health Security Agency suggests.
The new data confirms that two doses of the AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna vaccines offers little protection against being infected with Omicron. 
But protection against severe disease appears to be holding up much better against the new variant.
Health officials said this reinforces the importance of getting a third dose.
The health secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This is more promising data which reinforces just how important vaccines are. They save lives and prevent serious illness. 
""This analysis shows you are up to eight times more likely to end up in hospital as a result of Covid-19 if you are unvaccinated.""
The UKHSA analysed more than 600,000 confirmed and suspected cases of the Omicron variant up to 29 December in England.
It found that a single vaccine dose reduced the risk of needing hospital treatment by 52%. Adding the second dose increased the protection to 72%, although after 25 weeks that protection had faded to 52%. 
And two weeks after getting a third dose, that protection against hospitalisation was boosted to 88%. 
The UKHSA report said there was not enough data yet to work out how long this protection would last but it is expected to last longer than protection against developing symptoms.
In people who already had symptoms, protection after each dose was slightly lower and reduced to 68% after a booster compared to unvaccinated people.
A second study, carried out with Cambridge University, confirmed that the risk of going to A&E or being admitted to a hospital ward after catching Omicron was roughly half that of the older Delta variant.
It also found that the risk of hospital admission alone with Omicron was approximately one-third of that for Delta.
Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, said the data was ""in keeping with the encouraging signs we have already seen"".
However she said it was too early to draw any conclusions on how severely ill in hospital people could be with Omicron compared to Delta.
She added: ""The increased transmissibility of omicron and the rising cases in the over 60s population in England means it remains highly likely that there will be significant pressure on the NHS in coming weeks.
""The data once again shows that coming forward for your jab, particularly your third dose, is the best way of protecting yourself and others against infection and severe disease.""

19;Obituary: Betty White, the Golden Girl with a heart of gold;['2021-12-31T19:43:03.000Z'];['BBC News'];['television'];['working', 'white', 'golden', 'world', 'betty', 'services', 'heart', 'war', 'obituary', 'second', 'went', 'moved', 'gold', 'womens', 'voluntary', 'work', 'girl'];"
Betty White was US television's Golden Girl with the heart of gold, celebrated for her comic acting abilities from TV's early days up to the 21st Century, while remaining committed to her animal activism.
""I have to keep acting so that I can afford to keep doing my charity work!"" she joked to The Hollywood Reporter in 2018.
Born in Illinois in 1922, White became one of America's original screen stars, enjoying a career that encompassed eight decades and earned her many accolades.
As an only child, she moved with her family to Los Angeles during the height of The Great Depression, and in the late 1930s began working as an actress and model. Her fledgling career had to be put on hold, though, during the Second World War, when she went to work with the American Women's Voluntary Services.
After the war, White continued with her showbiz ambitions with mixed success, before landing her own radio show and then appearing on Al Jarvis's Hollywood on Television variety talk show.
She died on Friday, weeks before her 100th birthday.
Clearly a burgeoning talent, she took over the reins of the TV show in the early 1950s, and was subsequently nominated for her first Emmy Award for best TV actress in 1951. It was the new awards' first ever category to recognise the achievements of women on the box.
Next came the TV sitcom Life with Elizabeth - a show she launched herself, alongside George Tibbles. ""He wrote and I produced,"" she explained. ""I was one of the first women producers in Hollywood.""
White kept her profile high with many chat show appearances, and met her third husband (and ""love of my life"") Allen Ludden on the game show Password in 1961. The couple were married from 1963 until Ludden's death in 1981.
The actress's biggest role so far came as Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show in the 1970s. Her sharp-witted character, who had an eye for the men, worked alongside the sitcom's titular star in a fictional Minneapolis television newsroom.
The job won White two more Emmy Awards and set her up for what would become her most famous role, as the naive-but-loveable Rose Nylund in The Golden Girls, which carried her through the 1980s and 90s.
Nylund was a Norwegian-American who moved to Miami after the death of her husband and formed a later life bond with three other women, played by Beatrice Arthur, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty.
In 1986, it won the Emmy for outstanding comedy and White scooped the individual award for best comedy actress.
""I am the lucky one who gets to come up and pick up this beautiful golden girl,"" she said in her acceptance speech. ""But Estelle and Rue and Bea and I all thank you - we're a match-set, you can't split us up.""
After The Golden Girls went off air in 1992, White - who was by then also a published author - appeared in the short-lived spin-off Golden Palace.
She also had a recurring role on soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful from 2006 to 2009, and hosted several other entertainment shows, including the prank show Betty White's Off Their Rockers.
But her career caught fire again in 2010, when she starred in another sitcom, Hot in Cleveland, opposite Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves and Wendie Malick.
""It's just a terrific show. The chemistry between the girls is so great,"" White told Newsweek.
The same year, the veteran also became the oldest ever host of Saturday Night Live, following a Facebook campaign to get her on the prime-time show.
Her 90th birthday in 2012 was marked with an all-star television special featuring her old co-star Tyler Moore, Ellen DeGeneres and Carl Reiner, as well as Tina Fey and Ed Asner.
Still making movies into her 90s, White joined an all-star cast in 2019's Toy Story 4, voicing a tiger teething toy named Bitey White.
Animals (real ones, not toys) were always a passion, and she worked closely with the Los Angeles Zoo and the Morris Animal Foundation for more than four decades.
""I'm actually the luckiest old broad alive,"" she said. ""Half my life is working in a profession I love and the other half is working with animals.""
In 2015, she was honoured with a lifetime achievement Emmy Award - her eighth Emmy in total.
""She is one of the most beloved female performers in the history of television,"" said Bob Mauro of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, who described White as an ""American institution"".
""Betty's career as a female pioneer has followed television from literally the beginning of the medium, winning her first Emmy Award in 1952, to the digital-streaming future, winning again in 2010.""
Emmy vice-president David Michaels went on to say that White was ""also one of the nicest women in showbusiness"".

21;Why do people link hands to sing Auld Lang Syne?;['2021-12-31T12:59:02.000Z'];['BBC News'];['music'];['world', 'global', 'hands', 'sing', 'burns', 'bind', 'auld', 'inhabited', 'lang', 'ties', 'syne', 'song', 'rooted', 'link'];"
On New Year's Eve millions of people around the world link hands when they sing Auld Lang Syne.
Now research from the University of Edinburgh has revealed the origins of the Hogmanay tradition are connected to freemasonry.
Singing with arms crossed and hands joined was a parting ritual at many Masonic lodges.
Musicologist Dr Morag Grant discovered the connection in the archives at Glasgow's Mitchell Library.
A newspaper report of an Ayrshire lodge's Burns Supper in 1879 describes Auld Lang Syne being sung as members formed ""the circle of unity"" - a Masonic ritual also called the ""chain of union"".
Dr Grant said the tradition of singing the song at times of parting, with crossed hands, emerged in the mid-19th century among Freemasons and other fraternal organisations.
""Auld Lang Syne's sentiments didn't just resonate with Freemasons,"" she said.
""Some of the earliest reports of the song's use at parting come from American college graduations in the 1850s.""
""The many traditions and rituals associated with the song - as well as its simple, singable tune - are key to understanding its phenomenal spread, and why we still sing it today.""
Robert Burns was a Freemason. The organisation was instrumental in promoting the poet's work during his life and after his death.
He was inspired to write Auld Lang Syne by fragments of earlier folk songs. He wrote the lyrics in 1788 but the tune did not appear together with the song until after his death.
In the final verse the singer offers his hand of friendship to an old friend, and asks for one in return.
Burns wrote: ""And there's a hand, my trusty fiere. And gie's a hand o' thine.""
Traditionally, at this point the hands are crossed and offered to the those on either side in the circle of singers.
Dr Grant uncovered the masonic link while researching her book Auld Lang Syne: A Song And Its Culture, which explores how its popularity spread around the world.
She studied sources including written accounts, newspaper reports, theatre playbills, printed music and early recordings.
Dr Grant suggests Auld Lang Syne's global fame predates the invention of sound recording and the broadcast era.
The song had already spread to Japan where it was played at graduations. The tune - known as Hotaru no hikari - is still played at the close of business in some shops.
In 1877, Alexander Graham Bell used it to demonstrate the telephone, and in 1890 it was one of the first songs recorded on Emil Berliner's gramophone.
The song's use at new year emerged around the same time, through Scots gathering outside St Paul's Cathedral in London and others living abroad.
The Scouts also played a key role in its global fame. It was sung at the end of the first World Scout Jamboree in 1920 and versions in French, German, Greek and Polish soon followed.
By 1929, the new year tradition was so well established internationally that a line from the song was displayed on the electronic ticker at celebrations in Times Square, New York.
Dr Grant said: ""It's remarkable how this song, written in a language which even most Scots don't fully understand, has become so synonymous with new year the world over.
""Auld Lang Syne is a song about the ties that bind us to others across the years and even though its appeal is now global, it's very much rooted in the world Burns inhabited.""

22;Xi'an: Cries for help and food in quarantined Chinese city;['2021-12-31T09:33:28.000Z'];['BBC News'];['china', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['chinese', 'food', 'ordered', 'days', 'help', 'xian', 'supplies', 'getting', 'sign', 'read', 'posted', 'cries', 'heard', 'city', 'online', 'vegetables', 'quarantined'];"
Some residents under lockdown in the Chinese city of Xi'an say they do not have enough food, even as officials insist there are adequate supplies.
More than 13 million were ordered to stay at home last week as authorities sought to battle a Covid outbreak.
But compared to other lockdowns globally, locals cannot go out even for essential reasons like buying food.
The government is delivering supplies but many on social media say they are yet to receive them and are struggling.
The lockdown on the northern city of Xi'an is in its ninth day. The city's outbreak is the worst China has seen in months amid its zero-Covid strategy.
Initially, the restrictions had allowed one person per household to venture out once every two days to buy food and other basic supplies.
But the rules were tightened on Monday - banning residents from leaving at all except to get tested for Covid-19.
In past days, people have taken to the Weibo social media platform to call for help with getting food and other essentials. Many said they hadn't received their government supplies yet.
""I heard other districts are gradually getting supplies, but I didn't get anything. My compound bans us from going out. I ordered some groceries online four days ago, but no sign of getting it at all. I haven't been able to get any vegetables for days,"" read one comment posted on Friday.
Another person said: ""The allocation is so uneven. The district I'm based in hasn't got anything. We are told to group up and order together. The price is very high as well.""
One video taken this week which has been circulating online shows residents in a Xi'an compound arguing heatedly with police over the lack of food.
A man tells authorities that his family has run out of food, and a woman can be heard saying: ""We've been locked down for 13 days. Resident's basic life can't be sustained. We queued for three to four hours [to buy vegetables]. But they don't allow it to be sold anymore."" 
State-owned newspaper Global Times said that in some places, food was being delivered to housing compounds' entrances but there were not enough volunteers to deliver the supplies to residents' doorsteps. There was also a citywide shortage of deliverymen as many drivers were under quarantine themselves.
Authorities had admitted on Wednesday that ""low staff attendance and difficulties in logistics and distribution"" had led to problems providing essential supplies to the city.
By Thursday however, the country's commerce ministry told reporters that Xi'an's residents had ""sufficient"" access to essential supplies, AFP news agency reported. 
State television outlets also broadcast images of workers in hazmat suits sorting various essential food items like eggs, meat and vegetables into plastic bags, before delivering them to residents door-to-door.
""We got free groceries from the government. It's actually quite a lot. It's enough for a family to eat for three or four days,"" one person who received their supplies wrote on Weibo.
China's adoption of a strict zero-Covid strategy saw the city closing bus stations, cancelling outward bound flights, and conducting millions of tests in Shaanxi province, where Xi'an is located. 
Xi'an has logged more than 1300 virus cases since 9 December. The latest outbreak has thrown into doubt China's ability to maintain its zero-Covid approach as it gears up to host the 2022 Winter Olympics in February.
China has termed Covid ""the biggest threat"" to the major international sporting event. 
The country, where the virus was first recorded, has now confirmed more than 131,300 cases and 5,699 deaths, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization.

23;Year in tech: The stories making headlines in 2021;['2021-12-31T01:01:04.000Z'];['By Jane Wakefield'];['meta', 'nfts', 'semiconductors'];['2021', 'making', 'hyped', 'facebook', 'headlines', 'words', 'rapidly', 'mark', 'tech', 'enthusiasm', 'focus', 'month', 'metaverse', 'zuckerberg'];"
2021 introduced us to tech terms including Metaverse and NFT (non-fungible token).
Facebook took a dramatic new direction, heading off into virtual reality.
The internet, which had held up remarkably well over a series of lockdowns, experienced a few wobbles. 
And we learned that those chips in all our devices, which we take for granted, weren't infinite.
Here's our rundown of some of the biggest stories on the BBC Technology site over the past year.
Even though he lost the presidential election at the end of 2020, Donald Trump continued to make headlines into 2021.
On the 7 January, he was briefly locked out of his Twitter account after posting false claims of voter fraud. Just 12 hours later, he was allowed to tweet again. but a few days later was permanently suspended.
The tweet that led to the ban was seen as particularly inflammatory given the storming of the Capitol building just the day before.
The events acted as a wake-up call to social media networks which had previously allowed politicians to have, more or less, free rein posting online.
Facebook also chose to ban the former US president; six months on, in June, it was decided that Trump would remain barred from Facebook for two years.
During the course of the year both Facebook and Twitter adopted new rules on how to deal with the high-profile accounts of world leaders and politicians.
Of course it was not the last we heard from Mr Trump - but more on that later.
WhatsApp's plans to change its privacy policies to make it easier for people to message businesses, faced a backlash as millions downloaded apps from its competitors, worried that the plan meant large amounts of information on the messaging platform would be shared with Facebook.
Facebook insisted the changes did not mark a dramatic shift, but admitted that communication had been poor.
Privacy advocates said it merely highlighted that WhatsApp was already harvesting huge amounts of data for its parent firm.
A few days after the backlash was reported in the media, WhatsApp revealed that those who did not accept its updated terms and conditions would be unable to receive or send messages after the 15 May deadline.
Later in the year, WhatsApp was forced to rewrite its privacy policy following a £190m fine imposed by the Irish data protection authority. It subsequently had to provide much more information about what exactly it does with user information.
In Spring, anti-virus creator John McAfee, who has always been a controversial figure, was charged with fraud - accused of promoting crypto-currencies on Twitter in order to inflate the price.
At the time, he was already being detained in Spain on separate charges relating to tax evasion.
A few months later, a Spanish court agreed to extradite him to the US. But just a few hours later he was found dead in his cell - believed to have taken his own life.
It has been a year dominated by chip shortages - the result of a combination of factors, including the pandemic and the sharp increase in demand for certain goods as everyone adapted to working, learning and socialising at home.
In April, Cisco became one of the first to warn that the computer chip shortage was a problem, although its suggestion that it might last for six months proved to be rather optimistic.
Later in the year, the boss of chip firm Arm suggested that the problem could run until next Christmas.
Trump was back in the headlines in May with news that he had launched his own communications platform which would publish content ""straight from the desk"" of the former US president.
Some pointed out that it seemed to be little more than a glorified 1990-style blog - and just a month later it was shut down.
Later in the year, he unveiled a slightly more sophisticated effort to exert his influence on social media, with plans to launch an app called Truth Social in 2022.
It has raised $1bn to date, but has also courted controversy and is facing an investigation from the SEC.
In June, a major internet outage affected a number of high-profile websites including Amazon, Reddit, Twitch, the Guardian and the New York Times.
Cloud computing provider Fastly admitted responsibility. It runs what is known as an edge cloud, which is designed to speed up loading times from websites. Later it emerged that one customer changing their settings had triggered the bug.
Similar problems plagued Amazon Web Services, Akamai and Cloudflare during the year, prompting some to question the reliance on a handful of companies to keep the internet working.
One of Silicon Valley's original innovators, Jeff Bezos, stepped down from Amazon, exactly 27 years after he founded the online retail giant. For many he was a business visionary, and the company he started bears this out - worth $1.8trn at the time of his departure.
But like all tech giants, Amazon is facing increased scrutiny, over how it treats its warehouse workers, for example, as well as questions over whether it monopolises online retail. 
Mr Bezos isn't planning to walk out of the limelight however. His latest obsession is Space - in October he and Star Trek's original Captain Kirk, aka William Shatner, blasted into sub-orbit in his rocket, Blue Origin.
This year we learned that NFT stood for Non-Fungible Token. Less understood was what it meant - essentially a digital token that can be used as a way of paying for digital collectibles.
But for those who got it, it was a great way to make a quick buck - like 12-year-old Benyamin Ahmed, who made £290,000 from some pixelated artworks called Weird Whales that he had made during his school holidays.
Elsewhere, an NFT of an animated cat GIF sold for more than £365,000, while Jack Dorsey's first ever tweet hit £2.5m and Tim Berners-Lee web source code NFT went for a cool $5.4m.
But the NFT craze was not without its critics: author David Gerard describes NFTS as the ""new form of worthless magic bean"".
Either way, it was hard to ignore, and NFT made it into Collins dictionary of new words for 2021 - along with Metaverse.
Every so often a strange tale hits tech - and none was stranger than the warning that iPhone owners should be wary that powerful motorbikes could damage their camera systems.
The document, published by Apple and spotted by MacRumours, suggested that engine vibrations could harm the phones' optical-image stabilisation or closed-loop autofocus systems.
The BBC's retelling of the story got millions of hits.
In October, there were two major Facebook stories - one of which broke all records for tech index readership. But strangely that accolade went not to the radical company rebrand to Meta, but to a story about Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram being inaccessible for a few hours.
It was also the month that Facebook announced its new focus on the metaverse - a concept that has rapidly become one of the most hyped words of 2021, and one which Mark Zuckerberg seems to have endless enthusiasm for.
Essentially, it is a virtual reality version of the internet in which Meta, along with some other big names in tech, believes we will live, play and work at some point in the future.
Of course, the more cynical wondered if the newfound enthusiasm for the metaverse - which came with not just a company rebrand, but a plan to hire 10,000 people in the EU to build it - was a distraction from Facebook's ongoing issues with real-world content.
Its been quite a year for cyber crime, with record numbers of ransomware attacks and some serious bugs uncovered. In November our cyber reporter, Joe Tidy, set off to find some of the most wanted hackers from the notorious network Evil Corp - many of whom are based in Russia.
It took him to a golf course and a shiny skyscraper in Moscow. He didn't find the hackers, but he did learn that they were making a huge amount of money - alongside driving the requisite Lamborghinis, hosting plush weddings and keeping exotic pets.
Any direct links to the Russian state are denied by the Kremlin, but experts believe that hackers are allowed to flourish in the country provided they don't target Russian nationals. While US law enforcement claims they are also enlisted for state hacking.
This year there has been a renewed surge of disinformation around vaccinations, Covid and politics.
Technology has not been immune to conspiracy theories either, with attacks on 5G transmitters from those who believe they omit dangerous radio waves.
Despite no evidence the transmitters cause any harm, the theory has spawned a range of products which claim to protect people against them. 
The BBC has previously reported on the issue, from anti-radiation stickers for sale on Amazon, to a USB stick which UK Trading Standards described as a ""scam"".
Then, as the year ended - in an ironic twist - an anti-5G necklace was found to be radioactive by the Dutch authority for nuclear safety and radiation protections.

24;Covid-19: How India missed its vaccination target;['2021-12-31T04:59:58.000Z'];['By Shruti Menon'];['coronavirus vaccines', 'india', 'reality check', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['organisation', 'covid19', 'ministry', 'world', 'india', 'missed', 'vaccine', 'programme', 'start', 'million', 'target', 'vaccination', 'health', 'number', 'wasted'];"
India has missed the target of giving its entire adult population of 940 million two vaccinations by the end of 2021. 
The target was first announced by Prakash Javadekar in May, who was a minister in the federal government at the time.
""Vaccination in India will be completed by December 2021,"" he said.
As of 30 December, 64% of India's adult population is fully vaccinated and around 90% has received the first dose. 
Experts said achieving the target of full vaccination coverage would take a long time. 
Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and health systems specialist, says the target set by the government was ""unrealistic"" because achieving 100% vaccine coverage at any given point would not be possible.
""There would always be some people who are unwilling to get vaccinated for various reasons,"" he said.
Weekly vaccinations have slowed since the first week of December, according to India's vaccine dashboard - CoWin.
Since mid-October, more second doses have been given than first doses.
The daily vaccination numbers have been fluctuating with the highest number achieved on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday on 17 September. 
Over 20 million jabs were administered on the day but the country has not been able to achieve the same number since. 
While the monthly average for September was around 8.1 million doses a day, it fell to 5.4 million in October and 5.7 million in November. 
Some experts say if the September momentum had been kept up, India could have been closer to the target, but that demand would eventually have fallen.
The vaccination drive, which started in January, faced challenges such as supply constraints due to raw materials shortages, logistical issues and vaccine hesitancy.
By the second half of the year, the supply constraints had been addressed.
The challenge is now the demand rather than the supply.
""The vaccination drive has slowed down now because people are hesitant to take the vaccine,"" says Dr Lahariya.
On 3 November, the government launched a vaccination programme to conduct at-home inoculations. 
A month after the programme was announced, the first dose coverage had only increased by 6% and second dose coverage by 12%. 
Mr Modi has now asked states to ramp up vaccinations in districts with low uptake amid Omicron fears.
Over the past few months, the 100% target has not been mentioned in any of the press conferences by the health ministry. 
We asked the ministry about missing the target but did not hear back.
India is currently administering two locally-manufactured vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, and the Russian vaccine Sputnik. 
India's largest vaccine maker, Serum Institute of India (SII), was manufacturing 250 million doses of Covishield a month before the company announced production cuts in December due to a lack of orders.
It now produces between 125 and 150 million doses a month.
Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin, makes 50 to 60 million doses a month.
India's health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, recently said in parliament that states had a stock of 170 million vaccines as of 20 December. 
He added that the vaccine manufacturing capacity would rise from the current 310 million doses a month to 450 million doses a month in the next two months. 
This may include vaccines from other manufacturers. The junior minister of health, Dr Bharati Pawar, said: ""Both companies [Bharat Biotech and SII] have achieved 90% of their production capacity."" 
The government has announced jabs for children aged 15 to 18 years and a booster programme for health workers and those above 60 years with other health conditions starting this month.
SII chief, Adar Poonawalla, said earlier this month that the company has 500 million vaccines in stock in case the government announces a booster programme. 
The health ministry has said that around 6.2 million doses have been wasted since the start of the vaccine programme, which is considerably below the number that the World Health Organisation (WHO) would expect to be wasted.
There are other Indian-made vaccines expected to be used against Covid.
Novavax, developed in the US and named Covavax in India, is being manufactured by SII - and has been granted emergency use listing by the WHO. It has also been granted approval by India. 
SII has told the BBC that it is currently stockpiling these vaccine doses, and the capacities to manufacture this vaccine would be separate from Covishield.
Bharat Biotech has sought approval for trials of its intranasal vaccine as a booster shot. 
Corbevax, manufactured by Biological-E, has also been granted approval in India.
India did give emergency use approval to the US-made Moderna vaccine in June, but so far no doses have been sent to India.
Johnson & Johnson's single dose vaccine was granted approval in August but so far it hasn't been administered.
Supplies of foreign-made vaccines are facing legal hurdles over the manufacturers' desire for protection against legal claims arising out of using the vaccines - something no vaccine maker in India has at the moment.
What about vaccine exports?
With the vaccine demand in India slowing and daily cases falling, SII resumed exporting vaccines in November to Covax, the global vaccine-sharing programme.
Before exports were halted by India in April, Covax was reliant on supplies from SII to support the vaccine programmes in low and middle-income countries.
But exports have been slow and Covax has since relied on other vaccines. 
Of the 700 million vaccines that have been delivered to 144 countries by Covax as of 14 December, around 40 million doses were provided by SII. 
Around 28 million of those doses were supplied between January and April 2021, according to Covax.

25;The Corozal: Scottish dredger that helped build the Panama Canal;['2021-12-31T06:02:24.000Z'];['By Gillian Sharpe'];['shipbuilding', 'paisley'];['pressley', 'paisley', 'john', 'corozal', 'panama', 'canal', 'museum', 'looking', 'yard', 'quite', 'stood', 'helped', 'simons', 'picture', 'dredger', 'build', 'scottish'];"
It was known as a wee ship that went a long way to do a big thing. 
The Panama Canal is widely regarded as one of the 20th Century's engineering marvels and the Renfrew-built dredger, the Corozal, was instrumental in constructing what is often seen as one of its toughest and most dangerous sections.  
Staff at Paisley Museum rediscovered a mislaid contemporary model of the ship when they were moving premises and it set them off researching a remarkable story which will feature prominently when the refurbished museum reopens in 2023. 
""It's quite hard to picture when you see it now,"" says John Pressley of Paisley Museum, looking out across the Clyde to where the Simon's yard once stood. It is now covered by housing. 
""Previously, this whole place would have been an absolute hive of industry - noise and smoke. They were building dredgers which pretty much helped to build the world,"" he adds.
""Building new harbours, new docks, expanding waterways, creating better trade routes.""
The United States began work on the Panama Canal in 1904, aiming to cut out thousands of dangerous sea miles between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
As an American project the government there wanted equipment and material to come from America. 
But it was a Scottish yard  - Simons of Renfrew  - which, in 1911, beat the competition with a bid which was less than half that of its San Francisco competitor.
The Corozal's job was leading the ships working on the Culebra Cut, which was a difficult section of the canal, prone to mudslides.
""It was the most powerful dredger that had ever been built,"" says Mr Pressley.
A workforce of about 18,000 had been chipping away with picks, shovels and dynamite and once a certain point was reached the Cut was flooded and the dredgers could come in.  
""The Corozal then came in and did a lot of this excavation work,"" Mr Pressley explained.
""It was not there alone. I think there were about 33 other dredgers, which gives you an idea of the scale of the work they were carrying out.""
A model of the Corozal from the time it was built was rediscovered when Paisley Museum staff were moving to a new store. 
It shows in detail how it all worked; in effect a ladder of huge buckets to scoop out soil and mud.
""There are these huge excavating buckets which could churn out tonnes of soil every scoop,"" says Mr Pressley.
""There's an amazing picture of one of these buckets in the shipyard and there's 12 men stuck inside. 
""I think there's 50 buckets on that ladder so it really could churn out an awful lot of dirt and soil.""
After it was finished in December 1913, the Corozal was the first ship to sail through the Culebra Cut, the last barrier to the canal opening the following year.
In its heyday there were yards for all kinds of ships along the Clyde; passenger vessels, liners, naval ships.
What happened on the river - including the Corozal - went worldwide. 
""The Clyde was an absolute powerhouse of building,"" says Abigail McIntyre of the Scottish Maritime Museum. 
""And the specialisms had this ripple effect around the world.
""So having a dredger being built on the banks at Renfrew it just proves how even some of the smallest yards could have such a big impact on the world stage.""

26;James Webb: A $10bn machine in search of the end of darkness;['2021-12-15T00:59:20.000Z'];['By Jonathan Amos'];['astronomy', 'nasa', 'stars', 'the universe', 'james webb space telescope', 'hubble telescope', 'space exploration'];['diameter', 'sure', 'webb', 'starlight', 'scales', 'end', '10bn', 'square', 'machine', 'signal', 'darkness', 'search', 'telescope', 'mirror', 'reach', 'james', 'thats'];"
Darkness. Total and complete. Few of us get to experience it. 
At the bottom of a cave, perhaps; or in a basement when the power shuts off. But there's usually some faint glow coming from somewhere. Even the night sky never seems truly black, not least because there's usually a star or two twinkling in the distance.
So it's hard to imagine a time when all that existed was darkness, when you could travel in any direction for millions of years and still see absolutely nothing.
But this is the story that scientists tell us, of the ""dark ages"" that gripped the Universe before the first stars ignited. And very shortly, they intend to show us that time, or rather how it ended - how the cosmos ultimately became filled with light.
They'll do it using the biggest telescope ever placed beyond the Earth: The James Webb Space Telescope.
Launching in the coming days, JWST is on a mission to look deeper into the Universe - and therefore further back in time - than even the legendary Hubble Space Telescope, which it succeeds.
Equipped with a 6.5m-wide (21ft) mirror and four super-sensitive instruments, Webb will stare for days at a very narrow spot on the sky to detect light that has been travelling through the immensity of space for more than 13.5 billion years.
""They will be just little red specks,"" says JWST senior project scientist and Nobel Prize winner John Mather.
""We think there should be stars, or galaxies, or black holes maybe beginning at 100 million years after the Big Bang. There won't be many of them to find at that time but the Webb telescope can see them if they're there, and we're lucky,"" the US space agency (Nasa) researcher tells a special edition of Discovery on the BBC World Service.
It's an astounding idea that you might still be able to witness such a thing. But that's the consequence of light having a finite speed in a vast and expanding cosmos. If you keep probing deeper and deeper, you should eventually get to retrieve the light from the pioneer stars as they group together into the first galaxies.
For what purpose, though? Why spend 10 years conceiving, and another 20 years building, a $10bn machine to detect some faint, red blobs on the sky?
Well, essentially it comes down to the most fundamental of questions: Where do we come from? 
When the Universe was formed in the Big Bang, it contained only hydrogen, helium and a smattering of lithium. Nothing else.
All the chemical elements in the Periodic Table heavier than these three had to be forged in stars. All the carbon that makes up living things; all the nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere; all the silicon in rocks - all these atoms had to be ""manufactured"" in the nuclear reactions that make stars shine, and in the mighty explosions that end their existence.
We're only here because the first stars and their descendants seeded the Universe with the material to make stuff.
""Webb's mission is about the formation of all likeness; it's the 'we're all made of stardust' argument,"" ponders Rebecca Bowler, a University of Oxford astronomer who's a team-member on Webb's NIRSpec instrument.
""It's about the formation of the first carbon atom ever. It's absolutely amazing to me that we could actually observe that process in progress.""
We don't know much about the first stars. We can put the laws of physics into computer models and run them to get a sense of what might be possible. And it sounds fantastical.
""Estimates range from anywhere of order 100 to 1,000 times the mass of our Sun,"" says Marcia Rieke, the principal investigator on Webb's NIRCam instrument. ""And, in fact, all stars follow the rule that the length of time they can exist as a star is inversely proportional to their mass - meaning, the more massive a star, the faster it uses up its fuel. And so these early stars might have only lasted at most a million years or so.""
Live fast, die young. Our own Sun seems so timid in comparison. It's already burned for nearly five billion years and will probably keep on burning for another five.

The emphasis on the search for the first starlight makes Webb sound like a ""one note flute"". It's actually anything but. 
It'll observe just about everything there is to see out there beyond Earth - from the icy moons and comets in our own Solar System to the colossal black holes that seem to reside at the core of all galaxies. It should be particularly adept at studying planets around other suns. 
Webb has, however, been tuned to look at all its targets in a very particular way... in the infrared. 
Hubble was designed to be sensitive to light predominantly at optical, or visible, wavelengths. That's the same type of light we detect with our eyes. 
Webb, on the other hand, is set up specifically to detect longer wavelengths, which, although invisible to our eyes, are exactly in the regime where the glow from the most distant objects in the Universe will show up. 
""Distant starlight gets stretched by the expansion of the Universe and shifts into the infrared region of the spectrum. We call it redshift,"" explains Richard Ellis, a University College London astronomer who's impatient to explore the end of the dark ages. 
""The limiting factor we have with Hubble, for example, is that it doesn't reach far enough into the infrared to detect the starlight signal we want. It's also not a particularly large telescope. It's been a pioneering facility, for sure. Amazing pictures. But the diameter of its mirror is only 2.4m, and the power of a telescope scales with the square of the diameter of the mirror. And that's where JWST comes in.""
It was the 18th-Century astronomer William Herschel who discovered the infrared. He also revolutionised the production of telescope mirrors. 
His hand-cranked polishing machines could achieve a super-smooth reflecting surface on a disc cast from an alloy of tin and copper. 
Herschel would have appreciated the innovation that went into producing Webb's mirrors. 
They're made from the metal beryllium, which is light-weight and holds its shape at very low temperatures. And then there's the gold coating. It's extremely thin, just a few hundred atoms thick, but this addition turns the mirrors into near-perfect reflectors in the infrared.
Ninety-eight percent of incident light is bounced back, ensuring the emission from distant stars experiences minimal loses by the time it reaches Webb's instruments.
Anyone who's seen the telescope's segmented 6.5m primary mirror will attest to its mesmerising quality. Even those who've worked on it for two decades never tire of its beauty. 
""There was a time when the mirror was pointed downwards and I had to climb under it to do an inspection of the aft optics,"" recalls Nasa's Lee Feinberg, who's led the Webb mirror team. 
""So, there I was in my bunny suit, looking up at all those gold surfaces and seeing myself being reflected back. It was really quite amazing - all these surfaces focusing back on me. I had this incredible feeling of energy being at the centre of it all."" 
Hubble famously had a major problem with its primary mirror. 
When the telescope arrived in orbit in 1990, scientists realised the reflector hadn't been polished correctly. Its initial pictures of galaxies were blurred. 
It wasn't until astronauts could take up some corrective optics that Hubble started to see the cosmos with clarity. And perhaps not unreasonably, it's because of that experience that everyone asks whether Webb's mirror can be guaranteed to be flawless. 
August 2017 was the month that saw Hurricane Harvey stall over Texas, dumping a staggering 127 billion tonnes of rainwater on the state. 
It's noteworthy because in the midst of that deluge, Webb was actually ""in town"", in Houston, at Nasa's Johnson Space Center, undergoing critical testing that would prove its optics were fit to fly. 
Engineers had put the telescope in the space simulator that was used in the 1960s to run the rule over Apollo hardware, and even space-suited astronauts. 
Chamber A, as the vacuum vessel is known, is gargantuan in volume, and was able to swallow the telescope whole (minus its sunshield). The purpose of the three-month test was to take Webb down to its operating space temperature of just below -233C (40 kelvin), to see if all its mirrors would focus as designed. 
It would also give the teams working on Webb's four instruments the chance to see how their systems performed in mock off-world conditions. Assuming, that is, Hurricane Harvey would oblige.
At times, the computer consoles talking to Webb inside Chamber A had to be covered in plastic sheeting to protect them from the risk of water dripping from the ceiling. But tucked away behind the thick walls of the vacuum vessel, Webb itself was secure and demonstrating it didn't have a ""Hubble problem"". 
""The segments on the primary mirror have actuators behind them that allow us to move them around, to even change their curvature,"" explains Lee Feinberg. ""When first deployed in space, those segments will be misaligned. But all those actuators will take us from a misalignment measured in millimetres, all the way down to just nanometres. A factor of a million improvement."" 
Those actuators will make the 18 segments behave as though they're a single, monolithic mirror. 
Nasa instrument systems engineer Begoña Vila adds: ""This is what we demonstrated in the test chamber. We know when we first focus on a star in space, we'll actually see 18 different spots of light because the 18 individual mirror segments won't be aligned. But then we'll adjust the mirrors to bring all the spots together to make a single star that's not aberrated and good for normal operations. We know Webb works.""

Gillian Wright is carrying a Tupperware box. 
""This isn't any old Tupperware; it's space-qualified Tupperware. It meets all the international standards for keeping things flawlessly clean for years,"" the UK Astronomy Technology Centre director says. 
If you want to understand just how brilliant Webb is, but also why it's taken so long to build - some 20 years in the construction phase - you need to look in Gillian's plastic box. 
It contains a spare ""slicing mirror"" from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) that she and colleagues have built for the telescope. 
About the size of a British 50-pence piece, it looks like a mini musical accordion made for a doll. The little mirror - once again coated in gold - contains a series of slanted ""steps"". 
The arrangement allows the mirror to acquire both an image of the sky but also to chop up the light from, say, a galaxy or the edge of a black hole, and then send that light into a spectrograph. This device will reveal the chemistry, temperature, density and velocity of the targets under study. 
""But not just at one point in the image, but at every point across the image, all at the same time. You go from 2D to 3D - to what we call a data cube,"" she tells me. 
This had been done in ground-based astronomy, but was novel for Webb. What's more the level of engineering precision required was extremely challenging. The steps had to be very carefully machined so that they had supremely sharp edges, otherwise light of different wavelengths would bleed across the mirror, contaminating the data. 
It took a year to convince the space agencies that MIRI's slicing mirrors would meet the specifications. And here's the thing: this is but one small component in one part of a giant telescope.  
When they assembled Webb, every such element had to be tested and then tested again when joined to another element. The whole edifice was built up like a Russian doll. 
Former Nasa project scientist Mark Clampin explains: ""Because it's such a big and complex observatory, and also because it has to work at cryogenic temperatures, you can't just put everything together at once, and then test it. You put everything into sealed, thermally isolated packages, starting with the smallest pieces and working upwards, testing at every stage. And then as everything gets bigger and bigger, it becomes virtually impossible to go back because you found a problem in a detector, let's say."" 
Imagine towards the end of the telescope's construction they realised one of MIRI's slicing mirrors was defective. 
Disassembling the multi-billion-dollar observatory to get at the sub-standard part would be the nightmare of all nightmares. 
Mark McCaughrean is a British infrared astronomer who's worked on the project for 23 years in an advisory capacity for the European Space Agency. He's seen bits and pieces of Webb before, but just weeks before the expected launch, from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana, he's getting the chance to examine the completed observatory for the first time.
""I have no idea what to say. It's astonishing."" There's emotion in his voice. 
The mirrors and insulation blankets are a blaze of gold and silver. The latter colour has a slight purple tinge to it. We're viewing Webb in its folded configuration, but still it's the size of a single decker bus. 
This ""bus"" has been upended to fit snuggly in the nosecone of its Ariane launch rocket. 
""It has an amazing scale to it,"" comments Mark. ""When it unfolds in space - a bird flying freely in space - wouldn't that be a thing to see!"" 
Webb has had to battle the naysayers all through its development. ""It's too complex,"" they would say. And when you consider the sequence of deployments the telescope must complete in order to begin its observations of the cosmos, it is kind of scary.
Engineers refer to ""single point failures"" to describe the actions, which, if they don't occur on cue and in the right order, are likely to scupper the whole undertaking. Webb must get past 344 of these decisive hurdles.
Some actions should be very straightforward, such as the deployment of a solar panel and radio antenna in the minutes immediately after launch.
Even the opening of the wings of the primary mirror ought to be regarded as a fairly standard operation. But the actions concentrated around the unfurling of the tennis court-sized shield that will keep Webb cool and protect its vision from the glare of the Sun - that's another matter.
""Some of the key hardware includes 140 release mechanisms, about 70 hinge assemblies, eight deployment motors; we have bearings, springs, gears; about 400 pulleys are needed and 90 cables, totalling 1,312ft (400m),"" says Krystal Puga from aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman.
""To perfect the sequence, we performed multiple deployment testing over several years on both small and full-size models. We practised not only the deployment but also the stowing process. This gives us the confidence that Webb is going to deploy successfully.""

For those of us who haven't been directly involved in the project, the whole unfolding process looks terrifying. What if one of the cords pulling on the super-thin membranes snags, or, worse still, snaps? 
John Mather is the calming voice. His many years on the Webb venture have led him to a philosophical position. 
""I'm confident,"" he says, ""and yet, I'm also aware that no matter how good a plan we have - and we have a very good plan - bad things can still happen. But my opinion has no effect on the hardware. And, consequently, my worrying also has no effect on the hardware. So I mostly don't worry."" 
I've left the topic until last, but it cannot pass without some comment. The cost. 
The figure everyone quotes is $10bn (£7.5bn; €9bn). It covers the direct 20-year build period, the launch and five years of operations in space. 
As a cold number, it is eye-watering. But it's worth remembering that Hubble was also very expensive. The legendary observatory had cost more than $7bn in 2021 dollars by the time it had been launched and repaired. It must be nearer twice that now.  
But given all that Hubble has shown us about the Universe, and our place in it, the old telescope seems good value. 
If Webb succeeds in showing us our atomic origins, who will continue to quibble about cost?
""On face value there's a lot of zeroes, and Europe alone has spent €700m (£600m; $800m) on James Webb,"" says former European Space Agency project manager Peter Jensen.  
""But when you look at it as a cost per inhabitant in Europe, it comes down to a cheap cup of coffee in a cheap café, drunk over a period of 20 years.""

27;Burnley's Pastor Mick: ‘If I lock this door, he dies’;['2021-12-17T00:47:52.000Z'];['By Ed Thomas'];['poverty', 'burnley', 'the church of england'];['door', 'town', 'theyre', 'im', 'lock', 'reality', 'pastor', 'sorry', 'dies', 'mick', 'offends', 'saved', 'dying', 'burnleys', 'moments', 'thats'];"
Every seven seconds - on average - a person was referred for NHS mental health support in England in September. In Burnley, that comes as no surprise to Pastor Mick - a drug-dealer-turned-lifesaver during Covid - who each day meets people struggling to survive.   
This article contains several references to suicide.
Joanne was shaken to her core 18 months ago when her partner, Robert, died suddenly. 
""It feels like it's my fault, because I didn't get the help quick enough for him,"" she says.
Robert's mental health deteriorated during the first lockdown. He couldn't cope with being stuck at home and developed suicidal thoughts. 
Joanne says she rang a mental health team two weeks before his death asking for help - and was told someone would ring Robert the next day. But she says the call never came. 
Two weeks later, Robert took his own life.
Joanne is speaking to us in Pastor Mick's new home in the heart of Burnley town centre - a former gym that closed during the pandemic. The building has been reborn as his church - and is called the Church on the Street. 
It's a big space. The original showers, lockers and mirrors are still there, but there are crucial new additions. There's a giant wooden cross by an altar and four new office rooms in the corner - used as a private quiet space for qualified mental health counsellors. 
It was Joanne who found Robert's body. Later that day, she got a call from the mental health team she'd contacted a fortnight before. 
""They were like: 'Can I speak to Robert?' 
""I said, 'He's not here no more… he's done the damage.'""
Joanne says the woman on the phone apologised and said they had been very busy. ""She said 'I'm so sorry to hear that, I wish I could have got back sooner.'""
Although Joanne doesn't blame the mental health team, she believes Robert could have been saved with early help. ""I think he'd have been all right - he'd have still been here.""
More than a year on, Joanne is still haunted by death. Each word brings back painful memories, but she wants to share how she is feeling. ""I can see the flashbacks. I can see him every day in my head - when I get up, when I go to sleep."" 
She says one day everything just became too much for her. ""I rang Pastor Mick and he told me to come down. He's been great.""
Church on the Street has been Joanne's salvation. She says it's a place where she and her family feel safe - and she's not the only one. Hundreds of others come here each week looking for hope.  
Sadly, Joanne's story is one Pastor Mick is all too familiar with. When Robert died, he says, two other young men took their lives in streets close to Robert's home. At the time, Mick was regularly handing out food parcels in a car park in Burnley. 
""I just couldn't believe what was happening. I knew I'd have to do something more and that I needed somewhere - a home - to deal with the mess and devastation left behind by Covid.""
Inside Mick's church - we spent a month there on and off - there's a friendly open-door policy. Mick wants others who have had troubles to find hope - just like he has. In his 20s, Mick was a drug dealer consumed by cocaine and violence. He has now found faith and feeds the poor. 
The church is expanding quickly - it has its own food and clothes banks. Mick also liaises with the police, housing organisations, the local council and drug rehabilitation services.
Watch - The Cost of Covid: A Year on the Front Line
Twelve months in Burnley with Pastor Mick
""What we are doing here is free. The hot food is free, the coffee is free, the tea is free, the counselling is free,"" he explains. ""We are keeping people alive. Sometimes it just puts it off for another day, but it's another day of life, a lot of them die.""
Mick is particularly concerned about the lack of access to mental health care for the most vulnerable - people who find it difficult to see their GPs, let alone get access to a bed in a support facility. 
""The help available is negligible, the mental health system is on its backside."" 
Mick blames the Covid lockdowns and the many months of restrictions for making issues worse. In Burnley, he hears stories of people who, in isolation, have spiralled down - turning to drugs and alcohol.
In September 2021, Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust says it recorded the highest monthly number of so-called ""Section 136"" detentions in its area. That's when police detain a person and take them to a place of safety if they appear to have a mental health disorder. There were 196 - more than six a day.
In response, the trust says it has expanded its street triage services for people in crisis - in partnership with the police and ambulance services.
Mick says every other person he meets is struggling with a mental health issue - whether it be anxiety, paranoia or just being unable to cope with everyday life. After a busy day, he closes the church - but then, just before he locks up, his phone rings.
It's another person in need of help - called John. We can make out some of the conversation. He sounds manic, lost and angry and is threatening to kill himself. He believes there has been a great injustice and people are out to get him.
Mick talks to John calmly and compassionately. 
""Come and see me. I'm here, I'm waiting for you. There's a brew here for you, we can talk it through.""
The deal has been agreed. John won't attempt to take his life and Mick will hang on for him. 
""[If] I lock this door, he dies, that's a fact - so the door has to stay open.""
When John arrives at the church, he's shouting, sweating and struggling to breathe. It's upsetting to see. 
""I know who they are,"" he says, shaking uncontrollably. ""They've been so horrible and nasty towards me. I've just had enough, it's been going on too long.""
Mick gently guides him over to the middle of the room.
""Come on, I want you to take a deep breath,"" says Mick, holding John in his arms. ""Take a really deep breath… All right… So tell me what the panic is?""
Fifteen minutes later, John is calmer. His breathing has stabilised and, with a cup of tea, he's eating a slice of warmed-up meat and potato pie. John tells us that just before his crisis he had called his GP panicking for a prescription - but had been told to call back in 48 hours.
John is thankful - there was nowhere else for him to go. ""Nobody else has listened - he's the only one,"" he says pointing at Mick.
Mick says if it hadn't been for BBC reports on his charitable work at the end of 2020, many people in Burnley wouldn't know they could turn to him - and finding a home for his new church might not even have been possible.
""This place is breathing new life, it's helping people. The people who don't make it through the door die.""
 We catch up with John the next day. He's smiling and like a different person. 
""You don't know what to think, what to do, who to speak to,"" he says. ""People look at you like you belong in a lunatic asylum when you speak about your mental health.""
But John also reveals he hasn't seen a GP all year and has lost faith in mental health care - describing it as ""non-existent"". Mick has referred John to the local mental health crisis team, but John has been unable to see them.
The Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust told us the use of its mental health urgent assessment centres from July to September 2021 was 75% higher than in the last three months of 2020. It also said that community mental health referrals in August this year - at nearly 600 per 100,000 adults - were nearly 50% higher than England's national average. 
Those statistics will come as no surprise to Father Alex who, like Pastor Mick, we first met a year ago. In his church, St Matthew's, pews have been replaced by tables and chairs and a place to cook hot food for those in need. 
""We have examples of people waiting 16 weeks when they're in crisis for mental health support,"" he tells us. ""So people are being talked off bridges and given crisis care [phone] numbers.""
Looking at Demi Lea and her two children - who have come for breakfast at St Matthew's - you'd never think they were struggling. But Demi Lea says she hasn't done a food shop for months and relies on food banks, charity, and handouts.
She first referred herself for mental health support at the end of 2020, got a phone consultation in June and is now on a waiting list for therapy. But in August, her mental health got even worse after the death of her grandmother - who she used to rely on for support. 
""I haven't been able to get on top of things - financially it's been tough,"" she says. ""I can barely function.""
Since we met, Father Alex has managed to arrange counselling sessions for Demi Lea. She says she's extremely grateful. 
Back at the Church on the Street, we sit down again with an exhausted Mick at the end of a busy day. We chat with him and his colleague Kev - a support worker - about the deaths of two young men, rumoured to have taken their own lives the night before. Mick and Kev are shocked but not surprised - although they caution against speculation.  
As we talk, just like the night before, there are more emergencies. Over a 30-minute period, Mick gets three panicked phone calls. 
The first is from a mum whose son ran away from home saying he was going to kill himself. The second is from another worried mum whose child is also having suicidal thoughts. Mick says the struggle for these families is to be seen quickly by professionals.
Then comes the third call.

""I can't cope with life, I just don't want to live any more,"" says a woman's softly spoken voice. ""Nobody has listened, I just want to go to sleep and not wake up.""
Mick, head in hands, tries to reassure her.
""I know that feeling,"" says Mick, ""but there is a light that is stronger than the darkness. We'll get you in here on Monday, we'll see you."" 
He then asks if she has taken any medication. ""Yes"" comes the reply - enough for an overdose. Kev dials for an ambulance straight away on his phone, while Mick keeps her conscious and talking on his. 
""I just don't want to live, Mick, I'm in a dark tunnel and can't get out,"" says the woman. He pleads with her. ""There's always hope. Make sure your doors are unlocked.""
Mick stays on the line until the paramedics arrive and make sure she is safe. But how has he ended up taking emergency calls? What happens when he can't answer the phone? Is this more than he can cope with?
He tells us there was a missed call one night when he was asleep - and the caller had left a worrying message. ""If you don't answer the phone, I'm going to kill myself.""
Unfortunately, that person did take their own life, Mick explains - his voice breaking with emotion.
A few days later when we arrive at the church one morning, we meet a man called Robbie who's 29. He has been on the streets all night, but is now sitting in the office going through his possessions - the clothes on his back and a couple of see-through plastic bags.
He's showing Mick the medication he's been prescribed. During lockdown Robbie struggled and began hearing voices. One told him to jump from a well-known bridge in Burnley. Police managed to get to Robbie just in time to stop him and he was admitted to a psychiatric unit. 
Since then, he's received six months of expert care at several psychiatric units in Lancashire - something he says has worked well. But yesterday, he was released without accommodation arranged. He says he was told to head to Burnley Borough Council's housing department, but by the time he got there it was closed.
""I just ended up walking around town all night and then as soon as this place opened I just came to Pastor Mick,"" says Robbie. ""Without this place I'd be dead.""
Mick is incandescent. He's angry that the money spent on Robbie's care has now been wasted. ""He's been released from a psychiatric unit to the street with enough drugs to kill an elephant. It's a tragedy, it doesn't need to be like this.""
Robbie begins to get upset. ""I feel confusion, suicidal - it's like they've designed it to make me do it because they don't want me here no more. But I'm just trying to better myself. I just want a better life, that's all I want. I'm sick of this.""
The next night, Church on the Street paid for Robbie to stay in a hotel. The following night he was placed by Burnley council in a shared room in a B&B above a pub. But within 72 hours he had been readmitted to a psychiatric unit.
During our visits to the church, we talk to Mick's volunteers about the struggle to get mental health support for those who desperately need it - including David Allen, a mental health counsellor with more than 20 years' experience. 
""It's not just here in Burnley, it's all over the country. And the ones that suffer most are always at the bottom of the pile. They just feel left behind because they can't get any help."" Many self-medicate - he says - with drugs and alcohol.
All of a sudden, in the street outside the church, there's another tense moment. Women scream after a man collapses. ""He's OD'd. Help, he's overdosed outside."" 
Pastor Mick moves quickly. There's now quite a crowd gathered - with children circling on bikes. Two police community support officers are talking into their radios.
But Mick was the first on his hands and knees, talking to the unresponsive man and checking for a pulse. He rushes inside and asks Kev for the Naloxone, a medicine that rapidly reverses the effects of an opioid overdose - such as heroin.
By the time Mick gets back to the man - needle in hand - the panic is over. The emergency medication wasn't needed and the man is back on his feet. Nevertheless it was still a traumatic moment for Mick - and he becomes emotional. 
""People don't like to see [moments like] that but that's the reality of every city and every town in this country,"" he says. ""And I'm sorry if it offends people, but they're dying, and they can all be saved, every last one of them.""
Pastor Mick and his colleagues are proud with what they have achieved this year - but they also fear what the pandemic might yet bring in terms of mental health problems.
Health economist Dr Luke Munford - from the University of Manchester - says an alarm bell is ringing in many poorer areas of the UK. Urgent and emergency mental health referrals to crisis teams in East Lancashire almost quadrupled when you compare July 2019 to July 2021 - he told us - but the picture is ""similarly stark in other deprived parts of the country"".
The Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust says it's receiving £11.6m of NHS funding over three years to help improve community mental health services. 
Pastor Mick's transformation from violent drug dealer to lifesaver during a pandemic is profound - a personal redemption. ""To be able to serve people who are dying has become the biggest privilege of my life,"" he says. ""I feel the best I've ever felt in my life, I feel free. It's made me a better, stronger person - a softer, gentler person.""
NHS England told us they urge anyone who requires help with mental health to come forward.

28;The ultra-violent cult that became a global mafia;['2021-12-13T00:01:43.000Z'];['By Africa Eye'];['nigeria', 'long reads'];['cult', 'writes', 'global', 'turns', 'whipping', 'waiting', 'taken', 'thinking', 'ultraviolent', 'mafia', 'unconsciousness', 'stripped', 'rape', 'took'];"
A two-year BBC investigation into Black Axe - a Nigerian student fraternity which evolved into a dreaded mafia-group - has unearthed new evidence of  infiltration of politics, and a scamming and killing operation spanning the globe.  
Warning: Contains detailed graphic accounts of violence
During quiet moments, after he has finished lecturing for the day, Dr John Stone has flashbacks. It's not the blood or the sound of the gunshots that haunt him. It's the begging. The way people beg for mercy when they die. Begging him. Begging God.
""It's so painful,"" he says, shaking his head with a shudder. ""The families of the dead, they will curse you. A curse will be upon your life."" 
Dr Stone teaches political science at the University of Benin, in southern Nigeria. But for decades he was a senior member of Black Axe - a Nigerian mafia-style gang tied to human trafficking, internet fraud and murder. Locally, Black Axe are referred to as a ""cult,"" a nod to their secret initiation rituals and the intense loyalty of their members. They are also infamous for extreme violence. Images of those who cross their path - dead bodies mutilated or showing signs of torture - regularly surface on Nigerian social media. 
Dr Stone admits he took part in atrocities during his years as an ""Axeman"". At one point during our interview, recalling the most efficient means of killing, he leaned forward, squeezed his fingers into the shape of a gun and pushed them to the forehead of our producer. In Benin City, he was known as ""a butcher"". 
The horror of these years has scarred him. Today, Dr Stone is remorseful for his past and a vocal critic of the gang he once served. He is one of a dozen Black Axe sources who have decided to break their oaths of silence and reveal their secrets to the BBC, speaking to international media for the first time. 
For two years BBC Africa Eye has been investigating Black Axe, building a network of whistle-blowers, and uncovering several thousand secret documents - leaked from the gang's private communications. The findings suggest that over the past decade, Black Axe has become one of the most far-reaching and dangerous organised crime groups in the world. 
In Africa, Europe, Asia and North America, Axemen are in our midst. You may even have an email from them in your inbox.
Our investigation began with a death threat - a spidery, hand-written letter, delivered to a BBC journalist in 2018. It was dropped by a motorbike rider on to the windscreen of the reporter's car. Weeks earlier, the journalist had been digging into the illegal opioid trade in Nigeria and had met a number of Black Axe members face to face. Later, a second letter was handed to the man's family. Someone had been tracking him and had found his home.  
Did the threat come from Black Axe? How powerful is this crime network, and who is behind it?  
Our search for answers led us to a man who claimed he had hacked tens of thousands of secret Black Axe documents - a huge cache of private communications, from hundreds of suspected members. The messages, which span 2009 to 2019, include communications about murder and drug smuggling. Emails detail elaborate and lucrative internet fraud. Messages plan global expansion. It was a mosaic of Black Axe criminal activity spanning four continents. 
The source of the hack claims Black Axe are desperate to kill him. He would not reveal his real name, instead he used a pseudonym - Uche Tobias. 
""A manhunt will befall you,"" reads one death threat, sent to Tobias online. ""The AXE will pierce through your skull… I will lick your blood and chew your eyes.""
The BBC spent months analysing Tobias's documents. We were able to verify key sections of the data - confirming that individuals mentioned, and a number of the crimes committed in the documents, did take place. Much of the hacked material is too horrifying to publish. Axemen use secret forums - password-protected websites - to share photos of recent murders in internal chat groups. In one post labelled ""Hit"", a man lies splayed out on the floor of a small room. There are four gashes on his head. His white T-shirt is surrounded by a pool of his own blood. The imprint of a boot, stained red, marks his back. 
Within Nigeria, Black Axe is fighting a war of supremacy with rival ""cults"" - similar criminal gangs with names like the Eiye, the Buccaneers, the Pirates and the Maphites. Messages the BBC have translated from West African Pidgin show Axemen keeping track of how many rivals they have murdered, tallying up the figures like a football score in each region.
""Score is presently 15-2, the war is Benin,"" reads one post. ""Hit in Anambra state. Score is Aye [Axemen] 4 and Buccaneers 2,"" reads another.
But internet fraud, not murder, is the primary source of revenue for the gang. The documents given to the BBC include receipts, bank transfers and thousands of emails showing Black Axe members collaborating on online scams around the world. Members share ""formats"" - blueprints on how to conduct scams - with each other. Options include romance scams, inheritance scams, real estate scams and business email scams, in which the perpetrators create email accounts that appear to be those of the victim's lawyers, or accountants, in order to intercept payments. 
These scams are not small-scale, conducted by a lone wolf on a laptop. They are collaborative, organised and extremely lucrative operations, sometimes involving dozens of individuals working together across continents. 
Among the leaked emails, the BBC uncovered a case of a man in California who was targeted by a network of suspected Axemen in 2010, scamming him from Italy and Nigeria. The victim told us he was defrauded of $3m in total.  
""The Bank that I was working with does not seem to exist???"" the desperate victim exclaimed in an email to one of the conmen - the moment he realised his money was missing. ""Can I make this any clearer??? The Bank in Switzerland seems to be fraudulent.""
The emails show suspected Black Axe members adopting ""catcher"" names - fake names and identities - when scamming people, making use of forged or stolen passports. They refer to their victims as ""mugu"" or ""maye,"" regional slang words for ""idiots"".
Black Axe's international cybercrime network is likely to be generating billions of dollars in revenue for their members. In 2017 Canadian authorities say they busted a money laundering scheme linked to the gang worth more than $5bn. Nobody knows how many similar Black Axe schemes are out there. The leaked documents show members communicating between Nigeria, the UK, Malaysia, the Gulf States, and a dozen other countries.
""It's spread all over the world,"" the source of the data hack told us. He says he's an anti-fraud investigator in his private life and began pursuing Black Axe after encountering a number of their scam victims.
""I would estimate there are upwards of 30,000 members,"" he says.
Black Axe's global expansion has been carefully constructed. The correspondence shows Axemen dividing geographic areas into ""zones,"" and designating local ""heads"". Zonal heads collect ""dues"" - something akin to membership fees - from those in their jurisdictions, before sending the money back to leaders in their heartland in Nigeria's Benin City. 
""It has spread throughout Europe and America, South America and Asia,"" says Tobias. ""It is not a little club, this is a fantastically large criminal organisation.""
Tobias's assessment is backed up by international law enforcement findings. According to the 2021 Organised Crime Index, based on analysis from 120 experts in Africa, Nigeria has the highest levels of organised crime on the continent - and these networks are expanding abroad. 
In Italy, decades-old mafia laws are being revived to tackle the expansion of Black Axe, who are said to be overwhelming local crime networks. In April 2021, 30 suspected members were arrested in the country, charged with human trafficking, prostitution and internet fraud. 
The US has taken a more aggressive approach. FBI operations against Black Axe were launched in November 2019 and September 2021, eventually charging more than 35 individuals with multi-million dollar internet fraud. Between September and December this year, the US Secret Service and Interpol launched an international operation to arrest a further nine suspected Black Axe members in South Africa. 
""Cybercrime is a multi-trillion dollar industry, it's out of control,"" says Scott Augenbaum, a former FBI special agent and cyber-security expert.
He says he dealt with hundreds of Black Axe victims during his 30-year career in the bureau's cybercrime department, investigating fraud cases similar to those found in the leaked documents. 
""I've seen lives destroyed, companies go out of business, life savings lost,"" he said. ""It affects everyone.""
As global as Black Axe's criminal empire may be, its roots lie firmly in Nigeria. The group was founded 40 years ago in Benin City, Edo State.  
Most Axemen are from this region, and this affiliation may have played a role in the group's international expansion. According to the UN commissioner for refugees, 70% of Nigerians who migrate abroad are from Edo State. Black Axe are reported to play a pivotal role trafficking those who travel illegally, moving them between their bases in Benin City, North Africa and Southern Italy. 
In their homeland, male university undergraduates - aged between 16 and 23 - are Black Axe's primary recruits. The gang's secretive initiation process, known as ""bamming,"" is notoriously brutal.
""I didn't know I was going to bam that day,"" writes one Axeman, detailing his experience in a post on a secret forum from 2016. He says he was led away from campus, thinking he was attending an exclusive party. He writes how he was taken to a forest, where a group of men were waiting for him. They stripped him and forced him to lie face down in the mud. Then they took turns whipping his skin raw with bamboo, beating him close to unconsciousness. Someone screamed they would rape his girlfriend, and when he had finished, he would rape her again. 
""That was going to be the day I die,"" he writes.
But the agony eventually stopped. A series of rituals followed, including crawling through the legs of his tormentors - a tradition known as the ""devil's passage"" - before drinking blood from a cut in his thumb and chewing a kola nut, a caffeinated nut native to West Africa. To the echoes of songs and chants, he was then embraced by the men who had just tortured him. He had been reborn as what they call an ""Aye Axeman.""
There are many reasons people join Black Axe. Some recruits are forced, others volunteer. In Makoko, a vast slum built on wooden stilts above Lagos Lagoon, we interviewed a number of Axemen, some of whom said they had joined against their will. Their loyalty, nevertheless, was strong - cemented by the spiritual bond of the initiation process.   
""We worship Korofo, the unseen God, and he has always guided us,"" the leader of the group told us, sitting in a small wooden building, surrounded by an entourage of Axemen. He said he was ""proud"" to be a member of Black Axe, despite saying he was forcibly recruited by a police officer. Another member claimed he joined after his father was killed by a rival gang. No matter how or why members join, many of them claim there are benefits.
""Secrecy, discipline and brotherhood,"" a cult member told us proudly during another interview in Lagos in April 2021, when we asked why he had joined Black Axe. He claimed he made good money through the group's criminal enterprises - better than he would earn working in a bank. 
""Nobody will be able to touch you - once you belong to a cult, they will protect you,"" said Curtis Ogbebor, a community activist based in Benin City, who tries to stop young people joining groups like Black Axe. ""The process of initiation - it's all about networking."" 
Dr Stone says many Axemen join solely for networking purposes. Nigeria has the second highest rate of unemployment in the world, and within this challenging environment, he says joining Black Axe can provide protection and business connections. He claims not all members are criminals. 
""We have members in the Nigerian army, navy, air force. We have those in academia. We have priests, pastors,"" he said. 
This mutual support was key to Black Axe's original purpose. The group grew out of a student fraternity called the Neo Black Movement of Africa (NBM). It formed at the University of Benin in the 1970s. The NBM's symbol was a black axe breaking chains, and its founders said their aim was to fight oppression. The NBM was inspired by the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, but in structure, secrecy and brotherly commitment, it mirrored societies like the Freemasons, which had a presence in Nigeria during the colonial era. 
The NBM still exists today, and is a legally registered company with the Nigerian corporate affairs commission. It claims to have three million members around the world, and regularly publicises charitable activity - donations to orphanages, schools and the police, both in Nigeria and abroad. It holds huge annual conferences, some of which have been attended by prominent politicians and celebrities. 
Leaders of the NBM claim Black Axe is a rogue, breakaway group. Publicly they strongly disassociate themselves from the name and are adamant that the NBM opposes all criminal activity. 
""NBM is not Black Axe. NBM has nothing to do with criminality. NBM is an organisation that tends to promote greatness in the world,"" says Olorogun Ese Kakor, the current president of the organisation, in an interview with the BBC in July 2021. 
The NBM's lawyers told us anyone from Black Axe who is found to be a member of NBM ""will be expelled immediately"" and that they have zero tolerance for crime. 
International law enforcement have a different view. Statements by the US justice department, in the course of its prosecution of Black Axe members since 2018, say that the NBM is a ""criminal organisation"" and ""part of the Black Axe"". Similar statements have been made by authorities in Canada, who have said the NBM and Black Axe as ""the same"". 
The documents seen by the BBC also appear to show links between some Black Axe members and the NBM corporation. 
Many of the documents were sourced from an email account that belonged to Augustus Bemigho-Eyeoyibo, the president of the NBM between 2012 and 2016. These files suggest Mr Bemigho, a successful investor and hotelier in Nigeria, has engaged in large-scale internet fraud. The BBC verified two major cases from the data in which Mr Bemigho appears to have been involved in inheritance scams targeting UK and US citizens. The victims told us they were defrauded of more than $3.3m.
""We have removed him close to 1M dollar,"" says one message, referencing a victim, sent to Mr Bemigho by a suspected co-conspirator. The email contains the victim's full name, email address and number, and instructions on how to progress the scam.  
The documents suggest Mr Bemigho sent scam formats to a network of collaborators on at least 50 occasions. One message, discussing the expansion of the NBM, suggests he requested members establish NGOs around the world in order to ""rake in millions"".
When messaging NBM members in the emails, Mr Bemigho addresses them as ""Aye Axemen"". In one response, which appears to have been sent to Mr Bemigho via Facebook messenger, he is addressed as ""national elder Black Axe"".  
In 2019, Mr Bemigho's sister-in-law was charged with money laundering worth £1m in the UK. The Crown Prosecution Service, in a widely reported press release, referred to him as ""the leader of the Black Axe"" at the time.
When the BBC raised this evidence with the leadership of the NBM, they said they would investigate the matter, and that anyone found to be in breach of their code of conduct would be expelled. Mr Bemigho did not respond to the allegations when contacted by the BBC. 
Dr Stone claims Black Axe and the NBM - beneath the surface - are the same organisation. He is speaking from experience. He was not only a member of Black Axe, but also a chairman within the NBM in their heartland of Benin City. 
""It is one and the same,"" he says. ""It's just a kind of formality to cover the informalities. It's a coin with two sides."" 
According to Tobias, the NBM has been instrumental in Black Axe's covert expansion around the world. ""The Neo Black Movement as an organisation is just a charade, it's a smokescreen, it's a public face of the organisation,"" he says. He claims ""the end game"" of the NBM is ""to subvert the opinion of the public""- to hide ""what they really are, which is a mafia"".
Organisations operating under the name of the NBM are registered around the world, including in the UK and Canada. There are at least 50 Facebook, Instagram and YouTube accounts using a variation of this name, in addition to the corporation's official social media channels. Some accounts have more than 100,000 followers. Others include implicit references to Black Axe - axe emojis, photos of people carrying axes or guns, and occasionally the signature slogan ""Aye Axemen!""
The NBM has successfully established itself as a global brand, in multiple countries. In Nigeria, Dr Stone claims, the network's influence extends to the political sphere. 
""There are a lot of members in the House of Assembly, even the executive,"" he said. ""That is what Black Axe is. That is what NBM preaches: veer into any position that you know is humanly possible.""
Augustus Bemigho, the former head of the NBM - described in UK court files as the former head of Black Axe - ran for office in the Nigerian House of Representatives in 2019, campaigning for the ruling All Progressive Congress Party (APC). 
The activist Curtis Ogbebor claims Edo State politics is saturated with Black Axe members. ""Nigeria has this mafia politics,"" he said. ""Our politicians, government at all levels, encourage our youth into cultism.""
Prospective Nigerian politicians, Mr Ogbebor claims, hire Black Axe members to intimidate rivals, guard ballot boxes, and coerce people to vote. Once in office, he says, they then reward them with positions in government.
""They arm them, they give them money during elections, and they promise them political appointment,"" he says.
Two documents, which appear to have been leaked from the internal communications of the NBM, suggest that 35m naira (more than £64,000) was funnelled to the organisation in Benin City to ""protect votes"" and ensure support for a governorship election in 2012. In exchange for the support, the files state ""80 slots [were] allocated to NBM Benin Zone for immediate employment by the state government"". This money was allegedly distributed directly ""through the then Chief of Staff Hon. Sam Iredia"" - who has now died.
During interviews with senior members of the NBM in Lagos, their legal representative confirmed that ""a number of politicians"" are members. He went on to name the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu, as an example.
""There are a lot of people that are members of our organisation and there is nothing to hide about it,"" said Aliu Hope, one of the NBM's solicitors.  
A former member of the Edo State government, speaking to the international media for the first time, has come forward to blow the whistle on Edo State's collaboration with organised crime.
Tony Kabaka, a self-confessed ""cultist"" and member of the NBM, spent years working for the government in Benin, up until 2019. During this time, through his company Akugbe Ventures, he employed more than 7,000 tax collectors, generating billions in revenue for the state.
Since leaving politics, Mr Kabaka has faced repeated assassination attempts. His mansion, a huge white building with Roman columns, is littered with bullet holes.
""If you sat me down and say, 'Can you identify Black Axe in government?' I will identify,"" he says. ""Most politicians, almost everybody is involved.""
Mr Kabaka claims he was asked to mobilise cult groups to help win elections. He denies ever being involved in violence himself. 
""If government wants to seek for election they need them,"" he says. ""Cultism still exists because government is involved, and that is the truth.""
We travelled to Benin City in July 2021 to interview Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu, but he twice failed to turn up to the interview. When we sent the government of Edo State and Mr Shaibu our allegations that they have links to Black Axe, they did not respond. 
Dr Stone believes Nigerian law enforcement and politicians are too enmeshed with Black Axe to effectively combat them. The solution to the violence, he says, lies within the cult itself. He is not the only former member who feels the group have become too dangerous.
""The reason some of us joined NBM was to join in the fight of oppression,"" wrote one member of a secret forum leaked to the BBC. ""But now, we have been labelled a criminal organisation with evidence all over.""
Internal Black Axe communications are littered with similar complaints from members.  
""I didn't become an axeman to take lives, I became an axeman in the bid to fraternize,"" says another post. ""Please, stop these killings.""
The leaders of the NBM say they are committed to ensuring the organisation stays true to its founding principles and promotes peace. The group's current president, Olorogun Ese Kakor, told the BBC he was elected in order to root out criminal ""infiltrators"" and that these people are causing ""the organisation so much harm"". In a bid to harness this push for change, Dr Stone has formed what he calls a ""Rainbow Coalition"" - an advocacy group made up of former cultists, influential Nigerian citizens and professors. Members try to de-escalate tensions when rival gangs clash, and are trying to steer Black Axe towards a more peaceful future.  
""Rainbow's contribution to society is to reduce criminality,"" he says. ""To reduce the rate of death among youths. To reduce the rate of widows and orphans.""
Rainbow's co-founder, Chukwuka Omessah, wants Black Axe members to reflect on the society they are creating.
""Everyone has a conscience,"" he says. ""You may deny it on camera, deny it during public, but you cannot deny it in your quiet time - it will haunt you.""
Dr Stone knows that pushing Black Axe towards reform is a dangerous business. He knows his former comrades might come for him one day. He is ready for them if they do. The professor keeps a three feet-long sword hidden in his car, and a licensed shot gun at home. 
""For personal guard, personal safety,"" he says, with a half-smile. ""If they come after me, can't I also come after them?""

29;The world's first octopus farm - should it go ahead?;['2021-12-20T00:59:28.000Z'];['By Claire Marshall'];['spain', 'food', 'animal welfare', 'fish farming'];['thing', 'consumers', 'worlds', 'ahead', 'think', 'suffering', 'scarce', 'wild', 'farm', 'studies', 'states', 'octopus', 'wouldnt'];"
News that the world's first commercial octopus farm is closer to becoming reality has been met with dismay by scientists and conservationists. They argue such intelligent ""sentient"" creatures - considered able to feel pain and emotions - should never be commercially reared for food. 
Playing with a Giant Pacific Octopus is part of Stacey Tonkin's job. When she lifts the lid on the tank to feed the creature known as DJ - short for Davy Jones - he often scoots out from his cave to see her and stick his arms on the glass. That's if he's in a good mood. Octopuses live to be about four - so, at one year old, she says that he's the equivalent of a teenager.
""He definitely exhibits what you'd expect a teenager to be like - some days he's really grumpy and sleeps all day. Then other days he's really playful and active and wants to charge around his tank and show off."" 
Stacey is one of a team of five aquarists at Bristol Aquarium, and she sees DJ reacting differently to each of them. She says he will happily stay still, and hold her hand with his tentacles. 
The keepers feed the octopus with mussels and prawns and bits of fish and crab. Sometimes they put the food in a dog toy for him to tease out with his tentacles, so he can practise his hunting skills.
She says his colour changes with his moods. ""When he's an orangey brown, it's more like an active or playful kind of feeling. Speckly is more curious and interested. So he'll be swimming around orange and brown, then he'll come over and sit beside you and go all speckly and just look at you, which is quite amazing.
Stacey says the octopus shows his intelligence through his eyes. ""When you look at him, and he looks at you, you can sense there's something there.""
The level of awareness that Stacey witnesses first-hand is to be recognised in UK law through an amendment to the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill. 
The change has come after a team of experts sifted through more than 300 scientific studies and concluded that octopuses were ""sentient beings"" and there was ""strong scientific evidence"" that they could experience pleasure, excitement and joy - but also pain, distress and harm. 
The authors said they were ""convinced that high-welfare octopus farming was impossible"" and the government ""could consider a ban on imported farmed octopus"" in future. 
But octopus tentacles sizzle in pans, coil on plates and float in soups around the world - from Asia to the Mediterranean, and increasingly the USA. In South Korea, the creatures are sometimes eaten alive. The number of octopuses in the wild are decreasing and prices are going up. An estimated 350,000 tonnes are caught each year - more than 10 times the number caught in 1950. 
Against that background, the race to discover the secret to breeding the octopus in captivity has been going on for decades. It's difficult - the larvae only eat live food and need a carefully controlled environment. 
The Spanish multinational, Nueva Pescanova (NP) appears to have beaten companies in Mexico, Japan and Australia, to win the race. It has announced that it will start marketing farmed octopus next summer, to sell it in 2023.
The company built on research done by the Spanish Oceanographic Institute (Instituto Español de Oceanografía), looking at the breeding habits of the Common Octopus - Octopus vulgaris. NP's commercial farm will be based inland, close to the port of Las Palmas in the Canary Islands according to PortSEurope.
It's reported the farm will produce 3,000 tonnes of octopus per year. The company has been quoted as saying it will help to stop so many octopus being taken from the wild.
Nueva Pescanova has refused to reveal any details of what conditions the octopuses will be kept in, despite numerous approaches by the BBC. The size of the tanks, the food they will eat and how they will be killed are all secret. 
The plans have been denounced by an international group of researchers as ""ethically and ecologically unjustified"". The campaign group Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) has written to the governments of several countries - including Spain - urging them to ban it. 
Dr Elena Lara, CIWF's research manager, is angry. ""These animals are amazing animals. They are solitary, and very smart. So to put them in barren tanks with no cognitive stimulation, it's wrong for them.""
She says anyone who has watched the 2021 Oscar-winning documentary - My Octopus Teacher - will appreciate that.
Octopuses have large, complex brains. Their intelligence has been proven in numerous scientific experiments. They've been observed using coconut and sea shells to hide and defend themselves and have shown they can learn set tasks quickly. They've also managed to escape from aquariums  and steal from traps set by people fishing. 
What's more, they have no skeletons to protect them and are highly territorial. So they could be easily damaged in captivity and - if there was more than one octopus in a tank - experts say they could start to eat each other. 
If the octopus farm does open in Spain, it seems the creatures bred there would receive little protection under European law. Octopuses - and other invertebrate cephalopods - are considered as sentient beings, but EU law covering farm animal welfare is only applied to vertebrates - creatures that have backbones. Also, according to CIWF, there is currently no scientifically validated method for their humane slaughter.
Farming in the sea
Humans and octopuses had a common ancestor 560 million years ago, and evolutionary biologist Dr Jakob Vinther, from the University of Bristol, also has concerns.
""We have an example of an organism that has evolved to have an intelligence that is extremely comparable to ours."" Their problem-solving abilities, playfulness and curiosity are very similar to those of humans, says Dr Vinther - and yet they're otherworldly.
""This is potentially how it would look if we were ever going to meet an intelligent alien from a different planet.""  
Nueva Pescanova says on its website that it is ""firmly committed to aquaculture [farming seafood] as a method to reduce pressure on fishing grounds and ensure sustainable, safe, healthy, and controlled resources, complementing fishing"".
But CIWF's Dr Lara argues that NP's actions are purely commercial and the company's environmental argument is illogical. ""It doesn't mean that fishermen will stop fishing [octopuses].""
She argues that farming octopuses could add to the growing pressure on wild fish stocks. Octopuses are carnivores and need to eat two-to-three times their own weight in food to live. Currently around one-third of the fish caught around the planet is turned into feed for other animals - and roughly half of that amount goes into aquaculture. So farmed octopus could be fed on fish products from stocks already overfished.
Dr Lara is concerned consumers who want to do the right thing may think eating farmed octopus is better than octopus caught in the wild. ""It's not more ethical at all - the animal is going to be suffering its entire life,"" she says. And a 2019 report - led by associate professor of environmental studies at NYU, Jennifer Jacquet - argues that banning octopus farming wouldn't leave humans without enough to eat. It will mean ""only that affluent consumers will pay more for increasingly scarce, wild octopus,"" it states.
The whole debate is fraught with cultural complexities. 
Factory farming on land has evolved differently around the world. Pigs, for example, have been shown to be intelligent  - so what's the difference between a factory-farmed pig producing a bacon sandwich, and a factory-farmed octopus being put in the common Spanish dish Pulpo a la Gallega?
The conservationists argue the sentience of many farmed animals wasn't known when the intensive systems were set up, and the mistakes of the past shouldn't be repeated. 
Because pigs have been domesticated for many years, we have enough knowledge about their needs and know how to improve their lives, says Dr Lara. ""The problem with octopus is that they are completely wild, so we don't know exactly what they need, or how we can provide a better life for them.""
Given all we know about the intelligence of octopuses, and the fact they are not essential for food security, should an intelligent, complex creature start to be mass-produced for food?
""They are extremely complex beings,"" says Dr Vinther. ""I think as humans we need to respect that if we want to farm them or eat them.""

31;Blair becomes 'Sir Tony' and joins top royal order;['2021-12-31T22:29:15.000Z'];['By Sean Coughlan'];['uk royal family', 'tony blair', 'camilla, duchess of cornwall'];['order', 'thank', 'royal', 'service', 'honour', 'blair', 'tony', 'public', 'dedication', 'served', 'joins', 'immense', 'parts', 'politics', 'society', 'sir'];"
Tony Blair, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Baroness Amos are to be appointed as members of the Order of the Garter, England's oldest and most senior order of chivalry.
The former prime minister now becomes known as Sir Tony.
The appointments are the personal choice of the Queen, with up to 24 ""knight and lady companions"".
Baroness Amos, a former Labour cabinet minister, becomes the first black member of the order.
The ceremonial order, founded in 1348, is a recognition of significant public service, made as the personal gift of the monarch.
Mr Blair becomes Sir Tony from 1 January, as he joins the order as a ""knight companion"".
""It's an immense honour,"" he said. ""I would like to thank all those who served alongside me, in politics, public service and all parts of our society, for their dedication and commitment to our country.""
He says he will be ""Sir Tony"" rather than Sir Anthony,
There have been several fictional on-screen depictions of the relationship between the head of state and her former prime minister - but this might be seen as an act of personal recognition from the Queen. 
Baroness Amos becomes a ""lady companion"", honouring her career as international development secretary, a United Nations under-secretary for humanitarian affairs. and her current role - master of University College, Oxford.
She is the first black member appointed to the order in more than 700 years.
Baroness Amos, 67 and Tony Blair, 68, become two of the order's younger members, with most in their seventies, eighties and above, in a post held until death.
Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, is appointed as a ""royal companion"" - a move likely to be seen as showing the Queen's endorsement for Camilla's role as a senior member of the royal family and spouse of the future monarch.
The duchess has had an increasingly high profile with her own campaigns, such as warning against domestic violence.
With the new appointments there will now be 21 companions out of the maximum of 24. 
Another former prime minister, Sir John Major, is among the current members of the Order of the Garter, along with businessman and philanthropist Lord Sainsbury and former MI5 chief, Baroness Manningham-Buller.
Appointments are usually made in April, but they have been brought forward this year.
The order, instituted by Edward III in the 14th Century, was rooted in the idea of medieval chivalry and monarchs surrounded by their most senior aristocratic companions.
The modern criteria, according to Buckingham Palace, is to ""honour those who have undertaken public service, who have contributed in a particular way to national life or who have served the sovereign personally"".
The Queen takes part in an annual procession with members of the order at Windsor Castle, wearing velvet robes and plumed hats.
A banner of the heraldic arms of the knights are on display at St George's Chapel at the castle.
In Scotland there is the Order of the Thistle, instituted in 1687, with the most recent appointment made in 2018.

32;Victim Support: My daughter was murdered - sharing my grief helps others;['2022-01-01T00:56:06.000Z'];['By Harry Farley '];['policing', 'murder of bibaa henry and nicole smallman', 'metropolitan police service', 'london violence', 'lancashire constabulary'];['period', 'grief', 'daughter', 'support', 'murdered', 'pandemic', 'longer', 'victim', 'sharing', 'victims', 'helps', 'ending', 'crime', 'wanting', 'impact'];"
Mina Smallman's daughters, Bibaa Smallman and Nicole Henry, were murdered in north London. As part of her role as a guest editor of BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she is focusing on the work of the charity Victim Support, which has a team of volunteers helping victims of crime. 
""Every time I drive past her house I can see her in the window. Sometimes I'll wave, which sounds a bit crazy,"" says Victim Support volunteer Julie Doherty, who knows first-hand the pain of losing a loved one to domestic violence. 
Julie's daughter, Leanne Collopy, was murdered in 2017. Leanne was 25 when her ex-partner stabbed her and set her home on fire while she was inside with their two-year-old daughter, Leila, who survived thanks to her mother's quick thinking. 
Saleem Said was jailed for life - but like others who have lost loved ones to homicide, Julie was left to cope with the trauma.
""I can't explain how it changed life for me and my family. I lost a daughter, very suddenly, very violently,"" Julie says.""It could be simple things like a song comes on the radio, or a smell. Straight away you get that physical pain in your chest, you're back in that moment of absolute despair and devastation. 
""This could be a year down the line. I'm four-and-a-half years down the line and I still experience moments like that. You learn to deal with it. You don't get over it. You don't move on. You just learn to deal with it.""
Julie says she has joined ""a club that you don't want to belong to"" - people who have lost loved ones to homicide.
New figures from Victim Support, seen by the BBC, suggest a rise of nearly 20% in its caseload, compared with before the pandemic. The charity's figures show cases involving violence with injury have gone up by 20%, domestic abuse cases are up 27%, and hate crime cases are up 6%.
Over the same period, domestic burglary was down 8% and theft offences were down 18%, says Victim Support.  Meanwhile, the most recent Office of National Statistics figures, for the year ending in June, suggest that if you exclude fraud and computer misuse, there was a 14% decrease in total crime in the year ending June 2021.Diana Fawcett, chief executive of Victim Support, says the upsurge it is experiencing is due to the length of time that people need support, rather than higher case numbers.  The impact of crime has been ""exacerbated as people spend more time isolated at home, and in some cases have difficulty in accessing other services due to Covid-19,"" she told the BBC.  ""Victims are also receiving support for longer. Our homicide service is supporting more bereaved victims now than before the pandemic, with people wanting support for a longer period of time, as they deal with the impact of the pandemic as well as the pain of bereavement.""
For Julie, like so many who have suffered loss, Christmas is particularly hard, as a time traditionally spent with family: ""Leanne is now only present by her absence, by the empty chair at the table that's never going to be filled. I've got two other daughters and if I have a picture with my other daughters, there's always somebody missing.""
Julie volunteers as a peer support worker with the charity, which means she mentors and counsels others who have gone through similar experiences. She describes it as a ""two-way thing"", where she can both give and receive help. ""I don't know where I'd be without peer support.""
Leanne was awarded a commendation for bravery from the Queen for saving her daughter. With her home on fire and having been stabbed multiple times, Leanne still had the presence of mind to put Leila in the sink, run the tap and open a window. 
It was there the child was found by the first police officer on the scene. Leanne died in hospital four days later. Julie rarely speaks of what happened, but finds sharing her story with other victims can help.
""It is very comforting to speak to somebody who's been through the same thing, that's in the same situation as you are. I think unless you've been in this situation, you can't fully understand the entirety of the depths of your feelings."" Julie has custody of Leila, who's now six: ""It is redeeming... Some days I feel like I've got Leanne here, back as a little girl again - her mannerisms, or she'll say something or just do something like give me a look and I'll think: 'Goodness me, that's Leanne all over again'. ""She's been my reason for getting out of bed.""

33;"ARFID: 'My son's not a picky eater; he's scared of food'";['2022-01-01T00:56:27.000Z'];['By David Pittam & Charlie Jones'];['eating disorders', 'hitchin', 'child health', 'narborough'];['sons', 'hes', 'arfid', 'tried', 'refusal', 'foods', 'range', 'eater', 'help', 'usually', 'given', 'need', 'wider', 'scared', 'food', 'picky', 'parents'];"
Crisps, dry crackers and plain pasta may not be the most exciting foods but they are often the staples relied upon by children with a little-known eating disorder.
Nine-year-old Otto from Hitchin, in Hertfordshire, has the condition ARFID, which stands for avoidant restrictive food intake disorder, meaning he avoids many different foods.
Otto says he would like to try new things, but often feels scared.
""It sometimes feels like food is inedible,"" he says.
""I feel like I'm either going to gag or throw up. I'm not familiar with the taste and that just makes my body feel like 'oh my gosh, this isn't like something you've had before...what is it? what is it?'.
""Then my body tries to get rid of it, which makes me gag.""
Otto mainly lives on a diet of plain pasta, alongside a handful of other foods.
His lunch box contains items from the baby aisle, like fruit pouches and baby rice crackers. 
Otto was diagnosed with an oral developmental delay at 18 months old and referred to the food and eating disorder clinic at Great Ormond Street Hospital, which he attended for a year before being discharged.
His mother Charlotte says the family has always struggled to access support from local services.
""As a parent, to go through this and watch your child struggle so much with food, the overriding feeling is one of isolation. I felt like no one else had this issue,"" she says.
""The worst times have been on holiday, going to a café and realising there was nothing he would eat and judgement from other parents who think he is just a fussy eater and that we are giving in to him.
""We're the ones on the frontline who manage this every day.
""I feel like we are still on our own, all these years later.""

The eating disorder hit the headlines last month after the BBC spoke to a mother from Narborough, Leicestershire, who was desperate to find a specific brand of crisps amid a national shortage.
Michelle's four-year-old daughter Ava, who also has ARFID, will only eat Walkers oven baked sea salt-flavour crisps and a few other foods.
""It's horrible,"" says Michelle. ""People think you are a bad parent when you're trying really, really hard.""
Michelle is part of a support group for parents of children with the condition.
""Some [parents] have faced judgement from family members,"" she says.
""They don't dare speak out or ask for help.""

Melissa, the mother of seven-year-old Ruby, says ARFID is one of the hardest things to face as a parent.
Her daughter was diagnosed three years ago after she suddenly stopped eating lots of foods.
She now only eats children's yoghurt, fromage frais and will sometimes nibble on a Babybel.
""We thought at first it might be a fussy stage, like children have, but it escalated into a problem,"" says Melissa, from Gloucestershire.
""Within three weeks she lost a kilogram of weight. It was terrifying.
""I could see her fading before my eyes.""
Since her diagnosis, Ruby's diet has been bolstered by vitamin supplements and she is receiving therapy for the condition.
""It's not picky eating,"" says Melissa.
""It's a mental health disorder. And it's a nightmare for people going through it.""
The condition can also affect older children and adults.
Ever since she was a child, Liz Morris, 59, has had a limited diet.
Today, she can only bear to eat a small handful of foods, including cereal, oxtail soup and eggs.
""I have no memory of ever eating anything other than the foods I still eat today,"" she says.
Liz, from Dorset, has not had a formal diagnosis but she says she and her doctor believe she has ARFID.
""I've spent my life being told there's something wrong with me, that it's just a case of will power and I was being weak,"" she says.
""For me, [food] has always been a battleground. It has affected my relationships, my work, my health.
""The more people who know there are people out there who struggle with this, the better.""
Some health professionals are calling for more recognition of the condition.
ARFID is recognised by the NHS and was introduced as a new diagnosis in 2013.
Dr Claire Higgins, principal clinical psychologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital, suggests ARFID awareness could be built into the training of health visitors and GPs.
Around a third of the children she sees have a history of reflux or allergies as a baby which made them start to associate eating with pain.
""We don't appreciate what a sensory experience eating is,"" she says.
""It can feel quite overwhelming for these children.""
She believes in a range of approaches to help children with the disorder.
""We often talk about messy food play, getting them involved with cooking but with no expectation to try the food,"" she says.
""Increasing their exposure to different foods helps them grow in confidence and they may be able to later move on to touching the food and maybe trying it.""
Gillian Harris, a psychologist at the University of Birmingham, says that while there have not been any studies on the prevalence of ARFID, from her experience about one in 500 children are affected.
She says it usually develops in children by the age of four and is caused by hypersensitivity, often starting in the mouth.
It makes some foods seem genuinely repulsive, she adds, particularly food which needs to be chewed at the more sensitive sides of the mouth.
""There is a fussy stage that all children go through at around two years,"" she says.
""That's a stage that children with ARFID go into and do not come out of.""
Everyone is on a spectrum of food acceptance and refusal, she believes, but she would class it as a condition when the diet is limited to 20 items or less.
""Many parents are blamed for their children's food refusal and therefore not given the help that they need, but they have usually tried everything they can to get their child to eat a wider range of foods,"" she says.
""[But] I think there is a wider understanding now that this is a real eating disorder, not just a naughty child or bad parenting.""
Nicole Kirkland started the charity ARFID Awareness UK in 2019 after realising there was a lack of support for parents of children with the disorder.
She herself has a six-year-old daughter who has never had a hot meal.
""There is no standard of care, there are no guidelines for GPs to work from, so of course many of them have no knowledge of ARFID,"" she says.
The charity is inundated with emails from parents and healthcare professionals asking for advice on a daily basis, she says.
""I just hope that in the future ARFID will be more well-known and we will have a clear pathway to help people because it affects so many more children and adults than we realise,"" she says.

34;The mystery of the home where the Queen was born;['2021-12-29T00:12:18.000Z'];['By Sean Coughlan'];['uk royal family', 'the royal family and the media', 'queen elizabeth ii'];['street', 'born', 'mystery', 'restaurant', 'individual', 'reception', 'theres', 'queen', 'stretch', 'row', 'office', 'block', 'private'];"
Where exactly was the site of the house where the Queen was born? Have visitors been looking in the wrong place? And are the claims that the house was damaged in the Blitz correct?
The Queen was born on 21 April 1926 at 17, Bruton Street in Mayfair, London. Not a palace or a big estate or even a hospital, but a townhouse on a busy London street.
Her parents had moved into the house, belonging to her Scottish grandparents, the Earl and Countess of Strathmore, only a few weeks before her birth.
""It's a reminder of how the royal family was not as flush in those days. Money was an issue,"" says royal historian Robert Lacey.
Bear in mind, the Queen was not born to be Queen - at this point, as the daughter of the King's younger son, she was not expected to take the throne.
The Queen's first home no longer stands - and there are persistent claims online it was a casualty of air raids during World War Two.
""The house was damaged in the Blitz and later demolished,"" says Wikipedia, as one example of many.
But armfuls of documents in the British Library and other archives show that the 18th Century house was gone before the war had even started.
It was property developers - much more relentless than air raids - that finished off the Queen's first home.
In 1937, a man in a top hat and frock coat had formally begun the demolition of 17, Bruton Street and many of its neighbouring buildings stretching around the corner into Berkeley Square.
There had been plans to build a hotel for the Canadian Pacific Railway, but the site was eventually cleared for a big office and retail complex.
These were unsentimental times about architectural heritage. Without a glimmer of regret, demolition gangs flattened what was described by one report at the time as ""20 of the most historic houses in London"".
A poignant drawing by the war artist Sir Muirhead Bone recorded workmen pulling down the facades of the elegant old buildings.
If there was any further doubt, a surveyor's note from May 1939, in the London Metropolitan Archive, closed the file on the original 17, Bruton Street with a confirmation that the old house had been demolished and ""its site  forms part of that upon which Berkeley Square House has been built"".
Astrea, the firm currently running the Berkeley Square House site, says a new building on the site was occupied by the air ministry, in the run-up to WW2.
But there's another frequently repeated claim about the Queen's birthplace - that the site is now a Chinese restaurant.
This, again, is not the full story.
The Hakkasan restaurant has the same 17, Bruton Street address. But so does a stretch of boarded-up office in the same block. There's also a glass-fronted, corporate entrance and reception area next door. All of this extended business block is built over what, in the 1920s, would have been a row of individual, private houses.
It might not be such a romantic story, but it's the rather anonymous corporate entrance that seems closest to the site of the original 17, Bruton Street: a side entrance into some offices in Berkeley Square House.
In the London Metropolitan Archive in Clerkenwell, there are bundles of old files and architects' drawings, with art deco lettering, showing the layout of the original house.
They show the lost house would have been around this entrance area, with the frontage stretching down towards what is now a car showroom selling Bugattis and Bentleys.
This is confirmed by Westminster City Council whose planners say this can be plotted against the boundary lines of original properties on the other side of the street.
One end of the restaurant would have overlapped with the original house, and Hakkasan general manager Sharon Wightman says the royal connection is a ""brilliantly interesting talking point, which goes down well with our guests"".
But much of the Queen's old home is now replaced by the corporate glass of the entrance next door.
There are two plaques on an adjacent wall marking the birthplace, including one from Westminster Council. These have been moved as the buildings have been altered and are at one end of the original site.
There's no official blue plaque because a spokeswoman for English Heritage says they have to be on original buildings - and, also, they don't put up plaques for living people.
Toby Cuthbertson, from Westminster's planning department, says this would have been a high-class, ""first-rate"" London property, five bays wide - but the very wealthy would have been another step up, in the type of houses that had names, rather than numbers.
When the Queen was born here in 1926, her royal grandparents came to see her on that first day. Queen Mary recorded in her diary that her grand-daughter was ""a little darling, with a lovely complexion and pretty fair hair"".
It's also where the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks hurried, as it was then still protocol that the home secretary was present for such a royal birth. He was considered such an authoritarian, he was nicknamed ""Mussolini minor"".
This was the house where the Queen's mother, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, had set out in April 1923 for her wedding to her shy suitor, the then Duke of York. They returned here for the birth of their first child almost exactly three years later.
The house was also in walking distance of the Harley Street practice of speech therapist Lionel Logue who, from 1926, helped the future King overcome his stammer. 
This would have been a Mayfair of upper-class parties and fashionable gatherings.
But it was also a politically volatile and divided time. The general strike was called only a few weeks after the Queen's birth and her grandfather, George V, had cautioned: ""Try living on their wages before you judge them.""
The Queen and her parents moved later that year to a bigger house in Piccadilly.
There were subsequent plans to convert the house in Bruton Street into offices, with architects' drawings showing how the rooms, including where the Queen was born, would have been panelled, partitioned and redesigned for office workers.
""The room on the first floor, in which the little princess was born, is one of the least ornate of all the rooms, but also one of the sunniest,"" read a newspaper account at the time.
But the house was later demolished - and remains a curiously low-key site for such an historic place. There can't have been many private houses in London which were the family home for a future King and two Queens - yet it's barely on the tourist trail.
""I think it reflects the general modesty of the Queen,"" says historian Robert Lacey. ""She doesn't blow her own trumpet.""
The site is still part of a royal estate, but, these days, it belongs to the estate of the royal family of Abu Dhabi - part of a portfolio of property in this part of London said to be worth £5bn.
The original 17, Bruton Street was managed in the early 1930s by Howard Frank, co-founder of the Knight Frank estate agency. 
Simon Burgoyne, now working for Knight Frank on property in modern Mayfair, says this fashionable area was, at the time, where landed families - with estates in the country - had their London townhouses.
""But after the war, no one could afford to keep these big, old, rambling buildings, so a lot of them were turned into offices,"" he says.
This has now come full circle, says Mr Burgoyne, with offices being turned back into luxury residential property. If the house had survived, it would have been worth well over £25m, he says, and possibly as much as £100m.
But the house was flattened in 1937 - and, in another unexpected turn, by then the young Elizabeth and her parents had moved into Buckingham Palace.
The abdication crisis of 1936 had seen her father take the throne as George VI, following his brother Edward VIII's planned marriage to an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson.
Mrs Simpson had been followed by Special Branch officers during this political maelstrom and they had noted claims that she had had an affair with a car salesman called Guy Marcus Trundle.
In a final twist, the address where they found this ""charming adventurer"" was 18, Bruton Street, now, appropriately, part of the Bentley dealership.

35;Three ways to be more rational this year;['2022-01-01T00:54:51.000Z'];['By Professor Steven Pinker'];['psychology'];['woven', 'winter', 'warning', 'reward', 'rational', 'ways', 'prefers', 'theres', 'self', 'struggle', 'working', 'summer'];"
Many people use the New Year to turn over a new leaf - to act in a way that is more rational and in our better interests. Yet we all have to confess this is more difficult than it might seem. 
Here are three examples from my series - Think with Pinker - of common irrationality traps and how to avoid them. 
When people contrast what they are ""thinking"" with what they are ""feeling"", often what they have in mind is the difference between immediate and longer-term enjoyment. For example - a feast now and a slim body tomorrow; a trinket today and sufficient funds when the rent is due; a night of passion and the facts of life nine months later. 
This contrast between times can feel like a struggle between selves, as if we have one self who enjoys a streaming TV series and another who enjoys good grades in an exam. 
In one episode of The Simpsons, Marge warns her husband he will regret his conduct, and he replies, ""That's a problem for Future Homer. Man, I don't envy that guy."" This raises a question: should we sacrifice now to benefit our future selves?
Steven Pinker is Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, the author of Rationality: What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce, Why It Matters and the host of the BBC 4 series Think with Pinker
The answer is - not necessarily. ""Discounting the future"", as economists call it, is rational to a degree. It's why we insist on bank interest to compensate us for giving up cash now in exchange for cash later. After all, maybe we'll die and our sacrifice will have been for nothing. As the bumper sticker advises, ""Life is short. Eat dessert first.""
Maybe the promised payoff will never arrive, like when a pension fund goes bust. And after all, you're only young once. It makes no sense to save up for decades to buy an expensive sound system at an age when you can no longer hear the difference.
So our problem is not that we discount the future, but that we discount it too steeply. We eat, drink and make merry as if we'll be dead in only a few years. And we discount the future myopically. We know at some point we should start saving for a rainy day, but the money we have now burns a hole in our pocket.
The struggle between a self who prefers a small reward now and a self who prefers a larger reward later, is woven into the human condition. It's long been played out in art and myth. There's the biblical story of Eve eating the apple despite God's warning that she and Adam will be exiled from Paradise if she does - and then the grasshopper of Aesop's fable, who sings his summer away while the ant is working to store food, and finds himself hungry in winter.
But mythology has also acted out a famous strategy of self-control. Odysseus had himself tied to the mast so he could not be lured into steering his ship on to the rocks by the Sirens' alluring song. That is, our present self can outsmart a future self by restricting its options. 
When sated, we can throw out the chocolate so that when we're hungry there's nothing to binge on. When we take a job, we authorise our employers to tithe some of our salary for retirement so there's no surplus to blow at the end of the month.
It's one way we can use reason to overcome temptation, without relying on the raw exertion of willpower - which is all too easily outmatched in the moment.
Hamlet was not the only sky-gazer to see things in ""yonder clouds"" - it's a pastime of our species. We look for patterns in the kaleidoscope of experience because they may be signs of a hidden cause or agent. But this leaves us vulnerable to hallucinating spurious causes in haphazard noise.
When events occur at random times, they will inevitably group in clusters in our minds - unless there is some non-random process that spaces them apart. And so when we experience haphazardly timed events in life, we're liable to think that bad things happen in threes, that some people are born under a bad sign, or that God is testing our faith.
The danger lies in the very idea of ""randomness"" - which actually is two ideas. 
Randomness can refer to an anarchic process which throws up data without rhyme or reason - like the roll of a die or flip of a coin. But it can also refer to the data themselves when they defy simple summary.
For example - ""heads, tails, tails, heads, tails, heads"" looks random, while ""heads, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails"" does not because the second can be compressed into ""three heads, three tails"".
People judge the second run to be less likely, even though every sequence of flips is equally probable. They may even bet that after a long string of heads, the coin is due for tails, as if it had a memory and a wish to appear fair - the infamous gambler's fallacy.
What we often fail to appreciate is that a random process can generate non-random-looking data. Indeed, it's guaranteed to do so in the fullness of time. We're impressed by coincidences because we forget how many ways there are for coincidences to occur.
For example, you're at a party with two dozen guests - what is the chance that two share a birthday? 
The answer is ""better than 50-50"". And with 60 guests, it's 99%! 
The high odds surprise us because we know it's unlikely that a random guest will share our own birthday, or any other birthday. What we forget is how many birthdays there are - 366 in some years - and thus how many opportunities there are for coincidences.
Life is saturated with these opportunities. Perhaps the licence plate of the car in front of me spells part of my phone number backwards. Perhaps a dream or foreboding comes true - after all, billions of them float through people's minds every day.
The danger of over-interpreting coincidences explodes when we single them out after the fact - like the psychic who crows about a correct prediction cherry-picked from a long list of blunders he hopes everyone's forgotten. It's called the Texas sharpshooter fallacy - referring to the marksman who shoots a bullet into a barn wall and then paints a circular target around the hole to make it look like he is a crack shot. 
Spotting patterns is especially seductive when we choose the pattern only after we've gazed at it - when we get to say, like Hamlet with his clouds, whether it's a weasel or a camel or a whale. 
Over-interpreting randomness is an occupational hazard when monitoring the random walk of financial markets, while resisting any temptation provides an opportunity for the cognitively savvy investor. It also provides an opportunity in living one's life - to avoid thinking everything happens for a reason and to avoid guiding your personal choices by reasons that don't exist.
Whenever we engage in an intellectual discussion, our goal ought to be to converge on the truth. But humans are primates - and often the goal is to become the alpha debater. 
It can be done non-verbally - the supercilious posture, the hard stare, the deep voice, the peremptory tone, the constant interruptions and other dominance displays.
Dominance can also be pursued in the content of an argument, using a host of dirty tricks designed to make an opponent look weak or foolish. These can include:
Intellectual combat, to be sure, can be a titillating spectator sport. Readers of literary magazines savour the withering ripostes between intellectual gladiators. A popular genre of YouTube video features the hero who ""destroys"" or ""owns"" or ""takes down"" a hapless questioner (note the metaphors).
But if the point of debate is to clarify our understanding - rather than bow to an alpha - we ought to find ways to control these bad habits.
We can all promote reason by changing the mores of intellectual discussion, so people treat their beliefs as hypotheses to be tested rather than slogans to be defended.

36;South Africa prepares to bury Archbishop Desmond Tutu;['2022-01-01T06:06:09.000Z'];['BBC News'];['apartheid', 'desmond tutu', 'south africa'];['way', 'mix', 'expressed', 'prepares', 'term', 'archbishop', 'desmond', 'bury', 'south', 'regret', 'rainbow', 'ethnic', 'nation', 'postapartheid', 'tutu', 'africa'];"
The funeral mass for South African anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu is set to take place on Saturday morning in Cape Town.
Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who helped end the racist regime in South Africa, died last Sunday aged 90. 
His death prompted an outpouring of grief among South Africans. 
Thousands have paid their respects at St George's Cathedral where his body has been lying in state in a simple casket.
Tutu was one of the driving forces behind the movement to end the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991.  
He will be given an official state funeral with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa expected to deliver the main eulogy. 
Tutu had insisted there should be ""no ostentatiousness or lavish spending"" on the ceremony and that he be given ""the cheapest available coffin"". 
He also said the only flowers in the cathedral should be a ""bouquet of carnations from his family"", according to the Archbishop Tutu IP Trust and the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation.
His ashes are to be interred behind the pulpit at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town - the Anglican diocese he served as Archbishop for 35 years.
It was earlier revealed that Tutu is to be aquamated - a process using water that is described as an environmentally friendly alternative to cremation. 
Many people in Cape Town turned up to file past the archbishop's coffin as it lay in state. 
One man, Wally Mdluli, hitchhiked more than 1,000km (620 miles) across the country from Bloemfontein to Cape Town - enlisting the help of family and friends to pay for some of the trip and even sleeping at a petrol station on the way.
""I feel fulfilled after I saw the coffin. It's like his spirit is in me,"" he told the BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Cape Town.

Tutu used his high-profile to speak out against oppression of black people in his home country, always saying his motives were religious and not political. 
After Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994, Tutu was appointed by him to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate crimes committed by both whites and blacks during the apartheid era.
Tutu was awarded the Nobel prize in 1984 for his role in the struggle to abolish the apartheid system.
He was also credited with coining the term Rainbow Nation to describe the ethnic mix of post-apartheid South Africa, but in his latter years he expressed regret that the nation had not coalesced in the way in which he had dreamt.

37;Kim Jong-un: North Korea to focus on economy in 2022;['2022-01-01T07:40:25.000Z'];['BBC News'];['kim jong-un', 'north korea'];['speech', 'north', 'researcher', 'senior', 'replacement', 'jongun', 'report', 'kim', 'seongchang', 'relations', 'focus', '2022', 'shortest', 'economy', 'told', 'korea', 'sejong'];"
North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has said the faltering economy will be the national priority this year as the country faces a ""great life-and-death struggle"". 
He was speaking at the end of a key ruling party meeting, which coincides with him being in power for 10 years. 
A self-imposed coronavirus blockade has left North Korea struggling with food shortages. 
There was no direct mention of the US or South Korea in his speech. 
Mr Kim said increasing development and improving people's living standards was the main task. 
He acknowledged the ""harsh situation"" in 2021 and and set ""an important task for making radical progress in solving the food, clothing and housing problem for the people"", the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.
He said battling the pandemic was one of the main goals for the coming year: ""Emergency epidemic prevention work should be made a top priority in the state work,"" he is quoted as saying by KCNA.
But he also said Pyongyang would continue to strengthen its defence capabilities because of an increasingly unstable military environment on the Korean peninsula.
He was speaking on Friday at the end of the 4th Plenary Meeting of the 8th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), which began on Monday.
There were reports earlier this year that people in the country were going hungry, giving rise to concerns as winter approached about a full-blown food crisis.
The border has been closed since January 2020 to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from China.
Following a year in which leader Kim Jong-un repeatedly stressed North Korea's dire economic condition and food shortages, these challenges were once again in the spotlight at the ruling Workers' Party's year-end plenum.
Kim's warning of a ""great life-or-death struggle"" in 2022 echoes last April's rhetoric urging officials to prepare for another ""Arduous March"", referencing North Korea's greatest economic crisis and famine in the 1990s.
While such comparisons overexaggerate the situation, North Korea's economic woes have indeed been exacerbated by Covid-19-related border closures, international sanctions and natural disasters.
These have all contributed to what Kim described in June as a ""tense"" food situation, and international agencies also warn of growing food insecurity and starvation.
Kim's emphasis on implementation of the national economic plan, rural development and advancing ""scientific farming"" now serves to remind citizens that their leader is prioritising their needs, while setting expectations for another year of economic struggles.       
Mr Kim's new year speeches have previously included messages to South Korea and the US, but there were no explicit mentions this time.
""If we consider this report on the plenum as a replacement of Kim Jong-un's annual New Year's speech, it can be said that it's by far the shortest mention of inter-Korean relations and foreign policy ever,"" Cheong Seong-chang, a senior researcher at Sejong Institute, told NK News.
At the end of last year, North and South Korea, the US, and China agreed in principle to declare a formal end to the Korean War which ended in an armistice.
But talks have yet to begin because of North Korea's demands, South Korea has said.

38;India: At least 12 dead in New Year temple stampede;['2022-01-01T06:42:00.000Z'];['BBC News'];['india'];['dead', 'site', 'eyewitnesses', 'hours', 'india', 'temple', 'crowds', 'morning', '12', 'stampede', 'managed', 'early', 'clear', 'properly'];"
At least 12 people were killed and several others injured after a stampede at a religious shrine in India.
Pilgrims were visiting the shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi in Indian-administered Kashmir on Saturday when the tragedy unfolded. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was ""saddened"" by the loss of life. 
Tens of thousands of people usually visit the shrine every day, and it is thought there was a peak in visitors because of the holiday season.
According to a senior police officer, 14 people were injured in the stampede, with all of them taken to hospital.
One senior government official told AFP news agency that the death toll could rise as the shrine was incredibly busy with people trying to visit for the New Year. 
The shrine, located near the town of Katra, is among India's most revered pilgrimage sites. Visitor numbers have been capped to around 25,000 because of the pandemic.
It is not yet clear caused the stampede in the early hours of the morning, but some eyewitnesses claimed crowds at the site were not being managed properly.
An investigation into the incident has been launched. 
In a tweet, Mr Modi said: ""Extremely saddened by the loss of lives due to a stampede at Mata Vaishno Devi Bhawan. May the injured recover soon.""

39;After Desmond Tutu, a time for new South African heroes;['2022-01-01T07:14:21.000Z'];['By Andrew Harding'];['desmond tutu', 'south africa'];['heroes', 'truth', 'television', 'african', 'townships', 'desmond', 'torture', 'trauma', 'south', 'watched', 'trc', 'urging', 'winning', 'tutu'];"
Archbishop Desmond Tutu was the last truly global figure from an era when South Africa taught the world what courage and reconciliation could achieve. 
The last of an extraordinary generation of moral giants - of men and women who, in the 1980s and 1990s, steered a turbulent, traumatised country away from cruelties of racial apartheid and the cliff-edge of civil war.
With Desmond Tutu gone, South Africa finds itself not quite rudderless or leaderless, but fully untethered, at last, from the years of its greatness. 
The contrast between those times of sacrifice and glory, and today's far shabbier political realities can certainly appear stark. 
The country Tutu finally leaves behind is a troubled one, gripped by deep economic malaise, by chokingly high unemployment and enduring inequality, and governed by a former liberation party, the African National Congress (ANC), which is at open war with itself. 
Tutu was too frail to comment on the political violence that erupted in July this year - as supporters of the disgraced former President Jacob Zuma responded to his imprisonment for contempt of court by orchestrating an attempted insurrection. 
But the Archbishop had, for years, made clear his growing disillusionment with the ANC and its slide into factionalism and corruption. Those close to him spoke of his deepening concern that so many of the hard-won achievements of liberation were being squandered.
Disappointment is, perhaps inevitably, the price one pays for longevity.
Not surprisingly, some prominent figures in the ANC have chosen to stay silent in recent days, rather than joining those offering sometimes hypocritical tributes to a man who spent so much time berating them as ""worse than the apartheid government"" - a man some of them chose to ignore or insult, or simply told to ""shut up"".
But this week, others have chosen to hit back and to attack Tutu - on social media, in particular, of course - as some sort of ""sell-out,"" as a man who prioritised reconciliation over justice, the sensibilities of white people over the needs of the black majority. The accusation is not new. But it is worth noting. 
For years, some politicians here have sought to exploit the frustrations of impoverished South Africans - those who have gained the least from democracy and years of economic stagnation - by accusing Tutu and also Nelson Mandela of being too quick to compromise with apartheid's leaders and business magnates. 
They accuse the two men of enabling white South Africans to keep hold off their ill-gotten wealth, and apartheid's death squads to enjoy comfortable retirements.
In short, they have accused Tutu of over-selling the idea of a ""rainbow nation"" - the phrase he coined and championed.
The allegation is widely contested and debated here in South Africa. 
But it touches on something very specific to both Tutu and Mandela as leaders - on their astonishing capacity, vital in those tense and desperate years before and during the fall of apartheid, to bring people together and to achieve international appeal. Mandela depended on a certain easy grandeur, sprinkled with wit. 
Tutu's appeal relied on a more raucous form of humour, balanced by his readiness to show vulnerability and deep emotion.
He would mock apartheid's leaders, urging them to join ""the winning side, before it's too late,"" and drawing laughter from angry crowds in South Africa's embattled black townships. And Tutu would cry publicly, in the mid-1990s, at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) which he led, channelling the grief and trauma of millions of people who watched on television as the daily revelations of torture and abuse suffered at the hands of apartheid security forces emerged. 
The TRC was imperfect - and contested by many in the ANC, including Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who was found to have committed terrible crimes and felt she was unfairly equated with her oppressors as a result. But it was part of a healing process considered vital at the time and would have been impossible without Tutu's presence.
Put simply, what Tutu and Mandela had, in abundance, was charm. And, channelled in different ways, that charm was vital to South Africa's journey and to its successes. As were the compromises made during the tortuous negotiations that enabled the country to avoid a racial civil war. 
Those now seeking to rewrite history, free of context, and to chip away at Tutu's legacy are in a minority.
But it is also true that, particularly in their later years, both Tutu and Mandela - so affable, so inclusive - became international mascots for tolerance and forgiveness. 
And it is easy to understand why some South Africans might feel uncomfortable, even resentful, about the way these men - fierce and uncompromising struggle heroes - have been repackaged as ""cuddly"" advocates of ""rainbow-ism,"" to be wheeled out, shorn of their righteous anger, for the delight of Western audiences, rock stars and royalty. 
The truth, of course, is that Tutu was many different things to many people. In death he is claimed, and contested, just like Mandela. That is the nature of an icon. 
But what of Tutu's legacy in today's South Africa, a whole generation after he helped steer the country to democracy? 
So much time has passed since those heady days. Is it even meaningful to ponder what it means for a nation to be cut adrift from the great moral leaders of the past? 
Like Mandela, Tutu will never be forgotten. He will continue to live on as an example and inspiration to countless others. Surely, that is enough. 
And it may be a difficult thing to say, or argue, at a time when so many are mourning his death, and celebrating his joyful, prayerful, extraordinary life, but it may be no bad thing that South Africa is finally closing not just another chapter in its struggle history, but the whole book.
Why? Because it may be time, as the political commentator Eusebius McKaiser put it to me, for South Africa to find ""a different kind of hero - a more boring kind of hero"".
In a modern era of political tensions and economic gloom, the nation needs someone who can shift the focus away from its contested past and instead inspire people to focus on - and to find solutions to - today's duller, technocratic challenges.
Above all, there is the urgent task of building and reshaping an economy so that it can lift millions out of poverty and make Tutu's rainbow nation the reality he always insisted it could be.

40;Obituary: Desmond Tutu - South Africa's rebellious priest;['2021-12-26T07:08:05.000Z'];['BBC News'];['desmond tutu', 'south africa'];['countrys', 'rebellious', 'priest', 'termed', 'twonation', 'voice', 'desmond', 'south', 'opinions', 'obituary', 'africas', 'went', 'prisons', 'uk', 'criticised', 'tutu', 'britain'];"
Desmond Tutu was the smiling South African archbishop whose irrepressible personality won him friends and admirers around the world.
As a high-profile black churchman he was inevitably drawn into the struggle against white-minority rule but always insisted his motives were religious, not political.
He was appointed by Nelson Mandela to head South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate crimes committed by both sides during the apartheid era.
He was also credited with coining the term Rainbow Nation to describe the ethnic mix of post-apartheid South Africa.
Desmond Mpilo Tutu was born in 1931 in a small gold-mining town in what was then the Transvaal. 
He first followed in his father's footsteps as a teacher, but abandoned that career after the passage of the Bantu Education Act in 1953 which introduced racial segregation in schools.
He joined the church and was strongly influenced by many white clergymen in the country, especially another strong opponent of apartheid, Bishop Trevor Huddleston.
He served as bishop of Lesotho from 1976-78, assistant bishop of Johannesburg and rector of a parish in Soweto, before his appointment as bishop of Johannesburg.
It was as a dean that he first began to raise his voice against injustice in South Africa and again from 1977 onwards as general secretary of the South African Council of Churches.
Already a high-profile figure before the 1976 rebellion in black townships, it was in the months before the Soweto violence that he first became known to white South Africans as a campaigner for reform.
His efforts saw him awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 in what was seen as a major snub by the international community to South Africa's white rulers.
Desmond Tutu's enthronement as Archbishop of Cape Town was attended by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Robert Runcie, and the widow of Martin Luther King.
As head of the Anglican Church in South Africa, he continued to campaign actively against apartheid. In March 1988, he declared: ""We refuse to be treated as the doormat for the government to wipe its jackboots on.""
Six months later, he risked jail by calling for a boycott of municipal elections. 
He was caught in a cloud of tear gas in August 1989, when police took action against people leaving a church in a township near Cape Town, and the following month he was arrested after refusing to leave a banned rally.
As archbishop, his calls for punitive sanctions against South Africa struck a chord throughout the world, especially as they were coupled with a total condemnation of violence.
In 1985, Tutu and another bishop bravely and dramatically rescued a suspected police informer as he was being assaulted and about to be burnt to death by an angry mob in a township east of South Africa's main city, Johannesburg. 
The clergymen pushed through the mob and pulled to safety the bleeding, half-conscious man, just before the petrol-doused tyre around his neck was set alight.   
Tutu later returned to rebuke the man's attackers, reminding them of ""the need to use righteous and just means for a righteous and just struggle"".
Tutu warmly welcomed the liberalising reforms announced by President FW de Klerk soon after he took office. These included the lifting of the ban on the African National Congress (ANC) and the release of Nelson Mandela in February 1990.
Soon afterwards, Tutu announced a ban on clergy joining political parties, which was condemned by other churches. 
He was never afraid to voice his opinions.  In April 1989, when he went to Birmingham in the UK, he criticised what he termed ""two-nation"" Britain, and said there were too many black people in the country's prisons.
Later he angered the Israelis when, during a Christmas pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he compared black South Africans with the Arabs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
He said he could not understand how people who had suffered as the Jews had, could inflict such suffering on the Palestinians.
Desmond Tutu was a great admirer of Nelson Mandela, but did not always agree with him on issues such as the use of violence in pursuit of a just end.
In November 1995, Mandela, by then South Africa's president, asked Tutu to head a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, with the task of gathering evidence of apartheid-era crimes and recommending whether people confessing their involvement should receive amnesty.
At the end of the commission's inquiry, Tutu attacked South Africa's former white leaders, saying most of them had lied in their testimony. The commission also accused the ANC of committing human rights abuses during its fight against apartheid. Both sides rejected the report. 
Tutu was often overcome by the pain of those who had suffered under apartheid and, on more than one occasion, was reduced to tears. 
He also found much to criticise in South Africa's new black-majority government. He launched a stinging attack on the ANC administration led by President Thabo Mbeki.
He said the ANC had not done enough to alleviate poverty among the poorest in the country and that too much wealth and power was concentrated in the hands of a new black political elite. 
He later urged Jacob Zuma, who had been accused of sexual crimes and corruption, to abandon his attempts to become president.
He was also vocal in his condemnation of Robert Mugabe, once describing the Zimbabwean president as ""a cartoon figure of an archetypical African dictator"". Mugabe, in turn, described Tutu as ""evil"".
He could also be critical of his own Anglican church particularly in the aftermath of the row over the ordination of gay bishops.
""God is weeping,"" he once said when he accused the church of allowing an ""obsession"" with homosexuality to take precedence over the fight against world poverty.
He returned to the subject of poverty when he visited Ireland in 2010. He urged Western nations to consider the effect of cuts in overseas aid in the wake of the economic downturn.
Tutu formally retired from public life in the same year to, he said, spend more time ""drinking red bush tea and watching cricket"" than ""in airports and hotels"". 
But ever the rebel, he came out in support of assisted suicide in 2014, stating that life should not be preserved ""at any cost"".
Contrary to the views of many church figures, he held that human beings had the right to choose to die. 
He said his great friend and fellow campaigner Mandela, who died in December 2013, had suffered a long and painful illness which was in his opinion ""an affront to Madiba's dignity"".
In 2017, Tutu sharply criticised Myanmar's leader and fellow Nobel Peace laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, saying it was ""incongruous for a symbol of righteousness"" to lead a country where the Muslim minority was facing ""ethnic cleansing"". 
Later that year, he opposed Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the official capital of Israel. ""God is weeping,"" he wrote on Twitter, over this ""inflammatory & discriminatory"" act.
A small man, ""the Arch"", as he was known, was gregarious and ebullient, emanating a spirit of joy despite his intense sense of mission. 
He was witty, and his conversation was frequently punctuated by high-pitched chuckles.
But beyond this, Desmond Tutu was a man of impeccably strong moral convictions who strove to bring about a peaceful South Africa.

41;Colorado: Residents return following devastating fire;['2022-01-01T04:57:44.000Z'];['BBC News'];['colorado', 'wildfires', 'united states'];['street', 'flames', 'thought', 'wouldnt', 'colorado', 'open', 'return', 'following', 'electricity', 'knew', 'residents', 'went', 'walking', 'devastating', 'garage'];"
Residents of Boulder County in Colorado have returned to scenes of devastation after snowfall helped extinguish the last of a raging wildfire. 
The fire swept through 6,000 acres in just a few hours, destroying hundreds of homes.
One local resident said some families in the area that ""lost everything"" and it was a ""Christmas miracle"" that nobody was killed.
Tens of thousands of people fled as the flames engulfed the area.
The fire at its peak was driven by winds of up to 105 mph (169km/h) which caused flames to jump over highways and entire communities, local authorities told Reuters news agency. 
Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires, and experts say that fires in western North America have grown more intense in recent years.
Now snow has started to fall, officials say they do not expect the fire to pose any more danger.
People have started returning home to assess the damage, many facing scenes of complete destruction.

In Louisville, Jeff Conroy told local media that he had watched his family's house burn to the ground. 
""The fire department left before I did,"" he told USA Today. ""They knew it couldn't be saved, but I had to watch. And I stayed until our house walls were fully gone.""
Another Louisville resident, Linda Jackson, told the Denver Channel that her home of 20 years had been completely destroyed by the fire. 
""I could see flames in my backyard and I knew I had to get out,"" she said. ""I went downstairs, no electricity in my garage and my garage wouldn't open. I thought about just walking out and walking down the street, but I called 911 and the fire department came and got me out.""
She said she knew her home ""was just going to be ash"". 
Six people have been treated for injuries but no fatalities have been reported - something local officials described as a ""miracle"". 
President Joe Biden has approved a disaster relief bill that will help those affected. 
These latest fires in Colorado are burning in more suburban parts of the state and are coming relatively late in the season.

A total of 874 cars have been set alight during New Years Eve celebrations in France, police say.
However, the interior ministry said the number was much lower than in 2019. Authorities also reported a rise in the number of people stopped and detained.
A curfew to tackle Covid-19 meant no significant disruption took place this time last year. 
Car burning has effectively become an annual event in French suburbs since riots in 2005 in several cities.
Some 95,000 police and gendarmes were mobilised during recent New Year's celebrations, French media report - including 32,000 firefighters and security personnel.
In Paris, where face masks have been made compulsory again, 779 people were fined for not wearing a mask.
While restrictions have been partially lifted in France, more rules will come into place this month due to concerns for the Omicron variant.
From 3 January, public gatherings will be limited to 2,000 people for indoor events, and remote working will become compulsory for those who are able to.

43;New Year's Day is warmest on record in the UK, Met Office says;['2022-01-01T16:39:21.000Z'];['BBC News'];['met office'];['showers', 'northerly', 'met', 'winds', 'wintery', 'record', 'real', 'north', 'especially', 'southerly', 'day', 'warmest', 'replaced', 'office', 'uk'];"
The UK is having the warmest New Year's Day on record, with new high temperatures set for the second day in a row, the Met Office says. 
St James's Park in central London saw temperatures of 16.2C (61.2F) on Saturday as 2022 was ushered in. 
Warm air from the Azores has been reaching the UK in recent days, bringing unusually mild weather.
The previous New Year's Day record was set in 1916, when it reached 15.6C (60.1F) in Bude, Cornwall. 
Saturday's record is still provisional as temperatures could get even higher as the day progresses. 
Friday became the warmest New Year's Eve on record.
BBC weather forecaster Ben Rich said: ""We've had winds coming from the south and south west bringing very warm air from the Azores - nearly all the way from the tropics - wafting across the UK and it's that which has lifted the temperatures.
""It's been with us for a few days now and warming up day by day.""
Sunday will be a little colder but temperatures will be still well above normal for this time of year, he added. 
The mild weather currently being seen is widespread across the UK, he added. 
""Around Tuesday it will be much colder as the southerly winds are replaced by northerly winds,"" he said. ""There could be some wintery showers, especially in the north of the UK. It will be a real change."" 
It will drop to somewhere between 6C and 9C, he said - in line with the average temperatures of 7C or 8C for the start of January.
In Edinburgh, it could get to as low as 3C on Tuesday. 
The Met Office say the UK's record temperatures have all been elevated by manmade climate change which has raised temperatures globally by 1.1C.
Cold records are still being broken, as in the Beast from the East storm in 2018. 
But the Met Office say warm weather records are being broken nine times more frequently - a clear sign of an over-heating planet.
The winter wildfires in Colorado are arguably even more alarming than unseasonal warmth in the UK.  
It's too soon to say what role human-driven climate change may have played in the disaster - but it's the latest episode of regular weather patterns being disrupted. 
Meanwhile, different regions of Alaska are experiencing record high and low temperatures at the same time.
Climate scientists warn that we can expect many more extremes as the planet continues to heat. And attempts to reduce emissions have been undermined by several factors, including President Biden's struggle with climate policies in the USA.
The Met Office said Scotland had also recorded its warmest New Year's Day temperature, which was 15.9C in Achnagart in the Highlands. 
The previous record was 14.5C in Inverurie in 1992.  
Overnight on Friday, it reached 16.5C in Bala, Gwynedd, north Wales, making it the hottest New Year's Eve on record. 
It has been so warm that the skating rink at London's Somerset House had to close on New Year's Day because the ice was being affected.  
The Met Office also said a new provisional record had been set for the UK's highest minimum - or overnight - temperature for New Year's Day and the month of January as a whole. 
That was in Chivenor, Devon, which had a temperature of 13.2C. The previous record was 13.1C and was set in 2016.

A Belgian scientific research station in Antarctica is dealing with an outbreak of Covid-19, despite workers being fully vaccinated and based in one of the world's remotest regions. 
Since 14 December, at least 16 of the 25 workers at the Princess Elisabeth Polar Station have caught the virus.
Officials say cases remain mild so far.
""The situation isn't dramatic,"" Joseph Cheek, a project manager for the International Polar Foundation, told the BBC.
""While it has been an inconvenience to have to quarantine certain members of the staff who caught the virus, it hasn't significantly affected our work at the station overall,"" Mr Cheek said.  
""All residents of the station were offered the opportunity to leave on a scheduled flight on 12 January. However, they all expressed their wish to stay and continue their work,"" he added.
News of the outbreak was first reported in Belgian title Le Soir. 
The first positive test was recorded on 14 December, among a team who had arrived seven days earlier.
They and others who tested positive were placed in quarantine but the virus continued to circulate.
Staff arriving at the station must be vaccinated and tested for the virus. 
There are two emergency doctors at the station and new arrivals to the outpost have been suspended until the virus dissipates. 
Princess Elisabeth station is operated by the International Polar Foundation and went into service in 2009.  
It isn't the first time research stations in Antarctica have been affected by a coronavirus outbreak. 
Last year, a number of Chilean military personnel based at Bernardo O'Higgins research station were infected after sailors on a supply ship tested positive for the virus.

The United Arab Emirates has announced that it will ban citizens who have not had three doses of a vaccine against Covid-19 from travelling abroad. 
Officials said the exit ban, which comes into force on 10 January, would not apply to those who are medically exempt from receiving the vaccine.
It is the latest country to announce new curbs amid a rise in infections. 
Many countries impose strict restrictions on unvaccinated people before they are allowed in. 
This varies from a requirement for a negative Covid test before travel to mandatory quarantine upon arrival. 
More than 90% of the population in the UAE has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. About 34% had received the booster jab as of 24 December, according to Our World in Data.
Studies have found that a booster shot offers better protection against the heavily-mutated Omicron variant. , which has been spreading rapidly in countries around the world.
The new travel rules in the UAE were announced by the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
They were devised to ""ensure that health and safety are prioritised"", the Emirates News Agency reported. 
They said the ban on unvaccinated passengers would also be lifted in ""humanitarian cases"" and in cases where people were travelling for medical treatment. 
The UAE has reported over 750,000 cases of coronavirus since the pandemic began, and more than 2,000 deaths,

46;New law allowing assisted suicide takes effect in Austria;['2022-01-01T13:51:19.000Z'];['BBC News'];['austria', 'euthanasia and assisted dying'];['way', 'political', 'takes', 'seeking', 'opponents', 'placed', 'assisted', 'hurdles', 'suicide', 'effect', 'dying', 'allowing', 'parliament', 'law', 'austria', 'rules'];"
A law allowing assisted suicide has taken effect in Austria.
From Saturday, adults who are terminally ill or have a permanent, debilitating condition, can opt to make provisions for an assisted death.
Parliament approved the new law in December, following a constitutional court ruling on the issue. 
The practice will be tightly regulated, with each case assessed by two doctors - one of whom would have to be a palliative medicine expert.
Officials say the government has also allocated funds to develop palliative care to ensure no one chooses to die when other options are available.
Assisted suicide, in which somebody is given the means to end their own life, is legal in neighbouring Switzerland. 
It's also been decriminalised in several European countries, including Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Active assistance to suicide will remain outlawed in Austria, and the new rules explicitly exclude minors or those with mental health conditions.
Adults who want to end their lives must produce a diagnosis and have confirmation that they are able to make their own decisions.
After gaining approval from two doctors, patients must wait for 12 weeks to reflect on their decision - or two weeks if they have a terminal illness.
If they still want to go ahead after this waiting period, they can then get lethal drugs at a pharmacy after giving notification to a lawyer or notary.
To prevent abuse, the names of pharmacies that sell these drugs will only be disclosed to lawyers and notaries who receive these notifications, and will not be advertised publicly.
Until now, under Austrian law, anyone who induced or helped someone to kill themselves faced up to five years in prison.
An absolute ban on assisted dying was lifted by a federal court last year, which ruled that it ""violated the right of self-determination"".
But the same punishment will remain in place for those who kill another person at their ""serious and emphatic request"".
Before the new rules were approved by parliament this year, some political opponents argued that it placed too many hurdles in the way of those seeking assisted dying.
Others argued that too few restrictions were to be put in place, saying that a psychiatric evaluation was not enough to assess patients' decision-making ability.

Fireworks have killed three people and injured scores others in Europe despite bans being in place against their use.
In the Netherlands, a 12-year-old boy was killed and another seriously injured watching an adult set off a home-made device, local media reported.
Dutch police have arrested a man. 
In Germany, a 37-year-old man was killed in a fireworks explosion on New Year's Eve in the western town of Hennef. Police are investigating. 
There were several people injured in incidents around Germany, German news agency DPA reported,
At least 80 people were hurt by fireworks in the Netherlands, according to De Telegraaf, including people losing feet and hands in explosions. 
Both the Netherlands and Germany banned the sale of fireworks over the New Year period because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Dutch officials justified the move by saying firework-related injuries would put too much strain on hospitals fighting the virus.
Despite this, enthusiasts in both countries have not been deterred, with people crossing borders to buy up festive pyrotechnics or in some cases making them themselves.
In Austria there were also several incidents, including one in which a 23-year-old man was killed returning to a firework that did not detonate.

Flight cancellations in the US have hit a new peak in a Christmas season hit hard by the Covid pandemic and bad weather.
Nearly 4,400 flights around the world were cancelled on Saturday, more than 2,500 of them in the US, air traffic site FlightAware reported. 
Airlines have been struggling with staffing problems with crew quarantining after contracting Covid.
Adding to travellers' woes, heavy snow has hit the central US.
From the US cancellations, more than 1,000 are from Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports.
""Today's cancellations are driven by Omicron staffing and weather-related issues. We did pre-cancel flights in anticipation of inclement weather. We've been contacting passengers early if their flights are cancelled to give them time to rebook or make other plans,"" United Airlines said in a statement.
Sunday, when many people often return home from their Christmas holidays, is likely to bring further disruption, with more snow and heavy winds forecast.
""It's too long and there's no space to spend the time, get something to eat, it's a long time here,"" one traveller stuck at O'Hara airport told ABC news in Chicago.
More on Covid around the world:
Since 24 December, more than 12,000 flights have been cancelled in the US.
Airlines have being trying to woo crew with extra pay to tackle the staff shortages. But unions say workers fear contracting Covid or having to deal with angry passengers.
The US is facing a surge in Covid cases powered by the Omicron variant.
New York City has seen record cases despite high vaccination rates. The virus has hit everything from the police force to Broadway shows, although there has not yet been a significant hike in hospitalisations. 
The city's new mayor, Eric Adams, took office on Saturday after low key New Year celebrations.

In his first speech, he said the city would not be ""controlled by crises"".
""This pandemic has not only impacted us physically, but emotionally, and I'm going to really encourage people in this city to just find that inner peace, no matter what we're going through,"" he said. 
""We have been through tragedies before. This is a resilient city and a resilient country and I want to bring that energy,""

49;Omicron: How do you detect it?;['2021-12-13T12:18:50.000Z'];['By Philippa Roxby'];['coronavirus vaccines', 'coronavirus testing', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['serious', 'omicron', 'hospitals', 'increasing', 'dose', 'south', 'detect', 'weeks', 'seeing', 'unvaccinated', 'symptoms', 'work'];"
Thousands of cases of the new Omicron variant of coronavirus have now been detected in the UK, and small numbers of people are ending up in hospital.
With infections doubling every two to three days, health officials are warning that a large wave is set to hit the UK soon.
Swabs from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which are sent to labs for analysis, can show if the variant causing the infection looks like Omicron, Delta or something else. 
Between a third and a half of UK labs - but not all - have the required technology to detect suspected Omicron cases. That means some parts of the country may identify more Omicron cases more quickly. 
Confirming that a suspected case is Omicron requires a full genetic analysis, which takes between four and five days.
PCR tests are the ones you can order free from the government website if you have symptoms, or buy from a private company if you need one for travel purposes. There are many different makes.
The advice for people with Covid symptoms or who have a positive test result for Covid (for any variant) remains the same - you must stay at home and self-isolate for 10 days.
If you're a close contact of someone who tests positive, the rules on self-isolation are different in the four nations of the UK.
In England, from Tuesday 14 December, people who are double-vaccinated and come into contact with a person with Covid (all variants) should take daily lateral flow tests for seven days, rather than immediately self-isolating.
You can get more detail on self-isolation rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland here. 
The rules around testing and self-isolation after foreign travel have also changed.
Using a technique known as genomic sequencing, all suspected Omicron test results have been analysed and some people are confirmed to have been infected with the variant - and this number is growing.
UK experts say the new variant is spreading four times faster than the Delta variant, and could overtake it by Christmas creating a large wave of infections. 
Several studies have confirmed a large drop in neutralising antibodies - one facet of the immune system in vaccinated people - when faced with Omicron, and this means more people becoming infected and spreading the virus. But this isn't the same as a drop in the effectiveness of the vaccines. 
Experts say the vaccines should still protect people from severe illness from Omicron, and a booster jab will provide the highest protection by strengthening the immune response even more.
Currently, 81% of over-12s in the UK population have been fully vaccinated with two doses and around a third of those eligible have also had a booster, or third dose.

Rapid or lateral flow tests (LFTs), which can be used at home, tell you if you're negative or positive for coronavirus, but they can't tell you which variant of the virus you are infected with.
If you get a positive LFT result, you have a legal obligation to self-isolate immediately and must get a PCR test as soon as possible to confirm the result.
The Omicron variant has lots of different mutations that haven't been seen before, and many that have.
A large number of them are on the spike protein of the virus, which is the target of most vaccines, and that's the main concern.
In standard PCR tests, Omicron has what's known as an ""S-gene dropout"" (which Delta hasn't, in most cases) and that gives a clue that it could be the new variant.
But not all ""S-gene dropouts"" will necessarily be Omicron - full genomic sequencing is needed to be sure.
Up to 20% of the swabs from positive test results in the UK each week, or around 60,000 cases, are sent for genomic sequencing.
By looking closely at the genetic material provided, scientists can confirm whether someone is positive with Omicron or the already widely-circulating Delta.
But this process only provides information about the swabs that are analysed - it doesn't give the full picture.
However, using those results, scientists are able to estimate what proportion of new cases could be the new variant.
Scientists in the UK and South African are at the forefront of this technology, which is why most new variants have been detected in these countries. But that doesn't always mean they originated there.
So far, in South Africa, most people infected are young and their symptoms have been mild.
There is some suggestion that the variant could be causing some slightly different symptoms to Delta - including aches and pains, and no loss of taste or smell - but it's too early to say for certain.
Hospitals in South Africa are seeing more people admitted with more serious symptoms - but many are unvaccinated or have had only one dose. It will take a few more weeks to work out if deaths are increasing too.
In the UK, where large numbers of people are protected with two or three doses of a Covid vaccine, some scientists say Omicron could be much milder and have less of an impact.

50;Colorado wildfire: Three people reported missing and presumed dead;['2022-01-01T22:29:57.000Z'];['BBC News'];['colorado', 'wildfires', 'united states', 'severe weather'];['dead', 'surrounding', 'flames', 'feat', 'reported', 'pulled', 'wildfire', 'easy', 'car', 'stuff', 'colorado', 'missing', 'cats', 'driveway', 'gathered', 'presumed'];"
Three people are missing and presumed dead, after a devastating wildfire in the central US state of Colorado. 
The blaze swept through several towns, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing tens of thousands of people to flee.
The local sheriff had initially said there were no fatalities, calling it a ""miracle"".
But a spokeswoman for Boulder County admitted a mistake had been made.
""I think the sheriff probably wasn't adequately briefed by us,"" Jennifer Churchill said, in comments carried by the Colorado Sun. ""That was an unfortunate error. We feel terrible.""
No details have been released about those missing, but local media reported that one of them was a 91-year-old woman whose family said got trapped by the incoming flames.
Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said it was unlikely any of the three will be found alive.
The wildfire burned 6,000 acres across Boulder County, destroying at least 1,000 homes and businesses.
It started under unusually dry conditions and came under control in part because of snowfall. Images showed eerie scenes, with charred buildings buried under thick snow.

Residents hit by the wildfire are coming to terms with what happened, in some cases returning home to find complete destruction. 
""I feel like I made it out with my life and that's I think the most important thing,"" Jessi Delaplain, who lost her home to the fire, told CBS. 
""I gathered myself and I gathered my cats which was no easy feat to stuff them into the car. And I pulled out of the driveway and there were flames surrounding us.""
The cause of the wildfire is being investigated.
Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires, and experts say that fires in western North America have grown more intense in recent years.

51;Map drawn from memory helps reunite kidnapped Chinese man with family;['2022-01-01T20:01:44.000Z'];['BBC News'];['china'];['chinese', 'thirtythree', 'thank', 'drawn', 'kidnapped', 'perfect', 'memory', 'man', 'wrote', 'waiting', 'reunion', 'release', 'helps', 'reunite', 'map', 'profile', 'family', 'yearning'];"
A Chinese man who was abducted over 30 years ago has been reunited with his biological mother after drawing a map of his childhood village from memory.
Li Jingwei was just four-years-old when he was lured away from his home and sold into a child trafficking ring. 
On 24 December he shared a hand-drawn map to the video sharing app, Douyin, which police matched to a small village and a woman whose son had disappeared. 
After DNA tests, they were reunited in Yunnan province on Saturday.
Video footage of the reunion showed the pair meeting for the first time in over three decades  and shows Li Jingwei carefully removing his mother's coronavirus mask to examine her face before breaking down in tears and embracing her.
""Thirty-three years of waiting, countless nights of yearning, and finally a map hand-drawn from memory, this is the moment of perfect release after 13 days,"" Mr Li wrote on his Douyin profile ahead of the anticipated reunion. ""Thank you, everyone who has helped me reunite with my family.""
Mr Li was abducted near the south-western city of Zhaotong in Yunnan Province in 1989 and subsequently sold to a family living over 1,800km away. 
Now living in Guangdong Province in southern China, he had no success asking his adoptive parents or consulting DNA databases about his origins. So he turned to the internet. 
""I'm a child who's finding his home. I was taken to Henan by a bald neighbour around 1989, when I was about four years old,"" he said in the video, which was shared thousands of times. 
""This is a map of my home area that I have drawn from memory,"" he said holding up a rough guide of the village, which included features like a building he believed to be a school, a bamboo forest, and a small pond.
Child abductions are not uncommon in China, a society which places high value on having a son. 
Many children are abducted at a young age and sold to other families. In 2015, it was estimated that 20,000 children were being abducted each year. 
In 2021 there were numerous examples of young men being reunited with their biological parents after long absences. 
Last July, Guo Gangtang was reunited with his son 24 years after he was abducted in the province of Shandong.

52;BBC Sound of 2022: Colourful rapper Central Cee kicks off the countdown;['2022-01-02T00:00:35.000Z'];['By Mark Savage'];['sound of 2022', 'music'];['subconsciously', '2022', 'sure', 'countdown', 'times', 'taking', 'rapper', 'look', 'tickets', 'venue', 'bbc', 'colourful', 'sound', 'central', 'sold', 'kicks', 'sell', 'shepherds', 'cee'];"
One of the fastest-rising stars of UK rap, Central Cee has won fifth place in BBC Radio 1's Sound Of 2022.
Hailing from west London, his melodic take on drill has already earned him two Mobo Awards, and he's nominated for three Brits - including best newcomer - in February.
He burst on to the scene in 2020 with the straight-talking Day In The Life, in which he taunted his peers: ""Turn off the auto-tune, let's hear how you really rap.""
Freestyled while driving his car, the track was the culmination of 15 years of hard work. Born Oakley Caesar-Su in London's Shepherd's Bush in 1998, he's been cultivating his lyrical style since writing his first verse at the age of eight.
""I recorded my first song when I was 13 - recorded and released it,"" he told the BBC. 
""I'm 22 now, so it's coming up to 10 years. But I wasn't really in the game. I was still in school, balancing things and just going through life. It was only literally last year, 2020, where I got to take this stuff serious.""
Day In The Life and its follow-ups, Molly and Loading, framed him as a playful, mischievous character, eschewing the austere beats of drill for a more colourful sound - full of jazz samples and witty wordplay.
Amassing tens of millions of streams, the music quickly attracted the attention of record companies - but the rapper knocked them all back.
""Take that risk and go independent,"" he explained on the 2021 single Pinging. ""I just turned down six figures.""
The risk paid off, though. February's Commitment Issues secured Cee a number nine spot on the UK chart, and his first mixtape, Wild West, debuted at number two in March.
He celebrated the release by riding on horseback through Shepherd's Bush Market, and installing a giant mural on the nearby Goldhawk Road.
When Cee turned up to have his photo taken in front of it, ""50 to 60 school kids turned up after, like, five minutes,"" he recalls. 
""There's a lot of love, man.""
He ended the year with a guest verse on Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits remix, and another top 10 single, Obsessed With You - a street love song that samples fellow Sound Of 2022 nominee PinkPantheress.
Central Cee is the first act to be announced for the BBC's Sound Of 2022, which aims to predict the biggest new stars of the coming year.
The rest of the top five will be revealed daily on BBC Radio 1 and BBC News. Now in its 20th year, previous winners of the prize include Adele, Celeste, Haim, Sam Smith and Ellie Goulding.
Hey there - how has your 2021 been?
It's been an eventful one, to say the least! 
You sold out the Shepherd's Bush Empire in October. Did you ever walk past it as a kid and think, ""I'll play there one day""?
Every time I passed Shepherd's Bush Empire - which was two to three times a day for 10 to 15 years, I would look at it and I would just look and see who was on the bill, taking it in subconsciously. We could have sold a lot more tickets than that -  but it was a conscious decision to make sure I did that one. It's important to me that I did that venue no matter how many tickets I could sell. 
At the Mobos, you said you weren't sure how you felt about winning awards. Has your opinion changed now it's had time to sink in?
I still feel the same way but if I could reiterate it, what I meant is that I don't think people should feel like they need award shows to make them feel validated. We're all winners if we're in that room or releasing music, regardless of who gets the actual award.  
When you started making music, you'd record with just a MacBook and a pair of iPhone headphones. How did you teach yourself those skills?
I'm just quite observant, I'd say. So when I've downloaded the software I kinda just messed around with it. I didn't even watch no tutorials or nothing. Because I've been in the studio so many times, when I'm in the sessions I'm just watching what they do. I'm a fast learner - it was pretty straightforward.  
Where did the names Cench and Central Cee come from?
Central Cee just came. There's no interesting story behind it. And then Cench is just short for Central.  
Loading became your first chart hit in the middle of the pandemic. What was it like to see your numbers soaring while you were stuck at home?
It was strange. I couldn't get out there and interact with the fans, or perform, so I felt quite detached - just looking and experiencing everything through my phone, being at home. 
Do you feel it had to happen that way?
Timing is everything. It's God's timing. It had to happen that way.
You recorded Six For Six the same day that Loading hit the charts. How significant is that line, ""this ain't no coincidence""?
It's just the truth. 
Was there ever a time when you thought it might not happen?
Yeah - a couple times but I've been doing it for many years. For around 10 years. Within those 10 years there's obviously been bumps in the road and whatever but I was determined for the most part. 
A lot of your songs feel rooted in real situations… What's your writing technique?
My writing technique has changed since Day in A Life.  Day In A Life, I wrote outside of the studio and them times, studio time wasn't as accessible.  I was selective with it. The money was obviously coming out of my pocket - and it still is - but studio wasn't on tap the same way. So them times I'd write outside the studio and just go and record and then cut. Since Day In A Life I haven't written a song outside of the studio. I just write in the studio basically. 
The Wild West mixtape doesn't have any collaborations or features. Was that important to you?
It wasn't really premeditated, as such. By the time I had all the songs laid out, they just happened to be all on my own.
I haven't linked up to much people yet. I'm only just coming into the industry. I'm not in a rush to jump in the studio and work with everyone and this and that.
Commitment Issues and Obsessed With You are more emotional than a lot of UK rap. You could almost call them love songs. How important is it not to be boxed in by convention?
I don't try to not be boxed in by convention. It's not something I think about, but I have different emotions. I'm just a human being. So sometimes I might feel a bit more emotional or a bit more ""whatever"". 
Obsessed With You samples another Sound Of 2022 nominee, PinkPantheress... What do you think makes her special?
There's a whole list of things, which would take ages to run through, but she's one of my favourite artists though - no cap. I love everything about her. 
That song is the first track from your 23 mixtape. What can we expect when that comes out next year?
Expect big things. If you thought 'Wild West' was hard... 
And finally, what's your grand plan for 2022?
Stay alive and get richer!

53;Covid: Pupils to wear face masks in class to tackle Omicron;['2022-01-02T00:04:28.000Z'];['By Hannah Richardson'];['schools', 'department for education', 'national association of head teachers', 'state schools', 'association of school and college leaders (ascl)', 'nasuwt'];['possibility', 'periods', 'omicron', 'tackle', 'face', 'sent', 'real', 'pupils', 'remote', 'wear', 'learning', 'masks', 'schools', 'minimise', 'class', 'covid', 'short'];"
Face masks are to be worn in secondary classrooms in England's schools to reduce the spread of the Omicron variant, the government has announced.
The temporary reintroduction of face coverings aims to address concerns about schools remaining open for face-to-face learning this coming term.
Meanwhile, six school staff unions have issued a demand for urgent action to limit the spread of the virus.
They warned national exams would be put at risk without further measures.
They also called for air-cleaning units, financial support for absence cover, help with on-site testing and a relaxation of the Ofsted inspection regime.
Schools across the UK are re-opening after the Christmas break over the next week, with pupils being asked to take part in onsite Covid testing.
Until now, England was the only one of the four UK nations where face masks were not recommended for pupils in classrooms. Teachers will not have to wear them under the new guidelines.
Announcing the change - just a few days before schools reopen - England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said face coverings would be required until 26 January.
This is when the current national Plan B Covid measures run out, although they will be reviewed on or close to 4 January.
He said: ""I'm looking forward to welcoming pupils back next week to continue their face-to-face learning, which is so important for their education and wellbeing.
""There is no doubt that the Omicron variant presents challenges but the entire education sector has responded with a Herculean effort, and for that I thank each and every one of you.
""The prime minister and I have been clear that education is our number one priority. These measures will bolster our support to schools as we do everything in our power to minimise disruption.""
The government also announced it would be making 7,000 air cleaning units available to early years setting, schools and colleges.
Staff absences and rising Covid rates at the end of last term - caused by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant - have led to fears of further disruption to education.
The four main teaching unions covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland - ASCL, NAHT, NEU and NASUWT - plus the GMB and Unison, have issued a joint statement calling for urgent steps to help schools.
""We need the minimum amount of educational disruption this term in order to avoid a third successive year where GCSEs, A-levels and other exams have to be cancelled, and thereby removing the uncertainty and additional workload for students and teachers,"" it says.  
""It is essential, therefore, that the government takes immediate and urgent steps to mitigate the risk of Covid transmission and that it provides more support to minimise disruption in schools and colleges.""
Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said while there were obvious drawbacks to using face coverings in classrooms, it was clear that the Omicron variant poses a very significant additional risk.
""It is absolutely essential that everything possible is done to reduce transmission and ensure that children remain in school.""
He added that the government's decision on masks was recognition that the spring term will be extremely challenging.
""The biggest problem they face is the likelihood of high levels of staff absence caused by the prevalence of the Omicron variant."" 
He added that while schools and colleges will do their best to minimise the impact on pupils, there was a real possibility that some classes and year groups may have to be sent home for short periods of remote learning. 
General Secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers Paul Whiteman said reintroducing face masks in secondary classrooms was a sensible move, but that more should be done.
""Where schools need air filtration units to improve areas of poor ventilation, they should be provided with them, without delay.""
He welcomed the 7,000 new units but said ""adequate ventilation in classrooms should not be limited to first come, first served"".
The process by which schools can obtain these units is due to be set out by the DfE shortly.
Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said ""finally, the government has been forced to recognise, and react to, the scale of the Omicron variant and its potential impact on education"".  
""The recommendation on wearing facemasks in secondary school classrooms is overdue - but it should be a requirement.""

55;California's fires threaten to ravage mighty sequoia forests;['2022-01-01T00:02:08.000Z'];['By Justin Rowlatt'];['our planet now', 'trees', 'wildfires', 'california wildfires', 'climate change', 'forest', 'california'];['way', 'fires', 'points', 'mighty', 'looked', 'californias', 'christy', 'ravage', 'forests', 'crying', 'saw', 'tree', 'threaten', 'sequoia', 'trees', 'remains'];"
California's giant sequoias are symbols of permanence - with some living for thousands of years. But the fierce wildfires ravaging the state threaten even these mighty trees, which are among the longest-lived organisms on Earth.
There is something primeval about giant sequoias. Their weird, broccoli-like branches wouldn't seem out of place with a long-necked dinosaur plodding by. 
And they are impossibly big: 30 or 40 people would have to link hands to hug the largest ones. The tallest trees are 90m (295ft) high. That's like a 30-storey tower block.
""They make you feel deep time"", sighs Christy Bingham, as she looks up at the biggest tree in the world - known as the General Sherman. 
""You can just sense standing here that this tree was born before Jesus."" 
Christy lowers her voice as she says this, as if out of respect. She's in charge of conserving these magnificent trees in the Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada mountains - their last redoubt.
Sequoias live so long because they are exquisitely adapted to their environment, Christy tells me. 
There have always been fires in California and, in response, sequoias have developed insulating bark which can be up to a metre thick and which stops all but the hottest fires damaging the trees. 
But California's fires are changing. Christy leads me deeper into the forest, to show me what she means.
All you can hear is the sound of the wind in the leaves, the occasional cry of a raven and our footsteps crunching in the leaf litter. It is heaven. Until, that is, we walk over a ridge and the scene changes dramatically.
""This is what I wanted to show you, this was a giant sequoia grove"", she says. The landscape is monochrome now: grey or black, ash or cinders. Many of the huge trees have been reduced to columns of charcoal.
""Before 2015 no one saw a sequoia that looked like this,"" says Christy. She is crying now. ""You never saw a tree become a candle and burn up in this way before."" She points to the blackened remains of one of the biggest trees. 
""This 1,000- to 2,000-year-old tree should have lived another 500 to 800 years but it's gone."" 
Christy wipes her tears with the sleeve of her jacket. ""It will not sequester any more carbon. It will not be a spotted owl house. It's dead.""
It isn't just California's trees that have been suffering. Several hours' drive north we visit the Gold Rush-era town of Greenville. It used to be famous for its Wild West-style clapboard shops and its white painted church with its elegant wooden spire. 
All that is gone now, incinerated in the massive Dixie Fire this summer which burnt a million acres and cost some 600 million dollars to fight.
Nichoel Farris tells me how she got a text telling her to get out of town. An hour later the whole place - 1,500 buildings in total - had been erased, and her ""forever home"" with it.
""It took all the colour out of my life. Look, everything is just a shade of grey"", says Nichoel, gesturing towards the ashes of her house. ""We lost the future we'd planned for and built."" She's crying now. ""We lost our story"", she tells me.
But Nichoel hasn't lost all hope. She talks about how she wants to see the town rebuilt using the latest fire protection knowhow. She and her husband grew 80% of their food on their land and she hopes others will do the same. 
""Greenville could actually be a lighthouse community of sustainability and climate adaptation. And how we live in our new normal - because big fires are now the new normal,"" she says.
And, in the forest, Christy hasn't given up hope either. She expects to see baby sequoias sprouting here next year. They like burnt soil. And she says the forests need to be better managed, with dead wood and brush that can fuel fires cleared away.
What's more, a few of the trees, even here amongst the destruction, will survive. Christy starts to scrape with her fingers at the charred bark of a giant sequoia at the very edge of the grove. 
Not far in - about an inch or a couple of centimetres - and the charcoal gives way to reddish bark. ""This is just surface damage,"" she says. ""Look up at the leaves, lots of them have survived. This tree will live!""
The resilience of the sequoias should inspire us, says Christy: ""It is telling us we need to act on climate change now and that every little bit counts"". She turns to look me in the eye. 
""Every carbon reduction will help these forests persist,"" she says. And I notice her smile has returned as we walk on through the trees.

56;Letter from Africa: Africa plays on in 2022 without its great referee;['2022-01-02T00:05:03.000Z'];['BBC News'];['africa today podcasts'];['presidential', 'postponed', 'seen', 'muammar', 'letter', 'referee', 'great', 'pulling', 'problem', 'organising', 'polls', 'removal', 'veteran', '2022', 'plays', 'africa'];"
In our series of letters from African journalists, media and communication trainer Joseph Warungu looks at what's in store for Africa in 2022.
The year started on a sombre mood as the veteran referee in the field of justice, racial equality and political liberation, Archbishop Desmond Tutu was laid to rest in South Africa. 
The man who never hesitated to blow his whistle on unfair tackles on the oppressed by the powerful, or offside goals by those who felt they had a privileged skin colour, has left the pitch for good just seven days before the governing African National Congress (ANC) celebrates its 110th birthday in Polokwane.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa must be hoping that leftovers from the ANC birthday cake will stay fresh long enough to lift the party's voter support that has dropped to its lowest in 28 years and give him a chance to secure re-election as ANC president. 
That decision will be made at the party's national elective conference in December.
A day after the ANC birthday bash, all eyes will shift to Cameroon, which is hosting the 33rd edition of the Africa Cup of Nations. A total of 24 teams will compete in the tournament, which has been postponed twice.
Sudan, Guinea, Mali and Ethiopia have big reasons to fight hard on the pitch and try to lift the winners' trophy. 
They are countries that have experienced military coups, attempted coups or in the case of Ethiopia, a year-long civil war that has killed thousands and forced millions to flee their homes. 
Taking the Africa Cup of Nations back home would help lift the spirits of countries that enter 2022 still reeling from the effects of conflict and uncertainty. 
Guinea will be playing under fear. The new military leader has warned the team to either win the trophy or refund the money invested in them.
Tunisia is usually a strong contender on the pitch but back home, the political game is on shaky footing. President Kais Saied hopes that a referendum in July followed by parliamentary elections at the end of the year will calm the waters.
Many Tunisians supported his move to grab executive power last July, hoping it would improve the tough economic times.  Now many see him as the problem and have taken their protests to the streets. 
Unlike the other North African football giants - Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia - Libya will be missing from the Cup of Nations. 
The country has a bigger problem organising the presidential elections, which should have been held on 24 December but which have been postponed. The polls are seen as key to pulling Libya out of a decade of mayhem that has followed the removal and killing of veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
Kenya's former Prime Minister Raila Odinga is a big football fan. He sometime even makes up his own football commentary at public rallies to explain how he would deal with political rivals. 
In the August general election, the 76-year-old politician will face his fifth and perhaps biggest match yet to try and win the presidency.
His biggest opponent in the fight to take over from President Uhuru Kenyatta, whose second and final term is coming to an end, is Deputy President William Ruto. Both men are currently crisscrossing the country in big rallies to find enough numbers to see them through to State House.
In Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari is focusing on numbers of a different kind as he wants to know how many Nigerians there are.
His government is planning to conduct a national population and housing census in 2022. The last census was carried out in 2006 and put the country's population at 140 million. The National Population Commission estimates the population has now grown to around 206 million but official want to be sure.
While we wait for Nigeria to count Nigerians, the world will convene in Egypt in November to focus on a simple but elusive number: 1.5. 
The UN COP27 climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh will be hoping that after the Glasgow meeting, nations will have reviewed their greenhouse gas emission targets significantly to help the world limit global warming to below 2C, preferably to 1.5C, compared to pre-industrial temperatures. 
The sound of African music has hit a new level at the Grammy Awards. Africa will have nine nominees when music's biggest night opens in Los Angeles on 31 January.  
The nominees include Ghana's Afro-roots wizard Rocky Dawuni, South African electronic music group Black Coffee, veteran Benin singer/songwriter Angelique Kidjo and Nigerian father and son team - Femi and Made Kuti. 
The Democratic Republic of Congo has been a big exporter of music to the rest of the continent and the world. And now East Africans are eyeing DR Congo for other things beyond rumba and soukous. 
The vast nation applied to join the East African Community (EAC), which includes Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania and South Sudan. 
A study by the East African Business Council shows that China is the leading exporter of goods to DR Congo, accounting for 31.2%, followed by South Africa at 15.8% and then Zambia at 13%.
The EAC wants a share of this lucrative market, including access to the 81 million consumers in DR Congo.
In exchange, the EAC will offer DR Congo access to the larger EAC Common Market and Common External Tariff framework. It will also have access to the sea ports of Mombasa and Dar es Salaam at competitive rates. 
The decision on the admission of DR Congo will be made at the EAC Heads of State Summit in January or February.
Africa's overall economic performance will largely depend on how the Covid-19 pandemic will progress. 
For now - as football fans in Cameroon will be told - ""mask up, wash your hands and keep your distance"" remains the slogan for 2022 and the message that many African countries hope puts them on a winning streak. Happy New Year!

57;‘The doctors came and I had to tell my father he was dying’;['2021-12-28T00:04:46.000Z'];['By Dr Humera Iqbal and David Reid'];['deafness and hearing-impairment', 'sign language'];['lip', 'father', 'know', 'theyd', 'shout', 'came', 'sign', 'doctors', 'read', 'round', 'tell', 'dying', 'picture', 'hed', 'point'];"
When Francesca Bussey's deaf father was admitted to hospital in 2019, she dropped everything to be available to sign for him. But is it always appropriate for relatives to interpret for their loved ones? And are we taking advantage of goodwill to cover for a shortfall in professional interpreting services?
Francesca Bussey was at her elderly father's bedside when a doctor arrived with terrible news. 
Her profoundly deaf dad had been in hospital for a month, and although Francesca had repeatedly asked nurses to book an interpreter for him, he had received just two hours of British Sign Language (BSL) interpreting support. 
""When he was well my dad could lip read,"" Francesca says, ""but by this point he could barely see. They put up a sign behind his bed - a picture of an ear with a cross through it - and they'd come round and shout at him, and he'd be frightened and confused and not know what was going on.""
So 42-year-old Francesca - like tens of thousands of others across the UK who routinely lend their ears and signing skills to their deaf parents to help them navigate a world built for the hearing - stepped in. And without missing a beat, Francesca interpreted the news for her father that day.
""There was no time lag,"" she says, ""I was told it. I interpreted it. 
""I had to tell him he was dying."" 
Francesca grew up as a hearing child with two deaf parents in the 1980s - a time before mobiles and texting - and started signing at just seven months old.
""My first language is British Sign Language (BSL),"" she says. ""It's a huge part of me - I love my language.""
Francesca took on a lot of responsibility from a very young age - her parents had little choice but to rely on her to get things done that the rest of us take for granted. By the age of four she was making phone calls on their behalf, and by eight was dealing with the bank.
""They were always very aware of not wanting to burden me,"" she says, ""but it was just easier for me to do it. I felt very grown-up, I was different and important.""
Looking back though, Francesca says it was hard having to constantly help her parents. ""I was on call all the time,"" she says. ""I never had a time when I didn't feel responsible for communication. 
 ""As a child you aren't able to say, 'I can't do it anymore,' [because] you don't know where your boundaries are.""
Being the child of deaf parents is no ordinary upbringing. Thirty-one-year-old Glaswegian comedian Ray Bradshaw has carved out a stand-up career mining a rich seam of stories from his childhood. 
""If I swore as a kid while signing, my parents would take me into the kitchen and wash my hands with soap,"" he jokes.

Ray's material is witty, light-touch activism, often hinging on the scarce availability of BSL interpreters in schools, hospitals, and businesses. When the interpreter is a no-show, family members often jump in to fill the gap - like the time Ray mischievously stepped up to ""mistranslate"" his school parents' evening to his own advantage.
But Ray says something is wrong when people have had to translate terminal illness diagnoses to their own parents.
Prof Jemina Napier, a specialist in sign language and communication at Heriot-Watt University, says hearing children of the deaf are talented linguists. But they are also equipped with a whole slew of cognitive and emotional skills that come from being keyed into the adult world from an early age, deciphering the subtle registers of adult speech, and solving complex problems. 
Like Francesca and Ray, Prof Napier is hearing but grew up in a deaf household. She rails against the notion of deafness as a deficit, seeing it instead as a cultural identity to celebrate, and is similarly positive about interpreting. She calls it ""brokering"", to encompass a sense of the emotional negotiation involved. 
But there's a vast difference between dealing with a pizza delivery at the front door and interpreting in challenging situations as Francesca had to in hospital with her father, she says.
""Kids feel out of their depth. The emotional impact of those very high stakes settings is not appropriate.""
Thirty-year-old Pearl Clinton also had to break life-changing medical news. When she was 12 her father died, and it fell to Pearl to tell her mum. Then at the age of 28 Pearl had to explain to her grandmother that she was dying. 
Now she is campaigning to put an end to family members interpreting at medical appointments, not only because of the difficulties they face relaying complex medical information, but also because of the potential impact that having to break bad news might have on mental health.
""Since launching the petition, I've heard so many stories,"" Pearl says. ""It is still happening.""
Under the 2010 Equality Act, deaf people should have access to sign language interpreting in hospital, but in reality interpreters are thin on the ground. Hospital staff are under pressure and don't always recognise that it's an issue to rely on relatives.
""It's absolutely not their fault,"" Francesca says. ""They're ridiculously busy, they're overwhelmed, and sometimes they don't know how to do it.""
The world has moved on since Francesca's profoundly deaf mum was a child. She was sent to boarding school in 1952 when she was four years old. Francesca says the aim was to produce deaf people who could, ""function in mainstream society"" - but she simmers with anger as she describes the dreadful treatment her mother experienced there. 
""My mum was put in a straitjacket basically - they tied her arms to the bed and put her hands in gloves. Another time she was locked in an air-raid shelter,"" Francesca says.
""Imagine being a small child, punished for trying to talk to your friends and use sign language, when you can't hear anything and your family isn't there.""
Francesca says her mother is a smart woman, but she left school at 16 with no qualifications and a reading age of about nine. She says the treatment her mother endured at boarding school affected her mental health well into adulthood. 
""There is a whole generation of deaf people for whom similar things happened,"" Francesca says.  
There are still many frustrations for deaf people today. When activist and deaf parent Rubbena Aurangzeb-Tariq was employed as an accessibility consultant for a train company, she advised them that their ticket office window glass was too reflective for lip-readers. It was easily remedied with a change of lighting or non-reflective glass, but nothing was done. 
For Rubbena, this isn't just annoying, but also belittling as her 12-year-old daughter has to come along to buy her train tickets. 
But there have been many positive changes. Growing deaf awareness is making a difference. Deaf parents have access to better education, and information technology means that they are much less reliant on their hearing children. 
There are organisations for the children of deaf adults (CODAs), where people can share their experiences and celebrate their heritage, and a historic lack of representation in the mainstream media is also being challenged. 
When 27-year-old Rose Ayling-Ellis, who plays Frankie Lewis, a deaf EastEnders' character who left Walford in November, became the first deaf contestant on Strictly Come Dancing this year, there were reports of record numbers of people searching for signing courses online.
Ella Depledge, aged 21, is one of the younger generation of hearing children who feel less pressure about interpreting for their deaf parents than others perhaps have in the past. 
""It's stressful,"" Ella says, ""I used to feel very heavily responsible and it wasn't good for me. I made a decision a while ago to just say 'no'.""
Ella's parents support her decision, but she appreciates the linguistic insights her early interpreting has given her and has just finished a degree in English at King's College, London. 
""If you can sign, it gives you a really cool understanding of language,"" she says. 
Francesca's lifelong responsibility for interpreting on behalf of her parents has shaped her, too. She has a successful career subtitling for a TV network and laughs as she describes herself as very good at ""adulting"" and never being late for anything.
But being a daughter and an interpreter all at once - and finding out that her father was dying one moment and having to relay that information the next - was difficult. 
""I've done a lot of hard things in my life,"" she says, ""but that was the hardest.""

Denmark's government has announced a goal to make domestic flights fossil fuel free by 2030. 
In her New Year's address, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she wants to ""make flying green"". 
However she acknowledged that the solutions to reach her target were not yet in place.
Denmark is aiming for a 70% cut in overall emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.
""To travel is to live and therefore we fly,"" said Ms Frederiksen, announcing her plan.
""When other countries in the world are too slow. Then Denmark must take the lead and raise the bar even more,"" she said. 
She added that achieving green domestic flights will be difficult but researchers and companies are working on solutions. 
The European manufacturer Airbus has announced plans to develop hydrogen-fuelled planes that could be operational by 2035. 
If the hydrogen used to fuel them is generated using renewable energy, this could be a way for Denmark to reach its goals. 
However it is unclear if the technology will be ready, and costs sufficiently low, for the 2030 target to be reached.
Sweden has also announced plans to make its domestic flights fossil fuel free by 2030. It is also hoping to make international flights green by 2045. 
Earlier this year, the government there announced plans to introduce increased airport fees for high-polluting planes. 
Meanwhile France is moving to ban domestic flights where the same journey could be made by train in under two-and-a-half hours. 
The measures could affect travel between Paris and cities including Nantes, Lyon and Bordeaux.

59;Climate change: Living by coal tip leaves family fearing rain;['2022-01-01T21:53:44.000Z'];['By Will Fyfe'];['university of exeter', 'merthyr tydfil', 'welsh government', 'julie james', 'coal mining'];['trialling', 'change', 'methods', 'tip', 'climate', 'used', 'rain', 'coal', 'right', 'tips', 'living', 'vital', 'welsh', 'stability', 'fearing', 'leaves', 'understand', 'family', 'technology'];"

Every time it rains, Phil Thomas is beset with worry and anxiety after finding out his young family are living below a potentially dangerous coal tip.
He has even thought about which way to run ""if something starts pouring down the hill"" behind their home.
""We've got no chance in reality,"" the 39-year-old father of two admits.
Concerns about coal tips in Wales were put into stark focus when heavy storms caused 60,000 tonnes of spoil to run down a hillside in 2020.
No-one was injured in the slip down the empty valley at Tylorstown in Rhondda Cynon Taf, but the Welsh government has since revealed there are still almost 2,500 disused tips.
Most have been concealed by nature and largely forgotten about but 327 are still classed as ""higher risk"", meaning they need to be regularly inspected for signs of movement, although do not necessarily pose an ""imminent"" threat.
The Welsh government is yet to say publicly where the most dangerous tips are or how many people live beneath them. 
It was in February last year that Phil, who runs a microbrewery, sat down at his local archives as a last resort after months of failing to get answers about a potential coal tip near his village of Ynyshir in Rhondda Cynon Taf.
He hoped the dusty old document in front of him could finally put his mind at rest. 
Instead, the report, written in the wake of the Aberfan disaster that killed 144 people in 1966, showed that his house - along with 20 others - had been described as ""at risk"" by engineers investigating the safety of the local tip.
""It made me sick to the core of my stomach,"" he said.
""I've got a family, that's our house. We've been there for eight years. This hasn't ever been mentioned, even when we purchased the house.""
Such was the concern in the report done half a century ago, there was even a sentence about how much it might cost to buy the residents out of their homes.
In his community, the tip had been largely forgotten about over the decades - grass now covers the open black scars that once made them so easy to spot on the hillside.

""I thought, perhaps naively, that most of the coal tips were made safe,"" said Phil.
""It makes you worried every time that it rains that something could happen, not just for me but for the 327 other high-risk tips out there in Wales.
""What do we do if something starts pouring down the hill? We've got no chance.
""If we could get the information today, I'm certain that people would be safer than they are without the information.""
At the same time that Phil started his own quest for answers, both the Welsh and UK governments set up a coal tip safety taskforce.
The Welsh government quickly concluded that climate change and increased rainfall meant ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" were needed to make ""legacy"" coal tips safe for good.
Wales' climate change minister has since said plans were in place for a mobile phone alert system which could warn residents ""if there is a problem"".
The Welsh government said it would not reveal the precise locations of coal tips until later this year because of extra checks with ""accuracy"" and potential ""data protection issues"".
The Welsh government has already admitted that insurance and housing will likely be among the things affected when people find out they live underneath these tips.
As many as 70% of Wales' coal tips are believed to be on private land, including the one overshadowing Phil's family home. 
However, the law means that councils have little ability to force an intervention unless they can prove a private tip is a ""clear and imminent threat"".
It is a system described as ""unfit for purpose"" by some local authorities - and the Welsh government has asked the Law Commission to review the current setup.
The Welsh government said it was ""trialling different methods to understand the best technology that could be used to inform of any changes in the stability of the tips"" as it was ""vital"" they made the right choice.
""In time, we would like to be able to share this information directly with people in local communities but need to do this in a way that we do not create false alarm or concern,"" a spokesman said.

60;In the footsteps of the women who escaped a Nazi death march;['2022-01-02T00:55:01.000Z'];['By Lucy Wallis'];['france', 'long reads', 'world war two'];['death', 'nazi', 'sent', 'operations', 'mother', 'multiple', 'reunited', 'war', 'weak', 'footsteps', 'women', 'tuberculosis', 'members', 'escaped', 'zinka'];"
When Gwen Strauss' great-aunt revealed she had led a group of nine Resistance women in an escape from a Nazi death march in 1945, Gwen wanted to find out more. It set her on a path that would see her retrace the women's steps and ensure the bravery of their work was recognised over 75 years later.
Gwen Strauss was enjoying a leisurely lunch with her 83-year-old great-aunt, Hélène Podliasky.
Hélène was French and Gwen, an American author, lives in France.
It was 2002 and the conversation turned to Hélène's past. Gwen knew her great-aunt had worked in the Resistance in France during World War Two, but didn't know anything about that time in her life. 
Hélène told the story of how she was captured by the Gestapo, tortured and deported to Germany to a concentration camp. As the allies drew near, the camp was evacuated and she was forced to walk for miles on a Nazi death march.
""Then I escaped with a group of women,"" she said briefly.
Gwen was astounded.
""It was nearing the end of her life, I think she felt ready to speak about it,"" says Gwen, ""and as [with] many survivors who had kept silent for years, they often didn't speak to their immediate family, they would speak to someone a little bit distanced from the family.""
Hélène Podliasky was only 24 when she was arrested working as an agent de liaison for the Resistance in the north east of France. Her nom de guerre, or fake name, was Christine. Hélène spoke five languages including German, and was a highly qualified engineer.
""She was quite high up in the Resistance,"" says Gwen. ""She had been working for over a year contacting agents and guiding parachute drops of material. She was brilliant. An elegant, quiet, but forceful person.""
It was the final years of the war, and Hélène had been arrested in 1944 after a big push by the Nazis to try to break up all the Resistance networks in France. Also swept up in the arrests around this time were eight other women. Hélène's school friend was one of them.
Suzanne Maudet (nom de guerre: Zaza) was optimistic, kind and generous says Gwen. A month after she got married at the age of 22 to fellow Resistance member, René Maudet, the couple were arrested for helping young French men escape underground into the Resistance instead of being drafted to work in the German factories.
""Then there was Nicole Clarence, who was in charge of all the agents de liaison in the whole Paris region,"" says Gwen - which put her in immense danger. Aged just 22, she was arrested three weeks before the liberation of Paris in August 1944 and was deported on the last transport out of the city.
Jacqueline Aubéry du Boulley (Jacky) was also one of the last prisoners to be taken away from Paris. Aged 29, Jacky was the oldest in the group, a war widow and part of a key intelligence network in the Resistance, says Gwen. She had been raised by an aunt and uncle as her father was a seaman and away at sea.
""When he came home she moved in with him,"" says Gwen. ""She was pretty salty that way. She kind of spoke like a sailor and she spoke her mind. She smoked all the time, she had a really deep gravelly voice. She was tough.""
Gwen also describes her as incredibly loyal and caring.
Madelon Verstijnen (Lon) and Guillemette Daendels (Guigui) were 27 ad 23 when they were arrested. Good friends, they came from upper-class Dutch families says Gwen.
""They came to Paris to join the Dutch network, but were swept up immediately and arrested almost upon arrival,"" she says. ""Guigui was an athletic, much more ethereal, serene person, whereas Lon was kind of an elbow in, 'I got to be in the middle of things,' kind of a person.""
Gwen refers to Renée Lebon Châtenay (Zinka) as ""incredibly brave"". Described by Lon as a ""little doll,"" Zinka was said to be short with blonde curls and a gap between her front teeth. She and her husband worked for a network that helped British airmen escape back to England.
Zinka was arrested at the age of 29 says Gwen, and had a baby in prison who she named France. She was only allowed to keep her baby for 18 days before she was taken away and Zinka was deported to Germany. Zinka always said she had to survive for her daughter.
Then there was Yvonne Le Guillou (Mena). Gwen describes her as a working class girl who ""loved to be in love"". She worked with the Dutch networks in Paris and had fallen for a Dutch boy at the time. She was arrested at the age of 22.
The youngest of the nine was Joséphine Bordanava (Josée), who was just 20 when she was arrested in Marseille. She was Spanish, says Gwen, and had the most beautiful singing voice.
Josée, she says, would calm and soothe the children by singing to them.
The nine were all transferred to Ravensbrück, a concentration camp for women in northern Germany, and then sent to work in a labour camp in Leipzig making armaments. It was here where they forged a strong friendship.
The conditions in the camp were horrific. They were starved, tortured, stripped naked and forced to stand in the icy snow for inspections.
They survived by creating a network of friendship. In the camp they had a tradition, says Gwen, which would involve passing around a bowl of solidarity and everyone would put in a spoonful of their soup. They would then give the bowl to the woman who needed it the most that day.
The hunger was painful, but the women found talking about food reassuring says Gwen. Every night Nicole would recite her recipes of chestnut cream or a bavarois with strawberries soaked in kirsch. She would write these down on scraps of paper they had managed to steal from the office and Nicole made it into a recipe book with part of her mattress forming the cover.
When Gwen recorded Hélène's full account of what happened she says her great-aunt had wanted her to know that even though they were incarcerated, they were still soldiers, and the women worked together sabotaging the making of the shells for a weapon called the panzerfaust. 
In April 1945 the allies had bombarded the factory so many times and the Nazis decided to evacuate the camp says Gwen, leading 5,000 starving, exhausted women in thin clothes and with bleeding and blistered feet, east across the German countryside.
Gwen says the women realised how dangerous this march was.
""They really knew that they had one choice,"" says Gwen, ""they had to either escape or they would be killed or die starving. So they found a moment when there was a kind of chaos and they jumped into a ditch and pretended that they were a pile of corpses. There had been so many piles of corpses that it worked and the march continued without them.""
Over the next 10 days, the women set off to find the American soldiers on the front line. Jacky had diphtheria, says Gwen, Zinka had tuberculosis, Nicole was recovering from pneumonia, Hélène had chronic hip pain. They had broken bones and were starving, but they were determined to find freedom together.
It took a lot of detective work and three trips to Germany to discover the exact route that the women took. What struck Gwen, retracing the women's steps, was how little progress they made each day.
""They only go five or 6kms sometimes,"" says Gwen.
""The irony is they're starving so they need food and they need some place to sleep safely, so they need to go to villages and talk to people, but every time they go to a village, that's the most dangerous time for them,"" says Gwen, ""because they could walk in to a trap or be killed by the villagers.""
Hélène and Lon, who both spoke German, would always go on ahead to ask permission from the head of the village to sleep in a barn, or spare any food.
""They decide pretty soon that the best strategy was to act as if there's nothing wrong with them being there, just to pretend like everything is fine and they're not scared,"" says Gwen.
When they realise the Americans on the front line are the other side of the Mulde river in Saxony, Germany, it is the final hurdle to cross.
""For me the most poignant was to stand at the bridge at the Mulde and look at the river,"" says Gwen. She had found information about the women from their military archives, from some of the women's own written accounts of their escape, from filmmakers who had researched Lon's story and by talking to the women's families.
She had discovered that crossing the river was one of the most harrowing moments for the women during the escape.
Having made it to the other side, there was a moment when some of the women feared they couldn't go on. Jacky was struggling to breathe, but the women were determined no-one would be left behind. Just then a Jeep roared up towards them and two American soldiers jumped out, offering them safety and a cigarette.
During her research Gwen says she discovered how difficult it was for the women to return to normal life after the war.
""They looked gaunt and terrible, and there was a kind of a shame around being a woman that was in a camp and… a kind of loneliness too,"" says Gwen.
""They were so close as a group and suddenly they're dispersed with people they can't talk to, people that don't want to hear it. So I think it must have been really psychologically isolating. I think it's like PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), but unrecognised, because they [were] not considered soldiers.""
As young women, they were often told after the war to keep their stories quiet, so their heroism went unrecognised, says Gwen.
""Out of the 1,038 Compagnons de la Libération, which was the group that [President Charles de Gaulle] considered the leaders of the Resistance, there were six women, and four of them were already dead,"" says Gwen. ""So that's laughable, because the Resistance was probably at least 50% women.""
Some of the women decided to cut off from the past says Gwen and move on, but others such as Guigui and Mena stayed friends for life and were godmothers to each other's children.
""The women did come together quite late again, around the time that my aunt told me the story, they had a bit of a reunion, the surviving group,"" says Gwen.
But what happened to Zinka's baby, France?
Gwen says she had been looking for her for about three years. ""By weird coincidence I did actually find her and when I went to see her she lives not that far from where I live in southern France,"" says Gwen. ""She said, 'Well imagine me after 70 years to learn all this about my mother.""
France had been reunited with her mother after the war, but Zinka was very ill and had to have multiple operations because of the tuberculosis she had contracted in the camp. Zinka was sometimes too weak to look after her daughter when she was growing up, says Gwen, and she would often be sent to live with other members of the family.
Zinka died in 1978, but France did not know about the story of her mother's escape. ""She didn't know how important she had been to her mother,"" says Gwen, ""and to her mother's survival.""
Great-aunt Hélène passed away in 2012. Towards the end of her life there were moments when it was clear Hélène was still haunted by the past, says Gwen, in a book she has written.
""Women bear the brunt of wars in ways that were unacknowledged, profound ways, and I want that to be recognised and known,"" says Gwen.
Yet Gwen also wants the ""amazing acts of kindness and generosity"" to be acknowledged too. ""All of these little ways they held each other up are so beautiful, I think they should be celebrated as well.""
Gwen has written a book about her great-aunt's story called The Nine.

61;EU plans to label gas and nuclear energy 'green' prompt row;['2022-01-02T05:30:50.000Z'];['BBC News'];['cop26', 'climate change', 'nuclear power'];['proposal', 'plants', 'gas', 'plans', 'waste', 'reports', 'strict', 'nuclear', 'standards', 'released', 'prompt', 'row', 'welle', 'green', 'eu', 'label', 'energy'];"
The European Commission has proposed plans to label some gas and nuclear power as green, prompting criticism from Germany. 
The proposal argues that gas and nuclear are key to helping transition to cleaner power. 
But Germany's environment minister called the plan ""absolutely wrong"".
It comes months after countries pledged to keep temperature rises within 1.5C at the COP26 climate summit. 
""It is necessary to recognise that the fossil gas and nuclear energy sectors can contribute to the decarbonisation of the Union's economy,"" the Commission's proposal says. 
Under the proposal, only gas and nuclear plants with the highest standards would be considered green. Nuclear plants would also have to have strict waste disposal plans, Deutsche Welle reports. While gas plants would have a limit of how much carbon dioxide is released per kilowatt-hour of energy produced. 
If a majority of EU members back the proposal then it will become law from 2023. 
France had reportedly pushed for nuclear power to be included. The country relies on nuclear energy for 70% of its electricity, although this will be cut to half over the next 15 years. 
France has also pledged to reduce its reliance on nuclear power by shutting down 12 nuclear reactors by 2035. 
The move has been criticised by Germany, which is in the process of phasing out nuclear completely and only has a few plants remaining.
German Environment Minister Steffi Lemke described the proposal as ""wrong"", adding that nuclear energy could lead to environmental disasters and large amounts of nuclear waste. 
Economy and Climate Protection Minister Robert Habeck called the plan ""greenwashing"", saying it ""waters down the good label for sustainability.""

A large fire is raging at the Houses of Parliament in the South African city of Cape Town. 
Video footage shows a plume of black smoke filling the sky, with huge flames coming out from the roof of the building. 
Dozens of firefighters are at the site battling the blaze; it is not yet clear what caused the fire.
It comes hours after Archbishop Desmond Tutu's state funeral at St George's Cathedral, near Parliament.
The roof area had caught fire and the National Assembly building was on fire too, the city authorities said.
""The fire is not under control and cracks in the walls of the building have been reported,"" a spokesman for the city's emergency services told the AFP news agency.
The fire was currently on the third floor, with initial reports indicating it started in the office space of the building and was spreading towards a gym at the site, city officials said.
The Houses of Parliament in Cape Town are made up of three sections, with the oldest dating back to 1884. The newer sections built in the 1920s and 1980s house the National Assembly.

South Africa has one of the continent's biggest and most developed economies. 
Up until 1994 it was ruled by a white minority government, which enforced a separation of races with its policy called apartheid. 
The apartheid government eventually negotiated itself out of power after decades of international isolation, armed opposition and mass protests. 
The democratically-elected leadership encouraged reconciliation and set about redressing social imbalances, but the economy has struggled.
President: Cyril Ramaphosa
Cyril Ramaphosa was elected president by parliament in February 2018 after his predecessor, Jacob Zuma, resigned over corruption allegations. 
A successful but sometimes controversial businessman, Mr Ramaphosa was picked as leader of the governing African National Congress (ANC) a few months earlier. 
He inherited a struggling economy, a divided party, and the problem of entrenched corruption. 
Unlike many senior party figures of his generation, Mr Ramaphosa was not driven into exile for opposing apartheid. 
He fought the injustices of white minority rule from within South Africa, most prominently by defending the rights of black miners as leader of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).
He was heavily involved in the talks to end apartheid, and played an important role in the drafting of South Africa's post-apartheid constitution.
After missing out on becoming then President Nelson Mandela's deputy, Mr Ramaphosa withdrew from active political life, switching focus to business.
He returned as deputy president in 2014, before finally taking the top job from the scandal-plagued Mr Zuma. He passed his first test when the ANC won the May 2019 parliamentary elections, although its 58% share of the vote was its lowest margin of victory since the end of apartheid.

South Africa is the continent's major media player, and its broadcasters and press reflect the diversity of its people.
Established state-run and commercial TV broadcast nationally, and hundreds of thousands of viewers subscribe to satellite and cable. South Africa-based MultiChoice markets satellite pay-TV in dozens of African countries.
Some key events in South Africa's history: 
1910 - Formation of Union of South Africa by former British colonies of the Cape and Natal, and the Boer republics of Transvaal, and Orange Free State.
1912 - Native National Congress founded, later renamed the African National Congress (ANC).
1948 - Policy of apartheid (separateness) is adopted when National Party (NP) takes power.
1960 - Seventy black demonstrators killed at Sharpeville. ANC banned.
1976 - More than 600 killed in clashes between black protesters and security forces during uprising which starts in Soweto. The challenge to white rule escalates over the years.
1991-1994 - Negotiated end to apartheid leads to first non-racial elections and formation of a Government of National Unity under Nelson Mandela.
2009 May - Parliament elects Jacob Zuma as president. He resigns in 2018 over corruption charges.

64;South Korean crosses DMZ in rare defection to North Korea;['2022-01-02T08:03:19.000Z'];['BBC News'];['south korea', 'north korea'];['dmz', 'korean', 'landmines', 'world', 'supposed', 'hours', 'crosses', 'surrounded', 'defection', 'surveillance', 'south', 'north', 'wire', 'korea', 'rare'];"
A South Korean citizen has crossed the heavily fortified border into North Korea in an apparent defection, South Korea's military says.
The person was able to evade detection for several hours despite a search operation by South Korean troops.
Military chiefs in Seoul said they did not know if the person was still alive, but had sent a message to the North asking for them to be protected.
North Korea has implemented a shoot-on-sight policy during the pandemic.
The person was detected in the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), which separates the two Koreas, at a point on the east coast at about 21:20 local time (12:20 GMT) on Saturday, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.
Defence officials in Seoul had pledged to overhaul the border defence system after similar breaches in the past.
In September 2020 North Korean troops shot and burned a South Korean fisheries official who went missing at sea. The incident sparked uproar. Pyongyang blamed the anti-virus rule and apologised.
North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un had earlier declared a national emergency and sealed off a town after a North Korean defector who Mr Kim said had Covid symptoms crossed into the North from the South.
North Korea's pandemic-related lockdowns and restrictions on movement within the country have also reduced the number of defections from the North to the South.
The border between North and South Korea is one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world. It is filled with landmines, surrounded by electric and barbed wire fencing and surveillance cameras and armed guards are supposed to be on alert 24 hours a day.

65;What does future warfare look like? It's here already;['2021-12-30T01:55:44.000Z'];['By Frank Gardner'];['china', 'russia', 'military', 'united states'];['objectives', 'look', 'scale', 'warfare', 'right', 'prosperous', 'open', 'speed', 'war', 'does', 'technologies', 'future', 'able', 'really'];"
The year 2021 has seen a fundamental shift in British defence and security policy. Up goes the budget for digital technology, artificial intelligence and cyber. Down goes the money for more traditional hardware and troop numbers.
All of this at a time when Russian forces are massing on Ukraine's borders, Moscow has been demanding Nato withdraw from some of its member states, and China is making ever louder noises about retaking Taiwan - by force if necessary.
Small, regional conflicts still erupt around the globe. Ethiopia has a civil war, Ukraine's separatist conflict has killed over 14,000 people since 2014, Syria's insurgency simmers on and Islamic State group is rampaging through parts of Africa.
But what does the future of great-power warfare look like and is the West a match for the challenges ahead?
First off, ""future warfare"" is already here. Many of the aspects of a major conflict between the West and say, Russia or China, have already been developed, rehearsed and deployed. 
On 16 November, Russia carried out a missile test in space, destroying one of its own satellites. Over the summer China conducted tests of its advanced hypersonic missiles, capable of travelling at many times the speed of sound. Offensive cyber attacks, whether disruptive or predatory, have become a regular daily occurrence, something known as ""sub-threshold warfare"". 
Michele Flournoy was a Pentagon policy chief for US strategy under both Presidents Clinton and Obama. She believes the West's focus on the Middle East for the past two decades has allowed its adversaries to do a lot of catching up in military terms.
""We are really at a strategic inflection point where we - the US, the UK and our allies - are coming out of 20 years of focusing on counter terrorism and counter insurgency, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and lifting our gaze to realise we are now in a very serious great-power competition,"" she says.
She is referring, of course, to Russia and China, described respectively in the UK government's Integrated Review as ""the acute threat"" and the long-term ""strategic rival"" to the West. 
""While we were focused on the broader Middle East,"" she says, ""these countries went to school on the Western way of war. And they started investing massively in a whole host of new technologies.""
Much of this has been directed at cyber activity - disruptive attacks aimed at undermining the fabric of Western society, influencing elections, stealing sensitive data. This is well below the threshold of warfare and much of it deniable. 
But what if the current tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, say, or between the US and China over Taiwan broke out into hostilities? What would that look like? 
""I think this would play out in a very fast-paced environment that's heavily reliant on the information domain,""says Meia Nouwens, a senior research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) focusing on China's use of data for military advantage. 
""China's People's Liberation Army has built a new agency called the Strategic Support Force which looks at space, electronic warfare and cyber capabilities.""
Meaning what, in practice? Well, almost the first things that would happen in any hostilities would be massive cyber attacks by both sides. There'd be attempts to ""blind"" the other by knocking out communications, including satellites, or even cutting the vital undersea cables that carry data. 
I asked Franz-Stefan Gady, a specialist on future warfare at the IISS, what this would mean for you and me, here on the ground. Could our phones suddenly stop working, petrol stations run dry and food distribution get thrown into chaos?
""In all likelihood, yes,"" he says. ""Because great powers are massively investing not only in offensive cyber capabilities but also in electronic warfare capabilities that can jam satellites and bring down communication. So not just the military but societies overall will be a prime target in future conflict.""  
The biggest military danger here is unplanned escalation. If your satellites are not communicating and your planners sitting in their underground command bunkers can't be sure what's going on, then it makes it extremely hard to calibrate the next move. 
Meia Nouwens believes this leaves them with the choice of responding in either a ""minimalist"" or ""maximalist"" fashion, which carries the inherent risk of further escalating tensions.
One factor that is likely to play a major role in future warfare is artificial intelligence - AI. This can massively speed up commanders' decision-making and response times, allowing them to process information far more quickly. 
Here, the US has the qualitative edge over its potential adversaries and Michele Flournoy believes it can offset areas where the West is outnumbered by the vast size of China's People's Liberation Army.
""One of the ways to gain some quantitative mass back and to complicate adversaries' defence planning or attack planning is to pair human beings and machines,"" she says. ""So if you have one manned platform that can control 100 unmanned platforms, then you start to buy back that quantitative balance.""
But there's one area where the West is falling dangerously behind Russia and China. That's hypersonic missiles - super-charged projectiles that can fly at anywhere between five and 27 times the speed of sound and carry either a conventional or nuclear warhead. 
Russia has announced successful tests of its Zircon hypersonic cruise missile, proclaiming that it can defeat any defences anywhere in the world.
China's Dong Feng 17, first revealed in 2019, carries a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) that can manoeuvre through the atmosphere with an almost unpredictable trajectory, making it hard to intercept. 
Recent tests of US systems, by contrast, have not gone well. The arrival of these weapons in China's arsenal is now making Washington think twice about going to war to defend Taiwan if China does decide to invade it.
Yet right now, on the cusp of 2022, the Russian forces massing on Ukraine's border, while certainly inclusive of offensive cyber and electronic warfare capabilities, are mainly composed of conventional hardware, such as tanks, armoured vehicles and troops - the same sort of hardware that would be deployed if Moscow decided to roll back into the Baltic states, for example. 
The UK has taken the decision to cut its conventional forces in favour of investing in new technology. Franz-Stefan Gady, the specialist in future warfare, believes this will certainly yield benefits in 20 years' time but before then there will be a worrying gap.
""I think we're going to have a very dangerous period within the next five to 10 years when a lot of the downsizing is going to happen. At the same time, a lot of these emerging technological capabilities will not be mature enough to really have an operational impact,"" he says.
And those next five to 10 years could well see some of the most dangerous challenges to Western security. So is it all doom and gloom? Not according to Michele Flournoy, who spent years right at the heart of US defence policy. She believes the solution is two things - close consultation and collaboration with allies and investment in the right places.
""If we put our minds together and really invest in the right technologies, the right concepts, and we develop those with speed and scale, we should be able to deter great-power war,"" she says. ""We should be able to achieve our objectives and keep the Indo-Pacific, for example, free and open and prosperous into the future.""

66;Who is Ghislaine Maxwell? The story of her downfall;['2021-12-29T23:28:10.000Z'];['By Jon Kelly'];['new york city', 'ghislaine maxwell', 'jeffrey epstein'];['power', 'shoulder', 'downfall', 'powerful', 'pasternak', 'undergraduate', 'maxwell', 'social', 'ghislaine', 'parties', 'writer', 'oxford', 'somebody'];"
She was the toast of high society in London and New York. Now Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted of grooming and trafficking underage girls. 
Ghislaine Maxwell was born on Christmas Day 1961. Three days later, a car carrying her 15-year-old brother Michael crashed into a lorry along a foggy Oxfordshire road. Michael Maxwell would spend the remaining seven years of his life in a coma.
Although she had been born into material abundance - her father was the publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell - by every account, Ghislaine Maxwell's earliest years were disfigured by emotional neglect. Betty, her mother, later admitted in her memoir that after Michael's accident the baby ""was hardly given a glance"" by her devastated parents.
One day in 1965, according to Betty, three-year-old Ghislaine Maxwell stood in front of her and declared: ""Mummy, I exist."" Betty also believed the toddler developed anorexia. To compensate, from this point both parents went to the opposite extreme and began lavishing affection on their youngest child.
Though she was never spared the abuse and the rages her father would inflict on every one of his offspring, she would soon emerge as his favourite. And, Betty would later write in her 1994 memoir, that favourite daughter ""became spoiled, the only one of my children I can truly say that about"".
Now a New York court has convicted Ghislaine Maxwell of charges so shocking - grooming and sex trafficking girls for abuse by the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein - it's tempting to look for an explanation in her dysfunctional childhood.
But just as her crimes are impossible to excuse, Maxwell is a difficult woman to comprehend. For a life lived in public, the fine details of her biography have always been unusually elusive.
Maxwell was raised in Headington Hill Hall, a vast Italianate mansion overlooking Oxford in the UK. Rather than buying it himself, her plutocrat father had somehow persuaded its owner, Oxford City Council, to rent it to him for a minimal sum in return for renovating the property. It was, he said, ""the best council house in the country"".
Throughout Ghislaine Maxwell's childhood, lavish parties were thrown at Headington Hill Hall, with politicians, celebrities and media grandees in attendance. But after the VIPs had left the building it was a deeply emotionally austere place to grow up.
Robert Maxwell had risen from extreme poverty in a Czechoslovak Jewish settlement - most of his family were murdered in the Holocaust - to become a British Army war hero, then an academic publishing magnate, a Labour MP and eventually owner of the Daily Mirror, one of the UK's biggest-selling newspapers.             
As a businessman, he was reviled as a bully. At home, meanwhile, he is depicted in Fall, John Preston's biography, as a ""draconian father"" who abused his children both physically and verbally.
They would be interrogated at the dinner table about geopolitics or their plans for the future and reduced to tears if he considered their answers unsatisfactory. ""He would beat us with a belt - girls as well as boys,"" another of Robert's offspring, Ian, told Preston.
Although his favourite, Ghislaine Maxwell wasn't immune from any of this. But while some of her siblings withdrew or rebelled, she was always anxious to please her father - she told Tatler in 2000 he was an ""inspiring"" parent - and dedicated herself to keeping him happy. It must have worked, after a fashion - Maxwell Snr later named his private yacht the Lady Ghislaine, rather than after Betty or his three older daughters.
And evidently, he had grand hopes for his youngest daughter - he apparently harboured ambitions of marrying her off to the late John F Kennedy Jnr.
She was educated at Marlborough College and Oxford University, where she studied modern history and languages. 
""It was very clear to me even as an undergraduate that she was interested in power and money,"" says the writer Anna Pasternak, who was a contemporary at Oxford and moved in the same social circles. ""She was one of those people at parties who always looked over your shoulder to see if there was somebody more powerful or more interesting while she was air-kissing you.""
Rachel Johnson, the UK prime minister's sister and another Oxford contemporary, recently raised eyebrows when she recalled spotting Ghislaine Maxwell across the Balliol junior common room - ""a shiny glamazon with naughty eyes holding court astride a table, a high-heeled boot resting on my brother Boris's thigh.""
After graduating, Maxwell's father appointed her as a director at Oxford United, the football club he owned and chaired, and also set her up with her own company supplying corporate gifts.
But in the pages of Tatler or Nigel Dempster's Daily Mail gossip column, where she was now a regular fixture, she was usually described as a ""socialite"" rather than a businesswoman. She began dating Count Gianfranco Cicogna, an Italian aristocrat.
She also founded a kind of private member's club exclusively for women. Pasternak attended on a few occasions and, while the idea seemed innovative at the time, she considered Maxwell an unlikely feminist champion.
""My recollection is that she was kind of breezily charming to other women, but I don't remember her being a very close friend of another woman,"" Pasternak says. ""I think that women weren't really important to her - only as a means to get to another powerful man.""
In January 1991, after her father acquired the struggling New York Daily News, she was dispatched to its headquarters as his representative. It was her point of entry into the social scene of Manhattan.
But in November that year, her world was upended. Her father vanished from the deck of the Lady Ghislaine off the Canary Islands and his body was later found floating in the sea.
Ghislaine Maxwell flew straight to Las Palmas, where the yacht had been taken. By every account, she was inconsolable at the loss of her father. The day after his death, she was deputed to deliver an emotional speech to the world's press, who had gathered at the quayside.
Soon enough it came out that Robert Maxwell had raided the Mirror Group's pension fund of £440m ($583m) as part of a scheme to artificially inflate the company's share price at the expense of 32,000 of his employees.
Now the Maxwell family and the British government were left to pick up the pieces - the latter eventually paying £100m ($132m) towards a bailout of the fund. In June 1992, two of Robert's sons, Ian and Kevin, were arrested and charged with fraud. They were eventually acquitted in January 1996.
While her father's guilt was obvious to most people, Ghislaine Maxwell continued to defend him. ""He wasn't a crook,"" she told Vanity Fair's Edward Klein in early 1992. ""A thief to me is somebody who steals money. Do I think that my father did that? No. I don't know what he did. Obviously, something happened. Did he put it in his own pocket? Did he run off with the money? No. And that's my definition of a crook.""
While the rest of her siblings accepted Robert Maxwell's death was either an accident or suicide, his youngest daughter insisted he must have been murdered.
Despite her protests, the fall-out from the Mirror pension scandal made the UK a less than welcoming place for her. In November 1992 it was reported that she had bought a $4,000 (£3,019) one-way Concorde ticket to New York.
In 2005, Harry Mount was feeling lonely in Manhattan. Aged 33, he'd just been appointed as the Daily Telegraph's New York correspondent but, as yet, knew few people in the city. When a friend asked him if he wanted to tag along with him to a party at Ghislaine Maxwell's house, Mount jumped at the chance. She was, after all, well known as a prominent figure in Manhattan society who'd been photographed with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and even Pope John Paul II.
Among the great and the good of US society, her cut-glass British accent and friendship with Prince Andrew marked her out as an exotic, alluring figure.
When Mount arrived at her five-storey mansion on the Upper East Side, he was astonished when she bounded towards him and began bombarding him with questions. He recalls her listening intently to his replies as though he were the most fascinating person in the world.
""There was no reason why she should have been particularly friendly to me,"" says Mount, now editor of the Oldie magazine, where he has written about their encounter. ""She could well have frozen me out while being perfectly polite.""
Mount assumed her effusiveness and charm were by-products of her troubled childhood. ""You end up with this mixture of great connections and confidence and you move among the great and the good - but fundamentally, you're not that sure of yourself,"" he says.
""And people who aren't sure of themselves are a bit nicer than those who often are.""
It was only later that Mount realised there was something he had missed. 
Ghislaine Maxwell had reportedly been left with an £80,000 ($106,000)-a-year income from a trust fund. It should have occurred to him, he later reflected, that this amount wouldn't have been nearly enough to pay for her opulent house. Years later, prosecutors would suggest the property had been funded by Jeffrey Epstein.
At that stage Mount didn't know about her connection to the well-known financier.
But before long Epstein's relationship with Maxwell would be scrutinised by every journalist in the city.
In 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police Epstein had molested their daughter, and three years later he received an 18-month prison sentence. After his release, the allegations against him began to snowball. He was accused of running a ""vast network"" of girls for sex.
He was arrested again in 2019 on charges of sex trafficking and died in his prison cell just over a month later. Inevitably the authorities' focus turned to Maxwell.
Like her father, Epstein was an enormously wealthy man from humble origins - in his case, a working-class neighbourhood in Brooklyn. Also like Robert Maxwell, he would eventually be disgraced and die of an apparent suicide in disputed circumstances.
Ghislaine Maxwell's relationship with Epstein was no doubt mutually beneficial. She could introduce him to her wealthy and powerful friends; he in turn had the capital to fund the kind of lifestyle she had grown up to expect.
During the trial, as well as emphasising the pair's closeness, prosecutors noted that Maxwell ""was not a particularly wealthy person when she met Epstein"".
Certainly, after she returned to New York in the wake her father's death, it was reported that she was working in real estate and living in a $2,000 (£1,500)-a-month apartment - a decent standard of living by any means, not least when the trust fund was taken into account, but nonetheless somewhat less than she might have been accustomed to.
But the fine details of the relationship are not easy to pin down. When it began, how long it lasted and how exactly it should be characterised were all issues of contention at the trial, which has just concluded.
Four charges in Maxwell's trial related to the period 1994-97, when the indictment stated that she was among Epstein's closest associates and also in an ""intimate relationship"" with him.
By the 2000s, she was linked with another businessman, Ted Waitt. But it appeared that she carried on working for Epstein. By the time of a 2003 profile, Epstein described Maxwell as his ""best friend"" and journalist Vicky Ward noted that much of his life appeared to be organised by her. Intimate photos of Maxwell and Epstein together released by prosecutors suggested they had remained close.
In court documents, former employees at the Epstein mansion in Palm Beach described her as the house manager who supervised staff, looked after finances and acted as a social co-ordinator.
A housekeeper testified that Maxwell gave staff a 58-page instruction manual and ordered them to speak only when spoken to, avoiding eye contact with Epstein. It's tempting to conclude that just as Maxwell learned to appease the whims of her capricious, bullying father, she applied those same skills on Epstein.
Whatever the exact nature of their relationship, the prosecution portrayed their closeness as a crucial factor in their pattern of abuse - with Ghislaine Maxwell seeking out and grooming victims for Epstein. And now she has been found guilty of five of six counts - including the most serious charge, that of sex trafficking of a minor.
""Ghislaine controlled the girls,"" Sarah Ransome, who says she was abused by Epstein, told the BBC's Panorama programme. ""She would be the one getting all the girls in check. She knew what Jeffrey liked… this was very much a joint effort.""  
In the months following Epstein's death, Maxwell went to ground. Newspapers speculated as to her whereabouts. A photograph of her outside a Los Angeles branch of In-N-Out Burger appeared on front pages around the world.
Then, in July 2020, she was arrested at her secluded mansion in the US state of New Hampshire. A few months later, it emerged to general surprise that she had married a tech CEO named Scott Borgerson.
Maxwell was held at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn. While she waited for her trial to begin, her brother Ian told the BBC's Today programme that she was being held in a 6ft by 9ft (1.8m by 2.7m) cell with a concrete bed.
""She is under 24-hour, around-the-clock surveillance, with 10 cameras, including one that moves and tracks her movement,"" he said. ""She's not allowed to move into the corners of her cell and she's not allowed to be within two and a half feet of the cell door. That is her existence.""
It was an ignominious fate for a woman who had spent most of her life surrounded by material riches. It was left to the prosecution to explain why on earth she would commit the crimes that had put her there.
Prosecutors suggested money was an incentive. The journalist John Sweeney, who explored the case in his podcast Hunting Ghislaine and is writing a book about it, suggests a deeper psychological motive was at play.
""You can't understand what happened with Jeffrey Epstein without understanding her relationship with her father,"" he says. ""The truth is that Ghislaine learned to service her father and then had to service a second monster - that's what she's done her entire life.""
Another similarity between Robert Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein is that both escaped a full reckoning for their crimes. And defence lawyers argued Ghislaine Maxwell was a scapegoat for Epstein - the age-old story of a woman taking the blame for the misdeeds of her partner.
But Pasternak dismisses the idea that Maxwell is in any way less culpable than Epstein. ""There is absolutely no way that he could have had access to that many young girls, whose lives they've obliterated, without Ghislaine,"" says the author.
While the trial was under way, Ian Maxwell wrote an article for The Spectator putting across his sister's defence. It began with a reprimand to the media corps.
They'd been pronouncing her name inaccurately, he said. It wasn't ""Jizlaine"". Instead, he insisted, it was ""Giilen"".
For anyone following the case, it seemed remarkable that such a basic detail had been so consistently wrong. This was a woman, after all, who had lived her entire life in the news pages and gossip columns.
But as the trial progressed it became apparent that so much that had been assumed about her - her relationship status at any one time, the source of her income, and, quite often, her whereabouts - were likely not as they seemed.
Her crimes surely defy explanation, too. And for all that her rise and fall were conducted in public, Ghislaine Maxwell remains unknowable.

67;How Russia tries to censor Western social media;['2021-12-17T01:13:12.000Z'];['By Andrei Zakharov and Ksenia Churmanova'];['social media', 'google', 'russia', 'meta', 'instagram', 'twitter', 'facebook', 'censorship'];['tries', 'russia', 'western', 'territory', 'censor', 'users', 'twitter', 'store', 'pressure', 'russian', 'social', 'media', 'start', 'companies'];"
Google and Meta face the threat of multi-million-dollar fines for failing to delete content that the Russian government considers illegal - but a close look at court papers reveals these are often simply posts about protests in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
In the summer of 2018, a Russian poet writing under the pseudonym Siberian Viking posted a caricature on his Facebook account. It showed the double-headed eagle of the Russian coat of arms, with the bird's heads replaced by faces of President Vladimir Putin and the then-prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev. 
Alongside it was a short poem, alleging that the eagle was twice as greedy as others, lied twice as much and carried out surveillance with four eyes. It ended with an emotional cry: ""When will Russians awaken to remove this contagion?""
The Russian government told Facebook to remove the post because of its ""blatant disrespect towards the state, the constitution and the president of the Russian Federation"". Facebook did not comply, and the post featured in one of more than 60 lawsuits launched against Western social media in Russia this year, resulting in fines of more than $2m. 
It's not clear how many of the fines have actually been paid. But the cases highlight the difficulty of operating in a country where restrictions are placed on freedom of speech and political activity - most notably the ruling in June this year that the Anti-Corruption Foundation headed by jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny is an ""extremist"" organisation, on a par with the Taliban or the Islamic State group.
According to the head of media regulator Roskomnadzor, Andrei Lipov, social media companies are obliged to find and remove ""the most dangerous things"", which he listed in an interview with the Kommersant newspaper as ""child pornography, suicide, drugs, extremism and fake news"".
But a close examination of the roughly 400 posts listed in court proceedings against Google, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter reveals that just nine concern child abuse or drugs, and only 12 refer to suicide. The overwhelming majority are calls to attend pro-Navalny demonstrations.
""Neither Roskomnadzor nor the Kremlin wants to say that Russia has political censorship,"" says Sarkis Darbinian, a legal expert at freedom-of-speech pressure group Roskomsvoboda. Commenting on the emphasis placed on child protection in official statements, he says: ""To explain to the broad masses why this struggle is necessary, they exploit the tears of a child.""
Roskomnadzor, the media regulator, didn't respond to the BBC's request for comment, but President Putin's press spokesman has previously said that actions taken against social media companies are not censorship, but simply attempts to enforce Russian law. 
Pressure on social media companies dates back to 2015, when a law came into force obliging them to store the personal data of Russian users on Russian territory and giving the government the power to fine them, or close them down, for not doing so. None of the Western companies have complied, which led to the closure of LinkedIn in 2016. Google, Meta and Twitter have collectively been fined more than $600,000 since the start of 2020.
It was in 2016 that requests from the Russian government to Google to remove videos from YouTube and to block certain search results began to rapidly increase. The company's transparency reports show that over the last 10 years it has received more such requests from Russia than the rest of the world combined - Google says a third of them relate to ""national security"".
Like the other Western companies, Google complies with some Russian requests but not with others.
Efforts to control the spread of undesirable information on social media accelerated further in early 2021, after the return of Alexei Navalny to Russia from hospital in Germany, where he had been treated for poisoning with the chemical weapon Novichok.
Navalny was immediately arrested, leading to unsanctioned protests in Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities, which supporters widely advertised on social media.
This prompted angry complaints from Roskomnadzor. The posts were quickly removed from the third most popular social network in Russia, VKontakte (or VK.com), owned at that point by oligarch Alisher Usmanov, the former Arsenal football club shareholder. 
But Western social networks were less accommodating, so Roskomnadzor started taking them to court and fining them.
Its next step, in March, was to slow down traffic on Twitter, for its refusal to delete these and other posts. Pictures and videos, in particular, became slower to load. 
And later in the year it persuaded Google and Apple to remove from their stores a tactical voting app, designed to help Navalny sympathisers unite behind a single candidate in local elections, thereby maximising the chance of defeating the candidate of the ruling United Russia party.
The head of Navalny's team, Ivan Zhdanov, denounced the companies for what he described as ""a shameful act of political censorship"".
He later tweeted part of a letter from Apple, which pointed out that prosecutors had said the app was enabling illegal ""interference in elections"" and that media regulator Roskomnadzor had warned the company that it was promoting an ""extremist organisation"". 
The BBC asked to interview Apple, Google, Meta and Twitter, but Google and Twitter declined to comment, and Apple and Meta didn't respond. 
Roskomnadzor claims some success in getting posts deleted, as well as the voting app. 
In May it partially reversed the action taken to slow down Twitter, claiming that the company had deleted 91% of a list of 5,900 tweets. Now it's only on mobile internet devices that pictures and videos on Twitter continue to load slowly.
Tweets that Twitter deletes after being fined for refusing to do so are generally only deleted for Russian users - they nearly always remain visible to users outside the country.
One of the tweets mentioned in court documents was a quote-tweet sent in January by a young activist called Alexei, relaying information about a pro-Navalny protest planned for the following Saturday in Nizhny Novgorod - a city on the Volga River, east of Moscow. 
As the city's authorities hadn't approved the demonstration, Alexei chose his words carefully, describing the location as ""the place you mustn't go"". He added, ""Putin really doesn't want you to go there, so don't!""
But the irony wasn't enough to stop Roskomnadzor taking Twitter to court, and Twitter eventually deleted the tweet.
Now, for Russian users, this tweet has been replaced by a message in English explaining that the message ""has been withheld in Russia in response to a legal demand.""
Elsewhere in the world, the tweet still appears as normal.
Alexei says he hadn't been informed that his tweet was being withdrawn, and only realised when he was contacted by the BBC. He expressed surprise that the original tweet about the protest - the one he retweeted - was still visible.
By contrast Alexander, a political activist in the town of Kostroma, north-west of Moscow, did get a message when his tweet about a Navalny protest was removed. His VK.com post on the same subject also vanished, but although Facebook contacted him to say the authorities had complained about his post on that network, ultimately they didn't remove it.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, does delete some content, though.
In the first half of 2021, it removed 1,800 pieces of content on Facebook or Instagram, at the request of Russian authorities. In its transparency report the company categorised half of these as ""items related to extremism"". It didn't say how many times it had refused the government's requests. 
Google's transparency report also notes that it has deleted content - either search results, or YouTube videos - following objections from the Russian authorities. However it now complies with more of these requests than in the past. Only 8% were rejected in the first half of 2021, down from 50% in the same period of 2019. 
Russia has the technical means to block the operations of the social media companies, and laws that could provide a justification. 
They can be legally blocked for not storing the personal data of Russian users in Russia, or for refusing to delete harmful content - and from next year it will be possible to block them for not having an office in the country. So far only Google has one (though the company describes it as a ""legal entity"" rather than an office).
YouTube is currently being threatened with being blocked in return for shutting down channels used by the Kremlin-funded RT news outlet in Germany.
However at the end of last year, Russia also introduced new higher penalties for failure to delete illegal content, and in court cases due to take place on 24 December both Google and Meta face a possible fine of up to 10% of their annual revenue in Russia.
""This motivates the platforms,"" Roskomnadzor boss Andrei Lipov told Kommersant. ""We haven't yet resorted to these fines, but we will."" 
Meta has not disclosed its Russian revenue, but Google's last year was at least $1bn, opening the way to a possible fine of $100m in its case.
A former Roskomnadzor official, who asked not to be named, told the BBC these new fines enable the Russian authorities to hit the Western companies where it hurts. And he says he is sure they will.
Correction 21st December: An earlier version of this article reported that the BBC team had examined more than 600 posts listed in court proceedings against Google, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. In fact they looked at roughly 400 posts and this line has been amended.

A giant European Union flag displayed at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to mark France taking on the bloc's presidency has been removed after it was criticised by right-wing politicians.
Far-right leader Marine Le Pen said ""replacing"" the French flag at the monument was an attack on the country's identity. 
A government minister said the move was only ever meant to be temporary.
France has taken over the EU's rotating presidency for the next six months.
Ms Le Pen, who is a candidate in the presidential election in April, had vowed to file a complaint with the State Council, France's highest court for administrative matters. She described the EU flag's removal as a victory resulting from pressure on the government.
Far-right independent candidate Eric Zemmour, who is also running against President Emmanuel Macron, called it ""an outrage"".
Conservative candidate Valérie Pécresse also objected to the position of the EU flag: ""Preside over Europe yes, erase French identity no!"", she tweeted:
But European Affairs Minister Clément Beaune denied the government had bowed to pressure from the far right and said the flag had been taken down as planned.
""It was scheduled that the flag was to be taken down this Sunday, we hadn't established an exact time,"" he told France Inter radio.
Mr Beaune also pointed out that the French flag which is sometimes displayed at the Arc de Triomphe is not a permanent fixture there.
On Saturday, Mr Macron, who has not yet said whether he will run for re-election in April, outlined the priorities of France's EU presidency based on three principles: strengthening European sovereignty, developing a new model of growth, and creating a Europe closer to its citizens. 
Specific goals included better border protection and management of migration, improved security, technological innovation, and defending the rule of law, he added.
Other landmarks in the capital and other French cities will be lit up in blue for the rest of the week to highlight France's EU presidency, including:

69;Covid: Israel Omicron spike could bring herd immunity but with risks - health boss;['2022-01-02T18:24:31.000Z'];['BBC News'];['israel', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['particularly', 'saw', 'bring', 'boss', 'covid', 'past', 'risks', 'website', 'ynet', 'told', 'health', 'zarka', 'mr', 'omicron', 'recovered', 'herd', 'reinfected', 'israel', 'spike', 'immunity'];"
Israel's top health adviser says the surge of Omicron cases could see the country reach Covid herd immunity.
Nachmann Ash said the country would pay a price for this and he wanted to see herd immunity achieved via vaccinations instead.
Modellers have warned that up to four million people could be infected by the end of January.
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has admitted his current policy will not prevent a big rise in infections.
On Sunday, he said a fourth Covid-19 vaccine would be offered to people over 60 as well as medical staff.
The prime minister has previously insisted the aim is to prevent a spike in serious illness while keeping the economy open, even though he has not ruled out another lockdown.
Confirmed daily infections in Israel have quadrupled to more than 3,500 in 10 days, but the number of deaths has not seen a similar rise.
Herd immunity is a scientific term describing the point at which a population is protected from a disease, either by enough people being vaccinated or by people having developed antibodies by having the disease.
Prof Ash said a surge in Omicron cases was inevitable.
""The price of herd immunity is very many infections, and that may end up happening. The numbers need to be high to reach herd immunity, it's something that is possible,"" he said.
""But we don't want to reach it by means of infections, we want it to happen as a result of many people vaccinating.""
Salman Zarka, head of the health ministry's coronavirus taskforce, said herd immunity was not guaranteed.
""We have to be very cautious with this particularly in light of our experience over the past two years in which we saw people who have recovered be re-infected,"" Mr Zarka told the Ynet news website.
Meanwhile another government adviser, Eran Segal from the Weizmann Institute, warned that cases would soon outstrip Israel's testing capacity, leaving the country unable to identify new infections.
He predicted that between two and four million people would be infected over the coming three weeks - but that a lower number of people would suffer severe illness than in the previous wave.
He urged people to get vaccinated.
""Everyone who walks around, no matter where, will be exposed and should be protected,"" he tweeted.
About two-thirds of Israel's population of more than nine million have been fully vaccinated, which the health ministry defines as having either had a third dose or recently had a second dose.
However many of those eligible for a third dose have not yet had one.
Israel has already approved a fourth vaccine dose for immuno-compromised people and the elderly in care homes.
Meanwhile just over a quarter of Palestinians have been fully vaccinated, according to Our World In Data.
The Palestinians have received vaccine doses from Israel, Russia, China, the United Arab Emirates and the global Covax vaccine-sharing initiative.
UN experts had been critical of Israel's failure to fully extend its vaccination programme to Palestinians under its control.
The Israelis said the Palestinians were responsible for managing health matters in the Palestinian Territories.

70;Covid: Workplaces told to plan for absences of up to 25%;['2022-01-02T15:24:09.000Z'];['By Becky Morton'];['schools', 'public sector', 'cabinet office', 'nhs', 'self-isolation', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['begins', 'workplaces', 'test', 'plan', 'selfisolation', 'positive', 'uk', 'absences', 'systems', 'whichever', 'reasoning', '25', 'covid', 'symptoms', 'told', 'receives'];"
Ministers have been tasked with developing ""robust contingency plans"" for workplace absences, as the government warned rising cases could see up to a quarter of staff off work. 
Public sector leaders have been asked to prepare for ""worst case scenarios"" of 10%, 20% and 25% absence rates, the Cabinet Office said. 
The UK has seen record numbers of daily cases over the festive period. 
Transport, the NHS and schools have already seen the effect of absences.
Rising case numbers have led to large numbers self-isolating and being unable to go to work. This has particularly affected industries where staff are unable to work from home.
Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay is chairing regular meetings with ministers to assess how the spread of the Omicron variant is affecting workforces and supply chains, the Cabinet Office said.
The prime minister had asked ministers working with their respective sectors to test preparations and contingency plans to limit disruption, it explained. 
Mr Barclay said the highly transmissible Omicron variant meant businesses and public services ""will face disruption in the coming weeks, particularly from higher than normal staff absence"". 
However, his department said that so far disruption caused by Omicron has been controlled in ""most parts of the public sector"".
People who test positive for Covid must self-isolate for at least seven days in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Two negative lateral flow results, 24-hours apart, are required to end self-isolation - the first no earlier than day six. 
In Scotland, positive cases must isolate for the full 10 days. 
Unvaccinated contacts of positive cases must also isolate for 10 days in all parts of the UK.
Some have called for a US-style self-isolation system to be introduced, where people only have to quarantine for five days, but the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said doing so would be counterproductive and could actually worsen staff shortages if it led to more people being infected.
Explaining its reasoning in a blog post, it said the two systems were not like-for-like. In the UK, the self-isolation ""clock"" begins when the person experiences symptoms or receives a positive test - whichever is first. But in the US, self-isolation begins only after a positive test - which may be some days after symptoms first appear.
On day six, the UKHSA says its modelling suggests 10-30% of people will still be infectious, depending on how quickly they get their test result after developing symptoms.
It says ending self-isolation after seven days with two negative lateral flow tests gives a similar level of protection to self-isolating for 10 days, when 5% of people will still be infectious. 
Ian Wilson, owner and director of Bellcare, a Cumbria-based firm that provides in-home help for the elderly and disabled, is concerned that those who need care aren't going to get it - simply because there aren't enough people to provide it.
""The amount of people requiring care in the first place means that you're generally run off your feet,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC. ""As soon as you start losing staff [because of Omicron], it gets really, really awkward.""
While Bellcare has been able to bring forward an increase in the National Living Wage from April to now, thanks to a government grant, ""if the people don't come forward it is really difficult,"" said Mr Wilson.
Mr Wilson's firm employs around 120 people and could easily find hours for an additional 40 or 50 carers. 
""We've got the Brexit thing as well where we had overseas workers,"" said Mr Wilson. ""We can apply for licences to recruit overseas workers but that is a lengthy and quite costly process to be honest so it is not going to solve anything next week.""
Mr Wilson said: ""I don't know what the government plans are for contingencies. We can only work with what we've got and those people that we've got can only work so many hours a day, so yes, it is going to be difficult.""
The situation will be kept under review, the the UKHSA says, but it believes current rules are the ""optimal approach at present"".
In December, the education secretary urged retired teachers to return to classrooms to help with Covid-related staff shortages in the new year. 
Some schools had to close early or move to online learning before the end of last term because of staff absences. 
And several train operators have had to reduce services because of staff absences. 
Rising cases are also affecting the NHS, with 24,632 staff at hospital trusts ill with coronavirus or self-isolating on 26 December, up 31% on the previous week and nearly double the figure at the start of the month, according to NHS England. 
Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Boris Johnson should have told ministers to start planning for workplace absences weeks ago. 
""Boris Johnson's lack of leadership means his government has dithered and delayed, leaving contingency planning to the very last moment,"" she said. 
""With record Covid infection numbers, the prime minister must immediately get a grip on workforce pressures, keep essential services moving, keep schools open and keep people safe.""
Businesses say this proposal from government is welcome, but they would like to see more detail of what contingency planning for mass staff absences might mean in practice.
Bosses also question where they will draw more staff from if their teams become ill.
Russell Norman had to close his popular restaurant Brutto in London prior to the New Year after his workforce plummeted from 24 people to just five in the week before Christmas, as staff fell ill with Omicron. 
He says that since Brexit, ""there just are not pools of enthusiastic people waiting in the wings who are available for restaurant work"". 
There's another worry too.  
Others in the hospitality sector say that many of their staff are on zero hours contracts and, as a result of falling consumer confidence and venues deciding to close in the last three weeks, have seen their hours cut dramatically. 
With symptoms mild, industry leaders say they believe some will continue to work, even if positive.
England reported 162,572 new cases on Saturday - a record number for the fifth day in a row - and Covid hospital admissions are at their highest level since January 2021.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland did not report figures on Saturday. 
England is currently under Plan B restrictions, which includes mandatory masks in most indoor public places, Covid passes for nightclubs and other large venues and guidance to work from home if possible. 
The measures are set to expire six weeks after implementation - 26 January, with a review after three weeks, which is expected on or close to 4 January. 
Other parts of the UK have already introduced tougher restrictions for hospitality venues. 
Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said any additional restrictions in England ""must be an absolute last resort"".

71;Wales-Ireland walking route to celebrate Celtic links;['2022-01-02T07:06:05.000Z'];['By Aled Scourfield'];['tourism', 'eco-tourism', 'walking', 'travel & leisure industry', 'aberystwyth university', 'christianity', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['rosslare', 'pilgrimage', 'world', 'used', 'm4', 'celtic', 'walesireland', 'celebrate', 'links', 'walking', 'route', 'setting', 'wexford', 'irish', 'sea'];"
The shared religious and cultural history of Wales and Ireland is being celebrated with two pilgrimage routes in each nation.
The Ancient Connections project will see two routes in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, and Ferns, County Wexford, linked via a ferry service.
It is hoped the routes will boost green tourism after the Covid-19 pandemic.
The aim is to attract about 5,000 people a year, whether they are keen walkers or making a pilgrimage.
The five-year project is being sponsored by Pembrokeshire and Wexford councils, and is also backed by European funding. 
The nations are linked by the close bond that grew between St David, the patron saint of Wales, and St Aidan of Ferns during the early medieval period.
Pembrokeshire is also littered with sites which are notable for their importance to early Christianity and in medieval times it was said that two pilgrimages to St Davids was equivalent to one pilgrimage to Rome. 
It is believed that St David was born at the site of St Non's Chapel, Pembrokeshire, named after his mother, in the 6th Century. There is a holy well at the site which reputedly has healing powers. 
St Aidan is said to have travelled from Wexford to Pembrokeshire to study under St David. 
According to academics, there is clear evidence they were close.
""Welsh and Irish sources agree that was a close relationship between them and Aidan was a disciple of St David,"" said Dr Simon Rodway, who lectures in Welsh and Celtic Studies at Aberystwyth University.
""It's clear that Aidan did spend some time in Wales with St David, and then he returned to Ireland where he was gifted lands at Ferns in County Wexford, where he founded a monastery.""
The new routes will recreate the journeys followed by St Aidan and St David. 
John G O'Dwyer, chairman of Pilgrim Paths Ireland and author of Irish Pilgrim Paths, said the potential of the trails was ""absolutely huge"".
""We have quite a few pilgrim paths in Ireland but this is the first one that will recognise the fact that for the Irish, in the early medieval period, pilgrimage overseas was a very important thing,"" he said.
""It will have the added appeal of walking in two countries and at the same time, not having a particularly long walk. 
""It's a Celtic nation and I think the more and more we look at our own identity, the Irish recognise a special affinity with the Scots, with the Welsh, the Cornish and the Bretons. 
""I see a huge potential, particularly now as countries like Wales are, in the way we have 100 years ago, expressing their own independence and getting closer to a much more independent Welsh state, I think there will be a lot of interest.""
Holiday firm Journeying specialises in running pilgrimages and is a partner in the scheme, and its director Iain Tweedale said: ""It'll probably be called the Way of St Aidan and David. 
""St Aidan was a protégé of St David... and St David would visit Ireland. 
""They used the Irish Sea as the M4 of their day. We're setting up a new pilgrimage route that goes from Ferns in County Wexford, which is the ancient capital of that part of the world, it then heads down the coast to Rosslare.
""People can then jump on the ferry and come over to Fishguard. 
""We then walk from Fishguard down to St Davids. It's about 130km (about 81 miles) in total.""
It is hoped the extra visitors will boost local businesses during quieter times of the year.
""We've got a five-year plan to make this quite a significant path,"" added Mr Tweedale. ""We expect within five years there's going to around 4,000-5,000 on the path every year. On the Camino in Spain, there are 250,000 every year. 
He added that they did not wish to reach those numbers in St Davids but it was a form of green tourism as people arrived on foot and would use public transport from start to finish.
According to the British Pilgrimage Trust, pilgrimages have become increasingly popular, even for those who are not religious.
Guy Hayward, director of the trust, said: ""Before Covid hit, I was talking to travel journalists who write for the top end travel and fashion magazines and they were saying that no-fly travel was coming.
""Covid brought that forward. It's tourism without the cars. Even before Covid, there was a move towards finding new meaning and that got sped up.""
He said the new route could provide a welcome boost for tourism businesses in Wexford and Pembrokeshire.
""The average daily spend by a pilgrim is 42 euros, which is 2.3 times more than what the average tourist gives to the local community.""
Not-for-profit travel company Guided Pilgrimage shares the view that the new routes will also attract a wider demographic. 
Director Christine Smith said: ""It attracts people from all walks of life. Particularly people who are questioning or they are at a crossroads in their life. 
""Maybe they're coming out of a marriage, and during their time on pilgrimage they have time away from their normal lives to relax, see life from a different perspective. 
""It's the healing power of being outside.""

72;Memorial: Russia’s civil rights group uncovering an uncomfortable past;['2022-01-02T14:42:02.000Z'];['BBC News'];['joseph stalin', 'soviet union', 'russia', 'moscow'];['grandfather', 'russia', 'uncovering', 'past', 'great', 'grandson', 'memorial', 'havent', 'uncomfortable', 'started', 'civil', 'rights', 'russias', 'group', 'respect', 'human'];"
The closure of Memorial, one of the oldest civil rights groups in Russia, caused an outcry in the country and around the world.
It had been prominent in uncovering the crimes of the Stalinist regime and remembering the victims of the Gulag. But the authorities accused the organisation of trying to undermine the state order. 
BBC Russian looks at what made Memorial so important.
For over 30 years, Memorial worked on uncovering the fates of the victims of Soviet political repressions. It also exposed human rights abuses in present-day Russia.
Its work never sat comfortably with the authorities. It was initially cautioned in 2006, and in 2014 it was added to the list of ""foreign agents"" - a roster of organisations and individuals the government claims receive funding from abroad.
The label is a poignant reminder of the 1930s mass repressions in the USSR [Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]. Then, many victims were wrongfully accused of being foreign agents, traitors and enemies of the people. 
It is ironic that Memorial, an organisation finding out what happened to those accused of being foreign agents nearly a century ago, ended up with the same label.
A pretext for closing the group was its failure to mark some of its social media posts with a ""foreign agent"" disclaimer, which it is legally required to do. 
Memorial's lawyer Tatyana Glushkova stresses the group marked most of its posts and online pages as required and paid fines when it failed to do so. 
The group and its supporters say the accusation was just a formal excuse to close down an organisation voicing uncomfortable truths.
Memorial was set up in 1987 - at the time of reforms introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev's Perestroika - and initially led by Andrei Sakharov, a famous Soviet dissident scientist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
Sakharov and those in his circle wanted to focus on uncovering the true scale of the repression which took place under Josef Stalin - Soviet leader between 1929 and 1953. During this period tens of millions of people are believed to have perished in the Gulag forced labour camps.
In 1990, a Memorial team travelled to the Solovky camp in the north of Russia - formerly one of the most notorious in the Gulag. They brought back a memorial stone to be placed in central Moscow. 
The Solovetsky stone now sits in the Lubyanka square, opposite the imposing building of the Russian security service, the FSB, (formerly NKVD and later the KGB). It is meant to serve as a reminder of Russia's grim history.
Memorial also investigated more recent human rights abuses in Russia and other post-Soviet countries. A centre for human rights was created as a separate arm of the organisation in 1991. It has been providing legal and other assistance to those considered to be political prisoners and their families. 
Yan Rachinskiy, the chairman of Memorial, says it's ironic that the organisation is being liquidated in the year of Andrei Sakharov's centenary. 
Sasha Lavut, 15, is one of the youngest Memorial volunteers. He started two years ago, handing out flyers and candles in the street at the annual commemoration for victims of the Soviet repressions. Later he began to look after the group's Tik Tok account and other social media platforms. 
Sasha is named after his great grandfather, Alexander Lavut, a former political prisoner and one of the editors of A chronicle of Current Events, a prominent Soviet underground publication, which detailed human rights abuses in the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s.
Alexander spent seven years in prison and then in exile for his activism, before joining Memorial.
""If we haven't achieved what he was fighting for - respect for human rights in Russia - then we have to keep going with what was started under far more difficult circumstances,"" says his great grandson. ""I see Memorial as a part of my great grandfather and therefore a part of me.""
Roman Petrishchev, 29, who had dreamed of working in a human rights group since university, joined Memorial in 2020 as a member of staff and calls it ""a dream job"". 
He was distraught to learn the organisation would have to close. 
His colleague Natasha Sekretareva, also 29, has been at Memorial since February and feels the same: ""It's the best job I've ever had, with the best people. I have finally found my community.""
Both Roman and Natasha work for the human rights arm of the organisation, which means that they don't research past repressions but help those it describes as Russia's current political prisoners. 
Natasha looks after the cases Memorial takes to the European Court of Human Rights.
Amnesty International's Marie Struthers described the decision to shut down Memorial as ""a grave insult to victims of the Gulag"". 
""Memorial was created at the time of Perestroika when it seemed that the Soviet Union would never return, the arrests would never return,"" Zoya Svetova, a human rights activist and publicist, told BBC Russian. ""But now there is a feeling that all these things might come back into our life.""
History and nostalgia play a key part in Vladimir Putin's presidency. In December he lamented the collapse of the Soviet Union and the demise of what he described as ""historical Russia"". 
""What had been built up over 1,000 years was largely lost,"" he said. 
Russia's role in World War Two has been recently included in the country's constitution and ""spreading falsehoods about the activities of the USSR"" in the war can be punished with fines or even imprisonment.
Yet, repressions of the Soviet era, while not openly condoned, have not been officially examined.
Memorial's supporters say that the organisation has been uncovering parts of Russian history which current authorities don't want exposed as they don't fit into the patriotic narrative. 
""Those who have studied the past of their families and have seen the Soviet archives, are likely to continue to be resistant to the myths of the 'lost Soviet paradise',"" says lawyer Daniil Petrov.
He believes the work of Memorial has provided ""an inoculation against propaganda"".
Olga is one of those who came to support Memorial during the final court hearing and was heartbroken to find out that it would have to close. 
""My grandfather was executed in 1937. I was never able to find out exactly what he was accused of. Memorial would have been the only place which could have helped me. Now that hope is gone.""

Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has resigned after another day of mass protests rocked the capital Khartoum.
Thousands marched against a recent deal he had done to share power with the army, who staged a coup in October.
Chanting ""power to the people"", protesters called for a return to full civilian rule. But military forces staged another violent crackdown, leaving two people dead.
Mr Hamdok's decision to quit leaves the army in full control of government.
It is another blow to Sudan's fragile attempts at a transition to democratic rule after a popular uprising led to the overthrow of Sudan's long-term authoritarian President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. 
In a televised address, Mr Hamdok said the country was at a ""dangerous turning point that threatens its whole survival"". 
He said he had tried his best to stop the country from ""sliding towards disaster"", but that ""despite everything that has been done to reach a consensus... it has not happened"".
Civilian and military leaders had made an uneasy power-sharing agreement after the army staged a coup on 25 October and initially placed Prime Minister Hamdok under house arrest.
Under the agreement reached with Mr Hamdok in November, the reinstated prime minister was supposed to lead a cabinet of technocrats until elections were held. But it was unclear how much power the new civilian government would have, and protesters said they did not trust the military.
Thousands of people were on the streets of the capital Khartoum and the city of Omdurman on Sunday, chanting and calling on the military to leave politics alone. 
On social media, activists have said 2022 will be ""the year of the continuation of the resistance"".
More than 50 people have been killed at protests since the coup, including at least two on Sunday, according to the pro-democracy Sudan Central Doctors' Committee. 
Coup leader Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has defended last October's coup, saying the army had acted to prevent a civil war that was threatening to erupt. He says Sudan is still committed to the transition to civilian rule, with elections planned for July 2023.
January 1 marked Sudan's Independence Day but there's little to celebrate in the country at the moment. 
The resignation of PM Abdalla Hamdok is a big blow to the military leaders who had thought an agreement with Mr Hamdok would appease protesters and legitimize their stay in power. 
Clearly those calculations were wrong. But it means the army are now firmly in power, reversing gains made as the country attempted to return to civilian rule. 
The current political crisis now threatens to return Sudan to the authoritarian years of former ousted leader Omar al-Bashir.  
And there's also the risk that the country could go back to being a pariah state with the likes of the US already indicating that they would sanction those impeding a return to civilian rule. 
Given Sudan's economic struggles, that could have an even worse effect on the lives of Sudanese people.

75;Viewpoint: How Sudan's generals betrayed my generation;['2021-11-20T00:48:23.000Z'];['BBC News'];['sudan crisis', 'sudan'];['tries', 'power', 'mounting', 'movement', 'place', 'generals', 'generation', 'resistance', 'london', 'viewpoint', 'prodemocracy', 'sudans', 'turmoil', 'betrayed', 'took'];"
In our series of letters from African writers, former BBC journalist Mohanad Hashim - who had returned to live in Sudan after the 2019 revolution - says the hopes of many have been scuppered following the army's recent seizure of power.
I was supposed to be flying back to Khartoum this week to continue my duties as a member of staff at the Sudan National Broadcasting Corporation (SNBC) - I had started work at the national broadcaster in August last year.
Having lived in exile since I was 19, the opportunity to go and work in a Sudan free of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir was a dream come true - answering a deep yearning to help build my childhood home.
But last month's coup has thrown my life into disarray. 
It took place when I was on leave in London to see family - and now I find myself without a job and my homeland is in turmoil as the junta tries to consolidate its grip on power in the face of mounting resistance from a pro-democracy movement.
There is a prevailing sense of betrayal among those I have managed to speak to back home.
Many Sudanese remember the massacre of 3 June 2019 at the sit-in protest site outside the army's headquarters in the capital. 
The thousands gathered were demanding that the military hand over power to civilians - the generals had ousted President Bashir two months earlier after weeks of mass protests against him.
But on that day in June, the security forces moved in on the protesters and at least 87 people were killed
There is a lingering sense of injustice two years on - and the coup is seen as the second time army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has reneged on his promises and turned against the people.
Many I know are angry at what is seen as a brazen, self-serving act by the military's top brass. 
While the takeover was not unexpected - there had been tensions between military and civilian leaders who had been sharing power since August 2019 -  the timing was daring, and seen as an insult.
Only four days before the coup, millions had marched across the country in support of civilian rule - something that was featured prominently on the national broadcaster.
But on the morning of 25 October, an armed army unit took over the SNBC office in Omdurman, the city across the River Nile from Khartoum, and patriotic music was played.
Former generals and security officers took to the airwaves to justify the move, saying the measures were to rescue the revolution and correct its path.
For the next few days, two officers ran the national broadcaster. A brigadier was in charge of the TV arm and a colonel in charge of radio. 
Then former Bashir-era SNBC director Ibrahim al-Buzaee was reinstated. 
Colleagues tell me loyalists of Bashir's old ruling party - the National Congress - have also been brought back.
They are known for their Islamist leanings and had been expelled from the corporation by the committee responsible for dismantling the Bashir regime.
Some members of staff have been suspended - accused of loyalty to the government of the ousted civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who remains under house arrest.
Others say they have been subjected to verbal abuse and ridicule for siding with the so-called seculars, a label used by the pro-coup voices to criticise Mr Hamdok and members of his civilian cabinet.
Editorially, all efforts to change the decades-long traditions have been rolled back: SNBC is once again the mouthpiece of the regime.
Watching Sudan TV these days, you would not notice any difference in tone from the days of Bashir. 
A new studio equipped with an LED video wall - paid for by USAid to foster an open media and encourage pluralist views - is now being used by putschists to spread their propaganda.
I was part of efforts to attract Sudan's nascent creative talent to collaborate and open the gates of the national broadcaster so it could reflect a new Sudan. 
But after weeks of an internet blackout, the repression and arrest of journalists, the closure of newspapers and FM stations, the suspension of the BBC's and RFI's local FM relays and the enactment of laws to curb the freedom of anti-coup voices, this dream seems lost.
Yet pro-democracy activists have not given up.
In my neighbourhood in Omdurman, young volunteers run local service committees that ensure essentials such as bread, sugar and cooking gas are available.
It is these resistance committees that have become the pro-democracy movement organisers, mobilising residents in their areas.
They arrange mass demonstrations, neighbourhood rallies, vigils and erect barricades to stand against the military.
Those under the age of 30 make up around 65% of Sudan's population - a majority of whom want their voices heard despite attempts to silence them.

76;Sudan coup: A really simple guide;['2021-10-25T15:11:05.000Z'];['BBC News'];['sudan crisis', 'sudan'];['street', 'overstep', 'tried', 'suspect', 'pulled', 'guide', 'mobilised', 'sudan', 'coup', 'newshour', 'simple', 'really', 'told', 'mark', 'military'];"
The coup taking place in Sudan, where the prime minister and his cabinet have been arrested and the government dissolved, is the latest crisis in a turbulent period for the country. 
On top of the political tensions, Sudan's economy has been in a deep crisis, with high inflation and shortages of food, fuel and medicine. 
The coup has alarmed many international powers who have only recently been forging relations with Sudan after years of isolation. 
Here is what you need to know.
Military and civilian leaders have been sharing power since August 2019 after Sudan's long-term authoritarian President Omar al-Bashir was overthrown.
Bashir was toppled by the military but mass street demonstrations demanding civilian rule forced the military to negotiate a plan aimed at moving to a democratic government.
The country is now supposed to be in that transition, with civilians and military leaders running the country together on a joint committee known as the Sovereign Council.
But the two groups have been publicly at odds. 
Military leaders in the transitional government have demanded reforms from their civilian counterparts and called for the cabinet to be replaced. This was dismissed as a power grab by civilian leaders.
There have been several failed coups since 2019, the most recent of them just last month. 
The top civilian figure, Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok, blamed Bashir loyalists - many of whom are said to be embedded in the military, security services and other state institutions.
And recent weeks saw pro-army demonstrators bussed into the capital Khartoum, as well as large spontaneous counter-protests backing the prime minister.
The pro-military protesters accused the government of failing to revive the country's fortunes. 
Mr Hamdok's moves to reform the economy - including slashing fuel subsidies - have been unpopular with some.
Sudan's political frailty has a long precedent.
In previous decades the splintering of political parties and their inability to build consensus has time and again paved the way for the military to step in, mounting coups under the pretext of restoring order - as regional analyst Magdi Abdelhadi writes.
Today in Sudan, there are at least 80 political parties. 
This same factionalism plagued the Sovereign Council, where internal divisions among both the military and civilian camps pushed political consensus yet further out of reach.
The head of the Sovereign Council has given a speech announcing a state of emergency and dissolving both the cabinet and the council.
Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan also said elections would be held in July 2023.
Prime Minister Hamdok was reportedly detained by soldiers earlier in the day, along with several other ministers. It also appears that the state TV and radio headquarters have been taken over by the military.
The internet has also been restricted.
The African Union, the UN and the EU, as well as the Arab League and the US, have expressed deep concern over Monday's coup.
The coup is not necessarily a ""done deal"", suggests Africa analyst Alex de Waal, given Sudan's ""tremendous capacity for civic mobilisation"". 
Whenever the military has tried to overstep the mark ""the street mobilised and pulled them back - and I suspect that is what we are going to see now"", he told BBC Newshour.
According to the information ministry's Facebook page, the prime minister has called on people to come out in support of the government.
Pictures and reports coming out of Khartoum show demonstrators out in the city.
The military have also been deployed to restrict movements.
In June 2019, before the democratic transition was agreed, soldiers opened fire on protesters in Khartoum killing at least 87 people.
Memories of that massacre will be playing on the minds of people as the two sides confront each other.

77;Sudan coup protesters: 'They cannot kill us all';['2021-11-07T00:26:09.000Z'];['By Andrew Harding'];['sudan crisis', 'sudan'];['let', 'sticks', 'mercilessly', 'justice', 'sudan', 'protesters', 'coup', 'freedom', 'protest', 'peace', 'uniforms', 'went', 'kill', 'provide'];"
A fortnight after Sudan's turbulent transition to democracy was hijacked by a military coup, the streets of the capital, Khartoum, remain clogged with makeshift barricades. 
In most places, the bricks and burnt tyres have now been pulled back to allow traffic to pass - as neighbourhoods wait to see if tense, behind-the-scenes political negotiations can unravel the coup.
But there is a widespread belief here that the roadblocks, the protests, and the army's violent response, could flare up at any moment.
""There is no way out but dialogue and negotiation,"" said Suleima Elkhalifa, who headed a unit in the transitional government tasked with protecting women and children from violence. 
""But people are more determined now. And more politically aware. After 30 years of military dictatorship, we will not submit. The youth represent more than 50% of this country and it's clear we don't want this government. They cannot kill us all. They cannot kill this dream,"" she said.
There appears to be broad support for Abdalla Hamdok, the transitional prime minister who was detained by the military during the coup and remains under a form of house arrest. 
""Hamdok proved to be a man of his word - that's why people trust him [despite economic hardship],"" said Ms Elkhalifa. ""We hope that Egypt, the Saudis, and others change their minds,"" she added, referring to countries widely believed to be supportive of the coup. 
In Khartoum's private Royal Care hospital, victims of the military clampdown that followed the coup shared the same determination. 
Muhayed Faisal, an 18-year-old student, was shot twice in the leg during a recent protest.
""I was shot along with nine people. There were no warning shots, they just started to fire. The military… they're like animals. Maybe animals are better."" 
He's now had three operations on his right leg. ""Our cause didn't change - the military won't rule us,"" he said, as a doctor stroked his foot to test if any sensation had returned.
In a nearby bed, a 54-year-old tailor, Yair Mohamed Ali Abdulla, was surrounded by relatives. He'd left his shop to join the protests when the coup took place. He said he was deliberately run over by soldiers in a vehicle near Khartoum's international airport. 
""After that, five or six people beat me mercilessly with sticks on my back and chest. I just went [to the protest] to ask for freedom, peace, and justice. If the army can't provide that, they should take off their uniforms and let those who can come and take charge,"" he said.
There is speculation about the shape and fate of a possible deal between the military and the various parties and organisations involved in the transitional government that emerged from Sudan's 2019 popular revolution against long-standing leader Omar al-Bashir. 
But diplomatic and other sources in Khartoum declined to comment, citing the precarious nature of those negotiations, which are taking place under intense international pressure. 
Coup leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has said the army stepped in to avoid a civil war.
His spokesman, retired Admiral Fateh al-Rahman, told the BBC: ""Time will show that this wasn't a coup. We will put a civilian government back in place and hold elections. Then the military will step aside completely.""
One institution that was immediately shut down by the military following the coup was the transitional government's Dismantling Committee - an organisation created to seize economic assets allegedly stolen by powerful figures in the old regime.
A few months before the coup, one of the committee's senior officials, Wajdi Saleh, gave the BBC a tour of the unit, showing piles of what he said was incriminating evidence.
""These were people who organised some of the largest money-laundering operations on the planet. We are now hunting the missing billions. The old regime is trying [to thwart the revolution] but they will never succeed,"" he said. 
He was arrested during the coup, and remains in detention, along with many other influential figures in the transitional government.
""It is widely believed that recent investigations by the Dismantling Committee were causing unease among the military top brass. The committee is tracing various cases from gold smuggling to currency sales and commissions, all indicating high levels of corruption among high-ranking officers,"" said Mohanad Hashim, a former BBC journalist who had been working since the revolution for Sudan's state television.
Admiral al-Rahman said the committee had been ""using the law to create a new form of corruption"". 
""Those who stole must be held accountable. But it must be a just process.""
The blockade of a key port has been lifted since the coup - indeed it is widely suspected that the military organised the blockade to pile economic pressure on the transitional government. 
The result has been more food supplies and some lower prices in Khartoum. 
But although the coup plotters appear to have prepared the ground for their action with some care, they appear to have misread the ""street"" which appears resolute in defending the revolution despite the economic hardships that have followed in its wake.

Twitter has suspended the personal account of the US Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene for repeated violations of its rules around coronavirus misinformation.  
The action against the Republican lawmaker came under Twitter's strike system, which identifies posts about the virus that could cause harm.
The company had previously suspended the Georgia congresswoman four times. 
Rep Greene said the ban proved that the company is ""an enemy to America"".
In a lengthy statement posted to the social media outlet, Telegram, the 47-year-old said ""social media platforms can't stop the truth from being spread far and wide"" and accused Twitter of aiding unidentified enemies in ""a Communist revolution"". 
Her official congressional account, which staffers appear to post on infrequently, remains active. 
The congresswoman's ban comes after she had tweeted on Saturday, falsely, about ""extremely high amounts of Covid vaccine deaths"" in the US. 
In a statement issued to the BBC, a Twitter spokesperson said that Rep Greene has been banned for ""repeated"" violations of its coronavirus misinformation policy, which allows four ""strikes"" with varying suspensions from the platform, before issuing a permanent ban. 
The social media giant had issued her with a fourth strike in August after she falsely posted that coronavirus vaccines were ""failing"" and called on regulators not to approve new shots.  
""We've been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,"" the spokesperson said.
Since her election in 2020, Rep Greene has become one of Washington's most controversial politicians. 
She has been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged and has in the past been associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory. 
Despite the US struggling to contain the coronavirus, from which more than 825,000 people now died, she has been a determined opponent of measures designed to tackle the virus. 
She has frequently called into question the efficacy of vaccines and has regularly been fined for refusing to follow Covid guidelines in Congress, including those regarding mask-wearing on the House floor.

Crisis-hit Chinese real estate giant Evergrande has suspended trade in its shares on the Hong Kong as investors await news on its restructuring plan.
The statement to the stock exchange did not give a reason for the trading halt.
Evergrande has more than $300bn (£222bn) of debts and is scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors.
Last week, the company dialled back plans to repay investors in its wealth management products.
Evergrande said on Friday that each investor in its wealth management product could expect to receive $1,257 each month as principal payment for three months irrespective of when the investment matures.
The company had earlier not mentioned any amount and had agreed to repay 10% of the investment by the end of the month when the product matures.
Evergrande said in a statement posted on the wealth unit's website that the situation was not ""ideal"" and that it would ""actively raise funds"", and update the repayment plan in late March, without giving further details.
The announcement was seen as highlighting the deepening cash squeeze at the struggling property developer.
Last week, Evergrande did not make some interest payments on its offshore bonds. 
The company's $19bn in international bonds were deemed to be in default by rating agencies after it missed a payment deadline last month.
Evergrande suspended its shares in early October, saying the move was ahead of ""an announcement containing inside information about a major transaction"".
There were reports at the time that rival real estate firm Hopson Development was set to buy a 51% stake in its property services unit.
However, later that month Evergrande said the $2.6bn (£1.9bn) deal had fallen through as they were unable to agree on the terms of a deal.
For months, many of the details of Evergrande's debt crisis have been clouded in uncertainty. 
But some experts believe that this is no accident - it is exactly how Beijing wants it to be.
When the Chinese Communist Party changed its rules to limit how much money the country's property developers could borrow, they knew that it would cause major problems for Evergrande  and other heavily indebted real estate firms. 
China watchers say the government wanted to send a clear message that what they consider to be the reckless expansion of the sector could not continue. 
Authorities have also signalled that they have no intention of bailing out Evergrande, and its billionaire founder, because it would go against President Xi Jinping's ""Common Prosperity"" policies, which aim to distribute wealth more fairly throughout society. 
However, Beijing is also, understandably, keen to ensure that Evergrande's troubles do not become China's Lehman moment, which could affect the rest of the world's second largest economy and beyond.
So, the slow restructuring of Evergrande continues quietly behind closed doors. And, just like today's trading halt announcement, no reasons are given.

Ukraine's culture minister says he has complained to Netflix over the portrayal of a character from Kyiv in Emily in Paris.  
The Netflix show follows a young American, played by Lily Collins, who travels to the French capital for work. 
In the latest series, Petra, a Ukrainian, shoplifts during a trip with main character Emily. 
Oleksandr Tkachenko described the caricature image of Petra as ""insulting"". 
Petra, who is played by Ukrainian actress Daria Panchenko, is also portrayed to have a poor fashion sense and is afraid of being deported. 
""In Emily in Paris, we have a caricature image of a Ukrainian woman that is unacceptable. It is also insulting,"" Mr Tkachenko wrote on Telegram. 
""Is that how Ukrainians are seen abroad?"" he added. 
According to Ukrainian media, Mr Tkachenko has sent a letter to the streaming service complaining about the portrayal of Petra. 
One Ukrainian resident in Paris agreed with his criticism.
""The way you treated the image of Ukrainians in your second season, 4th episode is such a low cost trick, absolute scandal and a shame,"" Yevheniya Havrylko wrote in an Instagram post, which has had more than 75,000 likes. 
Others have chosen to defend the show, like Ukrainian film producer Natalka Yakymovych who said: ""So in a TV series, negative characters can be anything but Ukrainian? Obviously, we all would like her to be from Moscow, but you don't always get what you want.""
It is not the first time Emily in Paris has been criticised for its portrayal of different nationalities. 
When the first season was released, it was criticised, particularly in France, for promoting stereotypical images of the city and its residents. 
It portrays the French as rude people who wear berets and frequently cheat on their partners. 
The new series of the show features Alfie, a stereotypical Brit who spends his time drinking in pubs and watching football. 
Darren Star, creator of the show, previously defended the first series, saying he was ""not sorry for looking at Paris through a glamorous lens"". 
Mr Star said he had drawn on his own experiences of visiting the city. 
""I wanted to showcase Paris in a really wonderful way that would encourage people to fall in love with the city in a way that I have,"" he told the New York Times.

Richard Leakey, a world-renowned Kenyan conservationist and fossil hunter has died aged 77. 
His groundbreaking work contributed to the recognition of Africa as the birthplace of humankind.
He also spearheaded campaigns to stop poaching in Kenya, famously burning the country's stockpile of poached ivory. 
Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said Leakey had ""served our country with distinction"". 
Leakey served in various positions in the Kenyan government including the National Museums of Kenya, the Kenya Wildlife Service and as head of the civil service.
""Besides his distinguished career in public service, Dr Leakey is celebrated for his prominent role in Kenya's civil society where he founded and successfully ran a number of institutions,"" Mr Kenyatta said. 
Leakey followed in his parents' footsteps in paleoanthropology - the practice of seeking to understand human evolution by studying fossils and ancient tools. 
In his 20s, Leakey made his own important finds, and in two ground-breaking books (Origins and People of the Lake), he explained the emergence of Homo erectus, an ancestor of modern humans.
His work contributed to the growing body of evidence that the earliest humans had lived on the African continent. 
In 1981, he fronted a seven-part BBC television series called ""The Making of Mankind"", which made him a household name.
In the late 1980s, he switched careers to take over as head of Kenya's Wildlife Service at a time when poachers were wiping out the country's entire elephant and rhino populations. 
He told his rangers to shoot poachers on sight and organised the spectacular public burning of a huge haul of ivory. 
In 1993, the small plane he was flying in lost power and crashed. He survived but both of his legs were amputated below the knee. 
That did not stop him from entering Kenyan politics, setting up a new political party. But his political career did not last and in 1998 he took up a role as head of Kenya's civil service, with a mission to fight official corruption. 
He lasted three years in the role before returning to the Kenya Wildlife Service. 
At the time of his death, he was serving as chairman of the Turkana Basin Institute at Stony Brook University in the US. The institute works to facilitate research and education in palaeontology and archaeology in northern Kenya.
Kenya's Deputy president said Leakey ""inspired many Kenyans with his loyalty to his country. He loved Kenya"".

Aoife Beary, a survivor of the 2015 Berkeley balcony collapse that killed six students, has died, aged 27. 
She died after suffering a stroke in the Irish capital, Dublin. 
Ms Beary had experienced life-changing injuries after a fourth-floor balcony collapsed in June 2015 while she was celebrating her 21st birthday. 
A later investigation found that joists supporting the deck were suffering from dry rot and had been constructed by a company with a history of complaints. 
In recent years she became an advocate for construction reform in California.
Ms Beary and her friends had been visiting the US under the popular J-1 summer working visa programme when the tragedy struck. 
The balcony had been constructed by a company that had a history of legal claims against it and which it had not disclosed to the Californian state licensing board that regulates the building industry.
Five Irish students and one Irish-American friend were killed in the collapse, while seven others suffered a range of serious injuries. 
In 2015 the families of those killed reached a confidential settlement with the companies involved in the building's construction. 
Aoife Beary was left with a traumatic brain injury, broken arms, hands, pelvis and jaw, as well as lacerations to her liver, kidneys and spleen, a collapsed lung and broken ribs. She later underwent open heart surgery. 
In 2016, she testified before the California state legislature during a hearing on legislation to force building contractors to be more transparent about past legal claims against them. 
During emotional testimony, she told legislators how she had lost much of her independence after the accident and that her career goals had been ended.
""My life has been changed forever,"" she said.
She also recalled how she and her friends, who she had known since the age of four, had travelled the world together. She said that her birthday would now ""always be their anniversary"".

83;"China: Why some think ""small eyes"" are not beautiful";['2022-01-03T00:28:55.000Z'];['By Waiyee Yip'];['social media', 'china', 'beauty standards'];['small', 'eyes', 'look', 'hopes', 'model', 'ms', 'kinder', 'need', 'think', 'particular', 'post', 'china', 'latest', 'weibo', 'beautiful'];"
""Do I not deserve to be Chinese just because I have small eyes?""
That is what Chinese model Cai Niangniang wrote in a recent impassioned social media post, after old pictures of her went viral for all the wrong reasons.
For several days she had been attacked online for being ""deliberately offensive"" and ""unpatriotic"", over a series of advertisements she had appeared in for Chinese snack brand Three Squirrels.
Her apparent crime? Having narrow eyes. 
Some social media users were so outraged that the company eventually removed the ads online, and apologised for making people ""feel uncomfortable"" over them. 
But Ms Cai said that she did not know what she had done to get cyber-bullied, noting that she was ""just doing my job"" as a model. 
""My looks were given to me by my parents,"" the 28-year-old wrote on the Twitter-like platform Weibo.
""Have I insulted China the day I was born just because of how I look?"" 
The ads, originally shot in 2019, were dug up by nationalist netizens amid a period of heightened sensitivity online in China over advertisements depicting Chinese people.
In November, a top Chinese fashion photographer apologised for her ""ignorance"" after a picture she shot for French luxury brand Dior sparked a backlash. It had featured a Chinese model with narrow eyes.
In recent days, there have been other incidents of social media outrage over adverts by Mercedes-Benz and Gucci that featured Chinese women with narrow eyes. 
Amid a growing sense of online nationalism and anti-West sentiment in China, some have seized upon these advertisements as examples of racism towards Chinese people. By featuring models with narrow eyes, critics say these companies are perpetuating Western stereotypes of Chinese faces. 
Many asked why these adverts did not feature the kind of models more commonly seen in Chinese advertisements who have fair skin and large round eyes, which are typically considered ideal beauty features in China.
A recent editorial by state news outlet China Daily highlighted how ""for too long, Western criteria of beauty, and Western tastes and likes and dislikes dominated aesthetics"". That included depicting Asian women in adverts as having narrow eyes, it said.
""The West no longer has an absolute say over everything,"" the opinion piece read. 
""The Chinese people do not need to follow their standards on what constitutes beauty and what kinds of women are considered beautiful.""
As a Chinese brand, Three Squirrels ""should have known about the sensitivity of Chinese consumers to how they are portrayed in advertisements,"", it added. 
At the heart of the controversy is the perception that such depictions invoke the ""slanted eyes"" stereotype of Asian people which emerged in Western culture in the 19th century, and which is considered hugely offensive by many Asians today.
In Hollywood, the quintessential Asian villain Fu Manchu was pictured with thin and narrow eyes. The character embodied and perpetuated ""yellow peril"", the racist idea that Asian cultures threatened Western society.
""There is indeed a long history in the use of 'slanted eyes' to discriminate against Asians,"" Dr Liu Wen from Taiwan's Academia Sinica told BBC Chinese. 
But the insistence among some Chinese on one particular beauty ideal also stands in marked contrast to the current global debate over diversity and the push for wider representation of Asian faces in the media. 
Observers say that while it is understandable that some consumers would be offended over the adverts, the outcry is also too simplistic as it rejects the idea that there can be in fact many different ways to look Chinese. 
""Rejecting 'slanted eyes' is a very dangerous phenomenon, because it is the rejection of aesthetic pluralism,"" Dr Luwei Rose Luqiu from Hong Kong Baptist University said. 
""It's stifling beauty that does not meet a certain standard."" 
Experts have also pointed out that traditional standards of beauty in China had in fact favoured narrow eyes. For example, paintings from what is widely considered as China's golden age for art and culture, the Tang Dynasty period from 618 to 907 AD, prominently featured women with long, narrow eyes. 
""Despite some variations across different dynasties, more narrow eyes were preferred in ancient China,"" said Dr Jaehee Jung, a consumer behaviour expert at the University of Delaware. 
The current preference for large round eyes, ironically, may be a recent phenomenon influenced by the West. Some experts believe the latest shift in beauty standards began around the late 1970s, thanks to exposure to foreign advertising and entertainment when China opened its doors to the world.
""Women in contemporary China seem to endorse much of the Western standards for female beauty ideals pervasive in media images,"" said Dr Jung.
These days, large round eyes are so prized that it is not uncommon for young Chinese women to wear makeup or even undergo cosmetic surgery procedures to make their eyes appear bigger, such as creating a ""double eyelid"" crease.
But for Ms Cai, the model at the centre of the latest controversy, she hopes that people can be ""kinder"" to those who look different. She said in her Weibo post that there was no need to attack her even if they did not appreciate her particular look. 
""My eyes are just like this, in fact they're even smaller in real life [than in the ads]... Everyone has their own charm!""

84;How Falklands War and rugby led to 40-year friendship;['2022-01-02T21:54:24.000Z'];['By Neil Prior'];['falklands war', 'argentina', 'ammanford'];['falklands', 'wife', 'tying', 'left', 'mess', 'licence', 'war', 'rugby', 'sailing', 'jan', 'knot', 'friendship', 'summer', '40year', 'led', 'married'];"
On a ship in the heat of the Falklands War, an Argentine prisoner and his Welsh guard forged a friendship during a night of beer and rugby.
Irfon Higgins was a soldier on the SS Canberra, tasked with guarding 4,500 prisoners of war, or PoWs.
When Irfon asked who spoke English, PoW Giorgio Podesta answered ""I do"".
Nearly 40 years after Giorgio helped him stop a mutiny, Irfon says: ""I can't imagine my life now without him in it"".
Their story has been recounted in a book on the 1982 conflict by Brian Short - The Band That Went to War.
Recalling the day he met Giorgio, Irfon said: ""I was guarding 4,500 PoWs on the Canberra, and trying to escort them in groups of 10 to the shower.
""It was like herding cats, so I shouted 'Do any of you speak English?'
""Giorgio said 'I do', and from then on he became my go-to man and interpreter.""
Giorgio admitted he had been reluctant to learn English as a child, but it had ended up helping him through the war.
""My mother sent me to take English classes, against my will, with the excuse that 'at some point you will need it',"" he said. ""I was happy because I was talking in English with Irfon. After all the hardships of war, now I felt safe, fed, warm and with a friend.""
At Easter 1982 Royal Marines Commando Band saxophonist Irfon was playing rugby for his regiment in Plymouth when he was called off the pitch with a vital message.
They'd been mobilised to travel to the Falklands as part of the British task force. Argentine forces had landed on the Falklands to stake a territorial claim to the islands, which it calls the Malvinas.
""When you tell people you were in the Royal Marines they instantly think you were some kind of hard nut. But I was just a musician, not a proper soldier, so I was amazed that we'd been called up at all,"" said Irfon, from Ammanford, Carmarthenshire.
""I was excited as much as anything, and for the first few weeks until we reached Ascension Island it all seemed like a dream.""
But Irfon had one important matter to settle before going to war.
""My wife Jan and I had been due to get married that summer, and I didn't want to go away without tying the knot,"" he said. ""So we got an emergency licence, and were married in May, just before I left - none of the boys could come as we were confined to barracks before sailing, but we had a do in the mess afterwards."" 
They spent the first few weeks of the voyage sunning themselves on the deck.
As the weather changed from northern hemisphere summer to southern hemisphere winter, Irfon said the mood aboard the Canberra also altered.
""Initially we couldn't believe how lucky we were going to war on a P&O cruise ship, the luxury was like nothing any of us had ever experienced before,"" he said. ""It had just come off a Mediterranean cruise, so the ballrooms, chandeliers, food and drink were out of this world.  
""But as we entered San Carlos Sound we realised how vulnerable we were.""
As a requisitioned cruise ship, the Canberra had no defences other than a few machine guns mounted on the rails and the shoulder-launched rockets carried by the Parachute Regiment.
They soon came under attack from the Argentine air force.
""We were designated as a hospital ship, but as we'd also transported troops we weren't able to claim the protection afforded under the Geneva Convention,"" said Irfon. ""Really we were sitting ducks, and after the war we discovered that the British government had already factored in losing the Canberra early on; they expected us to die.""
After offloading the Parachute Regiment to landing craft, the Canberra travelled to South Georgia to convey Welsh Guards and Gurkhas to the Falklands.
As the fighting ensued, the ship soon started to receive helicopter loads of both injured British and captured Argentinians.
""As we saw the hideous injuries our boys were taking, it was hard not to take it out on the PoWs,"" said Irfon.
But as hostility grew between the enemies, a friendship was also blossoming.
""Once I started talking to Giorgio about Welsh rugby - JPR and JJ - I soon realised we had far more in common than I did with many of the British troops,"" said Irfon.  
""There were some who were hardened special forces dedicated to the military junta, though most - like Giorgio - were conscripted soldiers who didn't want to be there any more than we did. One night I smuggled him out of the ballroom where the PoWs were being held, and took him up to my cabin for a night on the beer and a proper chat about rugby,"" said Irfon.
Giorgio said the talk centred around the match ""between Los Pumas and Wales in 1976, in which Wales beat us at the last minute with a penalty kick by Phil Bennett, and the legendary Gareth Edwards, and fullback John Peter Rhys Williams.
""We talked about our homes, our families and our friends. Wishing to return to our homes soon. He took the opportunity to introduce me to his friends and cabin mates. The smile returned to my face.""
Ever since that night, Irfon and Giorgio have been firm friends. But it was not just beer and sport that cemented their relationship.
Author Brian Short, who was aboard the Canberra at the time, said: ""What both he and Giorgio are too modest to say is that between them they prevented a mutiny on the ship.
""On the way to Puerto Madryn, Giorgio tipped off Irfon that some of the diehard Argentinians were planning to seize the ship by force. Irfon and I held both ends of the corridor with a machine gun each, and in the end there was no trouble at all.""
After a brief but bitter 72-day conflict, British forces regained the Falklands and ejected the Argentines. As the Canberra repatriated the PoWs to Puerto Madryn - the Welsh-speaking enclave of Argentina - in July 1982, a Navy photographer captured Irfon and Giorgio sharing a heartfelt goodbye handshake on the gangplank.
The pair lost touch for a few years, with difficulties getting letters between Wales and Argentina. But soon enough, Irfon's wife Jan found Giorgio.
""We've been out to visit him, and he's been over to Wales - I can't imagine my life now without him in it,"" said Irfon.
The story of their friendship is just one of dozens of similar ones in Brian Short's book.
Although the war caused so much suffering and death, he said he wrote it to seek out the good which came from the chaos.

85;Books 2022: A pick of what's coming up;['2021-12-28T00:04:58.000Z'];['By Rebecca Thomas'];['literature', 'books'];['tv', 'coming', 'question', 'pick', 'marriage', 'yasmin', 'truly', 'whats', 'try', 'south', 'young', '2022', 'books', 'love', 'sangster'];"
Many of us have felt a more pressing need to find our own corner of heaven over the last two years, and some have found theirs between the covers of a book.
Despite the fragility of the wider economy, £1.1bn has been spent on 128 million books in the UK since mid-March, when market analysts Nielsen resumed their data reporting. That figure is up 9% from the same period in 2019.
The juggernaut that is Richard Osman's Thursday Murder Club books has led this drive forward, with both novels dominating the best-seller lists. Meanwhile, 30 of the top 50 bestselling books of 2021 were written by women.
These green shoots of optimism are of course set against a backdrop of continued uncertainty. But with hope in our hearts, let's look at just some of the new titles for 2022 that might nonetheless give the horizon a rosy glow.
On and off the page, Marian Keyes' beguiling affability and fearless honesty about the crappy side of life have won her an army of worldwide fans. Her 15 titles include Sushi For Beginners, Anybody Out There, Grown Ups and her most successful, 1998's Rachel's Holiday. 
In Keyes' first sequel, Rachel, the party girl who partied her way into rehab, is back - and sorted. Life's good. But circumstances and emotions are never that simple, and as ghosts from her past begin to resurface, Rachel battles to hold her nerve.

86;Sound Of 2022: Lola Young's slow-burning anthems are bubbling over;['2022-01-03T00:02:56.000Z'];['By Mark Savage'];['sound of 2022', 'music'];['anthems', 'im', 'world', 'suddenly', 'certain', 'understand', 'mental', 'lola', 'things', 'really', '2022', 'youngs', 'feeling', 'slowburning', 'sound', 'bubbling', 'health'];"
""Are you joking? No way! Oh my God. That's amazing. Such good news.""
Singer-songwriter Lola Young has just learned she's placed fourth in BBC Radio 1's Sound Of 2022 - which aims to predict the biggest new stars of the coming year.
She's in good company. In previous years, fourth place has gone to artists like Jorja Smith, Khalid, Sampha and Joy Crookes, who've all shaped the sounds of pop and soul in their own mould.
Young's deep, expressive vocals will be familiar to millions after she covered Together In Electric Dreams for this year's John Lewis Christmas Advert.
But the 21-year-old has been on the path to stardom since she wrote her first song, an ode to Santa Claus, when she was 11. 
Before long, she'd won the Open Mic UK contest and booked a place at the Brit School, while playing as many gigs as she could around her native south London.
""I've done so many [awful] open mic pub gigs where I've rocked up and played to three old men drinking beer and talking through my performance,"" she says. ""But I had to do that.""
It was at one such showcase that she caught the attention of Amy Winehouse's ex-manager Nick Shymansky - who loved her husky, soulful sound, but was reluctant to take her on. 
""He said he was too busy and too hurt from his past experiences,"" Young explains. So he introduced her to Nick Huggett, who discovered and signed Adele... before having second thoughts.
""Nick S decided that he couldn't miss out - so they ended up managing me together. They're like my uncles now!""
Signed to Island Records, Young released an assured debut album, Intro, at the age of 18. More recently, the attention-grabbing singles Fake and Bad Tattoo have seen her played on BBC Radio 1, and Elton John's Rocket Hour show. 
She ended 2021 with a nomination for the Brits Critics' Choice award; and starts 2022 with the endorsement of the 130 pundits who voted for the BBC Sound Of list (the top three will be announced over the next three days).
""It feels like things are getting better and better,"" she beams. ""The bubbling under the surface is starting to really, really bubble over!""
We caught up with her over Zoom to find out more about her backstory - and what she's got in store for the year ahead.
Have you always wanted to be a musician?
Yeah, I think for some people it comes a little bit later on, but I had it in my head that I wanted to be in music since I was maybe 10 or 11.
I've seen interviews where you said you weren't a natural singer. How much work did you have to do?
I think in other interviews, I've maybe been a little bit misunderstood in the sense that people thought I couldn't sing at all. It wasn't that. I had a voice, I was able to hold a note, but I didn't have the technical things like vibrato at all.
So, it was more the case that I had to work hard to get power and strength. Like with Beyoncé, I can imagine she just popped out singing to the heavens. I didn't have that.
I think she actually cried in perfect pitch when she was born. 
Yeah, literally.
What did you enjoy singing when you were a kid?
The first album I remember putting on and really enjoying was Paolo Nutini's These Streets. Then, growing up, I listened to a lot of Eminem and Biggie and old school rap; and then eventually a lot of David Bowie, Prince. So my inspirations are quite different.
Do you remember the first time you recorded yourself singing? 
Yeah, I was probably about 13, 14 and I went into a studio. Hearing my voice back was pretty mad - but it confirmed that's what I wanted to do.
You entered the Open Mic UK competition around the same time. What was that experience like?
Back when I was a kid, I thought X Factor or Britain's Got Talent was the way that people blew up. I didn't really understand the business side of things. So Open Mic UK was something I thought was going to change my life and, obviously, it helped a little bit - but it wasn't a game changer.
You won with an original song, right?
Yeah, it was called Never Enough and it's a song that's never gonna get released!
Has your writing changed since then?
A hell of a lot! I'm very careful about each lyric now. It can't just be a throwaway. And if it is, then we scrap it. 
I guess when you start out, you're almost impersonating your favourite artists. Then as you grow and get more experience, you put more of yourself into the songs?
That's true - but I think people sometimes underestimate the real power that a young person has. I have one song that I wrote when I was 13, that I still really believe [in] and that's going to be on the album.
Is that I Learned From You?
Yeah, you know my music!
Why did that song survive when other ones got cast away?
It had quite an interesting concept. It was about a close relative and how I was trying to understand our relationship. It's kind of complex and, although I didn't really realise at the time, it's quite a mature song. 
You went to the Brit school after that. Was it what you expected?
Um, no, it wasn't. There's a tendency for people to assume the Brit school is the way to the top, but it's still a school. You still do lessons, you still meet bitchy people and there's still bullying. Even the headmaster would say, ""We're not trying to create famous people. That's not why we're here."" 
I'm not saying I expected more than that because it was a really great experience. It helped me understand my style and where I wanted to go with my music. 
You released your first album, Intro, when you were 18.
I was 18, yeah.
One of the tracks, Blind Love, is still your most played song on Spotify. Why do you think people love that song, in particular?
Just because it's a classic, sad love song. It's about the journey of a relationship and how it ends, but also trying to come to peace with that. I think a lot of people can relate to that feeling.
On Six Feet Under, you sing about being depressed and thinking about death. What's it like to share dark feelings like those in your music?
It's very complex suffering from mental health, I think. Especially as a person who has gone through life without really thinking about mental health - and then suddenly it hits you. You suddenly understand the stigma around it, because you start feeling ashamed about saying certain things, or feeling certain things. So I feel really strongly that I have to be super-honest in my lyrics. I'm sharing [those feelings] with the world but also, I'm trying to share it with myself, as well.
What do your friends and family think of those songs?
Sometimes it can be hard but my family and my friends are super-understanding. They know already what I've gone through. So as scary as it is to talk about the dark side of your mind, the importance of sharing, of honesty, overrides the fear.
The Intro album was just starting to make waves when you developed cysts on your vocal cords. Were you ever worried you'd lose your voice?
It was very frightening, for sure, especially because I had a new type of vocal surgery. But I had the best surgeon and it was fine. I mean, I'm still in recovery.  My high register still cracks, so I might need to go for a check-up.
Just as you came out of hospital, the world went into lockdown. How did you find that?
For me. being indoors and being in my own space is quite hard. I hate it. I can't be alone. And I got Covid as well - not badly, but I did have Covid.
But it was a very tough year for a lot of people. People were very low and lost their jobs, you know? So my year was hard, but it wasn't the worst.
The other thing you did in 2020 was release Woman, which is one of your best songs. And it's quite political as well...
Woman was a process of me trying to understand how much one could be a feminist without being radical. 
I think that people really don't understand what that word [feminist] means. I remember getting cat-called as a teenager going to school by an old man in a van and, as you grow up, you start to question why the world lets you believe this is normal.  So in that song, I'm explaining what happens when you feel like you're less [important] than a man. It was something that I felt really strongly about. 
The songs you've released subsequently, like Ruin My Make Up and Fake, have a similar sense of strength and defiance. I'm interested in why that's a theme that you've focused on lyrically in the last two years.
I don't really know why.... I think it's more that I wanted to change my sound up. I was listening a lot to The Cure, and using a lot of vintage sounds and baritone guitars. And I think when the sonic changed, the lyrics changed with it. Like Fake, for example, I think the drama goes well with the sound of the record.
It sounds like something off a Tarantino soundtrack.
Yeah, that was the intention!
You ended 2021 by singing the John Lewis Christmas advert. I've always wondered how much input you get in that process? Like, do you get to choose the song?
The advertising company suggested the song. The only change I made was to sing it in a joyous way, with a tone of hope. That was a bit of a challenge, because the movement of the track is quite melancholic - but obviously it's supposed to be a Christmas song so it's not supposed to be too depressing!
Since then, I've started hearing your music more and more on the radio and in places like H&M. What's that like?
It's weird - but it's all I've ever wanted, so obviously that's really good.
And so, on to 2022. Are you working on a new album?
It's in the works! I've got a good few songs that I'm happy with but I don't know when exactly it will be released. Hopefully end of next year.

87;Can fitness apps be as effective as a personal trainer?;['2022-01-03T00:20:27.000Z'];['By Charlie Metcalfe'];"['gyms', 'fitness trackers', 'fitness', 'life', 'lifestyle', ""new year's resolutions""]";['apps', 'theyre', 'individuals', 'effective', 'trainers', 'doing', 'fitness', 'sessions', 'really', 'onetoone', 'trainer', 'personal', 'exercises', 'injuries'];"
As we start 2022, lots of us will be resuming the battle to lose weight and get fit. A wealth of high-tech fitness apps are now available to help, but are they anywhere near as good as hiring a human personal trainer?
Four years ago, Jenny Wiener was in a fitness slump.
She wanted to improve her physical and mental health, but her workouts lacked intensity without a proper training programme to follow.
When she went to the gym she says she often chose ""easy"" options, like jogging on a treadmill, to avoid more daunting exercises.
A personal trainer who might push her was out of the question because of the high cost - typically prices start from £30 an hour.
Ms Wiener, 32, who works as an events manager in St Albans, then discovered fitness app Freeletics.
To use the app you first input information about your previous training experiences and preferences, and goals. A virtual coach then used that information to suggest a personalised training regime.
At the end of each workout, the Freeletics app then asks Ms Wiener to provide feedback about its suitability and difficulty. The app's artificial intelligence (AI) software system then uses her answers - plus those from its other 53 million users around the world - to adjust future training sessions.
""The AI aspect is one of the main things that got me interested,"" says Ms Wiener. ""I was going to the gym every day before, but seeing zero results.
""When I found Freeletics, I was like 'OMG it's a PT [personal trainer] in my pocket, my gym buddy'.""
She adds that she finds the workouts exciting, because no two are ever the same. And that, as a result, the app has helped her to lose four-stone.
Freeletics' digital personal trainer app, called 'The Coach', costs from £1.78 a week. The firm's chief product and technology officer, Kornelius Brunner, says it ""gets smarter and better"" as users give it more and more feedback. 
However, sports and fitness psychologist, Anthony Papathomas, says that such apps are no substitute for human personal trainers.
""With an interpersonal relationship you are going to get that increased sensitivity to personal needs,"" says the senior lecturer at Loughborough University's National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine.
""If you don't fancy the session, or if you're not in a mood, which is often the case, particularly in exercise behaviour change,"" he says. ""Then I'm not sure the kind of alert [you get] on your phone, necessarily takes into consideration that we are human beings with competing interests outside of our health and fitness.""
Whereas, Mr Papathomas points out a ""human being"" trainer is probably more likely to empathise ""and exercise is only sustainable if we enjoy it.""
Brighton-based marketing consultant, Tom Bourlet, says he used to love exercising, but lost motivation after entering into a relationship.
Then in January of this year, he and his partner received a wedding invitation, and both were determined to lose a set amount of weight to get in shape for the big day.
He discovered app FitnessAI, which uses a similar approach to Freeletics - mining its users' data to improve and personalise all their workouts.
""I often utilise data in my work, and find it incredibly useful to ensure you're making continuous progress, therefore the entire concept appealed to me,"" says Mr Bourlet.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
""One guilty factor of training can be to keep doing the same reps [repetitions of a specific exercise], or weights, each week, failing to push yourself each time. However, the app helped to set out what I should be trying to achieve each week.""
While Mr Bourlet used to take long rests, from two to three minutes between each set of gym work, the app's AI kept him on-target. It gave him an exact rest-time, according to the specific exercise or weight lift session, and his performance.
He says that, overall, it helped him reach his weight-loss target of dropping three stone (19kg) almost a month ahead of plan.
FitnessAI founder, Jake Mor believes the AI's mathematical approach makes it better than a personal trainer.
""FitnessAI does tons of math behind the scenes to figure out what your workout plan should look like,"" he says. ""While trainers are great motivators, they are not math professionals.""
Perhaps unsurprisingly, London-based personal trainer Aimee Victoria Long disagrees with this analysis.
""Personal trainers come with a higher cost, but when you do one-to-one sessions, you can check an individual's form, to see they're doing the exercises correctly,"" she says. ""It really ensures that they're not going to have any injuries from the exercises that they're doing, which you can't really get from an app.
""Also, I can get to know not only their physical health, but also their mental health, because sometimes people are training all the time, and it might not be good for their mental health. And that's not going to be shown or picked up on an app.""
Yet sometimes fitness apps can help by asking the user questions that a human person trainer might not feel comfortable posing.
Take Jennis, the fitness app by British Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill. It requests data from female users about their menstrual cycles, in order to better programme their workouts.
Ms Ennis-Hill explains: ""The daily conversations [via the app] that we have with each woman mean that we regularly update recommendations, so that you're always getting sessions most suited to your hormonal profile.
""This, in turn, means you're doing what's right for your body, making bigger training gains, and capitalising on what your hormones are doing each day.""
Former British soldier Rachel Carey, 37, is a fan. After ovulation she receives more strength-based workouts, whereas in the first 14 days of her menstrual cycle, she receives more high-intensity workouts.
""The cycle mapping recommendations for the workouts are so much more appropriate for physiologically what's going on for me,"" says Ms Carey.

88;Virginia Giuffre: Prince Andrew accuser's deal with Jeffrey Epstein to be released;['2022-01-03T09:23:57.000Z'];['By George Bowden'];['prince andrew, duke of york'];['sweat', 'newsnight', 'prince', 'war', 'jeffrey', 'released', 'overdose', 'impossible', 'deal', 'suffered', 'told', 'shot', 'epstein', 'accusers', 'giuffre', 'falklands', 'andrew', 'didnt', 'virginia'];"
An agreement between Virginia Giuffre and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which could be key to a civil case involving the Duke of York, is to be made public for the first time later.
The 2009 settlement between Epstein and Ms Giuffre is to be released on Monday after an order by judges in the US.
Prince Andrew's lawyers believe it could release him from liability in the case brought by Ms Giuffre, who accuses him of sexual assault when she was 17.
He has consistently denied the claims.
Andrew B Brettler, who represents the duke, had argued at a previous hearing that the ""settlement agreement"" would end Ms Giuffre's lawsuit against Andrew.
The settlement was reached between Ms Giuffre, also known as Virginia Roberts, and the prince's former friend and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in prison in 2019.
Mr Brettler had previously told a New York hearing the agreement ""releases Prince Andrew and others from any purported liability arising from the claims Ms Giuffre asserted against Prince Andrew here"".
US District Judge Lewis A Kaplan, who is presiding over the civil case, is due to hold a video teleconference on Tuesday when a request by the duke's legal team to dismiss the case will be heard.
Ms Giuffre is suing the Queen's son for allegedly sexually assaulting her in London, New York and the Virgin Islands when she was a teenager.
She is seeking unspecified damages, but there is speculation the sum could be in the millions of dollars.
She claims she was trafficked by disgraced financier Epstein to have sex with Andrew when she was 17 and a minor under US law.
Andrew, 61, has denied all the allegations, telling BBC Newsnight in 2019: ""It didn't happen. I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.""
Judge Kaplan last week denied a motion from Andrew's lawyers to halt the civil proceedings while the issue of where Ms Giuffre, now 38 and thought to be residing in Australia, lives is dealt with.
Last week, Ms Giuffre's lawyers said they were seeking proof of Andrew's claim he had an inability to sweat, which he said showed a ""problem"" with her account of an evening with the duke.
""I didn't sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenalin in the Falklands War when I was shot at and it was almost impossible for me to sweat,"" he told Newsnight.
Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and Andrew's friend, faces the rest of her life in jail after she was convicted last week of helping to procure teenage girls for the disgraced financier to sexually abuse.

90;Hong Kong: Pro-democracy website Citizen News is latest to close;['2022-01-03T05:02:01.000Z'];['BBC News'];['press freedom', 'china', 'hong kong'];['kong', 'safety', 'late', 'support', 'heavy', 'close', 'operations', 'readers', 'website', 'hong', 'citizen', 'post', 'outlet', 'thanked', 'latest', 'prodemocracy', 'wellbeing'];"
Hong Kong independent news website Citizen News has announced it will close on Tuesday, the latest in a series of pro-democracy news outlets which have shuttered in recent months. 
It cited a ""deteriorating media environment"" as the reason.
The move comes after last week's police raid on Stand News, where several were arrested on sedition charges.
Observers say new laws put in place by China have created a climate of fear stifling free speech.
Citizen News, established in 2017, is one of the last few Chinese-language pro-democracy publications in Hong Kong. 
In its Facebook post late on Sunday, the outlet thanked readers for their support, before announcing ""with a heavy heart"" that it would cease operations from 4 January to ""ensure the safety and well-being of everyone"".
""Regrettably, what was ahead of us [was] not just pouring rains or blowing winds, but hurricanes and tsunamis,"" the statement said. 
""Sadly, we can no longer strive to turn our beliefs into reality without fear because of the sea change in the society over the past two years and the deteriorating media environment.""
Last week the pro-democracy website Stand News declared it would shut down after its offices was raided by police and senior staff were arrested on charges of ""conspiracy to publish seditious publications"".
Pro-democracy outlet Apple Daily - a publication known for being a vocal critic of the Hong Kong and Chinese leadership - was forced to close in June 2021, following sustained pressure on the paper from authorities. Its owner, prominent media mogul Jimmy Lai, has been jailed.

Hong Kong was handed back to China from Britain in 1997 under the agreement that rights such as freedom of assembly and freedom of speech would be guaranteed in the territory. 
However, critics say those rights have been increasingly eroded as Hong Kong authorities crack down on dissent in the city in recent months, following the imposition of a national security law introduced by Beijing in 2020. 
The controversial law criminalises secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces, and carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Hong Kong authorities reject those claims and the city's government denies targeting the media, insisting instead that the law is critical for preserving national security.

91;Oxfam India says it's 'severely' hit by ban on foreign funds;['2022-01-03T05:39:00.000Z'];['BBC News'];['asia', 'india', 'oxfam'];['oxfam', 'foreign', 'india', 'patel', 'youre', 'international', 'head', 'hit', 'severely', 'ban', 'funds', 'working', 'makes', 'law', 'violation'];"
The charity Oxfam has said its work in India will be ""severely affected"" after it lost its licence to receive funds from abroad.
The restriction came into effect from 1 January, Oxfam said. 
It added that it would contact India's home ministry to ""urge"" it to lift the restrictions. 
The news comes a week after India blocked foreign funding for the The Missionaries of Charity, founded by Mother Teresa.
The home ministry had cited ""adverse inputs"" as the reason for revoking the licence last week. 
But it's still unclear what led to Oxfam India losing its foreign-funding licence. 
Registration under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) is mandatory for charities, NGOs and any non-profit organisations receiving foreign funding in India. 
The licence granted to nearly 6,000 such organisations lapsed on 1 January, The Hindu newspaper reported. It quoted an unnamed official who said the government had cancelled the renewal for 179 organisations over alleged violations, while the remaining - around 5,700 - did not apply for a renewal before the deadline, 31 December. 
Oxfam said in its statement that the ""government's decision to refuse renewal"" of its licence would hurt its ""ongoing humanitarian and social work in 16 states across the country"". India's government has not commented on the matter. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has sought to squeeze foreign funding for charities and non-profit organisations based in India since coming to power in 2014.
In 2020, it amended the FCRA - changes included a ban on non-profit organisations transferring money to other groups and a ceiling on administrative costs - saying it was necessary to strengthen accountability and transparency. 
But several representatives from NGOs have accused the government of targeting its critics.
In 2020, Amnesty International halted operations in the country after accusing the government of pursuing a ""witch-hunt"" against human rights organisations.
It said its bank accounts were frozen and it had been forced to lay off staff in India.
In May 2021, BBC Newsnight reported that the changes to the FCRA were preventing non-profit organisations from supplying aid to people who desperately needed it during the deadly second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.
The legislation caused unnecessary delays to Covid relief aid due to additional form-filling and complex rules around distributing funds, office-bearers from these organisations told Newsnight.
""Even if you're working on Covid, the law makes it very difficult for you to be able to even accept foreign aid coming in without being in violation of the law,"" Aakar Patel, former head of Amnesty International India, had said at the time.
Oxfam said in a statement that it first entered India in 1951 to provide famine relief in Bihar state, though it was registered as an independent organisation only in 2008.
It said it worked closely with health departments, district administrations and local workers during the pandemic to ""provide life-saving equipment and support"".
""The Ministry of Home Affairs' decision to deny renewal of FCRA registration will severely hamper these collaborations which were providing relief to those who needed it the most during times of crisis,"" Amitabh Behar, CEO of Oxfam India.
Oxfam, one of the UK's biggest charities, employs thousands of people across more than 90 countries through its affiliate organisations.

Australian police are investigating allegations from a former Australian youth cricket player that he was raped by a team official during a 1985 tour.
Jamie Mitchell, 55, believes he was assaulted after a team doctor treated him with a sedative.
He made his allegations in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) interview.
Cricket Australia says they are co-operating with the police investigation.
Mr Mitchell has demanded the sport's governing body provide answers on what they knew of the alleged incident.
In Sunday's interview, he said he was relieved that ""finally there's some scrutiny of that 1985 tour"".
""Instead of being a highlight of my cricketing life, that tour has caused me trauma and distress over many years,"" he said in a statement shared with the BBC.
Mr Mitchell was an 18-year-old leading batsman on the Australian under-19 tour of India and Sri Lanka in 1985. The under-19s side is seen as a ""feeder"" team into the national side.
On the last night of the tour on 30 March in Colombo, he said he felt unwell and went to the team doctor, who injected him with a strong drug that knocked him out for at least 10 hours.
He said his teammates were instructed not to check up on him in his room that night, and he believes in that period he was assaulted by a leading team official. He did not give any further details in the interview on how that occurred.
""My teammates left. Anyone could have come in and had access to me,"" he told the ABC.
""Most of the guys have said they lost me for a couple of days. They remember putting me under the shower the next morning, to get me ready for the flight. They remember trying to dress me. And when we landed, I was wheeled to my parents in a wheelchair.""
Several people, including friends and family members who he confided in at the time, confirmed some details of his account to the ABC.
Mr Mitchell and some former teammates also recounted examples to the ABC of the official's ""creepy"" behaviour towards players and also foreign children brought to the team's hotel and other quarters.
Australian Federal Police are also investigating those allegations of wider misconduct, the ABC reported. Police declined to answer questions from the BBC, saying they did not provide comment on individual cases.
Mr Mitchell said he decided to seek answers from Cricket Australia last August after seeing a team picture online. He also reported to Sport Integrity Australia - the government's corruption and abuse watchdog - who contacted federal police.
Mr Mitchell and other cricketers are calling on Cricket Australia to provide transparency over what they knew of the allegations.
The cricketers allege the administrators at the time ignored reports of the official's behaviour despite appointing him as a leading official of a youth side.
They say the board at the time also did not respond to a letter of complaint from the team's players' families after the tour documenting players' grievances with the team official.
Mr Mitchell has called for Cricket Australia to release his medical records from the tour. He says the board needs to explain why the team official left professional cricket soon after the tour.
""Cricket Australia has a chance to distinguish itself by facing up to this issue and doing the right thing. And that means transparency, starting with proper answers to many questions.""
Cricket Australia said it had been in contact with Mr Mitchell. The body told Australia's Nine newspapers that it will take responsibility for allegations of abuse on past tours and matches. 
The organisation however is yet to sign up to Australia's national redress scheme for abuse victims which mandates compensation standards.

93;Omicron: Will schools stay open in January?;['2022-01-02T07:57:15.000Z'];['BBC News'];['coronavirus lockdown measures', 'schools', 'coronavirus testing', 'omicron variant', 'impact of the covid-19 pandemic on children', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['secretary', 'power', 'omicron', 'stay', 'pupils', 'open', 'message', 'saying', 'schools', 'nadhim', 'zahawi'];"
Schools across the UK are re-opening this week, with a variety of Covid restrictions in place.
How will they cope with the expected post-Christmas surge in Omicron cases among pupils and staff? And will they be able to remain fully open?
It's difficult to predict, and it will be different from region to region, and nation to nation.
Under current guidance, UK schools are expected to offer in-person teaching to all age groups this term, with effective online provision for pupils who are off isolating.
In England, the government's message is schools will stay open come what may, with Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi saying it would do ""everything in its power"" to keep pupils in class.
Nonetheless, he is reported to be in constant communication with the prime minister over the issue.
The Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland governments are also committed to doing what they can to keep education face-to-face.
England's measures include:  
But these measures are the least stringent of all UK nations. 
Face masks have now been reintroduced into England's secondary school classrooms, bringing them in line with the other three nations. Previously they were only required in communal areas and corridors.
In Wales, schools are getting an extra two days to make safety preparations, some on top of planned training days. All Welsh schools are expected to be open by 10 January, however.
Pupils in Wales are advised to take three Covid tests weekly - rather than the two elsewhere - and start and finish times are being staggered.
In Scotland, there is social distancing, pupils are separated into groupings where possible, and teachers are required to wear masks when in close contact with pupils.
Broadly, there are two main risk factors: that infections among teachers and other school staff could lead to class and even school closures, and secondly, the prospect of pupils bringing Covid back after family get-togethers following the Christmas break.
Before the first school lockdown in March 2020, schools struggled as increasing numbers of staff went off sick.
Because schools need a minimum number of staff to teach classes, if levels fall below that, classes have to be cancelled.
Towards the end of term, some schools in England were sending classes and year groups home for this reason. And in several parts of Wales, remote learning replaced face-to-face teaching in schools completely.
Supply teachers who usually cover periods of sickness are likely to be in short supply due to the high levels of absence.
Many teachers are already working in tutoring organisations as part of education recovery plans.
Another problem is the rise in the cost of hiring temporary staff due to the shortage.
England's education secretary made a plea for retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill staffing gaps, but agencies say they are unlikely to be in place for January.
Infected pupils returning after the Christmas break risk triggering even more infections.
The start-of-term testing regime aims to pick up cases before young people are back in class.
However, secondary pupils were meant to be testing themselves regularly for the whole of last term, and yet Covid absences rose dramatically in the weeks before Christmas. 
Testing statistics from early December show only a minority of pupils were doing this.
In England, recent figures show the Covid absence rate was 2.9% in state schools on 9 December. In Scotland it was 3.7% a few days later.
Under England's guidelines, a school must get in touch with its local public health officials if five pupils, teachers or staff in close contact test positive for Covid in a 10-day period.
Then school management must work with local health officials to mitigate the spread of disease.
Measures include: 
Short-term attendance restrictions, such as sending home a class or year group can now be used only in extreme cases, ""where all other risk mitigations"" have failed, and under public health advice.
At the end of the autumn term, this level of concern was reached in at least 30 local-authority areas and classes were sent home.
Schools have to have remote-learning provision in case of absence or closures, and many have really stepped up their game on this.
Many schools told the BBC at the end of December their online learning provision was ready to go in the event that they could not open fully in the new year.
Some schools sent pupils home with laptops and learning packs in case of emergency closures.
While vaccinations are not 100% guarantee against infection, they should give extra protection from disease, which is generally regarded as mild in young people.
According to an Office for National Statistics survey, 50% of adults in Great Britain said 12-to-15-year-olds in their households were vaccinated by 12 December.
But that leaves half unvaccinated. 
Ventilation is one of the key measures designed to keep schools safe from Covid spread.
Some 300,000 carbon dioxide (CO2) monitors were promised for schools in England to help identify areas with poor ventilation. But teaching unions have complained this does not solve the problem.
The Scottish government gave £100m to local councils to help fund Covid improvements, including hygiene measures and ventilation.
The Welsh government has a £6m programme to increase air circulation and purity. It includes providing 30,000 CO2 sensors and 1,800 ozone disinfecting machines.

94;Omicron: When can I have a booster jab and how do I book one?;['2021-12-31T11:31:10.000Z'];['BBC News'];['coronavirus vaccines', 'moderna', 'vaccination', 'pfizer', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic', 'astrazeneca'];['children', 'omicron', 'walkin', 'jab', 'pfizer', 'offered', 'vaccine', 'book', 'online', 'uk', 'booster', 'second'];"
The New Year booster target has been met across the UK, according to government ministers.
The goal of offering all eligible adults a booster by 31 December was in response to the Omicron variant. Other measures include approval for a low-dose vaccine to be offered to vulnerable primary school children.
In England boosters are available to over-18s - three months after the second dose. (Boosters can be booked after two months).
Some walk-in appointments may be available - depending on where you live. 
In Scotland boosters can be booked online.
In Wales people should wait to be invited, with older and higher-risk people being prioritised.
In Northern Ireland people aged 18 to 29 can go to walk-in hubs, and make booster appointments. 
Early studies from UK researchers suggest a booster vaccine - on top of the first two jabs - will provide 80-85% protection against Omicron (compared with 97% against Delta).
More antibodies are developed thanks to the booster, giving the body stronger defences against the virus. 
It makes it harder for Omicron to infect the body, although current vaccines are still not a perfect match.
Your booster will be a single dose of either Pfizer or Moderna - regardless of which vaccine you received before.
If you tested positive for Covid recently, you should wait four weeks (28 days) from the date of the test before having your booster.
You shouldn't have the booster if you have a severe illness or high fever, but Pfizer and Moderna say a mild fever or a cold are not reasons to delay.  
The vaccines do not give you an infection and will not cause positive results on a lateral flow or PCR test.
A low-dose version of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for five to 11-year-olds with health conditions that put them at greater risk from catching Covid. 
Primary school children who live with clinically vulnerable adults should also be offered a jab, government vaccine advisers said.
It is not yet clear when children would get the doses.
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation also recommended the normal booster dose should be offered to children aged:
All children aged 12 and over are being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab. They can usually have a second dose 12 weeks after the first.
Not in the UK, although a number of European countries have tightened restrictions for the unvaccinated.
However, all front-line NHS staff in England (with some exceptions) must be fully vaccinated by 1 April.
Care home staff in England must already be vaccinated (unless exempt).
Across the UK, Covid passports are required to enter some venues.
You can still book your first or second jab. You need to wait eight weeks between the first and second.
In particular, the government wants unvaccinated pregnant women to come forward.
The most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.
They are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.

There are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. 
And a very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the Pfizer vaccine.
You should discuss any existing serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated.

95;Richard Leakey - fossil expert, conservationist and politician;['2022-01-03T15:13:06.000Z'];['BBC News'];['conservation', 'kenya'];['leakey', 'recognised', 'troubles', 'fossil', 'conservationist', 'politician', 'real', 'richard', 'man', 'questioned', 'pull', 'tough', 'president', 'long', 'supporters', 'expert'];"
Richard Leakey, who has died days after celebrating his 77th birthday, was a pugnacious man whose achievements were as remarkable as they were diverse.
Born on 19 December 1944 in Kenya's capital Nairobi, he was a world-famous fossil expert, author and conservationist, as well as being an opposition MP, anti-corruption campaigner, economic reformer, and head of the country's civil service.
He was beaten up, threatened and badly injured in a plane crash which saw him lose both his legs. 
""I think pressure probably suits me,"" Leakey once said with urbane understatement.
His first job was studying fossils. His parents, Louis and Mary, were famous archaeologists and palaeontologists who spent decades exploring Kenya's Rift Valley, searching for the origins of mankind.
In his 20s, Leakey almost eclipsed his parents' work, making his own important finds and writing books.
In the late 1980s, Leakey switched careers to take over as head of Kenya's Wildlife Service (KWS) at a time when the organisation was close to collapse and poachers were busy wiping out the country's entire elephant and rhino populations.
Energetic, ruthless and seemingly incorruptible, Leakey told his rangers to shoot poachers on sight and organised the public burning of a huge cache of ivory as a publicity stunt to draw global attention to the threat faced by elephants.
""People were genuinely shocked that ivory was causing elephants to become extinct,"" he told the BBC's Vivienne Nunis in an interview in September 2021.
Leakey's methods were successful but his combative style earned him plenty of enemies. It was a pattern that would be repeated again and again.
When, in 1993, the single-engine plane he was flying lost power and crashed, many speculated that it was sabotage. Both of his legs were amputated below the knee.
In 1994 Leakey changed careers once again, quitting the KWS to enter the equally ruthless world of Kenyan politics and helping to form an opposition party called Safina to campaign for multi-party democracy.
""Looking back at my careers, the political side of my life was most rewarding in terms of the country,"" he told the BBC.
But it was far from being an easy ride.
On one occasion he was whipped by hired thugs. President Moi described him as a racist, an atheist and a foreigner.
But in 1999 President Moi shocked the country by appointing Leakey as head of Kenya's civil service, and of a so-called dream team of reformers hired to rescue a country branded one of the world's most corrupt, from a deepening economic crisis.
Supporters said Leakey had been recognised by the president as the only man tough enough and honest enough to pull Kenya out of its troubles, but questioned whether he would last long enough in the job to do any real good.
Critics said the appointment of a white man with no university education was an insult to Kenyans and one which had clearly been orchestrated by colonial mentalities still lurking in the IMF and World Bank.
In his new job Leakey certainly helped to improve relations between Kenya and international lending institutions. His appointment may well have been crucial in persuading the IMF to resume lending the government money.
For a while Leakey enjoyed unprecedented popularity as his dream team started a radical overhaul of the country's bloated, corrupt, nepotistic bureaucracy.
But as usual, Leakey ran into trouble. Some complained again about his uncanny ability to make unnecessary enemies. Others said his anti-corruption drive was threatening the interests of too many powerful figures. Leakey stepped down in 2001 - without giving any public explanation.
Leakey said he planned to retire from active political life. He wanted instead to grow grapes on his farm in the Rift Valley. 
But in 2015, he returned to public life with current President Uhuru Kenyatta appointing him as chairman of the board of the KWS. He brokered a controversial deal that allowed a Chinese-funded railway line to be built through the Nairobi National Park.
""We cannot say to the people of Kenya: 'Oh the railway can't come through Nairobi Park so you won't have a railway for five years',"" he was quoted as saying at the time.
More recently, his focus had moved to what he saw as the biggest environmental threat - climate change.
""We've created a terrible mess,"" he said.
He feared that Kenya's national parks would one day cease to exist because they ""would have dried out or washed out"".
""Poaching, I think we can deal with. But habitat loss and human expansion to encroach on water systems and forests and pollute the air - no, I don't see anything being done in Africa,"" Leakey said. 
He died with his dream of building a museum on the edges of Kenya's Rift Valley, to celebrate evolution and the common history from Africa that all humans share, unfulfilled. 
""I want to build a cathedral of life, with no God,"" he said. 
""We are one species, we came out of Lake Turkana three million years ago and we have to recognise we're all in the same house,"" he said.
Having lived in Kenya all his life, Leakey also called for greater investment in Africa to help create jobs, which he said would allow the continent to ""leap ahead"".
""I'm full of confidence that we have the human resources, Africa has just got to be given a little bit of a lift.""

96;S Korea says man who crossed back to North is gymnast defector;['2022-01-03T13:10:35.000Z'];['BBC News'];['asia', 'north korean defectors', 'south korea', 'north korea'];['s', 'gymnast', 'known', 'reported', 'korean', 'man', 'immediately', 'yonhap', 'south', 'worked', 'defector', 'crossed', 'north', 'korea'];"
South Korea's military suspects a man who crossed the heavily fortified border into the North on New Year's Day previously defected to the South.
Officials believe he is a gymnast who jumped the barbed wire fence into South Korea in 2020.
It is not clear why he made the perilous return crossing, or if he is alive or dead. 
North Korea has implemented a shoot-on-sight policy at the border to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
Thousands of North Koreans have resettled in South Korea, but crossings through the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), which separates the two countries, are rare. Most make their way via China.
Instances of defections from South to North are rarer still, with only a handful of cases recorded in recent years. 
This video can not be played
South Korean troops were sent to investigate on New Year's Day after surveillance cameras issued an alert that someone was roaming within the military border zone at a point on the east coast.
They could not find the man but discovered he had crossed into North Korea several hours later. 
Citing surveillance footage, a high-level military official confirmed to the BBC that it was indeed the same man who had earlier crossed from North to South Korea in November 2020, using a similar route. 
The man, believed to be in his 30s, worked as a cleaner in South Korea, the Yonhap news agency reported. At the time he was detained, he said he was a North Korean gymnast. Other details about him were not immediately known.
""Footage showed he had a identical look and dress as the person who defected from the North in 2020,"" a defence ministry official told reporters.
Military chiefs in Seoul said at the weekend they did not know if the person observed crossing was still alive but had sent a message to the North asking for them to be protected. 
North Korea acknowledged receiving the message, but there are no details about the man's fate or his possible motives for returning. An investigation is under way into how he could have made his crossing undetected. 
The border between North and South Korea is filled with landmines and surrounded by electric and barbed wire fencing. Surveillance cameras and armed guards are supposed to be on alert 24 hours a day. 
Defence officials in Seoul had pledged to overhaul the border defence system after similar breaches in the past.

An Israeli wildlife photographer has captured a remarkable momentary image of a flock of birds forming the shape of a spoon with a heap of sugar.
The illusion happened during what is known as a murmuration, where thousands of starlings fly and swoop in clusters.
Albert Keshet also snapped what appeared to be the spoon bending, posting it on social media.
The images caught the attention of famed Israeli spoon bender Uri Geller, who has framed them in his museum.
Mr Keshet took the images when he went on an early morning excursion to a spot in the northern Jordan Valley to photograph wild plants and birds.
""When I was in the valley looking for birds, I met the flocks of starlings. I stayed there for about five or six hours, watching and following them in order to capture some beautiful pictures,"" he told the BBC.
""At one point they began to ascend to the sky and began the dance of starlings. To my huge surprise, in the space of only about five seconds the starlings formed the shape of the spoon. They held it for a few seconds then the shape changed to a bent spoon - just like the one Uri Geller is famous for!
""In the 10 years that I have been travelling and taking photos, this is one of the most amazing pictures of starlings I have ever taken!""
After posting the images on social media, Mr Keshet was flooded with messages from people expressing amazement. 
Among them was Uri Geller, who is renowned for bending spoons apparently with the power of his mind. He called it a ""phenomenal unique never again moment"", and a ""natural gift"" for his 75th birthday just days earlier.
The self-described ""mystifier"" and psychic has placed the blown-up images in his recently opened museum in Jaffa, in southern Tel Aviv.

Airport staff in Mauritius have found a newborn baby boy abandoned in the rubbish bin toilet of a plane's toilet.
A 20-year-old woman from Madagascar, suspected of having given birth on the flight, was arrested.
The Air Mauritius plane, which arrived from Madagascar, landed at Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport on 1 January.
Airport officers made the discovery when they screened the plane for a routine customs check. 
They rushed the baby to a public hospital for treatment. 
The woman suspected of being the child's mother, who initially denied the boy was hers, was made to undergo a medical examination which confirmed that she had just given birth. 
She was placed under police surveillance at the hospital. 
Both she and the baby are said to be doing well.
The Malagasy woman, who arrived in Mauritius on a two-year work permit, will be questioned after her release from the hospital and charged with abandoning a newborn.

99;Bulli Bai: India app that put Muslim women up for sale is shut;['2022-01-03T08:46:56.000Z'];['BBC News'];['islamophobia', 'asia', 'online abuse', 'india'];['bulli', 'app', 'india', 'opinion', 'planned', 'nazia', 'targeted', 'spokesperson', 'muslim', 'women', 'speak', 'bai', 'sale', 'sulli', 'told', 'shut', 'summer'];"
Police in two Indian states have registered cases after an app shared photos of more than 100 Muslim women saying they were on ""sale"".
The accused include developers of the app and Twitter handles that shared the images and content. 
The open source app - Bulli Bai - was hosted on web platform GitHub, which has since taken it down.
This was the second attempt in months to harass Muslim women in India by ""auctioning"" them online.
In July, an app and website called ""Sulli Deals"" created profiles of more than 80 Muslim women - using photos they uploaded online - and described them as ""deals of the day"".
In both cases, there was no real sale of any kind - the purpose is to degrade and humiliate Muslim women by sharing their personal images. 
Sulli is a derogatory Hindi slang term right-wing Hindu trolls use for Muslim women, and ""bulli"" is also pejorative. 
Journalist Ismat Ara, whose name and photo appeared on the Bulli Bai app, filed a police complaint over the weekend in Delhi. It was against unidentified people and charges included sexual harassment and promoting enmity on grounds of religion. 
Police in Mumbai filed a second case against several Twitter handles and the developers of the app based on a complaint from another woman on the Bulli Bai list.
It included several journalists, activists, an award-winning Bollywood actor and even the mother of a university student who went missing in 2016. 
Many of the women whose photos were uploaded on the Bulli Bai app tweeted over the weekend that they felt ""traumatised"" and ""horrified"".
Almost six months later, the police haven't made any arrests in the Sulli Deals case.
Ms Asra told Al Jazeera that the lack of progress in the investigation didn't inspire much confidence.
""It is indeed disappointing to see the impunity with which such hate-mongers continue to target Muslims women, without fear of any sanction whatsoever,"" she wrote in her complaint.
Information and technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Saturday that GitHub had blocked the user who uploaded the app, and police were co-ordinating with cyber agencies for ""further action"". 
Priyanka Chaturvedi, a lawmaker from the Shiv Sena party, tweeted in response: ""Besides blocking the platform punishing the offenders creating such sites is important.""
She told ANI news agency that the new app was created because the makers of Sulli Deals hadn't been punished yet.
The National Commission for Women tweeted that its chairperson had asked the Delhi Police commissioner to inform it ""at the earliest"" about the action taken in the case.
Satej Patil, home minister of Maharashtra state, criticised digital platforms such as GitHub for being ""rife with misogyny and communal hatred"".
He also tweeted asking the federal government about the progress of the investigation into the Sulli Deals case.
A 2018 Amnesty International report on online harassment in India showed that the more vocal a woman was, the more likely she was to be targeted - the scale of this increased for women from religious minorities and disadvantaged castes. 
""It sent chills down my spine,"" one of the women whose name was on the Sulli Deals list told the BBC's Geeta Pandey at the time.
Critics say trolling against Muslim women has worsened in recent years in India's polarised political climate. 
""This targeted and planned attack is an attempt to take away the mic from the educated Muslim women who express their opinion and speak out against Islamophobia,"" Nazia Erum, author and former spokesperson of Amnesty in India, told the BBC after the Sulli Deals story last summer.

100;Turkey's inflation hits 36% amid financial turmoil;['2022-01-03T14:42:06.000Z'];['BBC News'];['turkish lira crisis', 'recep tayyip erdogan'];['factors', 'rate', 'remained', 'past', 'amid', 'target', 'official', 'prices', 'forecast', 'financial', 'hits', '36', 'turmoil', 'inflation', 'temporary', 'turkeys'];"
Turkey's annual inflation rate has soared to a 19-year high, underlining the country's financial turmoil and alarm over its president's policies. 
Prices hit more than 36% December as the cost of transport, food and other staples ate into household budgets.
Most central banks raise interest rates to help cool inflation but Turkey has gone the other way.
It has meant a collapse in the value of the lira, as Tayyip Erdogan prioritises exports over currency stability.
The lira shed 44% of its value against the dollar last year, and fell another 5% on Monday before recovering to trade flat. 
The drop in the lira has made the price of inflation-fuelling imports more expensive, ranging from energy to many of the raw materials Turkey's manufacturers turn into exports.
Mr Erdogan has described interest rates as ""the mother and father of all evil,"" and has used more unorthodox policy to try to dampen prices including intervening in foreign exchange markets. 
In a speech on Monday he said Turkey was ""going through a transformation in economy and rising to the next league"".
He said the nation is ""reaping the fruits especially in exports of our country's efforts and hard work in the past 20 years to bolster our foreign trade"". 
One economist forecast that inflation could reach as high as 50% by the spring unless the direction of monetary policy was reversed.
""Rates should be immediately and aggressively hiked because this is urgent,"" said Ozlem Derici Sengul, founding partner at Spinn Consulting, in Istanbul. But she accepted the central bank was unlikely to act.
Mr Erdogan overhauled the central bank's leadership last year. The bank has slashed rates to 14% from 19% since September.
The subsequent accelerating surge in prices and drop in the lira have upended household and company budgets. 
There were pictures last month of people queuing for subsidised bread in Istanbul, where local officials have said the cost of living was up 50% in a year.
The cost of living is expected to rise further, especially after recent hikes in the price of electricity and gas bills of around 50% and 25% respectively.
The central bank has argued that temporary factors have been driving prices, and had forecast in October it would end the year at 18.4%. The bank's official inflation target is 5%, but the rate has remained in the double digits for the past two years.
To curb the lira's weakness, Mr Erdogan unveiled a scheme three weeks ago in which the state protects converted local deposits from losses versus hard currencies. That sparked a sharp 50% rally in the lira with support from the central bank.
But the lira then sank again last week, prompting a call on Friday from the president for people to keep all their savings in lira and shift gold into banks.
The economic turmoil has hit President Erdogan's opinion poll ratings ahead of planned elections scheduled for no later than mid-2023.

101;China: Concern over Xi'an residents' midnight quarantine;['2022-01-03T10:32:32.000Z'];['BBC News'];['china', 'self-isolation', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['night', 'proper', 'quarantine', 'concern', 'placed', 'xian', 'thousand', 'resident', 'posted', 'read', 'necessities', 'transfer', 'residents', 'midnight', 'china'];"
A midnight eviction of some residents in the Chinese city of Xi'an who were later taken to quarantine facilities has sparked concern on social media.
Xi'an is at the epicentre of China's current Covid outbreak, and authorities have enacted drastic measures.
All 13 million residents are confined to their homes and cannot leave to buy food or supplies.
Authorities are hoping to eliminate the outbreak before Lunar New Year and the Winter Olympics in Beijing next month.
The situation in Xi'an has led to heightened tensions, with many taking to social media in recent days to complain.
Authorities have been providing free food to households, but some have said their supplies are running low or that they had yet to receive aid.
In the latest incident, residents in the Mingde 8 Yingli housing compound in the south of Xi'an were reportedly told just after midnight on 1 January that they had to leave their homes and go to quarantine facilities. 
It is thought this was due to recent reported infections in the community. Multiple Chinese outlets reported that locals had mixed while getting tested for Covid.
It is not known exactly how many people were transferred, but one person on social media reported seeing 30 buses outside the compound, while another claimed up to a thousand people were moved. 
A number of people said they had been left waiting on the buses for several hours. Those taken to the quarantine facilities included elderly people, young children and pregnant women, according to reports. A picture of an old man standing alone in the cold wintry night as he waited to be transferred went viral, sparking pity online.
Some people posted images of the isolation facilities claiming the amenities were too basic, it was too cold, and that they had not been given food. 
""There is nothing here, just basic necessities... Nobody has come to check up on us, what kind of quarantine is this? They did a big transfer of us, more than a thousand people, in the night and many of us are elderly people and children. They didn't make any proper arrangements and so they just carelessly placed us [here],""  read one comment posted by an affected resident.
It has sparked widespread concern on social media platform Weibo, with many questioning the necessity of the move as residents had been quarantining in their homes for around two weeks. 
They were initially given some freedom to buy food, but last week Xi'an authorities tightened the rules further and mandated that residents could leave their homes only to get tested for Covid.
The incident is one of several that have emerged on Chinese social media in recent days showing tensions and frayed nerves in Xi'an, which has reported 1,600 cases since 9 December. 
Over the weekend, a video of a man being beaten by epidemic prevention workers for leaving his home to buy steamed buns went viral. Authorities in the city later confirmed the workers had been punished.
In another incident, a group of students were left stranded in Xi'an after taking the postgraduate entrance examination. One student claimed that she had eaten instant noodles for two weeks and only had five packs left. 
Last week the government pledged to ensure people have access to food. A number of people have since taken to social media to share images of supplies they received. 
""Thank you for the instant noodles sent by the government. Dinner is on!"" one person wrote on chat app WeChat. 
But others say they are still having trouble accessing necessities. 
The city is also in the process of building facilities to house Covid patients. Three hospitals have already been built, with another one currently under construction. 
According to Chinese state media, the new hospitals will add 3,000 beds for Covid patients. 
Zhang Canyou, from China's infectious disease control agency, told state media that they had started to see ""some positive changes"".

A devastating fire that swept through South Africa's Houses of Parliament in Cape Town has reignited - hours after it was said to be under control. 
Flames have been billowing from the building's roof. Firefighters are at the scene, trying to douse the blaze.
The fire first broke out on Sunday, causing extensive damage to the building. 
Police have arrested a suspect who will appear in court on Tuesday on charges of arson, housebreaking and theft.
Authorities had warned that flare-ups would be possible because of carpets and wooden floors in the building. 
""The void beneath the roof sheeting of the National Assembly [lower chamber] is on fire,"" city officials said.
On Sunday, President Cyril Ramaphosa called the fire a ""terrible and devastating event"".
The parliament is not currently in session because of the holidays, and no-one was injured.
The building is home to thousands of treasures including historic books, photographs and important works of art. There is particular concern that the valuable Keiskamma Tapestry, which is 120m (394ft) long and documents South Africa's history, may have been damaged or destroyed.

103;What are the accusations against Prince Andrew?;['2022-01-02T21:25:04.000Z'];['BBC News'];['prince andrew, duke of york', 'jeffrey epstein death', 'uk royal family', 'jeffrey epstein', 'united states'];['recruiting', 'andrew', 'trafficking', 'sexual', 'maxwell', 'prince', 'duke', 'sexually', 'paedophile', 'need', 'accusations', 'york', 'underage'];"
The Duke of York has been accused of sexual abuse in a civil case in the US. His former friend, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been found guilty of recruiting and trafficking underage girls to be sexually abused by the late billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who was also an ex-associate of the duke. Here's what you need to know.
In court documents, Virginia Giuffre says she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by Jeffrey Epstein from the age of 16.
Part of her abuse involved being lent out to other powerful men - including Prince Andrew, she alleges.
Ms Giuffre says the duke sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was under the age of 18.
The first time was in 2001 in London. In a 2019 interview with the BBC, she said she was introduced to Prince Andrew by Epstein and his then-girlfriend, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who took them to a nightclub.
Ms Giuffre recounts being told by Ms Maxwell as a 17-year-old that she had to ""do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey"". 
Later that evening she says she had sex with the duke upstairs at Ms Maxwell's house in Belgravia.
On the second occasion, it is alleged that Prince Andrew abused Ms Giuffre in Epstein's mansion in New York.
And she says the duke abused her a third time on Epstein's private island, Little St James, in the US Virgin Islands.
Ms Giuffre says in the court documents that she was forced into sex by explicit or implicit threats and because she feared the powerful connections, wealth and authority of Epstein, Ms Maxwell and Prince Andrew.
She says the duke knew her age and that she was a sex-trafficking victim.
Prince Andrew has consistently denied all the allegations against him.
He said in an interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019 that he had no recollection of ever meeting Virginia Giuffre, and that her account of their London meeting, nightclub visit and sex at a house in Belgravia ""didn't happen"".
The duke says on the date she claims they met, he was looking after his children, taking Princess Beatrice to a party in Pizza Express in Woking and spending the evening at home.
But Prince Andrew said he could not explain a photo of him with his arm around Virginia Giuffre, then known as Roberts, with Ms Maxwell in the background.
Meanwhile, the prince's lawyers said that Ms Giuffre agreed in court in 2009 not to sue anyone else connected to Epstein when she settled her damages claim against the billionaire sex offender.
His lawyers said this agreement ""releases the duke and others from any and all potential liability"".
The wording of the deal had been kept confidential, but Ms Giuffre's lawyers agreed that it could be released to Prince Andrew's legal team, calling it ""irrelevant to the case"".
Ms Giuffre filed a civil case in New York in August 2021 under the state's Child Victims Act, which allows survivors of childhood sexual abuse to pursue a case which otherwise would have been barred because too much time had passed.
The case accuses Prince Andrew of sexual assault and battery on Ms Giuffre when she was 17.
Now 38, she says the three alleged instances of abuse continue to cause her ""significant emotional and psychological distress and harm"".
Prince Andrew is not facing any legal action in the UK.
The Metropolitan Police has reviewed a document released in August 2021 as part of the civil action in the US. They also reviewed information passed to them by the media in June 2021.
In both instances, the police said in October that the review was complete and no further action would be taken.
""The Metropolitan Police service continues to liaise with other law enforcement agencies who lead the investigation into matters related to Jeffrey Epstein,"" the force added.
Prince Andrew said he first met Epstein, a billionaire hedge fund manager, in 1999 through Epstein's then-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.
In 2000, the duke says he invited Ms Maxwell - the daughter of media tycoon Robert Maxwell - to Windsor Castle, with Epstein attending as her ""plus-one"".
The couple also visited the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk for a shooting weekend later that year.
Prince Andrew told the BBC he had travelled on Epstein's private plane, visited his private island, and stayed at his homes in Palm Beach and New York.
Allegations against Epstein first began to surface in 2005 and the following year an arrest warrant was issued against him for sexual assault of a minor.
In July 2006, Prince Andrew invited Epstein and Ms Maxwell to the 18th birthday of his daughter, Princess Beatrice. But he says he only became aware of the allegations later that year, prompting him to cut off contact.
Epstein was jailed in Florida in 2008 for soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution under a controversial plea deal that saw him released in 2010.
Prince Andrew visited him in New York for four days in December 2010, but said the purpose of the visit was to break off their friendship.
When Epstein's secret plea deal was exposed, it sparked outrage. Further charges in New York followed, alleging that Epstein had exploited a ""vast network"" of underage girls for sex, with some as young as 14.
But after a month in prison awaiting trial, he was found dead in his cell in August 2019 - with the New York medical examiner ruling it suicide.
Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested by the FBI in July 2020 and held in jail until her trial. In December 2021, she was found guilty of recruiting and trafficking underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.
Maxwell was found guilty on five of the six charges she faced - including the most serious - of sex trafficking a minor. 
She was found not guilty of one count - enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts.
The British former socialite, 60, could spend the rest of her life behind bars, but a date for her sentencing has not yet been set.
The month-long trial in New York included testimony from four women who described being abused by Epstein between 1994 and 2004. 
Shortly after the verdict, Maxwell's legal team said they were working on an appeal. ""We firmly believe in Ghislaine's innocence,"" one of her lawyers, Bobbi Sternheim, told reporters outside the court.
Maxwell also faces a separate trial on two perjury charges, which each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
In these cases, she is accused of lying under oath during a 2016 deposition for a lawsuit filed against Epstein by one of the accusers, Virginia Giuffre.
She is likely to be in court for this trial next year.

104;Covid-19: French MPs get death threats over support for vaccine pass;['2022-01-03T16:13:44.000Z'];['BBC News'];['france', 'coronavirus vaccines', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['tv', 'death', 'mps', 'threats', 'covid19', 'reported', 'support', 'french', 'supporting', 'vaccine', 'deterred', 'pass', 'bfm', 'interview'];"
Several French MPs say they have received death threats as they debate a Covid-19 pass that would bar the unvaccinated from much of public life.
The government is seeking to pass a law that would require people to show proof of vaccination to access public venues and transport with some exceptions.
The legislation is expected to be approved in a vote this week but has angered vaccine opponents.
France has one of the highest Covid vaccination rates in the EU.
At least 91% of the adult population have been fully jabbed, according to the French government.
On Sunday Agnès Firmin Le Bodo of the centre-right Agir party tweeted an email she received containing graphic threats to kill her over her support for the vaccination pass.
""Our democracy is in danger,"" wrote Ms Firmin Le Bodo, who is also a pharmacist and vaccinates people against Covid.
In an interview with BFM TV, she said she had reported the threats to the police and would not be deterred from supporting the vaccine pass.
Another MP, Naïma Moutchou of the Horizons party, shared a similar tweet which included a screenshot of an emailed threat.
In parliament on Monday, Health Minister Olivier Véran condemned the death threats and the ""selfishness"" of vaccine opponents.
Last week Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said police would strengthen protections for elected officials ahead of the vote on vaccine passes.
Barbara Bessot Ballot of the ruling En Marche! party said MPs had received messages threatening to kill them for ""attacking our freedom"".
""Those death threats are unacceptable,"" she wrote on Twitter.
Throughout the pandemic, critics have accused French President Emmanuel Macron's government of violating freedoms by imposing Covid rules. Protests against these rules have been held regularly.
For months France has asked people to show either proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test to access many public venues.
But the French government has decided to remove the option to show a negative test in response to record increases in infections, driven by the highly contagious Omicron and Delta variants of Covid.
The government is aiming to bring the vaccine pass into force in mid-January, once it has been approved by parliament.
Most parties back the vaccine pass, which is expected to be passed by the lower house early this week, before being debated in the Senate on Wednesday.

England will continue with its Plan B Covid measures amid growing pressures on the NHS, Boris Johnson has said.
The prime minister said it would be ""folly"" to think the pandemic was over and pressure on hospitals would be ""considerable"" over the coming weeks.
However, he added the country was in a ""much better position"" than this time last year thanks to vaccinations.
The PM stressed Omicron looks less severe than other variants, despite it being ""incredibly transmissible"".
Speaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in Aylesbury, he said the ""mixture of things we're doing at the moment"" were the correct measures.
He said this included continuing with Plan B, which includes mask wearing in certain indoor settings and guidance to work from home where possible, ensuring it is taken ""seriously"" by people.
These measures are due to expire on 26 January, although they are expected to be reviewed on Wednesday. 
BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said to expect the status quo to rumble on until the end of the month, when the picture should be clearer as to what impact Christmas and New Year mixing had.
On Monday, 157,758 new coronavirus cases were reported across England and Scotland, with data from Wales and Northern Ireland to be reported after the holiday weekend.
A further 42 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in England.
Mr Johnson added people should be ""sensible"" and take a rapid test before going to see people they do not usually meet, as well as getting their first, second and booster jabs.
""We've got to make sure we look after our NHS in any way that we can"" he said, adding: ""I appreciate the pressures that our hospitals are under.""
As NHS trusts warn of staffing pressures, Mr Johnson said the government was looking at what it could do to ""move people into those areas that are particularly badly affected"". 
He said: ""Looking at the pressures on the NHS in the next couple of weeks and maybe longer... looking at the numbers of people who are going to be going into hospital, it would be absolute folly to say that this thing is all over now bar the shouting.
""We've got to remain cautious, we've got to stick with plan B, we've got to get boosted.""
Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said on Twitter it was ""very clear"" the NHS in the rest of the country was ""now coming under the significant pressure London has been encountering"".
Many trusts said the biggest challenge was rising staff absence, he said, so some were declaring critical incidents to manage those.
Parts of the health service are in crisis, Matthew Taylor, NHS Confederation chief executive, warned.
""Some hospitals are making urgent calls to exhausted staff to give up rest days and leave to enable them to sustain core services. Many more hospitals are having to ban visitors to try to reduce the spread of infection,"" he said.
The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own Covid restrictions.
It comes as secondary school children are due to head back to school this week, with testing and mask wearing in classrooms part of their return. 
On a new requirement for masks, Mr Johnson agreed with Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi and said the government ""won't keep them on a day more than is necessary.""
Mr Johnson said he did not ""like the idea of having face masks in classrooms any more than anybody else does"", but said there is an ""increasing body of scientific support"" for the idea that face masks contain transmission. 
Earlier on Monday, Mr Zahawi defended plans to require secondary pupils to wear masks during lessons until 26 January, adding ministers were determined to keep schools open after learning a ""painful lesson"" from earlier closures.
He confirmed all secondary pupils in England would be tested before returning this week.

106;Prince Andrew accuser’s 2009 deal with Jeffrey Epstein made public;['2022-01-03T20:23:19.000Z'];['By Dominic Casciani'];['prince andrew, duke of york', 'jeffrey epstein'];['deal', 'lawyers', 'sue', 'settlement', 'offender', 'means', 'legal', 'public', 'prince', 'epstein', 'jeffrey', 'accusers', 'mention', 'say', 'andrew', 'potential', '2009'];"
Virginia Giuffre agreed not to sue anyone connected to Jeffrey Epstein who could be described as a ""potential defendant"", a 2009 damages settlement against the sex offender shows.
The document, disclosed by a New York court, reveals the financier paid her $500,000 (£371,000) to end her claim. 
Ms Giuffre is suing the Duke of York in a civil case for allegedly sexually assaulting her 20 years ago, when she was a teenager.
He has consistently denied the claims.
The document was released ahead of a critical hearing on Tuesday in the civil case involving Prince Andrew.
Ms Giuffre alleges she was trafficked to the prince by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. 
Although the settlement does not mention the prince by name, his lawyers say this 2009 deal means she cannot sue him - because she agreed to end all legal action against anyone connected to the offender who could be described as a ""potential defendant"". 
A source in Prince Andrew's legal team said ""Giuffre referred to 'royalty' in her 2009 claim [against Jeffrey Epstein] and that means Prince Andrew was covered by the deal"".
Epstein died in prison in 2019, while Maxwell was last week convicted of recruiting and trafficking young girls to be abused by the late financier.
But Ms Giuffre's legal team say the terms of the Florida settlement are irrelevant to her case against the Prince - which alleges sexual abuse by the royal in New York, London and the US Virgin Islands. 
In her 2009 claim against Epstein, lawyers for Ms Giuffre said she was lured into a world of sexual abuse at his Florida home when she was a teenager. 
They added: ""In addition to being continually exploited to satisfy defendant's [Epstein] every sexual whim, [Ms Giuffre] was also required to be sexually exploited by defendant's adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen and or other professional and personal acquaintances."" 
That case never went to trial because on 17 November 2009 Jeffrey Epstein agreed to pay her $500,000 to stop it in its tracks. That deal was confidential until now - but has been made public because of its potential importance to the Prince Andrew case. 
In the document, Ms Giuffre, also referred to by her unmarried name Roberts, agreed to ""release, acquit, satisfy, and forever discharge"" Epstein and ""any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant"".
The settlement's wording says she discharges ""potential defendants"" from any US legal action, including damages claims dating ""from the beginning of the world"".
The precise meaning of that wording is expected to be the subject of intense legal arguments in New York on Tuesday.
In filings to the New York court last month, Andrew B. Brettler, the duke's lead lawyer, said the Epstein settlement's plain language would be clear once it was released to the public. 
""Epstein negotiated for this broad release, insisting that it cover any and all persons who Giuffre identified as potential targets of future lawsuits, regardless of the merit— or lack thereof —to any such claims,"" he said. 
""Giuffre's baseless claims against Prince Andrew ... must be dismissed at this stage.""
Ms Giuffre's lawyers say the Florida settlement is not relevant. 
In their own court filings they have told the court that the Epstein deal is ""outside the four corners"" of her action against Prince Andrew because it does not cover her claims against him. 
Lisa Bloom, a lawyer for alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein, described the settlement as ""one of the most bizarre"" she had ever seen, telling BBC News she thought it was ""incomprehensibly vague"".
""We want contracts to clearly specify who is released from a lawsuit and who is not,"" she said, adding that she could not see a judge releasing Prince Andrew from a lawsuit because he was not named specifically.

Gunmen tried to kill Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry during an event on Saturday to mark the anniversary of the country's independence, officials say.
The incident happened as Mr Henry took part in the ceremony at a church in the northern city of Gonaïves.
Video posted online showed the prime minister and his entourage scrambling toward their cars amid intense gunfire.
The security situation has deteriorated significantly since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse last July.
Mr Henry has pledged to crack down on powerful gangs that are blamed for a wave of kidnappings and for seizing control of much of the gas distribution around the country,  causing severe fuel shortages.
The prime minister's office said ""bandits and terrorists"" were behind the assassination attempt, and that arrest warrants had been issued for the suspects.
The office accused the group of hiding behind walls to attack the convoy and of threatening the bishop by surrounding the church, according to the Associated Press.
One person was killed and two others were injured in the gunfight between the armed men and security forces, local media reported.
The attack is another blow to the fragile administration led by Mr Henry, who became Haiti's acting head of state two weeks after Moïse was killed. The circumstances of the assassination, believed to have been carried out by a group of mercenaries, are still unclear.
No date has been announced for a vote to elect a new president.
The rise in violence and a dire economic situation, made worse by several natural disasters in recent years, have led to a growing number of Haitians seeking opportunities in other countries.

108;David Bowie: Singer's estate sells rights to his entire body of work to WCM;['2022-01-03T19:55:28.000Z'];['BBC News'];['david bowie', 'music'];['record', 'body', 'quite', 'bowie', 'singers', 'estate', 'sells', 'stream', 'entire', 'regular', 'recessionproof', 'streaming', 'rights', 'replaced', 'david', 'number', 'proving', 'think', 'wcm', 'work'];"
David Bowie's estate has sold the publishing rights to his ""entire body of work"" to Warner Chappell Music, including hundreds of songs such as Space Oddity, Changes and Let's Dance.
WCM now has global music publishing rights to his song catalogue, the singer's estate told the BBC. 
Variety suggested the deal was worth ""upwards of $250m (£185m)"", but the terms of the agreement were not given.
WCM head Guy Moot said they were ""proud"" to be ""chosen as caretakers"".
Bowie died of cancer in 2016. He was hailed as an extraordinary artist and genius in a huge global outpouring of tributes from fellow music stars, including Sir Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Brian Eno and Madonna among others.
The agreement with WCM includes the 26 studio albums released during Bowie's lifetime and the posthumous studio album release, Toy, plus the two studio albums from Tin Machine - the rock supergroup fronted by Bowie. 
Tracks released as singles from soundtracks and other projects are also included.
Given the ups and downs of the music industry over the last 20 years, the appeal of a big cheque is, perhaps, unsurprising - especially for 'heritage' acts.   
Streaming may not quite have replaced the billions lost by the decline of the CD, but it is, for many established artists, proving to be a regular, and largely recession-proof, income stream; and for record labels and a number of new firms who have entered the market, this is, they think, a lucrative asset.  
With the music industry becoming ever more complicated, with licensing deals over streaming, adverts, films, video games and online video to negotiate, the artists - or their estates and families - have a large and hassle-free deposit in the bank, and the complicated job of turning music into money is left to the experts.  
With Spotify adding 60,000 songs to its catalogue every day, the chance of a new act making a splash seems tougher than ever - legacy artists with 50 years of fame and proven sales look like a relatively safe bet.
Bowie released a total of 111 singles, averaging two per year during his career, and 51 music videos.
This deal follows huge names, including Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and Paul Simon, recently selling the rights to their music catalogues. 
Moot, who is WCM's co-chairman and chief executive, said Bowie's was ""one of the most ground-breaking, influential, and enduring catalogues in music history"", adding he had ""inspired millions of fans and countless innovators, not only in music, but across all the arts, fashion, and media"".
""These are not only extraordinary songs, but milestones that have changed the course of modern music forever,"" he said.

He described Bowie's ""vision and creative genius"" driving him to ""push the envelope, lyrically and musically - writing songs that challenged convention, changed the conversation, and have become part of the canon of global culture"". 
The executive added they were looking forward to ""tending his unparalleled body of songs with passion and care"".
WCM said the agreement followed last year's announcement of a deal between Bowie's estate and Warner Music Group [WMG], for it to oversee his full back catalogue of albums between 1968 and 1999.
""Warner Music has licensed worldwide rights to Bowie's recorded music catalogue from 1968. With this new deal with Warner Chappell, WMG is now home to Bowie's body of work as both a songwriter and recording artist,"" WCM added.
Warner Chappell Music is the global music publishing company of Warner Music Group. WCM co-chair and COO Carianne Marshall said they were ""pleased"" the estate felt they had the "" knowledge, experience, and resources to take the reins and continue to promote a collection of this stature"".
She called Bowie's music a ""living, breathing collection of timeless songs that are as powerful and resonant today as they were when they were first written"".
Allen Grubman , speaking on behalf of Bowie's estate, said: ""We are truly gratified that David Bowie's body of music will now be in the capable hands of Warner Chappell Music Publishing. We are sure they will cherish it and take care of it with the greatest level of dignity.""
Bowie's innovation was not just in the recording studio and in front of the camera - he was also involved in the world of finance. In the mid-90s, Bowie, his financial manager Bill Zysblat, and banker David Pullman came up with a new scheme to generate cash from the singer's extensive back catalogue.
In 1997, Bowie sold asset-backed securities, dubbed ""Bowie bonds"", which awarded investors a share in his future royalties for 10 years. The securities, which were bought by US insurance giant Prudential Financial for $55m, committed him to repay his new creditors out of future income, and gave a fixed annual return of 7.9%.
He struck a deal with record label EMI which allowed him to package up and sell bonds on royalties for 25 albums released between 1969 and 1990 - which included classics such as The Man Who Sold The World, Ziggy Stardust, and Heroes, according to the Financial Times.
But in 2004, rating agency Moody's Investors Services downgraded Bowie bonds to only one level above ""junk"", the lowest rating, after a downturn in the music industry.
Bowie had already predicted the decline in traditional music sales, telling the New York Times in 2002 that music would become ""like running water or electricity"".

Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has been rushed to hospital with an intestinal blockage after feeling unwell while on vacation.
The president posted a photo from his hospital bed on Twitter, saying doctors had inserted a nasogastric tube and were evaluating potential surgery.
Doctors said his condition was stable.
Mr Bolsonaro, 66, has been admitted to hospital several times since being stabbed in the abdomen during his 2018 presidential campaign. 
In his tweet, the president said he had started feeling unwell on Sunday afternoon after lunch. He was flown from the southern state of Santa Catarina, where he was vacationing, to the Vila Nova Star hospital in São Paulo.
Television images showed the president walking down the stairs of the presidential plane after landing in the early hours of Monday.
Mr Bolsonaro added that the symptoms where the same ones that had led to a four-day hospitalisation in July, saying the stabbing was the root cause of his health problems. Mr Bolsonaro was seriously wounded in the attack and has had at least four operations since.
The far-right president, who took office in 2019, plans to run for re-election in a vote scheduled to take place in October. His popularity has plummeted in recent months, amid his government's widely criticised response to the pandemic and the country's economic downturn.
Last month the president came under criticism for not interrupting his beach vacation while floods swept through the north-eastern state of Bahia, killing at least 25 people. He posted videos of himself jet-skiing through crowds of cheering supporters.

110;Elizabeth Holmes: Theranos founder convicted of fraud;['2022-01-04T00:41:42.000Z'];['BBC News'];['theranos trial', 'medical technology'];['mr', 'elizabeth', 'convicted', 'sexual', 'senior', 'relationship', 'ran', 'theranos', 'holmes', 'stand', 'fraud', 'founder', 'spoke', 'balwani', 'seven'];"
Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been found guilty of four charges of fraud at a trial in California. 
Prosecutors argued Holmes knowingly lied about her blood-testing firm and technology able to detect diseases with just a few drops of blood.
Jurors found Holmes guilty of four charges, including conspiracy to commit fraud against investors and three counts of wire fraud.
The 37-year-old could face up to 20 years in prison.
Holmes was found not guilty of four other charges, including knowingly lying to the public. The jurors were unable to reach a verdict on three other counts they were considering. 
The split verdict came after the judge said the jury, having deliberated for seven days, could deliver a partial verdict. 
Theranos, at one point valued at $9bn (£6.5bn), was once the darling of Silicon Valley.
The firm promised it would revolutionise the healthcare industry, but it began to unravel in 2015 after a Wall Street Journal investigation reported that its core blood-testing technology did not work. It was was officially shuttered in 2018. 
For nearly four months at trial, the jury of eight men and four women were presented with two starkly different accounts of the former self-made billionaire, whose downfall shook Silicon Valley.
Calling some 30 witnesses, prosecution sought to prove that Ms Holmes knew the product she was selling to investors was a sham, but remained hell-bent on the firm's success. 
At trial, multiple lab directors testified they told Holmes about the flaws in Theranos' technology but were instructed to downplay their concerns. At the same time, they said, Holmes told investors the technology was operating as planned. 
Holmes ""chose fraud over business failure. She chose to be dishonest with investors and patients"", said prosecutor Jeff Schenk in closing arguments. ""That choice was not only callous, it was criminal."" 
But the defence countered with descriptions of a dedicated and driven businesswoman, making waves in a male-dominated industry. 
""You know that at the first sign of trouble, the crooks cash out, criminals cover up and rats flee a sinking ship,"" defence attorney Kevin Downey said last week. But Holmes stayed, he said, and she ""went down with that ship when it went down"".
Testifying in her own defence, Holmes acknowledged mistakes in Theranos' operation, but maintained she never knowingly defrauded patients or investors. 
The defence also laid blame on Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, Holmes' former business partner and long-term boyfriend. 
Holmes has accused Mr Balwani, 19 years her senior, of emotional and sexual abuse. Over seven days on the stand, she described an intense relationship, in which Mr Balwani controlled how she ran Theranos, who she spoke to, how she spoke to them, and what she ate. He has denied the allegations.
Their decade-long relationship came to an end around the same time he stepped down as CEO in May 2016. He faces a separate trial next month. 
Holmes founded Theranos at age 19, shortly after dropping out of chemical engineering at Stanford University. She was able to raise more than $900m from billionaires such as media magnate Rupert Murdoch and tech mogul Larry Ellison.

111;Theranos scandal: Who is Elizabeth Holmes and why is she on trial?;['2021-08-30T23:37:24.000Z'];['By Daniel Thomas'];['rupert murdoch', 'theranos trial', 'fraud'];['los', 'trial', 'elizabeth', 'judge', 'likely', 'mother', 'legal', 'emily', 'theranos', 'holmes', 'think', 'influence', 'guilty', 'scandal'];"
She was ""the world's youngest self-made female billionaire"", trumpeted Forbes magazine. The ""next Steve Jobs"", said Inc, another business magazine that put her on the cover.
In 2014, Elizabeth Holmes, then 30 years old, was on top of the world. A Stanford University drop-out, she had founded a company valued at $9bn (£6.5bn) for supposedly bringing about a revolution in diagnosing disease. 
With a few drops of blood, Theranos promised that its Edison test could detect conditions such as cancer and diabetes quickly without the hassle of needles. Bigwigs from Henry Kissinger to general James Mattis sat on the board.
But by 2015, the seams were coming apart, and within a year, Ms Holmes was exposed as a fake. The technology she touted didn't work at all, and by 2018 the company she founded had collapsed. 
Ms Holmes, now 37, faces up to 20 years in prison if found guilty of the 12 charges of fraud against her. She has never previously told her side of the story.
Her trial, US v Elizabeth Holmes, et al, will be closely watched and she is expected to plead not guilty.
And in a twist, it emerged this weekend that her lawyers will argue that her ex-boyfriend and business partner, Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, sexually abused and emotionally controlled her at the time of the alleged crimes, impairing her mental state.
Mr Balwani, 56, who faces the same fraud charges, called the claims ""outrageous"". It will be up to a jury to decide with what sympathy or harshness to judge the woman who fooled everyone from statesmen to secretaries.
Despite being the subject of a book, HBO documentary and an upcoming TV series and film, it is still unclear why Ms Holmes took such a gamble on technology she knew didn't work.
She was raised in a comfortably well-off family in Washington DC, and was a polite but withdrawn child, according to people who knew her.
Inventor and businessman Richard Fuisz, 81, speculates there must have been immense pressure on Ms Holmes to succeed. His family lived next door to the Holmes for years but they fell out when Theranos sued him over a patent dispute in 2011 (it was later settled). 
Ms Holmes' parents spent much of their careers as bureaucrats on Capitol Hill but ""they were very interested in status"" and ""lived for connections"", he told the BBC. Her father's great great grandfather founded Fleischmann's Yeast, which changed America's bread industry, and the family was very conscious about its lineage, he said.  
At age nine, the young Elizabeth wrote a letter to her father declaring that what she ""really want[ed] out of life is to discover something new, something that mankind didn't know was possible to do"".
When she got to Stanford University in 2002 to study chemical engineering, she came up with an idea for a patch that could scan the wearer for infections and release antibiotics as needed.
At 18, she already displayed an intransigence that would apparently continue and drive the company she would found the following year. 
Phyllis Gardner, an expert in clinical pharmacology at Stanford, recalled discussing Ms Holmes's skin patch idea and telling her it ""wouldn't work"".
""She just stared through me,"" Dr Gardner told the BBC.  
""And she just seemed absolutely confident of her own brilliance. She wasn't interested in my expertise and it was upsetting.""
Months later Ms Holmes dropped out of Stanford aged 19 and launched Theranos, this time coming up with an apparently revolutionary way of testing blood from a simple finger prick. 
Powerful people were enthralled and invested without seeing audited financial accounts. 
US Treasury Secretary George Schultz, media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and America's richest family, the Waltons, were among her backers. 
The support lent her credibility, as did her demeanour.
""I knew she'd had this brilliant idea and that she had managed to convince all these investors and scientists,"" said Dr Jeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School, who met her for lunch in 2015. 
""She was self-assured, but when I asked her several questions about her technology she didn't look like she understood,"" added Dr Flier, who never formally assessed her technology. ""It seemed a bit odd but I didn't come away thinking it was a fraud.""
Dr Flier ended up inviting her to join the medical school's Board of Fellows, which he regrets, although she was removed when the scandal broke. 
It began to unravel in 2015 when a whistleblower raised concerns about Theranos's flagship testing device, the Edison. The Wall Street Journal wrote a series of damning exposes claiming the results were unreliable and that the firm had been using commercially available machines made by other manufacturers for most of its testing. 
Lawsuits piled up, partners cut ties and in 2016 US regulators banned Ms Holmes from operating a blood-testing service for two years. 
In 2018 Theranos was dissolved.
In March that year, Ms Holmes settled civil charges from financial regulators that she fraudulently raised $700m from investors. 
But three months later she was arrested, along with Mr Balwani, on criminal charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
Prosecutors claim she knowingly misled patients about the tests and vastly exaggerated the firm's performance to financial backers.
Ms Holmes was released on bail and in 2019 got married to William ""Billy"" Evans, 27, an heir to the Evans Hotel Group chain of hotels. They had a son in July this year. 
""I don't think her being a new mother will influence the trial but the judge is likely to take it into account if she is found guilty,"" said Emily D Baker, a former deputy district attorney for Los Angeles and legal commentator who is not connected to the case.
As the Theranos scandal reaches trial, commentators say it is remarkable how tightly she has clung to her original story and people who knew her say they doubt she has changed. 
According to court papers, Ms Holmes' lawyers are set to argue that ""she believed any alleged misrepresentations"" about Theranos were true and that it was a ""legitimate business generating value for investors"".
They are also likely to claim that Mr Balwani's alleged controlling behaviour ""erased her capacity to make decisions"", including her ability to ""deceive her victims"".
They say Theranos's former chief operating officer - who will be tried separately next year - controlled how she dressed, what she ate and with whom she spoke for over a decade. They will also call a psychologist specialising in sexual abuse as a witness.
Whether Ms Holmes will take the stand herself is unclear. 
""The toughest thing with any case involving fraud is proving that the person intended to defraud,"" said Ms Baker. 
""So prosecutors will have to use her texts and emails and argue that she knew the technology didn't work but said it did anyway.""

A Canadian court has awarded C$107m (£62m; $84m), plus interest, to the families of six people who died when a plane was downed near Tehran in 2020.
The family members awarded compensation by Ontario's Superior Court of Justice lost spouses, siblings, children, nieces and nephews.
Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 was hit by two missiles after taking off. Iran has said it mistook the aircraft for a US missile.
All 176 people on board died. 
They included 55 Canadians and 35 permanent residents of Canada. The relatives had filed a civil lawsuit against Iran and other officials who they say were to blame for the incident.
It was not immediately clear how the money would be collected from Iran. The relatives' lawyer, Mark Arnold, said his team would look to seize Iranian assets in Canada and abroad, which could include oil tankers.
This is the first time that compensation has been awarded to the families of the victims, CBC reports, adding that Iran did not defend itself in court.
Last year a report by the Canadian government said Iran was ""fully responsible"" for the downing of the plane, and that it had been a result of ""incompetence"" and ""recklessness"". 
Iranian authorities initially denied responsibility for the incident, which happened on 8 January 2020. But as evidence mounted, the Revolutionary Guards' Aerospace Force said an air defence unit had mistaken the Boeing 737-800 for a US missile.
Iran's air defences had been on high alert because the country had just fired ballistic missiles at two Iraqi military bases hosting US forces. That was in retaliation for the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad five days earlier.

113;Elizabeth Holmes: Has the Theranos scandal changed Silicon Valley?;['2022-01-04T00:56:41.000Z'];['By James Clayton'];['companies', 'theranos trial', 'silicon valley', 'fraud'];['changed', 'stage', 'elizabeth', 'particularly', 'looking', 'right', 'wisdom', 'valley', 'holmes', 'theranos', 'silicon', 'startup', 'substantive', 'scandal', 'technology', 'work', 'investors'];"
For years Elizabeth Holmes was the darling of Silicon Valley, a woman that could do no wrong.
The start-up she founded, Theranos, attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in investments.
Yet the company she had built was based on fantasy science.
The technology Theranos was producing - supposedly testing for hundreds of diseases with a pin prick of blood - seemed incredible. And it was. 
Millions of dollars were squandered and some who used the company's tests, including a cancer patient, say they were misdiagnosed.
Now, years after Theranos collapsed, Holmes has been found guilty in California on four counts of conspiring to defraud investors.
For an outsider to Silicon Valley the story sounds nonsensical. How were so many people taken in?
Yet in Silicon Valley, many believe that Theranos - far from being an aberration - speaks of systemic problems with start-up culture.
In Silicon Valley, hyping up your product - over-promising - isn't unusual, and Holmes was clearly very good at it.
A Stanford University drop-out, she was, by all accounts articulate, confident and good at presenting a vision - a mission as she described it - to revolutionise diagnostics. 
Sceptical experts told her that her idea was just that - an idea - and wouldn't work.
But she projected an unfaltering confidence that the technology would change the world.
""It's baked in to the culture"" said Margaret O'Mara, author of The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.
 ""If you are a young start-up in development - with a barely existent product - a certain amount of swagger and hustle is expected and encouraged"" she said.  
Particularly at an early stage, when a start-up is in its infancy, investors are often looking at people and ideas rather than substantive technology anyway. General wisdom holds that the technology will come with the right concept - and the right people to make it work. 
Ms Holmes was brilliant at selling that dream, exercising a very Silicon Valley practice: 'fake it until you make it'. 
Her problem was she couldn't make it work. Her lawyers argued that Holmes was merely a businesswoman who failed, but was not a fraudster.
The problem in Silicon Valley is that the line between fraud and merely playing into the faking it culture is very thin.
""Theranos was an early warning of a cultural shift in Silicon Valley that has allowed promoters and scoundrels to prosper,"" said tech venture capitalist Roger McNamee, who is critical of big tech and did not invest in Theranos. 
He believes that a culture of secrets and lies in Silicon Valley, a culture that allowed Theranos' tech to go un-analysed, is ""absolutely endemic"". 
Ambition can be good. Promising a brighter future, and then trying to realise that vision, brought about computers and smartphones.
But for investors, trying to separate the charlatans from the revolutionaries is a constantly evolving challenge.
Last month, Silicon Valley phone app start-up HeadSpin's CEO and founder, Manish Lachwani, was arrested for allegedly defrauding investors. For people putting money on the line, there are great fortunes to be made and lost.
In Silicon Valley intellectual property is closely guarded. The 'coke' recipe, the secret sauce, is often the thing that gives a company value, and new technology firms are particularly sensitive to having their ideas copied or stolen. 
Secrecy is important for these companies to succeed - but that culture of secrecy can also be used as a smoke screen, particularly when even employees and investors don't understand or aren't given access to the technology itself.
This is what happened at Theranos. Journalists, investors, politicians, you name it, were all told the science was there. Yet when questions were asked they were told the technology was so secret that it could not be fully explained, analysed or tested. 
Walgreens, a major client of Theranos, became exasperated with the lack of information given by the company about how the system worked. 
There are many Silicon Valley companies I've reported on that will not fully explain how their tech actually works. They claim to have ""proprietary"" systems that cannot yet be revealed or peer-reviewed. 
The system is based on trust, yet it is fundamentally at odds with a culture of ""faking it"" and creates the perfect environment for Thernanos-type scandals, where claims that aren't true are left unchallenged. 
A system that places so much emphasis on secrecy needs lawyers, and lots of them. Companies don't want their employees running off with ideas. Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are endemic in the start-up world - and by no means confined to tech. 
But Silicon Valley's culture of secrecy makes it notably difficult for whistle-blowers. 
After the company's collapse, former Theranos employees spoke of intense pressure to withdraw negative public remarks or stay quiet altogether. The company hired aggressive, expensive and very active lawyers to protect Theranos's reputation.
This is not uncommon in Silicon Valley, says Cori Crider from Foxglove, a group that helps whistle-blowers come forward. 
""I spent more than a decade working in national security and I very often feel like Silicon Valley types play from the playbook of the CIA on this stuff"", she said.
""They have managed to scare people and make them think they don't have the right to raise legitimate issues.""
If founders and chief executives aren't being honest, employees need to feel comfortable raising the alarm. All too often they don't.
Amid the hype, it can be easy to forget that many investors looked at Theranos and passed - especially those with a knowledge of healthcare. 
Among those who were notable investors were people and groups without expertise in health, such as the media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
For these investors with capital, often their decision to put in a stake assumes that smaller early stage funders have done their homework on the tech. 
""They're kind of taking third party validation at its word,"" said Ms O'Mara. 
Once again, it's a system based on trust - later investors trusting that earlier ones know what they're doing. The problem here is, with so much money sloshing around, that is not a given.
In the end, Theranos got caught. As a health technology company doing real life diagnostics, results and regulators would eventually prove it real or fake. 
But with many Silicon Valley companies selling the supposedly new and the cutting edge in fields far less tightly regulated, scrutiny is more lax.
Today, the 'fake it until you make it' culture is still alive and well - as is the repressive culture of secrecy and the aggressive use of NDAs for employees.  It's a model that has its advantages - and helps churn out extremely valuable and sometimes innovative companies. 
But it also means the ingredients are still in place for another Theranos scandal.

114;Elon Musk: Tesla criticised after opening Xinjiang showroom;['2022-01-04T02:26:24.000Z'];['BBC News'];['xinjiang', 'elon musk', 'tesla', 'china', 'uighurs'];['xinjiang', 'taking', 'manufacturing', 'ill', 'place', 'teslas', 'scott', 'tesla', 'industry', 'opening', 'showroom', 'president', 'elon', 'criticised', 'paul', 'musk'];"
Electric car maker Tesla has been criticised in the US after opening a showroom in China's controversial Xinjiang region.
The company, headed by billionaire Elon Musk, opened the showroom in the city of Urumqi on New Year's Eve.
However, the move has been welcomed by some in China.
China has been accused of slavery and genocide against the Uyghur minority group in the resource-rich western region of the country.
Republican senator Marco Rubio, who sponsored a bill signed into law by President Joe Biden in December that requires firms to prove that goods imported from Xinjiang were not produced with forced labour, spoke out about Tesla's decision.
Mr Rubio tweeted: ""Nationless corporations are helping the Chinese Communist Party cover up genocide and slave labour in the region.""
Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance of American Manufacturing industry body, said: ""I'll be blunt: Any company doing business in Xinjiang is complicit in the cultural genocide taking place there. But Tesla's actions are especially despicable.""
Tesla did not immediately reply to a request for comment from the BBC.
However, the opening of the new Tesla showroom was widely welcomed by users of China's Twitter-like Weibo social media platform.
One user posted: ""Thank you for expanding in Xinjiang, happy new year!"". Another said: ""You see, Tesla supports the development and construction of Xinjiang, unlike some companies.""
Late last year, US microchip giant Intel apologised after a backlash over a letter it sent urging suppliers not to source products or labour from Xinjiang.
The company's letter sparked criticism in China, with calls for a boycott.
Intel was not the first company to come under pressure over aims to comply with sanctions related to Xinjiang while continuing to operate in China.
Retail giants Nike and H&M also faced a backlash last year after they expressed concern about the alleged use of Uyghur forced labour in cotton production.
The Xinjiang region of China is home to many of country's Muslim Uyghur population and there have been allegations of forced labour and possibly genocide.
In December 2020, the BBC published an investigation based on new research showing China was forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities, including Uyghurs, into manual labour in Xinjiang's cotton fields. 
Beijing has repeatedly denied the claims.

Some residents under quarantine in the Chinese city of Xi'an have resorted to bartering supplies in recent days, as worries of food shortages continue.
Posts on social media show residents swapping supplies and even tech gadgets in exchange for food.
About13 million have been confined to their homes since 23 December, and presently cannot leave to buy food.
In recent days many have taken to social media with numerous complaints.
Authorities have been providing free food to households, but some have said their supplies are running low or that they had yet to receive aid.
Videos and photos on social media site Weibo showed people exchanging cigarettes for cabbage, dishwashing liquid for apples, and sanitary pads for a small pile of vegetables.
One video showed a resident appearing to trade his Nintendo Switch console for a packet of instant noodles and two steamed buns. 
""People are swapping stuff with others in the same building, because they no longer have enough food to eat,"" a resident surnamed Wang told RFA news. The news outlet also reported that another man had wanted to trade a smartphone and tablet for rice.
""Helpless citizens have arrived at the era of bartering - potatoes are exchanged for cotton swabs,"" one Weibo user said, while another described it as a ""return to primitive society"". 
Some were more optimistic though, and commented on how ""touched"" they were by their neighbours' kindness of sharing their supplies with them. 
Xi'an is at the epicentre of China's current Covid outbreak, and authorities have enacted drastic measures. But local authorities' management of the lockdown has attracted significant criticism online.
In a recent incident, residents in the Mingde 8 Yingli housing compound in the south of the city were reportedly told just after midnight on 1 January that they had to leave their homes and go to quarantine facilities. 
The city's outbreak is the worst China has seen in months as it pursues its zero Covid strategy.
The government hopes to eliminate the outbreak before Lunar New Year and the Winter Olympics in Beijing next month.

116;Apple becomes first firm to hit $3tn market value;['2022-01-04T03:56:12.000Z'];['BBC News'];['stock markets', 'apple'];['market', 'tablets', 'soar', '3tn', 'apple', 'value', 'worlds', 'valuation', 'smartphones', 'hit', 'rise', 'saw', 'firm', 'technology', 'took', 'stock'];"
US technology giant Apple has become the first company to hit a stock market valuation of $3tn (£2.2tn).
The firm's share price has risen by around 5,800% since co-founder and former chief executive Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone in 2007.
However, its value slipped a little from that milestone, to end Monday's trading session in New York at $2.99tn.
Apple has been one of the big winners of the pandemic, as coronavirus lockdowns saw spending on gadgets jump.
""Hitting $3 trillion is another historical moment for Apple as the company continues to prove the doubters wrong,"" Dan Ives, an analyst from Wedbush said.
It took just over 16 months for Apple's stock market valuation to rise from $2tn to $3tn, as the world's biggest technology companies saw demand soar as people became more reliant on smartphones, tablets and laptops during lockdowns.
The company became the first company to hit a stock market valuation of $1tn in August 2018.
The iPhone typically accounts for around half of the company's sales, while it is also well-known for its iPad tablets and Mac computers.
Increasingly important parts of the business are software, sold through the Apple store, storage space via the iCloud and services such as its music, television and fitness subscription platforms.
""The linchpin to Apple's valuation re-rating remains its Services business which we believe is worth $1.5 trillion,"" Mr Ives said.
In August, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook received more than five million shares in the firm, as he marked ten years in the job.
A company filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed that he sold most of the shares for more than $750m.
It was part of a deal he struck when he took over from co-founder Steve Jobs.
The award was dependent upon on how well Apple's shares had performed compared to other firms on the S&P 500 stock index.
Cupertino, California-based Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and his business partners Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne.
The company made its stock market debut in 1980 with a market valuation of $1.8bn.
In November, the original Apple computer built by Mr Wozniak and Mr Jobs fetched $400,000 at auction in the US.

117;Why BlackBerry held the tiny keys to my heart;['2022-01-04T01:41:01.000Z'];['BBC News'];['blackberry', 'mobile phones'];['short', 'qwerty', 'plank', 'heart', 'stream', 'wood', 'blackberry', 'tiny', 'pressing', 'hard', 'keyboard', 'love', 'held', 'keys'];"
Many vintage BlackBerry phones will stop working on Tuesday as the company turns off support for its operating system. For journalist, Bill Wilson it means the retirement of a faithful work-horse. 
""Is that a Blackberry, I didn't know they were still going?"" has been many a conversation opener over the past decade, and particularly over the past five or six years.
From airport security to pubs and restaurants, even in hospital intensive care, strangers have looked on curiously and even asked to hold and look at my Q10 phone with its distinctive qwerty keyboard.
But my stock answer of ""yes they are still going"" would now have to add ""but not their classic phones"".
Launched in 2013, that particular model and BlackBerry's phones since then, have faced an increasingly impossible battle as Apple and Samsung set about their battle for global smartphone domination.
Hard to believe that in the late 2000s and early 2010s Blackberrys were a ubiquitous sight on commuter trains, trams and planes across the UK - as business professionals scrolled through their emails and tap-tapped away their replies.
But now, after reports of the demise of BlackBerry's operating system on many previous occasions, it really is the final curtain.
For on 4 January, the Canadian firm - which is now a specialist in cybersecurity software - is to turn off its BlackBerry OS support.
Announcing the termination, BlackBerry thanked ""our many loyal customers and partners over the years.""
It means remaining die-hard owners of their devices won't be able to make or receive calls, send texts, use wi-fi or access mobile data. 
That includes all smartphones running on BlackBerry 7.1 OS and earlier, the BlackBerry 10 operating system and the tablet-based BlackBerry PlayBook OS.
Phones such as my antique Q10 ‎will completely cease to function, though it may remain handy as a back-up for contact numbers.
The only glimmer of sustained life is that post-2016 Blackberry-branded phones, which were made under licence by Chinese firm TCL, will still work as they use the Android operating system.
Over the years it's not just Blackberry phone user numbers that have dwindled, but support and functions have dropped away one by one.
Support for many apps, including BBC iPlayer and Whatsapp, was withdrawn from BlackBerry OS devices and not long ago YouTube stopped working too.
Somehow or other I was able to circuitously get the latter two to work again, by downloading links from far corners of the planet.
Apps have become a non-existent element for users of BlackBerry devices.
For example, at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 I found myself unable to download the various NHS apps, and had to sign in to places manually.
So, why go to all this trouble?
In short, it is still great for emails, with five or six different addresses all in one stream. I also love the Qwerty keyboard with keys that depress and are not like pressing a hard plank of wood.
As phones have become progressively bigger, the BlackBerry still fits beautifully, and fairly lightly, in the hand.
It's a feeling that Ben Wood, an industry analyst for CCS Insight and founder of the Mobile Phone Museum, agrees with.
""The dedicated qwerty keyboard was an iconic design,"" he says. ""The devices became so comfortable in people's hands that they developed muscle memory delivering fast and accurate text input.""
Mr Wood says: ""It always makes me smile when I show kids some of the mobile phones of yesterday.
""They are enthralled by the design diversity. I even had a 14 year-old ask me the other day 'why don't they bring keyboards back?' which made me smile."" 
It is almost exactly 23 years since BlackBerry launched its 850 phone, and the company soon became the leader in providing emails when out and about on the move.
There was also the attraction of BBM - BlackBerry's Instant Messenger service - although this facility attracted unwanted publicity during the riots that swept through many UK cities in 2011.
There were outraged cries of protest that the police could not monitor the encrypted nature of BBM messages to find out where looters would strike next.
But the models that followed the iconic BlackBerry Bold would face increasing competition from Apple and Android phones.
So what happens next?
In 2020, TCL's licence ended and was picked up by a firm called Onward Mobility. It promised a 5G BlackBerry running Android for 2021, but nothing emerged. 
For now I shall try my luck with a second-hand Android Blackberry KeyOne - itself five years old now - (from Canadian Ebay this time), and bought long ago in preparation for just this such day.
And I shall also hold onto my useless Q10 - you never know when in the future someone may ask...""is that an antique BlackBerry?""

118;How my pregnancy led to a life-changing diagnosis;['2022-01-04T02:21:51.000Z'];['BBC News'];['pregnancy'];['ripples', 'waves', 'cochlea', 'noises', 'deep', 'hear', 'diagnosis', 'vibration', 'sea', 'lifechanging', 'bones', 'pregnancy', 'led', 'eardrum'];"
Three years ago, BBC radio broadcaster Helena Merriman received a shock diagnosis, which prompted her to explore how people handle uncertainty and adversity at a moment of profound change.
It's four in the morning and something's wrong. There's an empty space where my husband should be. A flicker on the baby monitor and there he is - holding Sam, our four-month-old baby. I'm confused - I always hear Sam first. Over the next few weeks, this happens again and again - I keep sleeping through Sam's cries at night. Then during the day, I notice I'm struggling to hear other things, too. I find myself staring at my friends' lips to work out what they're saying. 
After a referral from my GP, I go to an audiology clinic and following a series of tests, I'm told I've lost a lot of my hearing in my right ear. ""Don't worry, it's probably just congestion - the after-effects of a cold. If things aren't better in six weeks, come back,"" I'm told. 
Six weeks later, on a hot August day, I return to the clinic. I'm called into Room 5 - an airless, white room with bare walls. A consultant in a light blue shirt says that from my symptoms, he thinks I have something called otosclerosis. 'It's a degenerative hearing condition,' he says. Genetic. And there's no cure. 
That night, I lie in bed and consider the questions I didn't ask - how soon will I lose my hearing? Could I go deaf? If it's genetic, have I passed it on to my kids? I think back to when I was a child and my obsession with sound began. I recall the tapes I still have in a drawer - my granddad talking, my cat purring, an accordion festival, endless recordings of the sea. I remember learning the piano when I was little, the moment I could name the pitch of a note by hearing it and the world became an orchestra. I think of these sounds slipping away and I'm terrified. 
Otosclerosis is relatively common - around one to two percent of us have it. But it affects one group more than others - women who have recently had a baby. That's because of the effect of pregnancy hormones that fast-track the disease, and it explains why I noticed my hearing loss just after giving birth.
For the next few months, I ignore my diagnosis. I don't want to make it real by saying it out loud. And I can't bring myself to tell people at work, when my job as a broadcaster and documentary maker depends on my ability to hear. 
I read a lot about otosclerosis and discover why I'm struggling to hear. Imagine you're standing on a beach, watching the sea. The noises you can hear ripple through the air towards you - small ripples for high pitched noises like gulls, or large ripples for the deep rumbles of the sea. When those sound waves hit your eardrum, it vibrates and that vibration is sent behind your eardrum to three tiny bones - the malleus, the incus and the stapes, the smallest bone in your body. Those bones then send the vibration into your cochlea - a labyrinth of bones that sits deep in your ear. And this is the magical moment - when your cochlea turns the mechanical waves into electrical waves that your brain can process - and you hear. 
If you have otosclerosis, when the vibrations reach your stapes, it doesn't vibrate. That's because otosclerosis is a disease that affects the bone that surrounds the stapes. 
Although there's no cure, I discover there's an operation that could restore my hearing. But there are risks - in rare cases the operation could leave your face paralysed, you could become permanently dizzy, or you could go deaf in your operated ear. 
I wrestle with the decision - I'm in the middle of making a podcast series, Tunnel 29, about an escape under the Berlin Wall. The thought of losing my hearing in one ear feels too much of a risk and I decide against the operation. 
The next few months are hard. I try an NHS hearing aid but I find it hard to differentiate between background sounds and speech. Then, after another test shows I've lost even more hearing in my right ear, I decide to go ahead. 
It's a cold March morning, and I'm lying in an operating theatre at the Royal Ear Nose and Throat Hospital. Jeremy Lavy - the ear surgeon doing my operation - has somehow got to get to my stapes, deep inside my head. He folds my eardrum forward, picks up a tiny laser, points it at my stapes, and this is the crucial moment. If his hand moves a millimetre, my face could be paralysed, or I could lose all the hearing in my ear.
He fires the laser. My stapes comes loose, then he takes a tiny prosthetic stapes, pushes it through my ear canal and hooks it on to the bone. Suddenly, I can hear out of my right ear - music, the gentle sound of talking, the metallic clink of surgical instruments on trays. It feels like a mini-miracle.
Then two hours later, when I'm resting in a ward, a noise suddenly appears in my right ear - it sounds like a kettle whistling and it's incredibly loud. A nurse reminds me that you can have strange noises after the operation, but that night, the noise continues - this strange new sound that's nothing like the more-typical high-pitched tinnitus I've had for years. 
At my two-week check-up, Jeremy Lavy explains that in 90% of cases, the operation reduces or takes away tinnitus. But for 10% of people, their tinnitus doesn't improve - or it might get worse. They don't know why. 
The loud kettle-whistling continues and it's hard to think about anything else. I crave noise. The London underground becomes my favourite place as the roar of the tube drowns out the whistling. One evening I'm at home with the kids. We're looking at a picture book and my daughter Matilda is helping Sam with his first words. As he babbles ""cat"" and ""duck"", I wish I could hear him without the whistling. That night I find a tinnitus forum online. I post a message, and people reply with advice - stop drinking alcohol, get more sleep, do more exercise, don't go anywhere noisy. Over the next few weeks, I do everything they suggest - which means I rarely go out. It helps - some nights the whistling feels quieter, but I feel isolated. 
This might sound familiar. Around one in eight of us live with constant tinnitus. It could be ringing, whooshing, buzzing, or humming and then there's pulsatile tinnitus, which beats in time with your pulse. In tinnitus forums, there's one piece of advice everyone gives: Don't think about the tinnitus. I try. But it's like when someone says, ""Don't think about a monkey"" - and there it is, you're thinking about a monkey. 
As I try to find a way of living with this new noise, I begin to tell more people about my diagnosis. And after I've told them about the broken bit of my body, invariably they tell me about the broken bit of them. 
The conversations are extraordinary. I hear about decades-long searches for diagnosis, conditions I never knew existed, treatments I never thought possible. But the bit I'm most interested in is the recovery - after diagnosis and treatment, how do you put yourself back together? I start thinking about how little we share of these moments. Yes, we might tell friends in the pub about an illness or operation, but we often skate over things. It's hard to convey the visceral details - the sound of a auditory hallucination, the prickling fear when you're sat in a room about to be given a diagnosis, the dizzying relief when you find a way of coping with something you thought you couldn't live with.
And that's where the idea for my new podcast series - Room 5 - comes from. 
So I start recording interviews: Bex (a university student) tells me about her anxiety and hallucinations that led to a revelatory diagnosis; Jon - a businessman - tells me about the itching in his penis that began at Peppa Pig World; Serena tells me about a unfathomable decision she had to make after a diagnosis, Gavandra tells me how she came to terms with a childhood trauma, and Joel tells me about his rare condition that's advanced our understanding of empathy.
It's been two years since my ear operation. There were times I regretted it, when I thought I'd never learn to live with the loud kettle-whistling noise. But like many people who live with constant tinnitus, I've found ways of coping. Now, I have no regrets. Instead, I feel lucky to live in a time when a brilliant surgeon can give me back my hearing. 
The operation may not have given me an uncomplicated fix, but often that's how it goes. You go into a room, you're diagnosed with a condition, you're given treatment and nearly always, there's something unexpected, and you're forever changed. There are professionals who support you through recovery - doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists - but eventually, you're left with yourself and you have to find the answers that don't exist in medical textbooks. 
Many of us, one day, will sit in a room and be given a diagnosis. For me, it was Room 5. For you, it will likely have been a room with a different number. Or maybe it hasn't happened yet. But if - when - it does, I hope the stories in Room 5 help shepherd you through whatever comes.
Room 5 will be broadcast every Tuesday at 09:00 on Radio 4 and is available on-demand only on BBC Sounds from Tuesday 11 January.

119;Is there a better way to make new resolutions stick?;['2022-01-04T00:03:53.000Z'];['By Padraig Belton'];['apps', 'fitness', 'life', 'lifestyle'];['thing', 'way', 'better', 'shubhangi', 'resolutions', 'look', 'stick', 'journal', 'isnt', 'psychiatry', 'karmakar', 'junior', 'form', 'tell'];"
""Run. Work on doctorate."" So begin all my to-do lists but progress is elusive. With New Year's resolution season here - perhaps technology can make me into a more productive machine.
""An extraordinary amount of what we do is habit,"" says Brendan Kelly, professor of psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin.
It is estimated that between 45% and 95% of what we do is habitual, ""but I'd reckon towards the higher end of that range,"" says Prof Kelly.
We act according to our habits, ""from the time we rise and go through our morning routines, until we fall asleep after evening routines,"" says Ann Graybiel, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
We develop those habits by encoding them in a part of our brain called the striatum, which deals with reward and releases the ""feel-good"" neurotransmitter dopamine, her research shows.
Now a new cohort of apps - with names like SnapHabit, Habitica and Strides - reckon we can reprogram our habits to improve our lives and be happier.
SnapHabit, for instance, arrives with two default habits: to take a daily walk, and ring a friend.
At the bottom appear ""guided journeys"", or sample practices you can select to exercise in the habit app gym. For example, becoming a more committed opponent of racism is one, doing 100 press-ups a day is another.
Or, you can choose your own. I add ""Run for an hour"", and ""Colour two boxes"" on the days I selected. It is strangely satisfying.
Short-term rewards like this are important for changing our habits, says Prof Kelly. Doing physical exercise just to be healthier ""is not enough to sustain a daily habit"", he warns. 
And to get a new habit or change an old one, the change ""needs to be small, should ideally be tied to an existing habit, and must be rewarding in the short term,"" Prof Kelly adds.
So, apps can help contribute toward short-term rewards. And also tie our new habits to existing ones. Like checking our mobiles, or sharing things we've done with our friends.
Telling people in our lives about our attempts to change a habit can also make us work harder - because we then have friends to hold us accountable.
""We did a correlation analysis. How many friends you had on the app was correlated with how successful you were in changing your habits,"" says Jake Bernstein, SnapHabit's co-founder.
Similarly, Habitica, another app, includes ""a quest function that incorporates social accountability,"" says Vicky Hsu, who was an early user of the app and then became chief executive of the company behind it.
More technology of business:
""If you don't do any of the things that you've committed to for the day, then the app takes away points from you and from everyone else who's opted in to participating in the quest with you,"" explains Ms Hsu.
And collecting ""random pets"" as part of the game helped her stay on top of meditating, exercising, and going to bed on time, she says.
""I found the visual representation of the work I was doing extremely helpful, especially since I do a lot of intangible work that doesn't necessarily feel productive,"" says Ms Hsu, who also practises as a lawyer.
On SnapHabit, the largest group, 32.7% of users, is trying to exercise more. In second place, 15.9% are trying to build habits to learn or study.
Mr Bernstein says he was surprised by some of the habits people set up -  for example, ""not masturbating"".
If an app successfully helps us change our habits, it's likely because it mirrors behavioural principles for how we can best train the basal ganglia in the striatum in our brain.
One aspect is cognitive load: this is the mental effort involved in completing a task or learning new information.
We're more likely to learn a new habit when this is low, so by marking tasks we've completed, an app can reduce it, and make forming the habit easier for us.
Another is called the ""Zeigarnik effect"": we remember incomplete tasks more than ones we've completed.
So, by showing progress bars or percentages, an app can help remind us of our tasks in progress.
Talking about the origin of his own app, ""I originally built it to solve my own problem,"" says Mr Bernstein.
""I know the things that I enjoy doing and that give me fulfilment, so how can I map the way I spend my time to those things.""
He had begun quantifying his time with a Fitbit, but when Covid started he wanted to make it ""more social, make us more connected and help us meet our goals together"".
It's a similar story to Kyle Richey's, founder of the Strides habit app. ""In 2011, I was using to-do list and calendar apps to manage my day,"" he says.
These were ""awesome replacements for their analogue counterparts, but I felt like something was missing,"" he observes.
""I wanted to do more than put an ""!"" on a task. I needed a way to prioritise the right things and use behavioural science techniques to stay motivated and focused.""
Apps that show you the number of consecutive days you've followed a new habit represent ""a super powerful tactic but can also be incredibly frustrating if you drop them"", says Mr Bernstein. 
It's important ""to be compassionate to yourself when you fail,"" he says. And take away something positive, like insight about what motivates you.
An app ""will never tell you to take a break and look after yourself,"" says Shubhangi Karmakar, a junior doctor in Dublin and an editor of the British Journal of Psychiatry. ""The important thing isn't just to form a habit, but to form a healthy one,"" she says.
Changing our behaviour is ""the hardest thing"", adds Mr Bernstein. And ultimately, apps like these on their own can only go so far.
After all, for me, the consecutive number of days spent working on my doctorate still remains stubbornly stuck at zero.

120;Silicon Valley's trial of the century;['2022-01-04T11:19:43.000Z'];['By James Clayton'];['theranos trial', 'silicon valley', 'fraud', 'medical technology'];['thing', 'trial', 'used', 'sticks', 'smoking', 'plank', 'pfizer', 'century', 'theranos', 'suggest', 'silicon', 'pharmaceutical', 'prosecution', 'valleys'];"
It was a verdict that reflected the often painful complexities and contradictions of blood testing company Theranos. 
Four guilty verdicts, four acquittals and three charges on which the jury couldn't agree. 
For many who have followed the Theranos saga, the podcasts, the documentaries, the books, you might have thought that Elizabeth Holmes's conviction was nailed down. 
After all, she had claimed her diagnostics machines could test hundreds of diseases, when they couldn't. And she was the founder and chief executive of Theranos, so surely the buck would stop with her in court?
But underestimate Holmes at your peril. This is a woman who created a $9bn (£6.6bn) company she set up when she was 19. A woman who at one point had the world at her feet - who Bill Clinton and Joe Biden both praised. 
This video can not be played
There was another reason to think Holmes might be acquitted. These fraud cases are extremely difficult to prosecute. Jurors were asked to consider hundreds of technical documents and sit through evidence from dozens of witnesses. 
Holmes has just had a baby too, and some commentators believed she would strike a sympathetic character. 
Holmes also personally gave evidence in court, an unusual thing to do in a fraud trial. She described a relationship she had with Theranos's chief operating officer, Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, who she claimed exercised coercive control over her. She also said she had been sexually abused. Mr Balwani categorically denies the allegations. 
Some onlookers have remarked that this part of Holmes's evidence was particularly effective. The jury was listening.
Holmes's defence also believe they had one killer argument - that Holmes never sold her shares. Even when the company was worth nearly $10bn (and Holmes nearly $5bn) all wrapped up in shares, she didn't cash out. Those shares are now worthless. 
Her defence argued that if she was a genuine fraud she would have taken the money and run. Instead, they said, she believed in what she was doing. 
Yet both things can be true. You can have a vision, a goal, a mission as Holmes would call it, and still commit fraud. 
At times Holmes was shown evidence that she herself admitted didn't look good. She said on more than one occasion that there were things she would have done differently in hindsight. 
One particular example that sticks out is when the logos of Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline were used to suggest the two pharmaceutical companies had endorsed Theranos. They had done no such thing. The prosecution made this a major plank of their argument - as close as they could get to a smoking gun.           
Holmes's defence also had a major hole in it. Almost everyone you speak to about Theranos says that Holmes ran the company like an obsessive autocrat. She knew everything about what was going on. 
Yet part of her defence was that she didn't know what was happening in her company - or the major problems with the tech. All too often she said she wasn't aware of information put to her by the prosecution, or that she didn't remember key events. It didn't ring true. 
Holmes always wanted to be in control. And some have speculated that's why she decided to testify, to be in the driving seat of her own defence. It didn't work. 
Silicon Valley is full of crooks, frauds and charlatans. ""Fake it until you make it"" is the brash term often used. Holmes certainly talked a good game. Yet the confidence, the certainty of success she conveyed was bluster. 
However, some have noted it's telling that one of the very few high-profile female tech chief executives has been found guilty of fraud - when other high-profile (men) have not.
The verdict will, in theory, make founders sit up and take note - that there are consequences to not telling investors the truth. 
But others wonder whether it will change anything much. In Silicon Valley there are still major rewards for selling dreams - for telling investors what they want to hear - rather than the truth.

121;Donald Trump's children refuse to testify in fraud inquiry;['2022-01-04T11:42:53.000Z'];['BBC News'];['donald trump jr', 'ivanka trump', 'donald trump', 'us politics', 'united states'];['testify', 'children', 'refuse', 'truth', 'uncovered', 'spokesperson', 'jamess', 'inquiry', 'fraud', 'answered', 'trumps', 'law', 'donald', 'questions', 'confident', 'ms'];"
Two of Donald Trump's children have refused to testify to a fraud inquiry into the family's business.
Donald Jr, 44, and Ivanka, 40, were ordered to give evidence by New York Attorney General Letitia James.
She opened a civil inquiry in 2019 into claims that - before he took office - Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans.
Mr Trump's lawyers are trying to stop Ms James from questioning the former US president and his children.
They have asked a judge to quash the ""unprecedented and unconstitutional"" bid for their testimony.
Mr Trump sued Ms James last month, accusing the attorney general - an elected Democrat - of pursuing a politically motivated witch hunt against him, a Republican.
She had requested he testify in person at her office before Friday.
The court filing on Monday is the first time investigators have said they want to question Donald Jnr and Ivanka under oath.
Ms James's spokesperson said: ""We are confident that our questions will be answered and the truth will be uncovered because no one is above the law.""
Another son, Eric, 37, who is executive vice-president at the Trump Organization, was questioned in October 2020.
Ms James's civil case is separate to an ongoing criminal investigation in Manhattan into the organisation's business practices.
Donald Jr and Eric took over control of the company along with Allen Weisselberg, chief financial officer, when their father took office in January 2017. 
Ivanka also worked at the Trump Organization, before becoming a senior White House adviser.
Mr Weisselberg pleaded not guilty in July to tax fraud charges.

122;Top US phone firms agree delay of 5G rollout;['2022-01-04T04:00:43.000Z'];['BBC News'];['at&t', 'aviation safety', 'telecommunication', '5g', 'air travel'];['firms', 'technical', 'statement', 'delay', 'safety', 'mr', 'know', 'rollout', 'spokeswoman', 'phone', 'issues', '5g', 'agree', 'collaboration', 'confident', 'request'];"
Two of the biggest US phone firms have agreed a government request to delay the rollout of 5G services this week.
The US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) made the request over concerns about aviation safety.
Plane makers have warned that C-Band spectrum 5G wireless signals may interfere with sensitive aircraft electronics and could disrupt flights.
AT&T and Verizon initially rejected the delay request, before reversing.
Chief executives had pushed back against a second delay request on Sunday, having already put plans on hold since late last year.
They had also offered to mitigate service around US airports for six months as a temporary safeguard, along a similar approach adopted in France. 
The aviation industry and the FAA has raised concerns about potential interference of 5G with aircraft equipment like radio altitude meters.
Last month, the bosses of the world's two biggest plane makers, Airbus and Boeing, made an appeal to Mr Buttigieg in which they said ""5G interference could adversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate"". 
The letter cited research by trade group Airlines for America which found that if the FAA's 5G rules had been in effect in 2019, about 345,000 passenger flights and 5,400 cargo flights would have faced delays, diversions or cancellations.
The phone companies both announced they had accepted the proposed two-week delay late on Monday.  
An AT&T spokeswoman said they had agreed to the request from Mr Buttigieg, but said in a statement that ""we know aviation safety and 5G can co-exist and we are confident further collaboration and technical assessment will allay any issues"".
The FAA thanked for firms for the voluntary delay in a statement. 
""We look forward to using the additional time and space to reduce flight disruptions associated with this 5G deployment,"" they added.

123;Nirvana's Nevermind cover art lawsuit dismissed;['2022-01-04T11:09:04.000Z'];['By Mark Savage'];['music'];['lawsuit', 'dismissed', 'selfparodying', 'used', 'cover', 'album', 'title', 'talk', 'nirvanas', 'art', 'try', 'tattooed', 'wearing', 'women', 'times', 'nevermind'];"
A judge in California has dismissed a lawsuit against Nirvana made by Spencer Elden, who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of their album Nevermind.
Elden sued the band last year, alleging sexual exploitation, and that the artwork constituted child sexual abuse.
Now 30, he said the infamous image had caused him ""extreme and permanent emotional distress"" as well as loss of wages and ""enjoyment of life"".
Nirvana filed to dismiss last month, saying Elden's arguments lacked merit.
""Elden's claim that the photograph on the Nevermind album cover is 'child pornography' is, on its face, not serious,"" their lawyers said, noting that anyone who owned a copy of the record would ""on Elden's theory [be] guilty of felony possession of child pornography"". 
They continued by noting that, until recently, Elden had seemed to enjoy the notoriety of being the ""Nirvana baby"".
""He has re-enacted the photograph in exchange for a fee, many times; he has had the album title... tattooed across his chest; he has appeared on a talk show wearing a self-parodying, nude-colored onesie; he has autographed copies of the album cover for sale on eBay; and he has used the connection to try to pick up women.""
The motion was filed by lawyers representing surviving Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic; Kurt Cobain's widow Courtney Love; and Kirk Weddle, the photographer of the cover image.
Regardless of the merits of Elden's case, they argued, the statute of limitations on his claims had expired in 2011, meaning he was too late to sue.
His lawyers have argued that the statute of limitations does not apply, as long as Nevermind continues to be sold in its current form.
""Child pornography is a forever crime,"" Marsh Law told Variety in a statement last year. ""Any distribution of or profits earned from any sexually explicit image of a child not only creates longstanding liability but it also breeds lifelong trauma. This is common for all of our clients who are victims of actively traded child pornography, regardless of how long ago the image was created.""
Elden's team had until 30 December to respond to Nirvana's motion to dismiss, but missed the deadline.
As a result, Judge Fernando M Olguin dismissed the case ""with leave to amend"" - meaning his team have until 13 January to refile the case with appropriate changes.

124;South Africa parliament fire: Suspect 'had explosives';['2022-01-04T12:17:26.000Z'];['BBC News'];['south africa', 'cape town'];['date', 'suspect', 'upper', 'masondo', 'damaged', 'parliamentary', 'south', 'explosives', 'chamber', 'sundays', 'national', 'parts', 'parliament', 'led', 'africa'];"
A man detained for setting South Africa's parliament in Cape Town on fire was found at the site with explosives, prosecutors have alleged. 
Zandile Christmas Mafe, 49, appeared in a city court on charges under the Explosives Act, as well as for arson, theft and a break-in.
His lawyer said he was innocent of all the charges. 
The fire first broke out on Sunday, totally destroying the National Assembly, or lower chamber. 
No-one was injured the blaze, but it has left the nation shocked. 
Mr Mafe is the only person arrested in connection with the fire. 
He looked unkempt and dazed in court, reports the BBC's Nomsa Maseko from Cape Town. 
As he arrived in the dock wearing shorts and a creased shirt, he removed his face mask and did a 360-degree turn as cameras flashed.  
Police said Mr Mafe had been arrested within the parliamentary complex after the fire started, but his lawyer said the wrong person had been detained. 
The case was postponed for seven days to allow police to continue with their investigations. 
Firefighters say they have managed to contain the blaze that reignited on Monday.
Strong winds caused smouldering wood in the roof to catch fire again.
A video of Monday's blaze has been posted on parliament's Twitter account:
On Sunday, President Cyril Ramaphosa - who admitted the building's sprinkler system had not functioned properly - praised firefighters for responding to the ""terrible and devastating event"" in minutes.
Government minister Patricia de Lille separately admitted that CCTV cameras had not been monitored at the time the initial fire started. 
The chairperson of the upper chamber, Amos Masondo, said Sunday's fire had led to the ""complete burning down"" of the National Assembly chamber. Other areas of the parliamentary complex - parts of which date back to 1884 - were also badly damaged.
The parliament is not currently in session because of the holidays, and no-one was injured.
The building is home to thousands of treasures including historic books, photographs and important works of art, which officials said had been saved.
There had been particular concern that the valuable Keiskamma Tapestry, which is 120m (394ft) long, and documents South Africa's history, may have been damaged or destroyed.
It is expected to be many months before the building can be used again.
Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said the city's council chamber would be made available as an alternative place for parliament to meet.

125;Pushpa: Why a song calling out men is under fire for sleaze;['2022-01-04T02:58:06.000Z'];['By Sharanya Hrishikesh'];['asia', 'india'];['pushpa', 'calling', 'stars', 'southern', 'ruth', 'sleaze', 'songs', 'titillating', 'appear', 'samantha', 'viewers', 'song', 'men'];"
A scantily-clad woman gyrating to a racy song has powered some of India's biggest chartbusters.
So, when a new song from the southern Telugu film industry dropped in December, claiming to subvert the male gaze, it grabbed attention. 
It was recorded in five languages - Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam and Hindi - and released along with just 19 seconds of footage. The lyrics had the same message across the versions: whether a woman is old or young, tall or short, wearing a sari or a gown, she cannot escape ogling male eyes. 
But many women were not impressed. They saw it as a mere gimmick, and a deeply offensive one at that, claiming to break down the very thing it's built upon: the male gaze.
The song's lyrics, in fact, imply women are irresistible sirens, and men are uncontrollable lechers, argue some critics. 
And, they say, it has all the elements of what is now a familiar formula: men leering at a woman as she sways, slides and drapes herself over the hero, while a camera constantly cuts to bared bits of her body.
All of this ""left little doubt that the video would celebrate all that the words appeared to lament,"" wrote one reviewer. 
""I examined the different lyrics. There is a line across all the versions which compares women with food,"" says Sowmya Rajendran, features editor at The News Minute, where she writes about films.
""In Tamil, it's a dessert, in Telugu, grapes, in Malayalam, sugar. Treating women as consumables ends up justifying the ogling and lechery.""
Viewers, many of them male, love the song. They have lauded Samantha Ruth Prabhu, the song's protagonist and currently one of the biggest southern female stars, for her performance -  since she doesn't appear in the film, Pushpa, beyond the song, they appear elated that a heroine, who has so far been praised for her acting, can also be so titillating. 
The full video is yet to drop, even though the movie is out - but the track has now crossed 100 million views on YouTube in Telugu alone. And its title - oo antava - has been trending for days. 
Unsurprising, given that the so-called ""item"" song - in Indian male slang, an ""item"" is a sexy woman - has always been an unabashedly sexist and successful formula. 
Most ""item"" songs treat women like a piece of meat, both visually and in terms of the lyrics, says Ms Rajendran. 
She cites one of the worst offenders, the infamous 'Fevicol song', featuring Bollywood star Kareena Kapoor Khan, where she mouths lines likening herself to ""tandoori chicken that can be washed down with alcohol"". 
""In many cases, we know nothing about the woman in the song. She has no backstory, she just appears and then disappears from the movie,"" Ms Rajendran adds. 
""Item"" songs have long drawn outrage for objectifying women - with tight, revealing clothes, suggestive choreography, raunchy lyrics and voyeuristic camera angles. But they are undeniably popular in a country where the audience is overwhelmingly male. 
A popular soundtrack was once essential to a movie's fortunes, drawing people to the cinema and earning huge revenues for music labels. Now, in the age of YouTube and Instagram, songs are even more lucrative. 
In 1994, journalist Arun Katiyar wrote that the success of a scandalous film song the previous year helped create ""what the formula-crazed film world calls an 'item'"" as people raced to write ""obscene lyrics"".
The song was choli ke peeche kya hai, which translates to, what's behind your blouse? The innocent answer follows: my heart. But gesturing towards her chest, Madhuri Dixit, a top Bollywood star at the time, indicates there could be a more literal answer.
The risque words and suggestive moves outraged people, including politicians, who argued that it encouraged men to molest women. But the song became a wild hit. 
Over time, the clothes got tighter and shorter, and necklines plunged lower - even if the lyrics didn't objectify the woman, the camera did. Soon, ""item"" songs became glossy spectacles with ""special appearances"" by top Bollywood stars, from Aishwarya Rai to Katrina Kaif and Deepika Padukone. 
""The bigger the heroine in the track, the larger the chances of success of the song since there is no fantasy like watching the ultimate lead actress do a sensuous number,"" Vinod Bhanushali, then a top executive at India's biggest music label T-Series, told The Indian Express in 2010.
And the item song became ""cool"" - it was blared in nightclubs and inspired legions of wedding dances. 
""Your approach to the issue determines the way you tell your story and position your camera,"" says Avinash Das, whose 2017 film Anarkali of Aarah is about a singer-dancer in Bihar state. 
Anarkali, played by Swara Bhasker, mouths double entendres and dances with abandon, but the film never treats her like an object. The camera avoids close-ups of her body, often focusing on her from a distance to include other performers and the lascivious male gazes around her.
In a deeply satisfying subversion of a typical ""item"" song, Anarkali performs a ""revenge"" number at the end as she calls out the powerful man who had earlier molested her on stage.
Although it wasn't a commercial success, critics praised the film for putting the woman in control of her sexuality. 
Item songs, they argue, do the opposite. ""When you see fragmented bits of a woman's body - heaving bosom, swinging navel, shaking hip - you are robbing her of autonomy,"" actor Shabana Azmi said in 2018, adding that most times, the women who appeared in them were ""surrendering to the male gaze"". 
The women would disagree. Malaika Arora has said she ""never felt objectified"" in such songs. Katrina Kaif said she had ""enjoyed"" doing a 2012 hit after producer-director Karan Johar reiterated an earlier apology for including ""item"" songs in his films. 
While ""item"" songs are sometimes defended for celebrating female sexuality, Ms Rajendran points out that movies that actually do so often land in trouble. 
A good way to test these claims, she adds, is to measure the song's effect on viewers.
""Is the song making people uncomfortable by forcing them to confront their biases? Or is it conforming to them?""

126;Omicron stats are huge, but look beyond them;['2022-01-04T03:28:53.000Z'];['Nick Triggle'];['nhs', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['ae', 'patients', 'omicron', 'look', 'trusts', 'wales', 'nhs', 'shown', 'bed', 'data', 'england', 'huge', 'stats', 'hospital'];"
Covid infections have risen to unprecedented levels in recent weeks because of the Omicron variant.
But, as early evidence suggested it would, this variant is causing milder illness, for now at least.
A fall in the proportion of detected cases ending in hospital, shows this. It is now five times lower than it was a year ago.
This is largely thanks to a huge amount of immunity that has built up across the population either through vaccination or infection.
And with better treatments for those who do become ill, one way or another everyone is less at risk to some degree than they were previously.
But the sheer weight of infections means while Omicron is milder, patient numbers in hospital have been going up.
The total has doubled in just under a fortnight in England to more than 14,000. That, however, is still well under the 34,000 peak last winter when more than a third of beds were occupied by Covid patients. Rises are being seen elsewhere in the UK, although gaps in publishing data over the festive period make it hard to judge how quickly.
But to fully understand what's happening you need to look beyond the headline figures.
A hospital case this winter is not the same as one from earlier in the pandemic.
For one thing, a growing proportion of hospital patients with Covid are being treated for something else. They just happen to have the virus.
Latest data, from last week, suggested a third of those admitted to hospital in England were in this position. That's up from a quarter in the autumn. This data is not published in the UK's other nations but there is no reason to think it is any different.
Yet, as the chart above shows, the absolute number in hospital with Covid, and therefore severely ill, is still climbing. And even those who are not in primarily for Covid add pressure to the NHS because of the need for extra infection control measures.
Another sign of how Covid has changed is that the patients who are being treated for it are not getting as sick. 
There have been early reports that patients are not spending as long in hospital and the numbers needing critical care has hardly changed. All this puts the NHS in a stronger position to cope.
But make no mistake, the pressures on the front line are severe.
The number of people coming to hospital ill with Covid is well above what the NHS would normally get for all types of respiratory infections combined - and the numbers are rising.
How high they will go is still uncertain. Much depends on whether there will be a big wave of older, frail patients being admitted if Omicron infections move from younger people into older age groups.
There is growing confidence this may not happen though as hospital bosses are reporting even the outbreaks in care homes are not translating into the hospital admissions you would expect. What's more, London as a whole may have already peaked. The boosters, it seems, are holding up.

But the situation is further complicated by the high number of staff absences driven by large numbers having to isolate. 
Again England has the most comprehensive data. Pre-pandemic NHS staff absence in winter was around 5%. The latest data shows it was 8% in the week up to Christmas. 
The combined pressures have led at least half a dozen NHS trusts to declare major incidents - when demand exceeds capacity - in the past week. 
All this begs the question why something more is not being done to suppress the wave in England - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have tougher restrictions in place.
The problem now - illustrated by modelling produced for the government by Warwick University - is the window may already have passed. The research suggests even a return to lockdown with only schools open would have virtually no effect on hospitalisations if introduced today.
To have had a significant impact measures would need to have been introduced by Boxing Day or earlier, before Omicron had spread so much. 
Even then the argument in favour of tougher action was unclear as infections and hospitalisations would rebound once restrictions were lifted. Largely all it would have achieved is delaying and spreading out illness.
That may have helped the NHS, but would have had to be balanced against wider costs of restrictions to society, the economy and mental health from another lockdown.
What does seem likely is the wave will come and go pretty quickly - even in other parts of the UK the restrictions in place are expected to only have a limited impact.
And once it does, experts believe the extra immunity acquired will mean the population will be even better protected for the future.

127;Covid: US reports record 1m cases with peak still to come;['2022-01-04T12:27:05.000Z'];['BBC News'];['united states', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['cases', 'delta', 'surge', 'record', 'confirmed', 'came', 'reports', 'having', 'indias', 'outside', 'highest', 'disease', 'peak', '1m', 'covid', 'number', 'come'];"
The US has recorded more than one million new Covid cases, as officials warn the peak of a fast-spreading Omicron surge is still to come.
A record 1,080,211 cases were reported on Monday - the highest one-day tally of new cases anywhere in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University.
The Omicron variant accounts for the majority of cases in the US.
The top US pandemic adviser Anthony Fauci has said the country is facing ""almost a vertical increase"" in cases.
He said the peak may be weeks away.
But Dr Fauci said the example of South Africa - where Omicron first spread rapidly before subsiding - offered some hope.
Rates of death and hospital admissions in the US have been far lower in recent weeks than in previous infection spikes.
Some 8,652 people are reported to have died from the disease in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins.
The previous US record of cases was 590,000, reported four days ago.
The highest number outside the US came during India's Delta surge, when more than 414,188 people were confirmed as having the disease in May 2021.
Studies suggest that Omicron is milder than the previously dominant Delta variant, but fears remain that the sheer number of cases stemming from the highly infectious Omicron could overwhelm hospitals.

128;Two arrested in Egypt after teenage girl's suicide sparks outrage;['2022-01-04T15:15:47.000Z'];['BBC News'];['social media', 'egypt', 'women', 'sexual harassment'];['security', 'response', 'ministry', 'arrested', 'suspects', 'teenage', 'sparks', 'reports', 'public', 'suicide', 'social', 'outrage', 'egypt', 'prosecutors', 'media', 'investigation', 'girls'];"
Two people have been arrested in Egypt after a teenage girl who was allegedly being blackmailed with digitally altered images killed herself.
The sister of Basant Khaled, 17, told the Youm7 news website that fake photos of her had been published when she refused to go on a date with a youth.
After they were seen by her fellow students, Basant became depressed and swallowed a poisonous pill, she said.
News of her death sparked outrage and demands for justice on social media. 
The Arabic hashtag ""Basant_Khaled's_right_must_be_returned"" was trending on Twitter.
Many users posted a picture of a letter that Basant reportedly wrote to her mother, in which she protested her innocence.
""Mum, I hope you understand that I am not this girl. These photos are fake, I swear to God,"" the letter said. 
""Mum, I'm a young girl and I don't deserve what is happening to me. I'm very depressed. I can't have anymore of this. I'm tired. I'm suffocating.""
Basant's sister said: ""We believed that she was innocent and tried to support her. But she wasn't able to endure people's comments.""
She added: ""We will not give up Basant's right. Whoever caused her death must be punished.""
Fake images were allegedly created using photographs of Basant stolen from her mobile phone after she clicked on a link sent by the youth she had refused to date, Youm7 quoted the family's lawyer as saying. 
The lawyer filed a complaint at a police station in the town of Kafr al-Zayat, in the northern province of Gharbia, that named the youth and one other person Basant accused of involvement before she died.
The interior ministry said Basant's father had not yet filed a complaint but that security forces had detained two suspects in response to news and social media reports and public prosecutors had begun an investigation into the allegations of blackmail.

130;James Webb Space Telescope: Sun shield is fully deployed;['2022-01-04T16:59:32.000Z'];['Jonathan Amos'];['astronomy', 'nasa', 'european space agency', 'the universe', 'james webb space telescope', 'hubble telescope', 'space exploration'];['swamp', 'space', 'fully', 'webb', 'webbs', 'shield', 'temperatures', 'universe', 'infrared', 'wavelength', 'trying', 'telescope', 'targets', 'james', 'deployed'];"
The new James Webb telescope has passed a major milestone in its quest to image the first stars to shine in the cosmos. 
Controllers on Tuesday completed the deployment of the space observatory's giant kite-shaped sun shield.
Only with this tennis court-sized barrier will Webb have the sensitivity to detect the signals coming from the most distant objects in the Universe.
Commissioning work will now concentrate on unpacking the telescope's mirrors, the largest of which is 6.5m wide.
This video can not be played
The deployment of the five-membrane sun shield is a triumph for the engineering teams at the US space agency (Nasa) and the American aerospace manufacturer Northrop Grumman.
There were many who doubted the wisdom of a design that included so many motors, gears, pulleys and cables. 
But years of testing on full-scale and sub-scale models paid dividends as controllers first separated the shield's different layers and then tensioned them.
The fifth and final membrane - which like the other four had the thickness of a human hair - was locked into place at 16:58 GMT.
It's worth noting that all the previous testing was done on Earth, under gravity conditions. This was the first time the shield had been unfurled in the unique ""Zero-G"" environment of space. ""The first time, and we nailed it,"" enthused Alphonso Stewart, Nasa's Webb deployment systems lead.
""There was a lot of joy, a lot of relief,"" added Hillary Stock, the sunshield deployments lead at Northrop.
James Webb was launched on 25 December on an Ariane rocket from French Guiana.
The telescope is regarded as the successor to the Hubble space observatory which is now 31 years old and nearing the end of its operational life.
Webb will do similar science to Hubble but with the next-generation technologies that allow it to see deeper into the cosmos and, therefore, further back in time.
The expectation is that it will even catch the light from the pioneer stars that were first to ignite shortly after the Big Bang more than 13.5 billion years ago.
Critical to the whole endeavour, however, will be Webb's sensitivity in the infrared. The light coming to the telescope from its targets at the edge of the observable Universe will arrive in this longer wavelength domain. And that means Webb must be cooled to fantastically cold temperatures or its own infrared glow will swamp the signals it's trying to detect. 
Hence the shield. The shade it casts will lower the environment around Webb's mirrors and instruments to below minus 230C.
The controllers, who are based at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, now have Webb's golden mirrors in their sights.
Like the sun shield, the telescope's two principal reflectors had to be folded to fit inside the nosecone of the Ariane.
The end of this week should see the 74cm-wide secondary mirror extended on 8m-long booms in front of the primary mirror. 
The main mirror has ""wings"" that were tucked back for launch but which must now be rotated through 90 degrees to make a full, 6.5m-wide surface. Assuming things continue to run like clockwork, this should happen over the weekend.
James Webb is a joint venture between the American, European and Canadian space agencies.

The prime minister has said that England will stick with its current Covid restrictions for the time being, because of pressure on the NHS.
The measures are due for review this week, but they are expected to be kept in place at least until 26 January.
The government is sticking to a set of rules known as Plan B. These include:
The education secretary has also announced that secondary school pupils will have to wear face coverings in class until 26 January at the earliest, and that they would all be tested before returning to school this week.
New rules were introduced after Christmas to be reviewed on 11 January. They place limits on the size of live public events:
Football matches have become effectively spectator-free, and non-professional indoor contact sports has been halted. Nightclubs are closed. Life events like weddings are not affected.
Pubs, bars and other hospitality venues are operating with table service only. One-metre (3ft) social distancing is advised in these settings, with no more than three households in each group.
Other restrictions include:

137;Omicron: Good news, bad news and what it all means;['2021-12-24T00:47:27.000Z'];['By James Gallagher'];['coronavirus vaccines', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['variant', 'omicron', 'bad', 'nhs', 'good', 'likely', 'means', 'protection', 'seriously', 'virus', 'uk', 'hospital'];"
The world is being hit by a tsunami of Omicron. Scientists, politicians and indeed all of us are grappling with what it means for our lives. 
Restrictions are tightening in parts of the UK and other European countries in order to tackle the new variant. 
There's a constant stream of new information - some worrying, some positive. So where do we stand?
It is easy to forget, but we are in a much brighter place than this time last year when many of us could not meet family on Christmas Day.
The ""Christmas bubble"" rules meant in parts of the country you could spend the day only with those you lived with. But there were limits on the size of gatherings across the UK. 
The rise of the Alpha variant in late 2020 led to lockdowns in November and a long one in the New Year as the vaccination programme was only just getting going. 
The rules currently in place or coming into force on Boxing Day in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are much gentler by comparison.
If you catch Omicron then you are less likely to become seriously ill than with previous variants. 
Studies from around the world are painting a consistent picture that Omicron is milder than the Delta variant, with a 30% to 70% lower chance of people infected ending up in hospital. 
Omicron can cause cold-level symptoms such as a sore throat, runny nose and a headache, but that does not mean it will be mild for everyone and some will still be seriously ill. 
Changes to the virus seem to have made it less dangerous, but most of the reduced severity is down to immunity as a result of vaccination and previous bouts of Covid. 
The worry is severity is only one half of the equation if you care about whether hospitals can cope. 
If Omicron is half as likely to land you in hospital, but twice as many people are infected then the two cancel out and you're back to square one. 
And Omicron's real talent is infecting people. It spreads faster than other variants and can bypass some of the immune protection from vaccines and prior infections. 
The UK has record levels of Covid with confirmed cases on Thursday reaching nearly 120,000 - and this is an underestimate of what is really going on as not everyone gets a test and people who catch it more than once aren't included in the figures.
Old age has always been the biggest risk-factor for becoming seriously ill with Covid. 
In the UK, most of the Omicron cases and people ending up in hospital are under the age of 40 so we do not know for sure what will happen when it reaches old and vulnerable populations. 
The ability of Omicron to partially evade immunity means there is the potential for more older people to be infected than during the Delta wave.
Two doses of a vaccine offer little protection against catching Omicron, which led to a massive expansion of the booster campaign.
Now more than 31 million people in the UK have enhanced their immune defences. 
However, protection against catching Omicron seems to wane after about 10 weeks. Protection against severe disease is likely to hold up much longer. 
New medicines should keep even more patients out of hospital.
They are being given to people who are at high risk from Covid, including cancer patients and people who have had an organ transplant.
Molnupiravir is an anti-viral drug that disrupts Omicron's ability to replicate inside our bodies and cuts hospital admission by 30%. Sotrovimab is an antibody therapy that sticks to the virus and cuts hospital visits by 79%.
Both suppress the virus which buys time for the immune system to react. 
A surge in Omicron could put more people in hospital at the same time as taking away the people needed to care for them. 
The sheer volume of people catching Omicron is also affecting doctors, nurses and the rest of the NHS workforce as they have to isolate too. 
Nearly 19,000 NHS staff were off with Covid on 19 December, which is 54% higher than the week before. 
Meanwhile, NHS Providers, which represents hospital and ambulance services in England, says the health service is facing its busiest Christmas period ever. And that overall, 94.5% of adult beds were occupied compared with 89% last year.
The question is whether everything in our favour - milder, antivirals, boosters - is enough to deal with a variant that spreads faster than anything we've seen before. 
Or will it take more restrictions to manage the Omicron wave?
The speed this is happening means we will know very quickly how this is going to shake down.

140;Stephen Port: How Met failings contributed to the deaths of three men;['2021-12-10T13:18:55.000Z'];['By Daniel De Simone'];['barking and dagenham london borough council', 'metropolitan police service'];['contributed', 'met', 'port', 'flat', 'used', 'failings', 'unwell', 'returned', 'phone', 'young', 'raped', 'deaths', 'men', 'seen', 'told', 'stephen'];"
Inquests for the four victims of Stephen Port have exposed how failings by the Metropolitan Police contributed to the deaths of three men. 
Port killed four gay men - Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth and Jack Taylor  - between June 2014 and September 2015. For the first time, during the inquests, the Met Police responses to the deaths were fully revealed.
Here is the story of what happened.
Anthony Walgate from Hull was studying fashion in London and occasionally worked as an escort. Using an alias, Stephen Port arranged for him to visit his Barking flat in June 2014. 
Port then drugged Anthony with GHB and raped him. He died after being given a fatal overdose of the drug. In the early morning of 19 June, Port dragged Anthony's body to the pavement outside his flat and used his own mobile phone to call an ambulance. He didn't give his name but told an operator that he had been driving past and had seen a ""young boy"" looking unwell. Port then returned to his flat.
A paramedic who checked Anthony's body requested that police attend the scene. They arrived shortly afterwards with homicide detectives. 
Anthony's phone was missing, his underpants were on back-to-front, and he had bruising under his arms consistent with being moved by another person. The cause of death would eventually be attributed to a GHB overdose, although friends would tell police during their inquiries he was not a GHB user. This in itself should have been seen as critical.
At the police station, a trace of the mobile phone number showed that the caller - Stephen Port - lived in the flat right next to where Anthony's body was found.
Police visited him and he immediately changed his account of what happened. The bus garage chef claimed he had returned from a night-shift to find ""a male lying in my front door"" and had called 999.
A police records check at the station revealed Port had previously been accused of drugging and raping a teenager, but somehow investigators on the ground did not become aware of this for several days. 
The case was then left with local officers from Barking, rather than being taken on by a specialist Scotland Yard murder investigation team. 
Anthony's mother Sarah Sak says the call she received from police was so brief it was like a discussion about a lost pet. She says police liaison officer, DS Paul Slaymaker, described Anthony's death as ""not suspicious at the moment"".
But she knew this was wrong. ""It just started literally from day one. They just weren't interested - they just didn't listen to any of us,"" she tells the BBC. 
Anthony's friends, who also realised something was seriously amiss, told officers he had travelled to Barking to meet a new client who called himself Joe Deen. Anthony had shared a photo of the man with them - and that person turned out to be Stephen Port.
Port was arrested for lying to police about his dealings with Anthony, and was questioned at Barking police station - but only by a junior borough detective on his own. The killer gave a rambling and inconsistent account, ultimately claiming the deceased had visited his flat, died after taking his own drugs, and he only placed Anthony outside after panicking. 
At the recent inquests, the junior officer revealed that he thought Port had killed Anthony and that an experienced homicide team should have carried out the interview.
At this point, DCI Tony Kirk, head of Barking and Dagenham CID, asked for a murder inquiry team to take over. He messaged a senior Scotland Yard homicide detective to say Port had previously drugged and raped someone and that, on balance, it appeared Anthony had died ""at the hands of another"". 
He added: ""I feel we as an organisation have a duty to his friends and family to get to the bottom of his death in what are increasingly suspicious circumstances."" 
The request was refused, but specialist detectives were sent to interview Port. They obtained more information from him, yet, according to details from the inquests, failed to follow a basic interview strategy or challenge Port on things he said.   
Unprompted, the killer revealed that he had previously been searched and questioned by police at Barking railway station after helping out a friend who was unwell. 
Officers thought this information seemed significant and left a note for the borough team. But nothing was done to establish any more detail and Port was released on bail.
A police intelligence log, available on a national database, would have shown Port was referring to an incident two weeks before Anthony's death, when British Transport Police were called to reports of him assaulting an unwell man at Barking station. But a basic check wasn't made.
Port had claimed the man had possibly taken ""G"" - a reference to GHB - and he had found him on drugs outside the flat after they met online.  It was not until more than a year later - by which time four men had been killed - that a murder investigation team traced the victim of the assault. He described having been surreptitiously drugged, waking naked and disoriented in Port's flat. 
Homicide officers now accept they would have taken on the case had they known about the incident. 
Months after Port's police interviews, he was charged with perverting the course of justice for lying about his dealings with Anthony. But nothing more was done to investigate the death itself - Scotland Yard's homicide division was not contacted again by Barking officers despite an order for them to be updated and consulted on developments. 
The inquests would also hear that, at that time, formal advice from homicide officers to check a laptop and phone belonging to Port was ignored. Had they been sent for forensic analysis Port's obsession with drugging and raping young men would have been uncovered.
When they were eventually analysed the following year - after a request from a coroner - they showed that Port had persistently watched ""drug rape"" pornography. Even then, a detective failed to even look at the relevant sections of the forensic report. By then, police had closed their investigation.
An interaction with a coroner showed the investigation's poor grasp of key details.
DS Martin O'Donnell, who was managing the inquiry, told the coroner that Port ""stated he hadn't used escorts before and didn't know about the costs"" even though he had told detectives he used male prostitutes and had worked as an escort himself. 
Anthony's mother, Sarah Sak, was so concerned by the lapsed police investigation and unhappy with her liaison officer, DS Slaymaker, that she was forced to approach her MP for help.
The killer had ""literally got away with murder"", Ms Sak says now. She believes detectives ""just couldn't be bothered"" to investigate properly. 
While he was on bail, Port went on to kill two more young men.
Gabriel Kovari, a 22-year-old from Slovakia who was planning to work as a translator, became Port's flatmate in August 2014. He was killed within days. 
His body was discovered by a dog-walker in a Barking graveyard near Port's flat. Like Anthony, his mobile phone was missing and he was eventually found to have died due to a GHB overdose. 
Police treated the death as unexplained but not suspicious. The resulting inquiries were shallow. 
John Pape, with whom Gabriel had lived in south London for several weeks, was contacted as his was the last known address. Pape said that Gabriel had headed east, but he did not know where. 
Detectives could have discovered that he moved to Cooke Street - where Port lived - if they had sought out a man who helped Gabriel move to Barking. The young Slovakian had sent his friend a map showing the new residence and several photos from inside Port's flat.
In September 2014, three weeks after Gabriel died, the body of Daniel Whitworth was found in exactly the same spot of the same graveyard by the same dogwalker. Daniel, too, had died of a GHB overdose, and his phone was missing. 
The ambitious young chef lived in Gravesend and had no connection to Barking. On him was an apparent suicide note claiming he had accidentally killed Gabriel, and had taken his own life as a result. The note had actually been written by Stephen Port, but police fell for his lies.
Taken at face value, which the police did, since the note referred to an apparent homicide, Scotland Yard policy demanded a murder investigation team take the lead. 
Homicide detectives were consulted, but the death was never investigated by them. Again, the case remained with local officers. Their performance was a disaster. No forensic tests were conducted on items found with Daniel and Gabriel. Had they been, Port would have been identified since his DNA was on record.
Police could have established the ""suicide note"" was fake if they had scrutinised it properly. It was not sent to a handwriting expert, despite promises being made to Daniel's family. 
His father Adam Whitworth was emailed a small piece of the note, with DC Yinka Adeyemo-Phillips of Barking police then telling officers that he had confirmed the writing as Daniel's.
But Mr Whitworth says he never confirmed it, and says he has ""no idea"" how the detective decided he did.
""She has done an abominable thing there and it's led to tragic consequences,"" he says. 
The note also stated ""btw please do not blame the guy I was with last night"". Officers failed to establish that person's identity. If they had, it would have led them to Stephen Port.
Weeks after Daniel's death, his father was shown the full note by DS Slaymaker, who also worked on the Anthony Walgate inquiry. 
""The first thing I said to him was, there's nothing in here that identifies it as Daniel, there's no names of anybody, there's no words and phrases that he would use,"" says Mr Whitworth.
""Slaymaker had an opportunity there in that room, when we was telling him our concerns, to put that right."" 
Detectives also refused to show the note to Daniel's long-term partner, Ricky Waumsley, with whom he shared a home and a bank account, after refusing to class him as next of kin. 
He says ""I felt like I was being put to one side and I felt like they were being homophobic towards me. If it was a straight woman who'd been found dead, and that was my partner, I think I would have been treated very, very differently.""
Questioned about Daniel's whereabouts at the time Gabriel had died in east London, Ricky Waumsley checked his phone and told officers they appeared to have been together at home in Kent, far from Barking. 
This gave Daniel an alibi and meant he could not have killed Gabriel. But officers ignored this fundamental point. DS Slaymaker, was ordered to get mobile phone data, which would have shown Daniel's real location on the key date, but failed to do so.  
In reality, the victims never met one another. 
Mandy Whitworth, Daniel's stepmother, says being told by police that Daniel was a killer was incredibly distressing.  ""I don't think I can even tell you not only how angry that has made us, but how deeply that has wounded us for life.""
Detectives also ignored a series of warnings about the two deaths being linked to that of Anthony Walgate. 
Gabriel's former flatmate John Pape and boyfriend Thierry Amodio both suggested there might be link, after reading an anonymised local newspaper report about the earlier death. But they were ignored. 
Amodio, making his own inquiries, ended up in contact with a Facebook user calling himself Jon Luck. This person appeared to know important information about the last days of Gabriel and Daniel and made alarming suggestions about parties at which young men were drugged and exploited. He was plainly a central witness. 
Amodio sent the Facebook account to DC Adeyemo-Phillips but nothing was done to investigate the account or the person behind it. It turned out to be a fake account used by Stephen Port to spread lies.
Officers did not bother taking a statement from Amodio, who lived in Spain, and refused to keep him updated as they did not regard him as 'next of kin'. 
When Amodio resorted to emailing the local coroner for information, one of the leading detectives on the case - DS Debbie Turrell - wrote to her colleague that he was ""fishing for information"". 
Pape persistently contacted detectives to raise concerns about the threat to gay men, but he was totally ignored. In one email he wrote: I worry about what is happening to young men in Barking"".
He resorted to asking LGBT organisations to contact the Met, but the force continued to be dismissive.
The officer who ignored Pape's warnings was DC Jacqueline Baxter, who had also been appointed as ""family liaison officer"" for Gabriel's family in Slovakia.
But she failed in her role by not making any effort to contact them. 
DC Baxter then misled a coroner's officer. In an email, she wrongly stated that ""uniformed officers kept this case as it was not deemed suspicious.
She then named the wrong country by stating, ""I just dealt with the burial company in Lithuania"". 
The inquests also heard about serious failings by DI Rolf Schamberger, who oversaw the Barking and Dagenham Police team that examined the deaths of Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth.
He signed off a series of actions as complete, even though they had not been carried out, such as the crucial demand to obtain phone data on Daniel. 
Schamberger personally prepared flawed reports for the men's first inquests, which took place in June 2015, giving evidence at both. 
He falsely told the coroner that a ""diary"" had been used to confirm Daniel Whitworth's handwriting on the suicide note, even though no diary was ever seized. 
Having been asked at Gabriel's first inquest in 2015 about a possible link to the death of Anthony Walgate, the detective said ""there was consideration given to there being a link, but, to the best of my knowledge, no link was ever established"". 
The officer, who has since been promoted, claimed at this year's inquest not to have known anything about Anthony's case at the time, saying it is ""hard to say"" what he meant in his answer back then. 
In 2015, Schamberger told the coroner that no testing had taken place on a bedsheet found with Daniel's body, contrary to a pathologist's recommendation, adding the ""circumstances at the time indicated towards no other external parties being involved"". 
He now says he ""can't really explain"" that answer, given the investigation had considered the possibility that other people might have been involved.  
The bedsheet was covered in the killer's DNA. 
Even before the pathologist's report on Daniel had concluded, the detective had written ""the investigation is complete and the report can be closed"". 
Jack Taylor was found dead in September 2015, slumped against the other side of the graveyard wall to where Gabriel and Daniel had been discovered. 
Like the other three young men, his phone was missing and he died of a GHB overdose. Like the others, he was not a user of drugs, meaning the circumstances were unusual.
Despite some detectives attending the scene who had been present at the earlier deaths, no connection was made to them. Officers decided Jack's death was non-suspicious.  
The Taylor family were briefly visited and told that Jack had died, but then heard nothing more from police. 
PC Jon Taylor, whose job was to patrol local parks, found out he was running the investigation from a digital crime report entry, rather than because anyone told him.  He was not a detective but had been put in charge because he had been the person flagged down in the street when the body was discovered. 
He asked for help from the local CID team - the same unit that had run inquiries into the earlier deaths - but a detective refused and stated: ""I deal with more protracted/unexplained deaths"". 
Almost a fortnight had passed when Donna Taylor, Jack's sister, contacted the Met, furious at the lack of contact. 
In that time Donna and younger sister Jenny had launched their own investigation, spotting the links to the earlier deaths. 
""We should never have had to investigate and do everything behind the scenes ourselves,"" says Jenny Taylor. ""Why couldn't they have done that? Saying they didn't have enough resources or enough training, we've got no training, we had no resources, we had a laptop - that's all we had - and it makes us very angry."" 
The Taylor family kept pushing the police to do more. 
For example, when police confirmed there was CCTV of Jack meeting a tall man at Barking station and walking away together, the Taylor sisters insisted that officers issue a public appeal to identify the stranger. At first, officers refused to do so, but relented following pressure from the sisters. 
It was one of the original Anthony Walgate detectives who recognised the tall blonde stranger as Stephen Port after seeing the appeal images on a colleague's desk. 
Donna Taylor says the Met ""didn't look into anything"" and have ""allowed that man to take three innocent people's lives"". 
Families of the dead men say the Met made false assumptions about their loved ones, with homophobia playing a role in the flawed decision-making.
Scotland Yard accepts failing the victims, but denies that prejudice was a factor.
Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said: ""I don't think the Met is an institutionally homophobic organisation. I do think that we need to make a great deal of change to our investigative practices. We have done that - and people need to be reassured that we have done that.""
Seventeen police officers involved in the original response into the four deaths were investigated by the police watchdog.
The Independent Office for Police Conduct did not refer any of them for misconduct proceedings. Seven of the officers have since been promoted.
The Taylor sisters, whose persistence led the police to the killer, say they will not accept this result. ""We've never gone away - the Taylor family, the Taylor sisters - will never will go away. We want to see people held accountable.""

141;South Africa's Zondo commission report: Scandal, bullying and fear;['2022-01-05T16:41:01.000Z'];['By Mo Allie'];['bbc world service - africa today'];['mr', 'mere', 'commission', 'report', 'occurred', 'bullying', 'seizing', 'moyane', 'zondo', 'inevitable', 'south', 'fear', 'africas', 'sars', 'set', 'mismanagement', 'scandal', 'moment'];"
It reads like a playbook on how to corrupt a government. 
Scandals and a systematic process of ridding key personnel from important government departments and lucrative state-owned enterprises, then replacing them with close allies and pliant officials were hallmarks of Jacob Zuma's nine-year term as president of South Africa, a damning report has found.
In his mammoth 874-page report into allegations of high-level corruption under Zuma, Judge Raymond Zondo found that the former president advanced the interests of the Indian-born Gupta family and close allies at the expense of the people of South Africa. 
Both Zuma and the Gupta family have previously denied any wrongdoing.
The inquiry found there were patterns of abuse at every stage of public procurement and that governance had collapsed at state companies.
The process, referred to as ""state capture"", describes a form of corruption in which businesses and politicians conspire to influence a country's decision-making process to advance their own interests. 
The Guptas, who moved to South Africa in 1993, owned a wide-ranging portfolio of companies that enjoyed lucrative contracts with South African government departments and state-owned companies. 
They also employed several Zuma family members - including the president's son, Duduzane - in senior positions.
Tax authority targeted
Justice Zondo found that the South African Revenue Services (Sars), once regarded as a world-class tax institution, was one of the key departments targeted for state capture because ""its investigatory and enforcement capacity was a hurdle to people involved in organized crime"".
Under the leadership of Tom Moyane, a Zuma ally, the institution was systematically and deliberately weakened, the report found. 
More than 2,000 highly skilled senior staff members were lost, including investigators who were hounded out through a pervasive culture of fear and bullying.
""Zuma promised the job of Sars commissioner to Tom Moyane well ahead of the appointment being made despite the process then underway to select the appropriate person from amongst a large number of candidates,"" the report said. 
""The only feasible conclusion is that the organization was deliberately captured and President Zuma and Mr Moyane played critical roles in the capture of Sars and dismantling it in the way it was done during Mr Moyane's term as Commissioner.
""What occurred at Sars was inevitable the moment Mr Moyane set foot there. He dismantled the elements of governance one by one. This was more than mere mismanagement. It was seizing control of Sars as if it was his to have,"" it continued. 
The Commission recommends that Mr Moyane ""be charged with perjury in relation to his false evidence presented to parliament.""
No recommendations to charge him with corruption have been made so far, nor has he made any comment in the wake of the report. 
Also heavily implicated is another close Zuma ally and former South African Airways (SAA) Board Chairperson, Dudu Myeni, her son Thalente, and several other former senior SAA officials.
Under Ms Myeni's watch, SAA descended into ""an entity racked by corruption and fraud"", the report says. 
Justice Zondo found that there was ""overwhelming and corroborated"" evidence that Ms Myeni was unlawfully benefitting from State Security Agency (SSA) resources and enjoyed the protection of undercover operatives, trained overseas in counterintelligence strategies and intelligence gathering.
The report noted that her links to top SSA officials revealed ""how powerful Ms Myeni was and how close she was to President Zuma"".
She has not commented.
Justice Zondo accused Zuma of fleeing the commission ""because he knew there were questions that would be put to him which he would not have been able to answer. This is the antithesis of accountability.""
Zuma refused to cooperate with the inquiry, arguing that Justice Zondo was biased against him. This led to the former president's imprisonment in July 2021 for contempt of court. 
He was released on medical parole in September before being ordered back to jail by the high court in December. 
Zuma has appealed against the decision and so remains on parole.
The commission's proceedings spanned more than 400 days over three years, with more than 300 witnesses appearing. More than 1.7 million pages of documents were presented as evidence. 
While the commission is an inquiry and has no prosecuting powers, an amended regulation passed by President Cyril Ramaphosa at the end of July allows law enforcement agencies to access information gained at the commission. 
It also allows for the commission's staff to take up employment or be appointed on a consultancy basis by law enforcement agencies in order to speed up prosecutions.
The National Prosecuting Authority has been battling to extradite the Gupta brothers, Atul, Rajesh and Tony.
Their current whereabouts are unknown, after they fled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2018, shortly after Zuma was removed from office.
It is likely that Zuma, Mr Moyane, Ms Myeni and others who have been implicated by Justice Zondo's report will want to have the findings tested in a court of law - as the revelations are not definitive. 
Given what has transpired over the past few years in state-capture related cases, a long, protracted legal battle is likely to ensue.
This was just the first of Justice Zondo's reports into allegations of corruption under Zuma. Two more will be published before the end of February.

At least 13 people have been killed and several more have been injured after a fire broke out in an apartment building in the US city of Philadelphia.
At least seven children are among the dead, an official from the Philadelphia Fire Department told reporters. 
The blaze began at around 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) in a public housing block in the north of the city. 
Deputy Fire Commissioner Craig Murphy told reporters it was one of the worst fires he had ever seen. 
""We plan on making sure that this tremendous loss of life did not happen in vain,"" he said on Wednesday.
He added that eight other residents had managed to escape the building.
It is believed there were 26 people in the three-storey block at the time of the fire.
The building is owned by the government funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, and it has been legally divided into two apartments since the 1950s. 
Officials said that at the last inspection of the building in 2020 there had been four working smoke detectors, but none of them went off during the fire.
Mr Murphy told reporters that while authorities do not currently consider the cause of the fire to be suspicious, there will still be a thorough investigation due to the loss of life.
Speaking during the press conference, the city's Mayor Jim Kenney said: ""This is without a doubt one of the most tragic days in our city's history, the loss of so many people in such a tragic way.""
""Losing so many kids is just devastating,"" he added.

143;James Webb Space Telescope extends secondary mirror;['2022-01-05T17:00:18.000Z'];['Jonathan Amos'];['astronomy', 'nasa', 'european space agency', 'the universe', 'james webb space telescope', 'hubble telescope', 'space exploration'];['main', 'space', 'webb', 'reflector', 'useless', 'secondary', 'telescopes', 'sitting', 'role', 'extends', 'observatory', 'telescope', 'mirror', 'sees', 'james'];"
Mission controllers are ticking off the final major deployments needed to set up the new James Webb Space Telescope.
Wednesday saw the observatory's secondary mirror locked into position on the end of three 8m-long booms.
It sets the stage for the all-important unpacking of Webb's giant primary mirror - the biggest reflecting surface ever sent into orbit.
At 6.5m across, this segmented feature will pick up the light from the very first stars to ignite in the cosmos.
The mirror's great size will enable it to gather the faintest signals in the most exquisite detail.
But the reflector will be useless if the light it collects cannot be directed into the telescope's instruments. This is the role of the 74cm-wide secondary mirror. Sitting out in front, it will bounce back into the heart of the observatory whatever the main mirror sees.
This video can not be played
Like many of Webb's components, the secondary mirror had to be folded to fit inside the mission's 25-December launch rocket.
It was actually flat-packed up against the main mirror, with one of its three booms given a hinge joint to make sure everything was tucked in tight. 
Controllers at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Maryland, US, sent the commands on Wednesday to drive the booms into their proper, stretched-out configuration.
This occurred in two carefully controlled movements, which ended with the tripod frame being latched and locked to prevent any future displacement at 16:52 GMT.
""Another banner day for JWST,"" said Bill Ochs, the US space agency's (Nasa) Webb programme manager. ""We actually have a telescope.""
Next up for Webb is the main mirror itself. Its deployment should occur over the next couple of days.
At launch, this mirror looked a bit like a drop-leaf table with two edges swept back.
These ""wings"" must now be rotated through 90 degrees to achieve the desired 6.5m-wide concave shape.
All 18 segments have been made from the metal beryllium, which is light-weight and holds its shape at very low temperatures. The gold coating makes for near-perfect reflection in the infrared - the wavelength of light in which the pioneer stars will be seen to shine.
Webb succeeds the Hubble Space Telescope, which, when it was launched in 1990, had a major defect in its primary mirror.
Scientists realised very quickly on receiving the first pictures that the reflector hadn't been polished correctly.
It wasn't until astronauts could take up some corrective optics that Hubble started to see the cosmos with clarity. 
Webb won't have this problem.
""The segments on the primary mirror have actuators behind them that allow us to move them around, to even change their curvature,"" explained Lee Feinberg, the US space agency (Nasa) engineer in charge of Webb's mirror system. 
""When first deployed in space, those segments will be misaligned. But all those actuators will take us from a misalignment measured in millimetres, all the way down to just nanometres. A factor of a million improvement.""
In other words, Webb will be focused in space, a task that will begin in about a month's time.
The new observatory has been designed to look deeper into the Universe than Hubble and, as a consequence, detect events occurring further back in time - more than 13.5 billion years ago.
As well as looking for the earliest stars and galaxies, scientists also expect to use Webb's more advanced capabilities to study the atmospheres of distant planets in the hope that signs of life might be detected.
Webb is currently moving out to a position 1.5 million km from Earth on the planet's ""midnight"" side. It's from this location that it will study the Universe.
James Webb is a joint venture between the American, European and Canadian space agencies.

145;China: Is it burdening poor countries with unsustainable debt?;['2022-01-06T01:17:22.000Z'];['By Kai Wang'];['china', 'reality check'];['chinese', 'loans', 'world', 'debt', 'chinas', 'countries', 'lending', 'loan', 'unsustainable', 'burdening', 'sri', 'china', 'poor'];"
China has faced criticism for its lending practices to poorer countries, accused of leaving them struggling to repay debts and therefore vulnerable to pressure from Beijing.
But that is rejected by China, which accuses some in the West of promoting this narrative to tarnish its image.
It says: ""There is not a single country that has fallen into [a] so-called 'debt trap' as a result of borrowing from China.""
China is one of the world's largest single creditor nations. 
Its loans to lower and middle-income countries have tripled over the past decade, reaching $170bn (£125bn) by the end of 2020. 
However, China's overall lending commitments are likely to be significantly greater than these figures suggest.
Research by AidData, an international development body at William & Mary University in the US, finds that half of China's lending to developing countries is not reported in official debt statistics.
It is often kept off government balance sheets, directed to state-owned companies and banks, joint ventures or private institutions, rather than directly from government to government.  
There are now more than 40 low and middle-income countries, according to AidData, whose debt exposure to Chinese lenders is more than 10% of the size of their annual economic output (GDP) as a result of this ""hidden debt"".
Djibouti, Laos, Zambia and Kyrgyzstan have debts to China equivalent to at least 20% of their annual GDP. 
Much of the debt owed to China relates to large infrastructure projects like roads, railways and ports, and also to the mining and energy industry, under President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.  
In an interview with the BBC, Richard Moore, the head of Britain's foreign intelligence agency MI6, said China uses what he called ""debt traps"" to gain leverage over other countries. 
The claim is that China lends money to other countries, which end up having to cede control of key assets if they can't meet their debt repayments - an accusation that's been long denied by Beijing.
One example often cited by critics of China is Sri Lanka, which years ago embarked on a massive port project in Hambantota with Chinese investment. 
But the billion dollar project using loans and contractors from China became mired in controversy, and struggled to prove viable,  leaving Sri Lanka saddled with growing debts.
Finally, in 2017, Sri Lanka agreed to give state-owned China Merchants a controlling 70% stake in the port on a 99-year lease in return for further Chinese investment. 
Analysis of the port project by UK-based think tank Chatham House has questioned whether the ""debt trap"" narrative strictly applies, given that the deal was driven by local political motivations, and that China never took formal ownership of the port.
It points out that a large proportion of Sri Lanka's overall debt was owed to non-Chinese lenders, and that there's no that evidence China has taken advantage of its position to gain strategic military advantage from the port.
Despite that, there's little doubt China's economic involvement in Sri Lanka has grown in the past decade, and concerns persist that this could be used to advance its political ambitions in the region.
There are other parts of the world where Chinese lending has also proved controversial, with contracts whose terms could give China leverage over important assets.
But there are no cases, among the hundreds of loan arrangements studied by AidData and some other researchers, of Chinese state-owned lenders actually seizing a major asset in the event of a loan default.
China does not publish records of its foreign loans, and the majority of its contracts contain non-disclosure clauses which prevent borrowers from revealing their contents. 
It argues that such confidentiality is common practice for international loan contracts.
""Confidentiality agreements are very common in international commercial loans"", says Professor Lee Jones at Queen Mary University of London. 
""And much of China's development financing is fundamentally a commercial operation.""
Most of the major industrialised nations share information about their lending activities through membership of what's known as the Paris Club.  
China has chosen not to join this grouping, but using available World Bank data, the rapid growth in China's reported lending compared to others can be clearly observed.
China tends to lend at higher rates of interest than western governments.
At around 4%, these loans are close to commercial market rates and about four times that of a typical loan from the World Bank or an individual country such as France or Germany.
The required repayment period for a Chinese loan is also generally shorter - less than 10 years, compared to around 28 years for other lenders' concessional loans to developing countries.
Chinese state-owned lenders also typically require borrowers to maintain a minimum cash balance in an offshore account to which the lender has access. 
""If a borrower fails to repay its debt,"" says Brad Parks, Executive Director of AidData, ""China can simply debit funds from [this] account without having to collect on bad debt through a judicial process.""
This approach is rarely seen in loans issued by western lenders.
There's currently an initiative by G20 nations - those countries which have the largest and fastest-growing economies - to offer debt relief for poorer countries to help them deal with the impact of the pandemic. 
China has joined this and says it has contributed ""the highest amount of debt repayment"" of any country taking part in the plan.
The World Bank says that since May 2020, a total of more than $10.3bn has been delivered in debt relief by G20 countries under this scheme.
But when we asked the World Bank for a breakdown by country, it said it could not share the information.

146;Caviar sales soar as more people get a taste for posh fish eggs;['2022-01-06T00:04:16.000Z'];['By Dan Gibson'];['fish', 'fish farming'];['eggs', 'mr', 'soar', 'taste', 'company', 'going', 'caviar', 'sales', 'fish', 'public', 'posh', 'sector', 'farms', '15', 'hot', 'roll', 'fernandez'];"
When high-end restaurants around the globe had to close their doors during the Covid lockdowns, things didn't look good for the world's caviar producers.
Add glitzy events being cancelled, and cruise liners not being able to leave port, and you might think that it spelled disaster for the sellers of wincingly expensive fish eggs.
But the reality has been very different. Online sales are booming as the well-heeled increasingly eat their caviar at home.
""I think people in lockdown wanted to enjoy themselves, and everybody decided to spend money on caviar, either at home, or in restaurants [when they were able to open again],"" says Carla Sora, general manager of Italy's Agroittica Lombarda, Europe's largest caviar farm.
But what exactly is caviar? It is the salt-cured eggs of numerous species of the sturgeon fish. Long considered a delicacy, the industry was historically centred on wild stocks in the Caspian Sea, which is today surrounded by Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Azerbaijan.
But by 2006, severe overfishing in the Caspian led to a ban on the global sale of almost all wild caviar from the sea. This is still enforced by the Switzerland-based Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.
The ban led to a big growth in the farming of sturgeon around the world specifically for the production of caviar. As a result, almost all of the caviar sold legally worldwide is now from farmed stocks - sturgeon reared in man-made lakes and ponds.
This global farmed sturgeon industry was worth €750m ($848m; £640m) in 2019, according to the most recent figures from Norwegian firm Kontali, which monitors the worldwide fish farm sector. Meanwhile, the European Union estimated that global caviar volumes reached 380 tonnes in 2018, its most up to date figures.
Ms Sora says that sales at Agroittica Lombarda soared last year, especially in the US, where they doubled.
Meanwhile, US firm Sterling Caviar, owner of four farms in California, and the largest caviar producer in the country, said its sales were up 10% in 2021. In the UK, the sole sturgeon farmer, Exmoor Caviar, sold out of all of its then stock at the end of 2020.
Kontali analyst, Maren Boe, says that online sales have ""been the saving grace"" for producers since the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic.
""By selling smaller tins of caviar, both in shops and online, producers have been able to sell to consumers looking to increase everyday luxury by buying caviar to consume at home,"" she says.
Sterling owner, Eugene Fernandez, says that its online sales soared 60% last year, helped by launching a new website in August. He thinks that caviar fans now want to eat it on a more regular basis.
""I think going forward the caviar market will probably be less of an occasional product for holidays, and more something that's bought regularly,"" he says.
Ms Sora adds that producers in the US and Europe have also benefitted from less caviar exports coming from China, whose farms account for 70% of global production. China's domestic consumption of caviar has soared in recent years, at the same time as there might have been some staff shortages caused by the pandemic.
New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.
But why is caviar so expensive? At Exmoor, its cheapest tin costs £14, but that only gets you 10 grams - less than a teaspoon's worth. By contrast, its most expensive costs £4,800 for one kilogram.
Much of the high cost is down to the fact that female sturgeon take a long time to reach egg-laying maturity. For the Siberian sturgeon, the main species farmed at Exmoor, this takes between four and five years. For the white sturgeon at Agroittica Lombarda the females don't start laying eggs until they are 14 years old.
Critics of sturgeon farms, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, argue that farming any fish is cruel, as it keeps them in an artificially confined space. The female sturgeons are also generally killed before their eggs are harvested.
""Caviar is something no-one needs,"" says Sascha Camilli, Peta's senior PR coordinator. ""On fish farms, sturgeons are smashed together to swim in crowded, barren tanks, or netted areas polluted with the waste from thousands of fish.""
The caviar industry counters that the sturgeon meat is also sold for eating, that farmed stocks can bolster critically endangered wild numbers, and that the welfare of the fish has to be their main priority.
Exmoor's chief executive Kenneth Benning says that, despite the recent boom, there is no certainty that caviar sales will continue to rise so strongly because demand for the expensive premium product is greatly affected by economic uncertainty.
""The reality is that disposable income is [likely] going to be less, particularly in the UK,"" he says. ""There's a lot of people out there in the world who basically cannot justify spending £20 on a 10 gram tin.
""We've been on an upward trajectory, but I think that that's from the marketing perspective, and from building customers who've come back to buy the product again.""
By contrast, Mr Fernandez expects growth to continue to grow rapidly, and Sterling intends to acquire a further 240 acres of land to expand its existing farms.
""We'll do a roll up of another five or 15 farms over the next three to four years and take the company public,"" says Mr Fernandez. ""This is going to be a hot sector for the next five to 10 years - at least.""
At Exmoor, the plans for the future are more high tech - it has filed a patent for the development of lab-grown caviar from sturgeon stem cells. This technology is already under development for other fish, such as tuna.
""With cellular aquaculture, we believe we can produce the egg we need within 40 days,"" says Mr Benning. ""If we had excess demand, we could meet it in a moment.
""In a room that is less than 300 square meters, we can produce more caviar than the entire annual global production. If you can provide the products, it's the same genetic material and it doesn't involve the captivity or killing of an animal - it's a no-brainer.""
If all goes to plan, Exmoor - which is working with partners in Switzerland, Germany and Eastern Europe - intends to launch its cell-cultivated caviar in 2023.
But would this mean the end of the farmed sturgeon industry? Mr Benning doesn't think so. He says that some people will always want to buy natural rather than lab-grown caviar.

147;Kazakhstan country profile;['2019-08-09T14:46:02.000Z'];['BBC News'];['bbc kazakh'];['populated', 'sparsely', 'siberian', 'regions', 'stretches', 'steppes', 'south', 'kazakhstan', 'country', 'terrain', 'profile', 'varied', 'west'];"
A huge country the size of Western Europe, Kazakhstan has vast mineral resources and enormous economic potential.
The varied landscape stretches from the mountainous, heavily populated regions of the east to the sparsely populated, energy-rich lowlands in the west, and from the industrialised north, with its Siberian climate and terrain, through the arid, empty steppes of the centre, to the fertile south.
Ethnically the former Soviet republic is as diverse, with the Kazakhs making up nearly two thirds of the population, ethnic Russians just under a quarter, and smaller minorities the rest. Suppressed under Soviet rule, the main religion, Islam, is undergoing a revival. 
Since independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, major investment in the oil sector has brought rapid economic growth, and eased some of the stark disparities in wealth of the 1990s. 
President: Kassym-Jomart Tokayev 
A long-standing colleague of independent Kazakhstan's founder, Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev took over as president when his mentor suddenly stepped down in March 2019.
Mr Tokayev was chairman of the Senate at the time, and says he will continue the policies of his predecessor and rely on his opinion in key policy matters. 
He won a snap presidential election in June 2019 to consolidate his position.
The new president has served in various senior positions since independence in 1991, including prime minister and foreign minister.
Nursultan Nazarbayev's long authoritarian rule faced few challenges from weak opposition parties, and he managed a gradual transfer of power that guarantees him a future role as chairman for life of a newly-strengthened Security Council.
In addition, his daughter Dariga has succeeded Mr Tokayev as head of the Senate, raising her profile as a potential successor. 
The media market is dominated by state-owned and pro-government outlets.

President Joe Biden has heavily criticised former President Donald Trump on the first anniversary of the attack on the US Capitol.
In a televised speech Mr Biden accused his predecessor of spreading ""a web of lies"" that led to the mob's assault. 
Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on 6 January 2021 as Congress gathered to certify Mr Biden's presidential election victory.
Live footage of US politicians cowering from the mob shocked the world.
Mr Trump had urged protesters at a rally outside the White House shortly beforehand to ""peacefully"" march on Congress, but he also encouraged them to ""fight"" and stirred up the crowd with unsubstantiated claims of mass voter fraud in the election he had just lost. 
Shortly after Mr Biden's speech on Thursday Mr Trump released an angry statement hitting out at his successor. In it, he accused Mr Biden of ""failure"" and repeated false claims about the election. 
Democrat politicians, who have a majority in the US Congress, planned a number of events to mark the one-year anniversary of the attack - including a candlelit vigil outside the Capitol building.
Many spoke about their experiences of the day, including sheltering and hiding from the rioters along with young members of staff.
A House committee is conducting an inquiry, and so far investigators have arrested 725 suspects in connection with the riot. 
Mr Biden condemned the attackers and Mr Trump in his speech on Thursday, using some of his strongest language yet about both the Capitol riots and his predecessor.
""Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated this incidence, held a dagger at the throat of America and American democracy"", Mr Biden said in Statuary Hall, a section of the Capitol complex that was breached by rioters.
""They came here in rage, not in the service of America, but rather, in the service of one man.
""The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election... His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our constitution"". 
The US leader also warned that the threats to American democracy ""have not abated.""

Later in the day House Speaker Nancy Pelosi presided over a moment of silence on the chamber floor. She praised police officers who defended lawmakers and other people who were sheltered inside as the riot raged. 
""The insurrectionists targeted more than just the building. They targeted democracy itself,"" she said. 
Some Republicans skipped the day's commemorative gatherings. The party's Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, led a delegation to the funeral of a former senator in Atlanta, Georgia. 
Meanwhile Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene - two provocative pro-Trump members of the House - held a news conference at the Capitol billed as a ""Republican response"" to the day's events. 
They repeated unsubstantiated theories that the attack was fuelled by federal agents.
The mother of Ashli Babblit, a US Air Force veteran who died after being shot by police while trying to storm the House of Representatives, has been speaking outside of Congress. 
""She was a patriot. She served this country her whole adult life,"" Micki Witthoeft told the Alabama-based Right Side Broadcasting Network.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, in a tweet, accused Mr Biden of ""brazen politicisation"" of the 6 January riot.  
Last January, Joe Biden gave an inaugural address outside the US Capitol that focused on national healing and unity.
Now, standing in the centre of the building nearly a year later - after it has become clear that the nation is as divided as ever - Biden put unifying rhetoric aside and took dead aim at Donald Trump and his supporters.
In some of the sharpest words directed at his predecessor since the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden condemned Trump's continued efforts to question the legitimacy of that election.
Not only that, he blasted Republicans who continue to stand behind the former president and endorsed national efforts to enact election reform to counter what he said were Trump-backed attempts to undermine voting rights.
This is an election year in America, with control of the US Congress and several key states hanging in the balance.
Biden's rhetorical shift could represent a strategic shift, as well - a decision that the Democratic base can most effectively be rallied with anger, not hope.

149;Kew scientists name new tree after Leonardo DiCaprio;['2022-01-06T11:24:36.000Z'];['By Helen Briggs'];['madagascar', 'conservation', 'plants', 'kew gardens', 'biodiversity'];['kew', 'oil', 'species', 'thought', 'dicaprio', 'plants', 'leonardo', 'used', 'primrose', 'mining', 'scientists', 'risk', 'wild', 'orchids', 'tree'];"
A tree that is new to science has been named after Leonardo DiCaprio.
Scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, say they wanted to honour the star for his help in saving a rainforest from logging.
The tree, which has been given the official name, Uvariopsis dicaprio, grows only in the Cameroon forest known for its incredible biodiversity.
""We think he was crucial in helping to stop the logging of the Ebo Forest,"" said Dr Martin Cheek of Kew.
Scientists and conservationists were horrified when they heard of plans to allow vast swathes of the Ebo Forest to be opened up for logging.
One of the largest relatively untouched rainforests in Central Africa, it is home to the Banen people and an array of unique flora and fauna, including threatened gorillas, chimps and forest elephants.
International experts wrote a letter to the government documenting the precious animal and plant species at risk of extinction. The issue was picked up by DiCaprio, whose social media posts to his millions of followers added momentum to the campaign.
The government later revoked plans to allow logging, although the forest has yet to be officially designated a national park.
""This could just be a stay of execution,"" Dr Cheek added.
The ""dicaprio"" tree is the first plant new to science to be officially named by Kew scientists in 2022, through publication in the scientific journal, PeerJ.
The small tropical evergreen tree has glossy yellow flowers that grow from its trunk. A member of the ylang ylang family, it has been found only in a small area of the forest and is critically endangered.
Last year, more than 200 plants and fungi from across the word were officially named by Kew scientists and their collaborators, including a pink lily from the same forest, an insect-trapping wild tobacco plant found in Australia and an orchid with star-like flowers from the island of Madagascar that can grow in darkness.
Several of these new species are already extinct and many are threatened due to deforestation, land clearance and droughts, floods and fires driven by climate change.
Of 16 new species of orchids found in Madagascar, three are thought to be extinct in the wild due to destruction of their habitat. One has disappeared due to forests being chopped down to grow plants for geranium oil used in the aromatherapy industry in Europe.  And a new Cape primrose from Katanga in Congo is at risk from copper mining.
Until a species has a scientific name, assessment of its extinction risk is near impossible, which makes protection from extinction very difficult. 
Dr Martin Cheek said the list of show-stopping discoveries from 2021 is another reminder that this is our last chance to find unknown species, name them and protect them before they become extinct.
""There are still thousands of plant species and maybe millions of fungal species out there that we don't know about,"" he said. ""This natural habitat that they're growing in - especially forests, but other habitats too, is increasingly and more rapidly being destroyed by us humans without knowing what's there.""

150;The man who ran all of Glasgow's 6,000 streets;['2022-01-06T07:51:09.000Z'];['By Steven Brocklehurst'];['every single glasgow street – a journal of running 6,000 streets by michael shanks'];['street', 'match', '6000', 'streets', 'ran', 'inefficiency', 'michael', 'man', 'written', 'running', 'challenges', 'speed', 'trying', 'intended', 'glasgows'];"
""I get lost quite a lot,"" Michael Shanks admits. ""My map reading is atrocious.
""And inevitably you end up running the same street several times.""
Over the past two years Michael has run along every single street, road and lane on the map of Glasgow - but he says he is more of an explorer than an athlete.
In total he has run more than 2,300km (1,400 miles), double the actual length of the city's 6,100-plus streets.
Michael, a 33-year-old modern studies teacher, started his mammoth task as a way of making the most of his limited exercise hours during the first Covid lockdown in March 2020.
""I realised I tended to run broadly the same route round the west end of Glasgow where I live,"" he says.
""Even streets that were pretty close to me I had just never gone down."" 
He started adding new streets and venturing to different areas, then eventually started to consult maps and plan his routes.
His research led him to Rickey Gates, who had run every street in San Francisco in 2018. The ultra runner did it in just 45 days, clocking up an average of 29 miles a day.
Michael says he never intended to match the American's speed, but he had written about the challenges such as trying to avoid the inefficiency of running the same street again and again.
This creates a mathematical conundrum - how do you travel along every road in a city with the least possible distance?
""Cul-de-sacs are a nightmare,"" Michael says. 
""There is nothing you can do but run all the way to the end of it and then all the way back. 
""New housing schemes are the worst because they are just full of dead ends. That adds a lot of mileage.""
But Michael reserved the accolade of ""least favourite street"" for a bit of Moray Gardens in the south of the city. When he finally found it, the road turned out to be an extremely steep, muddy track surrounded by a forest.
Some parts of the city are well-suited to his task, such as Garthamlock and Craigend, which were built in the 1950s and 1960s with roads that are linked by pedestrian lanes.
The traditional gridiron layout of many of Glasgow's tenements is also good for methodically ticking off streets, but there are some areas where it is less clear.
Parts of Easterhouse and Possilpark are full of streets where the tenements were demolished 20 years ago and nature has reclaimed most of it.
However, these ""ghost streets"" are still mapped so Michael had to run them.
""I nearly got run over by a dirt bike in Possilpark,"" he says. 
""I turned a corner and there it was right in front of me.
""I think my mother would rather I did not run down some of these streets.""
Michael is quick to add that despite Glasgow's enduring ""no mean city"" reputation, he has never encountered any trouble on any of his runs through some of the most deprived communities in the UK.
""I can honestly say there is not a single run in any part of the city where I have thought: 'I need to get out of here quickly',"" he says.
""I think that is testament to the fact the city has changed a lot.
""I have found people unfailingly friendly when it is obvious I don't know where I'm going."" 
He adds: ""I'm not a very good runner so usually I pretend to check the map to get my breath back. 
""I see people looking and I say: 'I'm not lost, I'm just trying to run every street.' That's an obvious conversation starter.""
People are usually keen to tell him all about their area, which helps Michael collect information for a book he is planning on the social history of Glasgow.
He has been inspired by a book from 1860 called Rambles Around Glasgow by Hugh Macdonald.
""I am never really going to be an athlete so it is not really a fitness challenge, it is an adventure,"" he says.
""I have been exploring.""
His exploration has uncovered some strange recurring themes.
""I have actually become a bit obsessed with 'no ball games' signs because they absolutely infuriate me,"" he says.
""It's not a relic of a bygone era because they are absolutely everywhere.
""That mentality which says kids should be seen and not heard really annoys me as a teacher.""
While ball games are often banned in housing schemes, Michael is also intrigued by football goalposts that crop up in the most unlikely places.
He also thinks he must be the only person to take a picture of every single Welcome to Glasgow sign, which he comes across every time he reaches the city council boundary.
Michael finished his challenge on Wednesday when he ran down the city centre's George Square, which he had saved for last. There he was greeted by family and friends.
He says he has enjoyed the challenge but is glad to see the back of it.
""I'm relieved but it's quite sad in a way,"" he says.
""I've enjoyed going on the adventure and I guess there is nowhere left to visit in Glasgow. I've been literally everywhere.
""But the map will update soon. There is housing being built all over and I won't be at 100% for very long. So I'll be back at it in a few weeks.""

151;Kazakhstan unrest: Why have there been riots and deaths?;['2022-01-06T15:54:20.000Z'];['BBC News'];['kazakhstan', 'russia', 'nursultan nazarbayev'];['security', 'russia', 'mr', 'riots', 'unrest', 'protesters', 'nazarbayev', 'killed', 'kazakhstan', 'president', 'deaths', 'say', 'source'];"
Security forces in Kazakhstan say they have killed dozens of protesters in the main city, Almaty, to quell massive riots.
Some 13 security officers have been killed, with hundreds more wounded in the unrest.
The protests followed a hike in the price of fuel.
Kazakhstan is a huge country, the size of western Europe, situated in Central Asia and bordering Russia and China. 
Made up mostly of mountains and arid steppe land, it has a population of only 19 million people. 
It gained independence in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
The country has some of the largest oil reserves in the world. It produces 1.6 million barrels of oil a day and has attracted billions of dollars in foreign investment.
However, the wealth has not trickled down to the population, who have an average income of less than £2,500 a year. 
For 18 years, Kazakhstan was ruled by President Nursultan Nazarbayev - a former Communist Party politburo member with strong links to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Statues of Mr Nazarbayev were erected and he built a new capital, Astana, which was later renamed Nur-Sultan in his honour.
He stood down in 2019, making way for current President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. 
Public protests in Kazakhstan are illegal without a government permit, and previous strikes and demonstrations have been dealt with very harshly. 
Demonstrations started on 2 January in the town of Zhanaozen, an oil hub and the site of deadly clashes between protesters and police just over 10 years ago.
Protests then spread across the rest of the country.
The security forces say they killed rioters in Almaty while trying to restore order. Police say protesters tried to take control of police stations in the city.
At least 12 members of the security forces have been killed and 353 injured, according to police.
Nationwide, about 1,000 people have reportedly been injured in the unrest, with 400 being treated in hospital and dozens in intensive care.
The protests began when the government lifted its price cap on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). 
Many Kazakhs converted their cars to use LPG because it was cheaper than other fuel. 
However, the government said it could not afford to continue subsidising LPG and its decision to remove the cap virtually doubled its price. 
However, the rioters appear to have other grievances. Some chanted the name of Mr Nazarbayev and tried to tear down a bronze statue of him. 
After stepping down as president, Mr Nazarbayev continued to hold a strong position in government as head of Kazakhstan's Security Council. He also appeared to be grooming his daughter Dariga as a future leader, according to observers.
To placate the protesters, Mr Nazarbayev has been removed from his post.
Russian paratroopers have been sent to Kazakhstan at the request of the Kazakh president to help ""stabilise"" the country. 
They were sent under the authority of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). 
This is a group of countries comprising Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, which was set up after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
The CSTO, which is currently chaired by Armenia, has blamed the trouble in Almaty on ""an invasion of bandit formations trained from abroad"".
Russia is keen to increase the military presence it already has in Kazakhstan protecting assets such as gas pipelines, Russian military bases and the Russian space station at Baikonur. 
Kazakhstan's government is making concessions. 
It has put off removing its price cap on LPG - ordering the prices of all vehicle fuel to be regulated for six months. 
Ministers have also resigned. President President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said the government had failed to carry out ""one of its main tasks -  keeping inflation in check"". The president has appointed Alikhan Smailov as acting prime minister.
The United States urged Kazakh authorities to show ""restraint"", saying protesters should be able to ""express themselves peacefully"".

152;Peter Bogdanovich: The Last Picture Show director dies aged 82;['2022-01-06T20:11:04.000Z'];['BBC News'];['film'];['director', 'tweeted', 'bogdanovich', 'aged', 'singlehandedly', 'pans', 'interviewed', 'labyrinth', 'guillermo', 'generation', 'lives', 'dies', 'peter', '82', 'toro', 'picture', 'work'];"
Peter Bogdanovich, the US film director known for films such The Last Picture Show and Paper Moon has died aged 82, his agent confirmed on Thursday.
The New Yorker's work became synonymous with the New Hollywood of the 1970s.
His coming-of-age drama, 1971's The Last Picture Show, which he also co-wrote, earned him eight Oscar nominations including best director.
The film, set in a Texas town, had an ensemble cast of rising stars including Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd.
In 2014, he returned with his first movie in 13 years. She's Funny that Way, starring Owen Wilson and Imogen Poots, was ""a celebration of old Hollywood"", wrote BBC Culture's Nicholas Barber at the time.
Bogdanovich also starred on the small screen, appearing on HBO's The Sopranos where he played the role of a psychotherapist. 
Born in 1939, Bogdanovich became interested in cinema from an early age. 
Between the ages of 12 and 30, he kept a record of every film he watched along with a small review on an index card. 
As a teenager, he attended acting school and upon leaving took up small roles in theatre and on television, the New York Times reports. 
Bogdanovich is survived by his two children.
Francis Ford Coppola, director of The Godfather, released a statement to Deadline to say he was ""devastated"" by the news. 
""May he sleep in bliss for eternity, enjoying the thrill of our applause forever"", he said. 
Guillermo del Toro, the director of Pan's Labyrinth, tweeted: ""He was a dear friend and a champion of Cinema... He single-handedly interviewed and enshrined the lives and work of more classic filmmakers than almost anyone else in his generation.""

153;Ethiopia civil war: Tigray hospital running out of food for starving children;['2022-01-06T14:20:14.000Z'];['By Catherine Byaruhanga'];"[""tigray people's liberation front"", 'tigray crisis', 'ethiopia']";['children', 'region', 'verify', 'report', 'running', 'ethiopia', 'tplf', 'visit', 'war', 'tigray', 'civil', 'liberation', 'starving', 'peoples', 'food', 'journalists', 'unable', 'hospital'];"
Three-month old Surafeal Mearig lies helpless at the biggest hospital in Ethiopia's war-torn region of Tigray. 
His eyes are wide open, and his ribs press against his thin-wrinkled skin. He is among many children suffering from malnutrition because of the 14-month civil war that has also spread to the neighbouring Afar and Amhara regions.
Surafeal's paediatrician at the Ayder Referral Hospital in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, told Reuters news agency that he weighs 2.3kg, one kilogramme less than he did at birth. 
Warning: Some readers may find an image below distressing
According to medical notes published by the hospital's staff, his mother's milk has dried up and his parents, now both unemployed, cannot afford formula milk. 
Crucially, staff at the hospital say they are running out of therapeutic foods to treat children like Surafeal. 
""It is now six months since any supply has come here from Addis Ababa [the federal capital],"" a doctor at the hospital told the BBC on condition of anonymity as he feared his family could be targeted.
""We've almost finished what we had since our last supply arrived in June. Everything is running out,"" he added.
This week medical personnel at Ayder Hospital presented a report to international aid agencies asking for help. 
Surafeal was one of the case studies they referred to. 
The medics said more than 40% of children aged under five years who come to the hospital are malnourished - double the 2019 rate. 
Bone thin, four-year-old Medhaniye also lies in a hospital bed, a feeding tube connected through his nose. 
His medical report says he started suffering from malnutrition after soldiers attacked his family home slaughtering their ox, destroying and looting property. 
The BBC is unable to independently verify the details in the doctors' report as much of Tigray has been under a communications blackout since November 2020 when the conflict broke out between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which is in control of much of the region, and the federal government. Journalists have also not been able to visit Tigray since July.
In their report the doctors blame a six-month ""blockade"" by federal forces and their allies for the severe shortage of medicines and equipment which they say are leading to avoidable deaths. 
""Since the region was besieged, another 35 patients have lost their lives due to dialysis service absence,"" the report says. 
Doctors say they have been forced to stop bleeding with their bare hands, wash and reuse gloves or make their own disinfectant fluids.
In his response, government spokesman Legesse Tulu told the BBC the  report seemed to ""seeking to build a narrative"" for the TPLF and ""mimics"" its claims of a blockade on Tigray. 
""From the government side, there is no deliberate embargo in Tigray that damages our people,"" he said.
But since the war began, aid agencies have complained about not being able to get much aid into Tigray. 
According to the latest report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) on 30 December, aid convoys have not reached Tigray since mid-December because of bureaucratic delays and insecurity. 
The World Food Programme estimates that 100 trucks carrying aid need to reach Tigray each week to meet the needs of more than five million people but according to Ocha only 12% of the supplies needed have made it into the region. 
In response to queries about aid deliveries Mr Legesse said: ""Over 840 of the 1,100 vehicles providing food and medicine to Tigray have yet to be returned. They are suspected of being used by the TPLF to carry illegal recruits, soldiers and military supplies."" 
The TPLF has denied claims it is hampering aid assistance, but its forces have also been accused of looting aid stores and health facilities in areas it occupied in Amhara and Afar. 
The doctor at Ayder Hospital told the BBC that even the families of staff were being affected by the crisis.
""My child has appendicitis and cannot get treatment,"" he said. 
And as the shortages continue he says they will have no choice but to stop all surgery by next week. 
""We don't have supplies. That's the point we've reached now, which is why we wanted to let the world know. Most hospitals are closing.""

154;The companies offering delivery to the Moon;['2022-01-07T00:01:20.000Z'];['By Ben Morris'];['artemis', 'nasa', 'human spaceflight', 'the moon', 'space exploration'];['risky', 'moon', 'quickly', 'delivery', 'slate', 'missions', 'gives', 'fear', 'frees', 'things', 'opportunity', 'offering', 'kind', 'companies'];"
Not many people can say they have a doctorate in interplanetary navigation, but Tim Crain can.
While working on his PhD in Austin, Texas, in the 1990s he hoped one day to work on missions to Mars and in 2000 he landed his dream job with Nasa, at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
""In 2000, the idea was, we would finish the space station in just a matter of years, and then the next big human spaceflight project would be to move on to Mars,"" he says.
But things didn't quite work out that way and shortly after he joined Nasa the agency's priorities changed.
""Things took a turn, we lost [the Space Shuttle] Columbia, had the global war on terrorism, so, Mars fell off the table,"" he explains.
He shifted to another Nasa programme called Constellation, an ambitious plan to return to the Moon and eventually Mars, but by 2010 it too had fallen by the wayside.
""I became a little bit disillusioned that the Moon was no longer an option with Nasa,"" says Mr Crain.
So, after a decade with Nasa he left to form Intuitive Machines with co-founders Steve Altemus and Kam Ghaffarian.
Their plan was to apply their expertise to complicated engineering projects, which they did for a few years.
But in 2018 an opportunity came along that the partners could not resist.
In April of that year Nasa launched Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS), a programme to commission private companies to take cargo to the Moon.
That cargo would include instruments and devices designed to pave the way for Artemis, Nasa's latest plan to return to the Moon, this time by 2025.
""We said: 'Hey, wait a minute. That's something we could go after,'"" remembers Mr Crain.
So, they dropped everything and scrambled to get a proposal together.
""That was a new experience - to write a proposal for a lunar mission of 30 days. And we won, along with two of our competitors Astrobotic and Orbit Beyond and our lives changed,"" he says.
But winning the contract was only the first step, next came the design and development of a spacecraft that could get to the Moon.
""We quickly discovered we needed to assemble a whole programme - we needed operations, we needed launch system integration, we needed an entire payload integration group.
""When you take that whole thing, we actually have a mini space programme,"" says Mr Crain.
Starting with nothing more than a blueprint it took Intuitive Machines three years to build their spacecraft, Nova-C.
Their engineers used knowledge of existing space technology and blended that with their own development.
The company even developed its own propulsion system which uses methane and liquid oxygen, a well-tried combination. 
It is also a fuel that could, one day, be made in space to power future missions.
""Any place there's carbon and water, two of the most abundant chemicals in the universe, as far as we know. We'll be able to make methane.""
""I think that LOX (liquid oxygen) and methane is the propulsion [system] that will drive commerce through the solar system,"" says Mr Crain.
The spacecraft, Nova-C is capable of transporting a payload of 130kg, but for its first flight is only carrying 80kg.
Mr Crain says that once Nova-C has proven itself, they will build bigger spacecraft. The company has plans for one that can carry a payload of five tonnes.
But before those more ambitious missions, the first launch has to go to plan. 
A US spacecraft has not made a soft landing on the Moon since the last of the Apollo missions in 1972. (The LCROSS mission in 2009 deliberately crashed a vehicle into the Moon to examine the material kicked up by the impact.)
Nova-C could change that when it blasts into space atop a SpaceX rocket in the first quarter of 2022.
It will decouple from that rocket after about 18 minutes and head to the Moon on a journey that will take about four days.
More technology of business:
Once there Nova-C will enter a low lunar orbit for around 24 hours. Then it will use its main engine to brake for a soft touchdown between Mare Serenitatis and Mare Crisium, two of the dark lava seas on the Earth-facing side of the Moon. 
Once safely down, it will operate for around 13 and a half days during the lunar day, during which time the Nasa and commercial payloads will be deployed and start work.
The experiments and data gained will be sent back to Earth using Intuitive Machines' own lunar data relay service. 
Once it has run out of energy, everything shuts down and Nova-C will sit on the Moon's surface forever, or perhaps until some future astronaut comes along and recycles it.
One of the biggest engineering challenges has been managing the extreme temperatures that Nova-C will encounter on the Moon, where temperatures can be as high as 140C (284F) and fall to minus 170C (minus 275F).
""If it was just the spacecraft and its flight computers, that would be relatively easy. But now we have to take care of our payloads,"" says Mr Crain.
Heating and cooling systems have been designed to keep the cargo safe, even in the extreme environment of the Moon.
Simeon Barber is a senior research fellow at the Open University and has spent his career developing instruments that will work in space, on planets and other bodies including the moon.
His current project is a Exospheric Mass Spectrometer, which will head into space on the first mission of a rival to Intuitive Machines, Astrobotic. His device will analyse the composition of the lunar atmosphere around the lander.
""I think we are entering a new era, for sure,"" he says.
Previously, scientists like him might have worked on one or possibly two big space missions in their career, but now there are new possibilities with the prospect of more regular trips to the Moon.
""There are several missions on the slate now and this gives you the opportunity to do things quickly, to be a bit more risky, and not have all your eggs in one basket. So it kind of frees you from that fear of failure,"" he says.
Lunar transport systems from Intuitive and its rivals, as well as government-led programmes like Nasa's Artemis will be the start of a new era of human activity on the moon, says Mr Crain.
""Unlike the first time around, where we had to invent a lot of the technology from scratch, we have a lot of technology in terms of electronics, computers, manufacturing, and composite materials [that] has changed the game.""
""I think within the next 20-30 years, you will see civilians paying for for trips to the Moon, for holidays.
""Predicting the future is hard, so maybe not. But I think it's feasible.""
Dr Barber is cautiously optimistic. He highlights how hostile the Moon will be for humans, with the huge temperature range and lunar dust which, if not managed, will damage machinery and human lungs. He is also keen that further human exploration has a minimal environmental impact.
But would he go, if he could?
""I like my home comforts. But yeah. I think you'd have to say, yes wouldn't you?""

155;Kazakhstan unrest: Troops ordered to fire without warning;['2022-01-07T10:11:11.000Z'];['BBC News'];['kazakhstan'];['submit', 'mobile', 'version', 'question', 'ordered', 'unrest', 'reading', 'visit', 'website', 'need', 'kazakhstan', 'submission', 'page', 'troops', 'warning'];"

Kazakhstan's authoritarian leader says he has ordered security forces to ""fire without warning"", amid a violent crackdown on anti-government protests.
President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev also said ""20,000 bandits"" had attacked the main city of Almaty, the epicentre of protests sparked by a fuel price hike.
He has blamed foreign-trained ""terrorists"", without giving evidence.
The interior ministry says 26 ""armed criminals"" and 18 security officers have been killed so far in the unrest. 
In a televised address, Mr Tokayev dismissed calls to hold talks with protesters as ""nonsense"", saying: ""What kind of talks can we hold with criminals and murderers?""
""We had to deal with armed and well-prepared bandits, local as well as foreign. More precisely, with terrorists. So we have to destroy them, this will be done soon,"" he said. 
Opposition groups have rejected the authorities' accusations of terrorism.
Where is it? Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe.
Why does it matter? A former Soviet republic which is mainly Muslim with a large Russian minority, it has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors.  
Why is it making the news? Fuel riots, which have escalated to become broader protests against the government, have resulted in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters.
President Tokayev said peacekeeping forces sent from Russia and neighbouring states had arrived on his request and were in the country on a temporary basis to ensure security.
The force from the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) reportedly has about 2,500 soldiers. Mr Tokayev gave ""special thanks"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin for sending troops to the former Soviet nation.
Earlier, the president said constitutional order had been largely restored although gunfire was heard near the main square of Almaty.
Internet connection seems to have been restored in some areas, and Kazakh officials and CSTO troops were controlling Almaty's main airport, a day after it was recaptured from protesters.         
The unrest began on Sunday when the cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - which many people in Kazakhstan use to fuel their cars - doubled.
The government has said that fuel price caps will be restored for six months. But the announcement has failed to end the protests, which have broadened to include other political grievances.
Kazakhstan is often described as authoritarian, and most elections are won by the ruling party with nearly 100% of the vote. There is no effective political opposition.

158;Census 1921 - 100-year-old secrets revealed;['2022-01-06T06:00:53.000Z'];['By Sanchia Berg'];['history'];['100yearold', 'season', 'probably', 'revealed', 'staff', 'likely', 'given', 'secrets', 'large', 'social', 'london', '1921', 'homes', 'census', 'lady'];"
A unique snapshot of life one midsummer night - just over 100 years ago - reveals, among other things, life in the real Downton Abbey, how slum families pleaded for better homes, and why a man from Yorkshire wasn't able to divorce his wife.
Pages from the 1921 Census - made available for the first time - reveal glimpses of some of the lives of the 38 million people living in England and Wales on the evening of 19 June that year. At the time, the country was recovering from the shocks of World War One and the Spanish flu pandemic.
The future crime writer Dorothy L Sayers was living in central London and working from home in June 1921, when the census was carried out. She was a boarder in the Bloomsbury home of Elinor James, an Irishwoman of 57 who - like her five female tenants - was single. 
Almost all boarding-house keepers were women in 1921, the census shows. 
Elinor James's house, in Mecklenburgh Square, had eight rooms - generous compared with many other homes. Her lodgers were aged between 25 and 32 - among the 1.7 million so-called ""surplus women"" who supposedly found it hard to find a husband. So many men of their age had been killed in World War One. 
Many of those young women entered the workplace instead. The census shows more were working in professions. Most were teachers and nurses, but more were training to become lawyers, architects and doctors.
At Mecklenburgh Square, all five boarders worked. 
Dorothy L Sayers had studied modern languages at Oxford and described herself on the form as a translator. Her first detective novel ""Whose Body?"" would be published two years later, introducing the amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey.
The youngest tenant, Kitty Wood, worked as a solicitor's clerk in Lincoln's Inn. The eldest, Edith - whose surname is hard to make out - was a librarian at the Daily News. 
Ursula Murphy, from Dublin, worked as a temporary civil servant in the Foreign Office. Alice Saxty - from Queensland, Australia - described herself, apparently with some pride, as a ""craft worker"" who made dresses for ""Dora McLaren artist"". Dora McLaren had designed posters for the London Underground, and in the 1920s illustrated a comic strip for the Daily Herald newspaper.
For the first time, the 1921 Census allowed respondents to identify themselves as being divorced. Just 16,000 people did so. 
It would be another 50 years before a marriage could end with neither party at ""fault"" - and so the shame of getting a divorce, plus the cost of legal proceedings, meant formal separation from a partner was not an option for many.
In 1921, there were many single mothers - but relatively few from divorce. Almost all were as a result of World War One. The number of widows rose sharply - from 642,311 in 1911 to more than 1.6m at the start of the 1920s.
Yorkshireman William Ambler, a Bradford factory worker, wrote on his form that he was married - but hadn't lived with his wife for 20 years. He explained how she had been unfaithful to him and had given birth to a daughter.  
Mr Ambler said he could not afford to divorce his wife, although she had successfully applied to the court for maintenance which he had to pay. 
""Is it not high time there was [sic] divorce laws to dissolve such unions,"" he wrote. 
""Have I to serve life-long misery, for her infidelity?"" he asked.
Edith White, a housekeeper from West Yorkshire, living with her grown-up son and daughter, scrawled ""We favour divorce law reform"" across her form. 
But for others, ending a marriage was just plain wrong. Henry Forrest of Stretford Road in Manchester stated his objection to even asking a divorce question on the census form. 
Divorce was a ""CURSE to the country"" wrote the school teacher - who was 42, unmarried, and living with his five younger sisters and brother.
On the evening of the census, the Earl of Carnarvon was at home in Highclere Castle - familiar today to millions as the fictional Downton Abbey. 
Joining him upstairs was his wife, their 19-year-old daughter Lady Evelyn Herbert, the archaeologist Howard Carter and a female visitor. 
Downstairs that evening were four members of staff. 
Cook Minnie Lynch, 42, was originally from Killarney in Ireland.  Ivy Cestell, 20, from County Cork, and Isabelle Fowler Reed, 18, from Aberdeen, were both kitchen maids. Thirty-year-old Louise Villepinte, from France, was a ladies' maid. Only Ivy was married - the others listed themselves as single.
Highclere is a grand stately home with 35 principal bedrooms and - just like in ITV's Downton Abbey - employed many servants. The 1911 census recorded 18 resident staff including 10 maids. So why were there so few in 1921? 
The most likely explanation - according to the current Lady Carnarvon - is that it was the London ""season"" and many aristocrats from large country homes would have been enjoying social events in and around the capital. Some of the staff were probably there too - while others might have been given time off.
Lady Carnarvon says the then Earl, his wife and daughter, could have made a special trip back to Highclere from London to meet Howard Carter. The Earl funded the archaeologist's journeys to Egypt in winter, and In late 1922, they would discover Tutankhamun's tomb.
There were 1,712 Jamaican-born people living in England and Wales in 1921 - according to the census.
Dr Harold Moody was one of the most prominent. He had finished at the top of his class studying medicine at King's College London.
His census return shows him living on King's Road (now King's Grove) in Peckham, south-east London, in a 10-room house. He was then 38 - and his wife, Olive, who'd been born in Henley, was 32. The couple had five young children.
Also living with them was a ""general domestic"" servant - a 17-year-old girl called Frances Hinds, who had been born in Hampstead.
Moody described himself as a ""medical practitioner"" working from home. He had set up his own practice in 1913 after struggling to find employment.
In 1931, he established the League of Coloured Peoples to campaign for black rights in the UK.  
James Bartley was 33 in the summer of 1921. He worked as a gas fitter and lived in Montgomery Street in Hove, Sussex, with his wife May and three children under five.
Two-bedroom houses in that road now sell for about half a million pounds - but 100 years ago, the Bartley family lived in one room.
""Stop talking about your homes for heroes,"" wrote Mr Bartley at the bottom of his form. ""Start building some houses and let them at a rent a working man can afford to pay.""
""Homes Fit for Heroes"" had been the promise made by Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George, two years before at the end of the Great War. He had pledged to build half a million new homes for returning veterans.
Across the country, most tenants lived in privately-rented housing, often in squalid conditions.
Mr Bartley would most likely have fought in the war himself - but while the National Archives holds medal cards for several James Bartleys, none are from local Sussex Regiments and no dates of birth are listed.
At least Bartley was employed - he worked for the Brighton Gas Company. Two hundred miles away near Liverpool, ""master tailor"" Robert Stevens - a father of 13 - stated he was ""out of work"".
Mr Stevens, 44, and his wife Agnes - who according to their form was busy with ""Home Duties"" - lived with their children in five rooms on Park Street, Wallasey.
Ivy, 21, and Gerty, 19, were both milliners. The eldest boy, 18-year-old Robert, worked at St Paul's Mills in Birkenhead. Florrie,16, and Bella, 14, helped their mother at home. Five younger children were at school, and the youngest three were at home. 
Robert Stevens wrote simply: ""Can you help us times are hard.""
There was no category for disability on the census forms, but some householders chose to note their own conditions anyway - including former soldiers still struggling three years after their return from war.
Harold Samuel Orpen of St Mary's Mansions, in Paddington central London, was nearly 47 and a retired regular Army officer. He lived in six rooms with his wife Joan and a 20-year-old servant, Florence Wiles, originally from Norfolk. 
Orpen's form is noticeable for its lack of fountain-pen ink. Instead, he used a typewriter to fill it out and felt obliged to explain: ""I lost half my right hand in the late war and cannot write properly.""
Other former service personnel added handwritten notes. One simply wrote: ""Ruined by War doing odd work"" in the section for occupation. 
The giant information-gathering task was supposed to have taken place in April 1921 rather than June, but was delayed because of industrial unrest. The original April date on the forms was never changed.
Census staff, 38,000 of them, hand-delivered the papers to eight and a half million households - returning later to collect them. The enumerators, as they were called, told newspapers it was a ""wearying job"". One complained that children had used the forms to play noughts and crosses.
""You walk from house to house trying to look pleasant and important, and doing your best to make believe you're loving the job, while all the time you feel you would welcome the Earth to open and swallow you up,"" said another.
Nevertheless, a century on, their determined efforts are being revealed in a unique and valuable resource. It's accessible either for free in person at the National Archives in west London, Manchester Central Library or National Library of Wales - or for a fee through the Findmypast website.

159;'Crisis actor' conspiracy theory: How anti-vax activists targeted a Covid patient;['2022-01-07T03:31:59.000Z'];['By Marianna Spring'];['anti-vaccination movement', 'fake news'];['actor', 'patient', 'crisis', 'tells', 'covid', 'targeted', 'antivax', 'value', 'conspiracy', 'mr', 'sarcastically', 'taken', 'social', 'theory', 'unfortunate', 'activists', 'wrote', 'dyne', 'taylor'];"
A man was targeted with hundreds of abusive messages after being featured in a year-end BBC News report. The source? Anti-vaccine activists who falsely believed he was a so-called ""crisis actor"" pretending to be sick with Covid-19.
A few days after Christmas, Henry Dyne nonchalantly checked his phone while ordering a couple of drinks at a bar. As he unlocked it, he was greeted by more than 600 notifications. 
He began to despair - it was something he'd experienced before - but, says the 29-year-old from Surrey, this time was ""a hundred times worse"".
The messages were nasty, abusive, even threatening.
""Next time you're in a hospital bed,"" one read, ""it won't be with Corona.""  
Dyne's misfortune began when he contracted the virus in summer 2021. He hadn't been vaccinated, he said, thinking that his relative youth would make any infection pretty mild. 
But the IT consultant - who also enjoys posting jokes on his Instagram account - was unlucky.
""Every time I'd sleep, I'm not sleeping. I'm all over the place. And then one day, I just woke up at about six in the morning and said I'm calling an ambulance,"" he says. ""The scariest part was the fever and the hallucinations.""
In July, he ended up in hospital, hooked up to an oxygen tank, and spoke to BBC journalists who were visiting to report on a rise in Covid cases in young people for the News at Six.
""I just thought it probably would be quite good to go on record and say 'this is my experience, it is a lot worse than I thought, so get the vaccine',"" he says. 
He didn't think he'd soon find himself the focus of a group of anti-vaccine activists. It was the start of allegations that he was a so-called ""crisis actor"". 
The idea of ""crisis actors"" - people who pretend or are hired to act out some particular tragedy or disaster - is part of many contemporary conspiracy theories. 
The concept was notoriously used to allege that parents of dead children in the Sandy Hook shooting were somehow faking their personal tragedies. The idea allows motivated activists to explain away real suffering by pretending it was somehow staged.
Of course, BBC News does not use ""crisis actors"", and does not pay interviewees. Dyne was not paid for his contribution. 
But that did not stop committed anti-vaccine activists from making up false information and going on the attack. 
""How much did the BBC pay you to pretend you had Covid-19?"" one message read. Another said: ""You're a dirtbag, mate. Karma is real my friend.""
There were much worse comments as well - many too explicit to share here.
Wild theories spiralled further out of control as activists trawled through his online accounts. Some discovered his LinkedIn profile, which listed one of his former employers, a company that had secured government contracts providing laptops to schools during the pandemic.
The detail was true, but he was no longer employed by the company - the connection was both tenuous and coincidental. 
After the initial wave of abuse tailed off and Dyne was on the road to making a full recovery, he tried to joke about it on his Instagram bio, sarcastically describing himself as a ""1x Academy Award Winning Crisis Actor"".
""Humour is my way of coping, all you can do is laugh,"" he explains, ""Little did I know this joke would get me in so much trouble.""
Round two came after a BBC News Special broadcast on 27 December, called Review 2021: The Coronavirus Pandemic. It included the clip of Dyne's original interview. 
Someone posted a video of themselves watching the special, googling Henry Dyne's name, finding his Instagram bio and reading the phrase ""crisis actor"".
It's unclear who made the original video - but it was quickly reposted in anti-vaccine circles on YouTube and Facebook, before really taking off on Twitter. 
One of the main drivers of the Twitter storm was an aspiring Welsh politician, Richard Taylor. He posted the video on Facebook and racked up thousands of reactions with a tweet. 
Taylor received 20% of the vote in Blaenau Gwent standing for the Brexit Party in the 2019 General Election. He recently set up a crowdfunding campaign that raised £61,000 for a Swansea cinema closed after breaching Covid regulations.  
Taylor's posts read ""We see you"" along with the video, but when contacted said via email: ""In my original post, I was not implying anything... It us up to my social media followers to draw a conclusion from what they see or read.
""It is unfortunate that Mr Dyne decided to reference himself sarcastically in his social media accounts,"" Taylor wrote, ""I have lived believing that when someone tells you who or what they are, believe them, so I would have taken Mr Dyne at face value when he referenced himself as a crisis actor.""
He also condemned the abuse and threats. 
""I would never intentionally contribute to abusing or threatening another individual, having spent a large part of my vocation life helping and serving others,"" he wrote. 
But the viral video did result in Dyne receiving hundreds more abusive and threatening messages - he estimates three times as many as in the initial wave in July, including several death threats and fake accounts set up in his name.
Taylor's post on Facebook was labelled as false by fact-checkers. A video on YouTube remains live, as do several viral tweets showing the video on Twitter. 
Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook - has since taken down the fake accounts. 
""We apologise to Henry for the distress that this must have caused,"" a Meta statement said. 
""Accounts that impersonate someone else are not allowed on Instagram and we have removed the accounts reported to us.""
Twitter said in a statement: ""We continue to take enforcement action on content and accounts that advance demonstrably false or misleading claims about Covid-19 and that may lead to significant risk of harm.""
YouTube is investigating the video in question. 
All three social media companies condemned online harassment and say they have rules and tools to protect against it. 
While lamenting the repeated rounds of abuse, Henry Dyne has continued to poke fun at his accusers, joking that he's available to ""fake"" other disasters.
""That's literally all you can do,"" he says. ""Something does need to happen with social media. It's just so obvious that it's blown so far out of control.""
While he would consider a career in stand-up comedy, he says his bout with Covid-19 wasn't very funny - and was all too real.

160;Obituary: Iconic black actor Sidney Poitier;['2022-01-07T15:35:51.000Z'];['BBC News'];['obituaries'];['way', 'film', 'actor', 'doctor', 'iconic', 'patient', 'newlyqualified', 'obituary', 'sidney', 'studios', 'black', 'played', 'performance', 'poitier', 'sound', 'racist'];"
Sidney Poitier, who has died aged 94, once turned down the role of Othello because he did not want to be typecast as a black actor.
It underlined the dilemma faced by a man who broke down many of Hollywood's racial barriers.
As the first black winner of the Academy Awards' Best Actor statuette, he was always aware of being the standard-bearer for greater racial integration.
But often he felt he had become something of a racial token, and this denied him the opportunity of taking on more varied roles.
He died on Friday, aged 94, the Bahamian foreign minister announced.  
Sidney Poitier was born on 20 February 1927 in Miami, Florida.
His parents were Bahamian farmers who had travelled to the US to sell tomatoes. His premature birth meant he gained US citizenship as well as Bahamian.
Relatives believed his father's family originated in Haiti and that his ancestors were runaway slaves. 
He was brought up on Cat Island in the Bahamas before the family moved to the capital, Nassau.
Aged 15 he went to live with his brother in Miami before moving to New York, where he worked as a dishwasher.
It was in the US that he experienced racism for the first time.
""I lived in a country where I couldn't get a job, except those put aside for my colour or my caste.""
After a spell in the US Army he joined the American Negro Theatre, which had been set up as a community project in Harlem in 1940.
Unfortunately Poitier was tone-deaf and was unable to sing, something audiences felt was a prerequisite of black actors at that time.
Instead he decided his future lay as a serious stage actor and he was offered a leading role in a production of Aristophanes' comedy Lysistrata in 1946. 
It was a sign of the times that the production featured only black actors. 
In 1949 he took the difficult decision to move away from stage productions and into films.
It was a sound decision. His performance in the 1950 film No Way Out, in which he played a newly-qualified doctor confronted by a racist patient, brought him to the attention of the studios.
His breakthrough came in The Blackboard Jungle in 1955, in the role of a disruptive pupil in an inner-city school. 
The film was immensely popular, not least because it was one of the first to have a soundtrack featuring rock 'n' roll, including Bill Haley's classic Rock Around the Clock.
The Defiant Ones, in 1958, saw Poitier nominated for best actor at the Academy Awards, and he won a Bafta for the same film.
Five years later he was awarded an Oscar for Lilies of the Field, the first black winner of the Best Actor trophy.
With the growing civil rights movement in the US, it was inevitable Poitier would find himself lauded as an example of black achievement. It was a role he gladly accepted.
""I was a pretty good actor and I believed in brotherhood. I hated racism and segregation. And I was a symbol against those things.""
However, he was concerned that his Oscar may have been indicative of Hollywood's need for a token black actor, rather than something he achieved on merit.
Then 1967 saw him at his commercial peak with three films, making him Hollywood's most bankable star that year.
He played a newly-qualified teacher in a tough London school in To Sir, With Love, based on the autobiographical novel by E R Braithwaite.
His character's experience of being an immigrant in London mirrored that of many West Indians who came to Britain during the 1950s and '60s.
""Acting isn't a game of 'pretend',"" he once said. ""It's an exercise in being real.""
Poitier was nominated for Bafta and Golden Globe awards for Norman Jewison's film In the Heat of the Night.
He played a Philadelphia detective who found himself stranded in a red-necked Mississippi town on the night a businessman is murdered.
His developing relationship with the bigoted local sheriff, played by Rod Steiger, gave Poitier his strongest role and the film won five Oscars, including best picture.
Poitier's response to Steiger's question ""What do they call you, boy?"" produced one of cinema's most famous lines: ""They call me Mr Tibbs.""
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner featured Poitier as the boyfriend of a white, middle-class girl who takes him to meet her parents.
Played by Spencer Tracey and Katherine Hepburn, her parents were torn between their liberal values and their reaction to a prospective black son-in-law.
At the time filming began, interracial marriage was still illegal in 17 US states. These laws were only revoked by the Supreme Court months before the film was released.
But Poitier faced criticism from some black civil-rights activists who complained his characters were just too good to be true.
It helped to persuade him to move away from acting roles. He involved himself in the campaign for Bahamian independence, achieved in 1973, and began a new career as a director.
By the end of the 1970s, Poitier had formed his own production company with other stars, including Paul Newman and Barbra Streisand.
Successes behind the camera included Stir Crazy, with Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, and the thrillers Shoot to Kill and Little Nikita.
Poitier became the first black actor to receive a life achievement award from the American Film Institute in 1992.
Five years later, he was appointed the Bahamas' ambassador to Japan and he received a knighthood in 1974. 
As a Bahamian citizen this was a substantive rather than an honorary award, although he did not use it in the US.
Poitier married  Juanita Hardy in 1950, but the union ended in 1965. In 1976 he married the Canadian actress, Joanna Shimkus, and had six daughters from his two marriages. His daughter, Sydney Tamiia Poitier is also an actress.
In 2016 He was awarded a Fellowship by Bafta, a recognition of his outstanding contribution to cinema. Poor health prevented him travelling to London to receive the award so he appeared via a video link.
Poitier's noted ability to play intelligent leading roles helped to break down racial taboos in American cinema and wider society, although he played down his importance as a role model.
""If I'm remembered for having done a few good things,"" he once said, ""and if my presence here has sparked some good energies, that's plenty.""

162;Texas teacher 'locked Covid-positive son in car boot';['2022-01-08T03:45:27.000Z'];['BBC News'];['coronavirus testing', 'texas', 'united states', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['car', 'taking', 'locked', 'test', 'covidpositive', 'positive', 'texas', 'son', 'teacher', 'result', 'media', 'pridgeon', 'tested', 'stadium', 'boot', 'ms'];"
A US teacher has been arrested after allegedly locking her Covid-positive son in a car boot to protect herself from exposure to the virus as she drove to a testing site, say local media.
Sarah Beam, 41, is reportedly charged with endangering a child.
A witness called police after hearing someone in the vehicle's trunk on 3 January at the site in Harris County, Texas, according to click2Houston.com. 
The teacher reportedly opened the boot to reveal the boy lying inside.
Ms Beam said her 13-year-old son had tested positive for Covid-19 and she was taking him to the Pridgeon Stadium location for another test to confirm the result, according to local media.
She reportedly said she had placed the teenager in the car boot because she did not want to be infected herself.
A health worker told her there would be no coronavirus test until the boy was allowed to sit in the back seat of the car, reports ABC affiliate KTRK-TV.
Ms Beam has been working as a teacher at Cypress Falls High School since 2011, but is now on administrative leave, according to local media.
Cy-Fair ISD Police Department said: ""CFPD was alerted that a child was in the trunk of a car at a drive-thru Covid-19 testing site earlier this week.
""Law enforcement conducted a full investigation, resulting in a warrant for arrest. Thankfully, the child was not harmed.""
Sgt Richard Standifer, of the Texas Department of Public Safety, told local TV station KHOU 11 that the boy could have been seriously hurt if the vehicle had ended up in a collision.
""I have never heard of somebody being put in a trunk because they tested positive for anything,"" said Sgt Standifer.

At least 21 people have died after heavy snow trapped them in their vehicles in northern Pakistan.
The military is attempting clear roads and rescue people still trapped near the hilltop town of Murree. 
Around 1,000 vehicles were trapped on a highway during a blizzard, according to Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid. 
Murree is a mountain resort town north of the capital Islamabad. Local media reported on Friday that tourists were getting stranded due to snow.
More than 100,000 cars had entered Murree in recent days to see the unusually heavy snowfall. This caused a huge traffic jam on roads leading in and out of the town, police told the AFP news agency. 
The area has now been declared a ""disaster area"", Punjab province chief minister's office said, urging people to stay away.

Turkmenistan's president has ordered the extinguishing of the country's ""Gateway to Hell"", a fire that has been burning for decades in a huge desert gas crater.
Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov wants it put out for environmental and health reasons, as well as part of efforts to increase gas exports. 
Mystery surrounds the Darvaza crater's creation in the Karakum Desert.
Many believe it formed when a Soviet drilling operation went wrong in 1971.
But Canadian explorer George Kourounis examined the crater's depths in 2013 and discovered that no-one actually knows how it started. 
According to local Turkmen geologists, the huge crater formed in the 1960s but was only lit in the 1980s. 
The crater is one of Turkmenistan's most popular tourist attractions.  
""We are losing valuable natural resources for which we could get significant profits and use them for improving the well-being of our people,"" the president said in televised remarks. 
He instructed officials to ""find a solution to extinguish the fire"".
There have been numerous attempts to end the fire, including in 2010 when Mr Berdymukhamedov also ordered experts to find a way to put out the flames.
In 2018, the president officially renamed it the Shining of Karakum.

166;Marilyn Bergman: Oscar-winning lyricist dies at 93;['2022-01-08T19:25:19.000Z'];['BBC News'];['music'];['marilyn', 'pictwittercom2y7v76w4jj', 'human', 'nadia', 'dear', 'lose', 'bergman', 'oscarwinning', 'dies', 'sidney', 'morning', 'lyricist', 'epitome', '93', 'crushing'];"
Marilyn Bergman, the Oscar winning lyricist who collaborated with her husband Alan on The Way We Were and hundreds more songs, has died aged 93.
The song-writing duo worked together on numerous shows for stage and screen and were known as ballad specialists. 
They wrote hits for Hollywood stars including Barbra Streisand, Fred Astaire and Frank Sinatra.
She died on Saturday at her Los Angeles home with Alan and her daughter by her side, her agent said.
Bergman's cause of death has been reported as respiratory failure, and is not Covid related. She is survived by her husband, 96.
The Bergmans were nominated for 16 Academy Award nominations, winning three times - for The Way We Were from the 1973 Barbra Streisand film of that name, Windmills of Your Mind from The Thomas Crown Affair in 1968 and for their score for Streisand's Yentl in 1983.
They also won several Grammy and Emmy awards, and were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1980.
Bergman was a trailblazer for women in the industry and in 1985 was the first woman to be elected president and chairman of the board of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP).
Among those paying tribute was US producer Quincy Jones, who called her death ""crushing"".
Born in Brooklyn, New York City on 10 November 1928 in the same hospital as her husband, Bergman studied music from a young age. 
While at New York's High School of Music & Art, she often played piano for lyricist Bob Russell, who encouraged her to consider becoming a professional songwriter.
But her entry into writing lyrics was also a painful one - while in college, Bergman fell down a flight of stairs and broke both of her shoulders. Unable to write or play piano, she started speaking song lyrics into a tape recorder.
Even though she and Alan grew up living close to each other, they did not meet until they both moved to Los Angeles. For Bergman, that was in the mid-1950s, and she started writing lyrics for composer Lew Spence, with whom Alan was also working with. 
Marilyn and Alan wed two years later in 1958. They had one daughter together, Julie Bergman Sender, who is a film producer.

A Saudi princess and her daughter have been released from a high-security jail after being held for nearly three years without charge, campaigners say. 
Princess Basma bint Saud was detained in March 2019 as she prepared to fly to Switzerland for medical treatment.
It is not known why she was detained, and neither she nor her daughter Suhoud were charged with any crime.
Some have speculated it may have been related to her advocacy on humanitarian issues and constitutional reform.
Her family told the United Nations in a written statement in 2020 that it was likely due in large part to her ""record as an outspoken critic of abuses"", news agency AFP reports.
Other supporters suggest it was her close links to former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who is reported to have been placed under house arrest.
Princess Basma, 57, appealed to Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to release her last April, saying she had done nothing wrong and that her health was suffering.
It is not known what treatment she was seeking abroad when she was detained in 2019.
Announcing her released on Twitter, the ALQST for Human Rights said she had been ""denied the medical care she needed for a potentially life threatening condition"" during her time in the Al-Ha'ir prison, on the outskirts of the capital.
The Saudi rights group added. ""At no point during her detention has any charge been levelled against her."" 
Princess Basma is the youngest daughter of King Saud, who ruled Saudi Arabia between 1953 and 1964.

At least five people have been killed after part of a cliff collapsed onto leisure boats on a Brazilian lake.
Another 20 are missing and 32 injured following the accident in the south-east of the country.
Video circulating online shows the moment the rock detaches from the cliff face as onlookers try to yell warnings to the boats beneath.
At least one of the boats appears to have sunk, while others managed to escape.
The collapse at 11:00 local time (14:00 GMT) followed days of rain in Minas Gerais state, which had made the cliffs more susceptible to collapse, local fire officials told reporters.
Three vessels were hit by falling rock, Lieutenant Pedro Aihara told reporters. Out of the 32 injured, one person was in hospital with serious head and facial injuries, while 23 escaped with only light injuries.
Divers and helicopters are searching the water for any more survivors.

171;Nigeria attacks: Hundreds reported killed as bandits target villages;['2022-01-09T05:37:21.000Z'];['BBC News'];['africa today podcasts'];['let', 'communities', 'mr', 'reported', 'villages', 'attacks', 'determined', 'rid', 'reassure', 'nigerians', 'outlaws', 'killed', 'buhari', 'target', 'nigeria', 'bandits', 'fate', 'hundreds'];"
At least 200 people in Nigeria's north-western Zamfara state have been killed in a wave of vicious attacks by armed militants, residents say. 
The attacks are believed to be in response to military air strikes that killed more than 100 fighters on Monday and forced others from forest hideouts.
Gunmen burnt homes and mutilated the bodies of their victims in the assault. 
A resident of one of the villages told the Reuters news agency the militants were shooting ""anyone on sight"".
The attacks are the latest in a wave of violent attacks in north-west Nigeria, where the central government has long been at war with a number of local criminal groups it has described as bandits. 
These gangs are sophisticated networks of criminals who operate across large swathes of territory, often stealing animals, kidnapping for ransom and killing those who confront them.
On Friday it was initially reported that more than 100 people had been killed by suspected ""bandit"" militants in the region, after some 300 gunmen on motorbikes arrived in as many as nine communities between Tuesday and Thursday night. 
Idi Musa, a resident of another village, told the AFP news agency that the attackers also stole ""around 2,000 cattle"". 
Meanwhile, local media has reported that armed groups appear to be abandoning hideouts in forested areas in response to sustained government attacks, instead moving towards the western part of Zamfara state. 
In a statement issued on Saturday, Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari pledged that the government would not relent in its battle with the militants. 
""Let me reassure these besieged communities and other Nigerians that this government will not abandon them to their fate because we are more than ever determined to get rid of these outlaws,"" Mr Buhari said. 
""The latest attacks on innocent people by the bandits is an act of desperation by mass murderers, now under relentless pressure from our military forces.""
On Wednesday, the Nigerian government officially labelled bandits as terrorists, allowing security forces to impose tougher sanctions on the groups and their supporters. 
Nigeria's armed forces said this week they had killed 537 ""armed bandits and other criminal elements"" in the region and arrested 374 others since May last year.
Thousands of Nigerian troops have been deployed to fight them.

174;Air pollution: Delhi's smog problem is rooted in India's water crisis;['2022-01-10T00:03:39.000Z'];['BBC News'];['asia', 'delhi', 'india', 'air pollution'];['raising', 'water', 'winter', 'winds', 'rains', 'shrinks', 'popular', 'problem', 'indias', 'crisis', 'vertically', 'sources', 'air', 'northwest', 'smog', 'rooted', 'delhis', 'pollution'];"
Every winter, Indian capital Delhi's toxic air is fuelled by farmers burning crop stubble. But the fires don't stop. Why? The answer lies in water, writes climate expert Mridula Ramesh.
India loses an estimated $95bn (£70bn) to air pollution every year. 
From mid-March to mid-October, when Delhi's air quality varies from good to moderate to unhealthy for sensitive groups, chatter on air pollution and its causes is muted. 
But then comes winter. Pollution in any city mixes vertically in the atmosphere, and the height at which this happens shrinks by more than half in the winter, raising the concentration of pollution. Two new sources also enter the mix. By the end of October, when the rains have ceased, the winds begin to blow in from the northwest, carrying fumes from burning fields. Then there is the Diwali, the popular festival lights, where millions burst fire crackers to celebrate. 
Both of these play a large role in the spike in pollution. In the first week of November 2021, when Delhi's air quality went beyond hazardous, stubble burning accounted for 42% of the city's PM2.5 levels - these are tiny particles that can enter the lungs. 
Governments have banned the practice, imposed fines and even suggested alternate uses for the straw and other crop residue. But farmers continue to burn stubble. Why? 
Think of the fields that are on fire. They get only between 500-700mm (19-27 in) of rainfall a year. Yet, many of these fields grow a dual crop of paddy and wheat. Paddy alone needs about 1,240mm (48.8 in) of rainfall each year, and so, farmers use groundwater to bridge the gap. 
The northern states of Punjab and Haryana, which grow large amounts of paddy, together take out roughly 48 billion cubic metres (bcm) of groundwater a year, which is not much less than India's overall annual municipal water requirement: 56bcm. As a result, groundwater levels in these states are dropping rapidly. Punjab is expected to run out of groundwater in 20-25 years from 2019, according to an official estimate. 
The burning fields is a symptom of the deteriorating relationship between India and its water. 
Long ago, farmers grew crops based on locally available water. Tanks, inundation canals and forests helped smoothen the inherent variability of India's tempestuous water. 
But in the late 19th Century, the land began to transform as the British wanted to secure India's north-western frontier against possible Russian incursion. They built canals connecting the rivers of Punjab, bringing water to a dry land. They cut down forests, feeding the wood to railways that could cart produce from the freshly watered fields. And they imposed a fixed tax payable in cash that made farmers eager to grow crops that could be sold easily. These changes made farmers believe that water could be shaped, irrespective of local sources - a crucial change in thinking that is biting us today.
After independence from the British in 1947, repeated droughts made the Indian government succumb to the lure of the ""green revolution"". 
Until then, rice, a water-hungry crop, was a marginal crop in Punjab. It was grown on less than 7% of the fields. But beginning in the early 1960s, paddy cultivation was encouraged by showing farmers how to cheaply and conveniently tap into a new, seemingly-endless source of water that lay underground. 
The flat power tariffs to run borewells were cheapened and finally not paid - removing any incentive to conserve water. Water did not need to be managed, farmers were taught, only extracted. In the heady first years of the revolution, fields began to churn out paddy and wheat, and India became food-secure. But after a couple of decades, the water began to sputter.
To conserve groundwater, a 2009 law forbade farmers from sowing and transplanting paddy before a pre-determined date based on the onset of the monsoon. The aim was to make the borewells run less in the peak summer months. 
But the delay in paddy planting shrunk the gap between the paddy harvest and sowing of wheat. And the quickest way to clear the fields was to burn them, giving rise to the smoky plumes that add to northern India's air pollution.
So, the toxic smog is but a visible symbol of India's trainwreck of a relationship with its water. 
To tackle this problem, Indians need to respect their water again - a tall ask after decades of neglect. 
Take people's choices in food and crops. A century ago, most Indians ate the hardy millet, which could withstand the vicissitudes of India's water. Today, there are far more Indians, and they eat rice and wheat rotis (flatbreads), making millets an unappealing crop for farmers to grow. 
And pricing water, directly or through electricity that powers the borewells, is seen as political suicide. Meanwhile, as air quality improves from hazardous to (very) unhealthy, people, courts and political leaders have moved on - at least until next November. 
But the time bomb - of depleting groundwater - ticks on. Once that runs out, the November air might be cleaner.
But what will India do about food?

175;The AI software that could turn you in to a music star;['2022-01-10T00:03:28.000Z'];['By Padraig Belton'];['streaming', 'artificial intelligence', 'music'];['ai', 'solve', 'software', 'solutions', 'opera', 'natural', 'star', 'valley', 'tech', 'music', 'silicon', 'wider', 'problems', 'technology', 'turn'];"
If you have ever dreamed of earning money from a stellar music career but were concerned you had little talent, don't let that put you off  - a man called Alex Mitchell might be able to help.
Mr Mitchell is the founder and boss of a website and app called Boomy, which helps its users create their own songs using artificial intelligence (AI) software that does most of the heavy lifting.
You choose from a number of genres, click on ""create song"", and the AI will compose one for you in less than 30 seconds. It swiftly picks the track's key, chords and melody. And from there you can then finesse your song. 
You can do things such as add or strip-out instruments, change the tempo, adjust the volumes, add echoes, make everything sound brighter or softer, and lay down some vocals.
California-based, Boomy, was launched at the end of 2018, and claims its users around the world have now created almost five million songs.
The Boomy website and app even allows people to submit their tracks to be listed on Spotify and other music streaming sites, and to earn money every time they get played.
While Boomy owns the copyright to each recording, and receives the funds in the first instance, the company says it passes on 80% of the streaming royalties to the person who created the song.
Mr Mitchell adds that more than 10,000 of its users have published over 100,000 songs in total on various streaming services.
""Eighty-five per cent of our users have never made music before,"" Mr Mitchell tells the BBC. ""And now we've got people who were paying their rent, and augmenting their income, with $100 (£74) or $200 a month from Boomy during Covid.""
But, how good are these Boomy created songs? It has to be said that they do sound very computer generated. You wouldn't mistake them for a group of people making music using real instruments.
However, using AI to help compose music isn't exactly new: US classical composer, David Cope, developed such a software system back in the 1980s, following some episodes of writer's block.
One day he set it up to write compositions similar to those by Johann Sebastian Bach. Mr Cope then popped out for a sandwich, and returned to find that the computer had composed 5,000 Bach-inspired chorales. These were later released on an album called Bach by Design.
More recently, in 2019, Berlin-based US electronic music composer, Holly Herndon, made an album called Proto in collaboration with an AI system called Spawn that she had co-created. Ms Herndon is an expert in this field, and has a doctorate in music and computing from Stanford University in the US. 
Mr Mitchell says that what has changed in recent years is that technological advancements in AI have meant song-writing software has become much cheaper.
So much so that Boomy is able to offer its basic membership package for free. Other AI song creator apps, such as Audoir's SAM, and Melobytes, are also free to use.
While AI composition inevitably grabs the headlines because of its novelty, new tech is continuing to change many other aspects of the wider music industry.
When the City and County of San Francisco imposed strict lockdowns back in 2020, Matthew Shilvock says that keeping an opera company going proved ""extremely challenging"".
He is general director of the San Francisco Opera, and it could no longer have ""two singers, or even a singer and pianist, in the same room"".
But when he tried running rehearsals with his performers online, ""traditional video conference platforms didn't work"", because of the latency, or delays in the audio and video. They were out of sync.
So, Mr Shilvock turned to a platform called Aloha that has been developed by Swedish music tech start-up Elk. It uses algorithms to reduce latencies.
Elk spokesman, Björn Ehler, claims that while video platforms like Zoom, Skype, and Google Meet have a latency of ""probably 500 to 600 milliseconds"", the Swedish firm has got this down to just 20.
Mr Shilvock says that, when working remotely, Aloha has ""allowed me to hear a singer breathe again"".
He adds that looking to wider tech to help solve problems is only natural for an opera house with Silicon Valley on its doorstep. ""The energy and the drive to find solutions through technology is just so much part of the DNA of this city.""
Meanwhile in Paris, Aurélia Azoulay-Guetta says that, as an amateur classical musician, she ""realised how painful it is to just carry, store, and travel with a lot of physical sheet music for rehearsals, and how much time we waste"".
So she and her fellow co-founder ""decided to junk our jobs"" and launch a start-up called Newzik, which allows music publishers and composers to digitally distribute their sheet music to orchestras.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Ms Azoulay-Guetta says that her solution replaces the stress of musicians having to turn physical, paper pages with their hands during performance or rehearsal. Instead, they now turn a turn a digital page via a connected pedal.
And if the arrangement of a concerto or other composition is tweaked - which can be done by using an electronic pen on the app screen - this will update on every orchestra member's copy of the electronic music sheets.
Ms Azoulay-Guetta says that this feature particularly helped when concerts finally resumed after lockdowns, because orchestras and ensembles faced last minute programme changes - for instance, if musicians were absent, self-isolating.
Other tech firms are focusing on helping musicians more effectively deal with their paperwork. One such company is Portuguese start-up Faniak.
Founder and chief executive, Nuno Moura Santos, describes its app as ""like a Google Drive on steroids"", allowing musicians - who are often freelancers -to more easily do their admin all in one place, ""so they can spend more time writing and playing music"".
Back at Boomy, Mr Mitchell is himself a classically-trained violinist. He says that the firm's users are now popping-up everywhere.
""We have Uber drivers creating albums and playing them during their drives,"" he says. ""And [last year] I woke up to a frantic call from my head of engineers, asking if we were under attack.
""There was tons of traffic from Turkey, and we don't have a Turkish version. It was just a YouTuber in Turkey, who did a video about Boomy, and [from that] we have tens of thousands of users there.""

The US actor and comedian Bob Saget, best known for starring in the sitcom Full House, has died suddenly aged 65, his family has announced. 
The actor was found unresponsive by staff in his room at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Orlando, Florida on Sunday. 
Officers from the Orange County Sheriff's Department arrived after a call from hotel staff and pronounced him dead at the scene. 
The exact details surrounding his death remain unclear. 
But in a short statement posted to Twitter, the Sheriff's Department said that detectives had found no signs of foul play or drug use during initial enquiries. 
""We are devastated to confirm that our beloved Bob passed away today,"" his family said in a statement.
""He was everything to us and we want you to know how much he loved his fans, performing live and bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter.""
Saget, a veteran stand-up comedian, had just started a new comedy tour across the US, performing as recently as Saturday in the city of Jacksonville, Florida. 
After the show he had expressed his joy at being back on stage in a post on his Instagram page, telling fans that he was ""happily addicted"" to his craft. 
""I'm back in comedy like I was when I was 26. I guess I'm finding my new voice and loving every moment of it,"" he said. 
Although Saget was idolised by many comedians for his profane and often cutting act, he was best known in the US for his role in the sitcom, Full House, where he starred alongside the actors John Stamos and fellow comic Dave Coulier. 
He won plaudits for his portrayal of Danny Tanner, a widowed father of three daughters, playing the role from 1987 to 1995. 
He reprised it in 2016 when Netflix revived the programme for a further five seasons. 
In more recent years he found fame among younger generations as the narrator of the hit show How I Met Your Mother and for his guest stints as a highly fictionalised version of himself in the TV series, Entourage. 
John Stamos, who worked with Saget on Full House and Fuller House, said he was ""broken"" at the news of his friend's death. 
Candace Cameron Bure remembered Saget, who played her father on Full House, writing on Twitter that she ""loved him so much"".
Actress Kat Dennings, who played Saget's daughter in television series Raising Dad, described him as a ""wonderful guy"".
Whoopi Goldberg paid tribute to her friend, giving a special mention to his ""huge heart and abject lunacy"".
Accompanying a photo of himself and Saget, actor and writer Penn Jillette wrote on Twitter: ""Saget would have wanted something tweeted that was really funny and in very bad taste. I can't do that. I'm just so sad. Bob was just great on every level and we will all miss him.""
The former Daily Show host Jon Stewart called Saget ""just the funniest and nicest"" in a tweet on Sunday.
And comedian Judd Apatow said: ""Bob Saget was so kind and when you spent time with him he made you laugh hard. He loved to be funny and he was hysterical. He was also there for everyone. A beautiful soul.""

177;Man arrested for bomb threat at Doja Cat concert;['2022-01-10T09:23:52.000Z'];['By Mark Savage'];['music'];['listen', 'way', 'bomb', 'arrested', 'concert', 'man', 'cat', 'cold', 'threat', 'doja', 'care', 'fighting', 'dont'];"
A man has been arrested at a Doja Cat concert in the US, after attempting to jump the queue by making a bomb threat.
Fans had been lining for more than 12 hours for the free show in Indianapolis on Saturday when, at 5pm, the man told people around him he had an explosive device in his backpack.
Police cleared the area for 20 minutes and the concert went ahead after they ensured the backpack was safe.
The man had unrelated outstanding warrants and was arrested for those.
The investigation into the bomb threat is still ongoing, said the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) in a statement.
""A fan wanted to advance in line so he exercised very poor judgement and told those around him in line he had a bomb in his backpack,"" Deputy Chief Joshua Barker told the Indianapolis Star. 
""Someone did the right thing and alerted IMPD. The backpack was clean.""
Doja Cat's show was part of the build-up to Monday's College Football Playoff, which will see the Georgia Bulldogs face off against underdogs Alabama Crimson Tide.
Fans had queued overnight to be at the front of the show, battling ice and freezing rain as temperatures dropped to -9C.
Some expressed their frustration at the disruption on social media.
""My boyfriend and I waited at the front of the line since noon, just for us to get trampled and fearing for our lives,"" wrote Paige Osborne on Twitter.
""Bomb threat and someone in cuffs at the Doja Cat concert 10 minutes before we were supposed to go in. I am LIVID,"" added another fan.
After the short delay, Doja Cat took to the stage around 21:40, wearing an ensemble that paid homage to the football championship.
The star, who has eight nominations at this year's Grammy Awards, raced through hits including Woman, Say So, You Right and Juicy in her 16-song, 90-minute set.
But the show was not without incident itself. A fight broke out in the crowd after the rapper/singer threw a pair of drumsticks into the audience.
""Hey, hey, hey. Chill, chill,"" shouted the star as she halted her band. 
""Listen, no fighting. I don't want to see that, I don't want to see that at all. I care about you, and it's way too cold out here for that.""

178;Ichthyosaur: Huge fossilised ‘sea dragon’ found in Rutland reservoir;['2022-01-10T06:01:17.000Z'];['By Jonah Fisher'];['leicester'];['rutland', 'ichthyosaur', 'inland', 'marine', 'reptiles', 'location', 'jurassic', 'usually', 'dragon', 'unusual', 'reservoir', 'huge', 'think', 'sea', 'yorkshire', 'fossilised', 'coast'];"
""I rang up the county council and I said I think I've found a dinosaur,"" explained Joe Davis, who works at Rutland Water Nature Reserve.
During landscaping work at the reserve's reservoir in February 2021, he'd spotted something odd poking out of the mud. 
It wasn't a dinosaur. But it was the fossilised remains of a ten-metre long sea predator called an ichthyosaur. 
And it was the largest of its type ever discovered in the UK.
""I looked down at what seemed like stones or ridges in the mud and I said this looks a bit organic, a bit different,"" Mr Davis told BBC News. ""Then we saw something that looked almost like a jawbone.""
The council said to Mr Davis: ""We don't have a dinosaur department at Rutland County Council so we're going to have to get someone to call you back."" A team of paleontologists were brought in for a closer look. 
They concluded it was an ichthyosaur - a type of warm-blooded, air-breathing sea predator not unlike dolphins. They could grow up to 25 metres long and lived between 250 million and 90 million years ago.
Dr Dean Lomax, a palaeontologist from Manchester University, was brought in to lead the excavation effort. He called the discovery ""truly unprecedented"" and - due to its size and completeness - ""one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history"".
""Usually we think of ichthyosaurs and other marine reptiles being discovered along the Jurassic coast in Dorset or the Yorkshire coast, where many of them are exposed by the erosion of the cliffs. Here at an inland location is very unusual."" 
Rutland is more than thirty miles from the coast, but 200 million years ago higher sea levels meant it was covered by a shallow ocean. 
When water levels at the Rutland reservoir were lowered again in the late summer of 2021, a team of palaeontologists came in to excavate the remains. Special attention was paid to the removal of the huge skull. 
A large block of clay containing the ichthyosaur's head was carefully dug out before being covered in plaster and placed on wooden splints. 
The block, weighing almost a tonne, was raised out of the mud and will now be examined further. 
""It's not often you are responsible for safely lifting a very important but very fragile fossil weighing that much,"" said Nigel Larkin, palaeontological conservator and Visiting Research Fellow at Reading University. ""It is a responsibility, but I love a challenge.""
Anglian Water, which manages the Rutland reservoir, is now looking for funding to enable the ichthyosaur to stay in the area and be enjoyed by the general public. 
""A lot of people thought I was pulling their leg when I told them I'd found a large marine reptile at work,"" Mr Davis said. ""I think a lot of people won't believe it until the TV programme goes out.""
That TV programme is on Tuesday 11 January at 8pm on BBC Two. ""Digging for Britain"" will then be available on the BBC iPlayer.

180;Past seven years hottest on record - EU satellite data;['2022-01-10T12:00:33.000Z'];['By Georgina Rannard'];['climate change'];['remarked', 'hottest', 'rate', 'past', 'record', 'scientists', 'data', 'methane', 'seven', 'rates', 'parts', 'satellite', 'reach', 'unprecedented', 'eu'];"
The past seven years have been the hottest on record, according to new data from the EU's satellite system.
The Copernicus Climate Change Service said 2021 was the fifth-warmest year, with record-breaking heat in some regions.
And the amount of warming gases in our atmosphere continued to increase. 
Governments are committed to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C to curb climate change. But scientists warn that time is fast running out.
The environmental, human and economic costs of hotter temperatures are already being seen globally. 
Europe lived through its warmest summer, and temperature records in western US and Canada were broken by several degrees. Extreme wildfires in July and August burnt almost entire towns to the ground and killed hundreds. 
""These events are a stark reminder of the need to change our ways, take decisive and effective steps toward a sustainable society and work towards reducing net carbon emissions,"" Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, explains.
The Copernicus data comes from a constellation of Sentinel satellites that monitor the Earth from orbit, as well as measurements taken at ground level.
Copernicus data showed that 2021 was the fifth-hottest on record, marginally warmer than 2015 and 2018. Taken together, the past seven years were the hottest seven years on record by a clear margin, the agency explained.
The 2021 average temperature was 1.1-1.2C above the pre-industrial level around 150 years ago.
It would be easy to dismiss the latest global temperature figure as a non-event. Who celebrates fifth place in anything? 
If we were in a film, these annual temperature updates would be the ominous drum beat signalling the plot is darkening. 
They measure out the pace of change in our world. The increments may be tiny - a fraction of a degree - but the direction of travel is inescapable.  
And make no mistake, the rhythm they mark out increasingly sets the pace for all our lives.  Think of the fires and floods that affected so many people in 2021.
And now look again at what the data is telling us: the seven hottest years ever recorded have been the last seven years.
We can't say we weren't warned. 
The agency said that the start of the year saw relatively low temperatures compared to recent years, but that by June monthly temperatures were at least among the warmest four recorded.
Places with above average temperatures included the west coast of US and Canada, north-east Canada and Greenland, large parts of north and central Africa, and the Middle East. 
The weather phenomenon known as La Niña - when surface sea temperatures are cooler - contributed to below-average temperatures in western and eastern Siberia, Alaska, and the central and eastern Pacific during the start and end of 2021.
Overall Europe's annual temperature was outside the ten warmest years on record but the summer was the hottest.
A heatwave swept through Mediterranean in July and August, particularly affecting Greece, Spain and Italy.
In Sicily, 48.8C degrees was reported, breaking Europe's record for highest temperature by 0.8C. 
The hot temperatures in the eastern and central Mediterranean was followed by intense wildfires particular in Turkey but also in Greece, Italy, Tunisia and Algeria.
And Europe also saw extreme wet weather, with huge floods devastating parts of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
These events were part of the same picture of weather systems disrupted by climate change.
The concentration in the earth's atmosphere of two gases that significantly contribute to climate change rose in 2021, said Copernicus. 
Carbon dioxide concentrations reached 414.3 parts per million last year, growing at a similar rate to 2020.

But scientists remarked that methane levels in the atmosphere increased to reach an unprecedented approximately 1,876 parts per billion. The growth rate of methane was also higher than in 2020 - Copernicus said both rates were very high compared to the past two decades of satellite data.
Scientist say it is important to reduce methane levels because it is more potent than CO2, however it lasts much less time in the Earth's atmosphere.
The increasing concentrations of these gases showed no signs of slowing down, concluded Vincent-Henri Peuch, Director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.
More data about 2021's temperatures will be released in the coming days from other agencies including from Nasa and the UK's Met Office.

181;Djokovic Covid timeline: Did he break rules after testing positive?;['2022-01-10T16:28:42.000Z'];['By Jake Horton'];['serbia', 'reality check', 'australia'];['thank', 'serbian', 'service', 'timeline', 'projects', 'positive', 'testing', 'preschool', 'postal', 'break', 'djokovic', 'share', 'receive', 'stamp', 'covid', 'rules', 'rare'];"
Novak Djokovic sought a medical exemption from Australia's strict Covid visa regulations on the basis that he'd contracted the infection in December.
There is now a focus on whether the tennis star broke the rules in his home country Serbia, with people highlighting several public engagements he apparently attended in the days following his positive test.
Mr Djokovic was tested in Serbia, where you are legally required to isolate for 14 days following a positive Covid test.
Here is a timeline of events from what we know so far. 
Mr Djokovic attended a Euroleague basketball game in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, between Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona.
After the game, numerous people who attended tested positive for Covid-19, so it is possible this is where Mr Djokovic became infected.
In court documents, Mr Djokovic's lawyers submitted evidence that confirms he took a PCR test just after 13:00 on 16 December.
The document from the Institute of Public Health of Serbia states the result came back positive seven hours later, at about 20:00 on the same day.
It is unclear whether Mr Djokovic was told he had Covid at that point.
During a press conference held by the Djokovic family in Belgrade on 10 January, his brother was asked: ""Is it true that on 16 December he [Novak] tested positive and he knew he was positive with Covid?""
This video can not be played
His brother responded: ""Yes, the whole process was public and all the documents that are public are legal.""
Mr Djokovic attended a panel discussion and a ceremony for the unveiling of a stamp in his honour in Belgrade on 16 December (before 20:00), which he posted about on Twitter the next day.
On the morning of 17 December, the Tennis Association of Belgrade posted on Facebook about an award ceremony at the Novak Tennis Center in Belgrade which was happening later that day.
They said the trophies would be ""handed over to the young talent by the favourite tennis player of this region, and beyond"".
Later that day, a series of pictures was posted on the same Facebook page of Mr Djokovic presenting awards without a mask.
It has been reported by French newspaper L'Equipe that Mr Djokovic attended a photo shoot with one of their photographers on 18 December.
He posed with the newspaper's Champion of Champions trophy - an award which recognises the outstanding sportsperson of the year.
The paper says he wore a face mask during an interview, but removed it for the photo shoot.
In the court documents provided by Mr Djokovic's lawyers, there is confirmation that he had another PCR test on 22 December.
This test came back negative at 16:15 the same afternoon.
Serbian Covid regulations require a full 14-day isolation period, so Mr Djokovic's quarantine would have ended on 30 December.

182;Flamur Beqiri: Murder accused came to London to 'Netflix and chill';['2022-01-10T16:57:54.000Z'];['BBC News'];['hm courts service'];['beqiri', 'netflix', 'flamur', 'sweden', 'mr', 'hemissi', 'met', 'murder', 'came', 'girl', 'meet', 'london', 'saying', 'true', 'harounoff', 'difficult', 'accused', 'chill'];"
A kickboxer accused of shooting dead a man in front of his family on Christmas Eve two years ago has denied being a professional hitman. 
Anis Hemissi, 24, is on trial charged with murdering Flamur Beqiri, 36, in Battersea, south-west London, in 2019. 
He told a jury at Southwark Crown Court he flew from Copenhagen to London to ""Netflix and chill"" with a woman.
He is accused of wearing disguises to carry out reconnaissance in the days before the alleged killing. 
The court heard Mr Beqiri, whose sister, Misse Beqiri appeared in reality television show The Real Housewives Of Cheshire, was ""involved in serious and organised crime"".
Prosecutors allege Mr Hemissi was part of a team of four killers sent from Sweden to assassinate Mr Beqiri, a father or two, as part of a violent rivalry between two organised crime networks in the Scandinavian country.  
Giving evidence, Mr Hemissi said he flew to London from Copenhagen, Denmark, on 20 December, 2019 to meet a 22-year-old woman, Nadine, who had befriended him on Facebook.
He told jurors she was one of ""more than 20 girls"" he was speaking to on social media and dating apps.
He said he travelled to London to meet her after she told him her father would not let her travel abroad. 
""We were going to have Netflix and chill, relax, maybe go out and eat something, maybe go out and buy some clothes,"" he said.
Mr Hemissi told jurors Nadine had arranged for him to stay in her friend's flat - which was allegedly used by the men after being rented through Airbnb - but made excuses not to see him.
David Harounoff, defending, asked Mr Hemissi: ""There may be some people in court who find it difficult to accept you had come from Sweden to meet a girl you had never met before. Is what you are saying true?""
His client replied: ""Yes, it's happened many times before.""
Jurors were shown CCTV footage of the shooting, which saw Mr Beqiri hit by eight bullets as the gunman fired 10 times while Mr Beqiri was about to enter his home with his wife, Debora Krasniqi, and two-year-old son.
Ms Krasniqi could be heard screaming and cradling their son, moments after they had arrived hand in hand with the victim.
When Mr Harounoff questioned Mr Hemissi, who denies murder and possession of a self-loading pistol, he said he was not the gunman and was not a professional hitman. 
Swedish nationals Estevan Pino-Munizaga, 35, Tobias Fredrik Andersson, 32, and Bawer Karaer, 23, also deny murder. 
Clifford Rollox, 31, of Islington, north London, and Claude Isaac Castor, 31, of Catford, south-east London, deny perverting the course of justice.
The trial continues.

184;GM pigs take step to being organ donors;['2017-08-11T01:01:52.000Z'];['By James Gallagher'];['medical research', 'genetics', 'transplants', 'pigs', 'genetic engineering'];['mountains', 'organ', 'gm', 'challenging', 'audacious', 'world', 'vision', 'remove', 'donors', 'know', 'organs', 'shortage', 'motivation', 'pigs', 'step'];"
The most genetically modified animals in existence have been created to help end a shortage of organs for transplant, say US researchers. 
The scientists successfully rid 37 pigs of viruses hiding in their DNA, overcoming one of the big barriers to transplanting pig organs to people.
The team at eGenesis admits preventing pig organs from being rejected by the human body remains a huge challenge 
But experts said it was a promising and exciting first step. 
The study, published in the journal Science, started with skin cells from a pig.
Tests identified 25 Pervs - porcine endogenous retroviruses - hidden in the pig's genetic code.
Experiments mixing human and pig cells together showed those viruses could escape to infect human tissues.
But the researchers then used the game-changing gene-editing technology Crispr to delete the 25 Pervs.
It then took cloning technology, the same used to create Dolly the sheep, to place the genetic material from those cells into a pig's egg and create embryos. 
The complex process is inefficient, but 37 healthy piglets have been born.
""These are the first Perv-free pigs,"" Dr Luhan Yang, one of the researchers from Harvard University and the spinout company eGenesis, told the BBC News website.
They were also ""the most genetically modified [animals] in terms of the number of modifications"", he said.
If xenotransplantation - using organs from other species - works, then it has the potential to alleviate long waits for a transplant. 
More than 100,000 people need an organ transplant in the US. There are about 6,500 people on the UK waiting list. 
Dr Yang told the BBC: ""We recognise we are still at the early stages of research and development.
""We know we have an audacious vision of a world with no shortage of organs, that is very challenging, but that is also our motivation to remove mountains."" 
Pigs are particularly promising for xenotransplantation as their organs are a similar size to humans', and the animals can be bred in large numbers.
But removing the viruses is only half the challenge, even organs donated from other people can cause a strong immune reaction that leads to the transplant being rejected.
The US team is investigating further genetic modifications to make pig organs more acceptable to the human immune system. 
Darren Griffin, a genetics professor at the University of Kent, said: ""This represents a significant step forward towards the possibility of making xenotransplantation a reality.
""However, there are so many variables, including ethical issues, to resolve before xenotransplantation can take place.""
Prof Ian McConnell, from the University of Cambridge, said: ""This work provides a promising first step in the development of genetic strategies for creating strains of pigs where the risk of transmission of retroviruses has been eliminated. 
""It remains to be seen whether these results can be translated into a fully safe strategy in organ transplantation.""  
The researchers had to overcome unexpected challenges from performing so much gene-editing in one go. 
The Crispr technology works like a combination of a sat-nav and a pair of scissors. The sat-nav finds the right spot in the genetic code, and then the scissors perform the cut. 
But making 25 cuts throughout the pig's genome led to DNA instability and the loss of genetic information.

186;The controversy of wood pellets as a green energy source;['2022-01-11T00:01:20.000Z'];['By Christine Ro'];['pollution', 'cop26', 'green economy', 'north carolina', 'climate change', 'environment', 'drax group'];['short', 'wageningen', 'netherlands', 'replanted', 'wood', 'panel', 'prof', 'pellets', 'researches', 'university', 'green', 'trees', 'controversy', 'source', 'energy'];"
This is the first of two Business of Technology articles examining the way wood pellets are produced and used as an energy source.
The areas in and around North Carolina's forests feel spacious. Canopies of lanky pine trees eventually give way to enormous car parks and long-term storage units, underscoring the feeling of vastness.
Many of these US trees are destined to be turned into small pellets for the biomass industry. At wood pellet mills, wood is chipped, dried, ground and compressed into uniform, easily storable pellets. They're then shipped mainly to the UK, where they're burned for energy.
Most forest land in North Carolina is privately owned, in holdings that can be as small as one acre (0.4ha). This can mean they are too small to qualify for conservation easements - agreements encouraging landowners to keep trees intact, sometimes with tax benefits.
Small forest owners here include a number of third-generation African Americans whose ancestors moved north and west as part of the Great Migration (the movement of six million African Americans between 1916-70 out of the rural southern US to the urban Northeast, Midwest and West) leaving the cropland to turn back into forest. 
""A lot of minority landowners are really disconnected from their land,"" says Freddie Davis III, a forester who leads the Rural Training and Research Center, which is part of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives. 
Mr Davis believes that biomass is the best option on such low-value holdings for these owners - who typically live away from their forest land and often not even in the same state. ""I'm super passionate about it because it offers opportunity,"" he says.
Yet the racial justice aspect is complex. Sherri White-Williamson, who leads environmental justice policy for the North Carolina Conservation Network, works out of a cramped office in Clinton. The area has a large black population and is about 20 minutes away from a pellet mill. ""We've pretty much become the dumping ground for a lot of things for the sake of economic development,"" she says. 
While the wood pellet industry is an important local employer, Ms White-Williamson argues that the effects on water, air and noise mean that these companies aren't the best of neighbours. 
Volatile organic compounds from wood pellet manufacture, especially softwood like pine, are a problem because of the way they're converted into formaldehyde and other noxious substances, says Derb S Carter Junior, a lawyer at the Southern Environmental Law Center. 
Enviva, the world's main producer of wood pellets, counters that its plants are in compliance with air quality regulations. 
Biomass is controversial, not just locally for the affects on communities near pellet plants, but also globally for the unusual way that its carbon emissions are counted. Many argue that the current carbon accounting rules on wood pellets are not fit for purpose. 
They are accounted at the harvest site, such as in North Carolina, rather than the place where they are actually burnt, notably at the UK's Drax power station in Yorkshire. 
The reason for this is that because the trees are replanted, this form of energy is renewable. Decades ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) agreed under the Kyoto Protocol that it would be simpler to account for the carbon emissions of land use only when harvested.
But these decisions have been not just scientific but political, says Peg Putt, who coordinates biomass campaigns for the Environmental Paper Network: The negotiators mainly ""come out of the forest agencies of the various countries, have close ties to industry and work to advantage the interests of the forest industry,"" she argues.
""They have made the accounting seem so forbiddingly complicated and technical that higher level negotiators in the party delegations just leave it to them."" 
More technology of business:
Lawyer Derb Carter says the US now has a ""proliferation"" of wood pellet mills ""where - they're all for export, mostly to Europe - and essentially no utilisation of this material here in the US for energy production"".
In 2018-19, all of the wood pellets fed into the UK's Drax power station were imported. Mr Carter says for the EU, UK, and increasingly Japan and South Korea, this system is ""almost a free ticket in some ways"". 
The emissions from burning wood don't actually show up in these countries' emissions records, because of what he says are the ""perverse accounting"" rules on wood pellets' carbon emissions.
A growing number of scientists and policymakers understand that biomass is not an instantaneously carbon-neutral source of renewable energy. Mr Carter says it is a ""simplistic notion"" that trees are a renewable resource. Trees cut for biomass can take 30-100 years to fully grow back. Even if they store some carbon as they grow - the maximum amount of carbon dioxide is only absorbed by fully mature trees.
Drax defends it use of wood chips to make electricity.
""Biomass is a reliable, flexible renewable power source which is available regardless of what the weather does. It therefore has a vital role to play in the energy system, displacing coal and supporting the grid to further decarbonise, by enabling more renewables like wind and solar to come online,"" a spokesperson said.  
Wood pellet producer Enviva points out it is not sourcing from pristine forests, but managed forests which need to be thinned periodically to maintain good health, yet whose wood quality isn't high enough for higher-value markets like paper. 
According to Enviva, its wood pellet mix is made up of 20% sawmill residues, 14% thinning, and the remainder from harvest.
Kim Cesafsky, Enviva's director of sustainability, is adamant that ""we directly displace coal"". She calls fossil fuels ""a one-way street"", in contrast to biomass.
Yet biomass is actually even more polluting than coal. ""Burning wood for energy produces at least as much carbon dioxide as burning coal per unit of energy produced and usually more,"" Ms Putt explains.
Wood is less energy dense than coal, so ""you have to put more into burning it to get the amount of energy that you want - therefore you release, generally, more carbon dioxide,"" she says. 
Prof Gert-Jan Nabuurs, who researches forestry at Wageningen University, the Netherlands, is one of the coordinating lead authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He acknowledges that wood does not burn as efficiently as natural gas or coal ""and that is why for the same amount of energy, you are emitting more"". But he argues that ""this biomass for bioenergy is a short cycle"" as the trees are replanted.
Yet this idea runs contrary to proforestation - the principle of keeping forests intact - because as diverse forests are replaced with plantations of a single tree species, this makes them not only more vulnerable to disease but also generally less efficient at sequestering carbon. 
According to Ms Putt: ""Plantations are less carbon dense than are natural forests, generally speaking, and they get logged more frequently. So they have less opportunities to sequester carbon.""
The second story on wood pellets in this series will cover how power stations are using biomass to generate electricity and will be published on Friday 14th January.

188;Covid: Fact-checking the doctor who challenged the health secretary;['2022-01-10T18:47:29.000Z'];['By Rachel Schraer'];['long covid', 'coronavirus vaccines', 'reality check', 'vaccine passports', 'sajid javid'];['secretary', 'strong', 'challenged', 'doctor', 'spends', 'factchecking', 'vaccine', 'viz', 'dr', 'told', 'suggest', 'weight', 'wanted', 'covid', 'health', 'spare'];"
A video clip of an unvaccinated doctor challenging the health secretary over the government's plan to make NHS staff have a Covid jab - or risk losing their job - has been viewed more than a million times on social media. 
Making vaccination a condition of employment already applies to care-home staff and, from 1 April, is being extended to NHS workers - about 90% of whom are already vaccinated. 
Dr Steve James - a critical care consultant who has chosen not to be vaccinated - told Sajid Javid, during the health secretary's visit to King's College Hospital, ""the science isn't strong enough"" to support the policy.
""The vaccines are reducing transmission only for about eight weeks with Delta,"" he said.
""For Omicron, it's probably less.""
But that's not exactly what the evidence shows. 
While vaccines remain very good at protecting against becoming severely ill with Covid, the protection they give against catching it and passing it on does wane more quickly. 
Dr James was referring to a study that found a vaccinated person with Covid was just 2% less likely than an unvaccinated person to pass it on, 12 weeks after a second Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - he acknowledges his reference to ""eight weeks"" was an error. 
But the same study found the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which NHS staff are likely to have had, endured better. Vaccinated people had a 25% lower risk of infecting others than unvaccinated people after 12 weeks.
And this research alone doesn't tell the whole story - the vaccines also reduce people's risk to others by stopping them catching the virus in the first place.
One paper found those vaccinated with Pfizer 85% less likely than the unvaccinated to be infected with Covid after two weeks and 75% less likely after 12 weeks.
Vaccinated people also seem to clear the virus faster and have less of it in their system - reducing their chances of passing it on.
These studies all looked at the Delta variant, first identified in India. 
Two vaccine doses appear to be less effective against catching and passing on Omicron infections - although, they are still good at preventing severe illness - but much of the benefit is restored with a third booster jab. 
The second part of Dr James's argument was that he had probably had Covid, providing him with some protection without a vaccine.
""I've got antibodies,"" he said.
""I've been working on the Covid [intensive-care unit] since the beginning.""
So-called natural immunity - having immune cells such as antibodies and T-cells in your system that recognise and fight off the virus from an infection rather than a vaccine - can offer effective protection, although it comes with the risk of becoming very ill or developing ""long Covid"".
But what the doctor didn't mention is that, as with his point about vaccines, this protection also wanes and may be ineffective against infection with a different variant.  
An Imperial College London study suggests the protection from having had Covid against infection by the Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa, ""may be as low as 19%"".
The best protection against Covid comes from having an infection and being vaccinated too, several pieces of research have found.
This video can not be played
Dominic Wilkinson, a professor of medical ethics, at the University of Oxford, says doctors have a clear ethical duty to be vaccinated but sacking someone who is not but can show they have had a recent infection that may provide similar protection may be unjustifiable.
If the vaccines completely blocked transmission, it would be a much simpler question, he says.
But since they are less effective against new variants, it is ""no longer as clear"". 
Dr James says he is not against all Covid vaccination but feels he was framed as such online, after opposing compulsory jabs.
He describes himself as ""pro-choice and pro-vaccine"", saying his point was specifically about the science behind the mandate not the vaccine itself. 
But another NHS hospital doctor, Dr Meenal Viz, who spends her spare time online correcting misinformation, told BBC News she feared the clip of Dr James would be seized on by those who wanted to suggest the science for the vaccine in general was not strong enough - despite the huge weight of evidence from hundreds of independent institutions and millions of people that it prevented disease and death.
This fits into a pattern she regularly sees online, where short clips, single statistics or lines from a scientific study taken out of context can ""completely blow up"" and cause more confusion than straightforward falsehoods. 
""On the internet, when things go viral, people tend to cherry-pick what they want,"" Dr Viz said, potentially leaving people with the impression an intensive care doctor was doubting the science of the vaccine, rather than the much narrower and more complicated point Dr James says he was making. 
And her fears were not misplaced.
Dr James's comments were eagerly seized on by those against vaccination, including some promoting false theories such as the virus is a hoax. 
BBC News also found it referenced in more extreme encrypted chat groups, including one used to organise removals of sick patients from hospital against doctors' advice and coordinate the serving of bogus legal writs accusing doctors and teachers of crimes against humanity.
But Dr James stands by his comments: ""If people wish to polarise, they will do that,"" he says.

Labour and some Tory MPs are demanding immediate answers on whether Boris Johnson attended a drinks event in the Downing Street garden during lockdown.
In heated scenes in the Commons, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said the PM ""can run, but can't hide"" from scrutiny over the May 2020 gathering.
And Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Mr Johnson must quit if found to have broken Covid rules.
The PM has declined to say whether he went to the drinks.
He will face MPs for what is likely to be a volatile session of Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.
On Monday, ITV published a leaked email from Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, inviting 100 staff to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"" on 20 May 2020 - when lockdown rules in England banned large outdoor gatherings.
The invitation encouraged people to ""bring your own booze"" and ""make the most of the lovely weather"". 
Witnesses have told the BBC the prime minister and his wife Carrie were among about 30 people who attended the drinks.
An inquiry - led by senior civil servant Sue Gray - is under way into this event and other gatherings that took place on government premises during 2020.
""We should get rid of him…. We should own the situation. We are the Tory party. We are not delivering good governance.""
That stinging verdict from a Conservative MP does not, at least not yet, seem to represent the consensus among the party's ranks on what to do about the current situation in Downing Street.
But the goodwill-to-all-men moment the Christmas holidays promised is very much over.
The subject of conversation among Tories on Tuesday was not the government's planned menu of policy fare for the week, but whether or not the moment had arrived when Boris Johnson, election-winner, had become Boris Johnson, discredited liability.

Standing in for Mr Johnson in the Commons on Tuesday, minister Michael Ellis said he expected Ms Gray's work to be ""swift"".
But he warned it could be ""paused"" if the Metropolitan Police - which says it is in contact with the government over reports of alleged breaches of Covid rules - decided to carry out its own investigation.
Mr Ellis added that it was not for him to ""pass judgement or to pass sentence"" before Ms Gray's findings were known.
But Labour MPs lined up to recount stories of constituents who had suffered during the pandemic and to accuse the government of hypocrisy.
Ms Rayner said it was disappointing that Mr Johnson was not there in person to respond, adding: ""But his absence speaks volumes, as do his smirks on the media.
""The public has already drawn its own conclusions. He can run, but he can't hide.""

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey asked: ""Will the minister set out what he thinks should happen if a Conservative MP is found to have flouted and broken a Covid law?""
And DUP MP Jim Shannon was brought to tears when speaking of the death of his mother-in-law during the pandemic.
SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on Conservative MPs to ""force [the PM] from office"" if he did not ""do the decent thing"" and resign.
Few Tory MPs turned up in the Commons to support Mr Johnson, but one who did, Suzanne Webb, said: ""The time of the House is better spent at this moment in time, as we recover from this pandemic... debating how we can build back better and level up.""
But Scottish leader Douglas Ross told the BBC he felt ""fury"" over what had happened, adding that Mr Johnson should resign if he ""broke the law"".
""People gave up so much and they're now seeing at the exact same time, potentially, those at the top in No 10 were enjoying the weather and having a drink in the garden,"" he said.
""I can't answer the question 'was the prime minister there?' He can, and the public deserve that answer.""
Tory MP Nigel Mills told the BBC: ""The idea that during the worst lockdown - when you could only see one other person - that the people organising the rules were having a party is just unacceptable. It's indefensible.""
""I think if [Mr Johnson] knowingly attended what he knew to be party, then he can't survive that.""
Conservative former minister Johnny Mercer tweeted about the drinks gathering: ""It's humiliating, and does not reflect the majority of my colleagues who 'at least try' and lead by example.""
Another ex-minister told the BBC that Mr Johnson ""tries to lie his way out of everything"", while another said: ""Boris is finished.""
The PM's official spokesman refused to comment on claims surrounding the drinks event while the investigation was taking place, but he added that the prime minister retained full confidence in Mr Reynolds.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to attend Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, having missed last week's session because of a positive Covid test.

190;Winter Olympics: What is China's Covid policy and does it work?;['2022-01-12T00:26:24.000Z'];['By Kai Wang and Wanyuan Song'];['china', 'reality check', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['winter', 'foreign', 'spectators', 'quarantine', 'chinas', 'venues', 'travel', 'return', 'does', 'residents', 'leave', 'parts', 'mainland', 'covid', 'policy', 'work', 'olympics'];"
Beijing says it's adopting all necessary coronavirus safety measures for the 2022 Winter Olympics, which start next month. 
So what is being planned for the Games, and how successful has China's policy of ""zero Covid"" been?
China is going to great lengths to keep the virus out.
It has said that foreign spectators will be barred, with only residents of mainland China allowed in to events - they must also quarantine when they leave the venues to return home. People are advised not to travel into the capital from other parts of the country.  
It has already created an Olympic bubble by keeping the media, athletes and observers in three distinct bubbles, with the rules saying anyone entering these bubbles must be fully vaccinated or spend 21 days in quarantine. 
Covid testing is carried out on a daily basis, and face masks are required at all times. 
No-one can leave the bubbles. Overseas participants will enter them upon arrival in China, and remain in a bubble until they leave the country. 
Local support workers, including volunteers, cooks and drivers, are also part of a sealed bubble. They'll have no physical contact with the outside world, even with their families. 
This system applies not just to housing, hospitals and locations meant to serve the Olympics, but also transport links.
There are closed-loop airports and high-speed rail systems (given that most major venues are outside of Beijing).
All designated vehicles for Olympic personnel are labelled with a special red sign on the front, and local traffic authorities have even advised the public to ""avoid contact"" if they have a road accident with them. Rubbish will be held at temporary storage sites, to prevent cross-infection. 
Travel in and out of China is severely restricted for foreigners, and there have been restrictions on internal movement since the pandemic began.
Any travellers from abroad who do have permission to enter China are screened on arrival, and sent to government-designated hotels for a mandatory quarantine of at least two weeks. 
In most cities, this is followed by a further seven days of hotel or home quarantine, and then a seven-day monitoring period when social mixing is prohibited and regular reporting to local health officials is required.
China has stopped issuing and renewing passports for ""non-urgent purposes"" to its own citizens both at home and abroad, to further minimise international travel. 
There are also strict controls on moving between China's cities (and sometimes between individual neighbourhoods) with further mandatory periods of self-isolation for those permitted to travel.
With the games approaching, China has put some cities into lockdown where cases have been detected.
During these, people are only allowed to leave for ""urgent matters"", such as going to hospital. Surveillance by the police and local volunteers is also being stepped up, with harsh penalties for anyone breaking the rules.
Residents can be evicted from their homes at short notice and sent to quarantine facilities if infections are detected during a mass testing campaign. All non-essential businesses are shut, apart from food shops and some other essential suppliers.   
Schools are closed and public transport is suspended, with almost all vehicle movement banned.  
On the face of it, China has had remarkable success containing the pandemic.
Since the end of 2019, China has reported just over 4,600 deaths (according to Our World in Data). In the United States, more than 830,000 have died and in the UK, just over 150,000.
Per million people, that's around three deaths in China, compared with 2,500 in the US and 2,190 in the UK.
Reported infections in China have also been very low, rarely rising above 150 a day across the country throughout the pandemic.
Concerns have been expressed about the accuracy of the official data, but it seems clear that both infection and death rates have been low when compared with other countries. The National Health Commission in China says 85% of its population is now fully vaccinated. 
Despite this, China is almost alone in adhering to a zero-Covid policy regardless of the cost to personal freedoms and to the economy.
Other countries, such as Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, modified their strict adherence to zero Covid in the latter part of 2021. The Delta variant was taking hold anyway and these countries had also managed to push up their vaccination rates.
Cases did then rise in those three countries, but the hope is that sufficient vaccination will keep serious illness and death to manageable levels.
In China's case, there must be concerns that the country could be at risk of widespread outbreaks were its strict controls lifted too quickly.
""With current [Chinese-made] vaccines and the variants, an exit wave would be certain to occur if China were to reopen soon"", says Prof Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong.

191;Covid: Welsh word cwtch used in Parliament for first time;['2022-01-11T18:08:40.000Z'];['BBC News'];['coronavirus lockdown measures', 'uk parliament'];['meeting', 'team', 'socially', 'used', 'politician', 'wales', 'welsh', 'cwtch', 'regulations', 'word', 'pub', 'office', 'parliament', 'covid', 'rules'];"
The popular Welsh word cwtch has been used for the first time in the UK Parliament.
It commonly means a hug or cuddle but has no literal English translation.
Brecon and Radnorshire MP Fay Jones said cwtch while questioning Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the House of Commons on 5 January.
It is the only time the word has been recorded in Hansard, which publicly publishes a record of all parliamentary debates verbatim.
The Conservative politician was criticising Wales' Covid regulations last Wednesday and said: ""On Friday, I will be holding my team meeting in the local pub because under Welsh government rules we are not allowed to go to our socially distanced office. 
""We cannot do Parkrun and we cannot watch outdoor sport on the touchline - but we can cwtch up together in the clubhouse to watch it.
""May I commend the prime minister for his bold decisions, and ask whether he agrees that the inconsistencies in the rules in Wales are not just ludicrous, but are harming the Welsh economy?""
Mr Johnson replied referring to the country's rules, which include mask-wearing indoors and the two-metre rule in public venues, as ""baroque eccentricities"".
Ms Jones tweeted: ""Absolutely delighted to learn this morning that my use of the word 'cwtch' in the Commons last week was the first time that word has ever been used in Parliament.""
In 2019, another Welsh MP, Rhondda's Chris Bryant, was making an ultimately unsuccessful run for election as Commons Speaker when he said that MPs ""need more of a cwtch"" - although he said it in interviews outside the chamber.

Nearly 75 years after the end of World War Two, the UK's last tank regiment in Germany, the Queen's Royal Hussars, returned home. 
British photographer Tobias Wilkinson spent a year documenting the daily life of the soldiers in their barracks and on manoeuvres, before they came back to the UK in 2019.
Nicknamed ""Churchill's Own"", the Queen's Royal Hussars is the most senior armoured regiment in the British Army and is equipped with dozens of main battle tanks. 
The regiment was formed in 1993 from the Queen's Own Hussars and the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, which both stemmed from the 1958 mergers of the 3rd, 4th, 7th and 8th Hussars, which were established in the late 17th Century. 
Before relocating to Tidworth, Wiltshire, the regiment had largely been based at Athlone Barracks in Sennelager, North Rhine-Westphalia, since 1998. 
The barracks were first used by the Prussian army in 1851 and have been mainly occupied by a series of British tank regiments since the end of World War Two.
""I have a home in Germany and became interested in the subject of the British Army's departure because it coincided with Brexit and increased Russian military posturing in Eastern Europe,"" says Mr Wilkinson, who is also a former soldier.
""Of the soldiers I photographed, there was a poignancy and nostalgia about being in the British Army in its closing moments in Germany,"" he adds.
""Many had enjoyed their experience of living in Europe, and whilst many were glad to be nearer their families in the UK, many who were more established were sad to be leaving.""
The Last Hussar exhibition is on at the National Army Museum in London until 28 January 2022.

194;Downing Street party: What Covid rules were broken?;['2022-01-12T14:00:56.000Z'];['By Tom Edgington'];['coronavirus lockdown measures', 'reality check'];['street', 'downing', 'thank', 'mr', 'broken', 'mps', 'minutes', 'covid', 'staff', 'returned', 'went', 'office', 'technically', 'party', 'told', 'rules'];"
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has apologised for attending a party in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown, but said he believed ""implicitly that this was a work event"".
It is the latest in a number of alleged parties to have taken place under Covid restrictions, which are currently being investigated by senior civil servant Sue Gray.
An email, sent to as many as 100 people in Downing Street, invited them to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening"".
The email, revealed by ITV News, was sent on behalf of Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds.
It is understood that about 30 people attended the event on 20 May 2020. Two eyewitnesses had already told the BBC they saw Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie there.
In his apology, Mr Johnson told MPs he went into the garden just after 18:00 to thank groups of staff and returned to his office 25 minutes later. He said that the event ""could be said to fall technically within the guidance"". 
Throughout the pandemic there has been a mixture of guidance and legal restrictions relating to behaviour likely to spread the virus. 
Legal restrictions are underpinned by sanctions - where breaking the law could result in prosecution. Guidance - unless it's also backed up in law - is not enforced by fines or court action, explains Stuart Nolan from the Law Society.
In terms of guidance:
When it came to workplace gatherings, the guidelines said: ""Workers should try to minimise all meetings and other gatherings in the workplace.""
The ""working safely during coronavirus"" guidelines also said only absolutely necessary participants should attend meetings and should maintain 2m separation throughout."" Generally, workers were told to ""reduce the number of people you spend time with in a work setting"". 
There is nothing in the guidelines that would suggest that drinking, socialising or other types of work event would have been allowed.
There were also a number of legal restrictions in place in May 2020:
People could not leave their homes - or be outside the place they live - without a reasonable excuse, which included work (where you couldn't work from home), exercise and getting things like food and medicine.
For people who broke these rules, the police in England could fine them £100 for the first offence which could then double for each further offence up to a maximum of £3,200.
It would be difficult to see how the Downing Street event would have been in line with these rules, argues barrister Adam Wagner.
""If you were doing something which wasn't necessary for work then you weren't outside of your house [with] a reasonable excuse and you were potentially committing a criminal offence.""
However, Mr Wagner added that as the prime minister and his wife live in Downing Street they would not have technically left their home to attend the party.
Mr Wagner is involved in a case to bring a judicial review against the Met Police for not investigating the alleged parties.
The law also banned gatherings in a public place of more than two people, unless they were all members of the same household or the gathering was ""essential for work purposes"". However, lawyers have noted that Downing Street is not a public place. 
The official gov.uk Twitter account posted this tweet on the same day as the Downing Street garden party.
A number of other gatherings are alleged to have taken place in Downing Street during 2020.
One was alleged to have taken place on 27 November - a leaving party for Cleo Watson, a former aide to Dominic Cummings.
At this point a national lockdown was in force and indoor gatherings with other households were not allowed (unless for work).
This lockdown ended on 2 December and England returned to the tier system of restrictions where there was a specific prohibition on organising an indoor gathering of more than 30 people.
When a Downing Street Christmas quiz took place on 15 December, London was under tier 2 restrictions. These rules banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless ""reasonably necessary"" for work purposes.
The same rule would have applied when a party - which was joked about in a leaked Downing Street press conference video - was alleged to have taken place on 18 December. At this point London had been moved to tougher tier 3 restrictions.
Furthermore, the government's guidance for the Christmas period specifically said: ""Although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.""
This same line was also tweeted out by the official gov.uk account on 17 December 2020 in response to a question from a member of the public about whether Christmas parties were allowed in the workplace.
Allegations of Downing Street parties first surfaced in the Daily Mirror, when it reported in early December that a party had been held in Number 10 during the 2020 Christmas period.
In response, Mr Johnson told MPs that that ""all guidance was followed completely in No 10"". 
However, after the Downing Street press conference video was leaked - which appeared to confirm a Christmas party took place - Mr Johnson said he understood the public anger.
""It goes without saying that if rules were broken then there will be disciplinary action for all those involved,"" Mr Johnson said. 
Later, when details of the Downing Street quiz emerged, Mr Johnson said he ""certainly broke no rules"". Number 10 said that the prime minister ""briefly took part virtually"" to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. 
Two people pictured with Mr Johnson - wearing tinsel and a Santa hat - were members of his closer staff who had come in to help him with the technology, according to Downing Street.
Number 10 also insisted that no rules were broken when a photo emerged of the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden from 15 May. Mr Johnson said that the photo showed ""people at work"", which was allowed under the rules.

A major Conservative donor has issued an ultimatum to Boris Johnson over revelations about lockdown parties in Downing Street.
John Caudwell said: ""Sort it out, Boris, or step aside and let someone else sort it out so that the Tories aren't wiped out at the next election.""
The Phones4U founder donated £500,000 to the Conservatives ahead of the 2019 general election.
He criticised the government's perceived ""arrogance and hypocrisy"".
Mr Caudwell was one of the Conservative Party's biggest individual donors at the last general election, and has previously given money to pro-Brexit Tory MP Sir Bill Cash.
He told BBC News: ""Although I have always obeyed the rules I have never been puritanical about lockdown restrictions so I find it difficult to personally get excited about an outdoor drinks party. But it's the perceived arrogance, hypocrisy and rule breaking that is impossible to justify. 
""While the rest of us were striving to follow the ever-changing rules - including myself, even when I deemed them to be excessive at best, nonsensical at worst - those who were setting those rules were, apparently freely and frequently, disregarding them.
""Each one of these new revelations gives greater force to the accusation that areas of the government think it's 'one rule for them, one rule for the rest of us'.
""This is disastrous.""
He added that he was not a ""dyed-in-the-wool Tory"" and had been critical of the government's economic recovery plans, urging more investment in apprenticeships and renewable energy.
But he added: ""I do think the Conservatives are the best party to govern this country, particularly as we look to navigate opportunities post-Brexit. 
""Sort it out, Boris, or step aside and let someone else sort it out so that the Tories aren't wiped out at the next election.""
Alasdair Locke, who has donated £280,000 to the Conservative Party since Mr Johnson came to power, said the lockdown parties were ""something the media is making a great deal of"" and voters would be concerned with ""serious stuff"" at the next election.
""I really don't think a leadership change, or challenge, is needed at this stage. A bit more grip would help but that will probably come."" 
The prime minister is under growing pressure from Labour - and anger from some Conservatives - over his alleged attendance at a previously unreported Downing Street party.
It comes after ITV published a leaked email from the PM's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, inviting 100 staff to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"" on 20 May 2020.
The invitation for the event, which was organised when strict lockdown rules were still in place, encouraged people to ""bring your own booze"" and ""make the most of the lovely weather"".
Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife had been among about 30 people who attended the gathering.
But Mr Johnson has declined to say whether he was one of them.
The PM's official spokesman also refused to comment on the claims while the investigation was taking place, but he added that the prime minister retained full confidence in Mr Reynolds.
Senior civil servant Sue Gray is investigating lockdown parties in Downing Street, including the event on 20 May 2020, and is expected to report shortly.

196;Brazil rains: Minas Gerais hit by deadly landslides and floods;['2022-01-12T11:08:28.000Z'];['BBC News'];['floods', 'brazil', 'severe weather'];['gerais', 'gonçalo', 'floods', 'deadly', 'wall', 'rains', 'hit', 'sleeping', 'minas', 'brazil', 'rio', 'killed', 'horizonte', 'hillside', 'near', 'landslides', 'state', 'são'];"
Landslides and flooding caused by torrential rains have killed at least 10 people in south-eastern Brazil, officials say.
The victims died on Sunday and Monday in Minas Gerais state, where rivers have overflown, leaving towns partially submerged.
More than 17,000 people have had to leave their homes.
Authorities are monitoring dams that could burst, as more downpours could affect the hardest-hit areas. 
Five people from the same family, two of them children, were found buried on a hillside near the state capital, Belo Horizonte. In the city of São Gonçalo do Rio Abaixo, an 11-year-old girl was killed when a wall collapsed on her bedroom as she was sleeping.
Two other deaths were reported in the city of Caratinga, including a 41-year-old man who was killed when his car fell into a river while he tried to cross a bridge. 
In the town of Juatuba, the Paraopeba river burst its banks, leaving entire neighbourhoods flooded. ""We lost everything. My wife and children left the house in a boat,"" Daniel Valeriano de Oliveira told AFP news agency.
Brazil's mining agency said 36 mining dams were in a state of emergency in the state. On Saturday, a dam at an iron ore mine in Nova Lima overflowed, disrupting traffic on a major highway for two days.
In the city of Pará de Minas, authorities were monitoring the Carioca hydroelectric dam amid concerns it could burst.
The civil defence authority said 145 out of the state's 853 municipalities had declared a state of emergency because of the severe weather. 
Meteorologists say the excessive rain was a result of a summer phenomenon - the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) - that causes heavy rainfall. Belo Horizonte saw 241.7mm (9.5 inches) of rain in 72 hours, when the average for the entire month of January is 329mm.
The bad weather is also a result of La Niña, a climate pattern in the Pacific Ocean that can affect weather worldwide.
Experts also say climate change is contributing to extreme weather events across the world.
In the last two months, heavy rains have affected other areas of Brazil, leaving dozens dead and thousands displaced, with the north-eastern state of Bahia one of the hardest hit.

French police have arrested a suspect over the unsolved 2012 murder of a British family and a French citizen in the Alps. 
Few details were given, but police said a man was in custody ""in order to do verifications regarding his schedule"". 
Saad al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal, Mrs al-Hilli's mother Suhaila al-Allaf and a cyclist, Sylvain Mollier, were found shot dead on a road near Lake Annecy.
The al-Hillis' two young daughters survived the attack.
Zeena, then aged four, was discovered hiding under her mother's body inside the family car.
Zainab, seven at the time, was found with serious head injuries after being shot and beaten.
The have since been given new identities and in 2020 were interviewed again to try to make progress on the case. 
French investigators have explored several theories, such as a family feud or Mr al-Hilli's work as a satellite engineer, as reasons for the attack but the case remains a mystery. 
A number of people have been arrested in connection with the deaths but no charges have ever been brought.
Investigators have said that Mollier had no link to the British family was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Boris Johnson is facing calls from senior Tories to stand down as prime minister after he admitted attending a drinks party during lockdown.
The PM apologised for the way he had handled the event in the Downing Street garden in 2020 and said he understood the public's ""rage"" over it. 
Cabinet members including deputy PM Dominic Raab rallied round Mr Johnson.
But Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross and senior backbencher William Wragg have called on him to quit.
Mr Ross, an MP and an MSP, said he had a ""difficult conversation"" with Mr Johnson after the PM's apology to MPs earlier on Wednesday.
He said he would write to the 1922 Committee - which organises Tory leadership contests - to register his lack of confidence in the PM.
""He is the prime minister, it is his government that put these rules in place, and he has to be held to account for his actions,"" he said.
If 54 backbench Conservative MPs send letters to the 1922 committee it will trigger a leadership challenge.
Ministers have urged MPs to wait for the outcome of an investigation into alleged Covid-rule breaking at Downing Street parties by senior civil servant Sue Gray, which they say will be published shortly.
But another backbencher William Wragg, who chairs an influential select committee, said the prime minister's position was ""untenable"".
""I don't think it should be left to the findings of a civil servant to determine the future of the prime minister and indeed who governs this country,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.

At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson sought to calm Tory anger about reports he had attended a ""bring your own booze"" party at the height of the first lockdown.
He admitted he was at the 20 May 2020 gathering for about 25 minutes, so that he could ""thank groups of staff"" for their hard work. 
He said: ""I believed implicitly that this was a work event.""
But he added: ""With hindsight I should have sent everyone back inside.
""I should have found some other way to thank them, and I should have recognised that - even if it could have been said technically to fall within the guidance - there would be millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that way.""
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the PM's defence was ""so ridiculous that it's actually offensive to the British public"" and he called on Mr Johnson ""to do the decent thing and resign"".
The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford called on Tory MPs to force the PM out - and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said he had to go.
Sir Ed has written to the Metropolitan Police to ask them to investigate Mr Johnson's attendance at the 20 May party.

The PM's statement was met with a mixed reaction from Tory MPs, with some saying he had sounded genuinely contrite.
Dan Poulter, who also works as a psychiatrist, said: ""I am pleased that the prime minister has apologised, but it's not much consolation to those of us who cared for patients on the frontline of the NHS and saw them die of Covid"".
Dominic Raab said the PM had ""given a very clear account"" of what had happened and had apologised for the ""perception"" of rule breaking.
He said detailed claims about the 20 May party were being investigated by Sue Gray and the prime minister would update the Commons once she had finished her work. 
Levelling-Up Secretary Michael Gove also backed the PM at a meeting of the 1922 committee.
Speaking to the BBC before the meeting of Tory backbenchers, Mr Gove said it was ""right for the PM to apologise"" but it was also ""important we all wait for Sue Gray's report to conclude"".
Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who has been visiting a pharmaceutical in the West Country, has not been available for interview.

203;South Africa's 'King Khoisan' arrested over cannabis plants at president's office;['2022-01-12T17:50:05.000Z'];['BBC News'];['bbc africa today podcast'];['arrested', 'ordered', 'dagga', 'south', 'africas', 'khoisan', 'presidents', 'statement', 'officer', 'public', 'fellow', 'mask', 'illegal', 'plants', 'cannabis', 'king', 'wear', 'plantation', 'office'];"
South African police have uprooted several cannabis plants growing near President Cyril Ramaphosa's office in Pretoria.
They belonged to activists from the indigenous Khoisan community, some of whom have camped in the area for three years. 
Their leader, who calls himself King Khoisan, clung on to a large cannabis plant as police dragged him away.
""Police... you have declared war,"" the AFP news agency quotes him as shouting.
""We have been here peacefully. We are coming for you,"" he continued.
He has since been arrested.
He and some fellow activists were detained for ""dealing in dagga [cannabis], illegal plantation and cultivation of dagga as well as failure to wear a face mask in public when ordered to do so by a police officer,"" a statement to AFP said. 
In 2018, the group set up camp on the green space outside the president's office, near a giant statue of Nelson Mandela, to campaign for the official recognition of their language.
King Khoisan's wife expressed anger about the incident in an interview with South Africa's IOL news site.
""I am very, very cross,"" Queen Cynthia said. ""The president don't want to come,"" to talk to them, she said. She told IOL the Khoisan people just want acknowledgement. 
People had been using the plants for medical reasons, such as cancer and high blood pressure, she continued. The cannabis had been planted in a vegetable garden.
The personal personal use of cannabis in private places was decriminalised in South African in 2018.
The Khoisan are South Africa's oldest inhabitants but now form a small minority in the country.

Boris Johnson offered a ""heartfelt"" apology for attending drinks in the Downing Street gardens during lockdown in 2020 - something he said he thought was a work event.
But will that apology and explanation wash with Conservative MPs?
Many of his cabinet colleagues rallied in support of the PM in the hours following the statement.
Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Health Secretary Sajid Javid praised him on Twitter for offering an apology, while Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove faced the 1922 committee of backbench MPs to remind them of Mr Johnson's plus points.
But earlier in the day, some others in the party who chose to speak publicly offered conditional support for their leader in his hour of need.
Minister Rachel Maclean said the PM's statement showed he ""recognised the anger and sense of injustice"" of the public, which were feelings she shared. 
""I also feel the same, as anybody would,"" she told BBC Two's Politics Live programme. ""I was following the rules. I couldn't see my own children. My own mother was in a nursing home [and] I couldn't see her.""
But Ms Maclean said the PM shouldn't resign, and that any conclusions - or punishments - needed to be decided by the independent inquiry into Westminster lockdown parties, led by senior civil servant Sue Gray.
Senior Tory Christopher Chope told the same programme he had ""never heard such an abject apology"" during his long years in Parliament, and he believed it was ""genuinely sincere"".
He said: ""I think the prime minister showed contrition and had realised he had done the wrong thing in not intervening at the time.
""So, I think when someone makes an apology like that, then reasonable people accept the apology.""
Sir Christopher also added the ""caveat"" implied by Ms Maclean, saying the party could revisit the issue of the prime minister's future depending on the outcome of Ms Gray's inquiry. 
But, he said, ""in the short-term"", the statement was ""a monumental relief... because we didn't think he'd be able to carry on if he didn't answer the basic question of if he was there"".  
That caveat seemed to be a running theme for those Tories speaking after Mr Johnson's Commons appearance.
Stephen Hammond told BBC Radio 4's World at One that he was pleased to hear ""an apology and some transparency"" from the prime minister, saying it was ""important he cleared up some of the speculation about his attendance"".
He said he would ""take his word"" that the PM thought the gathering was a work event.
But he said others would find it ""surprising"", adding: ""Many of my constituents quite rightly will be sitting here today feeling they've had a bit of an apology, but still feeling very let down.
""And like a number of people, I am still very very concerned that people in Downing Street thought it was acceptable to break the rules. 
""But I think the prime minister has at least earned the right for us to wait and see what Sue Gray says.""  
Others in the Tory ranks were less kind about the PM's performance. 
In fact, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Douglas Ross went as far as calling for his resignation - actually phoning Mr Johnson to tell him his position was untenable.  
The chair of the Public Affairs and Constitutional Affairs Committee, William Wragg, echoed his call, telling BBC Radio 4's PM that Tory MPs were ""frankly worn out of defending what is invariably indefensible"", and that ""for their sakes"" he should resign. 
And Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi - a long standing critic of Mr Johnson - said any minister, MP or member of staff at any Downing Street party must resign, ""no ifs no buts"".
She added: ""The rule of law is a fundamental value - the glue that hold us together as a nation. Once that is trashed by those in power the very essence of our democracy is at stake.""
While welcoming the apology, Tory MP Dan Poulter - who also works as a doctor - said it was ""not much consolation to those of us who cared for patients on the frontline of the NHS and saw them die of Covid"".
He said if the PM was ""found to have actively misled Parliament, or if he faces criminal sanction (or both), then his position would be untenable"".
Sir Roger Gale, who has already written a letter to the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers - the method for MPs to call for a leadership challenge - said that, politically speaking, ""the prime minister is a dead man walking"".
He told World at One that Mr Johnson had ""misled the House"" in December when claiming allegations of Covid rule-breaking parties were unfounded - breaking the ministerial code - and that he had left his MPs in ""an impossible situation"".
And there were MPs happy to make their critical views known to the BBC privately, with a senior Tory source saying the PM ""had lost what made him so successful with his party"".
Others said his performance at PMQs was ""weak"" and ""terrible"", while another said: ""It's growing and growing. He'll have to go.""
One Conservative MP told Nick Watt, the political editor at Newsnight, that: ""The PM's statement isn't enough. It won't do the trick. 
""He can usually find a small piece of Teflon to help him slip away from trouble. But I think he has finally run out of Teflon.""
Actions also sometimes speak louder then words too.
During the PM's stint at the dispatch box, the Conservative MPs sat behind his were subdued, avoiding the traditional cheers of support.
And they stuck firmly to questions about local projects, like bus routes, and even washing machines.
But remember, between the calls for Mr Johnson to quit and others offering tentative support, the majority of the 360 Tory MPs in Parliament are keeping quiet and could fall into either camp. 
The response to Mr Johnson from the opposition was perhaps unsurprising, with no fewer than eight MPs using PMQs to call for his resignation.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called the prime minister ""a pathetic spectacle of a man who has run out of road"", the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said he had ""betrayed the nation's trust"", and Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called it a ""shameful attempt"" at an apology. 
Other MPs joined the vocal outcry, with Green MP Caroline Lucas accusing Mr Johnson of only saying sorry to ""save his skin"", while Labour's Jess Philips said: ""He's not sorry, he's sorry he got caught.""
But it is the Conservative Party that will decide Mr Johnson's future, and the conclusions of those MPs which will seal his fate.

205;Downing Street parties: The unanswered questions;['2022-01-12T15:17:03.000Z'];['By Jennifer Scott'];['conservative party', 'boris johnson'];['street', 'downing', 'mr', 'lockdown', 'list', 'garden', 'staff', 'questions', 'johnson', 'parties', 'party', 'unanswered', 'told'];"
Boris Johnson has said he did attend an event in the No 10 garden during the first lockdown in May 2020, after previously refusing to comment on it.
He told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions that the drinks in the Downing Street garden were ""technically within the rules"" but he should have realised how it would look to the public.
Senior civil servant Sue Gray is investigating whether Covid rules were broken at a series of lockdown get-togethers of No 10 staff and residents.
But what questions face her, and the prime minister?
An email from Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, inviting people to ""make the most of the lovely weather"", was sent to a distribution list of around 100 people.
But the full list of recipients has not been published.
So why does it matter who was on the list? 
Well, the names will show who knew about the party taking place. 
Downing Street has said Mr Johnson did not see the email inviting staff to ""socially distanced drinks"" on 20 May 2020.
But many Westminster-watchers are sceptical that an email from the principal private secretary - or PPS - could have gone out without Mr Johnson knowing about it. 
On Tuesday, Caroline Slocock, who worked in the private offices of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, told BBC Radio 4 it was ""inconceivable"" the PM wasn't aware of such an invite, especially one from a close staff member using the word ""we"". 
Hannah White,  of the Institute for Government think tank - a former secretary to the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said she believed the PM ""had to have"" known about the event. 
The next step is to find out who chose to go to the gathering, despite the lockdown that was in force at the time in England.
The BBC has been told from sources at the garden drinks that around 30 people were present, alongside the PM and his wife. 
Who went to the party will be key for the same reason as the invite list, showing who knew about the event.
But more importantly, the attendee list will show who decided to break the rules - and perhaps the law - individually.
The party on 20 May 2020 is far from the only allegation of a party in Westminster during the pandemic. 
At least 10 alleged gatherings, in Downing Street or government departments, have come to light so far.
For a full list of what we know, click here.
Two of these are alleged to have taken place during the first lockdown in 2020.
The first on, 15 May, pictured in the Guardian, with the PM and his wife sharing wine and cheese with staff, was claimed to be a work meeting.
The second, on 20 May, was the ""bring your own booze"" garden party, was revealed by the PM's former aide Dominic Cummings, last Friday. 
In November of the same year, there are claims the PM's wife, Carrie Johnson, held a party in the Johnsons' Downing Street flat, as well as allegations staff held a leaving do for a staff member, with Mr Johnson making a speech.
And in December, there were said to be festive quizzes and Christmas parties in several locations across Whitehall.
One was attended by the PM virtually, but he insisted all the guidance was followed to the letter.

206;RAF man set to unleash Virgin Orbit space rocket over Pacific;['2022-01-13T00:43:51.000Z'];['Jonathan Amos'];['richard branson', 'newquay', 'aerospace', 'space exploration', 'california'];['pacific', 'way', 'space', 'upcoming', 'rocket', 'satellites', 'raf', 'orbit', 'man', 'right', 'sending', 'simulator', 'seat', 'set', 'virgin', 'stannys', 'unleash', 'told'];"
RAF pilot Matthew Stannard will be at the controls of a jumbo jet on Thursday when it launches a rocket to space from out over the Pacific Ocean.
The airman is currently seconded to Sir Richard Branson's satellite launch company, Virgin Orbit, which will be attempting to loft seven spacecraft.
""Stanny"", as he's known, is more accustomed to firing missiles from Tornado and Typhoon fighter jets.
Unleashing a 21m (70ft) space booster will be a new experience.
""Stanny has been a wonderful addition to our team. As you'd expect given his background with the RAF, he brings a bright intellect, incredible attention to detail, and an excellent experience base, in addition to his world-class piloting skills,"" said Virgin Orbit chief operating officer Tony Gingiss. 
""Stanny's been deeply involved in all of our planning, and after flying on our previous mission and logging many hours in the simulator, he will be in the right seat for our upcoming 'Above the Clouds' flight, releasing our LauncherOne rocket at the right time, sending our customers' satellites on their way to orbit,"" the executive told BBC News.
The UK Ministry of Defence anticipates using Virgin Orbit to launch military satellites in the future, and is building a pool of experience in advance of this happening.
Thursday's mission will be the third overall for British entrepreneur Sir Richard's Long Beach, California-based company.
His 747-and-LauncherOne system has previously put up 19 satellites. The seven on the latest manifest includes one manufactured in Glasgow by Spire Global, which tracks weather conditions from orbit, along with ship and plane movements.
Flt Lt Stannard is scheduled to get matters under way at roughly 12:30 US West Coast time (20:30 GMT).
He'll fly out over the Pacific with the rocket tucked neatly under the left wing of the former Virgin Atlantic jumbo.
About an hour after take-off, at an altitude of 35,000ft (10km), the liquid-fuelled booster will be unlatched and go into a freefall.
Roughly four seconds later, as Flt Lt Stannard banks his 747 hard to the right, LauncherOne will ignite its first-stage engine to begin the climb to orbit.
Virgin Orbit wants to run six space missions this year, with two of these planned to operate out of Newquay Airport in Cornwall.
The first of these UK events could happen as early as June or July, although much will depend on how quickly licensing paperwork goes through the UK's Civil Aviation Authority. The CAA's paramount concern is safety and it won't let any launch proceed until it's satisfied all contingencies are covered. 
The CAA has 35 staff to assess the technical details of applications. A licence to operate a spaceport is expected to take six to 12 months to process; a licence to operate a rocket system will take longer at nine to 18 months.
The CAA told the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee on Wednesday that so far it was dealing with four formally submitted licensing applications (others from a range of potential spaceport/rocket operators are at a pre-application stage).
However, when asked whether this meant a UK launch was likely this year, the authority's policy director Tim Johnson refused to be drawn.
""We absolutely share the government's enthusiasm, and industry's enthusiasm, and commitment to this task. We're open for business, we're processing applications; the key driver of the timetable will be the quality of the applications (and) the evidence presented,"" he told MPs.
""We will exercise our duties in the most timely way possible.""

207;China and Taiwan: A really simple guide to a growing conflict;['2022-01-12T14:25:41.000Z'];['By David Brown'];['china', 'taiwan'];['power', 'growing', 'pacific', 'military', 'western', 'guide', 'threaten', 'suggest', 'project', 'simple', 'possibly', 'taiwan', 'really', 'china', 'region', 'conflict'];"
Pressure between China and Taiwan has been building, with the past year seeing a record number of Chinese warplane incursions sent into Taiwan's air defence zone. 
At the heart of this is the issue of reunification. 
China's President Xi Jinping has said ""reunification"" with Taiwan ""must be fulfilled"" - and has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve this. 
China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be part of the country again. 
However, Taiwan sees itself as an independent country, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders. 
Taiwan is an island, roughly 100 miles from the coast of south east China.
It sits in the so-called ""first island chain"", which includes a list of US-friendly territories that are crucial to US foreign policy. 
If China was to take over Taiwan, some western experts suggest it could be freer to project power in the western Pacific region and could possibly even threaten US military bases as far away as Guam and Hawaii.
But China insists that its intentions are purely peaceful.
The split between the two came about after World War Two, when there was fighting in mainland China between nationalist government forces and the Chinese Communist Party.
The communists won in 1949, and their leader, Mao Zedong, took control in Beijing.
Meanwhile, the nationalist party - known as the Kuomintang - fled to nearby Taiwan.
The Kuomintang has been one of Taiwan's most prominent political parties ever since - ruling the island for a significant part of its history. 
Currently, only 13 countries (plus the Vatican) recognise Taiwan as a sovereign country.
China exerts considerable diplomatic pressure on other countries not to recognise Taiwan, or to do anything which implies recognition.
Taiwan's defence minister has said relations with China are the worst they have been for 40 years. 
China could attempt to bring about reunification by non-military means such as strengthening economic ties.
But in any military confrontation, China's armed forces would dwarf those of Taiwan. 
China spends more than any country except the US on defence and could draw on a huge range of capabilities, from naval power to missile technology, aircraft and cyber attacks.
Much of China's military power is focused elsewhere but, in overall terms of active duty personnel for example, there is a huge imbalance between the two sides.
In an open conflict, some western experts predict that Taiwan could at best aim to slow a Chinese attack, try to prevent a shore landing by Chinese amphibious forces, and mount guerrilla strikes whilst waiting for outside help.
That help could come from the US which sells arms to Taiwan, though Washington has a formal policy of ""strategic ambiguity"". 
In other words, the US is deliberately unclear about whether or how it would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack.
Diplomatically, the US currently sticks to the ""One-China"" policy, which recognises only one Chinese government - in Beijing - and has formal ties with China rather than Taiwan.
In 2021, China appeared to ramp up pressure by sending military aircraft into Taiwan's Air Defence Zone, a self-declared area where foreign aircraft are identified, monitored, and controlled in the interests of national security.
Taiwan made data on plane incursions public in 2020.
The numbers of aircraft reported peaked in October 2021, with 56 incursions in a single day. 
Taiwan's economy is hugely important.
Much of the world's everyday electronic equipment - from phones to laptops, watches and games consoles - is powered by computer chips made in Taiwan.
By one measure, a single Taiwanese company - the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or TSMC - has over half of the world's market.
TSMC is a so-called ""foundry"" - a company which makes chips designed by consumer and military customers. It is a vast industry, worth almost $100bn (£730bn) in 2021.
A Chinese takeover in Taiwan could give Beijing some control over one of the world's most important industries.
Despite the recent tensions between China and Taiwan, research suggests that many Taiwanese people are relatively untroubled.
In October the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation asked people whether they thought that there would, eventually, be war with China.  
Almost two thirds (64.3%) replied that they did not.
Separate research indicates that most people in Taiwan identify as Taiwanese - embracing a distinctly different identity. 
Surveys conducted by the National Chengchi University since the early 1990s indicate that the proportion of people who identify as Chinese, or both Chinese and Taiwanese, has fallen and that most people consider themselves as Taiwanese.

208;The people using YouTube to pay for their French chateau;['2022-01-13T00:11:11.000Z'];['By Kate Stanton'];['housing', 'france', 'housing market'];['tv', 'chateau', 'french', 'pay', 'wave', 'youtube', 'sporadically', 'started', 'social', 'renovation', 'video', 'talking', 'using'];"
Stephanie Jarvis credits YouTube with saving her vast French chateau.
She had bought the 40-room, 16th Century home back in 2005 after pooling resources with a friend.
Such French castles were relatively cheap at the time, so between them they were able to buy one for £590,000, raising the money by selling both of their two-bedroom London flats.
The plan was to turn the property - Chateau de Lalande, in the Centre-Val de Loire region of northern France - into a bed and breakfast, and hire it out for events.
However, Ms Jarvis admits that she didn't factor in just how expensive it would be to pay for the upkeep of such a huge, old building. ""I didn't realise how much money it would take to run,"" says the 50-year-old.
So, by the start of 2020, the chateau business had yet to make a profit. And then the Covid-19 pandemic arrived, and France went into lockdown.
""It was going to be the first year that we were in profit for the bed and breakfast, but everything had been cancelled,"" she says. ""I had no money coming in, and nothing to do.""
Then Ms Jarvis had a brain wave. Since 2018 she had been sporadically posting video blogs about her life at the castle up on social media platform, YouTube, under the channel name, The Chateau Diaries. She had started to do this after appearing in a TV renovation show, called Escape to the Chateau DIY, and found that she liked the experience of talking to the camera about her home.
With the pandemic shutting down everything else, Ms Jarvis decided that she'd now make and publish such videos on a daily basic ""and see how it goes"".
To her surprise, her YouTube channel soared in popularity, going up from 10,000 subscribers in 2019 to 173,000 today.
This meant that the money she made from the advertisements on her videos jumped from a few hundred euros to many thousands.
""It escalated so fast, it was unbelievable,"" she says. ""I think a lot of people were finding themselves in quarantine, and wanting to see how other people were living through it.""
""The channel also gives people this hope that maybe they don't need to follow a traditional path, and then can still make something happen with their lives.""
Ms Jarvis is now able to use the revenue from YouTube, along with the renewed income from the bed and breakfast, to pay four staff to work at the castle.
She also now gets additional funds from a Patreon account that she set up last year. Patreon is an online subscription platform that allows Ms Jarvis' subscribers to pay to view exclusive, extra video content. This is now said to make about £24,000 per month.
Another couple now making YouTube videos about life owning a French chateau are British designer Anna Mayrhofer and her Italian filmmaker husband Philipp.
They purchased their 18th Century Chateau Le Fleur, in Normandy, in 2019, using money from the sale of their Parisian apartment. Like Ms Jarvis, they also underestimated the total cost of the renovations that the property would need.
The couple started to post videos at the end of 2020, hoping it would serve as a marketing tool for when the pandemic ended and they could open their bed and breakfast.
Their YouTube channel - How To Renovate A Chateau (Without Killing Your Partner) - now has 133,000 subscribers, and brings in regular advertising revenue.
""It never occurred to us that this could become an income stream as important as the guesthouse,"" says Mr Mayrhofer.  ""But we get more and more advertising money, and it started to become almost like a salary.""
The couple also launched a Patreon account, which has more than 750 subscribers paying from about £4.50-17.50 per month. Mr Mayrhofer says he and Anna are now so busy making video content it might make more financial sense to slow down the guesthouse side of their business. 
""For now, we enjoy [making videos]. It encourages us, and it's fun to do,"" he says. 
Paris-based estate agent, Patrice Besse, specialises in selling chateaux dotted across France. He says that one in relatively good condition now costs between €800,000 ($900,000; £670,000) and €1,500,000. Cheaper properties require more restoration work, and therefore might end up costing more in the long term.
He cautions that buying a French chateau should not generally be seen as a way to make money. ""Any buyer knows that owning a chateau will not make you rich.""
Instead, he says that owning a chateau is a ""way of life"", and that many buyers care less about the return on their investment, and more about the emotional journey of restoring an old property and the dream of living in one.
Yet he adds that per square metre ""chateaux are the cheapest real estate in France"", especially when compared to the cost of a Parisian apartment. And demand has risen as a result of the pandemic meaning that people want to leave France's big cities.
Fellow estate agent Christophe Chassin adds that the price of French chateaux has increased since the start of the pandemic, due to high demand.
New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast.
""We made a lot of sales over the past 12 months,"" says Mr Chassin, who sells mostly to overseas clients from the UK, US, Australia and South America. ""And we are struggling to renew our portfolio of properties.""
One person who bought a French chateau from Mr Chassin over the past year is American, Julia Leach.
The 30-year-old was inspired to purchase one after becoming an avid viewer of Ms Jarvis' The Chateau Diaries while she lived in New York.
""The contrast was stark between the hustle and work culture I was immersed in, and the slower pace of life of Stephanie's videos pulled at my heart,"" says Ms Leach, who shared Jarvis' videos with her family in California. 
So in April 2021, Ms Leach, her partner, sister and their parents pooled their financial resources to buy the 12-bedroom, 13th-Century Chateau du Puy Vidal in Charente, southwest France, for €2.2m (£1.8m).
Ms Leach, who previously worked in film and television production, plans to turn the castle into a studio facility for filmmakers. And she naturally has also set up a YouTube channel - Lady of the Chateau Productions - which already has 13,000 subscribers.
Back at Chateau de Lalande, Ms Jarvis says she can spend 40-60 hours a week filming and editing videos. ""There's nothing else I'd rather be doing,"" she says. ""I feel more tied to the chateau, but in a really positive way.""

Boris Johnson is facing calls from senior Tories to resign after he admitted attending a drinks party during lockdown.
The prime minister apologised for the way he handled the event in the Downing Street garden in May 2020 and said he understood the public's ""rage"" over it. 
Cabinet members including deputy PM Dominic Raab rallied round Mr Johnson.
But Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross and MPs William Wragg, Caroline Nokes and Roger urged him to go.
Mr Ross, an MP and a Member of the Scottish Parliament, said he had had a ""difficult conversation"" with Mr Johnson after he apologised on Wednesday in the House of Commons.
He said he would write to the 1922 Committee, which organises Conservative leadership contests, to register his lack of confidence in the prime minister.
""He is the prime minister. It is his government that put these rules in place, and he has to be held to account for his actions,"" Mr Ross said.
Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said those calling for Mr Johnson were ""people who are always unhappy"" and dismissed Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross as ""quite a lightweight figure"".
Conservative MP Andrew Percy criticised Mr Rees-Mogg, saying: ""As someone who apparently loves the Union, his personal attack on Douglas... is a gift to the petty nationalists in the SNP who want to break this country up.""

A minimum of 54 Conservative MPs must send letters to the committee in order to trigger a leadership challenge.
The drinks gathering, held on 20 May 2020 and described in the invitation as ""socially distanced"", was attended by around 30 people, who were invited to bring their own alcohol. Food, including sausage rolls and crisps, was reportedly laid out on trestle tables,
Mr Johnson admitted at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday that he had joined colleagues at the event for around 25 minutes to ""thank groups of staff"" for their hard work during the pandemic, but had ""believed implicitly that this was a work event"".
He added: ""With hindsight I should have sent everyone back inside. I should have found some other way to thank them, and I should have recognised that - even if it could have been said technically to fall within the guidance - there would be millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that way.""
Ministers have urged MPs to wait for the outcome of an investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray into alleged Covid-rule breaking at Downing Street parties, which is expected be published next week.
Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told BBC Breakfast: ""You've got to let these investigations get to the full details and the full facts.""
He said the prime minister recognised the ""frustration, anger and upset"" about what people perceived to be happening at Downing Street, adding he ""absolutely"" supported his leadership.
This video can not be played
But Mr Wragg, a backbench MP who chairs an influential select committee, called the prime minister's position ""untenable"".
""I don't think it should be left to the findings of a civil servant to determine the future of the prime minister and indeed who governs this country,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.
And fellow Tory Caroline Nokes, who chairs another Commons committee, said the prime minister should resign now as he was ""damaging the entire Conservative brand"".
The former minister, who has previously been critical of Mr Johnson's leadership, told ITV's Robert Peston: ""Regretfully, he looks like a liability. And I think he either goes now, or he goes in three years' time at a general election.""
The prime minister's admission and apology in the Commons likely bought him a little time.
A pause until the official inquiry into what parties did or didn't take place in Downing Street is published, in perhaps a week or so.
But for many on his own side, Boris Johnson has already lost the benefit of the doubt.
Growing numbers of his own MPs want him out, discussing frantically how and when his exit could take place.

At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson's explanation for his attendance at the drinks gathering was ""so ridiculous that it's actually offensive to the British public"" and he called on Mr Johnson ""to do the decent thing and resign"".
The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, called on Tory MPs to force the prime minister out.
And Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who has asked the Metropolitan Police to investigate Mr Johnson's attendance at the drinks, said he had to go.

The prime minister's statement was met with a mixed reaction from Conservative MPs, with Dan Poulter saying it was ""not much consolation"" for those who had worked on the frontline in the NHS. 
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Chancellor Rishi Sunak - both tipped as potential successors to Mr Johnson as leader - tweeted their support on Wednesday evening. 
Ms Truss said she stood behind the prime minister ""100%"", while Mr Sunak said Mr Johnson had been ""right to apologise"", adding that he supported the PM's call for ""patience"" while Ms Gray completed her investigation.
A poll for The Times by YouGov, carried out before Mr Johnson's apology at Prime Minister's Questions, gave Labour at a 10-point lead over the Conservatives - the party's biggest lead since December 2013.

Cabinet ministers have pledged their support for Boris Johnson, as he faces calls to resign after admitting attending a drinks party in lockdown.
Meanwhile, the PM cancelled a visit to Lancashire after a family member tested positive for coronavirus.
Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross and other senior backbenchers have urged the PM to stand down.
But cabinet ministers have urged MPs to wait for the outcome of an inquiry into alleged Covid-rule breaking at No 10.
And Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed Mr Ross as a ""lightweight"".

Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab also backed the PM, saying he had given a ""very clear account"" of what happened.

In the Commons, Mr Rees-Mogg said a future full inquiry into the pandemic would look at whether Covid restrictions had been ""proportionate"" or ""too hard on people"".
He also said: ""I think everybody understands, on all sides of the House, that people were obeying the rules, and these rules were very hard for people to obey.""
Mr Johnson's visit on Thursday to the vaccination clinic in Lancashire was cancelled, and he will follow official guidance, including taking daily tests and limiting contact with other people, a Downing Street spokesperson said.
Mr Johnson admitted at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday that he had joined colleagues for drinks in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020 for around 25 minutes, to ""thank groups of staff"" for their hard work during the pandemic, but had ""believed implicitly that this was a work event"".

""I should have found some other way to thank them, and I should have recognised that - even if it could have been said technically to fall within the guidance - there would be millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that way.""
The chancellor tweeted his support for Boris Johnson eight hours after the prime minister's apology at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.
And unlike other senior ministers, Rishi Sunak was not at Mr Johnson's side in the Commons.
Some newspapers have interpreted the timing and content of his message of support as lukewarm backing for his boss and neighbour in Downing Street.
Sources close to the chancellor point out the language he used about waiting for the report into lockdown-busting parties in Whitehall is almost identical to the messages posted by other cabinet ministers.
A peek at his diary also reveals a man with a genuinely busy day, which included a trip to Devon in the morning and a meeting with the prime minister in the evening, then more meetings with MPs worried about energy bills.
But Mr Sunak is seen as one of the favourites to succeed Boris Johnson, if and when he goes, even though the chancellor himself has said he is not interested in the top job.
The chancellor's colleagues may be frustrated with the media's obsession with this, but they'll just have to live with the fact that a leadership contender always attracts more rune-reading than a lower profile cabinet minister.
And supporters of the prime minister have started gently putting the pressure on the Chancellor to speak out on other big issues facing the country.
""Problems with the cost of living? I'd have thought that was one for your finance minister, wouldn't you?"" said one advisor to a Johnson ally.   
Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP have called on the prime minister to resign, claiming he broke Covid rules brought in by his own government.
Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner has written to all members of the cabinet, asking whether they attended any gatherings during lockdown.
""It is time to finally come clean and tell us exactly what happened at the heart of government when the rest of us were following the rules,"" she said.
Mr Johnson's statement and apology received a mixed reaction among Conservatives, with Dan Poulter saying it was ""not much consolation"" for those who had worked on the frontline in the NHS.

A Moroccan university professor accused of giving students good grades in return for sexual favours has been sentenced to two years in prison.
This is the first verdict in a string of high-profile sexual harassment cases at universities in Morocco. 
The economics lecturer at Hassan I University in Settat city was convicted of indecent behaviour, sexual harassment and violence.
Four more academics are due to appear in court later as part of the scandal.
The story came to light in September through the leaking on social media of messages that are said to have been between the lecturers and students.  
The allegations caused anger in Morocco but not surprise - a string of such scandals have tarnished the reputation of Moroccan universities in recent years.
The current case was different in that it was brought to court - most reported incidents do not lead to prosecutions.
Rights groups say this is symptomatic of a society in which sexual violence remains widespread and many women do not feel confident reporting their experiences because of concerns over possible reprisals or the perceived damage to their reputation and that of their family.

214;Chinese agent infiltrating Parliament, MI5 warns;['2022-01-13T15:06:06.000Z'];['BBC News'];['mi5', 'china', 'uk parliament'];['chinese', 'agent', 'way', 'ongoing', 'best', 'going', 'case', 'public', 'result', 'believe', 'warns', 'risk', 'parliament', 'infiltrating', 'disrupting', 'mi5'];"
MI5 has issued a rare warning to MPs that a Chinese agent has infiltrated Parliament to interfere in UK politics.
An alert from the security service said Christine Ching Kui Lee ""established links"" for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with current and aspiring MPs.
She then gave donations to politicians, with funding coming from foreign nationals in China and Hong Kong. 
It comes after a ""significant, long-running"" investigation by MI5, Whitehall sources told the BBC. 
The security service said anyone contacted by Ms Lee should be ""mindful of her affiliation"" and its ""remit to advance the CCP's agenda"".
Conservative MP and former party leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, brought up the alert in the Commons, confirming it had been emailed out to MPs by the Speaker.
He said it was ""a matter of grave concern"", calling for Ms Lee to be deported and demanding the government make a statement to the House.
Former defence minister Tobias Ellwood also called for a statement in the Commons, adding: ""This is the sort grey-zone interference we now anticipate and expect from China.
""But the fact that it's happened to this Parliament, there must be a sense of urgency from this government.""
Issuing an alert about an individual is an unusual move for MI5. 
It signals that their long-running investigation had led them to become sufficiently concerned that they felt they had to act now. 
We have heard about concerns over Russian influence in the past but China, British intelligence officials say, has now become their top priority.
The allegation here is interference - covertly gaining influence - and not espionage (stealing secrets).
And one concern from security officials is that there are not the laws in place to be able to tackle interference.
As a result, they sometimes believe that going public - as they have done in this case - is the best way of disrupting any ongoing risk.
According to the alert, Ms Lee claimed her involvement with Parliament had been to ""represent the UK Chinese and increase diversity"".
But MI5 said that activity ""had been undertaken in covert coordination with the United Front Work Department [of the CCP], with funding provided by foreign nationals located in China and Hong Kong"".
The UFWD is alleged to be seeking to ""cultivate relations"" with ""influential figures"" to ensure the UK political landscape is favourable to the CCP and to challenge those that raise concerns about the party, including over human rights.
The security service said Ms Lee had ""extensive engagement with individuals across the UK political spectrum"", including the now disbanded All Party Parliamentary Group called Chinese in Britain.
But they warned Ms Lee ""may aspire to establish APPGs [parliamentary groups] to further the CCP's agenda"".

Four more US diplomats working in Geneva and Paris have fallen ill with a suspected neurological illness known as ""Havana syndrome"", US media report. 
Three diplomats became sick in the Swiss city and one in the French capital last summer, with some 200 people affected over five years.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the American government was working to get to the bottom of the mystery.
There are fears an adversary may have targeted diplomats with microwaves. 
Mr Blinken said the issue had been raised with Russia but no determination had been made. 
Havana syndrome first emerged in Cuba in 2016 and has affected US diplomats, spies, officials and family members, as well as a number of Canadian diplomatic staff deployed in Cuba. 
Some of the people who experienced the syndrome were left with dizziness and fatigue for months. 
The latest cases include one person who was evacuated from Switzerland to the US for treatment, media reports say.
Mr Blinken told MSNBC in an interview that he had met state department employees around the world who had described their illnesses and how their lives had been disrupted.
People, he said, had been ""directly and powerfully affected"".
""To date, we don't know exactly what's happened and we don't know exactly who is responsible,"" he told the broadcaster.
""We are working overtime across the entire government to get to the bottom of what happened, who's responsible,"" he said.
Russia, China and the US itself are all said to have researched microwaves for military purposes but  Moscow has dismissed accusations it used ""microwave weapons"" against US missions as ""fanciful hypotheses"".
A more innocent, but also unproven, theory is that those who got sick suffered from a mass condition brought on by some stressful underlying situation.

The Duke of York's military titles and royal patronages have been returned to the Queen, Buckingham Palace has announced.
Prince Andrew will also stop using the style His Royal Highness in an official capacity, a royal source added.
The duke's roles will be distributed among members of the Royal Family.
It comes as he faces a civil case in the US over claims he sexually assaulted a woman when she was 17, which he has consistently denied.
A judge ruled on Wednesday that the case brought by Virginia Giuffre could continue, after he tried to have it dismissed.
Buckingham Palace said in a statement: ""With the Queen's approval and agreement, the Duke of York's military affiliations and Royal patronages have been returned to the Queen.
""The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.""

217;Ashling Murphy: Victim did not know her killer, detectives believe;['2022-01-13T17:36:46.000Z'];['BBC News'];['republic of ireland'];['killer', 'know', 'detectives', 'murphy', 'síochána', 'justice', 'victim', 'truly', 'believe', 'crime', 'young', 'killed', 'shocking', 'woman', 'ashling', 'thoughts', 'tonight'];"
A young teacher who was murdered in Tullamore, County Offaly, is not believed to have known her killer, gardaí (Irish police) have said.
Ashling Murphy, 23, was attacked on the banks of the Grand Canal outside the town on Wednesday afternoon and she died at the scene.
Her former teachers have paid tributes, calling her murder ""senseless"".
Gardaí said they believed she was killed by one man who acted alone.  A 40-year-old man remains under arrest.
A team of more than 50 gardaí have been assigned to the murder investigation and an incident room has been set up in Tullamore. 
""No stone will be left unturned in bringing the perpetrator of this crime to justice,"" said Supt Eamonn Curley.

In a press conference from the scene, he said Ms Murphy sustained serious injuries ""consistent with an assault"".
A post mortem examination has been carried out to determine the exact cause of her death, but gardaí said on Thursday evening that the results were not being released ""for operational reasons"".
Detectives have appealed for information about a Falcon Storm mountain bike.
They released a photo of the bike, which they said had ""straight handlebars and distinctive yellow/green front forks"".
They said they also still want to hear from anyone who was near the scene of the murder at Cappincur, Tullamore, on Wednesday afternoon.
Gardaí responded to the incident following a call from a member of the public at about 16:00 local time and found Ms Murphy with serious injuries.
She was given medical attention but could not be saved.
Ms Murphy worked at Durrow National School and she was also a talented musician and member of the National Folk Orchestra of Ireland.
She taught 28 pupils in the 1st class (age six to seven) at the school and had joined the staff team in March 2021.
Her principal James Hogan told Virgin Media News that the school community was ""devastated and numb"".
He paid tribute to her as a ""fantastic, beautiful, an extraordinary sportsperson, Irish musician, choral conductor and an inspiration"".
He said she was referred to as the ""shining light"" whose face lit up the room when she came into it and said the school was working to support staff and students. 
Ms Murphy's death has also shocked the world of Irish traditional music, according to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann (Gathering of Musicians of Ireland).
""Ashling was among the finest exponents of the concertina and fiddle and was also learning the uilleann pipes,"" the group said in a statement.
""She was an exceptionally talented young lady who made an unforgettable impression on all who had the good fortune to know her.""
It said she had been a member of the Comhaltas National Folk Orchestra of Ireland since 2017 and performed with them during visit of Pope Francis to Ireland in 2018.
Tributes have also been paid by her former teachers in her home town of Tullamore and by staff at Mary Immaculate College (MIC) in Limerick, from where she graduated very recently.
""The entire MIC community is heartbroken and shocked to the core to hear of the tragic and senseless killing of Ashling Murphy who graduated from MIC only three months ago,"" said its president Eugene Wall.
""Our heartfelt sympathy go out to her family, friends, colleagues and pupils. RIP Ashling.
Ms Murphy was attacked between Boland Lough and Digby's bridge on the canal bank.
According to RTÉ News she was exercising in the area when she was assaulted and the suspect fled when two women came across the attack.
Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin said the ""entire country is devastated and shocked by the violent and barbaric killing"".
""There is no place in our society for violence, particularly violence against women. It cannot and will not be tolerated,"" he added. 
Justice Minister Helen McEntee described Ms Murphy's murder as a ""truly shocking crime"".
Ms McEntee urged anyone with information about the incident to come forward.
The Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) said the attack was an ""appalling tragedy"" and it offered its condolences to Ms Murphy's family and friends.  
""For such an appalling tragedy to befall a young woman, who only recently began her teaching career, adds to the profound sense of loss and grief felt,"" it said.

219;Secret audio sheds light on toppled dictator’s frantic last hours;['2022-01-14T00:10:44.000Z'];['By Emir Nader'];['tunisia'];['sheds', 'secret', 'toppled', 'statements', 'hours', 'minister', 'recollection', 'frantic', 'dictators', 'spoken', 'speakers', 'previous', 'raise', 'plane', 'president', 'matching', 'light', 'audio'];"
The BBC has obtained extraordinary recordings which we believe to be of phone calls made by a former Middle East dictator, Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, as he flew out of the country in 2011. These final moments show how his authority crumbled, sealing the fate of his 23-year dictatorship and sparking the region's wave of pro-democracy 'Arab Spring' uprisings.
The recordings have been forensically analysed by audio experts who found no evidence of tampering or manipulation. Ben Ali died in exile in 2019, but the BBC has also played these recordings to people who know the individuals concerned, and they believe the voices to be genuine, further supporting the authenticity of the recordings. However some of the people concerned strongly dispute their veracity.
If genuine, the recordings give an incredible insight into the change in Ben Ali's mood in the last 48 hours of his regime, as he slowly begins to grasp the true impact of protests rocking his feared police state. 
The recordings - extracts of which are included below - begin on the evening of 13 January 2011. The first is a call to a close confidant, believed to be Tarak Ben Ammar, a successful media tycoon who is known for encouraging director George Lucas to film the first Star Wars movie in Tunisia. Earlier that day Ben Ali had made a televised speech to the nation, in an attempt to quash the momentum of mass demonstrations.
Widespread discontent at economic hardship and decades of autocratic rule and corruption had erupted weeks earlier after a young street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, set fire to himself when officials stopped him selling produce in the town of Sidi Bouzid. By 13 January about 100 people had died in the protests, which were now overwhelming the streets of the capital. 
But Ben Ali sounds reassured when Ben Ammar appears to lavish him with praise. 
""You were wonderful, this is the Ben Ali that we've been waiting for!"" says Ben Ammar in the recording. 
Ben Ali is self-deprecating, saying his speech lacked fluency, but his confidant reassures him. 
""Not at all… It's a historic comeback. You're a man of the people. You speak their language,"" his friend says. 
This video can not be played
Ben Ali laughs with what sounds like relief. But the speech made to the Tunisian public clearly isn't enough. The next day, protests intensify and threaten to overrun the Ministry of Interior. Arrangements are made for Ben Ali's family to get on a flight out of the country for their own safety - headed to Saudi Arabia - and Ben Ali is then persuaded to escort them, he says. 
The content and the timing of the next recordings place Ben Ali on this flight. 
He can be heard making a series of increasingly frantic calls to three people - believed to be his defence minister, the chief of the army, and a close confidant - Kamel Eltaief.
He begins by asking someone we understand to be Minister of Defence Ridha Grira about the situation on the ground back in Tunisia. Grira breaks it to him that an interim president is now in place. Ben Ali asks Grira to repeat this information three times, before responding that he will be back in the country ""in a few hours"". 
He then calls a man the BBC believes to be close confidant Kamel Eltaief. Ben Ali tells Eltaief that the defence minister has reassured him events are under control. 
This video can not be played
Eltaief bluntly corrects this assumption.
""No, no, no. The situation is changing rapidly and the army isn't enough,"" his friend tells him. 
Ben Ali interrupts him to ask: ""Do you advise me to come back now or not?"" He has to repeat the question three more times before Eltaief properly responds. 
""Things aren't good,"" Eltaief finally replies. 
Ben Ali then makes a call to who we believe to be the chief of the army, General Rachid Ammar. Ammar doesn't appear to recognise the voice on the end of the line. ""I'm the president,"" Ben Ali has to tell him.
Ammar reassures him that ""everything is ok"". Again, Ben Ali poses the same question he asked Eltaief - should he return to Tunisia now? Rachid tells him it would be better for him to ""wait a while"".
""When we see that you can come back, we'll let you know, Mr President,"" Ammar tells Ben Ali. 
He calls his defence minister once more, again asking if he should return home, and this time Grira is more forthright, telling Ben Ali that he ""cannot guarantee his safety"" if he does so. 
Just after midnight, President Ben Ali's plane lands in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He orders the pilot to prepare for his return trip, and he and his family are escorted to the King Faisal Palace Guest House. 
But the pilot disobeys the order. He abandons Ben Ali and flies back to Tunisia.
Waking in Saudi Arabia the next morning, Ben Ali rings his defence minister again. Grira admits the administration is not in control of what is happening on the streets. He tells Ben Ali that there is even talk of a coup. Ben Ali dismisses this as the action of ""Islamists"", before once more talking about returning home. 
This video can not be played
Grira now seems to attempt to level with his boss. 
""There's anger on the streets in a way that I cannot describe,"" Grira says. He seems keen to be clear with the president, adding: ""So that you cannot say that I misled you, and the decision is yours.""
Ben Ali tries to defend his reputation. ""What have I done to the street? I served it.""                        
""I'm giving you the situation, not an explanation"" Grira replies. 
Within hours a new government is formed in Tunisia - one in which many of the same ministers, including Grira, maintained their positions. Ben Ali was never to return to his homeland, remaining in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, until his death in 2019. 
Defence Minister Ridha Grira and Army Chief Rachid Ammar declined to comment on the recordings when contacted by the BBC. Ben Ali's confidants, Kamel Eltaief and Tarak Ben Ammar, denied that the calls with them had taken place, with Ben Ammar adding that he had not attempted to reassure the president about his rule. 
The BBC has spent more than a year undertaking research into the authenticity of the recordings. They have been analysed by a number of leading audio-forensic experts in the UK and the US who looked for signs of tampering or editing, or 'deep fake' processing which artificially replicates voices. No suggestion of any kind of manipulation could be found. 
The BBC also sought to confirm the identity of those on the calls by playing the relevant extracts to individuals who know at least one of the speakers that appear to be heard. Those consulted included three of Ben Ali's top security officials, leaders of his political party, and even a voice-imitator of the president.  
All of those approached could identify the speakers and did not raise concerns about authenticity. Other evidence also corroborates the background of these calls, including previous statements by Minister of Defence Grira and Army Chief Ammar that they had spoken to the president while he was on the plane, with Ammar's recollection closely matching the content of his call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
The recordings suggest how an autocrat who oversaw a repressive and feared surveillance state for 23 years had been reduced to confusion and was at the mercy of his ministers' instructions in his final moments in power. In 2011, during his exile in Saudi Arabia, Ben Ali received a life sentence in absentia over the death of protesters during the revolution.

222;Downing Street apologises to Queen over lockdown parties;['2022-01-14T12:54:04.000Z'];['BBC News'];['coronavirus lockdown measures', 'boris johnson', 'queen elizabeth ii'];['street', 'downing', 'apologises', 'lockdown', 'prime', 'staff', 'image', 'told', 'johnson', 'attended', 'queen', 'parties', 'restrictions', 'party', 'work'];"
Downing Street has apologised to Buckingham Palace for two staff parties in No 10 the night before Prince Philip's funeral.
The gatherings, first reported by The Telegraph, took place on 16 April 2021 and went on until the early hours.
The PM's spokesman said it was ""deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning"".
Boris Johnson was not at either party - but he faces questions over alleged Covid rule-breaking at No 10.
The latest party revelations led to a backlash from opposition parties, who contrasted the behaviour of No 10 staff with pictures of the Queen sitting alone at the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral, due to Covid restrictions. 
The two staff get-togethers, on 16 April last year, took place at a time when Covid restrictions banned indoor socialising.
They have been added to the list of gatherings in government buildings being investigated by senior civil servant Sue Gray.
After the apology, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""This shows just how seriously Boris Johnson has degraded the office of prime minister.
""The Conservatives have let Britain down. An apology isn't the only thing the prime minister should be offering the palace today. 
""Boris Johnson should do the decent thing and resign.""
It is understood that the apology to the Palace was made by government officials. The PM's spokesman would not be drawn on whether Mr Johnson had also apologised personally to the monarch.
Earlier, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was ""very concerned"" about the latest revelations, and understood that ""people across the country are angry"".
She also urged people to wait for Ms Gray's inquiry, but added: ""we are very clear that there were real mistakes made"".
Five phrases attributed to famous figures, but did they even say them?!
50 years on, can the mystery be solved?

223;Downing Street parties: Will two Tory tribes go to war with the PM?;['2022-01-14T01:08:54.000Z'];['By Iain Watson'];['conservative party', 'boris johnson'];['street', 'downing', 'withdrawn', 'submitted', 'gone', 'estimate', 'taken', 'pinch', 'war', 'letters', 'salt', 'tribes', 'parties', 'number', 'tory'];"
Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has urged her colleagues to ""keep calm heads"" following the prime minister's admission he attended a drinks party in the Downing Street garden in May 2020.
She suggested some of the opposition to Boris Johnson was coming from his usual detractors.
But it is also the case that some of his previously vocal supporters - who admit they owed their election victory to Mr Johnson - are turning on him.
As one veteran of the May and Johnson premierships put it: ""Some of the 2019 intake are feeling trigger happy.""
This is, in part, driven by constituents who are making their views of so-called ""party-gate"" known in no uncertain terms.
One winner of a Red Wall seat told me: ""I have an inbox like many colleagues - yes, the usual lefty detractors, but there is a considerable amount of criticism from Conservative voters.
""There is a real problem.""
Another said that while it wasn't the worst ""influx"" of criticism they had experienced, the problem was growing, adding: ""People are concerned, people are worried.""
Their constituents' disgruntlement is feeding their own disillusion with their leadership.
As an MP who snatched their seat from Labour put it: ""Lots of my colleagues are at the end of their tether. 
""The polls are bad (one poll put Labour 10 points ahead this week) and are likely to get worse. This feels terminal.""
To trigger a leadership contest, 54 Conservative MPs would have to write to - or email - the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, Sir Graham Brady.
He is a paragon of discretion and never reveals how many of his colleagues have been sending anti-leadership missives until the requisite threshold has been reached.
So when people estimate the number of letters which have gone in (and letters can be withdrawn, as well as submitted) these should be taken, not with a pinch, but with a mine of salt.
Nonetheless, the talk at Westminster is that perhaps half a dozen letters or emails have been sent by 2019 MPs who would have been assumed to have been supportive.
And even if accurate, it is the tip of an iceberg of discontent and restlessness.
There are those who are critical privately but are keeping their powder dry until the senior civil servant Sue Gray delivers her report on the alleged parties and events during lockdown.
""I want to see the facts established,"" said one, while another added: ""This is not something to do lightly.""
So there is a moment of jeopardy for Boris Johnson.
A former government adviser characterised the situation like this: ""His biggest problem is the number of newly elected MPs he has got.
""There is a real divide between those elected in 2010 and 2015 and those from 2019 - those who have lived through the omnishambles Budget can see that this doesn't need to be terminal.""
That was when George Osborne's budget unravelled and Labour went ahead by around 10 points in the polls, but the Conservatives went on to win an overall majority in 2015.
He went on: ""The new intake, who should be ambitious to get on the ministerial ladder, aren't used to seeing polls tighten, so instead they are worried that they could lose their seats.""
But what of those sturdy veterans of the 2010 and the 2015 intake who have weathered previous political storms?
Well, the danger for the PM is that some of them are now openly breaking ranks too.
Caroline Nokes - a former minister elected in 2010 - said this week: ""He is damaging the entire Conservative brand for his unwillingness to accept the strictures that other people have lived by.""
William Wragg, a select committee chair who won his seat in 2015, told the BBC PM programme: ""A series of unforced errors are deeply damaging to the perception of the party. The prime minister's position is untenable.""
And off the record, some of the longer-standing MPs are privately critical.
""Anyone who has broken the rules must face the consequences,"" said one. 
Another told me that he believed Mr Johnson was impugning the reputation of his own MPs. 
But there is a disagreement over not just if to act, but when. 
Some MPs believe that any electoral consequences arising from the current turmoil need to be proven - and that would come after what are expected to be poor local election results in May.
But others are asking why good councillors should be potentially thrown to the wolves, and are more restless.
One longer standing MP has said that Chancellor Rishi Sunak ""shouldn't look too eager"" for the top job - it would be better to wait if a leadership challenge is to be successful.
Some of Mr Johnson's strongest critics in private insist that they are not part of any organised putsch or are in a rival camp - they are simply drawing their own conclusions from looking at their postbags.
One source insisted that Boris Johnson doesn't just have trouble with ""Red Wallers"" who worry that new voters might return to their old Labour roots, but ""those in Lib Dem-facing seats"" are worried too. 
And after the North Shropshire and Chesham and Amersham by-elections, that is perhaps understandable.
That said, a leadership challenge doesn't feel imminent.
It's possible the Sue Gray report may yet be more of a damp squib than the ammunition for a Conservative coup.
But several MPs I spoke to were fearful that hers would not be the last word on ""party-gate"", and that more damaging revelations may appear - either from Dominic Cummings or elsewhere if Mr Johnson stays in post.
A former government adviser who straddled the May/Johnson years put it like this: ""When something happens, it could happen quite quickly.
""Under Theresa May, there was a growing sense of inevitability - it feels a bit like that now.""
Five phrases attributed to famous figures, but did they even say them?!
50 years on, can the mystery be solved?

225;Jacob Rees-Mogg: Covid inquiry must look at whether rules were too tough;['2022-01-13T12:48:55.000Z'];['BBC News'];['coronavirus lockdown measures', 'jacob rees-mogg', 'boris johnson', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['jacob', 'look', 'goes', 'regulations', 'proportionate', 'tough', 'inquiry', 'added', 'consider', 'happened', 'hard', 'reesmogg', 'covid', 'rules'];"
Jacob Rees-Mogg has suggested lockdown rules may have been too tough at the time the May 2020 drinks party took place in Downing Street.
He told MPs a future inquiry about Covid should look at whether ""all those regulations were proportionate or whether it was too hard on people"".
At the time, lockdown guidance said gatherings must be limited to two people outside.
The PM admitted he attended the drinks but believed it was a ""work event"".
Mr Johnson told MPs he had joined colleagues for drinks for around 25 minutes, to ""thank groups of staff"" for their hard work during the pandemic and apologised for his handling of the event, saying he understood people's ""rage"".
He is facing calls to quit from some senior Tories, as well as opposition parties, after admitting attending the party.
Commons leader Mr Rees-Mogg said: ""I think everybody understands that people were obeying the rules and these rules were very hard for people to obey.""
He told MPs that he had been contacted by a friend who was unable to go to the funeral of his two-year old granddaughter during lockdown.
""We must consider as this goes to an inquiry and we look into what happened with Covid whether all those regulations were proportionate or whether it was too hard on people,"" he added.
The public inquiry into Covid is set to begin work this spring. Baroness Heather Hallett was announced as the inquiry chair in December.
The prime minister's official spokesman said the government had sought to strike the right balance when introducing regulations and guidance.
""Clearly this was a unique situation in which we were required to move at speed and oftentimes whilst the evidence base was continuing to grow.
""We've sought to learn lessons throughout as we developed guidance in response to the pandemic over this period. But we're confident we sought to strike the right balance throughout.""
He added: ""I think prime minister has absolutely acknowledged that these restrictions do not...there is no cost-free option, both in allowing the virus to continue unimpeded and indeed introducing restrictions on people's way of lives and their livelihood.""
The first coronavirus lockdown was introduced in England in late March and rules were slowly relaxed in May 2020, but it was not until 1 June that people were allowed to meet outside in groups of up to six people.
There were a number of legal restrictions in place in May 2020, including the law that people could not leave their homes - or be outside the place they live - without a reasonable excuse, which included work (where you couldn't work from home), exercise and getting things like food and medicine.
The gathering in Downing Street, described in the invitation as ""socially distanced"", was attended by around 30 people, who were invited to bring their own alcohol. 
Mr Rees-Mogg also continued his criticism of the Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, who has called for the prime minister's resignation.
Mr Rees-Mogg dubbed the MSP and MP a ""lightweight"" on Wednesday, and said: ""It seems to me that people who hold office ought to support the leader of the party, that is the honourable and proper thing to do.""

226;Space travel destroys red blood cells faster than on Earth;['2022-01-14T16:11:57.000Z'];['BBC News'];['the marrow study: keeping bones healthy in space'];['space', 'study', 'mean', 'earth', 'destroys', 'missions', 'travel', 'medicine', 'cells', 'need', 'blood', 'marrow', 'nature', 'published', 'faster', 'planets', 'red'];"
Scientists have discovered more about why space travel makes astronauts anaemic when they return to Earth.
Canadian researchers say 50% more red blood cells are destroyed in space and this continues for however long the mission lasts.
As a result, long voyages to the Moon, Mars and beyond may be a challenge, they say.
But their insights could benefit bedridden patients on Earth with the same condition.
""Space anaemia"" is something scientists have known about since the very first missions returned to Earth - but exactly why it happens has been a mystery.
Now a small University of Ottawa study of 14 astronauts - including Britain's Tim Peake - on six-month stays at the International Space Station, has found out more.
Using blood and breath samples taken during their missions, the researchers were able to measure red blood cell loss. These cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body - and are the key to life.
""Our study shows that upon arriving in space, more red blood cells are destroyed, and this continues for the entire duration of the astronaut's mission,"" said Dr Guy Trudel, lead researcher and hospital physician.
While in space, because of weightlessness, this isn't an issue - but back on Earth it means astronauts have reduced bone mass and muscle strength, and feel very tired.
Three million red blood cells are destroyed per second in space, compared to two million on terra firma. Fortunately, the body can compensate. If it didn't, astronauts would become very ill in space.
But the researchers are not sure how long the body can be in this constant state of repairing itself, especially if it's in space for a lengthy mission.
Even when astronauts in the study returned to living with gravity there was no quick fix, and a year later they were still found to be losing red blood cells at a higher rate.
Despite this, they were able to function normally. Male and female astronauts were equally affected.
""If we can find out exactly what's causing this anaemia, then there is a potential to treat it or prevent it, both for astronauts and for patients here on Earth,"" said Dr. Trudel.
He sees the anaemia caused by space travel as being ""similar"" to that experienced by patients who've spent months inactive in intensive care with illnesses like Covid.
Anaemia also prevents them exercising and recovering, and his team will research how this mechanism works in future studies.
The findings of the Marrow study, published in Nature Medicine, may mean people who take part in space missions to far-off planets would need to adapt their diets to make more iron, as well as eat more calories for energy.
Screening astronauts and space tourists for blood or health conditions affected by anaemia before spaceflight might also be necessary, the researchers say.

The prime minister is fighting to stay in No 10 - and the next few days could prove decisive.
MPs can't skulk, plotting, in Westminster's corridors at weekends. But for Boris Johnson, the time his colleagues spend back in their constituencies could prove even worse. 
One senior MP described how on Friday, during a standard school visit, he was asked by a group of nine-year-olds whether or not the prime minister was going to resign, and then was catcalled by teenage pupils about Boris Johnson's behaviour. 
As much as the prime minister's seemingly dwindling number of backers may wish this saga was merely a preoccupation of his many enemies or the press, the question of whether he stays or goes has become a national conversation. 
On Wednesday, presenters on cosy daytime TV sofas crossed live to the Commons for PMQs. Music radio presenters challenged each other to race to the Co-op on London's Strand to fill a carry-on case with a carry-out, after the latest claims about No 10 staff filling a suitcase with booze. 
One minister admits there is a ""lot of discontent"" among local party associations - which MPs will hear in person this weekend. And many report their email inboxes have been filling up with party members and constituents seething about what's been going on. 
The prime minister's future is now the subject of playground teasing. As the MP who had that awkward conversation with the nine-year-olds suggested, if many of his colleagues have similar experiences, ""Monday morning could be a very difficult moment"". 
Another senior MP, who has already been told by their local party chairman that the prime minister should quit, predicted that MPs will hear so much concern this weekend, ""it could all be over on Monday"". 
But hang on. There is nothing automatic about what happens next. 
The consensus among MPs right now seems to be at least to wait until the conclusions of Sue Gray's report are made public. 
One cabinet minister who says ""there is no getting away from the situation - it is very bad"", also cautions: ""It is very hard to get rid of a leader who doesn't want to go."" The minister says Johnson will ""want to go on and on and on"" - whatever the findings of the report. 
Another senior cabinet minister believes that while MPs are angry, ""they are not at the stage when they want to get rid of him"". Importantly, too, the cabinet itself does not seem to be taking a collective view about what to do. 
The mood among ministers is that the situation is pretty desperate. But they don't seem to be trying to take concerted action together, either, to find a way out. 
For one member of the cabinet, that's in contrast with memories they have of regular discussions about how to manage the political horror during the worst days of Theresa May's premiership. This may be in part down to the fact we are now in very different political times. 
There aren't bonds between groups at the most influential table in the land in the same way - no Brexiteer band determined to get their way whatever the cost, and no group like the one that was determined to protect Mrs May. 
There is, however, an acceptance that Boris Johnson faces a moment of real peril and has to change. One says: ""A lot of people say he has three months to significantly raise his game."" 
The question of whether the prime minister himself believes he has to change, or can, is an argument for another day. 
The precise wording of the Sue Gray report will be vital in all of this. Will she criticise the overall culture in No 10, or point to individuals or blame the prime minister himself? 
Remember, the report is official and Sue Gray's reputation is fearsome, but that's not the same as being an outsider. She is a senior government employee, not an independent arbiter. That's not to suggest that she will pull any punches, but it would be quite something if she were to suggest that Boris Johnson himself had directly broken the rules. 
Whatever the specifics of her conclusions, the position will still be difficult. And some of the rising generation of ministers not yet in cabinet may take a harsher view than those already at the top table. 
Sources suggest there are conversations taking place among the lower ranks, those who see themselves as the future of the party, about the possibility of taking action. The idea has been mooted that some of them may go to the prime minister once the report is out and say that either he goes, or they do instead. 
This doesn't seem to be a concrete plan, but an apparent lack of organisation in cabinet doesn't mean that there's no threat from others on the payroll. Johnson's ministers may not all be prepared to tolerate many more weeks like this. 
It's on the backbenches where MPs are far more open about the action they may take. One former minister, not a usual troublemaker, predicted confidently there will be enough letters calling for a vote of no confidence to bring about a contest next month. 
Another, who backed Boris Johnson originally, told me they will call for him to resign when the Gray report is published and expect enough others will agree to trigger a fight for him to stay in the job. 
But it is one thing threatening all of this privately right now. It's another to follow through. 
Another backbencher told me they were pleading with colleagues to remember the turmoil that changing a leader creates, saying: ""We might not be that far from an election - I just wish everyone would remember that."" 
Another told the BBC ""I can see no scenario where he's the PM going into the next election"" but ""it's not the right time"" to act. 
The pandemic is still with us. There is growing pressure on family finances. Yet the levels of frustration with No 10 are sky-high, in part because the fiasco is seen as being entirely self-inflicted. 
The behaviour itself, behind closed doors, is almost unbelievable to many. The handling of it a product of what's often seen as Johnson's credo - never apologise, never explain - which means rather than confronting the claims at the start and coming clean, allegations have been left to fester and grow, resulting yesterday in the most extraordinary apology, even, to the Queen. 
It's not at all clear how No 10 believes they can get through this crisis. 
Regular briefings to the press this week have been surreal and unproductive. I'm told the mood inside the building is terrible, one source telling me staff are unsure if colleagues are telling each other the truth. 
Some, it's said, are still holding on to the conviction that what happened can be explained away that the gatherings were ""events"" not parties, and that the technicalities of the rules may somehow see them through. 
The mood outside Downing Street is rather different, with disbelief that, as one cabinet minister suggested, ""Boris has persuaded himself he's the victim here"".  
There was ""consternation"" when the prime minister went to talk to MPs moments after his Commons apology and - as one of them described to me - told them ""he was bravely taking the blame for other people's mistakes"". 
The fate of Boris Johnson is certainly not yet sealed. The details of the Gray report matter. The bravado of MPs can melt away. The absence of an obvious, ready-to-go rival may protect him (although there are plenty who are lining up to have a go).
The prime minister may be able to rediscover what one of his colleagues describes as ""his magic"". It could prove in time that this was simply an appalling bout of the mid-term blues. And those who know well him think the chance of Boris Johnson concluding it's best to step away are extremely slim. 
But with each new day of allegations and embarrassment it's more likely that the decision could be taken out of his hands.

228;Endemic Covid: Is the pandemic entering its endgame?;['2022-01-15T01:47:56.000Z'];['James Gallagher'];['medical research', 'coronavirus lockdown measures', 'vaccination', 'james gallagher', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['world', 'pandemic', 'endgame', 'endemic', 'prof', 'vulnerable', 'virus', 'covid', 'uk', 'vaccines', 'die', 'entering'];"
Who hasn't let out an exasperated ""Is the pandemic finished yet?"" or a ""When can I just get on with my life?"" over the past two years? I know I have. 
The answer to those questions could be... very soon. 
There is growing confidence that Omicron could be hurtling the UK into the pandemic endgame. 
But what comes next? There will be no snap of the fingers to make the virus disappear. Instead, the new buzzword we'll have to get used to is ""endemic"" - which means that Covid is, without doubt, here to stay. 
So, is a new Covid-era truly imminent and what will that actually mean for our lives?
""We're almost there, it is now the beginning of the end, at least in the UK,"" Prof Julian Hiscox, chairman in infection and global health at the University of Liverpool, tells me. ""I think life in 2022 will be almost back to before the pandemic.""
What's changing is our immunity. The new coronavirus first emerged two years ago in Wuhan, China, and we were vulnerable. It was a completely new virus that our immune systems had not experienced before and we had no drugs or vaccines to help. 
The result was like taking a flamethrower into a fireworks factory. Covid spread explosively around the world - but that fire cannot burn at such high intensity forever.  
There were two options - either we would extinguish Covid, as we did with Ebola in West Africa, or it would die down but be with us for the long term. It would join the swarm of endemic diseases - such as common colds, HIV, measles, malaria and tuberculosis - that are always there. 
For many, this was the inevitable fate of a virus that spreads through the air before you even know you're sick. ""Endemicity was written into this virus,"" says Dr Elisabetta Groppelli, a virologist at St George's, University of London. 
""I am very optimistic,"" she says. ""We'll soon be in a situation where the virus is circulating, we will take care of people at risk, but for anybody else we accept they will catch it - and your average person will be fine.""
Epidemiologists, who study the spread of diseases, would consider a disease endemic when levels are consistent and predictable - unlike the ""boom and bust"" waves so far in the pandemic. 
But Prof Azra Ghani, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, says other people are using it to mean Covid is still around, but that we no longer need to restrict our lives. 
She thinks we'll get there ""rapidly"", adding: ""It seems like it's taken a long time, but only a year ago we started vaccinating and we're already an awful lot freer because of that.""
The only major curve ball would be a new variant that can outcompete Omicron and cause significantly more severe disease.
It is important to remember that endemic does not automatically mean mild. ""We have some huge killer diseases that we consider endemic,"" says Prof Ghani. Smallpox was endemic for thousands of years and killed a third of people who were infected. Malaria is endemic and causes around 600,000 deaths a year.
But we are already seeing the signs that Covid is becoming less deadly as our bodies become more familiar with fighting it. 
In the UK there has been a vaccination campaign, a booster campaign and waves of Covid involving four different variants of the virus.
""When Omicron has finished and moved through, immunity in the UK will be high, at least for a while,"" says Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh.
The high level of infections has come at a price, with more than 150,000 deaths in the UK. But it has left a protective legacy in our immune systems. That immunity will wane so we should expect to catch Covid in the future, but it should still reduce the chances of becoming seriously ill. 
Prof Hiscox - who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group - says that means most people won't be badly affected.
""Should a new variant or old variant come along, for most of us, like any other common cold coronavirus, we'll get the sniffles and a bit of a headache and then we're OK.""
There will be people - mostly the old and vulnerable - who will die from endemic Covid. So there is still a decision to be made about how we live alongside it.
""If you're willing to tolerate zero deaths from Covid, then we're facing a whole raft of restrictions and it's not game over,"" Prof Hiscox explains.
But, he says, ""In a bad flu season, 200-300 die a day over winter and nobody wears a mask or socially distances, that's perhaps a right line to draw in the sand.""
Lockdowns and restrictions on mass gatherings will not come back and mass testing for Covid will end this year, he expects. 
The near certainty is there will be booster vaccines for the vulnerable come the autumn in order to top up their protection through winter. 
""We need to accept the fact that our flu season is also going to be a coronavirus season, and that is going to be a challenge for us,"" says Dr Groppelli. 
However, it is still uncertain how bad winters will be as the people who die from flu and Covid tend to be the same. As one scientist put it, ""You can't die twice.""
Prof Riley thinks we won't be compelled to wear face masks after Omicron, but they will become ""a much more common sight"" as they are in parts of Asia as people choose to wear them in crowded places. 
She adds: ""The likely scenario is life won't look much different to the autumn of 2019, when we all turned up for our flu vaccines.""
While the UK is ahead of most of the world due to a combination of vaccines and a large number of infections, the planet is not remotely close to seeing the end of the pandemic. 
Poorer countries are still waiting for vaccines to give to their most vulnerable people. Meanwhile countries that kept Covid at arms' length have had very few deaths, but also have less immunity in their populations. 
The World Health Organization has been clear the world is a long way off describing Covid as endemic. 
""For the world it is still a pandemic and an acute emergency,"" Dr Groppelli concludes.

229;How a colossal block of ice became an obsession;['2022-01-15T02:03:48.000Z'];['By Jonathan Amos'];['earth science', 'antarctic', 'icebergs', 'climate change'];['obsession', 'way', 'taking', 'kevin', 'slow', 'ice', 'colossal', 'things', 'produce', 'sort', 'block', 'little', 'work', 'thats'];"
Did you develop an obsession during lockdown? Did those long weeks and months take you down surprising avenues? Where did your mind wander? 
The Swiss-based British artist Kevin Eason found himself thinking about Antarctica and one particularly large chunk of ice. He'd read an article, by me as it happens, about a 300-billion-tonne iceberg that had recently calved from the east of the continent. D28, it's called; although that's not its only name as I'll explain. 
Kevin's interest was piqued by the satellite images that scientists began publishing of this berg, along with the sometimes surprising colours they would choose to render scenes and emphasise contrast. 
""It started out quite small. Just little studies,"" the artist recalls. 
""I found myself taking images that I'd see of D28, dropping them into Photoshop, and making colour samples. I was basically making pantones from Antarctica based on images that were being circulated around the internet.
""I spent weeks mixing the paint to match these colours. I guess it was a form of meditation. And then I was bound to the studio, and so it just started developing into something.""
That something is a series of four oil paintings depicting the life of D28. The first picture captures the definitive and distinctive outline of the berg in the days immediately after it broke from the edge of Antarctica's Amery Ice Shelf. The ones that follow are from Kevin's imagination. 
The series marks the years 2019, 2021, 2023, and 2025. We don't know when that final, speculative view will occur, but it will happen eventually. Icebergs are born to wither and melt away.
Those people who've seen the series have had various reactions, but some of the themes are common. You won't be surprised to learn that when asked to describe an emotion or feeling, the words that viewers used included ""transformation"", ""scale"", ""time"", ""isolation"", ""drifting"", ""silence"", ""change"",  ""awareness"", and ""loss"".
And, quite naturally, Kevin's D28 journey has brought environmental issues - and the loss of ice - to the forefront of his mind. Being in Switzerland, this is a very topical concern. Alpine glaciers are retreating rapidly in our warming climate, prompting local people to blanket the ice streams in Summer to try to protect them. 
""If I can produce a work of art that might have some sort of impact, or assist in some way; that might help slow down consumption or make people consider things a little bit more by taking fewer flights, or driving their cars less - that's got to be a good way to go,"" says Kevin.
My own interest in D28 goes back to the mid-2000s, long before it calved. At that time I was reporting research on the Amery Ice Shelf that sought to predict which part of this vast, floating wedge of ice might break first, and when. 
Attention had focused on an area that became nicknamed ""Loose Tooth"" because it looked in satellite images like a child's wobbly front tooth. 
The team studying the cracks developing in the ice shelf thought a calving might be imminent. It wasn't. Loose Tooth is still there, still wobbling, still hanging on to the Amery. It was the adjacent, 1,636-sq-km section that came away - the big berg now formally designated D28 (the largest Antarctic bergs are given an official listing by the US National Ice Center).
I joked with the Amery research team, led by Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, that perhaps another dental analogy was needed. ""It is the molar compared to a baby tooth,"" Helen laughed. And the nickname stuck.
People regularly now post satellite pictures of ""Molar Berg"", aka D28, as it bumps and grinds its way around the Antarctic coast. Even astronauts on the space station can see it, albeit from an oblique angle.
A keen observer is Dr Catherine Walker from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. As a graduate student in the 2000s, she was tasked with studying those cracks in the Amery Ice Shelf.
""It was actually sort of sad to see it go, because it was something that I'd had all this time, and then it was gone,"" Catherine tells me.
""I really appreciate Kevin's paintings. I feel like that's my entire career right there.""
There's a growing appreciation of these city-sized bergs (Molar Berg was bigger than Greater London when it broke away). 
They dump huge quantities of fresh water into the wider ocean, along with iron and other minerals scraped off the Antarctic landmass. This influences the behaviour of local currents and food webs. 
D28/Molar Berg's travels have taken it a full quarter turn around the White Continent. It's now entered the Weddell Sea which is directly south of the Atlantic Ocean.
And it just so happens that it's moving in the direction of what is currently the world's biggest iceberg - a near-4,000-sq-km monster known as A23, which has been pinned fast to the Weddell seafloor for three decades. 
""Yep, that's one of mine, too,"" says Catherine. ""I always watch A23 because we're the same age. It calved in 1986 and it's started to wiggle recently.
""What's the fascination with these giant icebergs? I guess it has something to do with their size; they're so much bigger than you can imagine - like Everest or K2. You look at them and wonder: how do they hold themselves together.""
I think that's right. Their great scale is truly awesome. But for me it's also the way such imposing objects, built from snows that originally fell on Antarctica thousands of years ago, and which seem as though they ought to be so permanent, can suddenly disintegrate and fade away in a very short time.

Police in the US state of Texas are negotiating with a man who appears to have taken at least four hostages at a synagogue in the town of Colleyville. 
It is not known if he is armed or if anyone has been hurt. 
The service was being streamed live when the incident started. The feed has since been taken down, but not before an angry man could be heard saying he did not want anyone to be hurt. 
Police deployed special weapons teams and local people were evacuated.
At least four hostages - including the rabbi - are believed to be inside the synagogue, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
President Joe Biden ""has been briefed about the developing hostage situation in the Dallas area"", White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter.
The police department in Colleyville said in a tweet at 11:30 (16:30 GMT) that it was ""conducting SWAT operations"" at the address of the Congregation Beth Israel.
Two hours later the department said the situation remained ""ongoing"".
""We ask that you continue to avoid the area. We will continue to provide updates via social media,"" it said.
A live stream of the Shabbat morning service on Facebook captured audio of a man talking loudly.
He could be heard saying, ""You get my sister on the phone"" and ""I am gonna die"".
He was also heard saying: ""There's something wrong with America.""
Barry Klompus, a member of the congregation since it opened in 1999, said he had been told about the incident by another member and had quickly turned to the live feed until it was pulled.
""It was horrible listening and watching, and it's that much more horrible not knowing,"" Mr Klompus told Reuters news agency.

Nino Cerruti - one of the great Italian designers and fashion entrepreneurs - has died aged 91. 
Reports say he passed away in hospital in Piedmont where he had checked in for a hip operation. 
He always insisted on trying on his own creations first. Many of them were kept at the textile factory his grandfather founded in the town of Biella in 1881.
""I have always dressed the same person, myself,"" he once said, according to AFP news agency.
With his experience in producing excellent fabrics at his family's textile mill, Cerruti went into the clothing business in the late 1950s. 
He opened his first boutique in Paris in 1967. 
When he asked male and female models to walk down the catwalk in the same clothes, he revolutionised fashion, AFP notes.
In the '80s, he branched out into Hollywood, designing clothes for stars including Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas, Sharon Stone, Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks.

234;Kenyan vigilantes taking on avocado gangs;['2022-01-16T00:38:30.000Z'];['By Emmanuel Igunza'];['africa today podcasts'];['pitch', 'avocado', 'taking', 'gangs', 'size', 'football', 'fallen', 'action', 'kenyan', 'owner', 'victim', 'vigilantes', 'thieves', 'half', 'farm'];"
Kenya's avocado sector has become so lucrative that organised criminal gangs have begun to target growers.
This is because the fruit from just one tree can pay for the private education of a secondary school student for a whole year - up to $600 (£450).
With the demand for the fruit growing in the US and Europe, Kenya overtook South Africa last year to become the continent's top avocado exporter.
Vigilante groups are now being formed to protect the crop, known as ""green gold"".
As night falls on a fairly large farm in the central county of Murang'a, six young men dressed in thick raincoats and armed with torches, machetes and clubs start their shift. 
They have been hired to guard the farm and its precious avocados.
It is dangerous work - and people can get hurt and even killed.
""It was either us or them unfortunately and we had to protect ourselves,"" one of them tells me, referring to a recent incident in which a suspected avocado thief was killed.
The owner of the farm, which is about half an acre - or half the size of a football pitch, says he has had to take action as he has fallen victim to the thieves. 
""You can fence the entire farm but that won't stop them,"" he says, showing me where his barbed wire fence has been cut.
""You spend an entire season taking care of your crops, then in a single night all your fruits are stolen in a matter of hours.""
Another of the vigilantes who is mending the fence agrees: ""They'll still cut it and steal what they want.""
He worries how the community will suffer as most people survive on the trade - many work for those with bigger farms, while most families also have a couple of trees themselves.
""If we sleep, our fathers and mothers won't have a cent,"" he says.
Their watch will end at daybreak. 
Avocados tend to be harvested in Kenya between February and October - but the thieves have been targeting the immature fruit.
In an effort to clamp down on the black market, the authorities have imposed a ban on exporting avocados from November until the end of January.
But it is having little effect on the ground - in fact farmers like those in Murang'a county are having to harvest early in order to save their crop from the avocado cartels.
Leaving them on the trees is simply an invitation to the thieves.
In Meru county - about 100km (60 miles) further north - the situation is much worse. We arrive as European buyers are in the area.
This means some avocado farmers there, like Kinyua Mburugu, are allowed to harvest early. 
So in a single day, thousands of hectares of Hass avocados are picked, selling for up to 19 Kenyan shillings ($0.17, £0.12) each.
The avocados are assessed to ensure quality at the local distribution centre - because if picked too early the fruit will not ripen at all.
For Mr Mburugu, the decision to pick early was taken to keep the thieves at bay.
But in the future he intends to take on the gangs by using a computer purchased through his local avocado co-operative society.
He will connect it to CCTV cameras that he is putting up around his 10-acre (4.04-hectare) farm.
From the comfort of his living room, he intends to keep on eye on his more than 200 mature trees, helped by his tech-savvy son, a film studies graduate. 
""My son is thinking of flying drones around so we can have 24/7 surveillance of our farm,"" Mr Mburugu says.
""Isn't that expensive?"" I ask.
""No, no… the savings will justify everything."" 
As we speak, he receives a phone call. The vigilantes have caught several men who rented a house in the centre of Meru town, part of the cartel stealing fruit. 
Later, Julius Kinoti, who heads the neighbourhood watch security team, says they found that the house was full of sacks of stolen avocados.
They alert the police but he warns the authorities need to do more about the problem as people could take matters into their own hands.
""That night we caught those thieves, if I had blown the whistle to alert people, villagers would have come and would have killed them - mob justice - because people are angry.""
Kenya's avocado trade is still in its infancy, but more and more farmers are deciding to invest in avocados.
Last year, the fruit earned Kenyans farmers $132m (£100m) from exporting about 10% of the harvested crop, according to the trade ministry.
""If we ensure quality control, we will definitely reach the heights of the big producers like Peru and Brazil,"" says Mr Mburugu.
""In the next five years, I don't think many people here will have tea farms. Avocados are the way to go."" 
He uprooted his fields of tea a few years ago - it is not a move he regrets, he just hopes he can keep the avocado cartels at bay.

A hostage-taker who detained four people at a synagogue in a suburb of Dallas, Texas, was a British citizen, reports say. 
The man interrupted a morning service in Colleyville on Saturday and has since died. 
Police deployed special weapons teams, while FBI negotiators spent hours talking to the assailant.
Explosions and gunfire could be heard before the 10-hour stand-off ended. The hostages have been freed unharmed.  
In a statement, the UK Foreign Office said it was aware of the death of a British man in Texas and was in contact with the local authorities. It is not yet clear how the hostage-taker died or who he was.
The four people taken hostage included the synagogue's rabbi, according to US media reports.
The service was being streamed online when the incident began. One of the hostages was released unharmed six hours later, with the other three being led to safety by police several hours after that.
President Joe Biden was briefed about the developing situation.
The incident began at around 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) when police were called to the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue. People were evacuated from the area shortly after.
A live stream of the Shabbat morning service on Facebook captured audio of a man talking loudly. He could be heard saying: ""You get my sister on the phone"" and ""I am gonna die.""
He was also heard saying: ""There's something wrong with America."" The feed has since been taken down.
The hostage-taker was heard demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist who is currently serving an 86-year prison term in the US, law enforcement officials told local media. 
Siddiqui was convicted of trying to kill US military officers while in custody in Afghanistan. Thousands took to the streets in Pakistan to protest against her conviction in 2010.
After the Islamic State (IS) group kidnapped American journalist James Foley in Syria in 2012, they emailed his family demanding the release of Siddiqui. 
A lawyer representing Siddiqui told CNN in a statement that the hostage-taker was not her brother, saying Siddiqui's family condemned his ""heinous"" actions.
Texas resident Victoria Francis, who was watching the live stream before it cut out, told the Associated Press that she heard the man rant against America and claim he had a bomb.
 ""He was pretty irritated and the more irritated he got, he'd make more threats,"" she said.

236;SLS: Nasa fixes glitchy megarocket equipment ahead of key test;['2022-01-17T09:33:49.000Z'];['By Paul Rincon'];['orion', 'artemis', 'nasa', 'florida', 'human spaceflight', 'astronauts', 'exploration of the moon', 'the moon', 'engineering', 'space exploration', 'space launch system (sls)'];['glitchy', 'precision', 'megarocket', 'powerful', 'test', 'rs25', 'fixes', 'equipment', 'orbit', 'ahead', 'propel', 'help', 'sls', 'key', 'rocket', 'nasa', 'problems', 'provide'];"
Nasa has fixed a problem with malfunctioning equipment on a new rocket designed to take astronauts to the Moon.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been preparing the giant Space Launch System (SLS) for its maiden flight, set for March.
Last month, it identified a glitch with an onboard engine controller.
But the component has now been replaced and all four engine controllers performed well in tests last week.
They act as the ""brains"" for each of the powerful RS-25 engines, which help propel the SLS into orbit, communicating with the rocket to provide precision control of the engine and diagnose any problems.
At the end of last year, some electronics on the controller for engine four failed to power up consistently during a test.
But last week, all the controllers were powered up and performed as expected while engineers put them through their paces in further testing.
The SLS is housed in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center, in Florida.
When the Orion spacecraft is stacked on top, the full system stands 98m (322ft) high - taller than the Statue of Liberty. 
This version of the SLS will generate a whopping 8,800,000lb (39.1meganewtons) of thrust.
This is 15% more than the powerful Saturn V launcher that lofted people to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s.
This SLS is being prepared for a mission called Artemis-1, which will see the rocket launch Nasa's Orion spacecraft towards the Moon.
The mission is intended to test SLS and Orion systems ahead of the first crewed launch, in 2024.
The culmination of testing for the Artemis-1 hardware is the wet dress rehearsal, where the SLS is rolled out to the launch pad at Kennedy and loaded with its cryogenic (cold) liquid propellants.
The mission known as Artemis-3 will see the first people land on the lunar surface since the Apollo 17 mission, in 1972. 
It could launch in 2025, if all goes well.
The crew members who will touch down on the Moon as part of this mission have yet to be announced but Nasa is training a select pool of astronauts to fly the Orion spacecraft.

237;How delivery apps created 'the Netflix of food ordering';['2022-01-17T00:06:23.000Z'];['By Stav Dimitropoulos and Will Smale'];['female entrepreneurs', 'takeaway food', 'entrepreneurship', 'food', 'delivery services'];['netflix', 'recipes', 'yonca', 'apps', 'fourth', 'days', 'delivery', 'week', 'ordering', 'wedding', 'recently', 'uzundag', 'created', 'food', 'work', 'ms'];"
Husband and wife, Emre Uzundag and Yonca Cubuk, say they are now ""living their small dream"", all thanks to a food delivery app.
The Turkish couple moved to New York in 2020, and due to coronavirus they found themselves stuck in their small apartment in Brooklyn.
Homesick, they started to cook more and more Turkish food, to help them cope with the stresses of lockdown. ""Which was a mental necessity during the pandemic,"" says Ms Cubuk.
They then moved on to cooking meals for friends around the city, and Ms Cubuk says the feedback was incredibly positive. 
""They started to tell us that we should turn it into a career.""
Despite neither of the pair having worked as a professional chef before, last year they decided to take the plunge, and signed their business up to a new food delivery app called Woodspoon.
While the huge market-leading delivery apps, such as Just Eat, Deliveroo, Uber Eats and DoorDash (the biggest in the US) now list many large restaurant chains, Woodspoon's business model is entirely different.
It was launched at the start of 2020 to link home cooks - people literally cooking from the kitchen in their house or apartment - to customers who want a fresh, homemade takeaway, rather than something from a chain restaurant.
You order via the Woodspoon app, which sends the details to the relevant home chef. Then, when the food has been cooked, it is picked up and delivered by a Woodspoon driver.
Although still only available in the Brooklyn borough of New York, with more than 120 cooks currently on its books, the plan is to expand. 
Emre Uzundag and Yonca Cubuk's BanBan Anatolian Home Cooking is now available via the app four days a week, while on the other three days they work on new recipes. Ms Cubik says that they are so busy that they recently had to work on their fourth wedding anniversary.
Yet, thanks to Woodspoon, they don't have to go to the expense of renting a commercial premise.
""Woodspoon gives us a platform and a voice to tell our story,"" she adds. ""And we are more than just kebabs and pilaf [a rice dish]... our best-selling dishes are the lentil soup and the orange spinach stew, both are vegetarian, the latter one is vegan.""
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Woodspoon's co-founder, Lee Reschef, says that launching at the same time as the start of the pandemic actually proved to be helpful. ""We were fortunate enough to help a lot of restaurant workers that needed to find a new line of income,"" she says.
Before home chefs are accepted by Woodspoon they have to show proof of food safety training, and the company sends someone out to carry out an inspection of their kitchen.
The chefs also have to register their business with the relevant local authority, and be subjected to official food hygiene tests.
While Woodspoon is currently focused on US expansion the concept could also work in the UK, where it is also legal to run a food business from a residential property.
With the pandemic closing restaurants for long periods of time, the past two years has been boom time for takeaway delivery apps. The UK's largest, Just Eat, saw its revenues hit £725m in 2020, up 42% from 2019, while those at DoorDash jumped more than threefold to $2.9bn (£2.1bn).
Yet, while many of us are increasingly using these types of apps, people often cite one frustration - that you cannot order from multiple restaurants at the same time, and get all the different dishes delivered together.
That is, however, now changing, with a small but growing number of apps starting to offer that service.
One of those at the forefront is US app, Go By Citizens, which is run by restaurant and takeaway group C3. It allows its customers to order from a number of its brands at the same time, such as Umami Burger, Krispy Rice, Cicci di Carne, and Sam's Crispy Chicken.
To ensure that the food is all cooked and ready for delivery at the same time, C3 says it operates 800 so-called ""dark"" or ""ghost"" kitchens across the US - warehouse cooking facilities that house a number of kitchens under the same roof, all making delivery-only meals.
""Our app allows consumers to pick, choose and group their favourite menu items [together] from an array of C3 brands in a single order,"" says C3 chief executive Sam Nazarian. He describes it as ""the Netflix of food ordering"".
In addition to C3 brands, the company is inviting other people's restaurants and food businesses into its ghost kitchens and tech platform, including California's Soom Soom Fresh Mediterranean and Florida's Cindy Lou's Cookies.
Meanwhile, US ghost kitchen business, Kitchen United, also now lets its customers order from a number of different restaurant brands at the same time, via its app Kitchen United Max.
""Everything is delivered, or available for pick-up, at the same time and on the same bill,"" says Kitchen United, chief executive, Michael Montagano. ""So, if someone in the household wants sushi, but another wants pizza, that's entirely doable.""
Kitchen United Max is available in 10 US locations, with another eight currently in development.
In the UK, Deliveroo also runs a number of dark kitchens, called Deliveroo Editions - where takeaway businesses are invited to set up shop rent free. However, a Deliveroo spokeswoman confirmed that, currently, the food from each offering still has to be ordered separately via its app.
Whether it's a focus on home cooks, or allowing customers to order from more than one restaurant at once, does the continuing growth of delivery apps put more pressure on physical restaurants and takeaways already struggling to stay afloat?
UK food and restaurant critic, Andy Hayler, says he thinks some people might find it off-putting that an app allows you to order food from two or more restaurants at once.
""If I saw a menu offering two to three different things, this would suggest to me this is just some generic catering company, which is banging out industrial foods,"" he says.
Mr Hayler adds that certain foods, such as curry are well suited for delivery. While others, such as French and Japanese cuisine, struggle in takeaway form because the dishes are supposed to be well presented on a restaurant plate, and not bashed about in transit in a plastic container.
""Half of the experience [of French and Japanese restaurants] is looking at the food there,"" he says.

239;Tonga eruption: How its impact spread so widely and violently;['2022-01-17T16:52:05.000Z'];['By The Visual Journalism Team  '];['volcanoes', 'tsunamis', 'tonga', 'pacific ocean'];['spread', 'water', 'surface', 'pushing', 'wave', 'tsunami', 'floor', 'pressure', 'ocean', 'tonga', 'experts', 'say', 'impact', 'widely', 'eruption', 'violently'];"
A massive volcanic eruption in Tonga, on Saturday, triggered a tsunami that spread across the Pacific in a matter of hours.
Waves hit Australia, New Zealand and Japan as well as the west coasts of North and South America.
An atmospheric shockwave was detected around the world and a huge ash cloud has covered Pacific islands for hundreds of miles.
Here's what we know about how and why it spread so widely and violently.
Tonga is made up of about 170 islands, many uninhabited, about 2,000 miles (3,300km) east of Australia.
The volcano, Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai, sits 40 miles north of the capital. 
On Saturday, the centre of the volcano sank, disappearing under the sea.  
About two hours later, it erupted, with devastating force. 
When the eruption had ended, almost all of the volcano and the land around it had disappeared.
The eruption set off a massive atmospheric shockwave travelling at about 300m (1,000ft) per second. 
Pressure changes were detected on the other side of the world, in Europe, 15 hours later.
The explosion was heard across the Pacific, from Fiji to Alaska.
Waves from the tsunami spread rapidly across the Pacific.
They took less than five hours to reach New Zealand, about 10 to reach Alaska.
Experts say the tsunami may have been caused by the collapse of debris on the ocean floor and boosted by the pressure wave pushing down on the surface of the water.
The waves continued through Sunday and were still being recorded in Australia on Monday.
Tsunami waves can be much more destructive than normal waves, even when they are not particularly high.
A normal wave might take 15 seconds to wash up the shore and flow back out.
Some of the tsunami waves in Australia were under 1m but lasted almost 30 minutes. 
They kept moving onshore for 15 minutes and took about 15 minutes to move back out. 
The exact reasons why this eruption was so violent are still being assessed by experts.
Some believe the speed with which the molten magma was blasted out of the volcano may have  played a big part.
When magma filled with volcanic gas is forced through sea water at high speed, there is no time for a layer of steam to cool it.
And this ""fuel-coolant interaction"" causes a massive chemical explosion, researchers say.
Deeper water could have suppressed this - but the volcano's surface was just 150-200m under the sea.
Communications with Tonga have been largely destroyed, making it difficult to assess the scale of the destruction. 
Internet and telephone communications are extremely limited and outlying coastal areas remain cut off.
The Red Cross said even satellite phones, used by many aid agencies, had poor service because of the ash cloud. 
The organisation estimates up to 80,000 people may have been affected by the tsunami.
The dust from the volcano could contaminate water supplies, with locals advised to drink bottled water and wear masks.
The government of New Zealand, which has been helping assess the destruction, says the western coast of Tongatapu, Tonga's main island, has seen ""significant damage"".

240;Pacific volcano: Science will explain event's ferocity;['2022-01-17T16:08:21.000Z'];['Jonathan Amos'];['earth science', 'volcanoes', 'tsunamis', 'geology', 'tonga'];['science', 'volcano', 'pacific', 'tappin', 'know', 'millimetres', 'ferocity', 'right', 'tsunami', 'krakatau', 'ocean', 'prof', 'events', 'land', 'survey', 'explain'];"
The explosive eruption of Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai sent a shockwave around the world.
The event literally touched every corner of the globe as a pressure wave spread out in all directions to complete a full circumnavigation.
Scientists, of course, are now asking themselves why the eruption was so powerful. They also want to understand how the tsunami was created.
The answers to both these questions feed into future hazard preparedness, although to be honest, right now, these finer details are much less important than the immediate needs of nearby islanders.
Their lives have been up-ended by catastrophic flooding and ash fall-out.
Nonetheless, scientific insights will emerge; they're already being assembled.
The name Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai (HT-HH) refers to the two island structures that stood about 100m above the Pacific Ocean surface, roughly 65km north of Tonga's capital, Nuku'alofa.
What wasn't apparent to the casual observer was the hidden edifice below-water - a volcanic mountain rising some 1,800m above the seafloor.
The HT-HH islands represented just the upper-most part of the rim of a caldera - the opening to the volcano - that was 6km across. It was in this submerged caldera that gas-rich magma came into contact with cold seawater to devastating effect.
For Prof Shane Cronin, from the University of Auckland, who's made a detailed study of this volcano, the water depth was critical.
""The caldera summit is about 150-200m below sea-level. That's just about the right depth for there to be quite strong, explosive interactions between the magma and the seawater,"" he told BBC News.
""Once you get much, much deeper, then what tends to happen is there's too much seawater, and it suppresses that explosive activity.""
Prof Cronin said a big event had been due. The last major eruption was in the year AD 1100, and prior to that there was a major episode 1,800 years ago. On that basis the repeat cycle was roughly 900 years. That's now.
The tsunami that followed could have been created in several ways. In the near-field, where waves over one metre high were recorded at the Nuku'alofa tide gauge, some component would have resulted from rock and ash initially thrown high into the sky then descending back down into the ocean to displace its waters.
What scientists can't rule out at this stage is whether the extreme energy in the event didn't also cause some kind of submarine flank failure on the volcano. Something similar occurred at Anak Krakatau in Indonesia in 2018, although that involved a large amount of material above water then becoming submerged.
""This is a possibility, for sure,"" commented Dr Vicki Ferrini from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. 
""In data we collected in 2016, you could see a lot of big solidified chunks that looked like they had slid down the side of the volcano in the past. So, with an explosion of this size, you certainly wouldn't be surprised if further large sections of consolidated material had moved.
""The good thing is we have the baseline data to make a comparison when we go back in, but only when it's safe.""
For far-field effects, there is a lot of discussion around whether that shockwave could have contributed to the run-ups recorded in New Zealand, Australia, and at beaches and inlets along both North and South America and in Japan.
The idea is that the sudden change in air pressure punches down on the surface of the ocean.
""This can change the elevation in the ocean by millimetres to centimetres, and when this gets closer to land, if the conditions are right, it can generate tsunami. We know this happened for example in the great eruption of Krakatau in 1883,"" said Prof Dave Tappin from the British Geological Survey.
""We're working on it right now. Fortunately, over the past 20 years, we've developed the mathematics to numerically model these events to better understand them.""
What was so remarkable about that pressure wave is just how far it travelled.
The impact on the atmosphere from the explosive eruption was obvious in the earliest satellite imagery as an expanding ring of disturbance moving out in all directions.
Meteorologists, both professional and amateur, immediately recognised that they might be able to detect the signal even on the other side of the world.
In the UK - which is about as far away as you can get from Tonga - the barometers wiggled at the expected moment.
""These things travel at the speed of sound, so on Saturday night quite a lot of people lined up expecting something. And that's what happened - a slight increase in pressure (about 1.5 millibars) followed by a decrease lasting about half an hour,"" explained Prof Giles Harrison from the University of Reading.
""The distance from Tonga to the UK is about 16,500km, and with an interval of about 14 hours - that gives you the sort of speed you would expect, at roughly 300m per second.""
The Reading barometer had recorded a total three pulses by 7am UK time on Monday.
Again, Prof Harrison said there were parallels with the 1883 Krakatoa event. Victorian meteorologists reported similar signals.
In the coming weeks and months, as activity subsides at Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai, researchers will be able to get in close to examine the remnants of the two islands. Most of their above-water bulk has gone, not unsurprisingly given the ferocity of the blast.
But the bigger concern is getting assistance to the affected islands in the Tongan archipelago. Satellite imagery returned in just the past day reveals considerable damage.
""And there are longer-term problems that come from all that ash. It's going to impact on agriculture and water quality,"" said Prof Tappin.

The remains of a four-year-old Belgian boy who disappeared last week have been found in the Netherlands, Dutch police have announced. 
Dean Verberckmoes was reported missing by his family after his babysitter failed to drop him off at his grandparents' house. 
On Monday police discovered his body on an artificial island in Holland's Zeeland province.
Dutch police announced they had detained a 34-year-old Belgian man.
Police said the man, who they have not formally identified, was arrested in the Dutch town of Meerkerk, around 120 kilometres (60 miles) northeast of where the boy's body was found. 
Dutch media reported that Dean Verberckmoes had been staying with family friends before he was reported missing. 
Police said the suspect and the boy were last seen on Wednesday in the Belgian city of Sint Niklaas, near Antwerp. 
Officials in the Netherlands launched a mammoth search operation after receiving information that Verberckmoes could be in the country. 
Following the man's arrest, police issued an ""amber alert"" - a notice sent out in child abduction cases - with a description of the child and a photograph.  
Verberckmoes' body was discovered on Neeltje Jans, an artificial island in Zeeland province, soon after.
A police statement issued on Monday night said a police helicopter took part in the search, and investigators found a ""possible crime scene"". Around 22:00 local time (21:00 GMT) officers found ""the lifeless body of a child"", the statement said. 
In a short message posted to Twitter, police confirmed that the remains were those of the missing toddler and thanked those involved in the search, as well as sending their ""condolences"" to the family.

242;Plastic crisis needs binding treaty, report says;['2022-01-18T00:42:29.000Z'];['By Roger Harrabin'];['plastic', 'plastic pollution'];['resolution', 'production', 'treaty', 'question', 'plastics', 'report', 'waste', 'right', 'plastic', 'weak', 'needs', 'crisis', 'remediation', 'binding', 'pollution'];"
Pollution from plastics is a global emergency in need of a robust UN treaty, according to a report.
The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) says there's a cascade of evidence of harm from plastics.
It argues that the plastic pollution threat is almost equivalent to climate change.
The air we breathe now contains plastic micro particles, there’s plastic in Arctic snow, plastic in soils and plastic in our food.
It's reported, for instance, that about 20 elephants in Thailand have died after eating plastic waste from a rubbish dump.
The authors urge nations to agree a UN treaty with binding targets for reducing both plastic production and waste.
""There is a deadly ticking clock counting swiftly down,"" said the EIA’s Tom Gammage. 
""If this tidal wave of pollution continues unchecked, the anticipated plastics in the seas by 2040 could exceed the collective weight of all fish in the ocean.""
The United Nations has identified three existential environmental threats - climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution - and concluded that they must be addressed together.
Multilateral agreements on biodiversity loss and climate have existed for nearly 30 years (although they have failed to halt CO2 emissions or protect the natural world).
The idea of a dedicated plastics treaty has been opposed by some nations in recent years.
But more than 100 countries, including the UK, are said to favour a treaty being proposed at the next UN Environment Assembly in February and March.
Sources say outright opposition is weakening, although there's a dispute as to how strict the treaty should be, and whether it should be legally binding or voluntary.
US President Joe Biden has announced that the US now supports a global agreement, previously resisted by former President Donald Trump. 
It’s not clear, though, whether he can win approval from Congress, as most plastics are made from oil and gas - and they're both produced in the US.
Japan is said to be trying to diminish the ambition of the treaty. The Arab Gulf states and China have been silent so far. China produces most ""virgin plastic"", although the US and UK are said to be the biggest producers of waste per person.
Launching the EIA report, Mr Gammage said: ""The visible nature of plastic pollution has generated huge public concern but the vast majority of plastic pollution impacts are invisible.
""The damage done by rampant overproduction of virgin plastics and their lifecycle is irreversible - this is a threat to human civilisation and the planet’s basic ability to maintain a habitable environment. It’s becoming almost as serious as the threat from climate change.""
Prof Richard Thompson from Plymouth University, an authority on plastics, told BBC News a UN treaty should focus on the full life-cycle analysis of plastics.
He said: ""The underlying cause of the problem is rooted in unsustainable levels of production and consumption.  
""Advocating policies that merely promote the use of plastics that are 'recyclable' won’t be effective unless there’s a local infrastructure to collect, separate, and viably recycle those plastics.
""Polices to promote the use of 'compostable' plastics will only be effective if there is appropriate local infrastructure to handle that waste stream.""
A spokesman for the British Plastics Federation told BBC News: ""Plastic is a lightweight, safe, and energy-efficient material, and simply replacing it with alternatives can often have negative environmental consequences, as well as ramifications for health and safety.
""The unfortunate scenes of plastic waste washing up in oceans around the world are a direct result of improperly managed plastic waste in many areas, and if we want to make a difference, this is where the focus should be.""
Plastics researcher Trisia Farrelly, from Massey University in New Zealand, told BBC News that oil and gas firms, which produce the feedstock for most plastics, were striving to focus attention on plastic waste, rather than the production of plastic altogether.
She said: ""The question now is, what will that treaty look like? Will there be a weak form that focuses on marine litter and waste management? Or will there be a resolution that includes the full life cycle of plastics including extraction and production right through to remediation of legacy pollution?""
She agreed that more science was needed to determine the toxicity of plastics, but argued that delay was dangerous.
""The science is relatively new on a number of plastics pollution impacts and some of the science is complex,"" she said. 
""But there is more than enough evidence to know that we have to act with urgency to prevent further irredeemable damage caused by plastics pollution.""
Hans Peter Arp, chemistry professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, agreed there are many unknowns, but he maintained that plastic pollution was already breaching what’s known as a planetary boundary - a threshold that should not be crossed because of the risk to humankind.
He told BBC News: ""My colleagues and I have argued that plastic pollution fills the three criteria of a planetary boundary threat: 1) increasing exposure, 2) irreversible presence in the global ecosystem, 3) evidence that it is causing ecological harm, and that this harm will increase with plastic emissions. 
""The rational response to the global threat posed by accumulating and poorly reversible plastic pollution is to rapidly reduce consumption of virgin plastic materials, along with internationally coordinated strategies for waste management.""
Although same large firms are resisting tough global rules, others are in support. One group, plasticpollutiontreaty.org, invites firms to sign up to strict standards to ensure a level playing field for plastic business.

Boris Johnson has ""categorically"" denied he was warned a drinks party in the No 10 garden risked breaking lockdown rules.
""Nobody warned me that it was against the rules,"" the prime minister said, adding: ""I would have remembered that.""
Former aide Dominic Cummings says he warned Mr Johnson at the time, and has accused him of misleading MPs about it.
Asked if he would resign if he was found to have misled MPs, Mr Johnson said: ""Let's see what the report says.""
Senior civil servant Sue Gray is due to publish a report into alleged Covid rule-breaking at lockdown get-togethers in Downing Street and government departments.
Ms Gray's team has approached Mr Cummings as part of their inquiry, the BBC has been told. He has said he is willing to answer any questions they may have. 
Six MPs have publicly revealed they have submitted letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson, and the BBC has been told a seventh, Bury South MP Christian Wakeford, has also written to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee.
The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg says a group of about 20 Conservative MPs who were first elected in 2019 have also been meeting to discuss submitting letters to Sir Graham.
If 54 MPs send letters to Sir Graham expressing no confidence in the prime minister, it will trigger a leadership contest.
One MP trying to remove the prime minister told the BBC they thought the threshold could be reached saying: ""I think we've done it, difficult to tell though.""
Our political editor said it was not clear how many of the 2019 intake MPs talking about submitting letters on Wednesday, would go ahead and do it.
A senior MP told the BBC it could be ""a matter of hours"" before things move.
But a cabinet member denied there was a big threat to the prime minister, telling the BBC: ""It will be bumpy, but we'll get through.""
They dubbed the meeting of 2019 MPs the ""pork pie plot"", because one of the attendees was Alicia Kearns, who represents Rutland and Melton (home of Melton Mowbray pies). 
However, colleagues of Ms Kearns say she is not leading a rebellion.
It comes as Mr Johnson made a public apology to the Queen over No 10 parties on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral in April last year.
Appearing to be distressed as he was quizzed about the parties, he said: ""I deeply and bitterly regret that that happened.
""I can only renew my apologies both to Her Majesty and to the country for misjudgements that were made, and for which I take full responsibility.""
On Friday, Downing Street apologised to Buckingham Palace over the two staff parties - which were not attended by Mr Johnson - on 16 April, 2021.
The following day, the Queen sat alone - socially distanced from her family - as she mourned her husband.
In his blog, Dominic Cummings, who was still working in Downing Street at the time of the drinks party on 20 May 2020, claimed the PM had waved aside his warnings. 
Mr Cummings said the idea that a senior aide - the PM's Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds - would not have checked with Mr Johnson, after he was warned his invitation to drinks in the Number 10 garden broke the rules, ""is not credible"".
Two other former Downing Street officials told the BBC they remembered Mr Cummings telling them on that day he had advised the prime minister not to allow the drinks to go ahead.
Asked about Mr Cummings' claims on a visit to a North London hospital, Mr Johnson said: ""I can tell you categorically that nobody said that this was something that was against the rules, that was in breach of the Covid rules.""
You might call it the ""nobody told me"" defence. 
But will a mixture of pleading ignorance and showing contrition be enough for the prime minister?
He was, of course, the person in charge, who decided how we all had to limit our behaviour during the pandemic, so this line of defence opens him up to new attacks. 
Did he understand the rules? Should he have needed someone to point out a breach?
Even if he thought this was a work event, is that enough? - because work events were also prohibited in May 2020.
Sue Gray's inquiry may well find there's no incontrovertible evidence he was, explicitly, told the drinks event in his garden was a breach of the rules. 
But what will voters think?
That will shape what Tory MPs think of their leader. It's a delicate position for a prime minister with already slipping poll ratings.
In his interview, Mr Johnson repeated the apology he made to MPs last week for ""mistakes"" made over the May 2020 get-together.
""As I said in the House of Commons, when I went out into that garden I thought that I was attending a work event."" 
He said he had not seen the email sent by Mr Reynolds inviting staff to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"".
""I only saw it the other day. I only saw it when it emerged,"" said the PM.
""What I remember is going out into that garden for a short time and for 25 minutes thanking staff who'd worked on Covid, who were continuing to work on Covid, and then going back to the office.
""If I had my time again, I would not have allowed things to develop in that way.""
Asked if he had lied to Parliament over the parties, he said: ""No. I want to begin by repeating my apologies to everybody for the misjudgements that I've made, that we may have made in No 10 and beyond, whether in Downing Street or throughout the pandemic.""
Responding to his latest statement, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson clearly knows it's the end of the road. 
""He's the prime minister, he set the rules, he didn't need anyone to tell him that the party he attended broke them.
""If he had any respect for the British public, he would do the decent thing and resign.""
Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the prime minister was ""just making it worse for himself"" with his ""empty excuses"" and ""transparent lies"".
The SNP's deputy Westminster leader Kirsten Oswald said it was ""clear the prime minister was not being frank"" about events in the Downing Street garden.
Cabinet minister have rallied round the prime minister, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak saying ""of course"" he believed Mr Johnson's version of events.
Deputy PM Dominic Raab said prime ministers would normally be expected to resign if they had been found to have misled MPs, but he believed Mr Johnson would remain in power for ""many years"".

Boris Johnson has ""categorically"" denied he was warned a drinks party in the No 10 garden risked breaking lockdown rules.
""Nobody warned me that it was against the rules,"" the prime minister said, adding: ""I would have remembered that.""
Former aide Dominic Cummings says he warned Mr Johnson at the time, and has accused him of misleading MPs about it.
Asked if he would resign if he was found to have misled MPs, Mr Johnson said: ""Let's see what the report says.""
Senior civil servant Sue Gray is due to publish a report into alleged Covid rule-breaking at lockdown get-togethers in Downing Street and government departments.
Ms Gray's team has approached Mr Cummings as part of their inquiry, the BBC has been told. He has said he is willing to answer any questions they may have. 
Six MPs have publicly revealed they have submitted letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson, and the BBC has been told a seventh, Bury South MP Christian Wakeford, has also written to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee.
The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg says a group of about 20 Conservative MPs who were first elected in 2019 have also been meeting to discuss submitting letters to Sir Graham.
If 54 MPs send letters to Sir Graham expressing no confidence in the prime minister, it will trigger a leadership contest.
One MP trying to remove the prime minister told the BBC they thought the threshold could be reached saying: ""I think we've done it, difficult to tell though.""
Our political editor said it was not clear how many of the 2019 intake MPs talking about submitting letters on Wednesday, would go ahead and do it.
A senior MP told the BBC it could be ""a matter of hours"" before things move.
But a cabinet member denied there was a big threat to the prime minister, telling the BBC: ""It will be bumpy, but we'll get through.""
They dubbed the meeting of 2019 MPs the ""pork pie plot"", because one of the attendees was Alicia Kearns, who represents Rutland and Melton (home of Melton Mowbray pies). 
However, colleagues of Ms Kearns say she is not leading a rebellion.
It comes as Mr Johnson made a public apology to the Queen over No 10 parties on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral in April last year.
Appearing to be distressed as he was quizzed about the parties, he said: ""I deeply and bitterly regret that that happened.
""I can only renew my apologies both to Her Majesty and to the country for misjudgements that were made, and for which I take full responsibility.""
On Friday, Downing Street apologised to Buckingham Palace over the two staff parties - which were not attended by Mr Johnson - on 16 April, 2021.
The following day, the Queen sat alone - socially distanced from her family - as she mourned her husband.

245;Tonga tsunami: Before and after eruption;['2022-01-18T14:03:08.000Z'];['By The Visual Journalism Team  '];['volcanoes', 'tsunamis', 'tonga', 'pacific ocean'];['houses', 'sustained', 'extensive', 'island', 'live', 'tsunami', 'islands', 'tonga', 'say', 'remain', 'homes', 'eruption'];"
The massive volcanic eruption and tsunami in Tonga has caused catastrophic damage, with homes destroyed and many communities covered in a thick layer of ash.
The Tongan government says the country has been hit by an ""unprecedented disaster"".
Communications with Tonga have been severely disrupted. 
Satellite images and aerial photographs show the scale of the destruction.
The single undersea cable connecting Tonga to the outside world was severed in the eruption.
The port in the capital, Nuku'alofa on the main island of Tongatapu, has been severely damaged, with many buildings near the waterfront completely flattened. 
It is thought they were destroyed by the tsunami wave when it hit the island, shortly after the eruption on nearby Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai.
Despite the damage on the waterfront at Nukuʻalofa, inland areas are reported to be largely undamaged.
The UN reported extensive damage to property on the western beaches of Tongatapu. 
Waves of up to 15 metres hit the area on Saturday.
Reports from the area say 56 houses were completely or seriously damaged, and that the residents have been moved to evacuation centres.
There is also growing concern for residents of smaller, low-lying islands to the north of Tongatapu.
The authorities in Tonga say all the homes on one island, where around 50 people live, have been destroyed, while on another only two houses remain. Other islands, they say, have sustained extensive damage.
The main airport for the islands, Fua'amotu International Airport, was not damaged, but piles of ash are hindering operations and international aid efforts. Volunteers have been sweeping the runway of the main airport to allow planes to land.
Australia has said the ash must be cleared before it can land a C-130 military plane carrying supplies.
New Zealand is sending two ships, HMNZS Wellington and HMNZS Aotearoa, to the area with water supplies, survey teams and a helicopter.
Little appears to be left of Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai, where the volcanic eruption happened on Saturday. Satellite images show only a small amount of land remains  above  water.

247;Somali survivor: The resilience of living through serial suicide attacks;['2022-01-19T00:07:24.000Z'];['BBC News'];['africa today podcasts'];['spokesman', 'works', 'moalimu', 'ready', 'resilience', 'living', 'attacks', 'tell', 'going', 'filing', 'bbc', 'reports', 'survivor', 'exactly', 'suicide', 'serial', 'somali'];"
Sunday's suicide bombing in Somalia's capital targeted a man who had survived four previous attacks. BBC World Service Africa editor Mary Harper considers why Mohamed Moalimu, who is now recovering in hospital, continues to brave a city wracked by violence.
I have a list of essential information stored on my phone. Right near the top, above my passport number and bank account details, is the name Moalimu, the number 16.5 and the words ""likes blue patterns and white"".
These are the shirt size and preferred colours of my dear friend Mohamed Ibrahim Moalimu, who used to work as the BBC's reporter in Somalia.
Whenever I visit Mogadishu I buy shirts for Moalimu. 
I love going to Jermyn Street in London, the Mecca for posh gentlemen's clothes. I sort through the dozens and dozens of colours, patterns and designs, looking for just the right thing. 
In fact, I have two such shirts waiting in my suitcase for the next time I go to Somalia.
The problem is, Moalimu might not be there. He is in hospital in Turkey. 
He was airlifted there in a little plane. It was not easy to manoeuvre his stretcher up and into the small space.
On Sunday, Moalimu was caught up in his fifth suicide attack. This time he was the direct target. 
A suicide bomber ran towards his car and detonated the explosives when he reached the place where Moalimu was sitting. 
There was little left of the attacker. The car was a mangled wreck.
I do not understand how Moalimu survived. He has a broken leg, chest wounds and other injuries but he is conscious and lucid.
If you were to meet Moalimu, probably the first thing you would notice is the terrible scars on his face. He got those in 2016 in his second suicide attack. 
He was at his favourite seaside restaurant. Fighters from the Islamist al-Shabab militant group stormed in from the beach, besieging the place for hours.
Moalimu survived by lying in his own blood, pretending to be dead. 
He told me how the militants kicked people's bodies to make sure they had died, shooting those who flinched. 
It took months of treatment in Somalia, Kenya and the UK to heal him. The main fear was for his eyes.
It is difficult to relate the character of Moalimu to the dangerous world he lives in, and refuses to leave.
He is gentle, softly spoken and calm. 
Mogadishu, and many of the people in it, are excitable, loud and nervy. Not surprising given that the city has been at war for more than three decades.
I was in Mogadishu shortly after Moalimu was caught up in his first suicide attack. 
It was in June 2013 when al-Shabab smashed their way into a United Nations compound, spending about an hour inside killing as many people as they could.
Moalimu happened to be driving past when the militants struck. The remains of a suicide bomber landed on his car, smashing the windscreen. 
In his usual polite, unassuming way, Moalimu showed me his windscreen, which was well-and-truly smashed up. He drew out a gruesome photo of his car in the aftermath of the attack. 
He asked if I thought the BBC might pay for his windscreen to be repaired.
After all, he was working at the time. Reporting, as he so often did, on the violence in his hometown.
There is no way the BBC could cover Somalia the way it does without people like Moalimu.
He now works as a government spokesman, but when he was with the BBC, as well as filing his own reports, Moalimu was always ready to tell people like me exactly what was going on. 
To this day, whenever I call him, he starts off with a list of exactly what has happened that day - the assassinations, the explosions, the political in-fighting. 
He does this even when the purpose of my call is to ask him what kind of shirts I should bring him.
When Moalimu was my BBC colleague, he and one other person were the only ones I called before I went to Somalia. 
If Moalimu said: ""Don't come"" - I didn't, even if it seemed to be relatively quiet. If Moalimu said: ""Come"" - I came, even if the security seemed a bit ropey. 
I trusted Moalimu with my life. He was one of the unsung heroes of my profession.
I find it hard to understand why so much journalism gets attached to the name of one glorious, brave reporter, when there are often many others involved. 
The producer, the camera-person, the sound-person and, perhaps most important of all, the ""local"" journalist, sometimes called ""the fixer"", who knows pretty much everything and upon whom the team almost entirely depends.
Moalimu was one such person, as are a number of other Somali journalists with whom I work and who also risk their lives every day.
After he left journalism I told Moalimu how disappointed I was when he became the government spokesman. 
How could such a fair, honest journalist join ""the other side""?
As always, his response was measured. 
""I want to make a difference. I couldn't do that as a journalist. I need to work from inside the system. I want to be an MP and this is my first step towards that.""
After he took on his new job, I had to develop a more formal relationship with him. 
His shirts have also become more formal. They are stiff and white as he now needs to wear them with smart suits. 
But whenever I walk down Jermyn Street, I will always think of the joy of choosing shirts for him, trying to match colours and patterns with his serene, gentle character.

248;Should bad science be taken off social media?;['2022-01-19T00:08:42.000Z'];['By Rachel Schraer'];['freedom of expression', 'coronavirus vaccines', 'fake news', 'censorship', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['science', 'harder', 'harmful', 'bad', 'seeking', 'fact', 'taken', 'reduces', 'isnt', 'potentially', 'social', 'media', 'risk', 'reach', 'point'];"
How do you solve a problem like bad information?
When it comes to understanding science and making health decisions, it can have life-or-death consequences. 
People dissuaded from taking vaccines as a result of reading misleading information online have ended up in hospital or even died. 
And inaccurate or completely made-up claims about 5G and the origins of Covid-19 have been linked to violence and vandalism. 
But completely removing information can look a lot like censorship, especially for scientists whose careers are based on the understanding that facts can and should be disputed, and that evidence changes. 
The Royal Society is the world's oldest continuously operating scientific institution, and it is attempting to grapple with the challenges posed by our newest ways of communicating information. 
In a new report, it advises against social media companies removing content that is ""legal but harmful"". Instead, the report authors believe, social media sites should adjust their algorithms to prevent it going viral - and stop people making money off false claims.
But not everyone agrees with that view - especially researchers who are experts in tracking the way misinformation spreads online, and how it harms people. 
The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) maintains there are cases when the best thing to do is to remove content when it is very harmful, clearly wrong and spreading very widely.
The team points to Plandemic - a video that went viral at the start of the pandemic, making dangerous and false claims designed to scare people away from effective ways of reducing harm from the virus, like vaccines and masks, and was eventually taken down. 
Social media companies were better primed for the video's sequel Plandemic 2, which fell flat after being restricted on major platforms, having nothing like the same reach as the first video.  
""It's a political question...what balance we see between individual liberties and some form of restrictions on what people can and cannot say,"" says Prof Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford.
Prof Nielsen acknowledges that, although it's a relatively small part of people's media diets, science misinformation can lead to disproportionate harm.
But, he adds, given a lack of trust in institutions is a big driver of misinformation: ""I imagine that there are quite a lot of citizens who would have their worst suspicions confirmed about how society works, if established institutions took a much more hands-on role in limiting people's access to information.""
Echoing this concern, the Royal Society says: ""Removing content may exacerbate feelings of distrust and be exploited by others to promote misinformation content."" This ""may cause more harm than good by driving misinformation content...towards harder-to-address corners of the internet.""
The fact that those corners are ""harder to reach"", though, is arguably part of the point. It reduces the risk that someone who is not already committed to potentially harmful beliefs, and isn't seeking them out, will be exposed to them by chance.
Some of the violent protests that were driven at least in part by conspiracies had their origin not in obscure corners of the internet, but on Facebook. And there is little clear evidence that removing content drives people further into harmful beliefs. 
Scientific misinformation is nothing new. 
The incorrect belief in a link between the MMR vaccine and autism came from a published (and later retracted) academic paper, while widespread unevidenced beliefs in the harm of water fluoridation were driven by the print media, campaign groups and word of mouth.
What's changed is the speed at which false facts travel, and the huge numbers of people who can end up reading them.
Rather than removing content, one way suggested by the report's authors of tackling misinformation is making it harder to find and share, and less likely to appear automatically on someone's feed.
This video can not be played
This, Prof Gina Neff, a social scientist at the Oxford Internet Institute explained, was to ""ensure that people still can speak their mind"" - they just aren't guaranteed an audience of millions. 
""They can still post this information, but the platforms don't have to make it go viral."" 
The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a think tank which monitors extremism, points out a substantial proportion of misinformation relies on the appropriation and misuse of genuine data and research. 
""This is sometimes more dangerous than outright false information, because it can take substantially longer to debunk by explaining how and why this is a misreading or misuse of the data,"" its spokesperson says. 
That's where fact-checking comes in - another tool which the Royal Society supports.
One of the most common pieces of vaccine misinformation over the past year - which the BBC has repeatedly fact-checked - was the notion that people are being harmed in high numbers by the jab. This claim is based on a misinterpretation of real figures. 
The ISD says research has shown that a small group of accounts spreading misinformation had a ""disproportionate influence on the public debate across social media"".
""Many of these accounts have been labelled by fact-checkers as sharing false or misleading content on multiple occasions, yet remain live.""
The Royal Society did not investigate removing the accounts of ""influencers"" who are especially prolific spreaders of harmful misinformation. 
But this is seen as an important tool by many disinformation experts, and research into ISIS and the far-right suggests it can be successful. 
When David Icke, a prolific spreader of Covid misinformation as well as anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, was removed from YouTube, research from the CCDH found his ability to reach people was considerably reduced.
While his videos remained on alternative video-hosting platform BitChute, their views fell from 150,000 on average before the YouTube ban to 6,711 afterwards. On YouTube, 64 of his videos had been viewed 9.6 million times. 
Research from Cardiff University, found that the de-platforming of Kate Shemirani, a former nurse and prolific spreader of Covid misinformation, decreased her reach in the short term.  
This video can not be played
""Part of the issue is that current models of de-platforming need to be developed. It's not enough to just take down a piece of content, or a small number of accounts,"" one of the paper's authors - Prof Martin Innes - explains. 
Research from organised crime and counter-terrorism shows the need to disrupt the whole network, he says.
But he believes ""this level of sophistication isn't embedded yet"" in the way we tackle disinformation that could put people in danger.

249;5G phones: How serious is the threat to US flights?;['2022-01-18T14:27:50.000Z'];['By Theo Leggett'];['mobile phones', '5g', 'air travel'];['serious', 'aircraft', 'phones', 'used', 'zones', 'threat', 'flights', 'aviation', '5g', 'interference', 'source', 'warned', 'radio'];"
Ten leading US airlines are warning that the imminent rollout of 5G services could be disastrous.
They say the new technology could cause thousands of flights to be delayed, and risks leaving large parts of the US aircraft fleet grounded indefinitely. 
5G relies on radio signals. In the US, the radio frequencies being used for 5G are in part of the spectrum known as C-Band. 
These frequencies are close to the ones used by radio altimeters on aeroplanes, which measure the height of the aircraft above the ground, but also provide data for safety and navigation systems. 
The concern is that interference from 5G transmissions could stop these instruments from working properly, and cause safety problems, particularly when aircraft are coming in to land.
It is potentially very serious. 
In late 2020, the RTCA - a US organisation which produces technical guidance on aviation issues - published a report on the subject. 
It said there was ""potential for broad impacts to aviation operations in the United States, including the possibility of catastrophic failures leading to multiple fatalities, in the absence of appropriate mitigations"".
More recently, the US aviation regulator, the FAA, warned that 5G interference could lead to problems with a number of different systems aboard Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. 
These could make it difficult to slow the plane down on landing, causing it to veer off the runway.
Planes won't be allowed to use radio altimeters in circumstances where there could be a risk of serious interference. 
But that will restrict the ability of some aircraft to land, for example, in poor visibility. 
Airlines for America, which represents 10 major carriers, has warned that this could lead to more than 1,000 flights being delayed or cancelled in bad weather and mean at times ""the vast majority of the travelling and shipping public will essentially be grounded"". 
It has also suggested a large part of the US aircraft fleet will be ""deemed unusable"" because of restrictions on their operation.
Not to the same degree. That's because the way in which 5G is being rolled out varies from country to country. 
In the EU, for example, networks operate at lower frequencies than those which US providers are planning to use - reducing the risk of interference. 5G masts can also operate at lower power. 
Nevertheless, some countries have taken further steps to reduce possible risks. 
In France, there are so-called ""buffer zones"" around airports where 5G signals are restricted, while antennas have to be tilted downwards to prevent potential interference.
Regulators in the US have already taken a number of steps. 
The FAA has established temporary buffer zones around 50 airports, where 5G providers will limit their activities. But these are much smaller than the zones already being used in France, and US transmitters will operate at significantly higher power levels. 
It has also begun identifying which altimeters can be used safely in areas where 5G has been deployed - and those which are not reliable enough and will need to be replaced. 
It has also identified airports where GPS systems can be used to guide approaching aircraft rather than radio altimeters. 
But the airlines insist this isn't enough: they claim the 5G network should not be activated at all within two miles of affected airports.
Verizon and AT&T have already delayed the 5G rollout twice, and have agreed to the temporary buffer zones mentioned above. 
They also pointed out that 5G has already been implemented in some 40 countries.
Last month the US wireless industry body CTIA accused the aviation industry of ""scaremongering"", and warned that delaying the introduction of 5G would cause real economic harm.
UK regulators and airlines do not seem unduly worried. 
In a safety notice published in December, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said that ""there have been no confirmed instances where 5G interference has resulted in aircraft system malfunction or unexpected behaviour"". 
It also stressed that ""different national mobile telecommunication strategies may mean that some [countries] have a higher threat exposure than others"". 
The UK regulator says it plans to work internationally to gather further data on the issue.

The Beijing Winter Olympics app that all Games attendees must use contains security weaknesses that leave users exposed to data breaches, analysts say.
The My2022 app will be used by athletes, audience members and media for daily Covid monitoring.
The app will also offer voice chats, file transfers and Olympic news.
But cybersecurity group Citizen Lab says the app fails to provide encryption on many of its files. China has dismissed the concerns. 
Questions about the app come amid a rise in warnings about visitors' tech security ahead of the Games, which begin on 4 February. 
People attending the Beijing Olympics should bring burner phones and create email accounts for their time in China, cyber security firm Internet 2.0 said on Tuesday. 
Several countries have also reportedly told athletes to leave their main devices at home.
The Citizen Lab report said it had found a ""censorship keywords"" list built into the app, and a feature that allows people to flag other ""politically sensitive"" expressions. 
The list of words included the names of Chinese leaders and government agencies, as well as references to the 1989 killing of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, and the religious group Falun Gong, which is banned in China.
The analysts noted that these features and security flaws are not uncommon for apps in China but posed a risk to users nonetheless. 
Analysts said the ""illegal words"" file appeared currently to be inactive, but it was unclear.
All visitors to the Games are required to download the app 14 days prior to their departure for China, and use it to record daily their Covid status.
For foreign visitors they also need to upload sensitive information already submitted to the Chinese government - like passport details and travel and medical histories.
Citizen Lab said transmission weaknesses in the app's software could lead to easy exploitation of data by a hacker, if targeted.
In a report on Tuesday, Chinese state media outlet Global Times dismissed concerns about the app, saying ""all personal information will be encrypted to ensure privacy"". 
It compared the app to one that had been used at the Tokyo Games. 
Cyber security firm Internet 2.0 has also warned of potential security risks during the Olympics. 
In a report seen by the BBC, it stressed the need for burner phones and reminded people not to use these devices after leaving China 
The report looked at some of the technology sponsors of the Games and their products in order to show ""the sophisticated and broad surveillance culture that exists in China"". 
One product, a VPN by Qi-Anxin, was able to capture a significant amount of user data, the report said. Under China's national security laws, authorities can request to access this data. 
""China's national data security laws are not designed with the Western values of privacy and liberty and do not offer the same level of protection,"" the report said. 
Team USA has encouraged its athletes to use a new device, according to USA Today. 
A bulletin seen by the US outlet allegedly ""encouraged"" burner phones and rental or disposable computers for members of its team. 
""Like computers, the data and applications on cell phones are subject to malicious intrusion, infection and data compromise,"" the bulletin said.

Snow has fallen in the Sahara Desert in north-western Algeria as temperatures plummeted to below freezing.
For children from nearby towns such as Mekalis, it was a welcome relief from the scorching heat of the world's largest hot desert.
The ice crystals formed stunning patterns in the desert sands.
Dunes - ideal for sliding - were also partially covered by snow.
The town of Ain Sefra - known as the gateway to the Sahara Desert - also saw snow. Temperatures in the town often reach 35 degrees Celsius in July and August.
Snow is not entirely unknown in the region, which lies between the desert and the Atlas mountains. 
This month's snow was not entirely surprising - it also happened in 2021, 2018 and 2017.
But the snow on the red sand dunes in December 2016 did come as a surprise. Residents of Ain Sefra said that it was the first time since 1979 they had seen snow, suggesting the phenomenon is now becoming more common.

253;Joe Biden one year on: Has the United States become ungovernable?;['2022-01-19T13:51:50.000Z'];['BBC News'];['us politics', 'long reads', 'joe biden'];['suspect', 'strident', 'ungovernable', 'world', 'voice', 'sympathetic', 'voting', 'united', 'tone', 'day', 'view', 'states', 'biden', 'joe'];"
One of Joe Biden's central election campaign themes was restoring unity to an angry and divided nation. Twelve months after assuming office, things aren't any better, writes Nick Bryant.
Long before the sun had risen over the dome of the US Capitol on the day that Joe Biden was sworn in as president, technicians on the inaugural platform tested the teleprompter he would later read from by scrolling through America's most celebrated sermon: 
""Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure."" 
When I first saw the lines of the Gettysburg Address on those screens in front of the presidential podium, I thought it must be some kind of sick joke. However, the words of Abraham Lincoln could hardly be described as being out of place. Washington, after all, looked that morning like a military encampment. 
Troops had slept overnight in the corridors of Congress to protect it from seditionists, just as their forebears had done in Lincoln's day. The scaffolding of the inaugural platform had been used only two weeks before as a staging post for the January 6th insurrection. The Confederate flag had even been held aloft in the halls of US power, as American once again fought American. 
So the question posed by the country's 16th president seemed especially pertinent as the 46th occupant of the office prepared to assume power - could this country long endure?
Rather than speaking that day of national renewal, a platitudinous staple of presidential inaugurals, Joe Biden focused on national reunification. And though it was three words from his address that instantly entered the history books, ""democracy has prevailed,"" it was three short sentences that set out his presidential mission statement: ""Bringing America together. Uniting our people. And uniting our nation."" 
A year on, however, that plea for national unity sounds more like magical thinking. Far from coming together, the United States is in an even more perilous state of disunion. Often it feels as if the only thing that unites the nation is mutual loathing. America seems to be engaged in a forever war with itself.
Over the past 12 months, tensions have escalated over longstanding points of divergence, such as abortion rights. The country has found new things to argue about, such as vaccine mandates. It has also discovered new ways of fighting old battles. The conflict over critical race theory, the latest front in the country's left-right culture wars, is a novel way of carrying on the centuries-old debate over the legacy of slavery and segregation. 
During the past year, moments with the potential to help bridge divides, namely the conviction of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who murdered George Floyd, have been supplanted by events that ended up hardening divisions. The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager acquitted of murder after shooting dead two men during racial unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was an obvious case in point. 
To those who believed he should be convicted, Rittenhouse was a homicidal vigilante who recklessly waded into a racial protest carrying a military-style semi-automatic weapon. To his supporters, he was a patriot and American hero - one far-right website labelled him ""Saint Kyle"". 
The teenager became the latest poster boy of polarisation. The debate surrounding his trial degenerated into a rage-filled ruckus of overlapping and interlocking arguments about gun control, self-defence laws, policing and double standards in the criminal justice system. As is now the norm in US society, policy questions involving complex and nuanced issues were thrashed out in the midst of a firestorm, often in the most binary and emotive terms.   
On the Richter scale of American division, however, the Rittenhouse trial was only a moderate quake. The aftershocks of January 6th continue to be far more seismic. Rather than becoming a moment of Trumpian repudiation, the Capitol Hill insurrection ended up having a radicalising effect on the conservative movement. The so-called ""big lie"" that Trump won the election, a fringe conspiracy theory in the hours after Joe Biden was declared the victor, has since been adopted as mainstream Republican thinking.
What we are now witnessing is something without precedent in modern America - a former president, who continues to enjoy widespread backing from his party, refusing to accept the result of a clear-cut presidential election. Nor did the assault on democracy, its defenders would argue, end on the night of January 6th.
In the past year, Republican-controlled legislatures in more than a dozen states have passed restrictive voting laws. Laws have also been enacted making it easier to interfere in a partisan way with election administration, part of what Democrats claim is a a slow-motion coup to regain the White House at the next presidential election. Polling suggests, however, that more Republicans think that democracy is under attack than Democrats, another measure of disunity. 
Free and fair elections, the very mechanism designed to peacefully resolve disputes in a civil society, are themselves now at the centre of a society-splitting dispute. And at the core of that row is something even more fundamental, the failure to agree even on incontrovertible facts - in this case the objective truth that Biden won.  How can there be unity, in a country stewing in misinformation and conspiracy theories, when there is no longer a shared sense of reality? Truth is usually a prerequisite of reconciliation. 
Some fear that January 6th was a foreshock, a prelude to an even more deadly eruption. 
That explains the attention being paid to a series of recent books raising the spectre of further civil conflict and political unrest. In How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them, the political science professor Barbara F Walter describes her country as an ""anocracy"", a mix between a democracy and an autocracy, and warns of further militia violence. In Divided We Fall, David French, an Iraq War veteran, fears states might even decide to secede from the union, the precipitant in the mid-19th Century of the American Civil War. The intellectual descendants of the plethora of books written since the turn of the century on US decline, they form part of a new genre - studies devoted to the prospect of American disintegration. 
Few American scholars think the country is on the verge of a full-scale conflagration, a Civil War 2.0, in which compatriots would take up arms against each other on fields of battle that would become modern-day equivalents of Fort Sumter and Antietam.  The more likely scenario, given the uptick in militia activity and the incendiary tone of political discourse, is of sporadic acts of political violence akin to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville or the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Yet even this lesser possibility is alarming.
Late in the  2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden actually travelled to Gettysburg to sound the alarm about the violent potentialities of division. ""The country is in a dangerous place"", he warned, speaking against the backdrop of a battlefield where tens of thousands of Americans ended up as casualties. ""Once again, we are a house divided."" Yet a president who cast himself as a consensus-builder, with bipartisanship in his bones, has not even managed to unite his party, still less his country.
As Biden is well aware, more battles loom on the near horizon. Sometime in 2022, the Supreme Court will deliver its highly anticipated ruling in Dobbs vs Jackson Women's Health Organisation, which could overturn the constitutional right to abortion and lead to an even more balkanised America. The mid-term congressional elections are another potential flashpoint. Even in the event of a conflict with Russia over Ukraine or a clash with China over Taiwan, it is hard to imagine a patriotic surge strong enough to bring the country together. On the contrary, much like the coronavirus pandemic and January 6th insurrection, a military confrontation would more likely expose the nation's fissures.
On inauguration day a year ago, you could almost hear the relief in Joe Biden's voice when he reassured his country, and the world, that democracy had prevailed. But in his two set-piece speeches of this new political year - one marking the anniversary of January 6th and the other delivered in Georgia demanding the passage of voting rights legislation - it was possible to detect both an air of resignation and a strident partisan tone. Both may well be an indication that he knows in his heart of hearts that his reunification project has failed, and that national healing is beyond him. Historians may one day view this as a personal failing. But I suspect many will be more sympathetic. After all, could any president heal a broken land that looks increasingly ungovernable?
Maybe the best that can be hoped for as the country approaches its 250th anniversary on July 4th, 2026, is for it to remain in a state of largely peaceful co-existence: that its cold civil war will never become hot. As for whether the country can long endure? It is still an open question.

Former cabinet minister David Davis has joined calls for Boris Johnson to stand down, telling the prime minister: ""In the name of God, go.""
He said the PM had failed to take responsibility for his actions over lockdown parties in Downing Street. 
Mr Davis's remarks came after backbench Tory MP Christian Wakeford defected to Labour, minutes before Prime Minister's Questions began.
The PM batted away repeated calls to quit during the stormy Commons session.
Mr Davis's criticisms and Mr Wakeford's defection come as Mr Johnson fights to save his premiership after admitting attending a drinks event in Downing Street during the first lockdown.
So far six Conservative MPs have publicly declared no confidence in the PM, but more are thought to have submitted letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, who organises Tory leadership contests.
There are claims that the threshold of 54 letters needed to trigger a no-confidence vote and leadership election could soon be reached, but no official word has been given.
Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, one of those who has called for Mr Johnson to quit, said a no-confidence vote was ""near"" and ""getting closer"". 
But a former cabinet minister told the BBC that Mr Wakeford's defection seemed to be backfiring, as his actions had ""provided an alternative target for rage"" among Tory MPs.
Another Tory MP said he had been ""let down by a good friend"" and that his now ex-colleague had ""unified the party"".
The prime minister is urging fellow Conservatives not to pass judgement on him until a report on parties at No 10, by senior civil servant Sue Gray, comes out next week.
In his letter to Mr Johnson, Bury South MP Mr Wakeford, said: ""You and the Conservative Party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves.""
The last MP to defect from the Conservatives to Labour was Quentin Davies in 2007, when Gordon Brown was prime minister.
At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed Mr Wakeford to his party and repeated his call for Mr Johnson to quit, saying his ""absurd and unreliable defences"" of No 10 parties were unravelling.
But the most dramatic intervention came towards the end of the session, when Mr Davis told Mr Johnson he had spent weeks defending him from ""angry constituents"".
He added: ""I expect my leaders to shoulder the responsibility for the actions they take. Yesterday he did the opposite of that. So, I will remind him of a quotation which may be familiar to his ear: Leopold Amery to Neville Chamberlain.
""'You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. In the name of God, go.'""
A defection is a rare thing. A coup for Labour. A temporary triumph for Sir Keir Starmer. 
There were whispers that Christian Wakeford was spotted talking to a former Labour MP over drinks this week, a few murmurs that he might be thinking about taking such a dramatic step.
But for it to happen, to see that crossing the floor moment, is unusual indeed.
Traditionally a defection can in fact unite the party who the MP has left behind - it's so drastic. 
But the Wakeford departure adds to the real sense of chaos in Westminster. And the reaction among his now former colleagues elected in 2019 may not follow that traditional path. 
Read Laura's analysis in full
The PM said he did not ""know what [Mr Davis] is talking about"", but insisted he took ""full responsibility for everything done in this government and throughout the pandemic"".
Speaking afterwards to the BBC, Mr Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said he had supported Mr Johnson until his interview on Tuesday, when he said he had not been told a party in the Downing Street garden risked breaking Covid rules.
Jake Berry, chairman of the Northern Research Group of Red Wall Tory MPs, most of whom won their seats from Labour at the 2019 general election, said he thought Mr Davis had ""misjudged the mood of colleagues"".
But he added that ""the next few weeks and months"" would prove whether the former minister was correct. 
House of Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg described Mr Davis's message to MPs as ""too theatrical"", telling Channel 4 News he had ""always been a lone wolf"". 
Who else has used the phrase, 'In the name of God, go'?
The phrase was first used by Oliver Cromwell in the 17th Century.
Conservative MP Leo Amery used the words during a Commons debate in 1940, following the UK's failed campaign against Nazi forces in Norway. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigned two days later.
Ms Gray's team are talking to the PM's former aide Dominic Cummings, who says he warned the PM that the Downing Street garden party in May 2020 risked breaking Covid rules.
Mr Cummings has also accused Mr Johnson - who insists he thought the party was a work event - of misleading Parliament.

At PMQs, Sir Keir said the prime minister's defence requires the public to believe that ""as he waded through the empty bottles and platters of sandwiches, he didn't realise it was a party"".
He added: ""If a prime minister misleads Parliament, should they resign?""
Mr Johnson said: ""[Sir Keir] is continuing to ask a series of questions which he knows will be fully addressed by the inquiry. He is wasting this House's time. He is wasting the people's time.""
The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: ""The prime minister is taking the public for fools. Nobody believes him. Will the prime minister finally take responsibility? Resign, go, prime minister.""

259;A68: 'Megaberg' dumped huge volume of fresh water;['2022-01-20T08:08:58.000Z'];['Jonathan Amos'];['earth science', 'earth observation', 'icebergs', 'british antarctic survey', 'climate change', 'oceans'];['water', 'deposition', 'megaberg', 'strong', 'species', 'fresh', 'dumped', 'sensor', 'a68', 'signal', 'think', 'volume', 'huge', 'theres', 'signals', 'really', 'told'];"
The monster iceberg A68 was dumping more than 1.5 billion tonnes of fresh water into the ocean every single day at the height of its melting.
To put that in context, it's about 150 times the amount of water used daily by all UK citizens.
A68 was, for a short period, the world's biggest iceberg.
It covered an area of nearly 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles) when it broke free from Antarctica in 2017. But by early 2021, it had vanished.
One trillion tonnes of ice, gone.
Researchers are currently busy trying to gauge the impact A68 had on the environment.
And a team led from Leeds University has been back through all the satellite data to calculate the behemoth's changing dimensions as it moved north from the White Continent, through the Southern Ocean and up into the South Atlantic.
This has enabled the group to assess varying melt rates during the course of the megaberg's three-and-a-half-year existence.
One of the key periods, obviously, was towards the end, as A68 approached the warmer climes of the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia.

For a while, there were fears the giant block could ground in the surrounding shallows, blocking the foraging routes of millions of penguins, seals and whales.
But it never quite happened because, as the team can now show, A68 lost sufficient depth of keel to stay afloat.
""It does seem that it briefly touched the continental shelf. That's when the berg took a turn and we saw a small piece break off. But it wasn't enough to ground A68,"" Leeds's Dr Anne Braakmann-Folgmann told BBC News.
""And I think you can see why in the thickness estimates,"" added co-author Prof Andrew Shepherd. ""By that stage the berg's keel was 141m, on average, and the bathymetry (depth) charts in the area showed 150m. It was a close call in the end.""
By April 2021, A68 had broken into countless small fragments that were beyond tracking. But its ecosystem impacts will have been much longer-lived. 
Giant tabular, or flat-topped, bergs are now recognised to have considerable influence wherever they roam. 
Their freshwater inputs will alter local currents. And all the iron, other minerals, and even organic matter picked up through their lives and subsequently dropped into the ocean will seed biological production.
The British Antarctic Survey managed to place some robotic gliders in the vicinity of A68 to monitor conditions before the ice mass totally wasted away. 
The data retrieved from these and other instruments, although not yet fully analysed, was revealing some interesting features, said biological oceanographer Prof Geraint Tarling.
""We think there's a really strong signal in the changing flora of the phytoplankton species around A68, and also in the actual deposition of material to the deeper parts of the ocean. The particle sensor on the glider was picking up some very strong signals of deposition coming from the berg,"" he told BBC News.
Details of A68's changing shape and freshwater fluxes are contained in a paper published in the journal Remote Sensing of Environment.

260;Americans assess President Biden's first year in office;['2022-01-20T02:06:20.000Z'];['By Sam Cabral'];['us politics', 'united states', 'joe biden'];['americans', 'unhappy', 'vaccinated', 'wont', 'assess', 'tone', 'taken', 'bidens', 'think', 'president', 'things', 'office', 'sound', 'yelling', 'somebody'];"
As US President Joe Biden marks one year in office on Thursday, Americans are mixed on his performance.
Though he scored early successes by passing pandemic relief and infrastructure bills, Covid-19 has continued to dominate domestic affairs, while his foreign policy record has been blighted by a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.
A growing battle over voting rights is set to shape this year's midterms, and Mr Biden will need to muster all his political strength to lead his party through it.
But only 42% of Americans currently approve of the president's performance, compared to more than half when he took office.
Here's what five Americans from across the political spectrum told us about their commander-in-chief. 
Matthew is a progressive Democrat who was not thrilled to vote for Joe Biden and remains sceptical of how much he can achieve.
He sees Mr Biden's first year as one of ""ups and downs"".
""The biggest problem that continues to face us is the pandemic and unfortunately he's missed the mark. The main goal has been to ramp up vaccine access and I don't think that's proven enough given the record highs in hospitalisations and daily cases now,"" says Matthews.
He thinks Afghanistan has been Mr Biden's biggest failure - despite agreeing with the decision to get out. ""After 20 years, it was clear that American intervention in Afghanistan was not fruitful by any means. But it was a pretty sloppy withdrawal and we all saw that.""
""Very few Afghans were relocated to the US"" in comparison to the number reported to have helped American forces and this was a ""shame"", says Matthew. 
To make the rest of his term a success, Mr Biden must concentrate on expanding the razor-thin Democratic majority in Congress ""so that we're a little less stuck on the whims of one or two senators when advancing key pieces of legislation"", says Matthew. 
Eliana is a Republican who does not identify with Joe Biden's platform and twice voted for Donald Trump.
She thinks Mr Biden ""has created a very poor and weak image for America, especially on the international front"". 
Mr Biden's economic policies ""have resulted in crazy high inflation and that has made everyday life for the American people more difficult"", says Eliana.
It feels like everyone right now is just trying to hunker down and make it by,"" she says. ""I have no idea what these next few years are going to be like. It's just not fair to the American people.""
Eliana does give the president credit for ""making the Covid vaccine accessible to most people regardless of socioeconomic status"" - in her view, his biggest success. 
""But a lot of people have lost their jobs over vaccine regulations and mandates,"" she adds. ""The government shouldn't tell us how to handle our personal health; that is our individual right to choose to take medicine or not.""
She sees his environmental agenda as a failure. ""I am very much about saving our Earth, but he took away a huge part of our economy,"" Eliana says. ""He's making decisions without looking at the bigger picture"".
Going forward, Mr Biden needs to work to make the lives of ordinary Americans better in order for his unity message to succeed, says Eliana.
""He's been in politics for so long and he's never held a normal job so he doesn't even know how to relate to us small people,"" she thinks. ""If he really cared about we the people, he would understand we all have to work together"".
Karen, a Democrat, was excited to cast her ballot for the Biden/Harris ticket because she opposed the direction the country was heading in.
She has mixed feelings about his performance, ""but overall I'm happy"", Karen says. ""I wish he could have gotten a few things - voting rights being the primary one - pushed through, but I think he's trending in the right direction."" 
Like Matthew, she sees Afghanistan as the president's biggest failure so far. ""Afghanistan could have gone a lot smoother, even though I agree with his decision overall,"" she says. ""I wish the administration had a contingency plan ready to go. They were caught a little flat-footed,"" she says.
His biggest success was passing the massive bipartisan $1.2tn infrastructure bill ""which our country so desperately needs"", says Karen. ""If you travel around the US and outside of the US, you understand how low a priority infrastructure has been for many politicians"".
For her, ""passing voting rights legislation and making real huge strides on climate change are critical"" for Mr Biden to focus on going forward.
""Feeling like your vote may not count is something I never thought I would even imagine feeling in this country,"" she says - but that is beginning to happen. ""In 2022, that is a glaring red light Biden has to address.""
An independent frustrated with the country's increasing polarisation, Fred filled out his 2020 ballot for other races but left the presidential section blank.
""I don't think he's doing much to heal the divisions in the country,"" Fred says of Mr Biden.
To him, ""there are various issues that the administration seems unable or unwilling to address"" - from vaccine mandates to the Afghan withdrawal to inflationary pressures. Instead, the messaging is ""getting more hostile and combative"", says Fred. ""So is the opposition.""
Mr Biden inherited a difficult situation, he says, but in terms of solving the problems, ""so far, I'm fairly disappointed"".
He lists the Covid relief package, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, and the appointment of judges as Mr Biden's successes, and ""there's a bit more consistent messaging regarding the pandemic compared to the Trump White House,"" says Fred.
But he has failed to use his success on infrastructure to pass more bipartisan laws, and has been slow to address inflation and supply chain issues, says Fred. 
The administration is not nimble in the face of ""emerging events in the world like in Ukraine and Taiwan"", he says. ""The president needs to step up foreign policy efforts: be less reactive and plan for when things go wrong.""
He also needs to use his political skill to find unity. ""He has an intransigent opposition and there are divisions within his own party,"" says Fred.
""I think he needs to moderate his rhetoric a bit when it comes to things people are unhappy about. The tone being taken with people that can't or won't get vaccinated is not helpful. How often does somebody change their mind because somebody else is yelling at them? It might play well and get good sound bites, but it's not going to persuade people.""
Diane could not bring herself to vote for Donald Trump and, switching from Republican to Democrat, she and her husband both voted for Joe Biden.
She gives Mr Biden credit for ""doing his best with what he's got"". 
""The Republicans are not willing to deal, discuss or debate anything; they just say no to everything. Trump left a real minefield of problems for him, especially in the beginning with Afghanistan and other stuff,"" says Diane.
She agrees with Karen that the infrastructure bill was badly needed, and says Mr Biden's vaccine rollout has been ""extraordinary"".
But he should have spoken up for voting rights ""from the beginning"", says Diane. 
""His last speech on voting rights was probably the most forceful he's been since he became president. I don't know if he was pandering to the more conservative Democrats, but he could have been more aggressive.""
Diane is sceptical that any big legislation can be passed unless Democrats win big in the midterm elections, but outside of passing laws, ""it would be nice if we could get Covid under control"".
Overall ""the behaviour of this entire White House has been presidential"", she says. ""A lot more civilised. No tweets. I'm glad to see that our allies are able to actually talk to and deal with Biden, unlike the last guy.""

261;Tonga volcano: Biblical disaster shakes most Mormon nation in the world;['2022-01-20T00:59:40.000Z'];['By Frances Mao'];['tonga volcano and tsunami', 'tonga', 'new zealand', 'australia'];['main', 'volcano', 'way', 'world', 'disaster', 'outer', 'locate', 'mormon', 'islands', 'shakes', 'phone', 'tonga', 'theres', 'biblical', 'scramble', 'nation', 'restored', 'touch'];"
The South Pacific nation of Tonga has been devastated by a volcanic eruption and subsequent tsunami hitting the shore.
Kilometres underwater, the 15 January explosion ripped apart a deep-sea internet cable - severing the only cord of modern communication connecting 100,000 people to the rest of the world.  
On the streets of the main island Tongatapu, blue skies filled with ash clouds and the loud bangs of the earth cracking open.
Here, in the most Mormon nation in the world, many terrified locals began to pray.
The details of the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai explosion are, after all, on a biblical scale.
And Tonga is a very devout nation. While there are other denominations on the islands, nearly two-thirds (63%) of Tongans belong to or grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, also known as the Mormons, according to the Church's statistics.
The US religious group has been a leading presence on the islands for over a century, since Western missionaries reached its shores and swayed its royal family in the late 19th Century. Per capita, Tonga has the highest number of Church members.
And the Church, with 174 congregations in the community, has taken a prominent role in offering essential shelter and resources to Tongans in the aftermath of the disaster.
Church is an integral part of island life for many locals. All shops and businesses are closed on Sunday in keeping with the day of rest.
But last Sunday, locals were thrust into a state of crisis after the huge natural disaster. The morning after saw soot raining from the sky, leaving a ""black film of black volcanic ash across the land"", according to the Church on its website.
The Church's most senior ecclesial figure on the island, Elder Inoke Kupu, said: ""There is only one colour in Tonga right now, and that is a dark dust.""
Days later, Tonga still remains largely cut off from the outside world, and among the few channels of information coming out are from the diplomatic missions of Australia and New Zealand, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
The Church's chapters in New Zealand say they've been getting all their information from daily satellite phone calls with Elder Kupu, who's been leading the Church's aid and recovery effort on the main island, Tongatapu.
""Drinking water is the immediate need,"" the Church said in its update, echoing what the Red Cross and others have been saying. 
It's reported that about 1,000 people have been taking refuge each night at Liahona High School, one of six Church schools on the island.
""People are sleeping in schools and churches and then going back during the day to clean up their homes and sweep,"" Richard Hunter, a spokesman for the Church based in New Zealand, told the BBC.
""There have been a few less people each night, as more people are staying at their homes, but still, people are relying on that function of the church,"" he said.
The organisation has also handed out thousands of masks to residents to help them breathe amid the blanket of ash. 
Early on in the pandemic, the Church had secured a store of 50,000 masks in anticipation of Covid spreading to the remote nation. Instead, Tonga was hit by a different wave. The tsunami waves - some up to 15m high - have caused significant destruction to many coastal areas.
In the immediate aftermath of the eruption, all efforts are also still on the scramble to locate people. While phone communications on the main island have been restored, there's still no way of getting in touch with the outer islands.
Two Tongan government naval vessels have set off from the capital Nuku'alofa to the outer islands, with one of the Church's senior leaders on board.
The Church - known for its global missionary programme - says it has about 135 Tongan missionaries stationed in those outer islands. While they've been able to make contact with some, there are still many people unaccounted for.
But some encouraging news has emerged already, including ""one happy story"" of survival from Tuesday, Mr Hunter said.
The tiny island of Atata - which has a population of fewer than 100 people - had been flagged by New Zealand and Tongan government authorities as one of the islands of greatest concern as it was closer to the explosion.
Almost all of the homes on the island were destroyed when the volcano erupted. But everyone managed to get to the Church's chapel house in time, which survived.
""Everyone on the island stayed in the church building and were safe, but every other building we understand was destroyed, except for this one in the middle of the island,"" Mr Hunter said.
He said the Church's properties are built ""as strong as we can build them"", because ""we know we're in a dangerous part of the world where a cyclone or tsunami can come through every few years or so"".
""So our members know they can go to their nearest church when the wind is very strong, to take refuge from the storms of life"" - in this case, both in a spiritual and physical sense.
New Zealand authorities confirmed on Wednesday that the residents on Atata had been successfully evacuated to Tongatapu island. 
Mr Hunter said additional air cargo shipments of water, masks and phones are also on the way from the Church's chapters overseas, but like the official aid being sent by governments and the Red Cross, it's being held up by the damage to Tonga's air and sea ports.
""Church leaders continue to liaise with government officials so the Church can support humanitarian efforts in the coming days and weeks,"" the Church wrote on its website.
""Church services this coming Sunday will be home-based and Latter-Day Saints will be invited to fast and pray, to give thanks for the many lives which have been preserved, and to plea for a return to normality.""

262;Covid: Did Pfizer's boss cast doubt on his own vaccine?;['2022-01-20T00:06:51.000Z'];['By Rachel Schraer'];['coronavirus vaccines', 'reality check', 'pfizer'];['small', 'taking', 'cast', 'risk', 'sideeffects', 'vaccine', 'pfizers', 'supported', 'boss', 'valid', 'stronger', 'doubt', 'covid', 'unsafe', 'rare'];"
""I've never doubted Covid-19 vaccination... until now.""
Jerome doesn't follow news closely on Twitter, using the site mainly to tweet about sports and books he's enjoying. 
The 41-year-old bus driver, from Quebec has mostly supported local Covid restrictions, although he admits to growing ""fed up"", two years into the pandemic. 
His feed reveals him mildly grumbling about his children's home-schooling, among posts about favourite authors and Canada's national football team. 
But casually scrolling on the social-media site, one Monday early in the new year, he came across a video clip appearing to show the head of Pfizer suggesting his vaccine provided no protection at all against Omicron.
Albert Bourla could be seen saying: ""We know that the two doses of the vaccine offer very limited protection, if any."" 
Jerome tweeted: ""If this video is legit, it has to sound off some alarms somewhere, no?""  
But the clip had been taken out of context from a longer interview, with Yahoo Finance, in which Mr Bourla had been discussing high infection rates with Omicron. 
A Pfizer representative clarified he had been referring to research suggesting while ""two doses of [Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid vaccine] may not be sufficient to protect against infection with the Omicron variant"", vaccinated people were thought to still be protected against severe disease. 
Several studies suggest vaccines, even when they do not protect against infection, lessen the impact of the Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa, and significantly reduce the chances of ending up in hospital or dying. 
Jerome told BBC News he was generally wary of things he saw online, and on looking into the video further had realised the clip was a ""small part of the whole interview"".
""It was clear to me that small clip probably shouldn't be taken into account to shape my conclusion,"" he said.
But he had ""almost slipped into being manipulated"". 
""I was really surprised and shocked, you know, I just almost couldn't believe what I was hearing,"" Jerome said.
And from that brief window during which he'd expressed doubts about vaccination, his account was flooded with comments from people he characterised as the ""anti-vax community"".
""I have never had so many notifications on my Twitter,"" he said.
""People were telling me things like, 'Oh, well, you know, it's about time you wake up.'""
Jerome was also sent countless links to further misinformation, claiming ""unbelievable side-effects from the vaccines"".
As is common online, people were taking valid points - the vaccine isn't very good at protecting against catching Omicron or it comes with a very small risk of extremely rare side-effects - and making big leaps to much stronger claims - the vaccine is unsafe or completely ineffective - not supported by the evidence.
Posts also left out crucial information - in vaccinated populations people have much milder infections or the virus itself comes with much greater risk than the vaccine of side-effects, including blood clotting, heart inflammation and death. 
Many posts also made promises of fellowship and community, calling him ""brother"". Jerome describes himself as living a happy and contented life - but can see how someone seeking ""that sense of belonging"" could be more easily swayed.
""It made me realise how easily people are manipulated through false sources of information,"" he said. 
In an online newsletter, writer Jordan Schachtel quoted part of Mr Bourla's comments to imply two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine now offered only ""very limited protection, if any"" against Covid-19.
The tweet Jerome initially saw casting doubt on the vaccine, appears to have referenced this newsletter.
Other social-media posts, videos and podcasts also directly referenced Mr Schachtel's newsletter but took it further, suggesting Mr Bourla's comments cast doubt on whether the vaccine was ""safe and effective"".
Several posts also referred to unrelated comments by Mr Bourla, on the US news channel CNBC, that vaccines ""don't have the safety profile that we hope we can achieve with [mRNA] technology"". 
However, on this occasion, he had not been talking about Covid vaccines at all.
A full transcript of the interview clearly shows Mr Bourla was talking about another vaccine - against the shingles virus - Pfizer plans to update.
Mr Schachtel's newsletter initially made this mistake and later corrected it - but not before these comments had been picked up by former US congressman Ron Paul, who has a large social-media following.
In a YouTube video, Mr Paul explicitly referenced Mr Schachtel's newsletter when he repeated claims Mr Bourla had said the Covid vaccine was not safe and provided no protection against Omicron. 
Claims Pfizer had ""admitted... current vaccines 'do not work'"" or ""offer 'zero' protection against Covid-19"", linking to Mr Paul's YouTube clip, then spread across numerous online platforms.
Research by independent scientists and public health experts has shown the positive impact vaccinations are having in preventing serious illness - particularly against the Omicron variant.
One study suggests people three months after a second vaccine dose are 70% less likely to develop severe disease from an Omicron infection, dropping to 50% after six months.
Another has found double-vaccinated people are 65% less likely to be admitted to hospital with Omicron than those unvaccinated. 
Also, many countries with high rates of vaccination have been experiencing very high Covid infection levels but far fewer deaths than during previous peaks.

263;Apple AirTags - 'A perfect tool for stalking';['2022-01-20T00:13:46.000Z'];['By James Clayton  & Jasmin Dyer'];['apple'];['airtags', 'rang', 'tool', 'support', 'perfect', 'know', 'apple', 'watch', 'closely', 'surroundings', 'device', 'stalking', 'confirm', 'didnt', 'told'];"

Amber Norsworthy lives in Mississippi with her four children.
It had just turned 3pm when she got home on 27 December. She received a notification on her phone. 
""My phone made a ding that I'd never heard before"", she says.
The notification told her that an unknown device had been following her movements. 
Ms Norsworthy, who's 32, went on to the 'Find My' app on her iPhone. 
""It showed me my whole route. It said 'the last time the owner saw your location was 15:02' and I was like, 'that's now, I'm at home'."" 
She rang the police, who told her they didn't know what to do. She has yet to find the device, which she believes is somewhere in her car. She says Apple Support was able to confirm it was an AirTag. ""I watch my surroundings very closely now,"" she says.
The BBC has spoken to six women in the US who say they have been tracked using Apple AirTags. 
The button-sized devices are designed to work with Apple's 'Find My' network to locate lost items. But there have been multiple reports in the US of the devices being used to track people. 
Apple told the BBC: ""We take customer safety very seriously and are committed to AirTag's privacy and security.""
The company also says AirTags have better security features than rival products. However, there is growing evidence that they are being used for criminal activity across the US.
Apple launched AirTags last April. They're small, smooth and circular - and took inspiration from other tracking products on the market, like Tile.
The idea is that they can be attached to luggage or keys - anything you could lose. You can track an item to within 0.1ft. But in the wrong hands, they can be used for a different purpose.
""If you create an item which is useful for tracking stolen items, then you have also created a perfect tool for stalking,"" says Eva Galperin, Director of Cyber-Security at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. 
""I have personally talked to several people who have found AirTags in their possession,"" she says.
Apple was aware, long before it released AirTags, that they could be used for criminal activity. On releasing them, Apple said that ""AirTags are designed to track items not people"". 
They created a series of safeguards that, they said, would protect people from being tracked. 
People with an iPhone would be alerted if an unregistered AirTag was moving with them. And the AirTags would make a beeping noise when separated from an owner for a period of time.
In December, the company also released an app which Android users can download. ""Device Tracker"" allows users who aren't on the iOS operating system to be notified of a rogue AirTag.
But for several reasons, many people believe these safeguards don't go far enough. 
Anna Mahaney is from Georgia. She was alerted to an unknown device after she'd gone to the shopping mall. 
""I was pretty freaked out and I went to try to disable it. Every time I did that, it said it couldn't connect to the server."" She went to an Apple Store, where they suggested she should turn off her location settings. 
When she went to the local police, they told her there had been another similar report in her area. She believes the device is somewhere on her car.
The BBC has spoken to six women who all say they have been tracked with AirTags. One said she had found an AirTag taped to the inside of a bag. Others haven't been able to locate the tags.
All of them have questions about whether Apple is doing enough to stop their products from tracking people. 
Apple says AirTags will make a beeping sound between 8-24 hours after a device is detected moving with an unregistered phone. But it's easy to register an AirTag, and then disable it.
Anna Mahaney says Apple Support told her this could be why she hasn't been able to find the AirTag: ""It looks like what could have happened in my case was that the person that owns the AirTag tracked me until I got home, and then they turned off the AirTag.""
This isn't the only potential loophole in Apple's AirTag safeguards. Apple's app, designed for Android users to find an unwanted AirTag, has been downloaded by a tiny percentage of Android phones
The BBC asked Apple for figures on how many times the app has been downloaded on Google Play, Android's default app store. Apple didn't say, but Google Play puts the figure at around 100,000 downloads. To put that into context, there are around 3 billion active Android devices around the world.
Apple says that if you don't have an iPhone, people will be notified with another safeguard - a beeping sound that plays after an unwanted AirTag is detected. But there are problems with this too. 
""AirTags emit a 60 decibel beep. and it's really easy to muffle."" says Eva Galperin. ""I could muffle it just by closing it in my fist. I could muffle it by putting it between two couch cushions. It's impossible to hear by putting it, say, under your car bumper."" 
And the noise will only begin to play after eight hours. Critics argue that by then it is too late. 
In Bloomingdale Illinois, one police force has warned local residents about AirTags: ""We thought it was important to notify the people in our community that this is somewhat of an issue."" says Frank Giammarese, director of public safety at Bloomingdale Police. 
""Technology is great but unfortunately... some people have misused that."" 
There is an argument that Apple is being unfairly targeted. It's easy to buy tracking devices on the internet. 
The BBC asked its major competitor, Tile, what it was doing to protect the public from being tracked with its devices. Tile replied that it was ""developing a solution"" which would identify an unknown device near people. But that solution hasn't been released yet. 
The counter-argument is that AirTags are just very good at being located by a registered iPhone. The 'Find My' network uses almost a billion Apple devices around the world - and their Bluetooth connectivity - to create accurate and long-range tracking.
""I want Apple to require these devices to ask permission before you can be followed,"" says Anna Mahaney. ""With 'Find My Friends', if my husband wants validation, I have to okay that and give it to him. I cannot rationalise why a stranger can follow me and I don't have to give consent."" 
Amber Norsworthy believes AirTags should not be sold until Apple can work out how to better alert people: ""They should stop selling them for a period of time until they can work out some safety boundaries.""
Eva Galperin believes Apple needs to create better safeguards: ""I want them to work with Google in order to give Androids the same level of detection automatically in the background, as they already have for iPhones.""
The BBC put these criticisms to Apple, who said: ""We take customer safety very seriously and are committed to AirTag's privacy and security…If users ever feel their safety is at risk, they are encouraged to contact local law enforcement, who can work with Apple to provide any available information about the unknown AirTag.""

265;Omicron: Is racism why South African evidence of milder infection was ignored?;['2022-01-20T00:08:25.000Z'];['By Andrew Harding'];['south africa', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['seeing', 'milder', 'omicron', 'sheer', 'african', 'werent', 'racism', 'ignored', 'rigorous', 'sufficiently', 'south', 'scientific', 'infection', 'scientifically', 'worst', 'evidence', 'research'];"
South African scientists - praised internationally for first detecting the Omicron variant - have accused Western nations of ignoring early evidence that the new Covid variant was ""dramatically"" milder than those which drove previous waves of the pandemic.
Two of South Africa's most prominent coronavirus experts told the BBC that Western scepticism about their work could be construed as ""racist,"" or, at least, a refusal ""to believe the science because it came from Africa"".
""It seems like high-income countries are much more able to absorb bad news that comes from countries like South Africa,"" said Prof Shabir Madhi, a vaccine expert at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand. 
""When we're providing good news, all of a sudden there's a whole lot of scepticism. I would call that racism.""
Prof Salim Karim, former head of the South African government's Covid advisory committee and vice-president of the International Science Council agrees.
""We need to learn from each other. Our research is rigorous. Everyone was expecting the worst [about Omicron] and when they weren't seeing it, they were questioning whether our observations were sufficiently scientifically rigorous,"" he said, while acknowledging that the sheer number of new mutations in Omicron may have contributed to an abundance of scientific caution.
South Africa's latest wave of Covid, which began in late November 2021, is now declining as sharply as it once rose and is likely to be declared over, nationwide, in the coming days. 
There are still concerns that the infection rate could spike again following the reopening of schools, but, overall, the country's Omicron wave is expected to last half as long as previous waves.
By early last month, scientists and doctors here were already sharing anecdotal evidence indicating that Omicron, while highly contagious, was resulting in far fewer hospital admissions or deaths than the Delta wave.
""The predictions we made at the start of December still hold. Omicron was less severe. Dramatically. The virus is evolving to adapt to the human host, to become like a seasonal virus,"" said Prof Marta Nunes, senior researcher at the Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Analytics department of the University of Witwatersrand.
The WHO continues to warn against calling Omicron ""mild,"" pointing out that its high transmissibility was causing a ""tsunami"" worldwide, threatening to overwhelm health systems. 
But South African scientists are sticking by their data.
""The death rate is completely different [with Omicron]. We've seen a very low mortality rate,"" said Prof Karim, who pointed to the latest data showing hospital admissions were four times lower than with Delta, and the number of patients requiring ventilation was similarly reduced.
""It didn't take even two weeks before the first evidence started coming out that this is a much milder condition. And when we shared that with the world there was some scepticism,"" Prof Karim added.
It has been argued that Africa - or at least some parts of the continent - may be experiencing the pandemic differently due to demographics and other factors. South Africa's average age, for instance, is 17 years younger than the UK's. 
But scientists in South Africa insist that any demographic advantage the population might have in terms of battling Covid is outweighed by poor health. Excess deaths in South Africa during the pandemic now sit at 290,000 - or 480 per 100,000 people - which is more than double the UK figure. 
""The fact is that South Africa has got a much more susceptible population than the UK when it comes to severe disease. Yes, we've got a younger population… but we've got an unhealthier population because of a higher prevalence of other co-morbidities including obesity and HIV,"" said Prof Madhi.
""Each situation and each country has some unique characteristics. But we've learned how to extrapolate from one setting to another,"" said Prof Karim.
The figure of 290,000 excess deaths has not been confirmed as an accurate reflection of the pandemic's toll in South Africa. It is three times the number of official Covid-19 deaths. 
But scientists here believe a majority of those excess deaths are probably due to the pandemic. Half of them occurred during the Delta wave, but, so far, only 3% transpired during the Omicron wave, said Prof Madhi.
South Africa's government declined to introduce tighter restrictions during the Omicron wave and bitterly criticised foreign governments for their initial imposition of strict travel bans from the region. 
Scientists here have generally welcomed the government's light-touch response, and now argue that other countries might do well to follow its example.
""We believe the virus is not going to be eradicated from the human population. We must now learn how to live with this virus and it will learn how to live with us,"" said Prof Nunes.
""The [low death rate from Omicron] shows we're in a different phase of the pandemic. I'd refer to it as a convalescent phase,"" said Prof Madhi. 
He observed that South Africa had, ""for all intents and purposes"", stopped quarantining and contact tracing, and he urged the government to stop testing for Covid-19 at a community level too, saying it was unnecessary and amounted to pointless ""bean counting"". 
Instead, he said the priority should be to minimise the number of people who are hospitalised by Covid-19. 
Prof Madhi also expressed concern that mixed messages about South Africa's growing success in fighting the pandemic could ""really diminish confidence in vaccines [despite the fact that] we know vaccines prevent severe disease"".
Although South Africa lags far behind countries like the UK in terms of vaccination rates, at least three-quarters of the population now enjoys significant protection from a combination of prior infections and vaccinations. 
Prof Karim acknowledged that Omicron's high transmissibility was causing temporary problems for countries like the US, but, citing South Africa's own experience, he said ""the good thing is that because [the infection rate] has gone up that fast, it'll go down that fast too, so the pressure on hospitals will be much less"".
50 years on, can the mystery be solved?

267;Elza Soares: Tributes as Brazilian samba legend dies aged 91;['2022-01-21T02:20:43.000Z'];['BBC News'];['brazil'];['rest', 'statement', '91', 'musical', 'brazilian', 'elza', 'world', 'aged', 'thousands', 'soares', 'dies', 'samba', 'tributes', 'remain', 'legend', 'wanted', 'sung'];"
Elza Soares, one of the greatest Brazilian singers of all time, has died aged 91 at her home in Rio de Janeiro, her publicist says. 
Often called the queen of Brazilian samba, she released more than 30 albums in a career that spanned six decades. 
Soares also used her music to campaign against racism and other forms of discrimination.
Her family said she died of natural causes and called her a musical icon who moved people with her voice.
""The beloved and eternal Elza has gone to rest but she will remain in musical history and in our hearts and those of thousands of fans all around the world,"" their statement said. ""As Elza Soares wanted, she sung until the end."" 
Born into poverty in the favelas of Rio De Janeiro in 1930, much of Soares life was scarred by tragedy. 
Her father forced her to marry at the age of 12 and within a year she had given birth to her first child. 
She had seven children with her first husband, at whose hands she suffered frequent abuse, but the first two were born prematurely and died young.
Her husband died when she was 21 and she later confessed to stealing food to feed her young family. 
She later married the Brazilian footballer Garrincha, with whom she had a son who died aged nine. The marriage lasted 17 years and she supported him during his battle with injuries and alcoholism at the end of his career.
But despite her personal hardship, her success as a musician spanned decades and her talent was appreciated by figures including the Queen, whom Soares met during a 1968 visit to Brazil. 
The British Embassy in Brazil celebrated the meeting on Twitter, saying Soares had impressed the British monarch with her voice and presence and calling it ""a meeting of Queens"". 
An outspoken figure, she never forgot the racism she faced performing in bars and saloons during her early career, and has been celebrated for her work championing social and racial justice in Brazil. 
""Racism still continues, but we are going to fight it and we will make progress. Racism is a sickness,"" she said in an interview last year to mark her 90th birthday. 
Her life and achievements have been celebrated by a host of figures across Brazilian society. 
Brazil's former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said the country had lost not only one of its most potent voices ""but also a great woman, who always defended democracy and good causes"".
The former Brazilian footballer Pelé, a teammate of her late husband, called Soares a ""legend of our music, historic, genuine, unique and unparalleled. Today she leaves us, but in the heart, she will always be eternal"". 
Meanwhile, Eduardo Paes, the Mayor of Rio, said that he will declare ""an official 3-day mourning period in Rio for the loss of this great carioca! Woman! Warrior! Elza Live!""

At least 17 people have been killed in a huge explosion near a mining town in western Ghana, officials say.
Police say a vehicle carrying mining explosives collided with a motorcycle near the town of Bogoso.
Images shared by local media showed a large plume of black smoke rising above destroyed buildings and scattered debris as residents call for help.
Graphic videos showed mutilated bodies of victims. A large crater can also be seen beside a road.
At least 59 people were injured, some of whom were in a critical condition, Information Minister Kojo Oppong Nkrumah said.
Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo said the military had joined emergency efforts to help ""contain the situation"", and the country's disaster management agency had been tasked with bringing ""rapid relief"" to residents. 
""It is a truly sad, unfortunate and tragic incident,"" he tweeted. 
In an emergency notice, police said the ""huge explosion"" had occurred between Bogoso and the village of Bawdie.
Rescue efforts were under way and people have been told to move out of the area. 
Police called on nearby towns to ""open up their classrooms, churches etc to accommodate surviving victims"".
""We continue to urge the public to remain calm as we manage the situation.""
A team of police and army explosion experts were deployed to ""avoid a second explosion"" and secure the scene, the government said.

269;Franco Mulakkal: Hundreds write to Kerala nun who lost rape case against bishop;['2022-01-21T00:51:06.000Z'];['By Geeta Pandey'];['sexual violence', 'rape in india', 'india'];['write', 'judge', 'franco', 'hundreds', 'order', 'sexual', 'survivor', 'nuns', 'case', 'kerala', 'bishop', 'need', 'narrated', 'rape', 'underwent', 'mulakkal', 'nun', 'supported', 'lost'];"
Letters of support have been pouring in for an Indian nun after a bishop she had accused of repeatedly raping her was cleared by a trial court last week.
For the past two days, my social media timeline has been full of handwritten messages of support for the 50-year-old nun  who had accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal of raping her 13 times between 2014 and 2016. 
Most of the posts are from women, including activists, feminists, journalists and celebrities in the southern state of Kerala and many contain hashtags such as #withthenuns and #avalkoppam - a Malayalam-language word which means ""with her"".
The letters pledge support to ""the nun in her fight for justice"" - sometimes they just carry words of encouragement or snatches of poetry, or contain drawings and artwork.
""In these dark times, you are that ray of hope to millions,"" one wrote quoting Emily Dickinson. Another quoted from Still I Rise, Maya Angelou's poem that's become an anthem for feminists across the world.
Many wrote in saying they ""believed"" her words even though the trial court judge did not.
The accusations of rape against Bishop Franco have made headlines in India. The case shocked one of the country's oldest Christian communities and sparked widespread protests after the nun alleged that the Catholic Church had ignored her complaints. 
A powerful priest, Bishop Franco was arrested only in 2018 after a group of nuns sat on a hunger strike outside the Kerala high court. The Vatican temporarily relieved him of his duties. A month later, he was freed on bail. 
Over the years, the woman had been shamed on social media and one local politician was chastised by the National Commission for Women after he described her as a ""prostitute"".
Bishop Franco denied the charges against him and last Friday a trial court in Kottayam city found him not guilty. 
Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) G Gopakumar said there were ""exaggerations and embellishments in the statement of the victim"" and the prosecution had failed to prove the charges against the bishop. He also spoke of rivalry in the church.
""When it is not feasible to separate truth from falsehood, when grain and chaff are inextricably mixed up, the only available course is to discard the evidence in toto. This court is unable to place reliance on the testimony of the nun... so I acquit the accused,"" he added. 
The verdict shocked many, but once the 289-page order became publicly available, it led to massive outrage in India with many pointing out that the judge seemed to be questioning the woman's conduct and moral character.
""When I read the judgement, I was shell shocked. I have only two words to describe it: judicial porn,"" historian and feminist researcher J Devika told the BBC.
""The order was not just to exonerate the bishop, it was also to demoralise the survivor and the other nuns who had supported her. It contains graphic descriptions of sexual acts and assault as narrated by the nun. The judge even details a breast examination she underwent. What was the need for any of that?"" she added.
A former Kerala high court judge called the verdict ""a clear case of miscarriage of justice"" and many activists and lawyers criticised it for focusing on the woman's conduct. 
Many asked if there was an appropriate way for rape victims to behave and the case drew comparisons with the acquittal last year of former magazine editor Tarun Tejpal that led to accusations of victim shaming. 
In the case of the Kerala nun too, ASJ Gopakumar asked why she had not stayed back at her sister's home after attending a religious event there but returned to the convent with the accused.
The Indian Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that in rape cases, the judges must not comment on the behaviour or character of the woman and the only question they should ask is - did the accused commit rape?
""But you get the sense the nun was on trial here,"" says Ms Devika. 
""The judge completely ignored the social setting in which the alleged crime happened. In the church, even the senior-most nun has to defer to the junior-most priest. And Bishop Franco is a very powerful man. But the judge overlooked that power dynamic."" 
Now as the state readies to appeal against the order in the high court, there has been an outpouring of support for the nun.
""Some of us came together and said let's do something to support her and five other sisters who have been helping her, to keep their morale up,"" said Athira Sujatha, a public policy professional and activist and one of the organisers of the letter-writing campaign.
On Wednesday morning at 11am - the exact time on Friday when ASJ Gopakumar had pronounced his order in court - Athira posted a letter on Instagram announcing the campaign.
""Your steadfast support to upholding justice by talking truth to power has been an extraordinary feat of hope and courage - not just to the survivor in this particular case but to survivors, bystanders and witnesses everywhere,"" she wrote.
Within two hours, she told the BBC, they had received about 200 letters. In 24 hours, their numbers had exceeded 1,000. Many others shared their letters on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
Many addressed their letters to ""Sister X"" (the nun) while many expressed gratitude to the ""Sisters"" - five nuns who have been a pillar of support for her.
Many of them wrote about their personal experiences, saying that the nun's fight had given them the courage to speak out too.
""Girls like me across this seemingly unjust land are praying for you... You are loved, respected and honoured. There 'will' be light at the end of this really dark tunnel,"" wrote popular singer Chinmayi Sripada. 
Filmmaker Geetu Mohandas wrote: ""It will by no means be an easy task, but you can, and indeed you will, survive this journey.""
One woman drew pencil sketches of the nuns with a message in Malayalam applauding them: ""Your courage and persistence is unparalleled. No movement to get justice is a lost cause.""
Athira says when they put out the message asking people to mail their letters, they were apprehensive about what sort of letters they would get. 
""But we have not received one single negative message. People understand that the sisters need our support and they are all offering encouragement and solidarity.""
In her letter written in Malayalam, Ms Devika compared the sisters to fireflies.
""There may be sceptics who say that the fireflies cannot beat the night... Please tell them... If millions of fireflies get together, they may beat this unending night,"" she wrote.

270;Like a drone that you sit in – but would you feel safe?;['2022-01-21T01:11:52.000Z'];['By Chris Baraniuk'];['transport', 'drones', 'air travel'];['drone', 'power', 'tetra', 'vehicle', 'feel', 'wings', 'uses', 'theres', 'sell', 'ultralight', 'sit', 'safe', 'rotors', 'person'];"
Peter Ternstrom was about nine years old when he first saw the movie, Return of the Jedi, at the cinema. The scene in which Luke and Leia take to hover-bikes on a high-speed chase through a forest left a particular impression on him.
""Absolutely, that has been an important inspiration for me,"" says Mr Ternstrom, who co-founded Swedish firm, Jetson with Tomasz Patan.
Recently,  his company released a video of its prototype personal flying machine, the Jetson ONE, in action. The clip quickly clocked more than 12m views on YouTube in about four weeks.
The filming location, a desert-like area, was deliberately chosen for its sci-fi feel. It is actually a military training ground in Poland.
A helmeted pilot sits in the centre of what looks like a large drone, with its multiple spinning rotors. The craft zooms across the landscape, blowing up dust. 
This is an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL. Personal eVTOLs are among the smallest rideable aircraft around and generally have capacity to transport just one passenger - the pilot. 
The vehicle's diminutive size helps to keep down their price tag but there is another advantage for firms seeking to sell them. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says that ultra-light vehicles - which weigh less than 254lbs (115kg) and have a maximum speed of 55kts (63mph; 101km/h) - can be flown without a pilot's certificate. 
This is the route that Jetson and a number of other firms are taking in order to get their products on to the market. But will these new-fangled flying machines actually be safe, especially if just about anyone can buy one?
Mr Ternstrom for one, is being slightly more cautious than he's legally required to be. The first Jetson ONEs will sell in 2023, if all goes to plan, but the founder says he wants the first owners to be people who hold, or who have held, a pilot's licence.
""If you have previous experience, we have said, 'OK, cool, you can buy one',"" he explains. These people will be ""ambassadors"" for the brand, he says. Everyone who buys one, for $92,000 (£77,000), will also get a two-day training course in Tuscany, Italy.
There has certainly been lots of interest from prospective owners. Three and a half weeks after the firm published its video, Jetson had taken pre-orders for 118 aircraft.
The Jetson ONE currently offers 20 minutes of flight time on a fully charged battery. But in a couple of years' time, Mr Ternstrom predicts this will rise to 30 minutes, thanks to better battery technology. As for safety, the drone is built with crumple zones around the pilot's seat to cushion the impact of a low-altitude crash. 
The vehicle can also continue flying after losing one of its propellers - though pilots in such situations will be prompted to land immediately. 
Plus, on-board software will attempt to automatically prevent dangerous flying behaviour. The software slows the vehicle down as it approaches the ground, for instance, and uses a Lidar (light detection and ranging) system to sense how far away the ground actually is.
But Mr Ternstrom knows that there is still the potential for things to go wrong, which is partly why he has stipulated that the first owners must have some flying experience.
""This is a machine made for mischief, basically,"" he adds. ""I want them to be very responsible.""
More technology of business:
No eVTOL aircraft are currently certified to fly in the UK, though the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) expects that the first flights of such vehicles could begin within five years - and this is likely to be for commercial rather than personal operation. 
""With that in mind, it is vital that a strong safety culture is built into the heart of eVTOL vehicles,"" says David Tait, head of innovation at the CAA.
The Jetson ONE is far from the only vehicle of its kind in development. The US-based company Opener will also soon bring its aircraft, the single-seater BlackFly, to market. 
A spokeswoman for the firm says safety is Opener's first priority. ""General adoption of eVTOL technology is not possible without it,"" she adds. New owners will have to take a training course before the company allows them to fly.
There's also the TeTra Mk5, which uses a combination of rotors and fixed wings to power itself. It also carries just one person but is too heavy to be classed as ultralight. However, it comes as kit-aircraft so must be assembled by the new owner, meaning that TeTra can sell the vehicle in the US, at least, without having to obtain full aircraft certification.
""That's why we're producing the kit planes,"" says Tasuku Nakai, chief executive at TeTra.
Some companies however, are going for full aircraft certification which can be a long process. Including AIR, an Israeli firm, which is designing a two-seater eVTOL. Chief executive and co-founder Rani Plaut says his company has been working with the FAA for nearly two and a half years. The certification process takes so long partly because electric propulsion is a relatively new frontier for flying machines, he says.
AIR's vehicle, the AIR ONE, is designed to continue flying even if it loses one rotor, or a battery, for example. 
""If worst comes to worst, we have a ballistic parachute system,"" says Mr Plaut. He says the firm aims to deliver its first vehicles to customers in 2024, pending FAA certification.
Many of these vehicles still require hundreds of hours of test flights, to ensure they fly as intended. And it remains to be seen exactly how responsible their eager new owners will be when they take them out for a spin.
""We know that most aircraft accidents are caused by the user. Hopefully the manufacturers will put into place certain safeguards in the system to limit the ability for a user to put the aircraft in an unsafe operating condition,"" says Darrell Swanson, director of Swanson Aviation Consultancy.
The relatively easy route to market that these very small eVTOLs are taking will get them into people's hands quickly, and allow early adopters to have some fun, says Mr Swanson.
That's all well and good in the near-term, he says. But if these aircraft are to play a role in improving urban mobility for city populations, they will have to carry more passengers, complement public transport, and be more accessible. Otherwise, says Mr Swanson, ""the price will go up and it'll be seen as elitist.""
For now, Mr Ternstrom is happy to market the Jetson ONE purely as a recreational vehicle. It is for having fun, he says. After all, practically everyone has had that thrilling dream where they can fly.
""This thing makes that dream possible,"" he says. ""It's just awesome. I love it.""

271;French elections: Divided left fight doomed race of their own;['2022-01-21T01:19:06.000Z'];['By Hugh Schofield'];['france', 'french elections 2022', 'valérie pécresse', 'emmanuel macron', 'éric zemmour', 'marine le pen'];['moral', 'left', 'interests', 'french', 'popular', 'socalled', 'participation', 'leader', 'stand', 'race', 'fight', 'elections', 'doomed', 'greater', 'divided', 'primary'];"
Pity the French left-winger as he or she contemplates the upcoming presidential elections.
For the first time in living memory, there is not a single candidate from their camp among the front-runners ahead of the April vote.
The highest-ranking leftist, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, is in fifth place at about 9% in the polls, outperformed by a centrist President Emmanuel Macron, a conservative in Valérie Pécresse and two far-right wingers in Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour. 
As things stand, the chances of a left-wing candidate making it through to the second round - let alone winning the election like François Hollande in 2012 and François Mitterrand years before - look like a pipe dream.
What's more, despite the voters' anguished pleas for unity, the party machines have merely responded with yet more division. 
With 11 weeks to go until Round One, the Socialists and the Greens are at daggers drawn over which of their respective candidates, Anne Hidalgo and Yannick Jadot, is the true champion of the mainstream left.    
From his more radical perspective, and from the advantage of a higher poll score, Jean-Luc Mélenchon looks on both with ill-disguised disdain. 
Then there is the Communist, Fabien Roussel, determined to keep his party's identity alive. And he's not doing badly, given that at 3% he is equal with Ms Hidalgo. Add to that anti-capitalists Nathalie Arthaud and Philippe Poutou, fighting their own battle on the fringe. 
One left-wing candidate, ex-minister Arnaud Montebourg, has decided to call it a day, arguing that to continue in the race with such a multitude of candidates would be to ""add disorder to confusion"". 
But that was more than offset by the declaration of another former minister, Christiane Taubira. So there are still seven left-wingers in the running.   
Moreover her late entry into the race merely sowed more ill-feeling where there was already plenty to go round. 
Hailed by many, especially the young, as an inspirational figure because of her battles against racism  and for gay marriage, Ms Taubira was hoping to play a ""deus ex machina"" kind of role, uniting the discordant tribes behind her. 
April 10 Round One: If one candidate wins 50% of vote they win outright
April 24 Round Two: The two front-runners go into a run-off to decide the presidency
Working in Christiane Taubira's favour has been a grassroots project called the ""Popular Primary"", in which at the end of next week left-wing supporters who register on a website will get to choose which candidate best expresses their vision and should therefore represent the left in April. 
With enough participation in the so-called primary, the argument goes, whoever emerges as the most popular leader on the left will have the moral authority to demand that the others all stand aside, which they will of course do in the interests of the greater good.
It may sound plausible. In reality the project is doomed.
Mr Mélenchon and Yannick Jadot have both said they want nothing to do with the business, believing it was conceived by supporters of Christiane Taubira to boost her entry into the race.  
Anne Hidalgo feels the same, but her position is complicated because some in her Socialist Party may actually be rooting for Ms Taubira because they think Ms Hidalgo has made such a lousy campaign of it so far. 
Add to the picture that in this popular primary there are also three other potential candidates - the totally unknown Anna Agueb-Porterie, Charlotte Marchandise and Pierre Larroutourou - and you can see why the average left-wing voter might be tempted to start tugging the rug. 
""There are simply too many heads on too small a stage,"" as Libération newspaper, house journal of the French left, put it this week. ""True, no-one really believed in a grand union of the left. But who would have thought the fingers on one hand would be insufficient to count the candidates?""
Of course in the French system having a multiplicity of candidates on the left or right is not necessarily a handicap. 
That's as long as there is a clear front-runner who, having qualified for the run-off, can count on the first-round votes of their erstwhile rivals, who would now be ministerial hopefuls. 
When Mitterrand won the presidency in 1981, he was up against five left-wing and environmentalist candidates in Round One. However, his first-round vote was 25% and his nearest rival was the Communist, Georges Marchais, on 9%, the same as the highest-ranking leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon is polling today. 
In late-night sessions in Paris salons the arguments roll on about why things have come to this pass:
Or is it simply that Emmanuel Macron craftily mastered this all along, splitting the left apart in 2017? The one thing it has not spent the last five years doing is getting back together.

272;Tonga: Zero-Covid island nation fears aid could bring in virus;['2022-01-20T12:36:34.000Z'];['BBC News'];['coronavirus vaccines', 'tonga volcano and tsunami', 'humanitarian aid'];['water', 'measures', 'island', 'quarantine', 'safe', 'tonga', 'zerocovid', 'nation', 'bring', 'need', 'fears', 'specialists', 'sort', 'virus', 'wash', 'sanitation', 'reconstruction', 'aid'];"
Humanitarian efforts to bring aid to Tonga following Saturday's volcanic eruption and tsunami are being complicated by the need to protect the country from coronavirus. 
The South Pacific island nation is effectively Covid-free, with just one case of infection reported, last October, and the government is determined to keep it that way.
So the authorities have stressed the need for aid to be delivered in a contactless way to avoid bringing in the virus. 
""In Tonga, emergency provisions are being sent in but personnel are not and strict Covid protocols are followed on delivery,"" Aaron Davy, of the Council for International Development, in New Zealand, says.
""Even when working on the broken communication cable out at sea, the work is being done without personal contact with local people.""
Aid agencies also provide assistance remotely - such as coordination expertise - but local authorities and community groups run the response on the ground.
""We have staff and partners in country and we can plan with them and support them without entering Tonga,"" Unicef's resident coordinator for the Pacific Islands, Jonathan Veitch, says.
""We helped vaccinate the entire country, so [contactless delivery] is feasible. 
""But eventually we may need some specialists in Wash (water, sanitation and hygiene) or reconstruction to go in - and then we will need to sort out safe quarantine measures with the government.""
Yes, there have been a number of non-contact operations in the region during the pandemic. 
New Zealand delivered vaccines to Pacific Island nations by naval ship, then on helicopters or inflatable boats, before handing them over to teams on land at a distance. 
Strict safety protocols - such as the wearing of protective clothing - avoided any possible transmission. 
Crew members also received special training on how to handle the vaccine boxes when transferring them. 
Contactless methods were also used to distribute relief supplies to Vanuatu, in the aftermath of Cyclone Harold, in April 2020.
Foreign aid workers were banned from entering the country and aircraft flew in humanitarian supplies that had been disinfected and quarantined for three days. 
""Covid has forced a change in the way aid is delivered and this more localised approach is effective,"" Mr Davy says.
""Not only did we avoid Covid transmission [in Vanuatu] but we were able to support them by getting resources and funds directly to the people in-country who knew how best to respond.""
Tonga has effectively closed its borders to international travel. 
All commercial flights to Tonga are suspended and options to leave are also strictly limited.
Only Tongan citizens and permanent residents, and travellers approved by the health ministry can enter, on occasional repatriation flights, and then must be quarantined for 21 days on arrival. 
Goods coming into the country also have to be quarantined.  
About 60% of Tonga's 105,000 population have been fully vaccinated.
And it has maintained strict internal restrictions since the start of the pandemic, including night-time curfews and restrictions on gatherings.
Tonga is made up of more than 170 islands and its economy relies heavily on foreign tourism. 
The remoteness of some of these island communities, many with limited healthcare resources, makes them particularly vulnerable to an outbreak.  
People also worry the lack of exposure to the virus means little immunity within the population. 
Historical experience also plays a role.  
When Spanish flu reached Tonga, a century ago, with the arrival of a ship carrying sick passengers, the infection spread rapidly. 
It is estimated up to 8% of the population died as a result.
During the 18th Century, other diseases, such measles and dysentery, were also brought in by outsiders, destabilising the small island society.

274;False banana: Is Ethiopia's enset 'wondercrop' for climate change?;['2022-01-21T06:47:45.000Z'];['By Helen Briggs'];['plants', 'agriculture', 'climate change', 'environment', 'food', 'ethiopia'];['enset', 'submit', 'wondercrop', 'change', 'climate', 'banana', 'version', 'question', 'mobile', 'reading', 'visit', 'website', 'need', 'submission', 'ethiopias', 'page', 'false'];"
Scientists say the plant enset, an Ethiopian staple, could be a new superfood and a lifesaver in the face of climate change.
The banana-like crop has the potential to feed more than 100 million people in a warming world, according to a new study.
The plant is almost unknown outside of Ethiopia, where it is used to make porridge and bread.
Research suggests the crop can be grown over a much larger range in Africa.
""This is a crop that can play a really important role in addressing food security and sustainable development,"" said Dr Wendawek Abebe of Hawassa University in Awasa, Ethiopia.
Enset or ""false banana"" is a close relative of the banana, but is consumed only in one part of Ethiopia.
The banana-like fruit of the plant is inedible, but the starchy stems and roots can be fermented and used to make porridge and bread.
Enset is a staple in Ethiopia, where around 20 million people rely on it for food, but elsewhere it has not been cultivated, although wild relatives - which are not considered edible - grow as far south as South Africa, suggesting the plant can tolerate a much wider range.
Using agricultural surveys and modelling work, scientists predicted the potential range of enset over the next four decades. They found the crop could potentially feed more than 100 million people and boost food security in Ethiopia and other African countries, including Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda.
Study researcher Dr James Borrell, of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said planting enset as a buffer crop for lean times could help boost food security.
""It's got some really unusual traits that make it absolutely unique as a crop,"" he said. ""You plant it at any time, you harvest it at any time and it's perennial. That's why they call it the tree against hunger.""
Ethiopia is a major centre of crop domestication in Africa, home to coffee and many other crops.
Climate change is predicted to seriously affect yields and distribution of staple food crops across Africa and beyond.
There is growing interest in seeking new plants to feed the world, given our reliance on a few staple crops. Nearly half of all the calories we eat come from three species - rice, wheat and maize.
""We need to diversify the plants we use globally as a species because all our eggs are in a very small basket at the moment,"" said Dr Borrell.
The research is published in Environmental Research Letters.

At 02:00 local time (07:00 GMT) officers were called to an apartment block in Clairmont Road, Buford Highway, Georgia. 
Dr Matthew Willson, 31, from Surrey, UK, was found in bed with a single gunshot wound to the head.
The Foreign Office said it was ""supporting the family of a British man following his death"". 
Brookhaven Police said the shooting of Dr Willson, from Chertsey, on 16 January was ""random"" and involved the ""reckless discharge of firearms"". 
Dr Willson ""was in town from England visiting loved ones when the incident occurred,"" police said.
Officers had earlier been called to a neighbouring block of flats after reports of gunshots. They received a second call regarding a ""person being shot"" while they were checking the area. 
No suspects have so far been arrested and police are seeking information from the public. Authorities are offering a cash reward for tips that lead to an arrest. 
Sgt Jake Kissel from Brookhaven Police described the location of the shooting as ""a generally safe area"". 
Sgt Kissel told BBC Radio Surrey that officers ""immediately responded to the priority call of someone being shot and that's where they met with a female caller who was rendering aid to her boyfriend who had been shot dead"".
He said: ""We are asking for our public's help in assisting us with this investigation. 
""Our investigators are currently following up on all leads to include potential video, eyewitness accounts as well as the evidence that was left on scene.""

277;Afghan women taken from their homes after speaking out;['2022-01-21T20:50:18.000Z'];['By Quentin Sommerville'];"['kabul', 'afghanistan', ""women's rights in afghanistan"", ""women's rights"", 'taliban']";['detained', 'order', 'seek', 'scenes', 'taliban', 'speaking', 'taken', 'talibans', 'shooting', 'suhai', 'women', 'say', 'shaheen', 'homes', 'afghan'];"
The Taliban can threaten with a whisper. After 20 years of violent struggle, and the loss of tens of thousands of civilian lives, they took power here using brutal force. 
Even so, Afghan women refuse to be intimidated. 
Tamana Zaryabi Paryani is one of those women. It takes raw courage to stand up to armed men who want to take away almost everything you have achieved in life. 
Last weekend, she joined dozens of others to demand the right to work and the right to an education. The protesters were pepper-sprayed by Taliban fighters, and a number said they had been stunned by electric shocks. 
After making their voices heard, they returned home. Some feared they had been followed. 
On Wednesday night, at 20:00, armed men entered Tamana Paryani's apartment block in Kabul's Parwan 2 neighbourhood. She was alone at home with her sisters. The men began to kick the door. 
""Please help, the Taliban have come to my house, my sisters are at home,"" Ms Paryani pleaded on a video posted to social media. 
""We don't want you here now,"" she screamed. ""Come back tomorrow, we can speak tomorrow,"" she pleaded. 
""You can't see these girls at this time of night. Help, the Taliban have come to my house,"" she said before the video ended.
Since the Taliban took power on 15 August, women have complained that they are now prisoners in their own homes. 
And even there they are not safe. It is a violation of Afghan culture to enter a home that contains only women. 
But having dismissed women police officers, the Taliban do not have female personnel available to question women. 
Tamana Paryani has been missing for two days now. I went to her apartment to try and trace her. 
There was no-one inside the home. A large muddy boot-print was still visible on the front door. 
Neighbours said Ms Paryani had been taken away along with two of her sisters, and no-one has been to the apartment since. They would say only that ""an armed group"" had taken the sisters.
Other women protesters were targeted that night. Another, Parawana Ibrahimkhel, is also missing. Still, the Taliban denied taking them. 
In an interview with the BBC on Thursday, Suhai Shaheen, who hopes to become the Taliban's ambassador to the UN, said: ""If [the Taliban] had detained them, they would say they have detained them, and if that is the allegation they will go to court and they will defend themselves... This is something legal, but if they are not detained, and they are making such fake scenes and shooting films in order to seek asylum abroad.""
This video can not be played
One of Miss Paryani's friends told a different story.
From a safe location, in an interview with the BBC, she said, ""I told her as soon as possible, leave your home, take this more seriously you are in danger… When I got home, a friend, also a protester - I don't want to mention her name - she was crying that Tamana had been arrested by the Taliban and that she had released a video on social media.""
It is not known if the authorities are looking for the women. 
Most of the world refuses to recognise the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan. More than half the population is going hungry because of Western-imposed sanctions. 
Under Taliban rule Afghanistan has become the only country in the world which publicly limits education on the basis of gender, which is a major sticking point in the Taliban's quest for legitimacy, and in the lifting of sanctions. The regular protests by women highlighting the issue are a source of embarrassment to the group. 
Regardless of who has Tamara Paryani, her sisters and her friends, the Taliban are collectively punishing Afghan women. 
Over the past 20 years women here have cast off cultural and family prejudice to live more freely -  decades of progress the Taliban appear determined to destroy.

278;Tonga volcano: Plume reached half-way to space;['2022-01-21T16:15:56.000Z'];['Jonathan Amos'];['earth science', 'volcanoes', 'tonga volcano and tsunami', 'geology', 'tonga', 'climate change', 'space exploration'];['little', 'volcano', 'space', 'halfway', 'water', 'reached', 'steam', 'seawater', 'degrees', 'particles', 'tonga', 'magma', 'volume', 'times', 'supercharge', 'plume'];"
An indicator of the great power of last Saturday's volcanic eruption in Tonga is the height reached by its plume.
UK scientists examining weather satellite data calculate it to be around 55km (35 miles) above the Earth's surface.
This is at the boundary of the stratosphere and mesosphere layers in the atmosphere.
Dr Simon Proud, from RAL Space, said these were ""unheard-of altitudes"" for a volcanic plume.
The most powerful eruption in the second half of the 20th Century came from Mount Pinatubo in 1991. Its plume is thought to have climbed to roughly 40km.
However, it's possible today's more accurate satellites would have given a higher altitude for the Philippines event, cautioned Dr Proud, who is affiliated to the UK National Centre for Earth Observation.
To work out the position in the sky of the plume from Tonga's Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai volcano, data from three weather satellites - Himawari-8 (Japan) GOES-17 (USA) and GK2A (Korean) - was used.
""Because they're all at different longitudes, we can use the parallax between their views of the eruption to determine altitude. This is a pretty well established technique for storm cloud heights, and should actually work better here as the altitude [and hence parallax] is greater,"" Dr Proud told BBC News.
Only a small part of the cloud is seen to get to 55km. This is most likely water vapour, rather than ash, that was pushed upward at the head of the updraft. The main umbrella of the plume is at 35km. A lower plume feature is evident in the lowest layer of the atmosphere - the troposphere.
The so-called Kármán line, which is often quoted as the atmospheric boundary with outer space, is at 100km.
US space agency scientists calculated the explosive force to be equivalent to 10 megatons of TNT, which would have made the Tonga event 500 times as powerful as the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, at the end of World War Two. 
Prof Shane Cronin, from Auckland University, New Zealand, believes a special set of conditions came together at the underwater volcano to drive a big explosion.
A key factor, he said, was the depth below the ocean surface at which gas-rich magma came into contact with seawater - at just 150-250m.
""When the magma came out, there was not much pressure on it [from the water above],"" he told the BBC's Science In Action programme on World Service Radio.
""The gases expanded and blasted the magma apart. And then, as those little fragments of hot magma at 1,100 degrees encountered the cold seawater at 20 degrees, it flashed the seawater around those particles into steam. And when you do that, when you flash water into steam, you basically expand the volume by 70 times. So you supercharge your eruption.""  
Early data suggests the Tonga event could have measured as high as five on the volcanic explosivity index (VEI). This would certainly make it the most powerful eruption since Pinatubo, which was classified at six on the eight-point scale.
The Philippines volcano famously dropped Earth's average global temperature by half a degree for a couple of years. It did this by injecting 15 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere. SO2 combines with water to make a haze of tiny droplets, or aerosols, that reflect incoming solar radiation. 
However, Dr Richard Betts, the head of climate impacts at the UK Met Office, said Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai would not have the same effect.
""Pinatubo did have a noticeable effect, but the Hunga-Tonga volcano's emissions were more than 30 times smaller at less than half a million tonnes of sulphur dioxide, so we don't expect that to have a cooling effect, even though it made a huge bang when it went off,"" he explained.

279;US comic Louie Anderson dies aged 68;['2022-01-21T17:28:45.000Z'];['BBC News'];['comedy'];['humor', 'world', 'living', 'aged', 'anderson', 'good', 'comic', 'spirit', 'lucky', 'dies', '68', 'louie', 'gold', 'spreading', 'moment'];"
US comedian Louie Anderson, whose film appearances included Coming to America and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, has died following complications from cancer.
His representatives said in a statement that he ""passed away peacefully"" on 21 January in Las Vegas, aged 68.
The comic won an Emmy in 2016 for his role as Christine Baskets in comedy drama Baskets, plus two nominations for outstanding supporting actor. 
He also co-created and starred in the cartoon sitcom Life With Louie. 
Anderson based the show on his childhood, and also hosted popular US game show Family Feud for a number of years.
As well as having a role in 1988 romantic comedy film Coming to America, starring Eddie Murphy, the comic also appeared in its sequel last year.  
He starred alongside Zach Galifianakis and Martha Kelly in FX show Baskets, and guest-starred on Big Bang Theory spin-off Young Sheldon, as well as playing a recurring character in the TBS dark comedy Search Party.
The comic was also a best-selling author, and his books included Dear Dad, which explored his relationship with his alcoholic father, and Goodbye Jumbo...Hello Cruel World, in which he wrote about his struggle with food addiction and self-esteem.
He paid tribute to the enduring influence of his late mother in his 2018 book Hey Mom.
Actor and writer Henry Winkler said: ""Your generosity of spirit will cover the world from above.""
The comic, who was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, started his career on the US club circuit.
He got his break-out moment in 1984 when he performed a set on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, according to Variety.
Anderson went on to have a four-decade stand-up career, including a comedy special on Showtime in 1987, plus regular TV appearances on late-night shows.
The comedian, who had been receiving treatment for DLBCL (diffuse large B cell lymphoma), is survived by his two sisters, Lisa and Shanna Anderson.

281;Yemen rebel attack on UAE throws challenge to the region;['2022-01-22T01:01:30.000Z'];['By Jonathan Marcus'];['yemen', 'united arab emirates', 'yemen crisis'];['rebel', 'challenge', 'used', 'unclear', 'victim', 'uae', 'tehran', 'throws', 'attack', 'uaeiran', 'weaponry', 'viewed', 'yemen', 'remains', 'region', 'houthis'];"
A sharp escalation in the conflict in Yemen this week has raised questions about the direction the war is taking and what it means for the wider region.
Saudi air strikes against rebel Houthi targets in Yemen have been deadly - aid agencies say one attack alone killed dozens of people when a detention centre in the Houthi stronghold of Saada was targeted.
The strikes are being seen as a response to Monday's rare missile and drone attacks by the Houthis on the UAE, which is a Saudi ally and member of the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis.  
If there were doubts as to whether that attack would lead to a direct response, the Saudis' actions provide the strong hint of an answer. 
Even before the latest Saudi action, the long-range strikes on the UAE placed a spotlight on wider developments in the region, notably the UAE's efforts to pursue a new diplomatic path, not least towards Iran; and the reaction to those attacks illustrates the growing rapprochement between Gulf states and Israel. 
The strikes on 17 January hit an industrial location just outside Abu Dhabi, setting fire to fuel trucks and killing three foreign workers. They also struck an area near the international airport. While the Houthis say that they have attacked the UAE in the past, this is the first time that the UAE authorities have acknowledged such strikes - and the first time that people have been killed. 
The Houthis' aim is to persuade the UAE to stop backing militias loyal to Yemen's internationally-recognised government. These militias, notably the Amaleqa Brigades and associated groups, have had some recent success on the battlefield in Yemen, pushing the Houthis out of key areas of the south of the country and stepping up fighting in the oil-rich Marib governorate in the north, a major stronghold for the Yemeni government. 
Much depends upon how the UAE responds. 
The UAE had been a strong supporter of the Yemeni government, deploying its own troops to the country alongside forces from Saudi Arabia. The Saudis formed a coalition of Arab states and launched a military campaign in 2015 to restore the government driven out by the Houthis.
The UAE withdrew its troops in 2019 but has since continued to arm and train local militias opposed to the Houthis. This was all seen as not just a struggle for control in Yemen but as part of a wider proxy war in the region between the Saudis and their allies on one side, and Iran and various groups that Tehran supports on the other. 
Yemen was just one battleground. Indeed, after the Abraham Accords signed between Israel and the UAE in August 2020 (subsequently joined by Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan), Israel effectively became a public part of this informal anti-Iran coalition. This simply confirmed a trend that has been under way, behind the scenes, for some years.  
So how will the UAE now react? Stability is crucial to the state's self-image. It does not want to be seen as a place that suffers even sporadic attacks. It has maintained its stake in the Yemen fighting despite drawing back its own forces. One obvious response might be to step up support for its allies on the ground.
But equally, in the past few years, the UAE has been trying to push through a complex re-alignment in its foreign policy: there have been the formal ties with Israel; an effort to improve its frosty relationship with Qatar; a warming towards Turkey (another country undergoing something of a diplomatic re-adjustment); and above all it has sought to reach out to establish better relations with Tehran. 
So will the UAE-Iran rapprochement be a victim of the Houthi attack? While Iran remains a clear ally of the Houthis (and much of the weaponry used in these recent attacks may well be of Iranian origin), the fact remains that this is not a simple client-proxy relationship. The Houthis make their own strategic decisions and it is unclear the extent to which this attack will be viewed positively in Tehran. 
For the UAE's allies the attacks also present dilemmas and opportunities. The United States has stressed its ""unwavering"" support for the UAE's security, though the Biden administration is not happy with the UAE and Saudi role in stoking the fighting in Yemen. Might the UAE seek US anti-missile defences? If so, how would the Biden administration respond? 
A more likely source of practical assistance might be Israel. Its Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who visited Abu Dhabi in mid-December, has told the UAE Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed that Israel stands ready to offer security and intelligence support. 
There have been consistent reports of UAE interest, for example, in Israeli anti-missile defence systems like Iron Dome, though it is far from clear that Israel would be willing to sell such sensitive technology at this stage. But other support could be forthcoming. 
Israel may be as interested as the UAE in discovering more about the Houthis' long-range attack capabilities. 
It is another reminder that as the US struggles to pivot its military effort towards the strategic threat from China, its allies in the Middle East are starting to construct their own security relationships in the face of common threats.

282;‘Hi, thanks for calling. Are you OK? How far away are you?’;['2022-01-22T00:56:25.000Z'];['By Sarah McDermott'];['edinburgh', 'sarah everard murder', 'sabina nessa murder'];['deny', 'calling', 'denying', 'listening', 'away', 'streets', 'happen', 'ok', 'hi', 'things', 'thanks', 'say', 'really', 'issue', 'dont', 'far'];"
Women's safety is once again in the spotlight - and walking home at night is often when their fears are most acute. Now a telephone helpline called Strut Safe, launched in Edinburgh last year, is keeping people company when they walk home alone. 
Alice Jackson still remembers the night she answered that call.
""When you pick up the phone you can always tell if the person is scared,"" she says. ""It's the way their voice shakes or catches."" 
The caller told Alice that she was on her way home. 
""She was so sure that something was going to happen, she was preparing herself, she was running. 
 ""She said, 'I think someone is following me.'""
The girl gave Alice her name, her age, her birthday, her address, and a full description of what she looked like and every item of clothing that she was wearing. 
 ""She was like, 'That's what you're going to need,'"" Alice says.
 ""I can still remember exactly what she said she was wearing.""
Alice, 22, and her friend Rachel Chung came up with the idea of a telephone helpline that people can call if they're walking home alone at night in April 2021. 
It wasn't long after they had attended a vigil for Sarah Everard.
""We were devastated and angry,"" Alice says, ""so we bought a cheap burner phone, asked people to volunteer to answer it, and posted the number in community groups."" 
Strut Safe has been taking calls every weekend since. 
""They might have left their friends back at the club, their boyfriend isn't picking up, or it's just too late to call their mum,"" Alice says, ""so people can stay on the phone with one of our volunteers while they're walking home."" 
The Strut Safe volunteers who answer calls are each interviewed, trained and background-checked. They're there to chat and to provide reassurance, but sometimes callers are distressed and worried for their own safety.
""They're in tears, really upset, and you're coaching them through it,"" Alice says. 
""You'll say, 'Look, I'm here with you.'""
And volunteers like Alice are ready to alert the police or call an ambulance if needs be.  
""But we'll always ask, 'Are you happy for us to use this information to help you if something goes wrong?'"" she says.
Initially people heard about Strut Safe through word of mouth, now most people find and share their number on social media. And the volume of calls they receive each weekend varies, Alice says.
There was a massive spike after the death of Sabina Nessa in September last year, she says, and following the murder of Ashling Murphy last week she anticipates that they will see another increase in calls.
""When these things happen people feel more unsafe,"" she says.
Answering the phones for Strut Safe has really opened Alice's eyes to the extent of street harassment and violence, she says.
""People who deny that this is an issue, who say that people make this up for attention, that these things don't really happen, or that the streets aren't like this - listening in on these calls, there is no denying it.""
Funded by donations, Strut Safe operates on a shoestring, and Alice acknowledges it's not a solution.
""To people who say Strut Safe is just a sticking plaster, we understand that - we can't solve the issues,"" she says. 
""But something exists now that didn't exist before, we are here for anyone who needs us and more change will hopefully come.""
Every time a caller gets home safe it's a relief, Alice says.
""They'll say, 'I can see my house now,' or, 'I'm only a minute away,' but I always say, 'Don't worry, it's OK, I'll stay on the phone. 
""Just let me know when you're in the door.'""
She'll hear the clatter of keys, someone's mum calling, ""Where have you been?"" or a dog bark.
And then the words, ""That's me here now, thank you so much"". 
""Sometimes you come off a 20-minute call that's been really emotionally intense, really serious. The caller might have been running at the end, crying. And then you'll hang up, and you're sitting on your sofa, the telly paused, and there'll be silence,"" Alice says. 
And then the phone will ring again. 
""Hi, I'm just on the way home from my work night out. I just wanted to call someone and my friend gave me this number.""
""And you just find your flow again,"" she says.
""Hi, thank you for calling. Are you alright? How far away are you?""
Strut Safe's free helpline 0333 335 0026 operates from 7pm-3am on Fridays and Saturdays, and 7pm-1am on Sundays

283;Beijing Winter Olympics: Why are they controversial?;['2022-01-20T11:58:27.000Z'];['BBC News'];['china', 'beijing', 'uighurs'];['winter', 'china', 'diplomatic', 'place', 'chinas', 'rights', 'beijing', 'controversial', 'games', 'human', 'source', 'olympics'];"
The Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics are due to take place in February. 
However, China's human rights record has prompted a number of countries to declare diplomatic boycotts of the Games, which means their top officials won't attend. 
The Winter Olympics take place from 4 February to 20 February with around 3,000 athletes competing in 109 different events.
The Winter Paralympics run from 4 March to 13 March, with 736 competitors across 78 events.
Some Olympic events, such as curling, will begin a few days before the opening ceremony on 4 February.
China's government and businesses are spending $3.9bn (£2.95bn) on the Games, which are taking place in and around Beijing:
The organisers will spray about 1.2 million cubic metres of artificial snow onto competition sites because so little falls in the region. China has been criticised over the environmental impact of this process. 
Because of Covid, competitors and officials will be kept in secure ""bubbles"" and no spectator tickets will be sold to the public.
The US, UK and Canada have declared a diplomatic boycott of the Games, along with Australia, Lithuania and Kosovo.
Although they will all send athletes to compete, no ministers or officials will attend.
The US said this was because of China's ""human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang"" against the province's Muslim population.
British MP Iain Duncan Smith, who represents the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said: ""The Chinese government commits industrial-scale human rights abuses in the Uyghur Region, Tibet and sends near-daily military incursions into Taiwan's airspace. 
""We cannot lend any legitimacy to China's despotic regime.""
Japan has also said it won't send any ministers to the Games. Although it has stopped short of declaring a ""diplomatic boycott"", the move is still likely to heighten tensions between the two neighbours.
The EU is trying to agree a common diplomatic stance.
France is against a boycott, with President Macron saying: ""I don't think we should politicise these topics, especially if it is to take steps that are insignificant and symbolic."" 
There have also been protests across the world against the Beijing Games by human rights activists.
The Beijing government is accused of committing atrocities against the Uyghur Muslim population in the northwest province of Xinjiang. 
Human rights groups believe more than one million Uyghurs have been detained over the past few years in a large network of what the state calls ""re-education camps"", with hundreds of thousands sentenced to prison terms.
There is also evidence that Uyghurs are being used as forced labour, and that women are being forcibly sterilised. Some former camp detainees allege they were tortured and sexually abused.
Beijing is also accused of restricting the freedom of people in Hong Kong through new legislation including the Hong Kong National Security Law.
In its 2021 annual report, Human Rights Watch said that ""Beijing's repression - insisting on political loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party - deepened across the country"".
German government ministers boycotting the Games said they were protesting against the treatment of Chinese tennis champion Peng Shuai. 
She was not heard from for nearly three weeks after she made allegations of sexual assault against Zhang Gaoli, former vice-premier of China, and a high-ranking communist party member.
Ms Peng said they had a romantic relationship, and that he had ""forced"" her to have sexual relations with him.
It is the first time such an allegation has been made against one of China's senior political leaders.
China's government denies all the allegations made in the case of Ms Peng. 
The country has also consistently denied violating human rights in Xinjiang, and has warned its most vocal accusers - such as the US and Germany - not to interfere in its ""internal affairs"" in Hong Kong.
It has spoken out most loudly against the US diplomatic boycott. 
China's Foreign Ministry said that the US had ""clearly violated the Olympic spirit"", and ""will pay a price for its erroneous actions"". However, it has not specified what this price might be.

284;Yemen crisis: Why is there a war?;['2021-11-02T12:03:24.000Z'];['BBC News'];['yemen', 'ali abdullah saleh', 'yemen crisis'];['cases', 'thought', 'limited', 'treatment', 'seeking', 'report', 'registered', 'testing', 'war', 'crisis', 'deaths', 'yemen', 'houthis'];"
Yemen, one of the Arab world's poorest countries, has been devastated by a civil war. Here we explain what is fuelling the fighting, and who is involved.
The conflict has its roots in the failure of a political process supposed to bring stability to Yemen following an uprising in 2011 that forced its long-time authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.
As president, Mr Hadi struggled to deal with a variety of problems, including attacks by jihadists, a separatist movement in the south, the continuing loyalty of security personnel to Saleh, as well as corruption, unemployment and food insecurity. 
The Houthi movement - known formally as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God) - took advantage of the new president's weakness. 
The Houthis, who champion Yemen's Zaidi Shia Muslim minority and fought a series of rebellions against Saleh during the previous decade, seized control of their northern heartland of Saada province in early 2014 and then began advancing southwards.
Disillusioned with the transition, many ordinary Yemenis - including Sunnis - supported them, and in late 2014 and early 2015 the rebels gradually took over the capital, Sanaa.
The Houthis and security forces loyal to Saleh - who was thought to have backed his one-time enemies in a bid to regain power - then attempted to take control of the entire country, forcing Mr Hadi to flee abroad in March 2015.
Alarmed by the rise of a group they believed to be backed militarily by regional Shia power and rival Iran, Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states began an air campaign aimed at defeating the Houthis, ending Iranian influence in Yemen and restoring Mr Hadi's government.
The coalition received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France.

At the start of the war Saudi officials forecast that it would last only a few weeks. But six years of military stalemate have followed. 
Coalition ground troops helped drive the Houthis and their allies out of much of the south after landing in the port city of Aden in August 2015. However, the rebels have not been dislodged from Sanaa and much of the north-west.
The Houthis also weathered the collapse of their alliance with Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2017. The former president was killed fleeing Sanaa after he appeared to switch sides.
In 2018, the coalition and its allies - now joined by Saleh loyalists - attempted to break the deadlock by launching a major offensive to capture from the Houthis the Red Sea city of Hudaydah, whose port is the principal lifeline for millions of Yemenis at risk of famine. 
After six months of fierce fighting, the warring parties agreed a ceasefire. The agreement required them to redeploy their forces from Hudaydah, establish a prisoner exchange mechanism, and address the situation in the city of Taiz, which has been besieged by the Houthis since 2015.

While hundreds of prisoners have been released, forces have not been fully redeployed and the siege of Taiz continues, raising fears that the battle for Hudaydah's port could resume at some point and trigger a humanitarian catastrophe.
In 2021, the Houthis went on the offensive in Marib, the government's last stronghold in the north and the capital of an oil-rich province. 
The UN has called for a ceasefire, warning that an all-out battle for the provincial capital could put two million civilians at risk and cause mass displacement.
The Houthis have also stepped up their ballistic missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, often hitting civilian infrastructure. Saudi and US officials have accused Iran of smuggling parts for the sophisticated weapons, as well as conventional arms like rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, into rebel-held Yemen in violation of a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied the allegation.
President Hadi's government has been based for the past six years in the southern port city of Aden, but it has struggled to provide basic services and security and the president himself continues to be based in Saudi Arabia. 
The government's authority there has also been challenged by the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is its ally in the war against the Houthis but wants an independent South Yemen, which existed from 1967 until unification with the north in 1990.
In 2018, STC-aligned forces supported by the United Arab Emirates ousted Saudi-backed Hadi loyalists from Aden and several neighbouring provinces, accusing the president of mismanagement and links to Islamists. The infighting ended when Saudi Arabia intervened in late 2019, months after the UAE announced the withdrawal of its forces from Yemen. 
The Riyadh Agreement offered the STC a role in government in exchange for a withdrawal of its forces from Aden and their integration into the military and security forces. But the deal has not been fully implemented and tensions remain high.
Militants from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the local affiliate of the rival Islamic State group (IS) have also taken advantage of the instability, carrying out deadly attacks and occasionally seizing territory from the government in the south.
As a result of the escalation of hostilities in 2021 the prospects for a nationwide ceasefire and a political solution appear slim. 
However, UN efforts to reboot peace talks were boosted by changes to the US policy towards Yemen announced by President Joe Biden in 2021. He revoked the Trump administration's designation of the Houthis as a terrorist group and ended support for what he called ""offensive operations"" by the Saudi-led coalition.

The UN says the war has resulted in shocking levels of suffering.
In December 2020, it reported that the conflict had caused an estimated 233,000 deaths, including 131,000 from indirect causes such as lack of food, health services and infrastructure. 
Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed or wounded as a direct result of the fighting, including more than 10,000 children. 
The US-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) had recorded more than 147,000 fatalities by the start of November 2021. 
Another monitoring group, the Yemen Data Project, had meanwhile attributed 8,780 civilian deaths to Saudi-led coalition air strikes. 
UN experts say all parties to the conflict may have committed war crimes.

The conflict has also caused what the UN says is the world's worst humanitarian disaster.
Four million people have been forced to flee their homes and more than 20.7 million - 71% of the population - are in need of some form of humanitarian assistance or protection for their survival. 
They include 5 million who the UN says are on the brink of famine, and almost 50,000 who are already experiencing famine-like conditions. 
An estimated 2.3 million children under the age of five are acutely malnourished, including 400,000 who are at risk of dying without treatment, according to the UN.
But with only half of the country's 3,500 medical facilities fully functioning and 20% of districts having no doctors, almost 20 million people lack access to adequate healthcare.
One out of every two people also do not have access to safe water. 
This video can not be played
That left authorities struggling to deal with the largest cholera outbreak ever recorded, which has resulted in 2.5 million suspected cases and about 4,000 related deaths since 2016.
The healthcare system was further strained by the Covid-19 pandemic.
The government had registered 9,800 confirmed cases and 1,880 deaths by the end of October 2021. But the actual figures are thought to be much higher due to limited testing, delays in seeking treatment, and the failure of the Houthis to report cases and deaths in areas under their control since May 2020.
What happens in Yemen can greatly exacerbate regional tensions. It also worries the West because of the threat of attacks - such as from al-Qaeda or IS affiliates - emanating from the country as it becomes more unstable.
The conflict is also seen as part of a regional power struggle between Shia-ruled Iran and Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia.
Gulf Arab states - backers of President Hadi - have accused Iran of bolstering the Houthis financially and militarily, though Iran has denied this.
Yemen is also strategically important because it sits on a strait linking the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden, through which much of the world's oil shipments pass.

285;Carlow body: Inquiry after 'dead man' taken into post office;['2022-01-21T22:52:48.000Z'];['BBC News'];['republic of ireland'];['dead', 'elderly', 'paper', 'fled', 'staff', 'man', 'office', 'taken', 'body', 'shocked', 'scene', 'inquiry', 'carlow', 'dropping', 'went', 'post', 'men'];"
An investigation has begun after claims that the body of a dead man was taken into Irish post office in an attempt to claim his pension.
Reports suggest a deceased pensioner was ""propped up by two men"" as his body was carried into the building in County Carlow, according to the Irish Times.
It said the two men ""dropped"" the body and fled when staff questioned them.
Gardaí (Irish police) are investigating the circumstances surrounding the ""unexplained death of an elderly male"".
A Garda spokesman would not comment on the specifics of the incident which happened at a post office in Carlow town on Friday morning but released a brief statement.
""The services of the Garda Technical Bureau and the Office of the State Pathologist have been requested,"" it said.
""A post mortem will be conducted by the Office of the State Pathologist, the results of which will determine the course of the investigation.""
The Irish Times said it understood that a concerned staff member ""enquired about the wellbeing of the man being propped up"" when the group approached the post office counter.
The two men fled, dropping the body at the scene and when staff went to check on the elderly man they were shocked to discover he was dead, the paper said.
Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that earlier on Friday, a man had called in to the post office on Staplestown Road in Carlow and asked to collect a pension on behalf of an elderly man.
That request was refused as staff told him the pensioner had to be present in order to release the money.
A short time later, two men arrived back with a man aged in his 60s who ""collapsed"" in the post office.
""Detectives are now investigating if the man was already dead when he was brought to the post office,"" RTÉ said.
It reported that a nearby house has been ""sealed off as a crime scene"".

286;Ukraine tension: US 'lethal aid' arrives in Kyiv amid border build-up;['2022-01-22T14:21:29.000Z'];['BBC News'];['russia', 'ukraine conflict', 'ukraine'];['russia', 'buildup', 'ukraine', 'arrives', 'rebels', 'peninsula', 'territory', 'million', 'ukrainian', 'aid', 'tension', 'kyiv', 'lethal', 'russianbacked', 'amid', 'seized', 'peace', 'killed', 'border'];"
Some 90 tonnes of US ""lethal aid"" has arrived in Ukraine, amid tensions over Russia's troop build-up on the border.
It was the first shipment of a recently approved package of US military aid for Ukraine, and included ammunition for ""front-line defenders"".
The delivery followed US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv this week, where he warned of a tough response if Russia was to invade.
Moscow has denied any plans to attack or invade Ukraine.
US President Joe Biden approved the $200m (£147.5m) security support package in December.
The US embassy in Kyiv said the shipment demonstrated its ""firm commitment to Ukraine's sovereign right to self-defense"".
""The United States will continue providing such assistance to support Ukraine's Armed Forces in their ongoing effort to defend Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity against Russian aggression,"" it wrote on Facebook.
Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov thanked the US for the aid.
The shipment arrived hours after Russia's foreign minister and his US counterpart held what they called ""frank"" talks to try to reduce the chance of a wider conflict in Ukraine.
Russia has seized Ukrainian territory before, annexing the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Since then, some 14,000 people have been killed and at least two million fled their homes because of fighting between the Ukrainian army and Russian-backed rebels. A fragile peace agreement was made in 2015.
Now, the head of the military defence alliance Nato has warned there is a real risk of a fresh conflict in Europe after an estimated 100,000 Russian troops amassed on the border.
Moscow has denied it is planning an invasion, but President Vladimir Putin has issued demands to the West which he says concern Russia's security, including that Ukraine be stopped from joining Nato. 
He also wants Nato to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to eastern Europe, seeing this as a direct threat to Russia's security.

288;Sudan protesters: Ready to die for freedom;['2022-01-23T01:19:38.000Z'];['By Mohanad Hashim'];['africa today podcasts'];['power', 'wake', 'turned', 'protests', 'ready', 'streets', 'ousted', 'freedom', 'sudan', 'protesters', 'share', 'reluctance', 'showed', 'die', 'presidents'];"
""Did I just survive a massacre?"" asked a young Sudanese man when he answered my call not long after security forces had opened fire on protesters in downtown Khartoum.
Known by his Twitter name Bashy, he told how one of seven people had died last Monday afternoon in the capital.
""I was filming the protesters and walking when a bullet penetrated his chest; he died in front of me. That could have been me!""
In his mid-twenties, and usually with a smile on his face, Bashy has been protesting on the streets for the past three months.
Like many of his contemporaries, he is furious that the military seized power last  October, just over two years into an agreement between the generals and a civilian coalition to share power.
Life had been improving and the economic crisis easing as civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok brought Sudan in from the cold following sanctions imposed on the country during the long rule of Omar al-Bashir, accused of using the country to sponsor terrorism.
The former president's military allies ousted him in April 2019 in the wake of mass protests, but they then showed their reluctance to share power with those on the streets when they turned their guns on them in a devastating massacre two months later.
The outcry that followed forced the generals to agree to the transition - but as many suspected, the military was never happy with the arrangement, and the latest coup, they say, has proved them right.
Bashy, who has been on the front lines of the recent demonstrations documenting the rallies and marches on his social media feeds, says those on the neighbourhood committees co-ordinating the fightback on the streets are mainly young.
In fact it is estimated that 61% of Sudan's population is under the age of 25 and they are fed up with what Bashy terms ""strong-man rule"". 
It is a generational conflict with the young wanting a more equitable, peaceful, and democratic future.
""We are different to previous generations,"" says Bashy.
""We want to stop the cycle, this vicious cycle of military coups and authoritarianism. That is why we protest - because we wish to see the end of this cycle.""
The protesters feel they have legitimacy on their side - and the junta has indeed been dealt a blow by the resignation earlier this month of Mr Hamdok.
In the aftermath of the coup he was put under house arrest - but then signed a new deal with the generals - something his civilian coalition, the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC), rejected.
He only lasted six weeks before realising he could not work without the political backing of the FFC.
Some of the economic reforms he brought in - applauded by the international community - were painful for everyone, but his attempts to dismantle the old guard's hold on the economy also ruffled feathers.
Indeed, this week, Sudan's military ruler Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan finally appointed a caretaker administration, which includes some of those Bashir loyalists, to steer the country to elections.
Nidal, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, is a seasoned protester - first taking to the streets during the Arab spring when people began to brave the streets.
She believes the military's harsh treatment of the protesters - more than 70 have died so far - is forcing those organising the demonstrations to become more tactical - or more cohesive.
""You can sense the military is doing us a favour - the more of us they kill, helps us the people to come together, reshape our nationalist sentiment and foster a new patriotism for building a new country.""
Since independence the armed forces have monopolised any sense of patriotism.
But their actions - in particular those of the former paramilitary unit, the Rapid Support Forces led by Mohamed Hamdan ""Hemeti"" Dagolo - and their role in the massacre of June 2019 means much of the respect they were once afforded has been lost by young Sudanese.
For Nidal, the demonstrations have had a devastating effect on her family: one of her 18-year-old cousins was shot dead by soldiers in December.
When I spoke to her late one evening this week she had just been to various barricades in Khartoum to round up her many other cousins to check they were all safe.
Yet the situation has just made them all the more determined - because they feel they can really make a difference.
""I am ready to die,"" she told me.
In mid-January, the junta announced that it was setting up a counter-terrorism force to deal with the security challenges posed by the protests - which are also hitting the economy.
Viewing peaceful protesters as terrorists is seen by many as taking a leaf out of the Bashir-era rule book.
In their statements, the authorities note how many policemen are injured on duty during the nationwide protests - with little regard to the death of demonstrators.
This week, the death of a police brigadier general has been blamed on the protesters, but activists dispute this and say it is being used as an excuse to unleash yet more force.
And this week's violence came after an Al Jazeera channel that had been carrying live feeds of the demonstrations and rallies was banned.
The crackdown on media freedoms has become unrelenting: journalists have been beaten and assaulted, media offices attacked and international media barred. 
There has been a flurry of diplomatic activity to break the stalemate, including a  consultation process launched by the UN.
But many Sudanese have little faith in the UN, given it backed the failed November pact entered into by Mr Hamdok.
And the protesters just want the military out of any government as they feel the generals are not to be trusted.
""No negotiations, no partnership, no legitimacy"" is the rallying cry of the current pro-democracy movement.
Against this backdrop, the Friends of Sudan met this week to try and hammer out a solution.
This group includes the US, the UK, European states and junta allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Yet both Bashy and Nidal sound unimpressed by such efforts - and they agree the counter-terror force will not cow them.
""We are world class in peaceful resistance, Monday's massacre will not deter us,"" Bashy said.
""We are not letting them take our blood, sweat and tears and use it for their own gains.""

289;Burkina Faso military bases hit by heavy gunfire;['2022-01-23T11:12:43.000Z'];['BBC News'];['burkina faso'];['power', 'gunfire', 'mali', 'bases', 'heavy', 'killing', 'burkina', 'neighbouring', 'faso', 'hit', 'public', 'raised', 'outrage', 'jihadists', 'suspected', 'military'];"
Heavy gunfire has been heard at several barracks in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou, and at a nearby air base.
The government has denied reports of a coup or that President Roch Kaboré has been detained.
The defence minister said the crisis had been contained, though there was still shooting at some barracks. 
The government has faced growing discontent over its failure to quell an Islamist insurgency that has devastated the West African state since 2015.
On 11 January, it said that 10 soldiers had been arrested over an alleged coup plot.
The government has also repeatedly cut internet services, and has cracked down on public protests against the growing instability. 
Residents said that gunshots could be heard since the early hours of Sunday at military camps in the west and south of the capital, Ouagadougou, and at an air base near the main airport. 
Soldiers convicted of a coup attempt in 2015 are imprisoned at the camp in the west, known as Sangoule Lamizana.
Shooting was also heard at military bases in the northern towns of Kaya and Ouahigouya.
In a televised address to the nation, Defence Minister Barthélémy Simporé played down reports of a mutiny.
He said there were ""localised, limited"" incidents ""in a few barracks"", and none of the ""republican institutions"" had been targeted.
The soldiers involved had not yet made any demands, and the government was still trying to understand their motives, he added. 
Gen Simporé urged people to continue with their normal activities, saying the government would release further information in due course. 
The location of President Kaboré is unclear, but the defence minister denied rumours circulating on social media that he was under arrest. 
Mr Kaboré, a former banker and prime minister, became president after winning elections in 2015.
The polls were the first since long-serving ruler Blaise Compaoré went into exile a year earlier following a popular uprising against his rule.
Mr Kaboré announced a shake-up of the military top brass in November in an attempt to tighten his grip on power, and to fight Islamist insurgents who have wreaked havoc in the entire region. 
The killing of 53 people by suspected jihadists in November heightened public outrage against the government for failing to end the insurgency, and raised fears that the military would take power - just as it had in neighbouring Mali in May.

Some people are prepared to stand for hours in the freezing cold on a winter's night to watch and capture the Northern Lights. Meet the aurora hunters.
Michelle Cumming has been fascinated with the Northern Lights since she saw the phenomenon for the first time in September 2020.
""I've made last minute dashes in my unicorn PJs,"" says the 42-year-old, who lives in Moray on Scotland's north east coast 
""And I've had my backpack and flask prepared to go aurora hunting.
""I often take my dog Dexter with me, wrapping him up in a fleece blanket while we stand and watch the aurora. There have been several 1am excursions.""
Michelle, who works in admin at Moray Council, says her first encounter was during a walk on a beach at Lossiemouth.
""That night blew me away,"" she says. ""Not only did the aurora show but it danced.
""What I remember most vividly from that night is not only my awe at seeing such a sight, it was the chorus of wonder from the spectators in the darkness further down the promenade.""
The aurora is a natural phenomena caused by geomagnetic storms from the Sun. It can appear in the sky as rays of light which shimmer and ""dance"".
Dark autumn and winter nights offer the best chance of seeing displays - if skies are clear - and there are websites, apps and social media groups providing forecasts and alerts for when they might occur.
In the UK, Scotland is one of the best places to see the aurora but powerful displays have also been visible from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Aberdeenshire-based Jacquie Murray also tries to see the aurora whenever possible.
""I first encountered the aurora in 1986 driving a bus from Aberdeen to Peterhead,"" she says.
""I stopped the bus to allow the passengers to see it.""
Jacquie, a health and safety inspector with an energy company, took a keen interest in photography six years ago - mainly to capture images of the aurora.
She says: ""I have at times seen myself standing in the freezing cold in minus temperatures a good four to six hours either waiting or watching.
""You have to be keen and willing to drive to areas where there is little or no light pollution, check for clear skies, be patient - and look north.""
Chris Cogan is among the lucky ones who can see the aurora pretty much from his doorstep, living in the small community of Muie in Sutherland in the Highlands.
The 54-year-old joiner says: ""I sometimes go out for 15 minutes, take a few photos and go back in as the conditions or aurora are not the best. 
""Some nights I will watch the green arc of the aurora form, grow bigger and spread nearer to me and I will wait until she 'lets go' - aurora spotters' term for when it starts dancing and putting up huge beams.
""This can be a few hours waiting.""
Chris says some people may have seen the aurora without realising it.
""To the human eye they're just white light, like fog with stars on the horizon, but a camera or phone pick up the colour,"" he says.
""Some very powerful auroras, the human eye can see the green or orange.""
Alan Tough, an Elgin-based whisky industry chartered engineer, is another keen Northern Lights photographer.
He has been interested in astronomy since he was a boy, and remembers staying up to watch Neil Armstrong take his first steps on the moon.
Alan is a member of the British Astronomical Association and regularly sends reports and photographs to its aurora section. Like some other aurora hunters, he also frequently submits images to BBC Weather Watchers.
He says: ""Despite growing up under the dark skies of Speyside, I didn't see my first aurora until, probably, the late 1990s. 
""I've been seriously photographing the aurora ever since I got my first digital camera back in 2003.""
He has also seen the lights in Canada, Iceland and Norway - and he and his wife were almost shipwrecked while sailing back from the Arctic Circle on a Northern Lights cruise in 2019.
There are always eager new recruits to the band of people prepared to put up with freezing weather to catch a glimpse of the lights' ethereal glow.
Among them is Desiree Ventura, 33, who lives in Aberdeen - a city with a song about the aurora.
""I've been hunting the aurora for a couple of years now,"" says the content creator and amateur photographer, who is originally from Italy.
Last year, she photographed the lights for the first time but the display was only visible as a faint glow on her camera.
Then earlier this month she saw it for the first time with her own eyes from near Newburgh on the Aberdeenshire coast.
""It was such a strong event and the whole display was clearly visible to the naked eye. I was so excited,"" says Desiree.
""The show lasted for over an hour, but it was so spectacular that I didn't even realise I had been standing there for that long.""
Dawid Gierszewski, a 46-year-old window cleaner, has seen the aurora from Aberdeen beach.
He says: ""The aurora is a wonderful sight. It is evidence of how beautifully the world was created.
""Sometimes I stay outside for three to four hours waiting for or watching the aurora.""
The solar activity behind the aurora peaks in cycles of about every 11 years, and Caithness Astronomy Group chairman Gordon Mackie says the next few years could offer more opportunities for seeing it.
The 53-year-old chemist, who lives in Thurso, says: ""With the next peak due in a couple of years time we should see a good number of displays over the next four years. 
""For a few years around solar activity peak, sightings from the north of Scotland are fairly common.
""During the last peak in activity I was seeing the aurora more than 30 times a year.""
And he added: ""A good display is a magical sight likely to be remembered for a very long time. 
""I've seen it fill the entire sky numerous times - you look up in awe, mesmerised by the dancing lights.""

292;Srikanth Bolla: The blind CEO’s £48m company which nearly didn’t happen;['2022-01-24T00:20:28.000Z'];['BBC News'];['disability', 'india'];['struggle', 'ceos', 'opportunities', 'happen', 'realised', 'srikanth', 'nearly', 'fighting', 'point', 'company', 'mentors', 'job', 'life', '48m', 'blind', 'looked', 'picture', 'bolla', 'didnt'];"
Srikanth Bolla is about to have a Bollywood film made about his life. The young CEO has built a company worth £48m - but it nearly didn't happen. As a teenager, Srikanth was told it was illegal for him to study maths and science at senior school because he is blind, so he sued an Indian state to make it possible, as Arundhati Nath explores.
Every day, for two years, six-year-old Srikanth Bolla walked several kilometres to school in rural India, guided by his brother and following his classmates. 
The route was a muddy track, lined with shrubs, which flooded during monsoons. It wasn't a happy time. 
""No one talked to me as I was a blind kid,"" he says. 
Born to poor, illiterate parents, he was rejected by the community. 
""My parents were told that I couldn't even be a watchman for my own house because I couldn't see if a street dog had walked in.
""Many people would come to my parents and ask them to murder me with a pillow,"" the now 31-year-old recount
Ignoring this, his parents were very supportive and, when he turned eight, Srikanth's father said he had some exciting news. Srikanth had been given a place at a boarding school for blind children and would be moving to the nearest city of Hyderabad - 249 miles (400km) away. At the time, the city was in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
Although a long way from his parents, Srikanth was excited and quickly settled in. He learned to swim, play chess and play cricket with a ball that made rattling sounds so he could locate it. ""It is about the hand and the ear,"" he reveals. 
Srikanth enjoyed his hobbies but also started to wonder about his future. He had always dreamed of becoming an engineer and knew he needed to study science and maths for that. 
When the time came, he selected those crucial subjects but his school said ""no"", and informed him it was illegal. 
Indian schools are run by several bodies, each with their own rules. Some come under the state governments or central boards, others are managed privately. 
Srikanth's school was run by the State Board of Education of Andhra Pradesh and, as such, was not permitted to teach science and maths to blind senior students because it was considered too much of a challenge with its visual elements like diagrams and graphs. Instead, they could study the arts, languages, literature and social sciences.
It was 2007 and Srikanth was frustrated by this arbitrary law that wasn't the same for all schools. One of his teachers, Swarnalatha Takkilapati, was frustrated too and encouraged his young student to take action.
The duo went to the Board of Secondary Education in Andhra Pradesh to plead their case, but they were told nothing could be done. 
Undeterred, they found a lawyer and, with the support of the school management team, filed a case with the High Court of Andhra Pradesh appealing for a change to education law to allow blind students to study maths and science. 
""The lawyer fought it on our behalf,"" Srikanth says, the student didn't need to appear in court himself.
While the case rumbled on, Srikanth heard a rumour - a mainstream school in Hyderabad - Chinmaya Vidyalaya which operated under a different education body and offered science and maths to blind students. It had a place for him if he was interested.
Srikanth happily enrolled.
He was the only blind student in his class, but says ""they welcomed me with open arms"".
He says: ""My class teacher was very friendly. She did everything that was possible to help me. She learnt how to draw tactile diagrams.""  
Tactile diagrams can, for instance, be created using thin film on a rubber mat. When a drawing is made on it with a biro or pencil it creates a raised line which you can feel. 
After six months there was news from court - Srikanth had won his case.
The court had ruled blind students could study science and maths in their senior years at all state board schools in Andhra Pradesh. 
""I felt extremely happy,"" Srikanth says. ""I got the first opportunity to prove to the world that I could do it and the younger generation needn't worry about filing cases and fighting through the court,"" he says. 
Srikanth soon returned to a state board school and studied his beloved maths and science, averaging 98% in his exams. 
His plan was to apply to India's prestigious engineering colleges known as the IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology). 
Competition is fierce and students often attend intense coaching ahead of entrance exams - but none of the coaching schools would accept Srikanth.  
""I was told by top coaching institutes that the course load would be like pouring rain on a small sapling,"" he says, explaining they presumed he wouldn't meet the academic standard.
""But I have no regrets. If IIT didn't want me, I didn't want IIT either,"" Srikanth says, settling  
He applied to universities in America instead and received five offers, settling on MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts where he became the first international blind student. He arrived in 2009 and described his early days there as a ""mixed experience"". 
""The extreme cold was the first shock as I wasn't used to such cold weather. The food smelt and tasted different. All that I ate for the first month were French fries and fried chicken fingers.""
But Srikanth soon began to adjust. 
""The time at MIT was the loveliest period of my life. 
""In terms of academic rigour, it was tough and gruesome. Their disability services did great work in supporting, accommodating and bringing me up to speed.""
While he studied he also started a non-profit organisation, Samanvai Center for Children with Multiple Disabilities, to train and educate young disabled people in Hyderabad . He also opened a Braille library there with money he raised. 
Life was going well. He graduated from MIT in management science and was offered several jobs, but he chose not to stay in the states. 
Srikanth's school experience had left a mark, and he felt like he had unfinished business in his native country.
""I had to struggle so much for everything in life whereas not everybody can fight like me or have mentors like me,"" he says, adding that once he looked at the bigger picture he realised there was no point fighting for a fair education if there were no job opportunities for disabled people to take afterwards. 
He thought: ""Why don't I start my own company and employ persons with disabilities?""
Srikanth returned to Hyderabad in 2012 and founded Bollant Industries. The packaging company manufactures eco-friendly products, such as corrugated packaging, from fallen areca palm leaves and is valued at £48m.
It employs as many disabled people and those with mental health conditions as possible. Before the pandemic this accounted for 36% of its 500-strong staff.
Last year, aged 30, Srikanth made it onto the World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders 2021 list and he hopes that within three years his company Bollant Industries will become a Global IPO - where its shares are simultaneously listed on multiple international stock exchanges. 
Bollywood has also come calling. A biopic starring well known actor Rajkummar Rao has been announced and will begin filming in July. Srikanth hopes it will stop people underestimating him when they first meet him.
""Initially people would think, 'oh, he's blind…how sad' but the moment I start explaining who I am and what I do, everything changes.""

293;The people deciding to ditch their smartphones;['2022-01-24T00:27:05.000Z'];['By Suzanne Bearne'];['addiction', 'life', 'mobile phones', 'lifestyle', 'work-life balance'];['park', 'mobile', 'phones', 'deciding', 'smartphones', 'single', 'recalls', 'pivotal', 'scrolling', 'playground', 'parent', 'ditch', 'moments'];"
In a world where many of us are glued to our smartphones, Dulcie Cowling is something of an anomaly - she has ditched hers.
The 36-year-old decided at the end of last year that getting rid of her handset would improve her mental health. So, over Christmas she told her family and friends that she was switching to an old Nokia phone that could only make and receive calls and text messages.
She recalls that one of the pivotal moments that led to her decision was a day at the park with her two boys, aged six and three: ""I was on my mobile at a playground with the kids and I looked up and every single parent - there was up to 20 - were looking at their phones, just scrolling away,"" she says.
""I thought 'when did this happen?'. Everyone is missing out on real life. I don't think you get to your death bed and think you should have spent more time on Twitter, or reading articles online.""
Ms Cowling, who is a creative director at London-based advertising agency Hell Yeah!, adds that the idea to abandon her smartphone had built up during the Covid lockdowns.
""I thought about how much of my life is spent looking at the phone and what else could I do. Being constantly connected to lots of services creates a lot of distractions, and is a lot for the brain to process."" 
She plans to use the time gained from quitting her smartphone to read and sleep more.
About nine out of 10 people in the UK now own a smartphone, a figure broadly replicated across the developed world. And we are glued to them - one recent study found that the average person spends 4.8 hours a day on their handset.
Yet a small, but growing number of people, enough is enough. 
Alex Dunedin binned his smartphone two years ago. ""Culturally we have become addicted to these tools,"" says the educational researcher and technology expert. ""They are blunting cognition and impeding productivity.""
Mr Dunedin, who lives and works in Scotland, says another reason behind his decision was environmental concerns. ""We are wasting exponential amounts of energy producing exponential amounts of CO2 emissions,"" he says.
He has become happier and more productive since he stopped using a smartphone, he says. Mr Dunedin doesn't even have an old-fashioned mobile phone or even a landline anymore. He is instead only electronically contactable via emails to his home computer.
""It has improved my life,"" he says. ""My thoughts are freed up from constantly being cognitively connected to a machine that I need to feed with energy and money. I think that the danger of technologies is that they are emptying our lives.""
Lynne Voyce, a 53-year-old teacher and writer from Birmingham, has moved in the opposite direction - she started using a smartphone again last August after a break of six years.
She says she was reluctantly compelled to buy one again due to having to deal with QR codes in restaurants, and so-called Covid passports, plus making it easier to keep in touch with one of her daughters who lives in Paris.
But she plans to give up it up again, if she can. ""After the pandemic, and when Ella [her eldest daughter] isn't living abroad, I might try and give it up again. It sounds like an addiction, doesn't it?""
When Ms Voyce first abandoned her smartphone back in 2016 it was to help encourage her daughters to reduce the time they spent on their handsets.
""They were glued to their phones. I thought the only way to stop it was to get rid of my own phone. And it made all the difference.
""For example, we'd got to a restaurant, and they would no longer see me pick up my phone.""
Not having a smartphone ""took a lot of pressure off my brain"" she says, ""I didn't feel like I had to instantly answer things or be available when out"".
Yet, while some worry about how much time they spend on their handset, for millions of others they are a godsend.
""More than ever, access to healthcare, education, social services and often to our friends and family is digital, and the smartphone is an essential lifeline for people,"" says a spokesperson for UK mobile network Vodafone.
""We also create resources to help people get the most from their tech, as well as to stay safe when they're online - that's hugely important.""
However, Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist and author of The Phone Addiction Workbook, says there is a strong link between heavy device usage and relationship issues, quality of sleep, our ability to switch off and relax, and concentration levels.
""Many people have a constant drip feed of requests coming their way via their device, many with a false sense of urgency.
""They feel unable to lay boundaries down, with the result that they feel compelled to check their emails and messages last thing at night and first thing in the morning.""
If getting rid of your smartphone seems too much but you are concerned that you spend too much time on it, there are other measures you can take to reduce your usage.
While it might initially seen counterintuitive, more apps are emerging to curtail mindless scrolling.
For example, Freedom lets you temporarily block apps and websites so you can focus more. And Off The Grid enables you to block off your phone for a certain time period.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Ms Burke says it would be useful if more people monitored how much time they spend on their smartphone. ""Starting to realise exactly how much time you're frittering away each day on your phone can be a powerful wake-up call and catalyst for change.""
She also advises carving out short periods when you have your phone switched off or left at home, and gradually increase the wait period till you check it again.
Finally, she recommends choosing an image or a word that represents what you would rather be doing - if only you had more time - as your phone's screensaver.
""Considering most of us check our phones 55 times per day and some of us even 100 times, this is a great visual reminder of a more valuable way to spend your precious time,"" she says.

294;‘His voice became my constant companion’ – how Dan Johnson kept his dad’s memory alive;['2022-01-22T22:05:07.000Z'];['By Dan Johnson'];['the beatles'];['voice', 'memory', 'johnson', 'constant', 'things', 'kept', 'zone', 'dan', 'typical', 'usual', 'willingness', 'wouldnt', 'alive', 'companion', 'talking', 'dads', 'yorkshireman', 'tick', 'thankfully'];"
When BBC correspondent Dan Johnson posted on Twitter shortly before Christmas that he had finished editing a project capturing the voice of his late father Graeme, he was surprised by the reaction. It made him consider the importance of preserving the memories of loved ones. 
Through the dark days of December, my dad was a constant companion. He spoke to me almost every day while I limited my social life to protect my Christmas plans. I couldn't speak to him, though. He'd died four years earlier.
I'd finally got round to editing his own personal version of Desert Island Discs - the long-running BBC radio programme where guests share the soundtrack of their lives - recorded in his last few months. I listened over and over to set the sound levels, carefully piecing together his audio jigsaw - the music that meant the most to him, and the comedians who made him laugh.
He had lung cancer, despite never smoking, and while we knew his life would be shortened, his outlook was positive - he was responding to treatment and focused entirely on living. We never discussed death. His suggestion, that we sit down and cover everything from Dusty Springfield to The Moody Blues, Morecambe and Wise to Eddie Izzard, was the only hint of something to leave behind, apart from a bench overlooking his favourite view across Green Moor cricket ground high on a hill in South Yorkshire.  
It's the sort of talking we didn't do much of. He was a fairly typical Yorkshireman when it came to emotions. Besides that, I wouldn't have felt able to raise the idea for fear of negatively affecting his optimistic outlook, maybe even his chances. But thankfully, he was up for it and signalled a willingness to step outside our usual comfort zone. Even if his intention was to speak only about songs and sketches, I saw a chance to nudge him into reflecting a little on life and the things that made him tick. 
We started recording on a wet and windy night in September 2017, hunkered down in the old station master's house at Ribblehead, by the impressive viaduct in the Yorkshire Dales. We were away for a few days in one of his favourite spots, where he'd stayed decades before as a boy scout on his first night away from family in Hull. Now he'd been drawn back.
He'd already given me a scrawled list of clips to play next to the warming fire as trains passed by the window. I waved a microphone towards him and he explained he thought it would be a nice thing to hand on, something he wished he had from his parents and grandparents. 
As we embarked on the list, he described a fascination with sound, its power and projection, that began as a young boy at the house of a neighbour who had a big radiogram. He captured typical family life at the end of the 1960s, gathered around watching the Morecambe and Wise Christmas special and having to take his turn on the new ""Hi-Fi system"" to play his budding LP collection that started with the Beatles' Abbey Road. The older girls next door had asked if he wanted to see the Beatles with them at Hull's ABC cinema. His parents said 12-year-old Graeme was too young.
I never knew he'd flunked his A-Levels and been forced to take a gap year to weigh up his options. He spent that summer in France, working on a campsite, where the local kids played Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon on the bar's jukebox. 
He went on to build a career in town planning, which took him to Liverpool, Nottingham and Barnsley, where he worked on redeveloping a landscape scarred by coal mines and coke works. He'd drag me and my sister along the redundant railway lines converted to cycle paths or march us up replanted slag heaps to see the new roads and modern warehouses which were replacing the old industries.
In the old station master's house, we talked about Van Morrison being a grumpy old man but a great performer. He remembered Bruce Springsteen's epic live gigs full of energy. He described a secret teenage love of Motown, hidden because it wasn't deemed cool at the time. 
As he relaxed a bit, he confessed some thoughts of ""what if"", but was content things had worked out well. He'd made plans in life but had always been flexible, prepared to take opportunities and confident things would be fine. 
After three recording sessions, we were about two thirds of the way down his playlist when time ran out. I started editing soon after his lungs suddenly deteriorated at the end of 2017. But I found it tough. It was upsetting and I faced a difficult decision. Without a proper ending, I wasn't sure how to wrap up his unfinished symphony. I wonder if I was also reluctant to complete what had become the last task of his life.
True to form, he'd left a list of scribbled suggestions, so eventually I took that, explained his spoken contribution would end there, then let his other choices play through.
There was other stuff that went unsaid. He chose Dear John, sung by Eddi Reader but written by Kirsty MacColl about the end of her marriage. My dad referred to his own divorce, but he didn't say much and I didn't press him. ""It had a resonance, it rang a bell,"" he said. ""It made me think, yes, she's captured that very well.""
These were hints of deeper meaning behind his choices, even the entire project. He was more emotionally engaged than he let on. He'd learned to love music listening to albums in their entirety, through upbeat hits and darker melodies, changing moods and different tones. He took the rough with the smooth and focused on the overarching narrative, aware that development comes in stages and hopeful that it would be alright in the end - whatever happens along the way.
Some of my family were wary of listening to the finished recording. They'd had four years of radio silence and had to brace themselves to hear his voice again. My sister said it wasn't the gut punch that she'd feared it might be. She found it warm and comforting, not distant or upsetting. The familiarity reassured her that she hadn't forgotten him. Van Morrison brought tears because Brown Eyed Girl had been set as his ringtone.
I appreciate we're really fortunate to have this. I know so many others do not, and I'm sorry. I hope photos, videos and stories can help keep memories fresh and flowing. Death has snatched suddenly from so many families, without even the chance to say goodbye. But if you have the opportunity, make the most of it - get something recorded. It doesn't matter what you talk about. The reflections and insights are powerful but really, it's much simpler than that.
I'll never hear my dad as an old man, the tales he would have told his grandsons, the new interests he'd have immersed himself in. But he left me his snorting, sniggering laughter, the traces of his Hull accent still stretching out his words, and his friendly voice preserved in all its rich, gentle warmth.
""I may be old, but at least I got to see all the best bands,"" he said, quoting one of his own statement t-shirts. It's arguable. He'd only just turned 63 and, as he said himself, he never did see the Beatles.

295;No 10 staff gathered indoors for PM birthday in lockdown;['2022-01-24T20:05:14.000Z'];['BBC News'];['keir starmer', 'boris johnson', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['way', 'run', 'making', 'lockdown', 'distraction', 'question', 'better', 'staff', 'indoors', 'staying', 'morning', 'country', 'office', 'birthday', 'gathered'];"
Downing Street has admitted that staff gathered inside No 10 to celebrate Boris Johnson's birthday when the first Covid lockdown was still in place.
ITV News reports up to 30 people attended the June 2020 event, sang Happy Birthday and were served cake.
No 10 said staff had ""gathered briefly"" to ""wish the prime minister a happy birthday"", adding that he had been there ""for less than 10 minutes"". 
Rules at the time banned most indoor gatherings of more than two people.
ITV News said the birthday event had taken place in the Cabinet Room just after 2pm on 19 June 2020, adding that it had been a surprise for Mr Johnson after he returned from an official trip to a school in Hertfordshire.
It also reported that family and friends had been hosted in the prime minister's residence that evening.
But a No 10 spokesperson said: ""This is totally untrue. In line with the rules at the time the prime minister hosted a small number of family members outside that evening.""
And a source also told the BBC this second gathering had involved a barbecue in the No 10 garden with members of Mr Johnson's family.
Under the Covid restrictions in place at the time, up to six people could gather outside, in a socially distanced manner.
But gatherings inside of two or more people were still not permitted indoors, except for certain reasons such as work or education.
A source told the BBC that the prime minister's then fiancée, Carrie Symonds, had organised the cake served in the Cabinet Room and arrived at the event with Lulu Lytle, the interior designer who carried out a revamp of the couple's Downing Street flat.
They also said some sandwiches and picnic food had been arranged and that there was no discussion about social distancing, with up to 30 people in attendance.
A No 10 spokesperson said: ""A group of staff working in No 10 that day gathered briefly in the Cabinet Room after a meeting to wish the prime minister a happy birthday. He was there for less than 10 minutes.""
The BBC has learned that Sue Gray, the senior civil servant compiling a report into gatherings on government premises during Covid restrictions, already knew about the 19 June event.
Her findings are expected to be published later this week.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""This is yet more evidence that we have got a prime minister who believes that the rules that he made don't apply to him. 
""And so we have got a prime minister and a government who spend their whole time mopping up sleaze and deceit.""
Sir Keir also repeated his call for Mr Johnson to resign.
And Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, did the same, saying of 20 June 2020: ""It was the day before what would have been my dad's 73rd birthday, shortly after he had passed away from Covid-19.
""It was a horrible time for my family, but we stuck to the rules, not even being able to hug to comfort each other.""
She added it was ""completely sickening"" that No 10 staff had gathered indoors to eat cake for the PM's birthday, saying: ""While dozens sang Happy Birthday to him, families couldn't even sing in memory at their loved ones' funerals.""
Some Tory MPs, including the party's Scottish leader Douglas Ross, have called on Mr Johnson to go, but many more say they are waiting for Ms Gray's findings before making a judgement.
At total of 54 MPs must write to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, declaring no confidence in the PM, to trigger a leadership contest.
Former Conservative Party chair Baroness Warsi told the BBC News Channel it was time for Mr Johnson to ""think long and hard about what is in the best interest of this country"".
""The question he should be asking himself every morning is, 'Is me staying in office allowing me to run this office in a way in which is making the country better, or am I a distraction?'"" she added.

296;Burkina Faso military says it has seized power;['2022-01-24T19:24:46.000Z'];['BBC News'];['burkina faso'];['power', 'later', 'team', 'mr', 'nations', 'match', 'lay', 'burkina', 'seized', 'win', 'faso', 'taken', 'national', 'nation', 'military'];"
The military in Burkina Faso says it has seized power and overthrown President Roch Kaboré. 
The announcement was made on state television by an army officer, who cited the deteriorating security situation for the military takeover. 
Mr Kaboré had faced growing discontent over his failure to stem an Islamist insurgency. 
His whereabouts are unclear, but the officer said that all those detained were in a secure location. 
The coup comes a day after troops seized barracks, and gunshots were heard in the capital, Ouagadougou. 
Earlier, the ruling People's Movement for Progress (PMP) party said that both Mr Kaboré and a government minister had survived an assassination attempt. 
On Sunday, mutinying troops demanded the sacking of military chiefs and more resources to fight militants linked to the Islamic State (IS) group and al-Qaeda.
The army statement said Mr Kaboré had failed to unite the nation and to deal effectively with the security crisis which ""threatens the very foundations of our nation"".
The statement was issued in the name of a group not heard of previously, the Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration or MPSR, its French acronym.
Although read out by another officer, the statement was signed by Lt-Col Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, who is believed to be the coup leader and a senior commander with years of experience fighting the Islamist militants. 
The statement said that parliament and the government had been dissolved, but promised a ""return to constitutional order"" within a ""reasonable time"".
The military also announced the closure of Burkina Faso's borders. 
UN chief António Guterres condemned the coup and called on the military to ""ensure the protection and the physical integrity"" of Mr Kaboré.
Earlier video footage from the capital appeared to show armoured vehicles - reportedly used by the presidency - peppered with bullet holes and abandoned in the street.
Mobile internet services have been disrupted, though fixed-line internet and domestic wi-fi are working.
Mr Kaboré has not been seen in public since the crisis began, but two posts appeared on his Twitter account before the officer announced he had been toppled. 
The later one called on those who had taken up arms to lay them down ""in the higher interest of the nation"". Earlier, Mr Kaboré congratulated the national football team on their win in an Africa Cup of Nations match.
It is unclear who posted the tweets. 
Some security sources say the president and other government ministers are being held at the Sangoulé Lamizana barracks in the capital.
On Sunday, hundreds of people came out in support of the soldiers and some of them set fire to the ruling party's headquarters.
The coup comes a week after 11 soldiers were arrested for allegedly plotting to overthrow Mr Kaboré.
But discontent has been growing in Burkina Faso over the government's failure to defeat an Islamist insurgency in the country since 2015.
That escalated in November, when 53 people, mainly members of the security forces, were killed by suspected jihadists. And on Saturday, a banned rally to protest against the government's perceived failure led to dozens of arrests.
Similar troubles in neighbouring Mali led to a military coup in May 2021 - one that was broadly welcomed by the public.
In Burkina Faso, mutinying soldiers made several demands, including: the removal of the army's chief of staff and the head of the intelligence service; more troops to be deployed to the front line; and better conditions for the wounded and soldiers' families.

A lone gunman has killed one person and seriously injured three others inside a lecture hall at Heidelberg University in the south-west of Germany, before shooting himself dead.  
He was an 18-year-old German student.
German police said the shooter, who was armed with two guns, had used a ""long gun"", and fired shots around the amphitheatre ""wildly"". 
The bloodshed triggered a large operation at the university's campus in the Neuenheimer Feld area.
Police asked people to avoid the area so rescue workers and emergency services could move around freely. 
German media reported that the gunman appeared to have no religious or political motive.
Police have searched his flat in the city of Mannheim, and found a WhatsApp message he had sent shortly beforehand, in which he spoke of punishing people.
Heidelberg is a university town with about 160,000 inhabitants.
The country has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, and school shootings are rare. Anyone under 25 is required to pass a psychological evaluation before getting a gun licence. 
Police initially said four victims had been wounded, with a later update confirming one had died in hospital.

Six people are reported to have been killed and dozens hurt in a crush outside a stadium hosting an Africa Cup of Nations match in Cameroon.
Video footage showed football fans struggling to get access to the Paul Biya stadium in a neighbourhood of the capital Yaounde.
Naseri Paul Biya, governor of Cameroon's central region, said there may be more casualties, AP News said.
Another report said a number of children had lost consciousness.
The stadium has a capacity of 60,000 but because of Covid restrictions it was not meant to be more than 80% full.
Match officials were quoted as saying that some 50,000 people were trying to attend.
Nurse Olinga Prudence told AP that some of the injured were in a ""desperate condition"".
The last 16 match between Cameroon and Comoros took place despite the incident and ended with a 2-1 win for the hosts.

299;Climate change threatening buried UK treasures;['2022-01-25T00:08:48.000Z'];['By Justin Rowlatt'];['archaeology', 'peatlands', 'climate change'];['threatening', 'change', 'climate', 'used', 'buried', 'place', 'thrown', 'treasures', 'preserved', 'romans', 'quite', 'state', 'opportunity', 'pretty', 'uk', 'potential'];"
Climate change is threatening to destroy treasures buried in the UK as the soils that protect them dry out. 
A Roman toilet seat, the world's oldest boxing glove, and the oldest handwritten letter by a woman are some of the extraordinary objects discovered in at-risk British peatlands.
It means climate change could undermine our understanding of our past, say archaeologists.
About 22,500 archaeological sites in UK may be in danger.
The problem is that changing weather patterns are drying out some peatlands - the waterlogged soils that cover about 10% of the UK.
Because peat contains very little oxygen, organic materials like wood, leather and textiles do not rot. They can survive for thousands of years, preserved by the stable anoxic chemistry of the soil. 
But if the soils dry, oxygen can enter the system, kick-starting the process of decomposition. If that happens artefacts can, quite quickly, rot away.
Excavating these potentially huge sites could cost hundreds of millions of pounds and take decades, by which time they may have been badly damaged.
The trustees of Magna, a Roman fort alongside Hadrian's Wall, fear the process is already under way at the site.
The warnings come as celebrations for the 1,900th anniversary of the start of construction of the wall begin this week.  
The land at Magna has subsided by up to a metre in places in the past decade. It is evidence of ""desiccation"" - the drying of the peat layer - fears Dr Andrew Birley, the chief archaeologist at the site.
It means ""an historical time capsule"" is at risk, he says, because only a tiny part of the site has so far been excavated. 
""This place has the potential to be quite frankly, amazing,"" Dr Birley believes. ""Pretty much everything the Romans used here for 300 or 400 years could have been preserved in more or less the same state it was thrown away, which is an incredible opportunity.""
Another fort a few miles along Hadrian's Wall gives an idea of the astonishing objects that could lie hidden at Magna. 
Digs at Vindolanda have uncovered the world's oldest boxing gloves - so well-preserved that you can still see the imprint of the boxer's knuckles on one. 
More Roman footwear has been discovered here than at any other site in the world.
It is also the source of the oldest handwritten message by a woman found anywhere.
In the note, Claudia Severa, the wife of the commanding officer of a nearby fort, invites her friend Lepidina to her birthday party on 11 September about 1,900 years ago.
""Oh how much I want you at my birthday party,"" writes Claudia. ""You'll make the day so much more fun. I do so hope you can make it. Goodbye, sister, my dearest soul.""  
Day-to-day objects like this provide a unique connection to the lives of ordinary people in ancient times.
""This sort of stuff doesn't normally survive, "" says Dr Birley, who works at both sites. ""It can give us amazing insights into what life was really like here on the Northern frontier almost 2,000 years ago.""
He says the priority at Magna now is to try to work out what is happening underground.
Boreholes have been dug, and electronic equipment measures the water flow and temperature every hour. 
At Teesside University, Dr Gillian Taylor is analysing the chemicals in soil cores from the site to try to understand the processes at work.
It would be a ""catastrophe"" for any organic artefacts if the peat dries, she says. ""The risk is they will disappear. We will lose our heritage if we don't look at what's occurring now.""
Fearing the worst, Dr Birley is planning to dig the first test trenches at the site next year. As a small charity, it's the earliest they can start given the cost and labour needed.
He says if it looks like the condition of the peat is changing rapidly and the treasures could be lost, a full excavation may be necessary.
And changing weather patterns are not just threatening the survival of Roman remains. Experts estimate that there are about 22,500 archaeological sites in or beneath peat in the UK.
Dr Rosie Everett, of Northumbria University, is part of a team that has been assessing the effect of climate change on peatland archaeology across the UK.
She says a host of historic sites in peatlands are under threat, covering the entire sweep of the country's history.
There are Neolithic pathways up to 12,000 years old, and Bronze Age burial sites as well as the remains of more modern settlements and industrial activities.
""Peatlands represent such a small part of the ecology of Britain, but they have massive potential to tell us about our past,"" says Dr Everett.
While an archaeologist working at a ""dry"" site might find 10% of what was once there, at a peatland site they may find as much as 90% of the material culture of ancient communities, say archaeologists.
""The loss of peatlands would have big implications for the understanding of the country's history but also for our climatic history and our environmental history,"" says Dr Everett.
That's why she believes there should be greater efforts to protect them.
Dr Birley agrees. ""If we lose places like this, we lose that direct connection to the people who lived in this island 2000 years ago,"" he says. 
""We lose the chance to learn as much as we can about them. And we lose part of our own heritage and part of our own history.""

300;James Webb telescope parked in observing position;['2022-01-24T19:24:24.000Z'];['Jonathan Amos'];['astronomy', 'nasa', 'european space agency', 'the universe', 'james webb space telescope', 'hubble telescope', 'space exploration'];['space', 'webb', 'telescopes', 'secondary', 'optimised', 'segments', 'observing', 'parked', 'theres', 'telescope', 'mirror', 'position', 'pretty', 'state', 'james'];"
Thirty days after it was launched, the James Webb telescope has arrived at the position in space where it will observe the Universe.
The Lagrange Point 2, as it's known, is a million miles (1.5 million km) from Earth on its nightside.
Webb was finally nudged into an orbit around this location thanks to a short, five-minute thruster burn.
Controllers back on Earth will now spend the coming months tuning the telescope to get it ready for science.
Key tasks include switching on the observatory's four instruments, and also focusing its mirrors - in particular, its 6.5m-wide segmented primary reflector.
""There's a pretty intensive effort to take all of those 18 segments from their current state and get them to act as one big mirror, and also to get the secondary mirror into its optimised condition,"" explained Charlie Atkinson, the chief engineer on Webb at Northrop Grumman, the American aerospace company that co-led the telescope's development with the US space agency (Nasa).
""We do this using the science images, which is why we need to get the science instruments activated and checked out with some initial calibration work,"" he told BBC News.
Webb, billed as the successor to the famous Hubble Space Telescope, was launched on 25 December by an Ariane-5 rocket from French Guiana.
Its overarching goals are to take pictures of the very first stars to shine in the Universe and to probe far-off planets to see if they might be habitable.  
Europe's Ariane-5 gave the new observatory a near-perfect trajectory and velocity to get it out to L2. Even so, two course correction burns were necessary, with the third on Monday tipping Webb into its planned parking position.

The Lagrange Point 2 is one of five gravitational ""sweet-spots"" around the Sun and Earth where satellites can hold their position with few orbital adjustments, thus conserving fuel.
The other advantage is that Webb will not experience at L2 the big swings in temperature and light endured by space telescopes positioned much closer to Earth. 
This is vital for the mission. It's designed to view the cosmos in infrared light and must maintain therefore constant super-cold conditions for its hardware.
Infrared light has waves that are just longer than those of visible light. ""Seeing"" in the infrared will allow the telescope to, for example, look through dust to the see stars that would otherwise be obscured.
Webb will now circle L2, keeping the Earth and the Sun in a near-straight line.
""L2 is pseudo-stable,"" said Jean-Paul Pinaud, who leads the Northrop engineers that keep Webb on track.
""The flight operations team is preparing routine station-keeping burns. They'll be doing those every 20 days or so with the trajectory calculations provided by our flight dynamics team. We'll set them up in a similar way, and then fire the thruster. But the burns will be quite small.""
Hidden behind a big sunshield, Webb's optics and instruments will soon cool to about -230C (some sections of the telescope are already there). When that happens, controllers will switch on Webb's Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) to take a picture of a test star to begin the process of aligning the big mirror.
""We know when we first focus on a star in space, we'll actually see 18 different spots of light because the 18 individual mirror segments won't be aligned,"" said Nasa instrument systems engineer Begoña Vila. 
""But we'll adjust the mirrors to bring all the spots together to make a single star that's not aberrated and good for normal operations.
""It's a long process. It can take up to three months during commissioning, and we are ready to do that,"" she told BBC News.
Focusing involves driving small actuators, or motors, on the back of the 18 segments of the primary mirror to harmonise their curvature. The current misalignment, which is measured in millimetres, will be brought down to one measured in nanometres - a factor of a million improvement.
Similar adjustments will be applied to the 74cm-diameter secondary reflector which sits out in front of the primary mirror and is used to bounce light back towards the instruments.
So far, the Webb mission has not put a step wrong. The launch and journey out to L2 passed off without incident.
And even the complex business of unfolding the telescope after it came off the top of the Ariane rocket was made to look like the easiest of rehearsals.
""We were thrilled with the precision and success of all those deployments,"" said Kyle Hott, the mission systems engineering lead at Northrop.
""It's pretty incredible to think that it was all just a concept on paper decades ago, and now it's actually here, arriving at L2. Morale is high and we're so very excited.""

301;Hippos can recognise their friends' voices;['2022-01-24T18:41:19.000Z'];['By Helen Briggs'];['animals'];['probably', 'telling', 'apart', 'recognise', 'hippos', 'tell', 'strangers', 'researchers', 'neighbours', 'voices', 'friends', 'unfamiliar'];"
Wild hippos are noisy creatures, their calls travelling long distances across lakes and rivers.
But until now the precise function of the loud ""wheeze honks"" the animals make has been a mystery.
Scientists studying hippos at a nature reserve in Africa say the distinctive honks enable the large mammals to tell friend from foe.
And the team says the animals can probably recognise individuals from their ""voices"".
Study leader, Prof Nicolas Mathevon, from the University of Saint-Etienne, in France, has studied the sounds animals make across the world, from leopard seals to hyenas.
He said hippos have a wide vocal repertoire, including grunts, bellows, squeals and ""wheeze honks"", but very little is known about their social communication.
 ""In their call, there is information about the identity of the individual - so they have 'voices' - and they are able to recognise each other by their voices,"" he said. ""This recognition ability supports the social relationships between individuals.""
To find out more about hippo communication, French researchers recorded the sounds of hippos living in the Maputo Special Reserve in Mozambique.
The wheeze-honk is the most common hippo call and the loudest- travelling as far as 1km, according to the study.
The biologists recorded the wheeze-honks of hippos and broadcast these from the shore of lakes to see how other individuals responded.
They found hippos could tell apart friends, neighbours and strangers from their voices. In addition to telling apart friend from foe (or, at least, unfamiliar hippos), the animals can probably distinguish between individuals, according to the researchers - though they can't be absolutely certain of this.
And despite appearing to be lounging around on the water, the large mammals were clearly paying close attention to their surroundings and responded immediately to the broadcasts.
The animals responded more aggressively to unknown hippos - with quicker, louder and more frequent calls, often accompanied by territorial displays of dung spraying.
Prof Mathevon said it was important to learn more about the biology and behaviour of hippos to help avoid human-animal conflicts.
The knowledge might also assist with conservation, he said, as wild hippos are sometimes moved from one location to another to keep local populations healthy.
The work may inspire conservationists to make recordings to allow local hippos to get used to the voice of the new ones before they arrive, he added.
Hippos are not yet endangered in the wild, but their numbers are plummeting fast. They are a source of animal-human conflict, with hippos causing hundreds of human deaths a year.
The research is published in Current Biology.

Taylor Swift has criticised Damon Albarn, lead singer of Blur and later of Gorillaz, after he said that she doesn't write her own music. 
Talking to the LA Times, Albarn replied to the interviewer calling Swift ""an excellent songwriter"" by stating ""she doesn't write her own songs"".
Swift responded on Twitter: ""I was such a big fan of yours until I saw this."" 
""I write all of my own songs. Your hot take is completely false and so damaging."" 
Albarn said in the interview that he prefers Billie Eilish, who he called a ""really interesting songwriter"".
""I'm more attracted to that than to Taylor Swift. It's just darker - less endlessly upbeat. Way more minor and odd. I think she's exceptional.""
Eilish co-writes her songs with her brother, producer Finneas.
When the interviewer said that Swift co-writes her music, Albarn responded: ""That doesn't count. I know what co-writing is. Co-writing is very different to writing. I'm not hating on anybody, I'm just saying there's a big difference between a songwriter and a songwriter who co-writes.""
There was a swift backlash on Twitter, including from producer Jack Antonoff, who has worked with Swift extensively. 
Albarn later apologised, writing to Swift on Twitter: ""I totally agree with you. I had a conversation about songwriting and sadly it was reduced to clickbait. I apologise unreservedly and unconditionally. The last thing I would want to do is discredit your songwriting. I hope you understand.""
This is not the first time Albarn has caused controversy when criticising pop stars. He once reportedly called Adele ""insecure"" after they had worked together on music that was never released. 
""It ended up being one of those 'don't meet your idol' moments,"" she later told Rolling Stone. 
""And the saddest thing was that I was such a big Blur fan growing up. But it was sad, and I regret hanging out with him.""
Albarn later denied calling her insecure, stating the reports were concocted from someone overhearing a conversation with a friend.

304;Ukraine: How will we know if war has started?;['2022-01-25T11:09:57.000Z'];['BBC News'];['ukraine conflict', 'ukraine'];['used', 'know', 'look', 'ukraine', 'war', 'started', 'need', 'moscow', 'toolkit', 'light', 'available', 'conflict'];"
Everyone is trying to second-guess President Vladimir Putin's intentions in Ukraine. The US is pulling embassy staff out as fears rise of looming conflict. But maybe it's already started, writes security and defence expert Jonathan Marcus.
The risk of an all-out war between Russia and Ukraine dominates the headlines. 
All the obvious questions are being asked. Will Russia attack? Is President Vladimir Putin determined upon war come what may? Or can diplomacy secure peace?
But we cannot see inside President Putin's mind.
So here's another question - how will we know when hostilities commence? 
The answer seems obvious. 
Clearly massed Russian tank formations crossing Ukraine's frontiers, or a massive rocket barrage or air strikes against Ukrainian positions, would mark a dramatic escalation in the crisis and a shift to a new phase of the conflict. 
The first alarms will come from the Ukrainian military itself, but Western military satellites and intelligence-gathering aircraft may well spot the preparations for an imminent offensive. 
There will probably be clear signs of an impending onslaught, says Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the US-based Center for Naval Analyses.
Among them are ""the manning of formations"", he says, since a lot of what has been deployed is heavy equipment rather than the troops themselves. Other signs could be ""the dispersal of forces, an influx of logistical and support elements, and a shift in fixed-wing and rotary aviation"".
This video can not be played
But the question can also be answered in another way and for this we need to stand back and view the Russian campaign against Ukraine in its entirety.  
We need to look at the full toolkit available to Moscow and assess how it is being used. And in this light, when you ask -  how will we know if the conflict has started  - then the answer may be that it already has.
Hostilities have actually been under way for some years.
Let's start from where we are. 
In practical terms Russia already occupies Crimea - part of Ukraine - and it provides practical assistance to anti-Kiev rebels in the Donbas region. 
Indeed it was the intervention of Russian armoured and mechanised units against Ukrainian forces in 2014 that prevented the pro-Russian rebels' defeat. Sporadic fighting has continued ever since. All sides supposedly support an international peace effort there, but little progress has been made.
Beyond this pressure there is also the threat to employ overwhelming military force.
The build-up of Russian combat formations around Ukraine's borders is extraordinary.  This includes a significant deployment of forces to Belarus - which also shares a border with Ukraine - which might provide a closer jumping-off point for an assault towards the Ukrainian capital Kiev itself.
This build-up is referred to by Russian spokesmen as an exercise and in no sense threatening. But its scale, the nature of the units deployed, and the arrival of supplies and other ""enablers"" suggest that this is much more than a routine manoeuvre.
Analysts have followed the build-up using civilian satellite photos. Numerous phone videos have been put online showing trains of equipment heading towards Ukraine or Belarus. And assessments of social media postings, correlated with the units seen to be on the move, provide a remarkable insight into what is going on. 
Irrespective of what Moscow may say, Ukraine and its friends in the West have every reason to be worried.
The next tool available to Moscow is an attempt to influence the narrative. 
On the one hand Russia says it is not preparing for war, though it very much looks as though it is. But, just as importantly,  it has a story to tell - a narrative - where far from Ukraine being the victim, it is in fact Russia itself that is threatened. 
This is the substance of the documents handed over to the US which seek to halt and in some ways reverse Nato expansion and create a new sphere of influence for Moscow.
While some aspects of Russia's concerns, like talks on strategic and other weapons systems, are widely seen as a good idea, on Nato expansion it is unlikely to get any change - and it probably knows this.
But the narrative has another purpose too. It is the story that Russia tells to try to shape the way the whole Ukraine crisis is discussed, not just by Western governments or its own citizens, but by you and me, reading and writing this.
By all fair and rigorous independent analysis Russia is preparing for war with Ukraine, whatever its official spokesmen may say.  
There are other possibilities in the Russian toolbox too. Cyber-attack and subversion, for example. Ukraine certainly has been the subject of the former. Just over a week ago a number of government websites were hit though it was far from clear where the attack came from. 
More recently the UK Government has claimed evidence that Moscow has selected individuals to form a new government in Kiev - though whatever the suspicions, there has been no conclusive public evidence confirming Moscow's hand in such activities. 
Michael Kofman says that a cyber element could be an important part of any Russian attack, because they can cripple critical infrastructure and disrupt Ukraine's ability to coordinate a military effort.
When Russia seized Crimea we heard a lot of talk about ""hybrid"" and ""grey-zone warfare"" and the alleged deniability of the operation, whose participants, though uniformed, wore no military insignia. 
But there was no doubt who these troops were. And Crimea was seized with old-fashioned military force, rather than by some esoteric modern method.
What is under way at present is the essence of ""grey-zone warfare"" - the blurring of the boundary between peace and war. 
That's not how we tend to view things in the West. 
But the Russian military has articulated a sophisticated doctrine that sees war and peace as a continuum where different tools are applied at different stages, sometimes in sequence, sometimes together, though with the same strategic aim.  
And that ultimately is why the conflict has already been joined. The only question is how far along the ""grey zone"" continuum President Putin is willing to go.

The Metropolitan Police have launched an investigation into parties held in No 10 during the coronavirus pandemic.
Commissioner Cressida Dick said they were looking into ""potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations"" in Downing Street and Whitehall since 2020. 
She said the investigation was launched as a ""result of the information provided by the Cabinet Office inquiry team"", led by civil servant Sue Gray.  
The BBC understands the report won't be published while police investigate.
Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner has renewed calls for Boris Johnson to resign in light of the inquiry, calling him a ""national distraction"".
She will ask the government an urgent question in the Commons about the police investigation at 12:30 GMT. 
The news comes after fresh allegations of a birthday party being held for the prime minister in June 2020.
Downing Street has admitted that staff gathered inside No 10 to celebrate Mr Johnson's birthday when the first Covid lockdown was still in place.
But ministers have disputed the number of people attending, and called for ""patience"" while Ms Gray's inquiry is carried out to establish the facts. 
Dame Cressida made the announcement about the police investigation while facing questions from the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee on Tuesday. 
She said she understood the ""deep public concern"" about the allegations of parties inside No 10, along with the ""huge sacrifices"" the public had made during the pandemic. 
And she said it would ""not normally be a proportionate use of time"" for the force to investigate rule breaches as far back as two years, but that the police would look at allegations that ""appeared to be the most serious and flagrant breach"" of regulations.
She outlined the guidelines on when allegations of past breaches would be investigated, saying the factors the police considered were: that there was evidence that those involved ""knew, or ought to have known that what they were doing was an offence"", where not investigating ""would significantly undermine the legitimacy of the law"" and ""where there was little ambiguity around the absence of any reasonable defence"".
Dame Cressida would not say which parties were being investigated and said the inquiry did not mean fixed penalty notices would be issued ""in every instance and to every person involved"". 
While she said the force would not give ""a running commentary"" on the case, they would provide updates at ""significant points"".
The first thing is to have a sense of proportion.
When you hear the words, ""Met Police, investigation, criminal, Downing Street"", that sounds incredibly dramatic.
This is a big development in this story, but we are talking about the potential issuing of fixed penalty notices - fines - not about big criminal trials or people going to prison.
So it is important to keep that sense of perspective.
There are also lots of things we don't know about this police investigation. 
We don't know how many of these high-profile parties are now being investigated and crucially we don't know if they were parties attended by the prime minister. 
We also don't know if the prime minister is in the frame for being interviewed by the police.
So, lots of unanswered questions, but it means this row is going to rumble on at a much higher volume for a lot longer. 
London Mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed the investigation, saying: ""The public rightly expect the police to uphold the law without fear or favour, no matter who that involves, and I have been clear that members of the public must be able to expect the highest standards from everyone, including the prime minister and those around him. 
""No one is above the law. There cannot be one rule for the government and another for everyone else.""
His Labour colleague, Ms Rayner, also welcomed the inquiry, but added: ""With Boris Johnson's Downing Street now under police investigation, how on earth can he think he can stay on as prime minister?
""Boris Johnson is a national distraction. Conservative MPs should stop propping him up and he should finally do the decent thing and resign.""
Westminster has been eagerly awaiting the report from senior civil servant Ms Gray into the list of alleged parties that took place over different lockdowns throughout the pandemic, including the birthday party. 
While some Tory MPs have already openly called for Mr Johnson to go, others have said they are waiting to read her report before deciding on the PM's future. 
But while the Cabinet Office has said her inquiry will continue at the same time as the Met's, the BBC understands Ms Gray's final report - which had been expected to be published this week - will now be delayed while the police carry out their own work. 
And it is not yet clear how long the force's investigation will take. 
See how many questions you can get right...

The Metropolitan Police is investigating parties held in Downing Street and Whitehall during the coronavirus pandemic.
It was launched after a separate inquiry, led by civil servant Sue Gray, passed information to the force.
We don't know how many events the police are looking at.
So far the Met has only said it is investigating ""a number of events that took place at Downing Street and Whitehall in the last two years in relation to potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations"".
The decision to start the investigation was the result of information provided by the senior civil servant Sue Gray's inquiry team and ""officers' own assessments"", Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said.
The commissioner said the Met would not normally investigate past breaches of Covid-19 regulations.
But she said retrospective investigations were carried out for ""the most serious and flagrant type of breach"" where there was evidence and certain criteria were met, including:
This video can not be played
In some ways this is a very straightforward investigation for the police, says BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford.
Much of the leg work will have been done and the police need to decide who was at the events and whether they had a good reason to be there, he says.
""This is not a multi-month investigation, this is something that should be containable in a small number of weeks.""
Under the Coronavirus Act, Covid breaches are classified as summary offences. 
This means they do not come with prison sentences, but are punishable by fines. 
During the summer of 2020, the Met Police had the power to fine people £100 for the first Covid offence (lowered to £50 if paid within 14 days). Fines for subsequent offences could then double, up to a maximum of £3,200.
Failure or refusal to pay the fine could result in being prosecuted and having to go to court.
However, the fact the police are investigating Downing Street events does not mean ""fixed penalty notices will necessarily be issued in every instance and to every person involved"", Dame Cressida said.
We don't know for sure as the Met has not said which gatherings it is investigating. 
As well as those it is looking into, Dame Cressida said ""several other events"" had been assessed but were not thought to have reached the threshold for an investigation.
Asked by journalists whether the prime minister was willing to be interviewed by officers, his spokesman responded: ""Anyone asked to will cooperate fully as you would expect.""
Back in 2006, Tony Blair became the first prime minister to be questioned by police in the course of an investigation. 
The investigation was into allegations that peerages were given out in return for donations.
Mr Blair was not interviewed under caution, so he was treated as a witness rather than a suspect.
In July 2007, it was announced that no-one would face charges.
The police investigation could mean that the separate investigation into Downing Street parties - carried out by senior civil servant Sue Gray - will be delayed.
However, a Downing Street spokesman said some parts of the report - the elements not being investigated by the police - could still be published.
The prime minister said he welcomed the Met's announcement because it would ""help to give the public the clarity it needs and help to draw a line under matters"". 
His spokesman said Mr Johnson did not think he had broken the law.
Opposition parties have repeated their calls for him to resign.

307;Pfizer and BioNTech start trials of new Omicron-specific jab;['2022-01-25T16:57:08.000Z'];['By Philippa Roxby'];['coronavirus vaccines', 'pfizer', 'omicron variant', 'coronavirus pandemic'];['requires', 'biontech', 'vaccines', 'jab', 'pfizer', 'trials', 'omicronspecific', 'senior', 'variantbased', 'vaccine', 'staying', 'vigilant', 'start', 'virus', 'vicepresident', 'research'];"
Pfizer and BioNTech have started clinical trials of a new Covid vaccine which targets the Omicron variant.
The companies plan to test the protection gained from the new vaccine as a booster jab and as three separate jabs in unvaccinated people.
More than 1,400 adults are expected to be enrolled in the trial, likely to be in the United States.
US company Moderna is planning to begin trials of its own Omicron-specific shot soon.
Oxford University and AstraZeneca have also started working on a new version of their vaccine.
Vaccine developers had always planned to tweak their original Covid vaccines as new variants emerged, but the arrival of the fast-spreading Omicron strain in the last two months has hastened that process.
Many countries have now offered a booster or third dose of their original vaccine, which has been shown to provide a good level of protection against serious illness and death - even against Omicron.
But protection against infection and mild symptoms is much lower and could decline more quickly.
""Staying vigilant against the virus requires us to identify new approaches for people to maintain a high level of protection, and we believe developing and investigating variant-based vaccines, like this one, are essential in our efforts towards this goal,"" said Kathrin U. Jansen, senior vice-president and head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer. 
Prof Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech, said new data indicated that ""vaccine-induced protection against infection and mild to moderate disease wanes more rapidly than was observed with prior strains"".
""This study is part of our science-based approach to develop a variant-based vaccine that achieves a similar level of protection against Omicron as it did with earlier variants, but with longer duration of protection.""
The companies say they expect to produce four billion doses of their Covid-19 vaccine this year, and this number will include doses of the updated vaccine if trials suggest it is needed.
In the trial of the new vaccine, 615 adults will receive two doses of the current Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, followed by one or two doses of the Omicron-targeted jab.
A second group of 600 who received three doses of the current vaccine will get another of the current one or the Omicron vaccine.
Finally, a small group of 200 unvaccinated adults will receive three doses of the new Omicron-targeted shot.

308;'As an adult I discovered I have siblings, but I grew up in care, alone';['2022-01-26T00:14:02.000Z'];['By Ashley John-Baptiste'];['foster care', 'social work', 'children', 'relationships', 'manchester', 'derby', 'care homes', 'adoption'];['siblings', 'living', 'discovered', 'grew', 'mothers', 'respond', 'lived', 'care', 'spoke', 'established', 'adult', 'overwhelming', 'different', 'took'];"
Ashley John-Baptiste grew up in care believing he was an only child. Then, out of the blue, he received a message from a brother he never knew he had. He set out to explore what being split from siblings means to those who have been in the care system. 
As a toddler, I was placed in the care system. By 18, I had been moved between four foster families and a residential care home in south-east London. 
It's really hard to describe what it was like growing up in so many different homes. It felt like being under a cloud of rejection - no sense of family, no sense of belonging. I did meet my birth mum when I was 10, but never met my dad. I always wondered why I wasn't adopted - was it ever a possibility? 
Living in that residential home with other children gave me my first taste of brotherhood, but we had no control over our relationships in the long term. We would be moved, and disappear from each other's lives. 
Children who are placed in care are given ""life story"" sessions by their local authority - this is where a social worker tells a child what they know about their family background and history. I was around seven when I had mine, and I was told I was an only child.
So it was a huge shock when, in my mid-20s, a man messaged me on Facebook to tell me he was my older brother. I can still remember the visceral sense of confusion I felt when I first saw his message. I had to re-read it several times.  
It took me a while to respond, but when we spoke we established that we had the same dad but different mothers, that there were more siblings out there and - most overwhelming for me - that we lived in the same area. All this time, my brother had been living close by.

Despite the intense curiosity of these initial conversations, we never made plans to meet in person. As much as I welcomed the messages from my new-found brother, I never felt ready to meet face-to-face. Eventually, four years ago, we stopped messaging each other.
But then, in the spring of 2020, as I was taking my new-born baby for a hospital check-up, I bumped into him by chance. I was leaving the hospital, he was making his way in to visit a sick relative. I recognised him instantly.   
I called out to him sheepishly and to my relief, he recognised me.   
We spoke for what seemed like ages. Despite it being our first meeting, there was a natural ease to our conversation. It felt like we had known each other all along.   
I introduced him to my baby daughter. She met her uncle. We took a photo together in an unexpected ""family"" moment.   
Even though we haven't met since, that moment profoundly changed my life.   
Meeting my brother made me think how things could have been different if I had been given the chance to get to know my siblings when I was younger. I now know that I've got at least four, all older than me.   
Every time I moved home as a looked-after child, I was forced to assimilate into a new family, to integrate in a different community and make new friends. My sense of childhood identity was fragmented between the homes I lived in. No single person knew me across all of my moves.   
Meeting my brother made me imagine how things could have been if I'd had regular contact with my siblings during all the twists and turns of care. Imagine if I'd had someone like that to talk to, someone to see me grow up, it would have been a lifeline.   
Even a few meetings a year in while I was in care could have been a foundation for a relationship in adulthood.    
I left care at 18 and lived alone in a council flat, before starting university. Living independently, where I was forced to make ends meet, brought a sense of abandonment and isolation that I wasn't prepared for.   
While I had incredible friends who eased the emotional intensity of leaving care, knowing my siblings at that stage of life might have given me a sense of family and belonging. Maybe there would have been a chance to spend Christmas with family, or have somewhere to go back to between terms at university. 
During our meeting outside the hospital, my brother just seemed to understand everything I was saying. He had an implicit understanding of my journey and outlook. There was a connection.
I am baffled that none of my social workers seemed to know about the existence of my siblings.
When I spoke to my old social worker, Rosalyn Payne, who looked after me between the ages of 15-18, she was surprised to hear I had a brother. So why wasn't there any information about my family in my files? 
Files and information gathering have come a long way, Rosalyn told me. ""Back in the day we had paper files, now we have electronic files."" But that wasn't the only issue, she says. ""Families don't always tell us what we want to know at the time, and that happens quite a lot, where family members withhold information.""  
Then I asked her a question I had never dared ask before - was I ever considered for adoption? 
She told me that I was indeed put up for adoption when I was very young, but the couple who had been planning to adopt me got pregnant and withdrew from the process. 
It was shattering news - realising in that moment that my life could have been completely different.

However tough such questions are, I think they're important. Everybody wants to know who they are, and who they're connected to. 
For the documentary we wanted to get a national perspective on the state of sibling relationships in the care system, but there is a lack of data. 
The BBC sent more than 200 Freedom of Information requests to UK councils - out of all the authorities approached, nearly three-quarters responded. Based on these responses, nearly half of sibling groups in care are split up (45%) with more than 12,000 children separated from at least one of their siblings.
And it can have a life-long impact. 
I met Saskia, 24, from Manchester who was taken into care with her two brothers after being rescued from their birth family. They were adopted, but their new home was no safe haven.  
Saskia and her brothers suffered physical abuse and neglect for a decade in the adoptive home. When the adoption broke down, they went back into council care, where they were soon split up across different placements, in different areas.
Saskia was 11 at the time and contact with her brothers broke down altogether a few years later. She told me that being away from them made her feel like she was ""not strong any more"". 
""I lost such a key part of myself,"" she says. ""It was us three against the world, it always has been. Sometimes siblings are all you have left. If you take those away, you're taking away the last bit of someone's identity.""

Saskia has now trained as a social worker, which has given her a new perspective. In hindsight, she feels they should have been allowed to stay together. 
Her younger brother Toby really struggled and even spent time in prison. Although he has a job now, he told me his childhood experiences have made him into quite a resentful person. ""Even if life's going good, I'll still find some way to be negative in it.""
Since they left care, they have been able to rebuild their relationships. ""My brothers are still in my life. I'm lucky. I see myself as very blessed,"" Saskia says. 
According to the law across all parts of the UK, siblings should be kept together when it is possible and safe to do so. But with a rise in the number of children in care there simply aren't enough foster carers - especially now children need a room of their own. All of this means councils are struggling. 
I spoke to the director of children's social care at Derby City Council, Suanne Lim, who told me that she doesn't have enough resources to fully support the children in her authority's care - even though the government did provide extra funding for vulnerable families during the pandemic. 
""We are very, very stretched. There have been year-on-year cuts to services that we are delivering and yet demand is rising,"" she said. ""Local authorities are close to the bone.""
During the pandemic, Derby City council pioneered a rapid response team to support vulnerable families and prevent even more children from entering the system. Over the past 15 months the team say they have helped 60 families to stay together - and prevented 50 sibling groups from being split up.
It's clear that social workers are under huge pressure. But at the same time, so many looked-after children are separated from their brothers and sisters and don't have the information about their families that they deserve. 
In Scotland, the law has recently been changed to give siblings more control over their relationships. An independent review of the England care system is currently underway, with findings and recommendations expected to be published later this year. 
For me, I have been able to answer more of the questions I had about who I am and where I come from. Even though I didn't grow up with my siblings, I now have the chance to get to know them. But perhaps most significantly, I can tell my daughter she has an uncle.

A sneak peek at brand-new dark psychological thriller Chloe
Lea Campos battled prejudice and patriarchy to become a referee

309;Africa Cup of Nations: A football celebration overshadowed by tragedy;['2022-01-26T00:23:35.000Z'];['BBC News'];['africa today podcasts'];['celebration', 'tragedy', 'football', 'impressions', 'nations', 'special', 'tournament', 'overshadowed', 'major', 'things', 'wanted', 'list', 'piece', 'cup', 'sets', 'africa'];"
In our series of letters from African writers, Algerian-Canadian football journalist Maher Mezahi, who is in Cameroon to cover the Africa Cup of Nations, reflects on how the recent deaths of fans at a stadium has left him with mixed feelings about the tournament.
When I was first asked to do a piece about my impressions about the tournament in Cameroon, I had wanted to compile a list of the things that make it so special and sets it apart from other major football competitions.
I was planning to celebrate African football. 
After all, Afcon is a special tournament, adored by everyone on the continent and intrinsically linked to pan-African values.
The first two in 1957 and 1959, for example, were used in part as a statement against apartheid in South Africa.
Players, fans and journalists have all spoken about how it is closer to the true spirit of football, rather than the more sanitised and corporate tournaments elsewhere. 
There is also the warm and friendly atmosphere as well as the pride that Afcon creates in all countries across the continent. 
Amongst the positive things are the medical protocols to deal with Covid-19, including pulmonary scans.
These are among the strictest in world football and intended to prevent any medical emergencies.
On the terraces, everyone lauds the carnival-like atmosphere that African football supporters manage to generate. 
Recognisable super fans are present at every biennial championship. 
Take Tunisia's ""Reda The Elephant"", who covers his belly in body paint has the best goal reactions, or Ivory Coast's ""Petit Bamba"", who orchestrates the National Elephants' Supporters Committee dance moves.
""The atmosphere is so pure,"" says Alex Cizmic, an Italian freelance journalist, who has often been amazed at the relaxed atmosphere around the teams.
""In 2019 in Egypt, I was fortunate enough to attend one of the Uganda Cranes' training sessions. When it was over, I had a chat with star striker Farouk Miya, who I had never met before,"" he recalls in a surprised tone. 
""Then I arranged a quick call with his former coach Milutin Sredojevic, who I was in contact with. It all felt very familial."" 
And smaller nations have shone.
The Gambia and Comoros were debutants in this edition of the tournament, and they have done their nations proud.
Before The Gambia played their first match against Mauritania, I asked a Gambian friend to write down what he felt as the anthem was playing.
""I felt a real sense of pride, love for country, and honour hearing the Gambian national team anthem for the first time,"" he said.
""When the first goal went in, I couldn't do anything. Deep inside of me I was just proud, knowing what the goal means. It really united our country.""
But in one evening, all of the positive aspects of the Afcon have been overshadowed by a tragedy of unspeakable proportions.
As hosts Cameroon were set to play their second round match against Comoros at the new Olembe Stadium in the capital, Yaoundé, a bottleneck began to build outside. 
At around 19:30 local time, just half an hour before kick-off, thousands of fans were stuck in a crush that ended up killing eight people, including an eight-year-old boy, according to Cameroonian authorities. 
I had arrived at the stadium earlier in the afternoon, but even several hours before the match started, the incessant cordoning off of spectators was irritating. 
I have been to football matches in seven African countries and every time I make the same observation: there are so many police officers and so little safety.
For a stadium with a capacity of 60,000, it seemed extremely odd that journalists, supporters and everyone who was not a VIP were being ushered in through the same gate outside the campus. 
This video can not be played
Covid-19 testing and screening for vaccines further slowed down passage into the stadium. 
I did not know what had transpired until late in the second half when a colleague nudged me in the ribs and whispered: ""There's trouble outside.""
We ran out, but there was nothing to see. 
The only evidence of any problems was a handful of shoes and articles of clothing strewn on the ground.
A few minutes later rumours of deaths began filtering through. 
In the press room, journalists began sharing documents that listed the victims as well as videos of the tragedy. 
The following morning the Confederation of African Football (Caf) accepted shared responsibility for the incident and presented its condolences to the families. 
But matches were not postponed and the tournament is continuing. 
I do not think games should have taken place on Tuesday - the day after the tragedy. 
It seemed disrespectful to the families, and everyone involved in the competition is still trying to process what happened.
It does not feel like a time to talk about or celebrate football.

311;Boris Johnson authorised Afghan animal evacuation, leaked email suggests;['2022-01-26T17:20:02.000Z'];['BBC News'];['afghanistan', 'boris johnson'];['animal', 'prime', 'evacuation', 'johnson', 'leaked', 'worked', 'authorised', 'left', 'boris', 'lying', 'flying', 'minister', 'doing', 'given', 'email', 'suggests', 'priority', 'forces', 'afghan'];"

Boris Johnson authorised the evacuation of animals from Afghanistan during the fall of Kabul, according to emails leaked by a whistleblower.
The PM has previously dismissed as ""nonsense"" claims he intervened in the evacuation of the Nowzad charity, run by former Royal Marine Pen Farthing.
But an email from an official in minister Zac Goldsmith's office suggests he was personally involved.
It is one of a number of emails released by a select committee.
The August 2021 message to another official in the Foreign Office says: ""Charity Nowzad, run by an ex-Royal Marine, has received a lot of publicity and the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated.""
When asked in December if he had prioritised animals over the Afghan people in the evacuation of Kabul, Mr Johnson said: ""That is complete nonsense.""
The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""It remains the case that the PM didn't instruct officials to take any particular course of action.""
And Lord Goldsmith tweeted: ""I did not authorise and do not support anything that would have put animals' lives ahead of peoples'.""
He added that he had never discussed the Nowzad charity ""or their efforts to evacuate animals"" with the prime minister.  
Nowzad operated an animal clinic, dog and cat shelter and donkey sanctuary in Afghanistan, training and employing Afghans.
When the Taliban took control of Kabul, its supporters launched a campaign for evacuation, saying staff were in danger due to their work with foreign organisations and the animals were at risk.
About 15,000 people were airlifted out of the country in August, including Mr Farthing and 150 animals. His staff were left behind, but later made it safely to Pakistan.
The plane evacuating the animals was paid for by donations.
The UK government sponsored clearance for it, leading to allegations that animals had been prioritised over people in the rescue effort.
Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office at the time, told the Foreign Affairs Committee that the animals were evacuated following a direct instruction from Mr Johnson.
An ally of Mr Farthing, animal rights activist Dominic Dyer, told the BBC he had contacted Mr Johnson's wife Carrie to ask the PM to speak to Defence Secretary Ben Wallace about ensuring Mr Farthing and his animals were evacuated.
Mr Wallace has denied being contacted by the prime minister over the case.
He told the BBC the evacuation of Kabul was ""run under my authority and carried out by the UK military through the joint chief of operations"".  
He added: ""At no point were he or I directed by the prime minister to evacuate Pen Farthing, his workforce or his pets.   
""As I made clear at the time, we were not going to put pets before people and as the actions showed, Pen Farthing left last and his workforce had to leave after the evacuation was concluded via other means.""
He said the suggestion that Lord Goldsmith, who he described as a ""Defra minister"", would have had ""any authority or responsibility in the running of the evacuation is ludicrous"". 
Lord Goldsmith has been a joint Defra and Foreign Office minister since February 2020.
The evidence published by the Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday shows Lord Goldsmith's official in the Foreign Office emailed colleagues working on the ""special cases team Bronze"", saying: ""[animal charity - name redacted] are a [details redacted] animal charity operating in Kabul and seeking to evacuation their [details redacted] members of staff (no animals).
""Equivalent charity Nowzad, run by an ex-Royal Marine, has received a lot of publicity and the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated, [animal charity - name redacted] are hoping to be treated in the same capacity.""
In a written statement to the committee, Mr Farthing denied any UK government involvement in the evacuation.
He said: ""The tremendous teamwork shown by many volunteers to facilitate the evacuation of the Nowzad staff and their families, myself and the animals should be applauded not used as a deflection for failings across the board in Afghanistan.""
But Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the leaked emails proved the prime minister had made misleading statements.
""Once again, the prime minister has been caught out lying about what he has been doing and deciding. He should never have given priority to flying animals out of Afghanistan while Afghans who worked for our armed forces were left behind.
""Boris Johnson is unable to make the serious decisions that are needed, at home and for our allies abroad.""
Can they keep their progress hidden from their loved ones?

Boris Johnson has vowed to fight on as prime minister after facing fresh calls to quit over lockdown parties in Downing Street.
MPs are still waiting to see the findings of civil servant Sue Gray's inquiry into the events, which had been expected on Wednesday. 
At a Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir Starmer called on the PM to keep a promise to publish the report in full.
Mr Johnson replied that he would ""do exactly what I said"".
Downing Street has said it is their ""intention"" to publish the report in the format in which Mr Johnson receives it.
The BBC understands that Ms Gray's report is essentially completed, but she has not yet sent it to the prime minister.
It seems likely MPs may have to wait until Thursday - or beyond - to see the report.
Mr Johnson has said he will give the opposition parties time to study its contents before he makes a Commons statement on it. 
Separately, the Metropolitan Police have launched an inquiry into potential Covid-law breaking in Downing Street, after being handed details of parties by Sue Gray.
At a stormy Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said the prime minister had previously told MPs that ""all guidance was followed"" in Downing Street over gatherings during Covid lockdowns.
The Labour leader added: ""So since he acknowledges the ministerial code [governing standards of behaviour and forbidding ministers from misleading the Commons] applies to him, will he now resign?""
Mr Johnson replied: ""No.""
He accused Sir Keir of being ""relentlessly opportunistic throughout"" the pandemic by shifting his position on lockdowns, whereas he had got all the big decisions right.
Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle had to step in several times to calm shouting MPs down, threatening some with expulsion from the chamber. 
Amid continued noise, Sir Keir said: ""The prime minister's continual defence is 'Wait for the Sue Gray report'. On 8 December he told this House, 'I will place a copy of the report in the library of the House of Commons'.
""His spokesperson has repeatedly stated that means the full report, not parts of the report, not a summary of the report, not an edited copy. So, can the prime minister confirm that he will publish the full Sue Gray report as he receives it?""
Mr Johnson replied: ""We've got to leave the report to the independent investigator, as he knows, of course when I receive it, I will do exactly what I said.""
The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, asked Conservative MPs to ""show the prime minister the door"" by triggering a leadership contest.
Mr Johnson has previously apologised for attending a ""bring-your-own-booze"" event in the No 10 garden on 20 May 2020, during the first lockdown, saying he thought it was a ""work event"".
Reports of a birthday party held for Mr Johnson in the Cabinet Room in June 2020 have also come to light this week.
Some Tory MPs have already demanded Mr Johnson's resignation, but many others say they are waiting for the Gray report before deciding whether to submit letters of no confidence in him.
At least 54 of them must write to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, to set up a vote on the prime minister's future.
Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, repeated his staunch defence of the PM, insisting the reported gatherings were work events. 
He added: ""If people are working all day, they have got to eat, they have got to have lunch, they must be allowed to have a cup of coffee during the day."" 
Asked whether that needed to be wine and cake, which was said to be served at the events, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: ""This issue about do people have [an alcoholic] drink when they are working is not absolutely set in stone one way of the other.""
Can they keep their progress hidden from their loved ones?

314;Who is Burkina Faso coup leader Lt-Col Damiba?;['2022-01-26T19:17:13.000Z'];['BBC News'];"['burkina faso', ""burkina faso coup d'état 2022""]";['security', 'turned', 'damiba', 'burkina', 'coup', 'tighten', 'leader', 'faso', 'volatile', 'ltcol', 'troops', 'weeks', 'seven', 'seen', 'shakeup', 'zone'];"
Trained by the US and France in warfare, the young Lt-Col Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba turned on his political masters in Burkina Faso by seizing power in a coup. 
He anointed himself president just three weeks after celebrating his 41st birthday, making him the latest man in camouflage to overthrow a government, and raising fears that what UN chief António Guterres last year called the ""epidemic of coups"" - in countries ranging from Sudan to Myanmar - could continue into the new year. 
Sporting a red beret, Lt-Col Damiba sat impassively - as Reuters news agency put it - in a low-lit studio on Monday evening, leaving a captain to announce on state television that he had toppled President Roch Kaboré, a former banker who is now his prisoner.
Holding the grand title of ""President of the Patriotic Movement for Safeguarding and Restoration"",  Lt-Col Damiba forms the West African triumvirate of military rulers - along with Guinea's charismatic Col Mamady Doumbouya, who was also born in 1981, and Mali's bearded Col Assimi Goïta, who is the youngest of the trio, having been born in 1983. 
Though they have become political pariahs in much of Africa and the West for seizing power through the barrel of the gun, the trio appear to have significant public support in their countries - all former French colonies. 
""As far as we're concerned, it's not a coup,"" school teacher Julienne Traore told AFP news agency as crowds celebrated in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou. 
""It's the liberation of a country, which was being governed by people who were incompetent,"" the teacher added.
This view was expressed despite the fact that Lt-Col Damiba has neither addressed the nation nor granted media interviews since seizing power, suggesting he is, at the least, publicity-shy - not ideal for a president. 
A well-connected West African security source told the BBC: ""He is not very talkative but when he does talk, you should take him seriously.
""He is a born leader and is very close to the men he commands, rather than keeping his distance from them. For him, results on the grounds are what matters.""
He seems to have good political antennae, having refused to throw his weight behind a 2015 coup that proved to be so unpopular that the military relinquished power a mere seven days later, opening the way for Mr Kaboré to be elected to office about two months later.

Lt-Col Damiba also seems to be academically oriented, having authored West African Armies and Terrorism: Uncertain Responses? - a book on the biggest crisis facing Burkina Faso, the Islamist insurgency which has left about 2,000 people dead since 2015 and about 300,000 children without education after their schools were forced to close.
In the statement read on his behalf by the captain who announced the coup, Lt-Col Damiba cited the deteriorating security situation as the chief reason for overthrowing Mr Kaboré.
He turned on the president despite the fact that he had been promoted about seven weeks earlier to lead anti-terrorism operations in the volatile northern zone, which includes Ouagadougou, in what was seen as a military shake-up by Mr Kaboré to tighten his grip on power and to placate troops angered by the killing of more than 50 security force members in November. 
The security source said that Lt-Col Damiba's decision to strike against his former boss did not come as a surprise, as ""he is someone who doesn't do things by half-measures"".
""He sees the issue of jihadist insurgencies as a complex problem, which cannot be solved through military means alone. 
""This isn't an easy thing for a soldier to say but he is someone who says what he thinks,"" the source said. 
Lt-Col Damiba's background is similar to that of many of Burkina Faso's military elite - he studied in France at a military academy and a prestigious institution where he got a Master's in criminal sciences, and served in the presidential guard of the now-exiled Blaise Compaoré, who maintained strong ties with the former colonial power when he ruled with an iron-hand from 1987 to 2014. 
More recently, Lt-Col Damiba received military training from the US, as it increasingly turned its attention to West Africa to fight militant Islamists who have gained a foothold in the region. 
The US Africa Command confirmed to The New York Times that Lt-Col Damiba took part in American military courses and exercises between 2010 and 2020, and received instruction on the law of armed conflict, and respect for human rights. 
But the security source the BBC spoke to said they did not expect Lt-Col Damiba to be beholden to any foreign power. 
""He believes that Africa should bear responsibility for its own problems, rather than relying on the West, or anyone else.""
The jury is out on that - some supporters of Lt-Col Damiba carried Russian flags as they celebrated the coup in Ouagadougou, calling on Russia to help in the fight against the militant Islamists.
They were taking their cue from Mali, where the junta is said to have brought in Russia's controversial Wagner group to defeat the insurgents, to the chagrin of 15 European nations who - along with Canada - issued a statement in December saying they ""deeply regret"" the decision to use ""already scarce public funds"" to pay foreign mercenaries.
Can they keep their progress hidden from their loved ones?

316;Ghislaine Maxwell: What the trial means for Prince Andrew;['2021-12-30T15:09:45.000Z'];['By Dominic Casciani'];['prince andrew, duke of york', 'ghislaine maxwell', 'jeffrey epstein', 'united states'];['trial', 'specifically', 'place', 'reason', 'plans', 'means', 'maxwell', 'prince', 'epstein', 'present', 'unwitting', 'paedophile', 'ghislaine', 'andrew', 'woman'];"
Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted of grooming teenagers for abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. What are the implications for her former friend Prince Andrew?
The guilty verdict comes as lawyers for the senior royal prepare to go to the same federal court in Manhattan, New York, to defend him against a damages claim brought by one of Epstein's victims. 
So what does Maxwell's trial mean, if anything, for the prince? 
The most obvious and important thing to bear in mind about Maxwell's conviction is that it applies only to what she did. Nobody else was on trial. The Duke of York is not facing a criminal prosecution in the United States. He's being sued by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of Epstein's victims. 
In fact, the trial heard no evidence that Prince Andrew was ever allegedly involved in wrongdoing. 
During his 2019 BBC interview, Prince Andrew told Newsnight that his relationship with Epstein was a product of his long-standing friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell. 
Specifically, he said he and Epstein first met in 1999 - and his closeness to Maxwell was the only reason he got to know the paedophile financier in the first place. Yet throughout this trial, Maxwell's accusers did not present her as some kind of unwitting helper for Epstein, but a woman who was central to his plans to commit abuse. 
If Ghislaine Maxwell had been acquitted, that could have immediately undermined Virginia Roberts Giuffre's claims, because she alleges in court papers that the British socialite ""spent years overseeing and managing Epstein's sex trafficking network, and actively recruited underage girls, including [herself]"". 
And so the conviction means Ms Giuffre's lawyers can go into her case against Prince Andrew saying it's now beyond reasonable doubt that Maxwell played a role in Epstein's abuse. The senior royal's relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell is now as important to the evidence in the damages case as his relationship to Epstein. 
Ms Giuffre's court filings repeatedly stress that Epstein was close enough to the Duke to attend his 40th birthday party and have contact numbers for him. The Maxwell case has not knocked any of this down.
During the trial, prosecutors disclosed new pictures of Maxwell and Epstein to emphasise how close they were. And one photo shows the pair relaxing at a log cabin within the Queen's enormous private Scottish estate, Balmoral.
The picture is thought to have been taken in 1999 when Prince Andrew reportedly invited the couple to stay at the castle.
While casual acquaintances don't get to stay at one of the most guarded, secure and secluded locations in the UK, it's not proof that the Duke was either involved in any wrongdoing or indeed aware of it. 
One of the witnesses against Maxwell, known only as ""Carolyn"", told the trial that she had been introduced to Epstein by Virginia Roberts, as she then was. 
And a former Epstein employee recalled seeing Ms Giuffre at the financier's estate in Florida. So why did she not give evidence? 
Well firstly, she was not named on the indictment as one of the victims of abuse in the Maxwell trial. So there was no legal need for the jury to consider what she has to say. 
But she could still have been called. Prosecutors have remained tight-lipped. Some reporters in New York speculate Ms Giuffre was not called because her prominence would have been distracting - or that Maxwell's lawyers would have latched on to alleged inconsistencies in her media accounts. 
It's also possible that prosecutors, grappling with differing US state laws concerning age of consent, kept her out to simplify the trial.
But as the New York Times put it, her story loomed over the trial. It looks like her words will now go untested until she potentially gives evidence in her damages case against Prince Andrew.
They introduced evidence about Epstein's activities at Maxwell's London home - where Ms Giuffre alleges she was later trafficked to Prince Andrew. A claim the prince strongly denies.
The evidence the jury heard didn't relate to that specific claim.
The witness known only as ""Kate"" said Maxwell befriended her in 1994 and invited her to tea at her Belgravia home. Maxwell then groomed her into a sexual encounter there with Epstein, she said. Kate was also later flown to the financier's Florida home, where Maxwell was said to have given her a schoolgirl's uniform to wear.
Her evidence was clearly part of an attempt by prosecutors to demonstrate how Maxwell identified women to satisfy Epstein's demands.
But Kate was above the age of consent in the UK and therefore the judge ruled that the jury could not consider her story as evidence of a crime committed by Maxwell - and her lawyers challenged the inclusion of the story in the trial.
More importantly for the Duke, Kate's story did not substantiate any suggestion that Maxwell trafficked young women for Epstein's friends. 
While the world has seen the photograph of the Duke with Virginia Roberts, as she then was, in Ghislaine Maxwell's home, he only came up in Kate's London-related evidence in a peripheral way: the court heard how Maxwell would name-drop him and other rich and famous people she knew. 
Prince Andrew confirmed to Newsnight he had been in Maxwell's Belgravia home previously - but said he had no recollection of meeting Ms Giuffre or that photograph being taken. 
So given Maxwell's trial heard nothing at all linking Prince Andrew to abuse in London, one of Ms Giuffre's most explosive allegations remains unproven.
Larry Visoski, Epstein's long-time pilot, told the trial that he had flown Prince Andrew and other celebrities to luxury destinations. The Duke of York had previously told Newsnight he had been on that plane. 
Epstein's accusers say that jet was the ""Lolita Express"" - a means of moving around both his confidantes and the girls groomed into his control. 
If the damages case goes ahead, the flight logs may be important evidence for either side, depending on what they reveal about who was flown to where and when. 
One of Maxwell's accusers, ""Jane"", recalled being on the jet with the Duke - but she did not accuse him of wrongdoing. 
The jury also acquitted Maxwell of enticing Jane to travel from Florida to Manhattan so that Epstein could have sex with her.
The Metropolitan Police has so far decided, having reviewed material from the US civil courts and media, to take no action over allegations of criminality in the UK relating to Jeffrey Epstein. It's never confirmed whether or not it has looked at Ms Giuffre's allegations against Prince Andrew, in line with its policy of rarely confirming the identity of anyone alive who features in its work.
The question is whether it will be compelled to rethink that position given Maxwell's criminal conviction in a case that included events in London.
Given that Kate's London-related evidence did not cover a crime and related only to the dead financier and Maxwell, it's difficult to see the London force changing its position.
Can they keep their progress hidden from their loved ones?

A National Guard conscript in Ukraine has shot dead five people and injured another five in the eastern city of Dnipro, the interior ministry says.
The 20-old-year man opened fire as guard members were being issued weapons at the Pivdenmash aerospace plant at 01:40 GMT on Thursday.
The soldier - named as Artemiy Ryabchuk - is now on the run with a Kalashnikov assault rifle. Police have launched a search operation in the city.
The motive for the attack is unclear.
One of the victims was a female member of Ukraine's National Guard, the interior ministry says.
Pivdenmash - known as Yuzhmash during its Soviet period - is a state-owned plant that produces and tests material related to aeronautics and defence.

318;Finding love as a trans woman;['2022-01-23T00:57:57.000Z'];['BBC News'];['relationships', 'dating', 'dating apps', 'lgbt', 'transgender people', 'california'];['thing', 'met', 'josh', 'finding', 'trans', 'love', 'joshs', 'walked', 'younger', 'family', 'woman', 'told'];"
Trans woman Daniella McDonald says dating straight men was a ""horror show"", until she met Josh, with whom she has been in a relationship for two-and-a-half years. But she says straight men may slowly be becoming more receptive to the idea of dating trans women. Daniella told her story to BBC Gender and Identity correspondent Megha Mohan.
This report contains language that some might find offensive
At the sound of the bait splashing gently into the lake, Josh turned to me and we locked eyes. Next to him stood my father, but unlike Josh he was looking straight ahead, holding a fishing rod and hoping to catch the region's famous trout.
My family was camping at Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. It's a spellbinding tourist attraction, known for its grand mountains and clear lakes, winding hiking trails and unpolluted sky. 
Josh smiled at me. My family loves the outdoors and it was lovely to see how much he did too. But this moment was more than that unspecified relief of finding out that your boyfriend fits in effortlessly with your family. Looking at the two men in my life standing next to each other in quiet contentment, I had an overwhelming feeling of peace. There was a time that I couldn't have imagined this.
Before Josh, dating was a horror show. 
Like many people my age, I used dating apps.
I'm fairly conservative when it comes to what I want from a romantic relationship: monogamy, companionship, someone I can take turns to make breakfast with, someone who would be there to support me with my long hours as a medical student at the University of California in San Diego. So my online profile reflected that. I had written a standard dating profile, except for the first two words I used to describe myself: ""transgender woman"". 
I don't hide my gender identity, I am always upfront from the beginning. I began transitioning physically at the age of 26, but I had been living as Daniella for years. 
While embracing life as a woman, I never really connected with the debates about trans people in the media.
My trans friends and I aren't endlessly discussing which bathrooms to go to or what pronouns to use. We're talking about what most young people talk about: relationships. 
As a woman who is attracted to men, I wanted to be with a man who was attracted to women. 
But I wasn't prepared for the behaviour of some of the men on the app.
The majority of direct messages on my dating profile were just awful. I would wake up to DMs calling me a ""tranny"", my phone would ping with the words, ""You're a man."" I would get paragraph-long death threats with detailed fantasies on how I should be murdered.
Less extreme, but still troubling, were the men who had a perverse interest in trans women. They saw me as a temporary exotic experiment  and failed to observe respectful boundaries. Our early conversations focused on questions about my genitals and what kind of sex we'd have. 
Then there were also kind men who wanted to be with me, but dating them was still a challenge.
The good-on-paper men who were interested and respectful to me in private, were embarrassed to be seen in public with a trans woman. These men wouldn't introduce me to their family or friends. Some would say that they would lose their jobs if their employer found out they were dating a trans woman. To me it seemed like internalised homophobia, they couldn't think of me as a woman and they didn't want the people in their life to view them as gay. 
Those experiences were hard for me, really hard. 
I remember once being picked up and driven for a movie date. I was so excited, and as he was purchasing tickets, I thought ""Wow, this man is really sweet and we're on a nice, 'typical' date.""
Then, as we sat down in the dark cinema and the trailers began to play before the main movie, he turned to me and said, ""I just don't think I can do this."" And he got up and walked out. I followed him to the front where he got a refund on the tickets and he walked away, leaving me to make my own way back home.
I was devastated. It was a constant cycle of humiliation where it felt that there was something wrong with me, something fundamentally unlovable.
Maki Gingoyon, based in the Philippines, runs the dating website, My Transgender Date, with her partner, Cyril Mazur. Maki says that when the site started in 2013, 1.5 million profiles were set up immediately, but only a few hundred people were active. Eight years later, the number of active members has risen to 120,000, and a growing number of straight, young cisgender (non-transgender) men seeking trans partners now feel confident posting their photographs.
""We set up the site in 2013 because we wanted a decent and safe place for trans women and cisgender men to find meaningful romantic relationships with each other,"" Maki says. ""Trans people find solace and community in online spaces, but they can also be spaces that are humiliating. However, things are changing. I can confidently say that the numbers of these kinds of relationships are increasing.""
And then I met Josh.
He messaged me on a dating app and it felt different. Josh is five years younger than me and in the US military. He comes from a large and loving Filipino-American family and he told them all about me - including my gender identity - once he knew we were serious. There was some surprise as they got their heads around the reality that their son was with a trans woman, but they were always kind. The first relative I met of Josh's was his sister, and I could see the happiness on his face as he introduced us and saw that she and I connected.  Over the months, I met Josh's entire family. The first thing his grandpa said when I walked in was, ""Josh, she's so beautiful.""
I once asked Josh how he was so open, and so unlike many other straight men when it comes to love, and he said that a trans woman had been a part of his circle of friends and he didn't think of her as just her identity. The power of just knowing a trans person opened him up. He said he didn't see a difference between dating me and dating a cisgender woman. He says we have ""normal love"".
That was two-and-a-half years ago and we've been together since. Josh and I have the same challenges and discussions about our future as any other couple. And while I have a large circle of queer friends who embrace all kinds of relationships, I'd say ours is quite traditional (whatever that is). 
The biggest hurdle right now is the time we have to spend apart because of our careers. Josh has to spend months at a time training with the US military and I am currently studying at medical school for 12 hours a day. 
But I also have another ambition. With my friend Avi Manullang, who is also trans and a nurse, I want to launch a dating app for trans people and for non-trans people who are open to accepting people with different gender identities.
Trans women experience disproportionate levels of sexual violence so we are working on mechanisms to ensure safety. Everyone should have a right to live and love with dignity. 
I'm hopeful for the future. When I was growing up the only trans people I saw on TV were objects of ridicule on shows like Jerry Springer. Now we have young actors who are openly trans. People like Hunter Schafer from the TV show Euphoria who are very open about their identity in a cool and understated way. 
As people become more used to seeing different gender identities, I know minds will change and you will see more relationships like mine and Josh's. I'm definitely not saying that everyone needs to be open to dating trans people - by no means am I saying that. But more people need to be open to the idea that cis-trans love exists and it's OK.
My relationship is currently the exception to the rule and not the rule, but I do think it's getting better, especially with the Generation Z's being able to be more comfortable about gender diversity and being open and public about it. There are more than 3.7 million views on the hashtag cistranscouple on TikTok.  And I'm really excited about that.

319;Ukraine: What sanctions could be imposed on Russia?;['2022-01-27T11:31:16.000Z'];['By James Landale'];['russia', 'ukraine conflict'];['russia', 'impose', 'price', 'willing', 'ukraine', 'effective', 'sanctions', 'high', 'tradeoffs', 'economic', 'imposed', 'line', 'west'];"
Western powers are threatening severe economic sanctions against Russia if it were to invade Ukraine. 
Western diplomats are refusing to be explicit about specific penalties to keep Russia guessing and maximise their deterrent effect. So what sanctions might the West be planning?
One measure being considered would be to exclude Russia from the system known as Swift - a global financial messaging service. It is used by many thousands of financial institutions in more than 200 countries. 
Boris Johnson told MPs that banning Russia from this would be a ""potent weapon"". It would effectively make it very hard for Russian banks to do business overseas. 
This sanction was used against Iran in 2012 and the country lost significant oil revenues and a large chunk of foreign trade. 
But this sanction would have an economic cost for countries like the United States and Germany whose banks have close links to Russian financial institutions. 
The US could ban Russia from financial transactions involving US dollars. Essentially, any western firm that allowed a Russian institution to deal in dollars would face penalties. 
This would mean that Russia would be extremely limited in what it could buy and sell around the world. 
This could have a huge impact on Russia's economy as most of its oil and gas sales are settled in dollars. 
Western powers could take action to block further Russia's access to international debt markets. 
The ability of Western institutions and banks to buy Russian bonds is already restricted - those curbs could be tightened. 
This would deprive the country of access to finance that it needs to grow its economy. The country's cost of borrowing might rise and the value of the Rouble might fall. 
Russia has prepared for this by reducing the amount of debt held by foreign investors. 
The US could simply blacklist some Russian banks, making it almost impossible for anyone in the world to conduct transactions with them. 
Moscow would have to bail out the banks and do what it could to avoid inflation rising and incomes falling. 
This would, though, have a major negative impact for western investors with money in those Russian banks. 
The West could restrict the export of key commodities to Russia. 
The US could, for example, stop companies selling any goods containing American technology, software or equipment. 
This could involve, in particular, semiconductor microchips, which are used in everything from cars to smart phones, machine tools to consumer electronics. 
This would target not just Russia's defence and aerospace sectors, but whole swathes of its economy. 
Russia's economy is hugely dependent on selling gas and oil overseas. The sales are huge source of revenue for the Kremlin. 
The West could make it illegal for countries and companies to buy oil from the big Russian energy giants such as Gazprom or Rosneft. 
A new gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany - called Nord Stream 2 - could be abandoned. It is ready to start operations but still awaiting regulatory approval.  
But, any curbs on Russian gas would raise prices across Europe, much of which is dependent on energy from the east. 
New sanctions could be targeted at individuals, including not only associates of Vladimir Putin but also the Russian President himself. 
This would most likely involve punishing acts of hostility against Ukraine or threatening its sovereignty or territorial integrity. 
Asset freezes and travel bans are the most likely options. But many such sanctions are already in force and have yet to change much Russian behaviour. 
The hope of US and European powers is that Russia's elite would put pressure on Mr Putin if they were unable to access their wealth in foreign countries and educate their children in western schools and universities. 
Some sanctions could be imposed to restrict the ability of Russian individuals to invest and live in London. 
Such is the scale of Russian money in banks and property in the UK that the capital has been dubbed ""Londongrad"". 
The UK government claims it is tackling this problem with ""unexplained wealth orders"", which require people to say where their cash has come from. 
But only a handful of these orders have ever been used. Some US organisations want the White House to push the UK harder on this. 
The main difficulty for the West is to decide what sanctions should be imposed and when. There are differences between countries on this. 
How much should the sanctions depend on the scale and nature of any Russian attack? If, to quote President Biden, there was a ""minor incursion"", what sanctions would be justified? And who should deploy them? 
When asked about this, US officials say there is unity of purpose but admit there might be a ""division of labour"" with different countries imposing different sanctions. 
Russia could also mitigate the impact of western sanctions by looking to China and other allies for support. 
The bottom line is that the most effective economic sanctions often come at a high price for those who impose them. There are trade-offs and not everyone in the West is willing to acknowledge them.

320;F35-C fighter jet: Race is on to reach sunken US plane... before China;['2022-01-27T16:47:18.000Z'];['By Claire Hills'];['china', 'us armed forces'];['china', 'mystery', 'confirm', 'retrieve', 'sunken', 'came', 'happens', 'bed', 'ocean', 'navy', 'plane', 'race', 'lying', 'jet', 'reach', 'f35c', 'fighter', 'long'];"
A bizarre race against time is under way for the US Navy to reach one of its downed fighter jets - before the Chinese get there first.
The $100m F35-C plane came down in the South China Sea after what the Navy describes as a ""mishap"" during take-off from the USS Carl Vinson.
The jet is the Navy's newest, and crammed with classified equipment - and, as it is in international waters, is technically fair game.
Whoever gets there first, wins.
The prize? All the secrets behind this very expensive, leading-edge fighting force. 
Seven sailors were injured when the jet came down on Monday after it struck Vinson's deck during a military exercise. 
It is now lying on the ocean bed, but what happens next is a mystery. The Navy will not confirm either where it came down or how long it will take to retrieve it.
China claims almost the entire South China Sea and has increasingly taken steps to assert that claim in recent years, refusing to recognise a 2016 international tribunal ruling saying it had no legal basis.
National security experts say Chinese military would be ""very keen"" to get to the jet but a US salvage vessel looks to be at least 10 days away from the crash site.
That's too late, says defence consultant Abi Austen, because the black box battery will die before then, making it harder to locate the aircraft. 
""It's vitally important the US gets this back,"" she says. ""The F-35 is basically like a flying computer. It's designed to link up other assets - what the Air Force calls 'linking sensors to shooters'.""
China doesn't have that technology so getting their hands on it would give them a huge leap forward, she says.
""If they can get into the 35's networking capabilities, it effectively undermines the whole carrier philosophy.""
Asked if there were echoes of the Cold War here, she says: ""It's all about who's the biggest dog in the park! This is basically The Hunt For Red October meets The Abyss - it's a brilliant three-act play.""
Ms Austen, a former adviser to the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and former senior Nato and EU diplomat, said she believes any attempt by China to try to claim salvage rights was them ""stress testing"" the US.
It comes at a vulnerable and dangerous time following what some perceived as a disorganised and disastrous Afghanistan pull-out, she believes.
There is no doubt China wants this plane, although cyber espionage may mean they already have some knowledge of its interior, layout and workings, says Bryce Barros, a China affairs analyst and security fellow at the Truman Project.
""I think they would want to see actual parts of the plane, to better understand how it is laid out and find its vulnerabilities.""
The US Navy acknowledged in a statement that a recovery operation was under way following the ""mishap"" aboard USS Carl Vinson.
This video can not be played
So how would the retrieval actually work?
A team from the US Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving would attach bags to the jet's fuselage which will then be slowly inflated to raise the wreckage. 
This operation will be more difficult if the airframe is not largely in one piece. 
The aircraft was likely to have been armed with at least a couple of missiles carried either on its wings or in the internal weapons bay which could also complicate recovery. 
There is precedent for these winner-takes-all military cat and mouse games.
In 1974, at the height of the Cold War, the CIA secretly pulled a Russian submarine from the sea floor off the coast of Hawaii using a giant mechanical claw 
Two years earlier, the Chinese military secretly salvaged the UK submarine HMS Poseidon which sank off China's east coast.
And it is widely believed that China got its hands on the wreckage of a secret US ""stealth"" helicopter that crash-landed in the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in 2011.
Mr Barros said: ""We are sure the Chinese military got to see the onboard equipment and software then.""
The Guinness World Record-holding deepest successful salvage operation was the raising of the wreckage of a US Navy transport aircraft from the floor of the Philippine Sea in May 2019. 
It was some 5,638m (18,500 ft) below the surface,
One other option, of course, is to destroy the jet to stop it getting into the hands of Beijing.
""The easiest thing to do would be to torpedo it!"" said one military officer.
But that's not thought to be an avenue under consideration.

321;US Supreme Court: The women in the running to replace Stephen Breyer;['2022-01-27T18:19:50.000Z'];['BBC News'];['us supreme court', 'united states', 'joe biden'];['left', 'students', 'league', 'judge', 'breyer', 'looking', 'running', 'means', 'meaning', 'women', 'law', 'university', 'supreme', 'outside', 'court', 'replace', 'stephen'];"
US President Joe Biden has affirmed that he will appoint an African-American woman to the top US court for the first time in history.
She will take up a seat to be vacated by liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who will retire in June.
Appearing with Mr Breyer on Thursday, Mr Biden promised a replacement with the ""experience and integrity"" needed for the role.
He said he'll announce his nominee by the end of February. Three judges are considered top contenders.
Ketanji Brown Jackson, 51, is widely believed to be the top contender to replace Justice Breyer.
Born in Washington DC, Ms Jackson currently serves on the influential US Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC circuit. Three current justices previously served on the court.
Previously, Ms Jackson also served as a district court judge in DC from 2013 to 2021.
The jurist has two degrees from Harvard University, which she attended as an undergraduate and as a law student, once serving as editor of the Harvard Law Review.
Ms Jackson has also clerked for three federal judges in the past, most notably Justice Breyer himself from 1999 to 2000.
In January 2021, she was among President Biden's very first judicial picks, to fill the court seat vacated by his current Attorney General Merrick Garland.
At that confirmation hearing, former House Speaker and Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan introduced her; Mr Ryan is a relative by marriage. 
""Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji's intellect, for her character, for her integrity, it is unequivocal,"" he said.
Leondra Kruger, 45, is in her eighth year on the California Supreme Court.
Born to a Jamaican immigrant mother and a Jewish father, the Pasadena native is a graduate of Harvard University and Yale Law School, where she was the first black woman to serve as editor of the Yale Law Journal.
Ms Kruger previously worked in the Obama Department of Justice, from 2007 to 2013.
During her tenure, she argued 12 cases before the US Supreme Court as deputy to the Solicitor General, the official who represents the government before the high court.
She reportedly twice turned down offers to serve as the Solicitor General.
The jurist also once clerked for late Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.
Julianna Michelle Childs, 55, has served on the federal bench in South Carolina since 2010.
She also previously served as a circuit court judge in the state.
Unlike Ms Jackson and Ms Kruger, Ms Childs did not attend an Ivy League school, instead going to the University of South Carolina Law School.
In private practice, she was the first black female partner at a major law firm in the state. 
Congressman Jim Clyburn, an influential black politician in the state whose endorsement of Mr Biden is widely credited with turning his 2020 campaign around, has advocated for Ms Childs to be nominated because of her unorthodox resume.
Most recently, Mr Biden nominated Ms Childs to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Black women make up only about three percent of the federal judiciary, according to data from the Federal Judicial Center, the court system's research arm.
Dr Taneisha Means, a political science professor at Vassar College, who researches race and judicial politics, says that a history of racism, sexism and elitism in the legal profession contributes to the scarcity.
Black law students are often left on the outside looking in because they did not go to an Ivy League university, or because they never clerked for a federal judge, said Dr Means, meaning few ever become eligible for the high court.
Ms Means added that a gruelling confirmation process in the US Senate likely makes federal judgeships even less palatable. Recent analysis indicates non-white nominees often face much longer waits than their white counterparts to be confirmed by the mostly white chamber.
Strengthening the diversity of the judicial branch has been a key priority for the Biden administration.
The Senate confirmed 40 new district and appellate judges last year, the most for a president in his first year since Ronald Reagan in 1981. Among them are the first openly LGBT female judge, the first Muslim American judge and five black women.

322;Why Boris Johnson is coming out fighting;['2022-01-27T14:55:45.000Z'];['Laura Kuenssberg'];['conservative party', 'boris johnson'];['coming', 'old', 'boris', 'sitting', 'reminded', 'opposition', 'try', 'johnson', 'leadership', 'newscast', 'fighting', 'remind', 'told', 'hari'];"
There's a police investigation and an official inquiry into rule breaking under Boris Johnson's roof is coming any day - Monday seems most likely now, since you ask, although you'd be forgiven for giving up trying to set your watch by it.
The report is likely to be grisly, acutely embarrassing for No 10 and for the civil service, with the expectation that the subsequent Met investigation will lead to a fair number of people who worked in No 10 receiving fixed penalty notices for flouting the regulations they designed and set themselves. 
The Conservatives have slipped in the polls, many dozens of Tory MPs are deeply fed up and there has been, for weeks, open discussion of whether or not it might be time for the party to move him on.
And whatever you think of the saga, whether it's silly frippery, or whether it enrages you and brings back terrible memories of suffering during lockdown, the fact that No 10 is having to spend so much time and focus on battling through means inevitably, other important decisions or debates are getting squeezed out. 
One Tory figure working with the government on various policies says: ""Government is totally gummed up - it's horrible, nothing gets done or signed off."" 
Why then, as another bumpy week draws to a close, are Boris Johnson's closest supporters not at their wits' end? 
After weeks of allegations and claims and political mess, a band of his longstanding political friends now have what they seem to believe is a decent operation in place to shore him up. 
The prime minister has been seeing ""possibles"" and ""undecideds"" in Parliament - MPs who might be tempted to withdraw their support, or haven't yet made up their minds. 
Boris Johnson himself is said to be ""not in a bad place"" about what's going on, buoyed by a feisty outing at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. 
What his former adviser and old friend Guto Hari told us on BBC Newscast: ""What he did was remind not only the opposition of what they are up against when he is on form, but reminded anyone sitting behind him or alongside that front bench what they would be up against if they try to take the leadership of him. 
""It was a display of the alpha male gorilla in the jungle.""
There was no sign whatsoever of the contrite or apologetic impression Boris Johnson has sometimes given in the last few days - a display perhaps designed to show those who want him gone that he will fight and fight. 
It's hardly the first time he's had to wriggle through controversies. Here he was confessing to his strategy many years ago:
""I've got a brilliant new strategy, which is to make so many gaffes that nobody knows which one to concentrate on,"" he told the BBC's Booktalk in 2006.
""They cease to be newsworthy, you completely out-general the media in that way, and they despair.""
He added: ""You shell them, you pepper the media... you've got to pepper their positions with so many gaffes that they're confused.
""It's like a helicopter throwing out chaff, and then you steal on quietly and drop your depth charges wherever you want to drop them.""
This video can not be played
But the odds are so different now.
He's the PM, not the London mayor or a backbench MP, and his leadership has been significantly damaged in the past couple of months. 
Getting through this is not just going to be about wisecracks here and there.
There's an expectation too that the government will finally publish its plans for ""levelling up"" next week. 
The white paper has long been pencilled in for the start of February and ministers may use it to show that they are, to use a phrase beloved by Boris Johnson, ""getting on with the job"". 
His allies also find comfort in the fact that the rebels are not centrally coordinated. Ministers have confronted them with questions about what their plan really is, accusing them of ""student politics"".
The Brexiteers who worked together to bring down Theresa May had a plan to install Boris Johnson. 
They were largely bound by ideology and the notion that Mr Johnson should take over. 
The groups this time are scattered, and don't have one idea, or one candidate, to rally around. 
Yet the disparate nature of the discontent doesn't mean that the prime minister can be remotely sure he'll get safely through, because it makes it harder for anyone in the Tory Party to see what's in the undergrowth. 
It's not clear how many secret letters calling for a leadership vote have been submitted. 
One Johnson ally, Conor Burns, jokes that the Royal Mail couldn't bank on making any money if they're relying on Tory MPs sending them in. 
But if it hits the threshold of 54 and it comes to a confidence vote, the estimates of what might happen are wild. 
One of Johnson's camp suggested to reporters they might have the support of as many as 300 Tory MPs out of 359. 
Right now that seems extraordinarily optimistic. 
Another member of the government who has done the numbers calculated there could be more than 160 votes against, so he'd just scrape through. 
But some government ministers say privately they wouldn't back him, and he could even lose. 
In other words, bluntly, no-one really has a clue.  
In the last few days, Boris Johnson has tried to show that he is still the biggest beast in the political jungle. 
But the threats to him are still very real, and as one former minister says, the ""assassins are lurking in the bushes"" now.

When US football team Kansas City Chiefs won a crucial game against the Buffalo Bills with just 13 seconds left on the clock, pundits called it one of the sport's best clashes of all time.
Dejected Bills fans left the stadium devastated. 
But what happened next really softened the blow - Kansas fans started to donate $13 each to a charity set up by the Bills' quarterback Josh Allen.
In less than a week, $300,000 has already been raised.
Allen's charity has handed the money to the stunned bosses of the children's hospital in Buffalo, New York, it supports.
At the close of the nail-biter of a game, a Twitter account belonging to a Chiefs fan urged them all to donate $13 to mark the extraordinary 13 seconds it took to win the game.
The clash on Sunday had widely been seen as a standoff between two of the greatest quarterbacks currently in the National Football League, Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs and Allen of the Bills.
Both had top performances, but in the dying seconds of regular time, Mahomes' team forced play into overtime and eventually won with the help of a favourable coin toss that led to a touchdown.
While the tough loss will hurt diehard Bills' fans for many seasons to come, the gesture from the Chiefs fans was obviously deeply appreciated.
The Oishei Children's Hospital tweeted: ""Wow we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of donations from #ChiefsKingdom.
""Thank you all! These donations help the ongoing need and ensure our team has the tools, training and programs to care for the kids.""

Official Commerce Department figures showed the economy grew at an annual rate of 6.9% in the last three months of 2021.
That was far better than analysts had expected, as consumer spending and other activity remained robust.
For the year, the US economy grew by 5.7%.

325;Why has Sue Gray's report not appeared yet?;['2022-01-27T13:12:27.000Z'];['By Iain Watson'];['boris johnson'];['truth', 'rulebreaking', 'prime', 'telling', 'minister', 'sue', 'report', 'likely', 'maintains', 'social', 'appeared', 'grays', 'told', 'warned'];"
The expectation across Whitehall is that Sue Gray's long-anticipated report would be passed to Downing Street on Wednesday.
So why hasn't it appeared, and what is it likely to find when it does?
The announcement of the Met Police investigation has inserted a spanner in the works - especially as all contentious evidence had been given to the police by the cabinet office last week. 
And there had been liaison throughout the internal inquiry.
It's understood the Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick examined the evidence at the weekend.
While the Met has not objected to the report being published - since any action they take could be limited to issuing fixed penalty notices, and not lead to a criminal trial - Downing Street has said reassurances were now being sought that none of the content would cut across police work.
I am told by Whitehall sources that Sue Gray is determined that the report she submits to Downing Street will be in a form that can allow for it to be published by No 10 in full.
What she wants to avoid are last minute redactions, or a report that focuses on the least egregious events, while leaving everything that's contentious to the police.
Sue Gray has built a formidable reputation within the civil service and will not want to be undermined by allegations of a whitewash, or a less than thorough job.
So it is perfectly possible that minor redrafting or reworking could be undertaken which achieves the twin aims of ensuring the police would have no last minute objections, while not skirting round some of the findings about more controversial gatherings in government buildings.
According to sources close to the Gray team, there has not been any political interference to adjust the content, so that is not the cause of delay.
The prime minister will certainly see the full report before it is published but will not have a veto over its content.
And there has been no attempt by civil service trade unions to delay the report or ask for retractions.
Only very senior civil servants will be named and those who will be named have already been informed.
But it's not impossible that more junior staff individually may have raised concerns that while they are not going to be identified, the information in the report might make them nonetheless too easy to identify.
Insiders also maintain that while the whole process has been a difficult one for Ms Gray, she would push back against any informal attempts by other senior civil servants to alter the tone of the report, or to dilute the findings.
According to those who know Sue Gray's track record - as the former director general in charge of propriety and ethics in Whitehall - she holds her fellow civil servants to very high standards.
From those close to the process, it would be difficult for her to conclude that Downing Street is being well run.
While she cannot recommend any action be taken against politicians, she can be very critical about the civil service leadership in Downing Street, and of the culture in the building.
She is unlikely to mince words, and her report could subsequently trigger disciplinary action against some staff.
It will almost certainly make difficult reading for senior people - including some who have so far not been mentioned prominently in public.
Of course, there is little doubt that supporters of Boris Johnson would find it convenient to blame the advisers and indeed the longer any delay, some of those supporters may go on the front foot and call for reforms in the operation.
As for the prime minister, the terms of reference which Sue Gray was given may work to his advantage.
As head of propriety and ethics, when she dealt with complaints against ministers she would form a judgment on whether the minister or the complainant was the more reliable witness.
But as she has been restricted now to establishing the facts, she will reach no such judgment.
So, for example, if the former aide Dominic Cummings told her that Boris Johnson was warned that the 20 May 2020 gathering was a rule-breaking social event and the prime minister maintains he was not, she will not form a judgment on who is most likely to be telling the truth.
Of course, if she were to have written evidence in the form of a WhatsApp or email message read by the prime minister, simply setting out the facts could be damaging for Boris Johnson.
But those close to the 'save Boris' operation aren't expecting a 'smoking gun' - instead, they say, it's more likely there will be 'contestable' claims.
While the prime minister hasn't seen the report, he will have a sense of where it is going through the interviews he and staff have given to the inquiry.
Those who expect very firm conclusions - especially where politicians are concerned - are likely to be disappointed.
And those internal and external opponents of Boris Johnson slavering at the prospect of WhatsApp messages and potentially embarrassing photographs from inside Downing Street being made public are likely to remain unsated.
Sue Gray won't be publishing all the evidence she has received, or handed to the police.
But those close to the process say it could be that some of the evidence could be incorporated verbatim into the report where it fits the narrative and perhaps provides a salient example of the prevailing culture.
Ultimately any decision on law-breaking is for the police, not for Sue Gray - so it is perfectly possible that hers will not be the final word in this political drama.

World leaders and survivors are marking Holocaust Memorial Day with remembrance services and events.
It honours the six million Jewish people murdered during the Holocaust, alongside the millions of other people killed under Nazi persecution of other groups.
The day also marks the 77th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, in what was then-Nazi-occupied Poland.
Set up in 1940, Auschwitz was initially intended to house Polish political prisoners - but it eventually became the largest of the Nazis' extermination camps, where Adolf Hitler's plan to kill all Jewish people - the ""Final Solution"" - was put in to practice.
About 1.1 million people were murdered there, mostly Jewish. 
Here are some of the memorial events that took place during this year's Holocaust Memorial Day.
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (above, centre), the Speaker of Israel's Knesset parliament, Mickey Levy, (left) and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (right) laid wreaths at the concrete steles of Berlin's Holocaust Memorial.
Flags of the European Union, Israel and Germany were flown at half-mast in Berlin.
President of the lower house of the German parliament Baerbel Bas addressed a memorial ceremony at the Bundestag, in Berlin (below).
Mr Levi also spoke at the Bundestag.
In Austria, Chancellor Karl Nehammer (below, left) and Israel's Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, (right) attended a commemoration ceremony at the Mauthausen Memorial, the site of a Nazi concentration camp.
In Belgrade, members of the Serbian army's Honor Guard joined a memorial service at the monument for victims of the Nazi concentration camp Sajmiste.
Events were also held earlier in the week.
In York Minster's Chapter House, 600 candles were laid out in the shape of the Star of David.

327;Ukraine: How big is Russia's military build-up?;['2022-01-28T00:53:45.000Z'];['By David Brown'];['russia', 'ukraine conflict', 'ukraine'];['say', 'routes', 'naval', 'buildup', 'ukraine', 'likely', 'landing', 'russian', 'troops', 'land', 'russias', 'ukrainian', 'forces', 'big', 'military'];"
Russia has moved about 100,000 troops - equipped with everything from tanks and artillery to ammunition and air power - to Ukraine's border but denies it is planning an invasion.
About 35,000 Russian personnel are permanently stationed near Ukrainian territory. 
And on Wednesday, the Russian defence ministry released pictures of military units on their way to a training site in Rostov, close to Ukraine's border. 
Some newly arrived units have travelled almost 4,000 miles, from the Russian Far East.
Most estimates put the number of Russian troops deployed around Ukraine - to the country's north, south and east - at about 100,000.
But one Ukrainian assessment, reported by CNN, says there are 106,000 ground troops and 21,000 navy and air-force personnel.
On Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The intelligence is very clear that there are 60 Russian battle groups on the borders of Ukraine,"" about a third of the total available numbers.
In addition to the regular Russian troops, there are thought to be about 15,000 Russian separatists in Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
But some Western analysts say it is not clear that Russia has assembled everything needed for a ground invasion. 
They point to the absence of fully manned mobile field hospitals in some areas.  
The arrival of medical staff, they say, could indicate readiness to attack.
Satellite images provide additional clues. 
The presence of troops can sometimes be detected by the colour of tents.  
Those occupied are heated, melting the snow on their roofs and appearing darker from above. 
Armoured vehicles can be identified by their shapes. 
And tyre tracks or mud indicate vehicles on the move. 
A Russian force of several thousand has been moved to Belarus for a joint military exercise that will reach its peak between 10 and 20 February. 
The country's leader, Alexander Lukashenko, supports Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, is less than 100 miles (150km) from the Belarus border.
And Western observers say the exercise, Allied Resolve, could provide an opportunity to rehearse a mission against Ukraine.
Images posted online claim to show military equipment, including armoured vehicles, tanks and rocket systems, travelling towards the area.
And Russia has announced the deployment of advanced Su-35 fighter planes to Belarus, along with air-defence systems, munitions and medical support.
Russia is holding worldwide naval drills, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, starting this month and running through February, involving about:
Six Russian Navy vessels, capable of landing main battle tanks, personnel and armoured vehicles, have passed through the English Channel on their way to exercises in the Mediterranean Sea.
But it is unclear whether the Black Sea and the Ukrainian coast may be their intended destination. 
Some analysts say an amphibious landing by Russian troops would be extremely difficult and the naval forces may be a ""feint"" to draw Ukrainian ground forces away from more likely routes of attack on land.

328;The scramble for cargo aircraft as shipping costs soar;['2022-01-28T00:08:44.000Z'];['By Chris Baraniuk'];['boeing', 'airbus group', 'transport', 'freight transport', 'aerospace'];['aircraft', 'market', 'soar', 'shipping', 'sent', 'value', 'costs', 'volume', 'cargo', 'terms', 'scramble', 'freight', 'air', 'roughly', 'short', 'vaccines'];"
Last summer, as the shipping supply crisis worsened, a cargo aircraft in Italy was rapidly loaded with thousands of lipsticks. They were bound for the US, on a tight deadline.
Mehir Sethi, chief executive and founder of California-based beauty brand True + Luscious, says she had relied on sea freight for years. It had always been reliable.
But to get those 15,000 lipsticks to her customers on time, her only option was to pay to send them by air.
""At great pain to myself, we had to do it for two time-sensitive shipments. These were goods that were already committed to retailers.""
The lipsticks were flown-in at a slight loss to the business, but she says it was worth it to keep the clients.
Firms have been making thousands of decisions like this in recent months. And there is no sign of let-up yet. 
""We have used a lot of air freight, which we're not excited about, but it's a necessary thing with the challenges we're all being faced with,"" explained David Bergman, chief financial officer for sportswear brand, Under Armour, on an earnings call in November.
The Eastman Chemical Company similarly reported resorting to air freight to ship specialty plastics. 
A US Census Bureau service called USA Trade Online, that tracks cargo flows in and out of the country, notes in the first 10 months of 2021, 78.9 million kg of car parts were sent by air from Asia to the US - a staggering increase from the 3 million kg shipped during the same period in 2020. 
More technology of business:
Sending goods by air has always been expensive. But now it is more expensive than ever.
Air freight costs from Asia to North America ""have hit levels I've never seen before, $15 (£11) per kg which is just insanely high,"" says Greg Knowler, senior Europe editor at IHS Markit's Journal of Commerce. 
Delays affecting sea freight are partly to blame for this but so is the huge fall in passenger flights since the start of the pandemic.
More than half of all the air freight in the world usually travels via 'belly cargo' in the holds of passenger planes. But with far less of that space available, airlines have been scrambling to convert passenger aircraft into freighters, and bring older models out of retirement.
AirBridgeCargo Airlines, a subsidiary of Russian air freight specialist, Volga-Dnepr, is boosting its fleet with an additional six aircraft, after what Alexey Zotov, commercial director, says has been a ""peak season we never had before"". 
Backlogs at airports  have ""rolled over like [a] snowball since early autumn,"" he adds.
Some carriers, such as Air Canada, have also rushed cargo aircraft into service sooner than planned - before they've even had a chance to finish their paintwork, in some cases.
Manufacturers, including Airbus, have been inundated with requests to convert former passenger aircraft to carry more cargo, just to get additional capacity into the sky. The process includes removing the passenger seats and installing larger doors. 
""We're seeing a lot of people buying these conversions, they're sold out for the next two to three years,"" says Crawford Hamilton, head of marketing for freighter marketing at Airbus.
""That's something that we were not in a position two years ago to say.""
While air freight only represents roughly 1% of the entire freight market in terms of volume, it accounts for about 35% of the value. Sometimes, expensive products such as consumer electronics and fashion goods that have a short market life are sent by air. Plus, during the pandemic, planes have carried countless loads of vaccines and personal protective equipment.
Airbus has also launched a new air-cargo service using its five-strong fleet of BelugaST aircraft, also known as flying whales thanks to their huge fuselage.
The question is whether demand for air freight will remain strong, even if the pandemic subsides. With lots of aircraft permanently converted to carry freight, and belly cargo capacity rising once again, Robert Mayer at Cranfield University questions whether there might be too much capacity in the market half a decade from now.
Yet aircraft manufacturers seem confident. Airbus expects rising demand for dedicated cargo carriers in the coming years - and it has just launched the A350F aircraft in anticipation of that.
It can carry as much cargo, in terms of volume, as a Boeing 747 but is 40% more fuel efficient. This is achieved partly through the use of lighter materials, composites and titanium in the body of the aircraft.
Boeing, too, is bullish. It forecasts that the number of air freighters will grow globally by 60% between now and 2039. If correct, manufacturers will need to build 2,400 new cargo carriers by then.
Tom Sanderson, director of product marketing at Boeing, says it may introduce a freighter variant of its latest wide-bodied passenger jet, the 777X, but it would be ""multiple years"" before it came into service.
More freight might move by air in the coming years but that could lead to an unwelcome rise in emissions unless aviation gets greener.
Both Boeing and Airbus are currently testing ""sustainable aviation fuels"", including biofuels from renewable sources that can be used on existing aircraft instead of fossil fuel-based propellants. 
Small electric planes will are also likely to become more common. DHL Express has ordered 12 fully electric aircraft from Eviation, for example. 
Besides the prohibitive cost, one thing that puts Ms Sethi off using air freight more often to fly in her beauty product is the environmental impact.
""It would definitely bother me, just the sheer increase in our carbon footprint as a company if we were to rely on air freight,"" she says.
Like many others, she is reconsidering her reliance on global supply chains. She has decided to source some of her products from suppliers closer to home, to avoid shipping problems in the future.
""Some of the orders we were placing to our Italian manufacturer will now go to our New Jersey manufacturer,"" she says.
""I just can't cut it too close any more.""

330;Bihar railways exam violence: 'We are graduates, we are hungry';['2022-01-28T09:57:30.000Z'];['Soutik Biswas'];['asia', 'employment', 'india'];['small', 'sold', 'exam', 'taking', 'bihar', 'spiced', 'railways', 'son', 'rent', 'toll', 'young', 'graduates', 'hungry', 'spoke', 'violence', 'snack'];"
""We are graduates, we are jobless, we are hungry. Don't kick us in our stomachs,"" a young man in India's eastern state of Bihar told a colleague this week.
His anguish followed three days of rioting over jobs spread over a dozen districts in one of India's most backward states. More than 10 million aspirants had signed up for 35,000 jobs with the railways, India's largest employer. 
Aspirants alleged that the hiring process was non-transparent and riddled with problems, including allowing those with higher qualifications to compete for jobs for less qualified candidates. Frustration led to anger and escalated to violence. Students allegedly stopped trains and set fire to coaches. Police fired in the air and baton-charged protesters. The railways suspended the hiring, and threatened aspirants with barring them from all railway exams in the future.
One newspaper said the protests were not merely about a lack of jobs, but the ""toll that they were taking on the young"". The protester who spoke to my colleague said he was the son of a farmer who had sold his land to get him educated. His mother would not buy medicines when she fell ill so that they had enough money to pay for his rent and private coaching classes in the city. He mocked Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remark in 2018 on how opening a small pakoda (a spiced fritter snack) kiosk also counted as a job. ""Why are you asking graduates to fry pakodas?,"" he said.
In many ways, the young man's outburst - and the violent protests - shone a harsh spotlight on India's worsening job crisis. This week's job riots in Bihar and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, many believe, should be a wake-up call for authorities - the two populous states account for a quarter of the jobless in India. 
Not that there are jobs elsewhere. India's unemployment rate crept up to nearly 8% in December, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think tank. It was more than 7% in 2020 and for most of 2021. Economists say this is way higher than anything seen in India, at least over the last three decades.
The number of active job seekers in the working age population has fallen: only 27% of people aged 15-24 are either working or looking for a job. The more educated the person is, the more likely it is they'll remain jobless and unwilling to take up low-paying and precarious informal jobs. The proportion of women, aged 15 and older, in the workforce is among the lowest in the world.
The youth - 18 to 29 years - have traditionally borne the brunt of joblessness in India. And as more of the young go to schools and colleges, the educated youth have the highest unemployment rate in India, according to Radhicka Kapoor, a labour economist. ""This is not a new problem and has been brewing for a long time,"" she told me.
India is simply not producing enough jobs - and quality jobs - for its youth. Labour surveys have shown a quarter of the youth are sitting at home doing ""unpaid family work"", essentially lending a helping hand to family members and preparing for exams. Only a third had regular jobs, but 75% of them had no written contracts and 60% were not eligible for social security.
The scramble for government jobs - in the railways, for example - also showed that young Indians preferred those steady, protected jobs over the much vaunted gig economy work, says Dr Kapoor. ""Gig economy work is precarious and volatile with no steady career path. That's not what an educated young person wants. Glamorising gig economy work as a solution is not an answer to the jobs crisis"".
In places like Bihar, the jobs crisis has been exacerbated by the growing crisis in the farms. Land holdings are small, farming is becoming unremunerative. Farming families are selling land and borrowing money to send their children to the cities to take up private coaching. Many of them are first-generation literates, aspiring for white-collar jobs in a jobs-scarce economy.
The abysmal standards of state-run schools and colleges do not inspire confidence. The skyline of Bihar's capital, Patna, is cluttered with adverts of private coaching schools that promise to help aspirants pass tests for government jobs. Now the teachers are telling their students there are no jobs in sight: six coaching school teachers have been named in police complaints for instigating the riots.
This week's largely leaderless and spontaneous riots also tell you how India's political parties are failing to grapple with the crisis of jobs. Bihar's agitating students say they took to the streets after nobody paid heed to their protests on social media. 
Studies in Indian cities have shown that lack of jobs in households leads to high levels of domestic violence. Other studies show that ""there are no grounds empirically for the commonly made claims that there is a strong, automatic causal connection from unemployment, underemployment, or low productivity employment to violence and war"" . 
But it would be wise to bear in mind that much of the civic unrest that sparked the Emergency - when then prime minister Indira Gandhi suspended civil liberties and jailed thousands of people - in 1975 began with unrest over lack of jobs and high prices. 
A survey early in the Emergency showed some 24% of young Indians between 18-24 were out of work. Some of the biggest protests in the run-up to the darkest chapter in Indian democracy then took place in Bihar.

331;Novak Djokovic: Doubts over timing of Covid test;['2022-01-28T00:47:08.000Z'];['By Jake Horton and Daniele Palumbo'];['coronavirus testing', 'reality check'];['timing', 'codes', 'mr', 'list', 'test', 'days', 'processed', 'positive', 'sample', 'doubts', 'lower', 'confirmation', 'djokovic', 'novak', 'covid'];"
BBC research has cast doubt on the timing of the positive Covid test Novak Djokovic used to enter Australia to try to compete in the Australian Open.
It was provided to exempt him from rules barring unvaccinated people. 
However, the serial number on his test on 16 December appears out of sequence with a sample of tests from Serbia over this period gathered by the BBC.
It is also higher than for his second (negative) test result from six days later.
His visa application was ultimately rejected, but not on these grounds.
These findings raise questions over what impact a later positive test result would have had on his ability to enter Australia.
Documents submitted by his lawyers to federal court in Australia included two Covid (PCR) test certificates, one with a positive result on 16 December and one with a negative result on 22 December.
A German research group called Zerforschung first picked up on the discrepancy that the earlier test had a higher confirmation code than the later one. 
They wrote a blog titled ""Novak Djokovic's time-travelling PCR tests"", and partnered with German news site Der Spiegel who reported on the issue.
Documents submitted to the federal court in Australia included one from the acting director of Serbia's official health body, confirming the dates on these certificates accurately reflected when the tests had been carried out.
Mr Djokovic was tested in Serbia, and received his results from the Institute of Public Health of Serbia.
All these test results have a unique confirmation code. 
We wanted to check whether these numbers are generated in strict chronological order in a single national database at the time of processing.
If so, it would bring into question why the earlier test had a higher serial number.
So we collected data from as many Serbian test certificates as we could to plot these confirmation codes on a timeline.
Each dot on the graph above represents a single confirmation code on a test certificate we obtained.
Of these, 21 were provided by BBC colleagues based in Serbia, all issued by the Institute of Public Health.
A further 35 were obtained from Milovan Suvakov, a Serbian research scientist based in the US, who had been posting some of his own data on Twitter.
He sent us the PDF files for all these results - some redacted to protect identities.  
The confirmation codes in all cases slotted into the same chronological timeline as our initial batch sent by BBC colleagues and showed that the earlier the test result date, the lower the confirmation code.
The only outlier of all the confirmation codes we've plotted was Mr Djokovic's positive test on 16 December.
We have tests in our sample from 16 December as well as from the days either side.
They all follow the expected pattern with confirmation numbers increasing chronologically.
If you then take the confirmation code for Mr Djokovic's positive test on 16 December (7371999), it fits on our line between the test code results we have for 25 December (7366969) and 28 December (7415312).
This would seem to suggest a test from between these two later dates.
We know that the two tests taken by Mr Djokovic were processed in different laboratories, and it's possible that these labs were issued with different batches of confirmation codes.
This might explain why his first test has a higher code than his second.
However, in our list of confirmation codes, we have two that were processed in the same lab as Mr Djokovic's positive test (two days and four days after his sample). They both have lower confirmation codes.
In addition, the test results we gathered were processed at eight different labs, and there is nothing in the data to suggest different labs have separate batches of confirmation codes.
""There is always the possibility for a glitch,"" says Djordje Krivokapic, a specialist in data and digital security.
""But if that were the case, there would be a simple explanation,"" he says. ""I don't see why the state authorities wouldn't just say that.""
We've put all our findings in this report to the Institute of Public Health of Serbia, as well as the government's Office of Information Technology. 
We've tried on multiple occasions and through various channels, but have not yet had a response. 
We also contacted Mr Djokovic's team and invited them to explain the discrepancies, but haven't heard back from them.

332;British 'hitman' found guilty of plotting to kill Pakistani activist;['2022-01-28T17:18:55.000Z'];['By Secunder Kermani'];['pakistan', 'press freedom', 'human rights', 'imran khan', 'censorship'];['plotting', 'reopen', 'services', 'officials', 'pakistani', 'activist', 'hitman', 'guilty', 'trail', 'british', 'torturing', 'lead', 'kill', 'investigations', 'suspicious', 'swedish'];"
A British ""hitman"" has been found guilty of conspiring to kill a Pakistani dissident in the Netherlands. 
A court in London heard Muhammad Gohir Khan was offered £100,000 (about $134,000) to carry out the murder in Rotterdam last year. 
However he failed to track his target down, and was arrested on his return to the UK. 
Now a jury has given a unanimous guilty verdict of conspiracy to murder and he is set be sentenced in March.
The intended victim, Waqass Goraya, has told the BBC he is sure the Pakistani intelligence services were ultimately behind the plot and that it forms part of a wider crackdown on dissenting voices both inside and outside Pakistan. 
Pakistani officials would not comment on the case. 
Gohir Khan, from east London, had racked up debts of more than £200,000 whilst running a cargo company. He was working as a delivery driver for a supermarket, but reacted enthusiastically when he was contacted about a ""job"" in Europe by a contact in Pakistan. 
Khan claimed in court that he initially did not know what the job entailed, but he used fishing analogies in a WhatsApp conversation with a middleman man named as Muzzamil who was to take 20% of the fee.  
""Is it a deep sea fish or just tuna?"" Khan asked. Muzzamil, who was also known as ""Papa"" because of his resemblance to cartoon character ""Papa Smurf"", replied, ""just tuna, but not uk tuna, european tuna"".
Their grim intent was made clear when Khan discussed needing a ""tool"" or gun for the job, whilst at another point Muzzamil wrote about the target: ""It's not a SHARK… A little fish… Little knife / hook / worm with a string is enough."" 
The man they planned on killing was Waqass Goraya, a prominent social media activist and critic of the Pakistani military and government, living in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. He was abducted and tortured whilst visiting Pakistan in January 2017 by suspected members of the intelligence services, and told the BBC he was convinced they had now attempted to have him killed in Europe. 
""They don't like being called out for enforced disappearances or their torture cells,"" he said, adding: ""It shows their cowardice. They are scared of people talking. People who are unarmed, with nothing but a pen or keyboard. They are more scared of them than the people with guns.""
Pakistan's powerful military did not respond to requests for comment, whilst the country's information minister refused to discuss the case. 
Government officials claim there is no clampdown on freedom of speech in Pakistan and the army denies interfering in politics, but human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns about a series of violent attacks in Pakistan on journalists and activists who accuse the military of manipulating the country's electoral system.  
The threat to Pakistani dissidents extends to those outside the country too. 
Ayesha Siddiqa is an academic who has written extensively about the Pakistani military. In January 2019 she received a visit and letter from police in Britain warning of ""credible information"" that her life was in danger if she travelled back to Pakistan. 
Dr Siddiqa shared the letter with the BBC, and said her own inquiries had led her to find out, ""there was a contract on my head given to some Afghan warlords to be eliminated on return to Pakistan… if the temperature was raised I could be targeted in the UK as well."" 
Like Mr Goraya, Dr Siddiqa told the BBC she believed the Pakistani intelligence services were behind the threat. 
""I have no one else to suspect.""  
Three other Pakistanis living in the UK confirmed to the BBC they had contact with the police over the possibility of them being targeted in Britain. 
One of them, Fazal Khan, is a lawyer whose 14 year-old son Sahibzada Umer Khan was amongst the victims of a massacre at a school in the northern Pakistani city of Peshawar by militants in 2014. 
Since then, he has filed numerous court petitions involving Pakistan's military authorities, most recently criticising them for their soft treatment of one notorious former militant leader, who was kept under ""house arrest"" before mysteriously escaping. 
As a result of his activism Mr Khan has faced threats from extremists and, he believes, the security services. In July 2020 Mr Khan survived an assassination attempt in Pakistan and later fled to the UK. 
Last April, British police warned him of a threat to his life, advising him to maintain a ""low profile"" and not to venture into public places. 
Mr Khan told the BBC two plainclothes officers gave him an ""emergency police number"" and said, ""you are in our system, if you feel anything abnormal then give us a call and an armoured vehicle will arrive to rescue you"". 
The officers did not specify the exact nature of the threat, but Mr Khan believes it must be linked to the Pakistani security services, describing being forced to live ""a life of fear"". 
Others elsewhere in Europe have also been warned by Western intelligence agencies, including Taha Siddiqui, a journalist who escaped an abduction attempt in Islamabad and now lives in France. 
At Kingston Crown Court, the jury heard Gohir Khan and the middleman Muzzamil discussed the possibility of further ""jobs"" after killing Mr Goraya. 
Waqass Goraya had been told in 2018 of threats to his life by the FBI. In February last year, before Gohir Khan had even travelled to the Netherlands, he was rushed out of his home in Rotterdam by Dutch intelligence agents and taken to a secure location. 
The operation targeting him at times appeared amateur and poorly organised, with Khan bemoaning delays in the process as ""dysfunctional"". Meanwhile, Khan produced fake doctored receipts and invented a fictional ""crew"" accompanying him in order to try to extract more money for the hit. 
Testifying in court, Khan, who was at times tearful, came across as a bumbling opportunist, describing for example how he crashed a car in Rotterdam within minutes of renting it as he wasn't used to driving on the right hand side of the road.   
When attempting to bypass Covid travel restrictions in order to travel to the Netherlands in June 2021, Khan asked a contact to pretend to be his brother living there. 
On arrival, however, he was questioned by a border official who called the ""brother"" on the phone and asked him how old Khan was in order to verify his identity. Unable to answer, Khan's ""brother"" hung up, and Khan was denied entry to the country. 
A few days later, Khan made the trip for a second time and was finally able to reach Rotterdam. He purchased a 19-inch knife and staked out what he believed was Mr Goraya's home. However, he soon realised the address he had been provided with was wrong. 
Muzzamil assured him that his ""boss"" had received a video of Mr Goraya at the address around six months earlier, but unable to locate him Khan returned to London. On leaving Rotterdam he was questioned by a Dutch border force officer about his trip. 
Struggling for an answer, Khan replied that he had been ""touristing"", leading the officer to refer him to police in Britain. They arrested him and eventually found his message history with Muzzamil. 
In court, Khan insisted he never planned to go ahead with the murder and simply wanted to extract money from Muzammil, telling police he only bought a knife in Rotterdam to cut bread and fruit with. The prosecution argued he fully intended to carry out the killing and the jury agreed, convicting him of conspiracy to murder. 
The Pakistan-based ""client"" who had ordered the hit was never named in court, though Muzzamil referred to a ""big boss"" who gave a green light to the operation and who he had worked with for around 20 years. 
Muzzamil's full identity has not been disclosed either, though he appears to be a British national living in Pakistan. Police officials simply said the case remains an ""active investigation"". 
Mr Goraya is urging the UK authorities to further investigate the case and all those involved. 
""It should not stop here… They have to go after the people who transferred the money, who ordered the hit."" 
He has no doubt that trail will eventually lead to the same Pakistani intelligence services he accuses of torturing him five years ago. He, along with other campaigners, also want Swedish and Canadian officials to re-open investigations into the deaths of two Baloch dissidents in 2021, both of which were found not to be suspicious. 
Some activists worry Britain's close diplomatic relationship and co-operation with the Pakistani authorities on counter-terrorism will lead them to play down the significance of the episode. 
Mr Goraya, however, is determined, not to be silenced. 
""Threats and intimidation don't work,"" he told the BBC. ""It makes people resilient. It makes their voice louder.""

333;Why Germany isn't sending weapons to Ukraine;['2022-01-28T22:01:46.000Z'];['By Jenny Hill'];['germany', 'ukraine conflict', 'ukraine'];['germany', 'strongest', 'ukraine', 'aggression', 'sending', 'isnt', 'word', 'united', 'think', 'realistic', 'weapon', 'weapons', 'states', 'turn'];"
Germany's refusal to send weapons to Ukraine has puzzled and angered some allies. But the reasons why Europe's most powerful country is standing back are historical and complex.
There's a great grassy plain to the east of Berlin where the soil tells terrible stories.
As farmers plough, their blades disturb human bones, weapons; the fragments of one of the most brutal battles of World War II.
It was spring 1945. Hitler was hiding in a bunker in Berlin, his troops in retreat. Soviet forces advanced from the east across the plain but, above them on a hill called the Seelow Heights, the Nazis had taken up a defensive position. 
It was, by all accounts, a muddy, chaotic bloodbath. The Soviets eventually prevailed, hastening the end of the war, but it's estimated up to 30,000 of their soldiers were killed.
To visit the memorial at Seelow Heights is to understand how deeply entrenched this country's history remains in the minds of many Germans - and how the horrors of the twentieth century still influence its foreign policy today.
It is one of the reasons Germany has refused to send weapons to Ukraine, prompting a furious response from politicians there.
This is, by and large, a nation of pacifists. 
An annual survey reveals that most Germans believe diplomatic negotiation is the best way to resolve conflict. German troops rarely participate in anything other than peacekeeping missions; there are few exceptions - and they were controversial - including the Balkans in the 90s and, more recently, Afghanistan.
It's also, ironically, one of the world's biggest arms exporters (though its output is dwarfed by that of the US and Russia). And it has strict controls over where weapons are sent, even if Angela Merkel's government was sometimes accused of not sticking to those rules. 
""Germany has a longstanding policy of restraint when it comes to military conflict of all sorts and weapons export is seen as fuelling conflict rather than reducing conflict,"" says Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff from the German Marshall Fund. ""This longstanding policy says that Germany does not export arms into conflict zones.""
Germany has departed from that principle, to arm Peshmerga fighters battling IS in Northern Iraq. But the situation in Ukraine is different, he says. The reason is history - the Nazi killings of millions of people in Ukraine and Russia.
""To export arms into the bloodlands that Germany helped to create, to supply one part of the bloodlands with arms… against the other part of the bloodlands… is an anathema in the German political debate.""
The situation on the Ukrainian border is testing Germany's new coalition government.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz - who probably thought Covid would be his greatest challenge - is now under pressure from his international allies to shift his country to a new, more hawkish position.
His government - a coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats - came to power at the end of last year promising a values-based foreign policy and even stricter constraints on arms exports.
Resisting calls - even from some within that government - to send weapons to Kiev, Chancellor Scholz has instead paid for a field hospital, offered to treat wounded soldiers in Germany and is sending five thousand helmets to Ukraine.
Because there's another reason for Germany's reluctance - many here simply don't believe that sending weapons will solve the crisis.
Scholz's foreign minister, Green politician Annalena Baerbock, points out that Germany is a financial donor to Ukraine and believes that is more effective than sending arms.
""I do not think it's realistic to believe such weapons exports could turn around the military imbalance. The best protection is to prevent further aggression. The strongest weapon, if you want to use that word, is that we, united as Nato members, as EU states, as the G7, make clear every new aggression will have massive consequences.""
Chancellor Scholz favours the dialogue-based approach pursued by his predecessor. Angela Merkel was instrumental, along with President Macron of France, in setting up the so-called Normandy format under which Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia aimed to establish a ceasefire in Eastern Ukraine. It's hoped that same format might work now.
Nils Schmidt, foreign affairs spokesman for the chancellor's social democrats, says ""France and Germany are mediators and I think it's not very appropriate for a mediator nation to send weapons to Ukraine, to one conflict party, because we are trying to promote a diplomatic solution.""
And Germany is well placed for such diplomacy. Chancellor Scholz may not have Mrs Merkel's clout with President Putin. But, thanks to their histories, Germany's relationship to Russia is unlike that of many other Western countries.

Thousands of German firms do business there. Many Germans - including Angela Merkel - grew up behind the Iron Curtain, learning Russian at school. Her ability to communicate regularly with Vladimir Putin when other leaders could not, was often attributed to their shared experience of life in the Communist East.
What puzzles - and angers - many around the world (and a fair few in Germany too) is why Chancellor Scholz isn't playing his most obvious card.
The two countries' economic ties are perhaps most controversially embodied in the Nordstream 2 pipeline, which, if and when it comes online, would double the amount of Russian gas coming into Europe via Germany.
Chancellor Scholz is under pressure to scrap the project by way of a sanction against Russia. That he has not yet done so is, critics argue, emblematic of Germany's self-interest. 
It's a sore topic for his government. His social democrats, who say the pipeline is a private economic project, are behind it. But his partners, the FDP, say it's political and the Greens would dearly love to let it go. 
Mr Scholz has indicated that, should Russia invade Ukraine, all options will be on the table, including the pipeline. But, in his quietly spoken way, has gone no further, prompting some to wonder whether history will judge him canny or weak and hesitant.
""It's wise to have a certain level of strategic ambiguity so that Putin cannot start calculating which price he would have to pay in case of doing this or that,"" says Nils Schmidt. ""That's why is so important to have all these options on the table.""
And, in the meantime, as Vladimir Putin tests the nerves of the West, Germany faces fundamental questions about its pacifist instincts.
Even towards the end of the Merkel era, calls were growing for Germany to take on a more substantial military role on the world stage.
And, as visitors to Seelow Heights, who imagine the screams of Katyusha rockets and the shouts of dying men, will understand, Germany knows very well what is at stake - and the cost of getting it wrong.

335;Chinese New Year: What is it and how is it celebrated?;['2022-01-28T14:21:25.000Z'];['By Wanyuan Song & Jeremy Howell'];['vietnam', 'singapore', 'chinese new year', 'china', 'mongolia', 'south korea'];['chinese', 'spring', 'festivities', 'usher', 'world', 'prosperity', 'festival', 'meant', 'luck', 'celebrated', 'old', 'known'];"
Tuesday 1 February marks the Chinese New Year 2022. 
It is the most important day in the Chinese calendar - more than one billion people will feast with relatives, watch parades and pray for good fortune in the year ahead.
The Chinese New Year (also known as the lunar new year) begins with the rising of the second new moon after the winter solstice (21 December).
This can occur on any date between 21 January and 20 February.
Also known as the Spring Festival, New Year is celebrated by Chinese communities across the world. The festivities usher out the old year and are meant to bring luck and prosperity in the new one. 
There are family banquets and outdoor spectacles featuring firecrackers, fireworks and often dancing dragons. The major celebrations are held on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. 
Millions of people will travel across China - sometimes thousands of miles - to celebrate with their families.
People decorate their houses with red for good luck and children are given money in bright red envelopes.
Celebrations last for two weeks, ending on 15 February this year with the lantern festival, which marks the full moon. 
Since the 1990s, people in China have been given a week off work for New Year. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, people nowadays spend more than 820bn yuan (£96bn) on shopping and dining during this period.
Each year is associated with one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac. 
This year is the Year of the Tiger. It is said that children born in the year ahead will be brave, competitive and strong.
In Cantonese, the main language of southern China and Hong Kong, the New Year greeting is ""Gong Hei Fat Choy"" (恭喜發財), which means ""wishing you prosperity."" In Mandarin, people say ""Xin Nian Kuai Le"" (新年快乐), which simply means ""Happy New Year"".
Chinese New Year is thought to date back to the 14th century BC, when the Shang dynasty ruled. 
Its origins are steeped in legend. One story says that a monster named Nian (""Year"") attacked villagers at the start of every year. Nian was afraid of loud noises, bright lights and the colour red. People used these things to chase the beast away. 
Since the dragon is a Chinese symbol of power and good fortune, many areas of the country have dragon dancing, during which a long, colourful dragon puppet is paraded through the streets, as the highlight of festivities. 
New Year is also the time when people clean their homes thoroughly to get rid of any bad luck left over from the old year.
Across East Asia, countries will also be celebrating a new year according to the same lunar calendar.
In Vietnam, the day is called Tết Nguyên Đán, or Tết, for short, meaning Festival of the First Morning of the First Day.
People clean their houses and decorate them with fresh flowers, such as peach blossoms and kumquats. The pink of the peach blossom represents energy and the kumquat represents prosperity.
In North Korea and South Korea they celebrate Seollal, which lasts for three days. Korean families serve food to ancestors in a ritual called Charye, to gain their blessings for the coming year. 
In South Korea, Spam has become a favourite New Year gift, and people will pay up to $75 (£55) for gift hampers of the tinned meat.
In Mongolia, the festival is called Tsagaan sar. Some people in Mongolia call it The White Moon festival. People worship at ovoo - stone heaps used as altars or shrines. They also exchange snuff bottles, which are thought to unite people.
New York holds a firecracker ceremony, in which some 600,000 firecrackers are exploded in Sara D Roosevelt Park. There are lion dances and parades through the streets of Chinatown afterwards.
Singapore hosts a street parade called Chingay, which features floats, colourful costumes, live performances and fireworks.
Manchester is home to one of the UK's largest and oldest Chinese communities and at New Year its 53m-long dragon is paraded through the streets towards the city's Chinatown.

A 35-year-old man has been found guilty of stalking British number one tennis player Emma Raducanu. 
Amrit Magar from Edgware was convicted at Bromley Magistrates' Court on Friday and will be sentenced at a later date.
Magar was captured on door camera footage at the 19-year-old player's south London home, where she lives with her parents, leaving notes and cards.
In a statement to the court, reported by the Daily Mail, Raducanu said she was now fearful of going out alone.
""Since all this has happened, I have felt creeped out. I feel very apprehensive if I go out, especially if I am on my own,"" she told police in a statement.
""Because of this I feel like my freedom has been taken away from me. I am constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel on edge and worried this could happen again. I don't feel safe in my own home which is where I should feel safest.""
Magar visited Raducanu's home a number of times during December last year. 
On one occasion, the former Amazon delivery driver left a hand-drawn map to show the tennis player he had walked 23 miles from his house in north-west London to reach her.
He also left her a note which read ""you deserve love"".
Raducanu, the reigning US Open champion, was named BBC Sport Personality of the Year in December.

A man in his 20s has been arrested on suspicion of rape and assault after Manchester United suspended footballer Mason Greenwood following allegations on social media.
Greater Manchester Police said it was made aware of ""social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence"".
It added ""we can confirm a man in his 20s has since been arrested on suspicion of rape and assault"".
He remains in custody.
Manchester United earlier said the player would not return to training or matches until further notice.
The club said they ""do not condone violence of any kind"" and had been made aware of the allegations on social media but would make no further comment until the ""facts have been established"".
Mason Greenwood has not responded to the social media allegations.
The 20-year-old footballer, who made his debut for the club in March 2019, signed a four-year deal in February 2021 after rising up through the ranks of the United academy.

340;True story? Lie detection systems go high-tech;['2022-01-31T00:03:00.000Z'];['By Natalie Lisbona'];['israel'];['period', 'remained', 'mouth', 'individual', 'nervous', 'detection', 'dry', 'lied', 'lie', 'hightech', 'guilty', 'theory', 'true', 'systems', 'person'];"
Prof Yael Hanein sticks a number of electrodes to the left side of my face.
""Move your eyes, blink, smile. Now try to relax,"" she says. ""We will see if you are a good or bad liar shortly.""
Prof Hanein and colleague Prof Dino Levy lead a team at Israel's Tel Aviv University that have developed a new method of lie detection.
They say they have identified two types of liars - those who involuntarily move their eyebrows when they tell a fib, and those that cannot control a very slight lip movement where their lips meet their cheeks.
Their software and its algorithm can now detect 73% of lies and they intend to improve that as they develop the system. ""When you try to conceal a lie, one of the things you try to avoid is any sort of body reaction,"" she says.
Prof Levy adds: ""But it's very, very hard for you to conceal a lie with this technology.""
Methods of lie detection have probably been around for as long as tall tales have been told. One of the first documented examples comes from 1000BC in China, where a suspect would have to fill his or her mouth with dry rice.
After a period of time the grains would be checked, and if they remained dry then the person was determined to be guilty. The theory was that if the individual had indeed lied he or she would be fearful or nervous, and therefore have a dry mouth.
The early 20th Century saw the invention of the first lie detection machines or polygraphs. The most well-known of these is the ""analogue polygraph"", which typically has three or four ink-filled needles that dance round on a strip of moving paper.
The suspect has sensors attached to their fingers, arms and body and the machine then measures breathing rate, pulse, blood pressure and perspiration as they answer a series of questions.
Yet there are continuing concerns about the accuracy of these machines and whether it is possible to fool them. So researchers and technology firms around the world are working to develop more high-tech polygraph systems.
At Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Netherlands, Dr Sebastian Speer and his team are using an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) machine to spot if someone is lying or cheating. They do this by looking out for colour changes in brain scans in response to questions.
""Essentially we see [different] areas [of the brain] that are more strongly activated [light up on the scans] when someone decides to cheat or to be honest,"" says Dr Speer.
One high-tech lie detection system already in use is EyeDetect from Utah-based firm Converus. This focuses on involuntary eye movements to detect lies.
A subject is asked to answer a number of true or false, or yes and no, questions. As they do so, eye tracking software watches and studies their responses. The result is then provided within five minutes, and it claims to be 86-88% accurate.
Converus (the world is Latin for ""with truth"") says EyeDetect is now used by more than 600 customers in 50 countries, including over 65 US law enforcement agencies and nearly 100 worldwide.
Chief executive Todd Mickelsen says the test is being utilised by authorities and firms to screen for numerous things: ""These could include prior crimes, drug use past or present, unreported disciplinary action, lying on a job application, terrorist ties.""
Meanwhile police detectives can use EyeDetect to ask specific questions regarding a crime.
It is important to stress, however, that the legality of lie detectors varies greatly from country to country,
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
In the UK, polygraphs have been used by the probation service ""in the management of people convicted of sexual offences"" since 2014. And they are now being trialled regarding domestic abuse offenders.
But the results of polygraph tests cannot be used in criminal cases in the UK's three separate legal systems - England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. 
At the same time, UK employers are allowed to offer a lie detection test to staff, but this has to be optional.
In the US, the rules differ from state to state, with the further complication of US-wide federal law on top.
For instance, California allows lie detection test evidence in state-level criminal court cases if both sides agree, yet in New York state it is not allowed under any circumstances. And US police forces cannot require that a suspect or arrested person undergoes a test.
Meanwhile, The Federal Employee Polygraph Protection Act prevents firms from putting job applications through a test.
Former CIA officer Christopher Burgess cautions that lie detectors should not be been seen as the be-all and end-all for proving the guilt or innocence of criminals - or spies.
""It's one tool used during the interrogation phase of an investigation,"" he says. ""Evidence is how liars, scoundrels, cheats and fabricators are sussed out."" 
Mr Burgess, who is now a security analyst, adds that the devices are not completely accurate, and says that he himself was once wrongly implicated by a false test result back in the mid 1990s.
As more high-tech lie detection systems enter use, he says there remain ""ethical and moral questions"".
Back at Tel Aviv University, the researchers hope that the electrodes will eventually be replaced by video cameras and software able to spot a liar from a distance or even via an internet link, based on facial muscle movements.
""In the bank, in police interrogations, at the airport or online job interviews, high-resolution cameras trained to identify movements of facial muscles will be able to tell truthful statements from lies,"" Prof Levy predicts.
After my interrogation I ask if I have passed.
""You're not a very good liar,"" the two professors jest.

341;Tigray conflict: What do we know about drone strikes in Ethiopia?;['2022-01-31T00:13:16.000Z'];['By Peter Mwai'];['drones', 'reality check', 'ethiopia'];['drone', 'used', 'know', 'bbc', 'ethiopia', 'told', 'places', 'drones', 'tigray', 'times', 'say', 'civilians', 'different', 'strikes', 'insisted', 'conflict'];"
Dozens of people have been killed in airstrikes in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray in recent months.
Some of the attacks have involved the use of armed drones, and there's growing concern about the number of civilian casualties. 
The government, which has been fighting rebels for over a year, says it has the right to use whatever arms it sees fit.
It denies that it has targeted civilians.
An air attack on a camp for internally-displaced people in Dedebit in Tigray on 8 January, killed over 50 people and left more than a hundred injured.
Images of the aftermath  - supplied to Politico by aid workers - have led open-source investigators to believe one weapon used in this incident could have been a missile fired from a Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drone.
Fragments - including wing pieces - appear to match those of a type fitted to these drones, according to researchers from the Netherlands-based Pax peace group and Amnesty International.
The presence of Turkish drones in Ethiopia was revealed in December by Wim Zwijnenburg, an investigator who works with Pax.
He highlighted satellite imagery showing Turkish drones parked at a government air base south of the Tigray region.
They can be identified by comparing the dimensions, including the wingspan and length, from satellite images.
We don't know if these particular drones were used in this incident, and the Ethiopian government has not confirmed their use.
Turkey signed a defence co-operation agreement with Ethiopia last year, although the details were not made public.
Reuters reported in December that the US had voiced its concern to the Turkish government over drone sales to Ethiopia.
An attack in early January was carried out on rebels in the Oromia region, who have made common cause with rebels in Tigray.
Few details have emerged, and it is not clear if there were casualties.
However, the air strike in the Gidami area did leave some evidence - missile fragments - which according to one investigation, suggested the use of Iranian munitions.
Satellite imagery from last December revealed the presence of an Iranian drone at Harar Meda airport, identified by its dimensions and other features.
A flight-tracking investigator has identified about 15 cargo flights from Iran to Harar Meda and Bole airports in August 2021. What they were carrying is not known.
However, last October, the US authorities publicly condemned Iran for its drone exports and named Ethiopia as one of the recipients of Iranian drone technology.
In mid-December 2021, a series of air attacks led to the deaths of 28 civilians in a market place in Alamata in southern Tigray.
The main Tigray rebel group, the TPLF, claimed government jets and drones were responsible.
Video footage was aired on a Tigrayan TV station, showing the remains of a missile said to have been used in this incident.
The missile motor tailpipe, which tends to survive impact, can be identified from the footage.
One open-source investigation - using publicly available information to try to establish exactly what happened - concluded that, based on these images, the fragments looked identical to a Chinese-made Blue Arrow 7 missile that can be mounted on a drone.
Satellite imagery revealed that Chinese-manufactured Wing Loong drones were parked at Ethiopia's Harar Meda military airbase on 15 December  - the day before the Alamata attack.
Open-source investigators believe China was the original source for Ethiopia's Wing Loong drones, initially intended for surveillance use.
Data from flight-tracking apps shows cargo shipments from Chengdu in China, home of state-owned drone manufacturer Chengdu Aircraft Industry, to Ethiopia in September and October last year.
But there's another country with both Wing Loong drones and Blue Arrow missiles which has also sent supplies to Ethiopia - the UAE.
Going by an arms database maintained by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the UAE has both Wing Loong drones, and Blue Arrow missiles.
And flight data research shows 119 cargo flights over a period of five months last year from UAE military airports to the Harar Meda air base (south-east of Addis Ababa) and Bole, the main international airport in the capital. Again, we can't be sure what these flights carried.
Ethiopian government spokesperson Legesse Tulu would not go into details about the above incidents.
He told the BBC: ""I will not say where, but the government has used them [drones] in different times and places."" He also insisted they were not used against civilians.
We don't know for certain when these drones were supplied.
The BBC contacted the governments concerned about reports that armed drones from their countries have been used in Ethiopia - but they have not responded. 
We also approached the Turkish defence company which makes the Bayraktar drone, but did not get a response.
There is no arms embargo on Ethiopia currently, and the export of armed drones is a grey area in terms of international regulation and treaties.
But their use in conflict zones around the world appears to be on the rise.
Wim Zwijnenburg, from the Pax group, believes the example of Ethiopia ""raises serious questions, considering the many allegations of violations of international law"".

342;How the high cost of living is hitting Singapore's poor;['2022-01-31T00:02:24.000Z'];['By Mariko Oi'];['singapore', 'asia', 'asia pacific', 'inflation', 'cost of living', 'food'];['price', 'singapores', 'living', 'going', 'wave', 'cost', 'understand', 'high', 'really', 'times', 'persistent', 'hitting', 'surges', 'inflation', 'poor', 'temporary'];"
In South East Asia you don't get much more of a staple food than chicken rice. Found in almost every food court and hawker centre, it is considered one of Singapore's national dishes. 
Daniel Tan, who owns six chicken rice stalls, has previously charged $2.20 (£1.60) for a small portion. But Covid has seen the cost of his ingredients rise sharply.
The price of chicken has gone up by 50% and vegetable costs have more than doubled since January 2020, he says. 
""We've been absorbing the costs for a significant period of time,"" he tells me as we meet at one of his OK Chicken Rice stalls in the north of Singapore. 
""When the pandemic hit our first thought was this was a short-term emergency - six months, maybe a year - so we held [prices] for as long as we can because we were hoping for the whole thing to be over.""
But when his electricity bills also jumped, Mr Tan decided it was time to raise prices. ""A thousand dollar electrical bill for a chicken rice store really is not sustainable,"" he says.
""If I go on any further, either my staff are not paid or I have to close down some stores and that's not what we want to do.""
Due to border closures and new employment regulations, Mr Tan has faced staff shortages and higher salaries, which all feed into rising costs for his business.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says global food prices rose 28% in 2021.
""The last time food prices were this high was in 2011, when policymakers were actually warning about a global food crisis,"" says Dr Abdul Abiad of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
These latest price rises are due to higher energy costs, which affect food and fertiliser production, with global supply chain issues compounding the problem.
Even in a wealthy nation like Singapore, it means that the number of families seeking help has increased.
""What we have seen when we make the door-to-door deliveries is that young families [with] both husband and wife working a part-time job or in the gig economy - these were the families that got impacted when Covid hit and all the part-time work dried up,"" says Nichol Ng, co-founder of Food Bank Singapore. 
It is not just the poorest 10% of the population who now need help, she says: ""It has slowly crept to maybe 20% of the population including middle income families that might not even know where to get help in the first place.""
And it is also not just higher food prices that are affecting those in need. ""Due to Covid, everybody's self-awareness about looking after themselves in terms of hygiene has increased,"" says Ms Ng.
But higher palm oil prices mean that shampoos, hand soaps and sanitisers have also become a lot more expensive.
""Up to 20% of our requests thus far, especially starting from the second half of last year, has been pivoting towards personal hygiene products,"" she adds.
Ms Ng is also concerned that the current wave of inflation does not seem to be temporary. ""In the past, at certain times of the year, you might see these price surges but it seems that this inflation is going to be persistent - and none of us really have that crystal ball to understand when it is going to end,"" she says.
Elsewhere in the region the impact of higher prices is even more severe. The latest FAO report shows more than 375 million people in Asia faced hunger in 2020, an increase of 54 million from the previous year. 
In 2020, the Global Food Banking Network saw the number of families needing help increase by more than 130% to 40m, with half of them living in Asia.
This is despite the fact that food price increases in Asia have been more muted than in the US or Europe, where inflation has soared to levels not seen in decades.
There are several reasons for this, including a good rice harvest in 2021, says the ADB's Dr Abiad. While maize prices rose 44% last year and wheat by 31% , rice prices dropped 4% . ""So rice being the main staple in many Asian economies contributed to a food price inflation being lower in the region,"" he says.
Asian nations also produce a lot of their own food, which has been sold in domestic markets rather than being exported. Governments have also been working to ensure that food supplies have been stable, says Dr Abiad.
In the Philippines, for example, liberalisation of rice imports has allowed the supply of rice to improve which has kept prices low. 
Meanwhile, China has been stockpiling various important food products, which has resulted in it bucking the trend, with the country's food prices falling in 2021. 
But it has also led to criticism that the world's second biggest economy, which accounts for 20% of global population, is hoarding supplies as it is estimated to hold 69% of the world's corn reserves, 60% of its rice and 51% of its wheat by mid-2022, according to the US Department of Agriculture. 
Singapore imports the majority of its foodstuffs, but so far big supermarket chains like NTUC FairPrice have decided not to pass on higher prices to consumers. 
To keep the prices of key products stable, the firm says it is employing various strategies including ""stockpiling of daily essentials, forward buying and diversifying our import sources to over 100 countries"".
NTUC FairPrice also has more than 2,000 own-brand products such as rice, oil, toiletries and cleaning products that it says are at least 10% cheaper than comparable popular brands.
Mr Tan of OK Chicken Rice, who also owns three mini supermarkets, says smaller retailers tend to take their cue from larger rivals when pricing goods.
""They act like a central bank to the rest of the grocery players in Singapore. The good thing about it is that inflation doesn't spike up as much during a crisis but the bad side effect is that entrepreneurship is stifled and only semi-government players can survive,"" he says.
""The question is, after the whole thing is over how many smaller players are left?"" asks Mr Tan. 
Global food prices are expected to remain high this year and the FAO's David Dawe says this is of concern for Asian governments because price hikes have not yet worked their way through the system.
""If global prices continue to rise, there will be an impact, especially for lower income families who spend bigger proportion of their income on food.""
Economists like Mr Dawe and Dr Abiad remain optimistic that Asian countries will continue to be shielded from double-digit food inflation.
But for those on the ground, like Mr Tan and Ms Ng, the issue feels more acute. They wonder whether higher prices, rather than being transitory, will linger on just as the pandemic has.

343;Gray report: Uncomfortable questions for Boris Johnson;['2022-01-31T16:00:36.000Z'];['Laura Kuenssberg'];['coronavirus lockdown measures', 'boris johnson'];['period', 'report', 'boris', 'repeatedly', 'ms', 'whats', 'johnson', 'uncomfortable', 'public', 'gray', 'went', 'office', 'wrong', 'questions', 'sacrifices', 'point'];"
Sue Gray's initial report might be short on detail. But what she makes perfectly clear is that even the bare bones of what went on in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office during lockdown were unacceptable in her view.
In Whitehall speak, to say there were ""serious failures"" in leadership is near-condemnation.
Ms Gray reveals that three new gatherings took place that weeks of reporting have not previously uncovered - and she confirms that a dozen of them are being investigated by the police.
Most risky for No 10, we can now be sure that three events the police are looking into were ones Boris Johnson himself attended.
There's an investigation, too, into what happened not just in the government buildings, which are a warren of multiple rooms, but a gathering in the private flat above the shop. 
What's also fascinating is that Ms Gray repeatedly makes the point that what went wrong matters not just because it was ill-advised in the office, but because the public were being asked to make their own sacrifices during this period.
That's why all of this has concerned so many members of the public. That's why so many Tory MPs have been angered by what went on.
By Ms Gray's counting - after interviewing more than 70 people - on 16 occasions, some of those who worked at the heart of government did not obey those rules.
Forget all the process around what and when the report would be published, the back-and-forth with the Met, the claims and denials.
This is an official verdict that Downing Street will try to move on from, but not all of the public, not all of his MPs, may be able to forgive.

Two police officers have been shot dead in western Germany during a routine traffic stop. 
At 04:20 local time (03:20 GMT) the officers stopped a vehicle in the Kusel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, a state on the French border.
A 29-year-old male officer and a 24-year-old female officer were shot dead at the scene. The latter was still a student at police academy.
Police have launched a manhunt for the perpetrators.
Roads in the area remain closed and authorities have urged people not to pick up hitchhikers, saying at least one suspect is armed. Officers have also expanded the hunt to the neighbouring state of Saarland.
Some details of the incident are unclear. As yet there is no description of the attackers, the vehicle, or the direction they fled, and police have not suggested a possible motive. 
German newspaper Bild reports that the officers sent two radio messages from the road. 
In the first, the officers reportedly said that they had stopped a suspicious vehicle and discovered dead game in the boot.
A second message followed soon after, the paper added. ""They're shooting at us!"" the officers reportedly said, before radio contact broke off. 
By the time reinforcements arrived the female officer was already dead, local media report. Her colleague died soon after. 
Sabrina Kunz, state chairwoman of the police union, said their thoughts are with the relatives and colleagues of the dead.
""We are living through the true nightmare of all police officers,"" she said, adding she was ""stunned"" by what had happened.

346;‘I feel like me again’ - troubled Army vets are helping fix driver shortage;['2022-01-30T01:24:51.000Z'];['By Lucy Wallis'];['british armed forces', 'mental health', 'haulage'];['veterans', 'security', 'helping', 'used', 'feel', 'life', 'driver', 'structure', 'taken', 'troubled', 'army', 'shortage', 'stability', 'wanted', 'tanker', 'vets', 'fix'];"
Some UK veterans can face difficulties finding employment when returning to civilian life, but one ex-soldier wants to help them get back in the driving seat.
""Take your time, compose yourself, check your mirrors.""
Darren Wright is training a new recruit to become an HGV driver. Many of the people that sit alongside him have something in common - they are all ex-military. The 46-year-old has been running Veterans into Logistics, a not-for-profit organisation in Greater Manchester, for 19 months.
""We get veterans who are struggling to find employment,"" he says. ""We reach out to them, we put our [arms] around them and we support them into becoming HGV drivers.""
Government figures published in 2017 show that of 952,000 veterans of working age, 28,000 were unemployed. 
Darren says there is a lack of support for those who leave the armed forces without a trade or skill. Many he encounters are battling with low confidence or have mental health problems.
""They put a lot of trust in me,"" he says. ""I can talk to them and go, 'Listen mate, I've been there, I know what it's like, but trust me, let's get you trained up, let's get you a job.'""
Growing up on a council estate in north Manchester, Darren left school without any qualifications or many prospects. He joined the Army at 23 and served as a gunner and paratrooper in 21 Battery, 47 Regiment, Royal Artillery for five years. He did a tour of Afghanistan and was discharged in 2004 suffering undiagnosed post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Returning to civilian life was difficult. ""I was all over the place,"" he says ""I was taking drugs and alcohol. I was in a bad way, a really bad way at the time. My marriage broke down. I became homeless. I was sofa surfing. I didn't want to be here.""
He says his life spiralled even further out of control when he became involved in a gangland kidnapping in 2006.
""Looking back to myself then, I wasn't well. I wasn't mentally right. Obviously I wouldn't do that now, and if I would have been a normal person, I wouldn't have done it then. My life was just a mess,"" says Darren.
""I regret the kidnap and the harm that it caused him and his family and I received over 11 years.""
While in prison, Darren's PTSD was diagnosed and he received treatment, which changed his life. ""I came out like me, I wanted to live, I wanted my life,"" he says. 
He used his HGV licence, which he got in the Army, to earn an income and became a fuel tanker driver. It gave him structure, stability and financial security, as well as a purpose in life. Darren realised he wanted to do more to help other veterans after attending the funeral of a close friend who had taken his own life within a year of leaving the Army. 
He sees his work as prevention. ""Preventing someone from becoming homeless, preventing them from becoming suicidal, preventing them from ending up in prison,"" he says. ""Why should a veteran be sleeping on the street, when they can get paid to sleep in a truck?""
He says ex-military personnel make good HGV drivers because they have discipline and are trained to think on their feet. Some already have experience of driving large vehicles in the forces. With an estimated shortage of more than 100,000 qualified HGV drivers in the UK and earnings of between £35,000-£50,000, getting an HGV licence can mean a job for life.  
""The minute [Darren] handed me the sheet of how much you could earn my hands were shaking,"" says ex-soldier Daniel Birch, 35. ""I thought, 'I've never earned that much money in my life.'""
Daniel joined the Army in his early 20s. He served four years in the 1st Battalion Irish Guards, which included performing ceremonial duties outside Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace.  He also did a tour of Afghanistan, and still remembers how some of his comrades were injured by IEDs (Improvised Explosive Device). 
""It really is like what you see in a film,"" says Daniel. ""When it happened there's this moment's silence where you're taking it in, you can't believe what's gone on and the next minute you hear the screaming and you can't really put it in to words. It's a horrible scream, like a cry for help.""
Overall, his transition back to civilian life went well. ""The hardest part was finding a decent job. When I came out, the only job I could get was a healthcare assistant. I ended up in that job for three years but the wages were terrible. I was only on £11,000 a year on a zero hours contract.""
He changed jobs twice, but things began to go downhill in 2017 when his dad was diagnosed with cancer. ""That's when it started getting a bit hard mentally for me, because I was working, but then I'd be taking my dad to his treatments,"" he explains. 
Daniel's partner Louise also gave birth to their youngest son, but health problems meant the baby had to stay in hospital for the first month of his life. He was later diagnosed with Worster-Drought syndrome, a disorder that affects the muscles around the throat and mouth. The couple's eldest son was also diagnosed with cerebral palsy. 
""It just hit at once,"" says Daniel, ""so I couldn't go to work and obviously if you can't go to work, you can't stay in a job. So I lost my job.""
The couple became carers for their sons, relying on a carer's allowance. But being out of work affected his confidence. ""It knocks your pride big time,"" he says. ""I like working, earning my wage.""
Four years later, when his sons started school, Daniel wanted to return to work. His partner had heard about Veterans into Logistics, and while he finds it difficult to ask for help, Daniel decided to send them an email.

347;Xuzhou mother: Video of chained woman in hut outrages China internet;['2022-01-31T11:08:35.000Z'];['BBC News'];['china'];['innocent', 'having', 'china', 'departments', 'hut', 'mother', 'object', 'judicial', 'woman', 'outrages', 'person', 'user', 'today', 'chained', 'xuzhou', 'video', 'internet', 'wrote', 'involved'];"
A video of a Chinese mother of eight children locked up in a village hut with a chain around her neck has sparked outrage and shock in China.
The video on Douyin, which owns TikTok, was shot by a man who visits the woman, and is visibly shocked at what he sees.
After bringing her warm clothes, he asks her several questions but she is unable to answer properly.
The video has gone viral with Chinese netizens demanding authorities intervene to help her.
Many have also discussed the abuse of women and their limited rights in China's rural areas, and questioned the circumstances under which the woman in Xuzhou in eastern Jiangsu province gave birth to her eight children. 
They've asked how this escaped the notice of local authorities, given China's strict family planning restrictions.
In the video, the woman appears dazed and unable to comprehend questions from the vlogger, who asks her repeatedly if she feels cold. She's dressed in only a light layer of clothes despite the freezing winter temperatures.
Since being posted on Friday, the video has prompted fevered discussion about human trafficking in China's impoverished rural areas - despite the scant details available on this particular case.
Many netizens drew comparisons to a 2007 Chinese film Blind Mountain, which tells the story of a young woman who is kidnapped and sold into slavery.
Authorities put out a statement on Friday dismissing any speculation about abduction. They identified the woman by her last name Yang, from Feng County Huankou Township.
They said she had married her husband, identified as Mr Dong in 1998, and had been diagnosed with a mental health illness. His family had told local authorities that Ms Yang often had violent outbursts.
But the response from officials further angered netizens who criticised authorities for not addressing the issue of her detainment, the use of the chains, and her overall welfare.
That prompted a second statement from authorities on Sunday, which contained more information about the family's history. 
Officials said they were now investigating her husband.
""Dong is suspected of violating the law. The public security authorities have launched an investigation into it,"" the statement said, according to local media reports.
They added that Ms Yang was now in hospital for treatment and her children had been taken into state care. Officials said she had recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia.
However, public anger over the situation has not abated with netizens demanding local authorities take greater responsibility.
""She is a person, not an object. After having eight children over 20 years, she is only to be found today? None of the government departments and judicial bodies involved in are innocent,"" wrote one user.
Online discussion of the case has been heavily censored since it flared up on Friday. Authorities have removed many posts discussing human trafficking and censored one key topic phrase ""Xuzhou Eight Children"". 
But it has retained the topic ""Authorities Statement published re Xuzhou Feng County Woman with 8 Kids"" which saw more than 190 million views and 56,000 comments on Monday alone. Much of the discussion is critical of local officials' responses.

Police have been granted more time to question Manchester United footballer Mason Greenwood who was arrested on suspicion of rape and assault. 
The 20-year-old footballer, who made his debut for the club in March 2019, was arrested on Sunday following allegations on social media.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said he remained in custody for questioning.
Manchester United earlier said the forward would not return to training or matches until further notice.
Greenwood has not responded to the social media allegations.
GMP said: ""Detectives have been granted additional time to speak to a man in his 20s who is being held on suspicion of rape and assault of a woman.
""Inquiries are ongoing and the victim is being offered specialist support.""
The force added: ""We remind people to avoid any commentary or sharing of images that could compromise the victim's right to lifelong anonymity, or risk prejudicing a live investigation with active proceedings.""
Greenwood signed a four-year deal in February 2021 after rising through the ranks of the academy.
Manchester United said on Sunday the club ""did not condone violence of any kind"" and had been made aware of the allegations on social media but would make no further comment until the ""facts have been established"".
Greenwood apologised after being dropped by England manager Gareth Southgate for a breach of coronavirus protocols while on international duty in Iceland in September 2020.
A month later, his United manager at the time, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, defended Greenwood amid media speculation of his being late for training.

Sue Gray has blamed a ""failure of leadership"" for allowing parties to take place in Downing Street when the country was under strict lockdown.
In long-awaited findings, the senior civil servant says some events ""should not have been allowed to take place"".
Ms Gray investigated 16 separate gatherings - including three that were not previously known about.
Boris Johnson said he accepted the findings in full, as he faced questions and criticism from MPs.
In Sue Gray's findings, she confirms that the Metropolitan Police is investigating 12 events - on eight separate dates - for alleged Covid-rule breaking.
These include the 20 May 2020 ""bring your own booze"" event in the Downing Street garden, which the PM has apologised for attending, and the PM's birthday party on 19 June 2020.
And the police are also investigating a gathering on 13 November 2020 at Mr Johnson's Downing Street flat.
Asked by Labour MPs if he was at that party, Mr Johnson said he would not give a ""running commentary"" on something that was being investigated by the police.
Ms Gray says she has been ""extremely limited"" in how much she can say by the Met's inquiries, and she could not publish a ""meaningful"" report at this stage. 
But she does make pointed criticisms of the culture in Downing Street among senior civil servants and staff.
She says some of the gatherings did not observe the high standards ""expected of the entire British population at the time"", and that too little thought was given to how gatherings might appear to the public.
She wrote: ""There were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times. 
""Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.""
This video can not be played
She adds that the ""excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace at any time"", likely to be a reference to reports of drunken behaviour in the Number 10 garden and staff filling a suitcase with bottles of wine, and recommends a ""robust"" policy on alcohol consumption.
The report is crucial to Mr Johnson's premiership, which has been rocked by weeks of damaging headlines about parties in Downing Street and other government buildings.
Many Conservative MPs had said they were waiting for its findings to decide whether to try to oust him from office.
At least 54 of them can set up a vote on his position if they submit letters of no confidence to a backbench committee representing Tory MPs.
In his Commons statement, the PM vowed to learn from Sue Gray's initial findings, saying he ""gets it"" and ""will fix it"".
""I am sorry for the things we simply didn't get right and also sorry for the way this matter has been handled,"" he said, as he promised a shake-up of the way Downing Street is run.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the British people believe Mr Johnson should ""do the decent thing and resign"" but he is ""a man without shame"". 
The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford was ordered to leave the Commons chamber after accusing the prime minister of lying to MPs about the events.
This video can not be played
The PM said he would create an Office of The Prime Minister, carry out a review of the civil service code of conduct and bring in measures to improve the way government works.
He is due to address a meeting of all Conservative MPs after his Commons statement, as he seeks to rally their support.
He faced repeated opposition calls to resign after his statement, and to publish the Gray report in full. 
Some Tory MPs backed the PM, but others joined in with criticisms.
His predecessor as prime minister and Tory leader, Theresa May, said: ""The Covid regulations imposed significant restrictions on the freedoms of members of the public. 
""They had a right to expect their prime minister to have read the rules, to understand the meaning of the rules and indeed those around him to have done so too and to set an example in following those rules.""
Former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell told MPs that the prime minister no longer had his support.
Aaron Bell - reported to be among backbench Tory MPs to be calling for a no confidence vote - asked Mr Johnson ""does the PM think I am a fool?"" for following strict Covid restrictions at his grandmother's funeral. 
Ms Gray was forced to rewrite her report after the Met Police asked for only ""minimal reference"" to be made to events they are looking at, in order to ""avoid any prejudice to our investigation"".
The leading investigator, Commander Catherine Roper, said Met police have been handed ""well over"" 500 pieces of paper, and more than 300 photographs so far. 
They expect to approach in writing, or via email, individuals ""identified as having potentially breached"", added Ms Roper. 
Downing Street said in a statement that the PM would ""ask Sue Gray to update her work in light of what is found"" by the Metropolitan Police, when they have finished their inquiries.
""He will publish that update,"" added a Downing Street spokesperson.

Former Prime Minister Theresa May has led Tory MPs' criticism of Boris Johnson over Downing Street parties, asking whether he had ""read the rules"".
Following the publication of Sue Gray's report on gatherings under Covid restrictions, she said her successor had to ""set an example"".
And fellow ex-cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell said said he had lost confidence in Mr Johnson.
But other Tory MPs rallied round the PM in a stormy House of Commons.
Mr Johnson is due to address the Conservative Parliamentary Party in a meeting shortly.
Senior civil servant Ms Gray's report said that police were investigating 12 gatherings over alleged Covid rule-breaking and criticised a ""failure of leadership"" within Downing Street.
After the document - restricted in scope so as not to deal in detail with allegations under investigation by the Metropolitan Police - was published, Mr Johnson gave a statement to the Commons.
He accepted Ms Gray's findings in full, promised to fix the culture within Downing Street and review the Civil Service's code of conduct.
But Mrs May, prime minister from 2016 to 2019, stood behind Mr Johnson and told the Commons: ""What the Gray report does show is that No 10 Downing Street was not observing the regulations they had imposed on members of the public.
""So either my right honourable friend had not read the rules or didn't understand what they meant and others around him, or they didn't think the rules applied to Number 10. Which was it?""
Mr Johnson replied: ""No... that is not what the Gray report says. I suggest that she waits to see the conclusion of the inquiry.""
Mr Mitchell, a former international development secretary, said Mr Johnson had always enjoyed his ""full-throated support"" but he was now ""deeply concerned"".
""When he kindly invited me to see him 10 days ago, I told him that I thought he should think very carefully about what was now in the best interests of our country and of the Conservative Party, and I have to tell him he no longer enjoys my support,"" he said. 
Another Tory MP, Aaron Bell, said he had attended his grandmother's funeral during the first lockdown, adding: ""I didn't hug my siblings. I didn't hug my parents. I gave the eulogy and then afterwards I didn't even go to her house for cup of tea. I drove back three hours from Kent to Staffordshire. Does the prime minister think I'm a fool?""
Mr Johnson said he was ""very, very sorry for misjudgements that may have been made by me or anybody else in Number 10 and the Cabinet Office"" over gatherings during Covid restrictions.
Former Conservative chief whip Mark Harper called for Ms Gray's full report - rather than the version put out after the Met asked it to be restricted - to be released.
And backbench MP Tobias Ellwood tweeted that ""if the PM fails to publish the report in full, then he will no longer have my support"".
However, many other Conservatives defended the prime minister following his statement.
Veteran MP Sir Bernard Jenkin said he commended his ""determination to restore cabinet government and it is on results over the next few months on which he will be judged"".
Former justice secretary Robert Buckland added: ""I heard today a proper acknowledgement that he needs to look in the mirror and I am glad to hear about reforms to the centre of government that I think are timely.""
And long-serving MP Sir Bill Cash said: ""I'd also like to draw attention to the historic achievements of this prime minister in relation to, not only delivering Brexit, in relation to delivering the vaccine rollout, and in relation to his dealings with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, and I believe that everybody should take that most firmly into account.""
One of Mr Johnson's firmest allies, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, told the BBC News Channel that those criticising Mr Johnson were ""the same people who have been calling for the prime minister to go virtually since he was elected"".
Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden tweeted: ""Have just come from the House where the PM offered a full and frank apology with a clear plan for changes at No10. Country faces big challenges as we deal with the consequences of Covid. That's where Govt focus must be and will be.""
Fifty-four Tory MPs must sign a letter declaring no confidence in the prime minister before a vote on his future - leading to a possible leadership challenge - can take place.

353;Downing Street parties: Met Police investigating 12 gatherings;['2022-01-31T19:03:03.000Z'];['BBC News'];['coronavirus lockdown measures', 'boris johnson', 'metropolitan police service', 'sue gray'];['street', 'downing', 'investigating', 'theresa', 'met', 'report', 'regulations', 'read', 'gatherings', 'understand', 'think', 'shows', '12', 'parties', 'didnt', 'rules'];"
The Met Police are investigating alleged Covid-rule breaking at 12 gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall held during the pandemic.
Boris Johnson was at three of the events and has refused to say whether he was at a fourth, in his own flat.
He said MPs must wait for the outcome of the Met's investigation, as he rejected opposition calls to resign.
He was commenting after Sue Gray published a limited report into lockdown parties in Downing Street.
The senior civil servant said there had been a ""serious failure"" to meet the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government.
She blamed ""failures of leadership and judgment"" at No 10 and the Cabinet Office.
But she added that she had been ""severely limited"" in what she could say by the Metropolitan Police's own inquiry, launched last week.
Twelve of the 16 gatherings highlighted in the Gray report - on eight separate dates - are being investigated by the Met, after Ms Gray passed details to the force.
These include:
20 May 2020 ""Bring your own booze"" party in the Downing Street garden, which the PM has apologised for attending
19 June 2020 A gathering in the Cabinet room at No 10, with Mr Johnson, to celebrate the PM's birthday
13 November 2020 A leaving party for senior aide Lee Cain
The police are also looking at an alleged party in Mr Johnson's own flat on 13 November 2020, the day that the PM's senior aide Dominic Cummings left Downing Street. 
Mr Johnson was pictured with Mr Cain, a close ally of Dominic Cummings, at his leaving do. 
Asked repeatedly by opposition MPs if he was also at the party in the No 10 flat on the same night, Mr Johnson said he would not give a ""running commentary"" on events being investigated by the police.
He said he accepted Sue Gray's findings in full and promised a shake-up of the way Downing Street is run.
Police are also investigating three events which were not previously known about.
They are:
18 June 2020 A gathering in the Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall, on the departure of a No 10 private secretary
17 December 2020 A gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of a No 10 official
14 January 2021 A gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of two No 10 private secretaries
Catherine Roper, who leads the Met's Central Specialist Crime Command, said: ""The offences under investigation, where proven, would normally result in the issuing of a fixed penalty notice.""
She said investigating officers have been handed ""well over"" 500 pieces of paper, and more than 300 photographs so far. 
They expect to approach in writing, or via email, individuals ""identified as having potentially breached"", Commander Roper added.
The Met have not given a timescale for when their investigation will be complete.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the prime minister of ""hiding behind a police investigation into criminality at his home and his office"".
""He gleefully treats what should be a mark of shame as a welcome shield,"" added Sir Keir.
Conservative former prime minister Theresa May said the Gray report shows Downing Street ""was not observing the regulations they had imposed on members of the public"" , so either Mr Johnson ""had not read the rules or didn't understand what they meant and others around him, or they didn't think the rules applied to Number 10. Which was it?""
Mr Johnson replied: ""No, Mr Speaker that is not what the Gray report says, I suggest that she waits to see the conclusion of the inquiry.""

356;Why cows may be hiding something but AI can spot it;['2022-02-01T00:01:25.000Z'];['By Chris Baraniuk'];['rspca', 'agriculture', 'artificial intelligence', 'dairy farming'];['team', 'oikonomou', 'ai', 'scores', 'peerreviewed', 'hiding', 'terms', 'prof', 'experts', 'cows', 'spot', 'technology', 'roughly', 'research'];"
As cow number 2073 makes her way out of the milking shed and passes in front of a nearby camera, the computer identifies her and watches every step. 
She is only on screen briefly but here is a slight unevenness to her gait, which she is trying to hide. 
A human might not notice that something is wrong but the machine picks it up.
""Really, we want to completely replace any manual watching of animals when the cow sleeps, or she eats,"" says Terry Canning, co-founder and chief executive of CattleEye. 
His firm's technology automatically detects early signs of lameness in cattle. It is confined to milking sheds, for now, but is already being rolled out on dairy farms, mostly in the US and UK. About 20,000 cows are currently under the system's watch.
Farms are increasingly turning to automation for many reasons - among them, to cover labour shortages. But new tech also offers potential improvements in animal welfare and a reduction in emissions, says Mr Canning.
""We've actually calculated, that if you can reduce lameness levels by 10% on a farm, there's a saving of half a tonne of carbon per cow per year,"" he explains.
Lameness is caused by injuries or infections and can be very painful. Lame cows produce less milk and if it goes untreated it can mean that they end up being culled.
University of Liverpool researchers have studied CattleEye's system on three farms to check its accuracy. 
In research funded by the firm (which is yet to be peer-reviewed), Prof George Oikonomou and his team compared mobility scores for cattle made by two human experts with those made by CattleEye. They found that the technology was roughly 80-90% in agreement with the two experts - in terms of judging which animals were lame. 
When 84 of the cows were subsequently checked for foot problems, the researchers found the AI system had performed slightly better than a human expert in terms of selecting those that had tissue damage in their hooves among the animals it had designated as lame.
A separate study, also led by Prof Oikonomou but funded by the Welsh government's Farming Connect scheme, found the introduction of CattleEye at one Welsh dairy farm with 300 cows, saw the proportion of animals with mobility issues fall from 25.4% to 13.5% after six months.
CattleEye is just one system bringing higher levels of automated surveillance to farms. Other devices for tracking their health include Moocall sensors.
These are strapped to a cow's tail and indicate when they are about to give birth. The sensors pick up a characteristic up and down motion of the cow's tail that occurs prior to calving.
Yet, there are plenty of farms that have not yet adopted these technologies. Dr Sarah Lloyd, her husband and family, run a farm in rural Wisconsin with about 400 cows. All of the milk they produce goes for cheese production.
""The cost of the technology just can't be borne by our milk price,"" she says. Her husband Nels Nelson prefers to work ""with his sleeves rolled up"" rather than rely on machines, she adds. He's not anti-tech but the family don't see a benefit in investing in AI-based systems.
Others take a different view. Dr Jeffrey Bewley is an analytics and innovation scientist at the dairy cattle breed organisation, Holstein Association USA. He grew up on a Kentucky dairy farm and has studied the industry ""my entire life"". He has done some consulting work for farm tech firms, though not for CattleEye.
He says there are tell-tale signs of lameness in cattle that farmers will spot - cow's back might arch a little bit, her head may bob or the length of her strides will get noticeably longer or shorter. 
But lameness is something that cows naturally try to hide because they have evolved as prey animals. So, technology that helps the farmer spot the earliest subtle signs of lameness could be useful, he explains.
The animal charity RSPCA says it welcomes new technologies for monitoring cattle, as identifying lameness can be quite subjective for human observers and so such systems could make mobility scoring more accurate.
But the organisation says that since these are novel technologies and their validity is still developing ""they cannot replace regular mobility scoring using a valid, reproducible method"".
More technology of business:
AI will gradually play a bigger role on our farms - but exactly to what extent is unclear, and whether it will really improve conditions for the animals themselves?
""I've been in several bulk barns, several dairies that are shifted to robotics and the cows are just friendlier. You can walk among them and they don't seem to be excited at all,"" says Jack Britt, professor emeritus at North Carolina State University, who has consulted for various farm tech companies. 
Yet, not all interventions have to be high tech. Simply adding grooves to the concrete on which cows walk to and from the milking shed, can improve their stability and reduce their chance of becoming lame, he says.
Nonetheless, he predicts in 50 years' time 90% of the human labour on farms will be replaced by machines. 
It is not a vision shared by Dr Lloyd. While she accepts it can be challenging to find human farm workers, she would rather keep trying than turn to machines. ""I'd prefer to have more human eyes working on farms and making a living,"" she says. 
""That's important for the economic life and social life of our community.""

357;Sue Gray: No 10 pledges updated report after police inquiry finishes;['2022-02-01T04:32:33.000Z'];['BBC News'];['boris johnson', 'sue gray'];['occupant', 'mr', 'savaged', 'streets', 'updated', 'sue', 'report', 'finishes', 'leader', 'including', 'pledges', 'inquiry', 'gray', 'illadvised', 'johnsons', 'led', 'tory'];"
An updated report on lockdown parties in No 10 will be published by Sue Gray once police finish their inquiries, Downing Street has said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with Tory MPs on Monday to reassure them and promise a shake-up of how No 10 is run.
Senior civil servant Ms Gray concluded there was a ""failure of leadership"" over the 16 events she examined.
However, the full report has not been published while the police investigate alleged Covid rule breaking.
Metropolitan Police officers are looking into 12 events for alleged breaches of lockdown rules, including three the PM reportedly attended and one in his flat.
The force has confirmed it has received more than 500 pages of documents and 300 pictures as part of its investigation, adding that it expects to conduct interviews with people who have ""potentially breached"" the rules. 
Ms Gray said she had been ""extremely limited"" by the police investigation in how much she could say, so a ""meaningful"" report could not be released yet. 
In the published update that came out on Monday, she criticised the culture in Downing Street among senior civil servants and staff, arguing that some of the gatherings did not observe the high standards ""expected of the entire British population at the time"".
""There were failures of leadership and judgement by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times,"" she wrote.
""Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.""
It was only 12 pages, but there was one very damaging and difficult conclusion in the terse summary of Sue Gray's report.
It is there now in black and white for all to see - there was rule breaking at the top of government when the country was living through lockdown.
The prime minister's original claim that all the guidelines were followed seems almost farcical now.
Downing Street's early dismissals of the claims, even some of Mr Johnson's allies admit, now seem ill-advised. The Tory leader was savaged in the Commons, including by some of his own side, the disbelief and despair led by the former occupant of his address.
The publication, however, has not toppled over an overwhelming set of dominoes.
There are Conservative MPs who are incandescent. There is also a band of loyalists determined to help him stay on, almost whatever happens next.

Ms Gray had to rewrite her report after the Met asked last week for only ""minimal reference"" to be made to events they are looking at, in order to ""avoid any prejudice to our investigation"".
The events being looked at by the police force include the 20 May 2020 ""bring your own booze"" event in the Downing Street garden, which Mr Johnson has apologised for attending, as well as the PM's birthday party on 19 June 2020.
And police are also investigating a gathering on 13 November 2020 at his Downing Street flat.
Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Mr Johnson initially declined to answer whether the report would be published in full. 
However, Downing Street later confirmed the PM would ""ask Sue Gray to update her work in light of what is found"" by the police after their inquiries conclude, adding they would publish the result of this work.

Many Conservative MPs had said they were waiting for Ms Gray's full report to decide whether to try to remove the PM from office.
If at least 54 of them submit letters of no confidence to the 1922 Committee, which represents backbench Tory MPs, they can trigger a vote on his position as leader of the Conservative Party.
Mr Johnson addressed a meeting of that committee on Monday evening, after which cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said the ""mood was positive"".
Peterborough MP Paul Bristow acknowledged it had been a ""difficult day"" but said there was support for Mr Johnson.
Earlier in the Commons, some of the PM's backbenchers expressed support for Mr Johnson - but others issued stinging rebukes in light of the findings.
Former Prime Minister Theresa May asked if he had read or understood the Covid rules created by his government, or whether he ""believed they did not apply"" to No 10, while ex-cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell said the PM no longer had his support. 
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the British people believed Mr Johnson should ""do the decent thing and resign"".
The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, was ordered to leave the Commons chamber after accusing the PM of lying to MPs about the No 10 events. Under parliamentary rules, MPs are not allowed to accuse each other of lying in the Commons.
Writing in The Times, ex-Tory leader William Hague criticised the PM's Commons apology.
He wrote: ""The prime minister could have got on the front foot, advancing his position on a broader front of ensuring integrity in government.
""Yet for some reason, this very intuitive politician decided to do the minimum in responding to the report rather than go further in his apology and his proposals.""

There are 14% more tree species than previously thought, according to what researchers are calling the first ""scientifically credible"" estimate.
Of the 73,300 estimated species, the researchers predict there are 9,200 that are yet to be discovered.
But most rare species are in tropical forests, fast disappearing because of climate change and deforestation.
The study is based on a database of tens of millions of trees in more than 100,000 forest plots around the world.
The researchers used statistical techniques to predict the likely number of tree species, correcting for gaps in existing data.
The findings suggest more must be done to protect the incredible life forms needed for food, timber and medicine and to fight climate change by sucking carbon dioxide from the air.
Lead researcher Dr Peter Reich, of the University of Minnesota in St Paul, said the findings highlighted the vulnerability of global forest biodiversity.
""Our data will help us assess where biodiversity is the most threatened,"" he told BBC News. 
""This is in the tropics and subtropics of South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania and those are places where we discovered hotspots of known and unknown rare species. 
""Knowing about these hotspots, hopefully, can help prioritise future conservation efforts.""
South America - the continent with the most ""missing"" species - has about 43% of the total number, followed by:
Diverse natural forests are the most healthy and productive, important to the global economy and to nature.
The vast majority are in tropical countries where deforestation is largely driven by:
More than 140 international researchers worked on the study, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal.
Dr Yadvinder Malhi, of the University of Oxford, said tropical forests were the ""global treasure chests of biodiversity"" and significant absorbers of carbon dioxide emissions, slowing global warming. 
""This study shows that tropical forests are even more diverse in their trees than we had previously imagined,"" he said.

Boris Johnson is focused on ""saving his own skin"" rather than key issues, after findings into No 10 lockdown parties were published, Sir Keir Starmer says. 
The update delivered by Sue Gray blamed a ""failure of leadership"" for rule breaking in Downing Street.
Mr Johnson met Tory MPs on Monday to reassure them about his premiership and to promise a shake-up in No 10.
A number of MPs have said they are waiting for Ms Gray's full report to decide on the PM's leadership.
Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab defended his boss, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had ""expressed contrition for his overall responsibility"", and had a plan to fix the running of No 10.
But fellow Tory MP Andrew Mitchell told the same programme the PM was running government like a ""medieval court"", and he was doing ""great damage"" to his party. 
And former Tory leader, Sir William Hague, said Mr Johnson had ""failed to grasp the opportunity to make a fresh start"", writing in the Times that the PM ""should be worried by the reaction of his own MPs"".
Metropolitan Police officers are looking into 12 events for alleged breaches of lockdown rules, including three the PM reportedly attended and one in his flat.
Reports said his wife, Carrie Johnson, hosted the event in their Downing Street home, an event Mrs Johnson's spokesperson previously denied happened.
In her partial report, released on Monday, senior civil servant Ms Gray said she had been ""extremely limited"" by the police investigation in how much she could say, so a ""meaningful"" report could not be released yet.
She will publish an updated report on lockdown parties in No 10 once police finish their inquiries, Downing Street has said.
Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sir Keir said the Mr Johnson had become distracted by trying to save his own premiership.
He said: ""So many people are worried about issues such as their energy bills, which are going through the roof, and the prime minister is spending all of his time saving his own skin.
""We now know that he had a meeting planned with the chancellor last week to discuss energy bills, but that was cancelled because he was having meetings to save his own job.""

But Mr Raab insisted the government was ""getting on with the job"", despite the ongoing investigation. 
""[The PM] recognised that, as Sue Gray said, the standards expected in No 10 were not as they should have been,"" he told Today.
""He said he did take responsibility and he apologised, and he provided a plan of action.
""But if you look at the big judgement calls... the prime minister has got these right. This government has got a plan.""
Asked if Mr Johnson had admitted to breaking any of the rules himself, Mr Raab said: ""The prime minister has been very clear that he acted in good faith at all times.""
It was only 12 pages, but there was one very damaging and difficult conclusion in the terse summary of Sue Gray's report.
It is there now in black and white for all to see - there was rule breaking at the top of government when the country was living through lockdown.
The prime minister's original claim that all the guidelines were followed seems almost farcical now.

Speaking to Today on Tuesday, Mr Mitchell warned the issue of parties was ""a crisis that is not going to go away and is doing very great damage to the party"", saying: ""It is more corrosive in my judgement than the expenses scandal was and it will break the coalition that is the Conservative Party.""
The former government whip also criticised the PM's running of No 10, telling the BBC: ""I think the problem is that Boris [Johnson] is running a modern government like a medieval court.
""Many of us thought he would govern in the way he did when he was Mayor Of London, through being a chairman of a board, running a very good team - that is not what has happened here."" 
Fellow Tory MP Maria Miller said the PM had announced ""significant and overdue changes"" to the running of Downing Street in light of Ms Gray's report, and he had ""rightly apologised to the nation"".
But in a statement on her website, the former minister issued a warning, saying: ""People made extraordinary sacrifices throughout the pandemic, and it is crucial that anyone who broke the rules is subject to the sanctions agreed by Parliament.""   
However, a Tory councillor, Charlie Edwards, claimed there were ""much more important things to worry about"" than the parties, telling BBC Radio Lancashire: ""In the middle of an unprecedented pandemic, every single person you speak to will have broken a rule in some way.""
Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg claimed the ""mood was positive"" in the party after Mr Johnson addressed Conservative backbench MPs on Monday evening.
In that meeting, the prime minister promised he would make changes to his political operation, perhaps later this week. 
This is expected to include the departure of some back room staff, and possibly a new chief whip to replace Mark Spencer, with some limited ministerial moves, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said.
No 10 has also indicated that it will support the formation of new policy groups of backbenchers to feed views more directly into government. 
Mr Johnson also told MPs that the Australian pollster, Lynton Crosby, would be making a return to the operation. There is no detail from Downing Street on what his role will be.

362;The deadly battles that tipped Myanmar into civil war;['2022-02-01T00:40:10.000Z'];['By Soe Win, Ko Ko Aung and Nassos Stylianou'];['myanmar coup ', 'myanmar', 'asia'];['shot', 'serious', 'relented', 'protests', 'deadly', 'student', 'school', 'thwe', 'university', 'training', 'war', 'myanmar', 'tipped', 'civil', 'battles', 'pdf'];"
Myanmar is seeing increasingly deadly battles between its military and organised groups of armed civilians, new data suggests. Many of those fighting the military are young people who have put their lives on hold since the junta seized power a year ago. 
The intensity and extent of the violence - and the co-ordination of the opposition attacks - point to a change in the conflict from an uprising to a civil war.
Violence is now spread across the country, according to data from conflict monitoring group Acled (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project). Reports from the ground also suggest the fighting has become increasingly co-ordinated and has reached urban centres which have not previously seen armed resistance to the military.
Although precise death tolls are hard to verify, Acled - which bases its data on local media and other reports - has collated figures to suggest about 12,000 people have been killed in political violence since the military seized power on 1 February 2021. Clashes have grown deadlier month on month since August.
In the coup's immediate aftermath, most civilians died as security forces cracked down on nationwide demonstrations. Now, however, the rising death toll is a result of combat - as civilians have taken up arms - Acled figures show.
UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet agreed in an interview with the BBC that the conflict in Myanmar, also known as Burma, should now be termed a civil war and called on the UN Security Council to take ""stronger action"" to put pressure on the military to restore democracy. She said the international response to the crisis had ""lacked urgency"" and described the situation as ""catastrophic"", warning that the conflict now threatened regional stability.
The groups fighting government forces are known collectively as the People's Defence Force (PDF) - a loose network of civilian militia groups largely made up of young adults. 
Hera (not her real name), 18, had just finished high school when she joined anti-government protests following the coup. She has put university plans on hold to become a PDF platoon commander in central Myanmar. She says she was motivated to join the PDF after the high-profile death of student Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing who was shot during the February 2021 protests. Hera's parents were initially concerned when their daughter began a PDF combat training course, but they relented when they realised she was serious. 
""They told me: 'If you really want to do it, do it to the end. Don't give up halfway.' So I talked to my trainer and fully joined the revolution five days after the training.""
Before the coup, people like Hera had grown up enjoying a degree of democracy. They deeply resent the military takeover and are being supported and trained by other ethnically-driven militias in the border regions who have been fighting the military on and off for decades. 
The BBC used figures from Acled, the non-profit organisation, which collects data on political violence and protests around the world. It draws on news reports, publications by civil society and human rights organisations, and security updates from local and international organisations. 
While Acled does not independently verify each news report, it says its data on fatalities are continually updated as new information about events and fatality estimates become available. This is due to the difficulty in capturing all relevant events in a conflict zone where reports can often be biased or incomplete, as well as Acled's policy of recording the lowest estimates reported. 
However, it is impossible to get a fully accurate picture of events given both sides are engaging in a fierce propaganda war. Journalists' reporting is also heavily restricted. 
The BBC's Burmese Service also collected information on fatalities from clashes between Myanmar's military and the PDF from May to June 2021. This was consistent with trends in Acled's data.
The PDF is made up of people from all walks of life - farmers, housewives, doctors and engineers. They are united by a determination to overthrow military rule. 
There are units across the country, but it is significant that young people from the Bamar ethnic majority in the central plains and cities are taking the lead - joining forces with youths of other ethnicities. This is the first time in Myanmar's recent history that the armed forces have faced violent opposition from young Bamars. 
""Many [civilians] have gone into these militias or created these so-called peoples' defence forces,"" Ms Bachelet told the BBC. ""So that's why for a long time, I've been saying that, if we're not able to do something more strongly about it, it will echo so much the Syria situation.""          
Nagar, a former businessman who controls several PDF units in the Sagaing Region in central Myanmar, told the BBC that it is not an equal fight. The PDF began with only catapults, although they have since made their own muskets and bombs. The heavily armed military has aerial firepower - used frequently in recent months. It can procure weapons from countries openly supportive of the junta - including Russia and China. 
An open source investigation by Myanmar Witness - shared with the BBC - confirmed that Russian armoured vehicles were unloaded in Yangon a few weeks ago. 
But the PDF's strength is its support on the ground in local communities. What began as grassroots resistance has become more organised, daring and battle-hardened. The exiled National Unity Government (NUG) has helped set up and lead some PDF units - and keeps in touch with others more informally. 
The PDF have homed in on soft government force targets, such as police stations and poorly-staffed outposts. They have seized weapons, and have bombed junta-owned businesses including telecom towers and banks. 
Nagar says the PDF have no choice but to take on the future of the country themselves. ""I think resolving the problems at a round table no longer works today. The world is ignoring our country. So I will arm myself.""
Hera, who joined the PDF with her older sisters, says their aim is to ""root out the military dictatorship"". 
""The military has killed innocent people. They destroyed people's livelihoods, properties and possessions. And they terrorise people. I can't accept that in any way."" 
There have been several incidents of mass killings of civilians by the military, including the deaths of at least 40 men in July - and the killing of more than 35 men, women and children in December. 
The BBC has spoken to a man who survived another attack by the military - also in December - by playing dead. Six men - unable to run away when soldiers entered their village in Nagatwin in central Myanmar - were killed. Three of them were elderly and two had mental health conditions, villagers say. The man who survived says junta troops were looking for resistance fighters.

The widow of one of the dead men says her husband's body showed signs of torture. ""They killed an old man who couldn't even speak well enough to explain. I will never forget it. I cry whenever I think about it,"" she told the BBC.
The military rarely gives interviews, but in an exclusive interview with the BBC in late 2021 junta spokesman, Zaw Min Tun, described the PDF as terrorists - using the label as justification for action against them. 
""If they attack us, we have ordered [our troops] to respond. We are trying to secure the country and the regions by using appropriate force in order to achieve a reasonable level of security,"" he said.
It is difficult to estimate the exact number of fighters on either side. Officially, Myanmar's military numbers about 370,000 troops - but in reality it could be much smaller. There have been fewer recruits in recent years - and also defections since the coup. Similarly, it is difficult to get an accurate assessment of the number of people in the PDF.
In addition to the units formed by the NUG, some PDF members are being trained, sheltered and even armed by ethnic armed groups operating along the border. Some of the groups had signed ceasefires with previous governments - those ceasefires have now broken.
The PDF has now publicly apologised to ethnic militias for previously believing military propaganda that the groups had wanted to dismantle the country. The PDF is now unanimously calling for a future federal state in which everyone will have equal rights.  
A nun - who knelt in front of a police frontline in March 2021 to protect protesters in the wake of the military coup - has told the BBC that the political upheaval since the takeover has had a seismic effect on the lives of the public. 
""Children can't go to school. Education, health, social and economic and livelihood - everything has gone backward,"" says Sister Ann Rose Nu Tawng.
""Some aborted children because they couldn't provide for them due to the poor economy. Parents can't guide their children properly because of livelihood difficulties.""
But the nun says she admires the young people who have joined the fight. 
""They are brave. They don't mind [sacrificing] their own lives in working to achieve democracy, for the good of the country, to get peace and to get this country liberated [from military rule]. I praise them, I'm proud of them and I respect them.""
