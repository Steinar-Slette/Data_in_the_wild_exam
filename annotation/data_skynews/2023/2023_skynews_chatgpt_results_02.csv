0;0;2869;2869;Teachers' strike to go ahead after education secretary 'squandered the opportunity' to avoid action, union says;Monday 30 January 2023 16:14, UK;[];['strikes'];['ahead', 'union', 'planned', 'squandered', 'avoid', 'secretary', 'opportunity', 'strike', 'education', 'action', 'talks', 'neu', 'pay', 'teachers'];"Talks between the education secretary and the teaching unions have failed and the biggest teachers' strike in years will go ahead.

Last-minute talks were held by Education Secretary Gillian Keegan on Monday in a bid to resolve a teachers' pay dispute ahead of planned strikes this week.

Members of the National Education Union (NEU) in England and Wales will now walk out on Wednesday, with more industrial action planned in the following weeks.

The strike on Wednesday is expected to encompass up to half-a-million workers with teachers due to be joined by train drivers, civil servants, university lecturers, bus drivers and security guards from seven trade unions in what will be the biggest day of industrial action in over a decade.

The NEU has announced seven days of strikes in England and Wales in February and March, with the walkout on Wednesday expected to affect over 23,000 schools.

Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, joint general secretaries of the NEU, said: ""Gillian Keegan has squandered an opportunity to avoid strike action on Wednesday.

""The government has been unwilling to seriously engage with the causes of strike action.

""Real-terms pay cuts and cuts in pay relativities are leading to a recruitment and retention crisis with which the Education Secretary so far seems incapable of getting a grip.

""Training targets are routinely missed, year on year. This is having consequences for learning, with disruption every day to children's education.""

In a separate comment, Mr Courtney said: ""I regret to say that we didn't hear anything that enables us to say that the strike shouldn't go ahead on Wednesday.

""There's no offer from the secretary of state trying to bridge the gap between us.""

Meanwhile, a headteachers' union boss has described the talks with Ms Keegan as ""deeply disappointing"".

Following the meeting with the education secretary, Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""Parents will have been looking for the government to avert the planned strike on Wednesday.

""Instead, the government continues to talk around the issues rather than putting anything on the table which allows for any meaningful negotiation.

""It is deeply disappointing.""

Mr Barton added: ""We are sorry to report that there is therefore no resolution to the dispute and the strike is set to go ahead.""

The teachers' strike was confirmed shortly before British firefighters voted to carry out nationwide action in a dispute over pay.

About 88% of members of the Fire Brigades Union had voted in favour of strike action, on a 73% turnout, the union said.

Its members had rejected a 5% pay offer in November.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130163220/http://news.sky.com/story/teachers-strike-to-go-ahead-after-education-secretary-squandered-the-opportunity-to-avoid-action-union-says-12799333;1
1;1;2870;2870;Rising public support for unions despite widespread strikes, Sky News poll suggests;Monday 30 January 2023 17:00, UK;['gurpreet narwan', '@gurpreetnarwan'];['strikes'];['workers', 'sky', 'widespread', 'sector', 'support', 'unions', 'nurses', 'suggests', 'poll', 'despite', 'strike', 'action', 'public', 'pay', 'rising', 'strikes'];"Support for trade unions is rising even though strike action is bringing public services to a standstill , Sky News polling shows.

Industrial relations are at their most fractious since the 1980s, with the country having lost more than a million working days to strikes last year.

Despite this, sympathy for striking public sector workers has risen over the past couple of months.

Exclusive polling commissioned by Sky News shows that the public increasingly think that trade unions play a positive role in society.

A survey of more than 2,000 adults found that 37% support unions, up from 35% in November.

A smaller proportion - 28% - said unions play a negative role in society, down from 34% in November.

The findings suggest that the government, which is refusing to deliver inflation-matched pay rises, may not be able to rely on waning support for strike action.

Support for unions has increased as the wave of strike action has spread from the transport and communication sectors to the NHS.

Ambulance workers, nurses and doctors have all either voted for or announced intentions to ballot for strike action since the last polling.

YouGov data shows that NHS workers elicit the strongest support from the public.

As many as 43% of respondents to the survey said they strongly support strike action by nurses, while another 22% said they somewhat support it.

Only 31% said they strongly or somewhat oppose industrial action from nurses.

Like many public sector workers, nurses have experienced a decade of real-term pay cuts.

When inflation is taken into account, nurses' pay fell by 7.76% between 2011 and 2020. The most recent pay deal, announced last summer, also lagged behind inflation.

It is a similar story across the public sector, with the pay gap between the public and private sector widening.

In the three months to October, average private sector pay growth, excluding bonuses, was running at 6.9%.

The figure for the public sector was just 2.7%. Meanwhile inflation was running at close to 11%.

The Sky News poll indicates robust support for industrial action but the public is uneasy about how readily unions can go on strike.

At a time when the government is pushing through legislation that will make it harder for unions to call strikes, 33% of respondents said that they were able to take action too easily and that more restrictions should be placed upon them.

This was down slightly from 34% in November.

By comparison, 22% of respondents said that unions should be given more freedom, up from 20% in November.

Natasha Johnston, from London, is understood to have been walking a number of dogs in Gravelly Hill, Caterham, when she was attacked on 12 January.

An inquest into her death will open at Surrey Coroner's Court on Tuesday.

Eight dogs were seized at the scene and remain in police custody as forensic investigations continue.

None of the dogs are banned breeds, Surrey Police said.

A criminal investigation has been closed and no prosecutions are being brought against any individuals, the force said last week.

The woman's family have described it as an ""extremely difficult time"".

They said the ""significant level of media interest"" had caused ""additional distress"".

""We continue to appeal for our privacy to be respected during our time of grief,"" they added.

3;3;2872;2872;Laura Winham: Council failed to follow up on police concerns for vulnerable woman who lay dead in flat for years, says family;Monday 30 January 2023 17:12, UK;[];['surrey'];['dead', 'winhams', 'ms', 'vulnerable', 'lay', 'death', 'county', 'laura', 'council', 'failed', 'woman', 'winham', 'flat', 'family', 'review', 'follow', 'oraghallaigh', 'surrey'];"A 38-year-old vulnerable woman, whose body was found three years after her death, was ""abandoned and left to die"" by social and mental health services, according to her family.

Laura Winham's remains were found by her brother in her flat in Woking, Surrey, in May 2021, after she died in November 2017.

A pre-inquest review at Surrey Coroner's Court heard the county council failed to follow up on police concerns.

Kate O'Raghallaigh, representing the Winham family at the review, said Surrey police officers visited the woman's flat when she was still alive in October 2017.

She said the police reported concerns, that she had been neglecting herself and had little access to food, to Surrey County Council.

""There was a risk to Laura of malnutrition and self-neglect in October 2017 when she was observed by police,"" Ms O'Raghallaigh said.

But the council failed to follow up on these concerns, the hearing was told.

The inquest heard that the exact date of death is unknown - a calendar in Ms Winham's flat had dates crossed off until November 2017.

Her body was found in May 2021 - three-and-a-half years after her death - when Ms Winham's family said they asked police to break into her home after they grew concerned for her safety.

A cause of death has yet to be determined, which Ms O'Raghallaigh described as a ""very unusual factor in this case"".

Katie Ayers, representing the county council, said the authority accepts a care assessment for Ms Winham should have been done after the police visit.

""What Surrey County Council has accepted is that a section nine check should have been completed but it was not,"" she said.

Ms Ayers added: ""There may have been a risk in relation to malnutrition. At this stage that would seem to be speculative.""

Ms O'Raghallaigh asked assistant coroner Dr Karen Henderson to engage a forensic anthropologist to investigate whether Ms Winham's death was caused by malnutrition and establish a window of time in which she may have died.

Dr Henderson said she will provide a written decision on the matter in the coming weeks.

She scheduled another pre-inquest review for 15 March and set a provisional full hearing date for 3 April.

The review previously heard that Ms Winham was found in a ""mummified almost skeletal state"".

Mr Zelesnkyy's strong comments came as he revealed he has sent a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron as part of his campaign to keep Russian athletes out of the Paris Olympic Games.

He also referred to the ""great Olympic mistake"" which saw Berlin stage the 1936 games when the Nazis were in power.

""The Olympic movement and terrorist states definitely should not cross paths,"" he said.

Last week, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) indicated the possibility of athletes from Russia and Belarus who have not openly supported the war to compete as neutrals in Paris.

In his nightly address, Mr Zelenskyy said: ""Attempts by the International Olympic Committee to bring Russian athletes back into the Olympic Games are attempts to tell the whole world that terror is somehow acceptable.

""As if you could shut your eyes to what Russia is doing in Kherson, Kharkiv, Bakhmut and Avdiivka.""

He added Russia must not be allowed to ""use (the games) or any other sport event as propaganda for its aggression or its state chauvinism"".

Mr Zelenskyy spoke to Mr Macron last week and has continued his ""marathon of honesty"" to keep Russian athletes out of the Paris Games.

He said there could be no neutrality in sports at a time when his country's athletes fight and die in war.

Ukraine's sports minister warned on Thursday of the possibility of his country boycotting the Olympics.

""I invite Mr Bach to Bakhmut - so that he could see with his own eyes that neutrality does not exist.""

In a statement on social media regarding ""ongoing consultations"", the IOC referred to athletes competing under a ""neutral flag"" at this month's Australian Open.

""Athletes competed in the tournament as individual athletes under a neutral flag without any identification of their country,"" said the IOC.

In a daring operation, Israeli agents appear to have launched the attack from within Iran.

A US intelligence official said on Sunday that Israel was behind the attack but the Israeli military declined to comment.

Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder confirmed no US forces had been involved but also declined to comment further.

But an Israeli intelligence expert says there are signs the strike was an Israeli operation.

Israeli intelligence analyst Ronen Bergman told Sky News: ""The use of quadcopters is a very well-known stamp of Israeli intelligence and a source of concern for the Iranian regime because the short range of the drone means they were launched from inside Iran, highlighting Mossad's capabilities.""

Mr Bergman is a pre-eminent authority on Mossad and author of Rise and Kill First, the Secret History of Israel's Targeted Assassinations.

It is not clear how much damage was done by the drone attack.

Iran claims to have foiled the raid by shooting the drones down but Mr Bergman says Israel regards the operation to have been a success.

It has not been confirmed what was attacked, but footage shot by a witness in Isfahan shows a large blast at a military factory in the city.

The city is a centre of research and development for Iran's missile technology.

'Ukraine did warn you'

Israeli sources say the attack was unrelated to drone shipments to Russia.

Iran has been supplying Russia with cheap drones used to devastating effect on largely civilian targets in Ukraine.

Ukrainian government adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted: ""Explosive night in Iran, Ukraine did warn you.""

Iran has summoned Ukraine's ambassador over the tweet.

Separately the Russian foreign ministry issued a statement condemning ""any provocative actions potentially capable of provoking an uncontrolled escalation of tension in an already far from calm region"".

The attack is the first known use of force inside Iran to be carried out by Israel under its new far-right coalition government led by Benjamin Netanyahu.

But it suggests he is prepared to continue the hawkish policies of his predecessor Naftali Bennett who advocated a new ""Octopus Doctrine"" to deal with Iran.

Instead of striking at the Iranian regime's many ""tentacles"" in the region, it advocates striking at its head.

Mossad appears to have developed a significant presence inside Iran if it can carry out short range drone attacks on secret Iranian military sites with apparent impunity.

Israel has been reluctant to directly help Ukraine in a military sense, even though Russia is using weapons supplied by Israel's enemies in Iran.

Israel does not want to alienate Russia and lose Russian permission to fly military sorties over Syria.

But this latest operation will please Kyiv if it has dented Iran's missile capability.

The biggest teachers' strike in years will go ahead after unions said the education secretary ""squandered the opportunity"" to avoid action - while firefighters have voted overwhelmingly to walkout after experiencing what their union says is a 12% drop in real-terms earnings.

The latest strikes have been announced as Sky News polling suggests support for trade unions is rising, even though walkouts are bringing public services to a standstill.

The teachers' strike comes after last-minute talks were held by Education Secretary Gillian Keegan on Monday in a bid to resolve the pay dispute before planned strikes this week.

Members of the National Education Union (NEU) in England and Wales will now walk out on Wednesday, with more industrial action planned in the following weeks.

Wednesday's strike is expected to include up to half a million workers, with teachers due to be joined by train drivers, civil servants, university lecturers, bus drivers and security guards from seven trade unions in what will be the biggest day of industrial action in more than a decade.

Government 'squandered' chance to avoid strike by teachers

The NEU has announced seven days of strikes in England and Wales in February and March, with the walkout on Wednesday expected to affect over 23,000 schools.

Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, joint general secretaries of the NEU, said: ""Gillian Keegan has squandered an opportunity to avoid strike action on Wednesday.

""The government has been unwilling to seriously engage with the causes of strike action.

""Real-terms pay cuts and cuts in pay relativities are leading to a recruitment and retention crisis with which the education secretary so far seems incapable of getting a grip.

""Training targets are routinely missed, year on year. This is having consequences for learning, with disruption every day to children's education.""

Meanwhile, a headteachers' union boss has described the talks with Ms Keegan as ""deeply disappointing"".

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""Parents will have been looking for the government to avert the planned strike on Wednesday.

""Instead, the government continues to talk around the issues rather than putting anything on the table which allows for any meaningful negotiation.""

Mr Barton added: ""We are sorry to report that there is therefore no resolution to the dispute and the strike is set to go ahead.""

Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said after talks failed: ""It is hugely disappointing the NEU is continuing with strike action. These strikes will have a significant impact on children's education, especially following the disruption of the past two years, and are creating huge uncertainly for parents.

""With talks ongoing on a range of issues, including around future pay, workload, behaviour and recruitment and retention, it is clear that strikes are not being used as a last resort.

""I have been clear today that unions do not need to strike to meet with me. I also reiterated my call to union leaders to ask their members to let headteachers know if they intend to strike, helping schools to minimise the impact on children.""

Firefighters likely to strike for first time in nearly 20 years

Firefighters also overwhelmingly backed strike action, with 88% voting yes on a 73% turnout, it was announced today.

The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it has given the government and employers 10 days to to come up with an improved offer which could be put to a vote of members in an effort to avoid strikes.

The last time there was a nationwide walkout by firefighters was in 2003.

Firefighters have experienced a 12% drop in real-terms earnings since 2010, the union says, while around one in five firefighter jobs have been cut in the same period.

It comes after members rejected an offer of a 5% pay increase in November, which unions argued was below-inflation and would be felt as a real-terms cut by workers.

The FBU argued polling has previously shown there is strong public support for strike action by firefighters, with around three in five people backing action.

FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: ""This is an absolute last resort for our members. The responsibility for any disruption to services lies squarely with fire service employers and government ministers.

""Rishi Sunak's government has refused to make funding available for a decent pay offer to firefighters and control staff.

""Firefighters were among Britain's COVID heroes who kept frontline services going during the pandemic. The prime minister has badly misjudged the public mood by imposing pay cuts on key workers.""

The strike announcement comes after research by the FBU and the University of Central Lancashire found firefighters are more likely to die of cancer than the general public.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130184749/http://news.sky.com/story/firefighters-and-teachers-to-strike-over-pay-as-public-sector-walkouts-continue-12799333;1

The star, who is best known for her portrayal of Vesper Lynd in the James Bond film Casino Royale with Daniel Craig, was due to play the lead role in A Patriot, but the production was abandoned in October 2019.

Green, 42, is suing White Lantern Films and SMC Speciality Finance for the $1 million (about £808,000) fee she says is still owed, despite its cancellation.

Image: Green is best known for starring alongside Daniel Craig in the James Bond film Casino Royale

White Lantern is bringing a counterclaim against the French actress, alleging she undermined the independent film's production, made ""excessive creative and financial demands"", and had expectations that were ""incompatible"" with the film's low budget.

The producers have cited WhatsApp messages from Green in which she described one producer as a ""f****** moron"" who should be fired and another as ""evil"". She also allegedly described funders for the movie as ""a*seholes"" and some proposed crew members as ""sh*tty peasants"". The actress addressed these messages later in her evidence.

Entering the witness box at the High Court on Monday, the third day of the hearing, Green first told how making quality productions was her ""religion"" and said abandoning A Patriot would have been like abandoning her ""baby"".

In her written evidence to the court, Green said she ""fell in love"" with the film, in which she was cast as soldier Kate Jones, after reading writer and director Dan Pringle's ""brave and daring"" script.

""I believed and still do that the film had the capacity to really wake people up and help them to see that the devastation of our world would eventually trigger resource wars and massive migration,"" she said in the statement.

Green added in court: ""As I have said repeatedly, I fell deeply in love with this project - not only the role, but also the message of the film.

""I couldn't imagine abandoning the film, as it would have been like abandoning my baby. It still feels that way.""

Producers say Green had 'animosity'

Green said the script for the film was ""one of the best scripts I have ever read"" and that she was excited to play the role of a soldier, which she had never done before. She cited the film being about climate change as an issue ""dear to my heart and important"".

The actress also discussed some of her other work, telling the court: ""I don't care about the money. I live to make good films, it's my religion.""

Max Mallin, representing White Lantern, previously claimed Green had an ""animosity"" towards a vision for the film held by one of its executive producers, Jake Seal.

The barrister said that in exchanges on WhatsApp with her agent and the film's director, Green claimed Seal was planning to make a ""cheap B movie"" and described him as ""the devil"" and ""evil"".

Mr Mallin asked Green if she remembered sending a different text message, suggesting the film under Mr Seal would be a ""B-sh*tty-movie""; she said she did.

Green told the court: ""I never wanted this to be a B-movie but I realised more towards the end that it was going to happen.""

She continued: ""I had several opportunities to walk away from this project but at the time I felt like I had an armour, the strong crew members around me.

""I thought we had these strange producers but a strong crew so we could still make something good quality, but I was probably naive.""

The move from Ireland

In her witness statement, Green said her initial confidence in the film dwindled following delays and its move from Ireland to a studio outside London, and that she felt she had been ""deceived"".

Denying allegations that she was not prepared to go ahead with the film, she said: ""In the 20 years that I have been making films, I have never broken a contract or even missed one day of shooting.

""Nor have I been late or done anything but give 100% heart, body and soul to every project I have ever been involved in.""

She added: ""Why on earth would I sabotage a project that I loved and that I risked my reputation on? It makes no sense at all.""

'Nothing against peasants'

Green also apologised for ""inappropriate language"" and ""some horrible things"" expressed by her in emails and texts in August and September 2019.

She said one message was an ""emotional response"" after finding out she had been ""lied to"" about the move from Ireland.

The actress also told the High Court she has ""nothing against peasants"" when questioned about the word being used in one of her messages.

""I have nothing against peasants, I didn't want to work with a sub-standard crew,"" she said. ""I wanted to work with a high-quality crew who just wanted to be paid standard industry rates.""

A Patriot was also due to feature Game Of Thrones star Charles Dance and Twister star Helen Hunt, with Oscar winner Kathy Bates attached too at one point.

Green is due to finish giving evidence on Tuesday and a ruling on the case is expected at a later date.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130184749/http://news.sky.com/story/eva-green-gives-evidence-at-high-court-in-lawsuit-over-collapsed-film-saying-she-fell-deeply-in-love-with-the-project-12799358;5

It comes after Sky News yesterday revealed a US general privately told Mr Wallace that the UK's armed forces are no longer regarded as a top-level fighting force.

Defence sources revealed the US general said this decline in war-fighting capability needed to be reversed faster than planned in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine.

They told Sky News' defence and security editor Deborah Haynes this should include increasing the defence budget by at least £3bn a year and halting a plan to shrink the size of the army further.

Mr Wallace agreed on the need for ""urgent recapitalisation"", but said the government was already investing £34bn into the army's equipment plan between now and 2033.

""The criticism of 'it needs to happen now' is these things don't 'happen now',"" he said. ""There's no magic wand, there's no factories whirring away like car factories where you just press buttons and they come.

""There are only about two countries on the earth that can sustain almost constant production lines - that's China and the United States. Of course we can seek to buy from abroad, but then there won't be a UK defence and aerospace industry and we won't be able to necessarily give our troops the exact equipment they want, so we always have to make that balance.""

Mr Wallace also said countries across Europe were facing ""challenges"" with their supply chains, adding: ""That is what that new money is going towards and that's why it is important to send a signal to industry to say we are investing - that's what we did with the defence command paper in 2020 and we will continue to do so.""

Speaking in the Commons earlier, his defence minister James Heappey said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt understand the army is ""in urgent need of recapitalisation"" and ""there is a budget coming"".

Downing Street said the PM still believes the British Army is a ""top-level fighting force"" despite the US general's warning.

Asked about the US general's private comments on Monday, the prime minister's official spokesman said ""yes"" to Mr Sunak believing that the British Army is a top-level fighting force.

He said the government is ""ensuring our armed forces have the equipment and capability they need to meet the threats of tomorrow including through a fully funded £242bn 10-year equipment plan"".

Former secretary general of NATO, Lord Robertson, also disagreed with the US general's view.

He said: ""The fact is that the British armed forces might have been weakened recently but they are still a formidable fighting force - and I think our country can be proud of them.""

Earlier today, Conservative defence committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said people should be ""very concerned"" about the armed forces' current capabilities.

The senior Tory called on the government to reverse ""swathing cuts"" to the army because its equipment has become ""obsolete"".

He continued: ""Our army is simply too small, we have cut down by 10,000 troops.""

Mr Sunak has yet to make any meaningful pledge to expand his defence coffers, instead pursuing a ""refresh"" of a review of defence policy that is due to be published on 7 March ahead of a spring budget that will signal whether there is any new money for the military.

The crisis in defence has been a generation in the making following repeated reductions in the size of the three armed services since the end of the Cold War by successive Conservative, coalition and Labour governments to save money for peacetime priorities.

""I don't have social media, I don't do Twitter,"" he said.

""If you're very exposed and everyone knows intricate details about your personal life, it just gets a little bit harder. Some air of mystery might be a good thing with actors.""

The Irish actor's comments come as he takes to the stage in the play Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons on London's West End.

He stars alongside former Doctor Who companion Jenna Coleman in the Sam Steiner play.

The play is set against a new law that introduces a daily limit of 140 words per person - inspired by Twitter's old character limit.

The relationship between the two main characters becomes strained as they face the challenge of where in their lives to use the daily allocation of words.

""Sometimes it's a good thing that maybe they don't have enough words for the fight that they're probably about to have and other times you can see the frustration that they can't articulate exactly what they want to say,"" Turner said.

But one area of his private life he is willing to open up about is his sleepless nights as a new father.

Although police investigated and took away his gun at the time, Davison was not charged with assault in September 2020. Instead, a detective sergeant referred him to a restorative justice programme as an alternative to prosecution, and his weapon was later returned.

Davison reacted angrily when a teenager called him a ""fat c***"" and ran off, the court heard.

The 22-year-old responded with a burst of violence so extreme his blameless victim suffered injuries to his eyebrow, nose and lip.

CCTV of the incident in a Plymouth park showed Davison punching the boy at least five times, the inquest into the deaths of Davison's victims was told.

When a 15-year-old girl went to her friend's aid - as he lay on the floor not resisting the volley of blows - she was slapped by Davison.

Davison's legally held pump-action shotgun and certificate were seized by Devon and Cornwall Police following the attack but returned to him in July 2021.

In August 2021, Davison shot dead five people, including his mother Maxine, with his firearm.

The details of Davison assaulting two teenagers came out today at the inquest into the deaths of Davison's five victims.

Davison lashed out at a young boy and girl in Central Park, Plymouth, in September 2020.

Although the boy who shouted at him ran away, the inquest heard he took out his anger out on two of the teenager's friends - considering them ""guilty by association"".

Bridget Dolan KC, counsel to the inquest, said: ""The CCTV shows more than five punches to the young man, maybe between seven and nine.

""The boy was hit so hard there was a two-inch cut above his eyebrow, and bleeding to his nose, eyebrow and lip.""

The boy required superficial stitches to his eyebrow and the girl was left with no visible injuries.

Davison later handed himself into the police after a public appeal was made and CCTV images of a suspect were issued.

The parents of the boy wanted Davison charged but he was instead enrolled on the Pathfinder ""voluntary intervention programme"" - which the Devon and Cornwall Police website insists is not a ""soft option"" and can reduce reoffending.

'Shocked by the ferocity of the assault'

After being alerted by staff from the project, Davison's certificate and weapon were seized by firearms inquiry officer David Rees but later returned.

Mr Rees told the inquest: ""Having seen the CCTV last week I was quite shocked by the ferocity of the assault. I wish I had queried the decision-making process of the gatekeeper [the detective sergeant].

""I should have questioned it.""

The inquest has previously heard Davison was so angry following the incident he wanted to kill the teenagers and went home to get his shotgun.

This week, Kate will front the new awareness drive called Shaping Us, with the hope it'll revolutionise the way the UK thinks about supporting families and young children.

It's the next major step in her ongoing work to draw attention to the importance of a child's social and emotional development up to the age of five.

The princess was joined by the Prince of Wales at a pre-campaign launch event at BAFTA headquarters in central London.

Speaking at the event, she highlighted how a child's mental development ""rarely"" gets as much focus as our physical health.

She said: ""The campaign is fundamentally about shining a spotlight on the critical importance of early childhood and how it shapes the adults we become.

""During this time we lay the foundations and building blocks for life. And it is when we learn to understand ourselves, understand others and understand the world in which we live.

""This is why it is essential, to not only understand the unique importance of our earliest years, but to know what we can all do to help raise future generations of happy, healthy adults.""

For over a decade Kate has developed an interest in this area of work after hearing how issues in early childhood can often be a contributing factor to difficulties in later life including addiction and mental health.

It led to the Royal Foundation, the charitable arm of the Prince and Princess of Wales's work, setting up the Centre for Early Childhood.

Through the Shaping Us campaign, which will be a long term project, they're aiming to transform the issue from one of scientific interest to a topic that gets people talking, just as Prince William, Kate and Prince Harry worked to break down the stigma around mental health through their Heads Together campaign.

They're hoping a range of high-profile figures from the world of media, music, science and sports will help to spread the word of the campaign and reach a diverse audience.

The princess will be involved in a series of events and social media campaigns this week to try and push home the message that a child's development in those early years shouldn't just be a concern for parents but the whole of society can play a part in making sure they get the upbringing they deserve.

This campaign marks another new role for Kate after she took over as patron of the Rugby Football League and the Rugby Football Union from Prince Harry when he stood down as a working royal.

The princess is also now Colonel of the Irish Guards, a position previously held by Prince William since 2011.

The Shaping Us campaign also shows Kate continuing with work that is important to her after the recent controversy around the Royal Family sparked by the release of Prince Harry's memoir Spare.

The former business secretary was speaking in the Commons as MPs debated the proposed new law, which would see minimum service levels set for fire, ambulance and rail services for when the sectors decide to take industrial action.

The government has insisted the legislation - being tabled at a time of widespread action across the public sector - hits the right balance between the right to strike and ensuring public safety during walkouts.

But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to repeal the bill if his party comes to power, saying it is ""likely to make a bad situation worse"".

And the public is increasingly inclined to support strike action, especially in the NHS, according to exclusive polling for Sky News.

While Mr Rees-Mogg said he was a ""supporter"" of the proposed law's aims, he added ""it is a badly written bill"" - criticising a lack of detail when instead it should ""set out clearly what it is trying to achieve"".

The Conservative MP for North East Somerset said: ""This is almost so skeletal that you wonder if bits of the bones have been stolen away by wild animals and taken and buried somewhere, as if, you know, in cartoons.""

He backed Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, over her criticism of so-called Henry VIII clauses in the bill - allowing ministers to change it without the full scrutiny of Parliament - saying such measures ""should be used exceptionally"", or it was ""bad parliamentary and constitutional practice"".

And he agreed with the SNP's David Linden who questioned the need to rush the law through, saying: ""This isn't emergency legislation. This is a piece of legislation that we have been conjugating about in the Conservatives since at least our last manifesto, if not back to 2016.

""I have supported it all the way through, I have wanted this bill to come forward, I think it is the right thing to be doing, but there is no excuse for failing to do it properly.""

'Shirking responsibility'

Mr Rees-Mogg - who held cabinet positions under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, but returned to the backbenches when Rishi Sunak took charge - also warned the holes in the bill left it more open to challenges in the courts.

""If this House passes good, well-constructed legislation, it is much less susceptible to judicial review,"" he added. ""So there is a Treasury bench interest in good, well-crafted legislation... which this is not.""

Yet, despite his raft of criticism, the MP promised to back the plan and send it on to the House of Lords for further scrutiny, appealing to them to make the changes it needed.

Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell agreed with Mr Rees-Mogg's initial arguments, but claimed he was ""shirking the responsibility"" by voting it through.

""What we have seen in recent history, recent months, is actually the government withdraw a bill for further consideration until they get it right,"" he added.

""Surely that's the mechanism, otherwise we are shirking our responsibility to get this bill right.""

But Mr Rees-Mogg replied: ""I think he attributes to me more influence than I have.

The pair, aged 28 and 40, who are from the Huyton area of the city, were also held on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent, said Merseyside Police.

A 25-year-old man, from St Helens, has also been arrested and taken to a police station for questioning on suspicion of assisting an offender.

All three men have previously been detained as part of the investigation. The total number of people arrested in connection with Ms Dale's death is 15.

Ms Dale, 28, was found with a gunshot wound in the back garden of her home just after midnight on Sunday 21 August last year.

She was treated by emergency services at the scene in Old Swan and then taken to hospital but died a short time later. She is not believed to have been the intended target of the killing.

At her funeral, Ms Dale was described by her family as a ""rising star"" who ""had her whole life ahead of her"".

Before her death, she had been promoted within the environmental health department at Knowsley Council.

""None of this makes sense and our lives will never be the same again. A senseless crime that has torn a family apart,"" the family said.

The Memphis Fire Department said it had fired two emergency medical technicians and an emergency vehicle driver after an investigation found they failed to provide adequate medical care.

Mr Nichols was left in critical condition after several officers punched, kicked and hit him with a baton in Memphis, Tennessee after he was pulled over on suspicion of reckless driving on 7 January.

The 29-year-old died three days later from his injuries.

The fire department said in a statement that Robert Long and JaMicheal Sandridge failed to conduct an ""adequate patient assessment"" of Mr Nichols.

It added that the pair, alongside Lieutenant Michelle Whitaker who drove the two paramedics to the scene and remained in her vehicle after arriving, were dismissed for violating department policy.

Five Black police officers have been fired and charged with second-degree murder and other crimes over Mr Nichols' death.

The five officers chatted and milled about for several minutes as the father-of-one remained on the ground, but there were other authorities on the scene.

In bodycam footage released by Memphis Police, Mr Nichols was heard screaming ""mom, mom"" several times as he was beaten. Footage showed police officers using a stun gun, a baton and their fists as they pummelled Mr Nichols.

While police initially said Mr Nichols had been stopped for reckless driving, they later said a review of the incident could not ""substantiate"" the reckless driving claim.

Mr Nichols' death has sparked outrage in the US over police brutality and protests have taken place across a number of cities.

Ms Bulley's dog, a springer spaniel called Willow, was found loose between the river and bench.

Police said on Monday they were keeping an ""open mind"" about what happened but they do not believe Ms Bulley was attacked.

Her partner, Paul Ansell, said he spent all of Sunday searching for the mother-of-two.

Mr Ansell, an engineer, said: ""It is just perpetual hell. It is just utter disbelief.""

""We are living through this but it doesn't feel real,"" he said from the family home in Inskip, Lancashire.

""All we can say is we need to find her. She's got two little girls that need their mummy home.

Ms Bulley, also known as Nikki, and Mr Ansell have been in a relationship for 12 years.

""I got a call from the school regarding somebody who had found Willow, and Nikki's phone and the dog lead and harness on the bench,"" Mr Ansell, who then called the police, said.

""We take the kids to school and take the dog down there - either myself or Nikki - nearly every day.""

Ms Bulley is described as white, 5ft 3in, with light brown shoulder-length hair.

At the time of her disappearance she was wearing a long black gilet jacket with a hood, black jeans and olive green ankle wellington boots. Her hair was in a ponytail.

Ian Baum sued Mr Thomas in the High Court for allegedly hiding his HIV status and ""failing to take reasonable care"" not to pass the virus on.

Mr Thomas, 48, will pay £75,000 plus costs but said he has not admitted liability by settling, adding that he maintains his innocence ""in all the meritless allegations"".

Mr Baum, a former police constable who was in a relationship with the retired rugby union star between 2013 and 2016, claimed he was HIV negative when they got together, court papers said.

The documents said Mr Baum noticed the former sportsman was taking pills from bottles which had the labels ripped off them but was told they were multi-vitamins.

He claimed he found out the pills were an HIV anti-viral medication called GSK1 after searching for them on Google.

Mr Baum said he ""immediately"" went to get a rapid HIV test and was ""devastated"" and ""went into shock"" when he found out he was positive.

'Unpleasant chapter'

The court papers said: ""By transmitting HIV to the claimant, the defendant has caused him serious physical and psychological injury.

""That information, had it become publicly known, would have been extremely damaging to the defendant's public reputation as a person who had spoken out about his homosexuality and LGBTQ issues.

""Since that time the defendant has portrayed himself as a spokesperson for LGBT issues without ever revealing that he deceptively transmitted HIV to the claimant in 2014.

""The defendant knowingly lied to the claimant about his HIV status and had coerced the claimant into having unprotected sexual intercourse when he knew that by doing so he was putting the claimant at risk of contracting HIV.""

McCue Jury and Partners, the legal firm representing Mr Baum, said in a statement: ""Ian stood up for himself against the odds. Ian is looking forward to putting this unpleasant chapter of his life behind him.""

In an opposition day debate in the Commons, the party will point to the latest crime statistics from the ONS, which showed 1.1 million incidents of anti-social behaviour had been reported to the police in the year leading up to September 2022.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper will accuse the government of failing to invest in neighbourhood policing teams, saying it has ""left communities to fight crime and anti-social behaviour on their own"".

And she will call on ministers to increase local police numbers, including ringfencing a proportion of the Police Uplift Programme - the government plan to recruit 20,000 more officers by March - for neighbourhood teams.

The latest update from the Home Office shows 15,343 have been recruited so far, with two months to go to reach the target.

Home Secretary Suella Braverman has previously pledged the new officers would ""add to efforts to drive down invasive crimes like burglary and neighbourhood offences, return to common sense policing and make our communities feel safer and stronger"".

And the Home Office said £120m had been spent on initiatives such as improving street lighting and home security to cut neighbourhood crime as part of its Safer Streets Fund.

But according to Labour, 6,000 neighbourhood police officers have been cut since 2015, and the number of Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) dropped by more than 8,500 since 2010.

Meanwhile, crime figures show the overall charge rate for crime is 5.5% compared to 15.5% in 2015.

""Meanwhile, for millions of people anti-social behaviour has become part of day-to-day life, ruining lives without consequence.""

The shadow home secretary will also outline Labour's plans for government - namely a £360m package of 13,000 additional neighbourhood officers and PCSOs paid for through a ""police efficiency programme"" to increase shared services and procurement.

""Labour is the party of law and order,"" she will add. ""The next Labour government will put policing back where it belongs, at the heart of communities.""

24;24;2898;2898;UK economy to fare worse than any other country in developed world this year, IMF forecasts;Tuesday 31 January 2023 01:46, UK;['ed conway', '@edconwaysky'];['uk economy'];['worse', 'fare', 'grow', 'previously', 'developed', 'fund', 'imf', 'economy', 'world', 'country', 'forecasts', '06', 'uk', 'forecast'];"Britain's economic reputation has been dealt a further blow after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that this year the UK economy will fare worse than any other country in the developed world - including Russia.

In the latest update of its economic forecasts, the IMF said that it expected the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) to contract by 0.6% in 2023.

To add further humiliation for the chancellor and prime minister, even as Britain's outlook was downgraded, most other countries around the world saw their forecasts upgraded.

But the Fund said that while the broader global economy was doing better than expected, with inflation having peaked and investment beginning to turn around, the UK economy would face a downgrade ""reflecting tighter fiscal and monetary policies and financial conditions and still-high energy retail prices weighing on household budgets.""

The UK had previously been forecast to grow by 0.3% this year and 0.6% next year.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:49 IMF calling UK 'a dud economy'

Now, said the Fund, it should expect -0.6% this year and 0.9% growth in 2024.

The comments are especially awkward for the Treasury, which has been criticised by some for its plans to raise taxes and reduce the budget deficit in coming years, resulting in an increase in costs for businesses and households, even as they continue to battle a cost of living crisis.

Up until recently, chancellor Jeremy Hunt had contextualised the UK's relatively weak growth by pointing to the fact that the IMF's recent forecasts projected that a third of countries were facing a recession.

However, the Fund has now upgraded its growth projections for Italy and Germany, with the result that both will now grow more than the UK in 2023.

Indeed, Britain's -0.6% GDP is the worst of any economy included in its latest forecast update, including Russia - which despite facing sanctions from most of the West is projected to grow by 0.3%.

Chancellor says UK 'not immune' from pressure

Mr Hunt said of the forecast: ""The governor of the Bank of England recently said that any UK recession this year is likely to be shallower than previously predicted, however these figures confirm we are not immune to the pressures hitting nearly all advanced economies.

""Short-term challenges should not obscure our long-term prospects - the UK outperformed many forecasts last year, and if we stick to our plan to halve inflation, the UK is still predicted to grow faster than Germany and Japan over the coming years.""

The IMF said it now expected the global economy to expand by 2.9% in 2023.

Although this is down from the 3.4% in 2022, it is nonetheless 0.2 percentage points faster than the Fund previously forecast in October.

It said: ""Adverse risks have moderated since the October 2022 [World Economic Outlook].

""On the upside, a stronger boost from pent-up demand in numerous economies or a faster fall in inflation are plausible.

""On the downside, severe health outcomes in China could hold back the recovery, Russia's war in Ukraine could escalate, and tighter global financing conditions could worsen debt distress.""

After China's decision to open up its economy and ditch its zero-COVID policy, the Fund upgraded its GDP projection from 4.4% to 5.2% this year.

It said the US would grow by 1.4%, rather than its previous projection of 1%.

The UK will typically bat off even the best-informed criticism of its eroding military prowess by trotting out lines on how Britain is the biggest European defence spender in NATO and - according to some measurements - has the fifth-largest defence budget in the world.

This may, for now, be true - though it won't be for much longer if no new cash is found for the military and Germany and France overtake - but it does not equate necessarily to value for money or to credible capability.

The Ministry of Defence has a dismal track record of procuring weapons and equipment, from aircraft carriers and fast jets to boots and lightbulbs, with billions of pounds spent and - at times very little to show for it, in particular when it comes to the army's armoured vehicles.

Countless attempts have been made to improve the process, with some successes.

There are examples of the military resisting the desire to chase an exquisite, bespoke piece of kit that will cost more and take longer to make over something that is not quite as gold-plated but works and can be delivered within the desired timeframe.

Yet it still takes around nine months simply for a business case to be approved by ministers and the Treasury - let alone implemented.

It means that the around £46bn annual budget does not go as far as it should, leaving the armed forces less capable.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:13 Is the British Army up to scratch?

At the same time, since the end of the Cold War, successive governments have chosen to cut the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force and divert money into other priorities, such as health, welfare and paying down the national debt.

This has often led to already chaotic equipment programmes being delayed to save cash in the short term - only for the cost of the project to increase over the longer run, or for the whole thing to be cancelled.

It has also meant that the size and strength of the armed forces have shrunk.

Yet the UK, as a nuclear-armed power, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of the G7 and a leading state in NATO, has attempted to avoid reducing its global ambitions to project power and influence.

This worked in the initial years after 1991 as Britain's military was shrinking from a position of significant mass and firepower.

But for the past decade, the spectre of what defence experts call the ""hollow force"" - a military that lacks the manpower, weapons, training and stockpiles to be effective - has loomed large and is now a reality.

It will be a surprise to no one inside defence that a senior US general has told Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, that the British Army is no longer regarded as a tier one force and is barely tier two, alongside the likes of Germany, Italy and Belgium.

What Prime Minister Rishi Sunak needs to decide is whether he is comfortable with that, in which case he must reduce his ambitions for the UK's role in the world, including in Ukraine.

Or whether he wants to retain his country's position of relative strength, able to defend itself and its allies. In which case, he will need to spend more on defence immediately before attempting over time to secure better value for money from the expanded budget.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131015533/http://news.sky.com/story/why-spectre-of-british-military-becoming-a-hollow-force-is-now-a-reality-12799558;6

Dame Rachel de Souza said the consumption of pornography is ""widespread"" among children and highlighted harmful effects, including the belief among many young people that girls ""expect"" physical aggression in sex.

The report published on Tuesday found that 47% of young people aged between 16 and 21 believe that girls ""expect"" physical aggression in sex.

Dame Rachel warned that ""depictions of sexual coercion and aggression are commonplace"" in online pornography as she warned that the Online Safety Bill must pass through parliament as an ""urgent priority"".

The report's findings - from a survey of 1,000 young people aged between 16 and 21 in England - include:

• Most young adults (79%) aged 18 to 21 had seen pornography involving sexual violence by the age of 18

• Many young people assume that girls expect or enjoy sex involving physical aggression, such as airway restriction and slapping

• Almost half (47%) of respondents aged between 18 and 21 said they had experienced a violent sex act

• More than a third of young adults said they had sought out violent pornography involving at least one act of sexual violence

The report's also suggested that Twitter is the platform where the highest percentage of children had seen pornography (41%), followed by dedicated pornography sites (37%) and then Instagram (33%).

Dame Rachel said she was ""deeply concerned about the normalisation of sexual violence in online pornography"" and how it impacts children's understanding of sex and relationships.

She recalled an incident where she was told by a girl who had a first kiss with her 12-year-old boyfriend that he had ""strangled her"" having seen it in pornography ""and thought it normal"".

We're above the village of Battir, south of Jerusalem, on rocky land that has been farmed by generations of the same Palestinian families over decades.

They didn't create this road. It was bulldozed one evening by an Israeli settler living nearby. In the weeks that followed, he moved sheep on to the land, built a pen for them, and then dug a hole out the side of the hill.

We're with Hasan, one of the villagers who has fought to reclaim this land through Israeli courts.

""He (the settler) was just over there, and he started expanding all over this hilltop.

""He brought some kind of big containers on wheels and he created like a big camp, with electricity generators and so on, and bringing all the facilities of water tanks and stuff like that.""

Every evening, men from Battir come up here to keep watch on a rota. Within minutes of us arriving, a spotter saw the car lights and raised the alarm.

Hasan said: ""His (the settler's) claim was a grazing permit to come just to graze his sheep in the area. Then he starts saying this is the promised land of Israel and this is the land of the state of Israel, and I have the right to be here.

""But he never showed any evidence of land ownership or a contract that he got through any legal body.""

Hasan and his fellow villagers have been threatened and on one occasion had tear gas fired at them by Israeli security when they tried to stand their ground.

""There were over a hundred settlers coming all together. We were really worried that it will become like a violent reaction. The third time he came in March or in February 2022, it was the most dangerous one when he came with some support of soldiers with him.

""They start shooting tear gas on us to prevent us from even getting closer from the hilltop over there. So we learn that this is getting violent. We are not looking to lose somebody from our village or our brothers or our cousins.""



It is a story you hear regularly in the West Bank. Israeli settlement expansion is illegal under international law and opposed by the US, UK, EU and the UN. It is the source of extreme anger for many Palestinians.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has flown in at a ""pivotal moment"" as the security situation here grows ever more volatile by the day.

He met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday and will sit down with Palestinian leaders in Ramallah on Tuesday.

Although the US still talks of a two-state solution, as do other international governments, it is a non-starter right now.

Mr Netanyahu is facing international pressure to calm the tensions, whilst at the same time beholden to extreme right-wing voices in his new cabinet.

In response to recent terror attacks in Jerusalem, the government has said it wants to arm more Israeli civilians and there has already been talk of introducing the death penalty.

The future for Hasan, and other Palestinians, is concerning.

Hasan said: ""Unfortunately, this is a very dangerous situation. We are really worried about all the support that the settlers are gaining through the new government.

""We are really worried they will come and they will attack us with their weapons, and we will not be allowed to be here anymore.""

What do you want? I ask him.

""I want to live in peace. I want to live in freedom. I want freedom because freedom will get us peace and justice. Without the freedom, we will never get peace and justice in this country.

Nicola Bulley, 45, was last seen at 9.15am on Friday by a member of the public.

Her mobile phone was found on a bench near where she was last seen on a towpath by the River Wyre in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. It was still connected to a conference call when it was found.

Ms Bulley's dog, a springer spaniel called Willow, was found loose between the river and bench.

Police said on Monday they were keeping an ""open mind"" about what happened but they do not believe Ms Bulley was attacked.

Her partner, Paul Ansell, said he spent all of Sunday searching for the mother-of-two.

Mr Ansell, an engineer, said: ""It is just perpetual hell. It is just utter disbelief.""

""We are living through this but it doesn't feel real,"" he said from the family home in Inskip, Lancashire.

""All we can say is we need to find her. She's got two little girls that need their mummy home.

""We have got to get some good news now.""

Ms Bulley, also known as Nikki, and Mr Ansell have been in a relationship for 12 years.

Police indicated she dropped her children, aged nine and six, to a local primary school before walking her dog on Friday.

""I got a call from the school regarding somebody who had found Willow, and Nikki's phone and the dog lead and harness on the bench,"" Mr Ansell, who then called the police, said.

""We take the kids to school and take the dog down there - either myself or Nikki - nearly every day.""

Ms Bulley, a mortgage adviser, is originally from Chelmsford, Essex and has lived in Lancashire for 25 years. Police said she speaks with an Essex accent.

Police 'more and more concerned' for Nicola

Superintendent Sally Riley from Lancashire Police told a press conference that fears for Ms Bulley are growing as time passes.

She said: ""The police are keeping a really open mind about what could have happened but we do believe that the likelihood is that Nicola has gone missing and this is not a crime inquiry.

""We've mounted a really intensive operation to try to find Nicola. We've got a large area to search.

""People do go missing but clearly as time goes on we become more and more concerned for Nicola.

""But we're very much hoping that we will find something to try to bring her home safe and well soon.""

Ms Bulley is described as white, 5ft 3in, with light brown shoulder-length hair.

At the time of her disappearance she was wearing a long black gilet jacket with a hood, black jeans and olive green ankle wellington boots. Her hair was in a ponytail.

Searches have been carried out by Lancashire Police - using a helicopter, drones and dogs - with support from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, Bowland Pennine Mountain Rescue team and the North West Underwater Search Team.

Footage of German riot police in Lutzerath clashing with protesters against the nearby Garzweiler coal mine made headlines worldwide.

It was a decision some found incongruous with Germany's ambition to be a global climate leader.

Jennifer Morgan, state secretary and special envoy for international climate action, said: ""These are the very challenging societal debates that one has to have if you're serious about moving forward on the climate crisis.

""Are there tough choices and painful choices that come along the way? Absolutely.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:55 14 January: Protests to save German village

Ms Morgan pointed to the other ways Germany had scrambled to ensure the lights stayed on as Russian President Vladimir Putin squeezed Europe's gas supplies.

This included phasing out all Russian fossil fuels imports ""in a very short period of time,"" shifting to 80% renewables by 2030 and helping cut energy use by 60% in industry and 14% by households, she said.

Ms Morgan added: ""I would hope that one sees that as the direction that Germany is moving in, that there are very difficult political compromises that get made,"" she said, referencing the fact the coal-intensive North Rhine-Westphalia region had also brought forward its coal end date.

But she admitted Germany was ""vulnerable"" to the recent energy security crisis and that it had ""learned the hard way that one shouldn't be so dependent on fossil fuels or on one country"".

The campaigner-turned-diplomat, who was once head of Greenpeace International, also hinted at some sympathy with the Lutzerath activists.

She called it ""incredibly important in a climate crisis"" that young people can engage ""in an act of political debate about their future"".

'Rebalance fossil fuel interests'

In an interview in the German ambassador's residence in London, Ms Morgan said ""there needs to be a rebalancing"" of fossil fuel influence at the annual United Nations COP climate summits.

Last week, 450 green groups wrote to the UN to request a crackdown, after 630 lobbyists registered to attend COP27 in Egypt last year.

Their concerns were amplified after United Arab Emirates, one of the world's largest oil producers and host of COP28 this December, appointed an oil executive and government to run the talks.

Ms Morgan said the world must ""respect who the country has put forward"" and that Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, like any COP president, would have to ""take on a role that is actually above what they currently do in their day jobs"".

Campaigners have called for Mr Al Jaber to resign from his role as head of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation, but Ms Morgan declined to say whether she would raise this with him when she meets him in February.

Asked if Germany, a long time sceptic of nuclear power, should reconsider the clean energy form, she said: ""Definitely not"".

""Nuclear has massive risks on its own, it's extremely expensive and it takes a long time to build,"" she added.

Ms Morgan, who was in London for talks with government ministers Lord Zac Goldsmith and Graham Stewart, said it would be ""safer"" for the UK - which is planning vast nuclear power expansion - to steer clear.

""Going further in offshore wind, as the UK has been doing, and building it out domestically, also on land, going for energy efficiency - I think that's a safer way to go,"" she said.

Ms Morgan, who represents one of the world's largest emitters and economies, also spoke about what keeps her awake at night.

""That we're moving too slowly,"" she said. ""That the pace and scale of change isn't fast enough, and that we have to do so many things at once.

""How do we get everyone to act as if it is the crisis that it is?""

In a court filing, Elvis Presley's ex-wife disputes an amendment to Lisa Marie's living trust that would see Priscilla replaced as an overseer of her daughter's estate.

A living trust is a form of estate planning that allows a person to control their assets while alive, but have them distributed if they die, and can serve the function of a will if a separate will is not filed.

Lisa Marie, the only child of Elvis and Priscilla, died on 12 January aged 54. She has been laid to rest at her father's Graceland mansion in Memphis, Tennessee.

Priscilla Presley's lawyers argue that there were ""many issues surrounding the authenticity and validity"" of the amendment to the will.

They are said to include a misspelling of Priscilla's name in a document allegedly signed by her daughter and the failure to notify her of the change.

Another issue was a signature by Lisa Marie that was ""inconsistent with her usual and customary signature"", lawyers said.

The court filing in Los Angeles noted that Priscilla Presley and former business manager Barry Siegel had been placed in charge of the living trust in 1993 and reaffirmed in 2010.

It also said that Priscilla Presley discovered a document existed pertaining to be an amendment to the trust dated 11 March 2016.

It said the ""purported"" amendment replaced her and Mr Siegel as both current and successor trustees, naming Lisa Marie's children Riley Keough and Benjamin Keough ""as successor co-trustees of the trust"" upon their mother's death.

The filing states that Mr Siegel had already intended to resign from his position, which would have left Priscilla Presley and Ms Keough as co-trustees.

Benjamin Keough took his own life in 2020 aged 27. His sister Riley, 33, is an actress.

A Russian court has jailed a man for 12 years for attempting to burn down a military enlistment office in Siberia - in a ruling that classified his crime as an ""act of terrorism"".

The decision by a military court in Yekaterinburg was the first time the terrorism designation had been used to punish someone for an arson attack on an enlistment office, the TASS state-run news agency said.

Vladislav Borisenko, who was accused of trying to burn down a building in the Siberian city of Nizhnevartovsk in May, was sentenced to 12 years.

Part of his sentence will be spent in prison, and the rest in a maximum security prison colony.

TASS said the fire had spread across an area of one square kilometre, but that nobody had been hurt.

Mr Borisenko had carried out the attack with another man and they had both allegedly confessed their guilt, it said, saying they had purportedly acted on the promise of receiving a financial reward from a third party.

There are a few reasons why the UK comes out of these latest International Monetary Fund forecasts especially badly.

The main one is that the previous IMF forecast, produced in October, didn't reflect the impact of the mini-budget. That partly explains why the UK got a downgrade when most other countries saw upgrades to their prospects.

Then there's the fact that the IMF seems to be taking a particularly pessimistic view on how quickly inflation will fall in the UK. This may or may not be right but it certainly paints the UK in a worse light than most of its peers.

UK economy to fare worse than any other country in developed world this year, IMF forecasts

Minister dismisses International Monetary Fund's warning of sharp contraction for UK economy as 'wrong'

But neither of these provisos will be of much comfort in the Treasury. As recently as a few weeks ago it was able to justify the country's weak economic performance by pointing to October's IMF forecasts, which showed that a third of the world's economies were facing a recession and that the UK, weak as it was, would end up somewhere in the middle of the pack of industrialised economies.

Now, the story is far more stark.

Britain is an outlier - the only major country to see its economy contract this year, the only nation with a recessionary forecast.

The fact that even Russia, which is facing the full might of Western sanctions, not to mention a brain drain as its citizens abandon ship, is slated to do better this year and next is doubly humiliating.

It's possible, as I wrote above, that the IMF has got things wrong.

It's also certainly the case that things are looking a touch better here than they were only a few months ago. Contrary to the Bank of England's forecasts, the UK is not yet in recession (two successive quarters of economic contraction).

Other countries bouncing back faster

The problem is that other countries seem to be bouncing back far faster than this one.

This seems to come back to a few issues. The IMF points to the fact that Britain is especially sensitive to high gas prices (largely because we still heat most of our homes with it).

It points to the fact that a large chunk of the workforce left the labour market during the pandemic and hasn't come back.

But there's another, deeper issue.

While other countries around the world (most notably the US) are pouring billions of dollars of investment into their green energy industries, the Sunak government has just slashed public investment totals.

It is raising taxes into this slowdown, even as the Bank raises interest rates. That will exacerbate the cost of living crisis.

Director Antoine Fuqua and producer Graham King said Jaafar Jackson, whose father is Jermaine Jackson, had a natural ability to emulate his uncle and bring him to life.

The official Michael Jackson account tweeted: ""Have you heard the news? Michael's nephew, Jaafar, has been chosen to portray Michael in the upcoming biopic on the King of Pop!""

Lionsgate Studio said the biographical movie, called Michael, will explore ""the complicated man who became the King of Pop"".

The film will include ""all aspects"" of his life and his most noteworthy performances that set him on the path to becoming an icon in the musical world"", it said in a statement.

Lionsgate did not directly address one of the most controversial aspects of Jackson's story - his trial on child sex abuse charges in 2005 and additional allegations against the singer featured in the 2019 documentary, Leaving Neverland.

In 2005, Jackson was acquitted by a California jury in the sex abuse case involving a 13-year-old boy.

The 2019 documentary followed the accounts of Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who claimed they were befriended by Jackson and sexually abused by him from ages seven and 10, respectively, in the early 1990s.

Jackson died aged 50 on 25 June 2009 just as he was preparing for his This Is It comeback tour.

While the creators of the film looked far and wide for the right person for the role, it seems their answer was closer to home.

King was a producer on award-winning Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, which stars Rami Malek.

The plan will introduce around 1,800 new shift leader roles in stores, leading on the day-to-day operational duties on the shop floor, the UK's largest supermarket chain said.

The counters and hot delis will close from 26 February, the retailer added, after ongoing reviews of the counters have taken place since 2019. But most hot counters and delis have already been removed from the majority of shops, it said.

Since 2019 Tesco said it has seen a significant decrease in demand for the counters and that customers no longer say they are a significant reason for them to visit stores.

All workers affected by the closures will be offered alternatives roles, it said, but it did not say how many staff work on counters and delis.

Hot and deli counters may not disappear entirely, Tesco said. ""Where we can work with a third party to offer a counter experience in-store, we will continue to do so.""

Jason Tarry, Tesco UK and ROI chief executive, said: ""These are difficult decisions to make, but they are necessary to ensure we remain focused on delivering value for our customers wherever we can, as well as ensuring our store offer reflects what our customers value the most.""

The changing management structures will impact around 1,750 workers as the number of lead and team managers in large shops will be reduced.

Tesco said those affected will have the option of moving into shift leader roles ""with financial support"" or taking redundancy.

An estimated 350 workers will be impacted by a series of localised changes, such as the closure of eight pharmacies and reduced hours at some in-store post offices, the store group added.

Providing more detail about the management staff affected, Tesco said in a statement: ""With the introduction of these new shift leader roles and realignment of management roles, we have taken the difficult decision to reduce the number of lead and team managers in our large stores, impacting around 1,750 colleagues.

""We are supporting colleagues impacted by these changes, who will have the option of moving into shift leader vacancies with financial support or taking redundancy.""

ElevenLabs released a so-called voice cloning suite earlier this month.

It allows users to upload clips of someone speaking, which are used to generate an artificial voice.

This can then be applied to the firm's text-to-speech speech synthesis feature, which by default offers a list of characters with various accents that can read up to 2,500 characters of text at once.

It didn't take long for the internet at large to start experimenting with the technology, including on the infamous anonymous image board site 4chan, where generated clips included Harry Potter actress Emma Watson reading a passage from Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf.

Other files found by Sky News included what sounds like Joe Biden announcing that US troops will go into Ukraine, and a potty-mouthed David Attenborough boasting about a career in the Navy Seals.

Film director James Cameron, Top Gun star Tom Cruise, and podcaster Joe Rogan have been targeted, and there are also clips of fictional characters, often reading deeply offensive, racist, or misogynistic messages.

In a statement on Twitter, ElevenLabs - which was founded last year by ex-Google engineer Piotr Dabkowski and former Palantir strategist Mati Staniszewski - asked for feedback on how to prevent misuse of its technology.

""Crazy weekend - thank you to everyone for trying out our Beta platform,"" it said.

""While we see our tech being overwhelmingly applied to positive use, we also see an increasing number of voice cloning misuse cases. We want to reach out to Twitter community for thoughts and feedback!""

The company said that while it could ""trace back any generated audio"" to the user who made it, it also wanted to introduce ""additional safeguards"".

It suggested requiring additional account checks, such as asking for payment details or ID; verifying someone's copyright to the clips they upload; or dropping the tool altogether to manually verify each voice cloning request.

But as of Tuesday morning, the tool remained online in the same state.

The company's website suggests its technology could one day be used to give voice to articles, newsletters, books, educational material, video games, and films.

Sky News has contacted ElevenLabs for further comment.

Dangers of AI generated media

The deluge of inappropriate voice clips is a reminder of the perils of releasing AI tools into the public sphere without sufficient safeguards in place - previous examples include a Microsoft chatbot which had to be taken down after quickly being taught to say offensive things.

Earlier this month, researchers at the tech giant announced they had made a text-to-speech AI called VALL-E that could simulate a person's voice based on just three seconds of audio.

They said they would not be releasing the tool to the public because ""it may carry potential risks"", including people ""spoofing voice identification or impersonating a specific speaker"".

The technology presents many of the same challenges as deepfake videos, which have become increasingly widespread on the internet.

Last year, a deepfake video of Volodymyr Zelenskyy telling Ukrainians to ""lay down arms"" was shared online.

It came after the creator of a series of realistic Tom Cruise deepfakes, albeit more light-hearted clips purporting to show the actor doing magic tricks and playing golf, warned viewers about the technology's potential.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131113336/http://news.sky.com/story/extra-safeguards-coming-after-ai-generator-used-to-make-celebrity-voices-read-offensive-messages-12799703;7

Megan Baynes, cost of living reporter says:

Well, first of all - congratulations! Ryanair does allow you to change your flight date and route up to two-and-a-half hours before the plane is scheduled to depart.

But, unfortunately, you will likely have to pay a fee.

Online it will cost you £45 per passenger, per one-way flight (so £90 per return). If you call their reservation center, or try and change it at the airport, this will be £60 per passenger per one-way flight (so £120 a return).

Given flights with Ryanair - dependent on the destination - can be quite cheap, you could end up paying more to change the date than you did on your original flight.

It's worth checking your travel insurance if you took some out before you became pregnant, because this may cover the cost of cancelling and rebooking the flights. Each policy varies but give the insurance provider a call and they can talk you through it.

I've also had a look at the small print and - you might already know this - but for uncomplicated single pregnancies, Ryanair restricts travel beyond the end of the 36th week. For twins, triplets, and so on, it is beyond the end of the 32nd week.

However, complicating things further, Ryanair reserves the right to refuse travel to an expectant mother over 28 weeks pregnant and who does not have a 'fit to fly' certificate from a doctor or midwife so make sure you plan your holiday well in advance of these dates and have all the right papers -have a great holiday.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131113336/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-tesco-hot-deli-shake-up-puts-thousands-of-jobs-at-risk-why-has-the-imf-downgraded-the-uk-12615118;2

Authorities say Sharaban K, a 23-year-old beautician of Iraqi descent from Munich, searched for women who resembled her closely online before killing one of them in order to go into hiding, German news outlets are reporting.

The case has been dubbed the ""doppelganger murder"", in reference to a German folktale about a ghostly identical spirit, but the word doppelganger also has come to mean a stranger who looks like a twin.

The suspect and others involved in the case are being referred to by their first names and last initials, as is customary in the German legal system.

Police first discovered a blood-covered body in August last year in a parked Mercedes in Ingolstadt, southern Germany.

Reports initially identified the victim as Sharaban K, but a post mortem examination raised questions about the body's identity.

The victim was eventually named as Khadidja O, a 23-year-old beauty blogger from the neighbouring state of Baden-Wurttemberg.

Police later stated the victim and Sharaban K were ""strikingly alike"" in appearance due to their physical similarities such as straight black hair.

On 19 August, officers detained Sharaban K and a friend accused of plotting the scheme.

The full extent of the case and their alleged motives were not publicly disclosed by authorities until this week, and it is has now emerged prosecutors believe Sharaban K planned to fake her own death due to a dispute with family.

""Investigations have led us to assume that the accused wanted to go into hiding because of a family dispute and fake her own death to that effect,"" Veronika Grieser, of the Ingolstadt state prosecutor's office, said in a statement.

Ms Grieser explained that investigations uncovered several attempts by Sharaban K to reach out to women on social media she resembled in the week before the alleged murder.

She is said to have operated under aliases and attempted to set up meetings with the women.

While many of these attempts proved unsuccessful, she eventually managed to set up a meeting with Khadidja O by making a ""cosmetics offer"", authorities allege.

Sharaban K and Sheqir K are accused of picking up the woman before taking her to a forested area between Heilbronn and Ingolstadt, before stabbing her to death.

Arrest warrants were issued for both women last week, and they each face life in prison if convicted.

Police spokesperson Andreas Aichele told the German tabloid newspaper Bild: ""The crime weapon has not been found, but the evidence is overwhelming. The victim was killed with over 50 thrusts of the knife, the face completely disfigured.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131113336/http://news.sky.com/story/doppelganger-murder-german-woman-accused-of-killing-her-lookalike-in-attempt-to-fake-her-own-death-12799704;5

He also defended the 3% of his £320,000 appearance fee which he donated to charity as a ""decent sum"".

The former health secretary said the £10,000 donation was ""more than my MPs' salary"" that he still received while appearing on the reality TV show in the Australian jungle.

Entering the show despite criticism from constituents and colleagues, Mr Hancock's team had told reporters he would be donating a portion of his appearance fee.

Ahead of his appearance, Mr Hancock said he signed up to raise awareness of dyslexia, which he was diagnosed with while at Oxford University.

Mr Hancock later revealed he had given a share of the £10,000 sum to the St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk and the British Dyslexia Association after official records showed his fee amounted to £320,000.

""I didn't primarily do it [go on the reality show] for the money, I primarily did it to try to show who I am,"" Mr Hancock told ITV's Good Morning Britain programme.

""I think £10,000 is actually a decent sum.""

He also confirmed he still received his MP salary while in the jungle, but said his donations were larger than that sum, which is around £7,000 per month.

The West Suffolk MP, who was kicked out of the Conservative Party over his appearance on the show, did concede that ""of course there was a discussion and negotiation over the fee"".

But he argued that he ""certainly would have considered"" appearing on the programme for just £10.

He also denied that negotiations about his fee soared after he turned down initial offers.

Mr Hancock finished in third place on the show behind actor Owen Warner and England professional footballer Jill Scott.

Records on the MPs' register of interests showed Mr Hancock received £320,000 from Lifted Entertainment, ITV Studios, for the work which he listed as lasting for 30 days.

The appearance was criticised by many MPs, including the prime minister.

More than 1,000 complaints were made to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom over his participation.

He also backed former PM Boris Johnson for keeping Priti Patel in place as home secretary despite her being found to have broken the ministerial code over bullying allegations.

The first claims against the deputy PM emerged in The Guardian and relate to his stint at the Ministry of Justice between September 2021 and September 2022 under Boris Johnson.

Around 15 senior civil servants in his private office had been offered ""respite or a route out"" after his return was announced, the newspaper said, due to concerns some were still traumatised from working for him.

Multiple MoJ sources also said he had previously created a ""culture of fear"" in the department, alleging he was ""very rude and aggressive"", adding: ""[He] wasn't just unprofessional, he was a bully.""

A spokesperson for the department said there was ""zero tolerance for bullying across the civil service"".

Hours later, a report in The Sun claimed he had thrown tomatoes from his salad at staff.

Another in The Mirror said he had been given the nickname ""The Incinerator"" because of how quickly he ""burns through"" employees.

A spokesman for the deputy PM dismissed the salad attack claim as ""complete nonsense"" and denied a high turnover of staff in his departments.

Sky News has learnt that Britain's biggest supermarket chain is in advanced talks about buying Paperchase's name and other intellectual property through a pre-pack administration that could take place as early as Tuesday.

Sources close to the situation said Tesco was unlikely to be interested in any of Paperchase's stores, meaning that most of its workforce may face the prospect of losing their jobs.

It was unclear on Tuesday morning whether any other suitors were in talks about a deal.

Sky News revealed this week that the chain was on the brink of administration as hopes of a solvent rescue deal faded.

Begbies Traynor, the professional services firm, is lined up to handle the insolvency following a sale process run by PricewaterhouseCoopers over recent weeks.

Paperchase was put up for sale late last year, just four months after its most recent change of ownership.

The chain was taken over in August by Steve Curtis, an experienced retail investor who has been involved with Tie Rack and Jigsaw.

Retail Realisation, an industry advisory firm with which Mr Curtis and turnaround firm Rcapital are affiliated, was also involved in last summer's deal.

Paperchase had previously been one of many retail casualties of COVID-19, having undergone a pre-pack administration in January 2021.

Other notable high street chains to collapse during the pandemic included Debenhams and the Dorothy Perkins-to-TopShop empire, Arcadia Group.

It trades from about 100 stores, and Mr Curtis was said at the time of the most recent takeover to be backing an existing management plan to grow that number to approximately 150 in the coming years.

Permira Credit, the previous owner, had invested in Paperchase's digital offering as well as new shop openings and executive recruitment since its last brush with insolvency.

At that time, Paperchase employed nearly 1,300 people, and traded from more than 125 sites across the UK.

Its outlets included concessions at House of Fraser, Selfridges and a number of Next stores.

It comes after Ukrainian officials stepped up calls for allies to donate advanced warplanes so they can control their airspace.

They are currently using old Soviet-era jets.

There are concerns sending such technology could escalate the conflict and be viewed by Russia as NATO countries entering the war by proxy.

Speaking on Tuesday, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The UK's Typhoon and F-35 fighter jets are extremely sophisticated and take months to learn how to fly. Given that, we believe it is not practical to send those jets into Ukraine.

""We will continue to provide and accelerate our military support to Ukraine and listen carefully to their requests.

""It is the length of time it takes to learn how to use what are very complex pieces of equipment that is the limiting factor in this case but we will explore what more we can do to support Ukraine.""

On Monday, Britain's defence secretary had said he was keeping an open mind about joining any future coalition supplying jets.

""Descriptions of how the bereaved were treated by police officers in the immediate aftermath of the disaster make harrowing reading..."" adds the introduction to today's report.

""When compassion and leadership were most needed, the bereaved were often treated insensitively and the response lacked coordination and oversight.""

The reforms are in reply to the former bishop of Liverpool, James Jones, who made formal recommendations for ensuring the suffering of Hillsborough families is not repeated.

They were published five years ago, but the national police response couldn't be made public until legal proceedings and other matters were over.

Today's report says Hillsborough must be ""the touchstone for more ethical police leadership"" - and as such candour will become a key theme of the police's updated code of ethics.

A supporting code of practice - which senior police must follow - will also set out ""a responsibility to ensure openness and candour within their force"".

'Deeply sorry'

Other reforms include new national guidance for the family liaison officers - the point of contact with relatives when somebody is involved in a tragedy such as Hillsborough.

Findings from the 2017 report, as well as tragedies like Grenfell Tower, have been fed into the latest best practice.

A new code of practice on police information and records management is also being implemented after records relating to Hillsborough were lost or destroyed.

Senior police repeated their apologies for the disaster as they published their response on Tuesday.

Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), said he was ""deeply sorry for the tragic loss of life, and for the pain and suffering that the families of the 97 victims experienced on that day and in the many years that have followed"".

He said they were now committed to responding to major incidents with ""openness and with compassion for the families"" above any other interest.

""Collectively, the changes made since the Hillsborough disaster and in response to Rt Reverend James Jones's report aim to ensure the terrible police failures made on the day and in the aftermath can never happen again.""

'Promises must become law'

The former bishop said he welcomed the police response and its acknowledgment that the treatment of families was ""harrowing"".

He also welcomed the NPCC's new ""duty of candour"" and its view that bereaved families should have as much legal representation as public bodies after a tragedy.

He said the government must now make these two principles legally binding as ""Hillsborough Law"".

The government has yet to formally respond to the 2017 report - something a survivors' group says is stopping families from being able to move on.

Chairman of the Hillsborough Survivors' Support Alliance, Peter Scarfe, also called the five-year wait for a police response ""way too long"".

He said the police reforms should be put into law to make a real difference.

""It's not quite Hillsborough Law - I would expect Hillsborough Law to be passed,"" he said.

""It's easy saying we've learnt from it, we're going to correct our mistakes, we'll make sure accountability is there, we can't cover things up - but without a law they can.""

The prime minister's official spokesman said part of the delay in responding to James Jones's report had been to avoid the risk of prejudicing criminal cases.

""The government has been working closely with the relevant departments and organisations to carefully consider and address the points directed at government,"" the spokesman said.

""That's alongside the work with the police, because there are elements that span both government and policing.""

He said there was no specific date for a response as ""it's important to ensure we do this properly"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131121452/http://news.sky.com/story/police-promise-to-admit-mistakes-and-not-defend-the-indefensible-after-hillsborough-report-recommendations-12799806;3

The union said workers across five services will walk out as the long-running dispute over pay and staffing continues.

Ambulance workers in London, Yorkshire, the South West, North East and North West will be involved in the industrial action.

Strikes will now be happening across the NHS every day next week apart from Wednesday.

'Toxic cocktail' behind dire economy forecast - politics latest

Downing Street said the latest strike action by ambulance workers is ""deeply concerning"".

""We are putting in place significant mitigations that have previously helped reduce some of the impact from these strikes,"" the PM's official spokesperson said.

""But first and foremost we would ask the unions to reconsider that approach and continue discussions.""

Announcing the latest industrial action, Unison urged ministers to stop ""pretending the strikes will simply go away"" and improve ambulance workers' pay.

The union also warned that unless the government has a ""major rethink"" over NHS pay, and gets involved in ""actual talks"" with unions, it will announce strike dates running into March.

It added that by then, the dispute is likely to affect double the number of trusts and extend to the whole of the ambulance service in England.

""The government must stop playing games. Rishi Sunak wants the public to believe ministers are doing all they can to resolve the dispute. They're not,"" the union's head of health Sara Gorton said.

""There are no pay talks, and the prime minister must stop trying to hoodwink the public. It's time for some honesty. Ministers are doing precisely nothing to end the dispute.

""The government's tactics seem to be to dig in, wait months for the pay review body report and hope the dispute goes away. It won't. And in the meantime, staff will carry on quitting, and patients being let down.

""There can be no health service without the staff to run it. Ministers must open proper talks to end the dispute and put in place the urgent retention plan needed to boost pay and staffing across the NHS.""

The latest strike announcement comes as ministers are braced for the biggest day of industrial action in over a decade on Wednesday when teachers, university lecturers, train drivers, civil servants, bus drivers and security guards stop work on the same day.

The PM's spokesperson conceded that Wednesday's mass strike action will be ""very difficult"".

Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) voted overwhelmingly in favour of action in a ballot result announced on Monday.

The FBU has said it is giving the government and employers 10 days to make an improved offer before deciding its next move.

If they go ahead, the strikes will be the first nationwide fire strikes over pay since 2003.

The British Medical Association (BMA) - the country's biggest doctors' union - is to hold an indicative ballot of its consultant members in February in a dispute over pay and pensions.

As Russia cut off gas supplies to Europe last year, countries including the UK, Germany and Italy put more coal power on standby to fill the gaps, raising feared of increased greenhouse gas emissions from the most polluting fossil fuel.

But the bloc fended off a feared dramatic increase in burning coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, which is globally being phased down in a bid to curb climate change.

Ember, the green think tank that completed the analysis, celebrated the achievement amid a ""triple crisis in the electricity sector"".

As Europe raced to cut ties with its biggest supplier of fossil gas, Russia, it also grappled with the lowest levels of hydropower for at least 20 years amid a severe drought.

At times, half of France's vast nuclear power fleet were offline due to ongoing defects or a backlog of maintenance issues.

Coal power share did rise by 1.5 percentage points to generate 16% of electricity, but it amounted to only ""a minor ripple in coal power and a huge wave of support for renewables"", said Ember's head of data insights, Dave Jon

Lower electricity demand also helped reduce the energy deficit, dropping by 7.9% in the last quarter of 2022 compared to the same period the previous year.

Mild weather was a significant factor, but concerns about costs, improved energy efficiency measures and ""citizens acting in solidarity to cut energy demand in a time of crisis"" likely also helped, Mr Ember said.

However, the EU remains one of the world's largest emitters of climate-heating greenhouse gases, and its climate targets, policies, and finance are rated ""insufficient"" by the authoritative Climate Action Tracker.

Alexandru Mustata, coal campaigner at Europe Beyond Coal, warned that ""countries like Bulgaria and Romania are trying to use the moment to construct a narrative that coal has a future.

62;62;2941;2941;Andrea Riseborough: Why a British star's Oscar nomination has sparked controversy;Tuesday 31 January 2023 13:11, UK;['gemma peplow', '@gemmapeplow'];['andrea riseborough', 'oscars'];['oscar', 'controversy', 'riseboroughs', 'andrea', 'academy', 'actress', 'oscars', 'leslie', 'riseborough', 'nomination', 'film', 'stars', 'campaign', 'sparked', 'awards', 'british'];"When British actress Andrea Riseborough's name was read out as one of this year's five Academy Award nominees for best actress, it came as something of a surprise to many.

Not because her performance in To Leslie - a small indie film in which she plays a single mother who turns to alcoholism after winning the lottery - wasn't worthy, but because there had been no substantial awards-season buzz surrounding her before the announcement.

This is how it works: the Oscars is the biggest night in Hollywood, the culmination of awards season, but it's not the only ceremony in Tinseltown.

Many will no doubt be aware of some of the events, such as the Golden Globes, while others including the SAG awards are less well known. And of course, there is also the BAFTAs in the UK.

Each awards ceremony has its own members voting but you tend to see the same names cropping up on the shortlists, give or take a few.

In 2022, for example, Will Smith, Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose and Troy Kotsur picked up the four acting prizes at pretty much every single ceremony, including, finally, the Oscars.

Riseborough, who starred in Roald Dahl's Matilda The Musical in 2022 and is also known for The Kindness Of Strangers, Made In Dagenham and Birdman, did not receive nominations for any other awards this year, and nor did To Leslie.

However, before the Oscar nominees were announced, Riseborough did publicly receive the backing of some very prominent A-listers (more on this later).

During awards season, film studios campaign, campaign, campaign - which means projects with the biggest budgets are more likely to get noticed by voters.

The To Leslie campaign was reportedly self-funded and relied on word of mouth to get noticed.

Questions have now been raised as to whether Riseborough's nomination was fair - in an escalating row which has led to criticism once again of diversity at the Oscars, where none of the best actress nominees are black - and seen her co-star and others speaking out to defend her.

Blockbusters, first-timers and snubs - Oscars talking points

Although it did not mention To Leslie, the Academy, which organises the Oscars, has announced it is conducting a review of award ""campaign procedures"" to ensure no guidelines were violated this year.

The issue is due to be discussed at its next meeting later today.

So what is Oscar campaigning? What did Riseborough's celebrity backers apparently do wrong? Is any of it really fair? Here's everything you need to know.

Who is Angela Riseborough?

The 41-year-old actress is known for her work in the Oscar-winning Birdman, and for playing Wallis Simpson in WE and the former prime minister in Margaret Thatcher: The Long Walk To Finchley.

In 2022, she starred in the latest adaptation of Matilda, playing Matilda's mother Mrs Wormwood alongside Stephen Graham as Mr Wormwood, as well as Emma Thompson as Ms Trunchbull, Lashana Lynch as Miss Honey, and Alisha Weir in the titular role.

She also starred in Battle Of The Sexes, about the 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, playing King's lover Marilyn Barnett, and appeared in an episode of Black Mirror.

Riseborough was the first British actress to formally support the #4PercentChallenge, urging members of the film industry to work with female directors, following its launch by Creed actress Tessa Thompson at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2019.

She is nominated for her performance in To Leslie, a small-budget film which reportedly grossed around $27,000 (about £22,000) at the box office, according to US entertainment site Variety.

Which celebrities supported her?

In the run-up to the Oscar nominations, To Leslie broke through with the Academy seemingly in no small part thanks to a campaign by some of the most prominent names in Hollywood.

Indeed, Cate Blanchett, who is also up for the best actress Oscar alongside Riseborough, used her Critics' Choice speech to praise the Brition - along with others, it should be noted.

""Best actress, I mean, it is extremely arbitrary considering how many extraordinary performances there have been by women; not only in this room, but Andrea Riseborough and Tang Wei, Penelope Cruz, the list goes on and on,"" she said. Blanchett continued by saying she wanted to change how awards work and highlight the ""raft"" of performances.

Fellow Hollywood stars including Kate Winslet, Amy Adams, Gwyneth Paltrow, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Aniston, Zooey Deschanel, Frances Fisher and Helen Hunt have also praised Riseborough's performance.

Fisher, known for films including Titanic and Unforgiven, has been particularly vocal on social media about the actress's performance.

What's wrong with any of this?

There's nothing wrong with encouraging Oscar voters to watch a particular film, or praising a performance.

However, some posts supporting Riseborough on social media may have broken Academy rules if they reference ""competition"" by name or title.

If a formal complaint is filed, this could result in Fisher receiving a one-year suspension from the Academy, according to reports.

There is no suggestion that Riseborough broke rules herself.

But questions remain as to the authenticity of the backing for her. Were all these supporters genuinely wowed by her performance, or simply friends in high places, helping out a mate?

What is Oscar campaigning?

Studios can spend millions of dollars promoting their films in the run-up to and during awards season, making sure they have the attention of voters.

The aim is to construct a narrative that a film is ""Oscar worthy"".

Billboards go up, screening events are held, the stars will walk red carpets, do interviews, meet the right people.

In 2016, Susan Sarandon called for ""campaign finance reform"", saying the Oscars campaign race had become ""enormous"".

What has the Academy said about the latest controversy?

A statement released by the Academy on Friday did not reference Riseborough or To Leslie specifically.

""It is the Academy's goal to ensure that the awards competition is conducted in a fair and ethical manner, and we are committed to ensuring an inclusive awards process,"" the statement read.

""We are conducting a review of the campaign procedures around this year's nominees, to ensure that no guidelines were violated, and to inform us whether changes to the guidelines may be needed in a new era of social media and digital communication.

""We have confidence in the integrity of our nomination and voting procedures, and support genuine grassroots campaigns for outstanding performances.""

Why has this led to criticism about diversity at the Oscars?

This year, none of the best actress nominees are black.

Riseborough and Blanchett (Tar) are up for the award alongside Michelle Yeoh (Everything Everywhere All At Once), Michelle Williams (The Fabelmans) and Ana de Armas (Blonde), while strong contenders Viola Davis (The Woman King) and Danielle Deadwyler (Till) missed out.

Following the nominations announcement, Till director Chinonye Chukwu posted a statement on Instagram, saying: ""We live in a world and work in industries that are so aggressively committed to upholding whiteness and perpetuating an unabashed misogyny towards Black women.

""And yet.

""I am forever in gratitude for the greatest lesson of my life - regardless of any challenges or obstacles, I will always have the power to cultivate my own joy, and it is this joy that will continue to be one of my greatest forms of resistance.""

Of course, Davis and Deadwyler's names being missing from the shortlist is not Riseborough's fault.

When it comes to analysis of the nominees, the nods for de Armas and Williams have also been questioned - de Armas as the Marilyn Monroe biopic Blonde has been widely panned, despite her performance being praised, and Williams as the role of Mitzi Fabelman in The Fabelmans is considered by some to be a supporting role.

Support for Riseborough

Following the Academy's announcement, stars have spoken out in defence of Riseborough and To Leslie.

In the latest episode of his WTF podcast, her To Leslie co-star Marc Maron criticised the Academy's investigation.

""Apparently, the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences or whatever the f*** it is has decided to investigate Andrea Riseborough's grassroots campaign to get her the Oscar nomination,"" he said. ""Because I guess it so threatens their system that they're completely bought out by corporate interests in the form of studios.

""Millions of dollars [are] put into months and months of advertising campaigns, publicity, screenings by large corporate entertainment entities and Andrea was championed by her peers through a grassroots campaign which was pushed through by a few actors.

""The Academy is [like], 'Well, we gotta take a look at this. This is not the way it's supposed to work. Independent artists don't deserve the attention of the Academy unless we see how it works exactly. So, we're going to look into this'.""

Actress Christina Ricci apparently also defended Riseborough in an Instagram post, which has reportedly since been deleted. According to US entertainment site Deadline, the star wrote: ""So it's only the films and actors that can afford the campaigns that deserve recognition? Feels elitist and exclusive and frankly very backward to me.""

What happens now?

Well, it's down to the Academy to decide. Many think it's unlikely Riseborough's nomination will be withdrawn.

But even if she remains in the race, the nomination may now seem tainted - and following the initial positive reaction to her nod, voters could see her as too controversial to pick to win.

And for studios: why bother with all the promo when A-list recommendations can make even more impact?

Whether rules have been broken or not, this saga has lifted the lid on the deep pockets of awards campaigning - and how it's good promo, not necessarily just a good performance, that can turn a film or a star into a winner.

Dallas Police said no arrests had been made in any of the investigations - which also included cages being cut and the suspicious death of an endangered bird - and did not confirm whether the incidents were linked.

In the latest case, officers believe someone cut an opening in an enclosure and took the two emperor tamarin monkeys, which are small primates with long whiskers that resemble a moustache.

""It was clear the habitat had been intentionally compromised,"" the zoo said in a statement.

Earlier this month, the zoo closed for a day-long search when a clouded leopard named Nova went missing.

She was eventually found near her habitat, but police said a tool had been used to cut an opening in its fencing.

A week later, an endangered vulture called Pin was found dead, with the zoo saying the death did not appear to be natural.

Gregg Hudson, the zoo's chief executive, said the vulture was found with a wound.

Ed Hansen, chief executive of the American Association of Zoo Keepers, said he could not recall a zoo that had dealt with so many similar incidents with such frequency.

""It appears that somebody really has an issue with the Dallas Zoo,"" he said.

Mr Hansen described Dallas Zoo's reputation as ""excellent"" within the industry, adding that accredited zoos had double-perimeter fencing and that a zoo as large as Dallas' would have a security patrol.

Health Secretary Steve Barclay, talking to the Health and Social Care Committee, says NHS worker retention is ""very important"" to solving the current strikes.

He says on average the additional income, on top of an NHS worker's base salary, is 29%.

He also says pension contributions for nurses are 20% which is higher than the private sector.

The health secretary says when looking at keeping staff they need to be looking at the overall remuneration package, not just the base pay.

When asked why that approach isn't working at the moment, he says there are other pressures and ""we are recruiting more than are leaving"".

However, he said there is a time lag between training people and them being fully qualified.

Mr Barclay said they need to look at more flexibility for staff, something he said trade union bosses have paid interest to.

By increasing interest rates to 4%, the Bank of England may help savers, according to financial experts.



Following a period of ultra-low savings rates below 1%, a new account - potentially at a new bank - may offer a better return, according to Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest.

But with hints from the Bank that rates may have peaked, savers should consider acting before inflation drops, she said.

There are ""good options"" out there for savers, said Victor Trokoudes, CEO of the investment and budgeting app Plum.

""With a wide range of interest rates available at banks and via smart money apps like Plum, there are some good options out there for growing your savings.""

Jason Ferrando, the CEO of money-lending platform easyMoney, called on more banks to increase return yields for their customers.

""Despite this latest rate rise hurting variable rate borrowers, there is a flip-side for investors and savers that is the yield on their savings may see a better return thanks to today's Bank of England decision.""

68;68;2950;2950;Who are the runners and riders to replace Nadhim Zahawi as Conservative Party chair?;Tuesday 31 January 2023 13:44, UK;['faye brown', '@fayebrownsky'];['nadhim zahawi'];['chair', 'mr', 'sky', 'conservative', 'nadhim', 'runners', 'chairman', 'replace', 'party', 'tory', 'mp', 'riders', 'zahawi', 'right', 'told'];"Speculation is growing about who will replace Nadhim Zahawi as Conservative Party chair after he was sacked over his tax affairs.

Rishi Sunak is under pressure to pick the right candidate as he struggles to draw a line under 'Tory sleaze' allegations - despite vowing to turn over a new leaf when he became prime minister.

Allies of Boris Johnson have already touted him as a potential successor, but there are others who are calling for someone who can create a ""positive headline"" to help turn around the party's fortunes in the polls.

The party chair is responsible for party administration and overseeing the Conservative Campaign Headquarters.

Here, Sky News looks at the potential runners and riders.

Boris Johnson

There has been speculation of a Johnson comeback after Jacob Rees-Mogg said he has ""all the right attributes"" to be party chairman.

The senior Tory MP and close ally of the former PM told GB News on Sunday: ""He is charismatic, he rallies the troops. He's a sort of fully-loaded Conservative. So I think that type of personality would be a very good one for a party chairman.""

However, others have warned such a move would be divisive, while Mr Rees-Mogg on Tuesday conceded the former prime minister's return to the front bench is unlikely.

""I think he would be a brilliant chairman, but he's not going to be chairman"", he told Sky News.

""The person who is going to be chairman needs to be someone who is close to the prime minister and also very charismatic.""

Paul Scully

The Tory vice chair under Theresa May and deputy chair under Boris Johnson, minister for London Paul Scully is seen as someone with the right skills and experience to replace Mr Zahawi.

Ex-cabinet minister Theresa Villiers is among those endorsing him, telling Sky News: ""Paul is a top campaigner. He has done brilliant work in this constituency and did very well when he was Deputy Chair at CCHQ.

""He knows how important it is to engage with minority ethnic groups and he also understands London which is a key electoral battleground.""

Justin Tomlinson

A relative outsider is the Conservative MP for North Swindon, Justin Tomlinson.

He was deputy chair during the successful Bexley by-election in December 2021 - the last by-election the Conservatives won.

Mr Tomlinson quit his position in July 2022 to help Kemi Badenoch launch her failed leadership bid, but prior to being an MP he ran a business supplying Conservative associations with their campaigning materials and is known to be something of a ""campaigning geek"" among colleagues.

One MP told Sky News: ""With a general election looming, we need someone with a strong track record of campaigning and fundraising. Justin Tomlinson is probably the strongest campaigner we have.""

Another did not go as far as naming him but said he would do a ""brilliant job"" if picked as chairman.

Gillian Keegan

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:31 'No way to stop teacher strike', says Education Secretary Gillian Keegan.

The current education secretary has also been tipped for the role.

In an article looking at Mr Zahawi's potential successors, Paul Goodman, the editor of Conservative Home website, said: ""Downing Street will want an appointment that creates a positive headline. It may take the view that the appointment of a woman will suit.""

The women in cabinet are Suella Braverman, Penny Mordaunt, Therese Coffey, Gillian Keegan, Kemi Badenoch, and Michelle Donelan.

Mr Goodman said: ""The first is too senior, the second too ambitious, the third associated with Liz Truss and the fourth difficult though not impossible to move, given her pivotal role at education. Such an appointment would undoubtedly create a splash.""

Penny Mordaunt

Commons leader Penny Mordaunt is reportedly keen on replacing Mr Zahawi at CCHQ and is said to have pitched her credentials alongside Business Secretary Grant Shapps during last week's cabinet away day.

Gavin Barwell, a Conservative peer and former chief of staff to Mrs May, said that while Mr Shapps has done the job before, Ms Mordaunt ""is probably the best choice"".

He said in the run-up to the election the party chair needs to be an important figure who can communicate with media and has experience campaigning in marginal seats.

He told Times Radio: ""When you look back at Rishi Sunak's cabinet when he put it together, I felt Penny didn't really get a role big enough to suit her talents, so this would give her a front and centre role in the run-up to the election.""

Priti Patel

A popular figure on the right of the party and well-liked among the Tory grassroots, Priti Patel is among the high-profile names tipped to replace Mr Zahawi.

While she has previously turned down the role, sources close to the former home secretary have not ruled out her return to the cabinet, according to the Telegraph.

Lee Anderson

Red Wall MP Lee Anderson has also been named as someone who could replace Mr Zahawi.

Marco Longhi, the Conservative MP for Dudley North, put a poll on Twitter asking who agrees with him that Mr Anderson ""would make a great chairman of the Conservative Party"".

While more than 72% of those who responded voted no, Mr Longhi suggested the hard left had got hold of the poll and the results show ""how worried they would be"".

However, it is unlikely Mr Anderson would be given the role.

The Ashfield MP has been outspoken on issues like foodbank usage and Channel crossings and last week compared the government to ""the band on the Titanic"", according to leaked WhatsApp messages seen by Sky News.

William Hague

After Mr Zahawi's sacking, rumours swirled that former Tory leader William Hague could make a return to frontline politics by filling the vacancy.

But Lord Hague, who is a close ally of Mr Sunak, quickly shut down that speculation.

69;69;2951;2951;Andrea Riseborough: Why a British star's Oscar nomination has sparked controversy;Tuesday 31 January 2023 15:37, UK;['gemma peplow', '@gemmapeplow'];['andrea riseborough', 'oscars'];['oscar', 'controversy', 'andrea', 'academy', 'actress', 'oscars', 'leslie', 'best', 'riseborough', 'nomination', 'film', 'stars', 'campaign', 'sparked', 'awards', 'british'];"When British actress Andrea Riseborough's name was read out as one of this year's five Academy Award nominees for best actress, it came as something of a surprise to many.

Not because her performance in To Leslie - a small indie film in which she plays a single mother who turns to alcoholism after winning the lottery - wasn't worthy, but because there had been no substantial awards-season buzz surrounding her before the announcement.

This is how it works: the Oscars is the biggest night in Hollywood, the culmination of awards season, but it's not the only ceremony in Tinseltown.

Many will no doubt be aware of some of the events, such as the Golden Globes, while others including the SAG awards are less well known. And of course, there is also the BAFTAs in the UK.

Each awards ceremony has its own members voting but you tend to see the same names cropping up on the shortlists, give or take a few.

In 2022, for example, Will Smith, Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose and Troy Kotsur picked up the four acting prizes at pretty much every single ceremony, including, finally, the Oscars.

Riseborough, who starred in Roald Dahl's Matilda The Musical in 2022 and is also known for The Kindness Of Strangers, Made In Dagenham and Birdman, did not receive nominations for any other major awards this year, and nor did To Leslie.

However, before the Oscar nominees were announced, Riseborough did publicly receive the backing of some very prominent A-listers (more on this later).

During awards season, film studios campaign, campaign, campaign - which means projects with the biggest budgets are more likely to get noticed by voters.

The To Leslie campaign was reportedly self-funded and relied on word of mouth to get noticed.

Questions have now been raised as to whether Riseborough's nomination was fair - in an escalating row which has led to criticism once again of diversity at the Oscars, where none of the best actress nominees are black - and seen her co-star and others speaking out to defend her.

Blockbusters, first-timers and snubs - Oscars talking points

Although it did not mention To Leslie, the Academy, which organises the Oscars, has announced it is conducting a review of award ""campaign procedures"" to ensure no guidelines were violated this year.

The issue is due to be discussed at its next meeting later today.

So what is Oscar campaigning? What did Riseborough's celebrity backers apparently do wrong? Is any of it really fair? Here's everything you need to know.

Who is Angela Riseborough?

The 41-year-old actress is known for her work in the Oscar-winning Birdman, and for playing Wallis Simpson in WE and the former prime minister in Margaret Thatcher: The Long Walk To Finchley.

In 2022, she starred in the latest adaptation of Matilda, playing Matilda's mother Mrs Wormwood alongside Stephen Graham as Mr Wormwood, as well as Emma Thompson as Ms Trunchbull, Lashana Lynch as Miss Honey, and Alisha Weir in the titular role.

She also starred in Battle Of The Sexes, about the 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, playing King's lover Marilyn Barnett, and appeared in an episode of Black Mirror.

Riseborough was the first British actress to formally support the #4PercentChallenge, urging members of the film industry to work with female directors, following its launch by Creed actress Tessa Thompson at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2019.

She is nominated for her performance in To Leslie, a small-budget film which reportedly grossed around $27,000 (about £22,000) at the box office, according to US entertainment site Variety.

Which celebrities supported her?

In the run-up to the Oscar nominations, To Leslie broke through with the Academy seemingly in no small part thanks to a campaign by some of the most prominent names in Hollywood.

Indeed, Cate Blanchett, who is also up for the best actress Oscar alongside Riseborough, used her Critics' Choice speech to praise the Brition - along with others, it should be noted.

""Best actress, I mean, it is extremely arbitrary considering how many extraordinary performances there have been by women; not only in this room, but Andrea Riseborough and Tang Wei, Penelope Cruz, the list goes on and on,"" she said. Blanchett continued by saying she wanted to change how awards work and highlight the ""raft"" of performances.

Fellow Hollywood stars including Kate Winslet, Amy Adams, Gwyneth Paltrow, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Aniston, Zooey Deschanel, Frances Fisher and Helen Hunt have also praised Riseborough's performance.

Fisher, known for films including Titanic and Unforgiven, has been particularly vocal on social media about the actress's performance.

What's wrong with any of this?

There's nothing wrong with encouraging Oscar voters to watch a particular film, or praising a performance.

However, some posts supporting Riseborough on social media may have broken Academy rules if they reference ""competition"" by name or title.

If a formal complaint is filed, this could result in Fisher receiving a one-year suspension from the Academy, according to reports.

There is no suggestion that Riseborough broke rules herself.

But questions remain as to the authenticity of the backing for her. Were all these supporters genuinely wowed by her performance, or simply friends in high places, helping out a mate?

What is Oscar campaigning?

Studios can spend millions of dollars promoting their films in the run-up to and during awards season, making sure they have the attention of voters.

The aim is to construct a narrative that a film is ""Oscar worthy"".

Billboards go up, screening events are held, the stars will walk red carpets, do interviews, meet the right people.

In 2016, Susan Sarandon called for ""campaign finance reform"", saying the Oscars campaign race had become ""enormous"".

What has the Academy said about the latest controversy?

A statement released by the Academy on Friday did not reference Riseborough or To Leslie specifically.

""It is the Academy's goal to ensure that the awards competition is conducted in a fair and ethical manner, and we are committed to ensuring an inclusive awards process,"" the statement read.

""We are conducting a review of the campaign procedures around this year's nominees, to ensure that no guidelines were violated, and to inform us whether changes to the guidelines may be needed in a new era of social media and digital communication.

""We have confidence in the integrity of our nomination and voting procedures, and support genuine grassroots campaigns for outstanding performances.""

Why has this led to criticism about diversity at the Oscars?

This year, none of the best actress nominees are black.

Riseborough and Blanchett (Tar) are up for the award alongside Michelle Yeoh (Everything Everywhere All At Once), Michelle Williams (The Fabelmans) and Ana de Armas (Blonde), while strong contenders Viola Davis (The Woman King) and Danielle Deadwyler (Till) missed out.

Following the nominations announcement, Till director Chinonye Chukwu posted a statement on Instagram, saying: ""We live in a world and work in industries that are so aggressively committed to upholding whiteness and perpetuating an unabashed misogyny towards Black women.

""And yet.

""I am forever in gratitude for the greatest lesson of my life - regardless of any challenges or obstacles, I will always have the power to cultivate my own joy, and it is this joy that will continue to be one of my greatest forms of resistance.""

Read more: Brendan Fraser on the 'Bren-aissance'

Of course, Davis and Deadwyler's names being missing from the shortlist is not Riseborough's fault.

When it comes to analysis of the nominees, the nods for de Armas and Williams have also been questioned - de Armas as the Marilyn Monroe biopic Blonde has been widely panned, despite her performance being praised, and Williams as the role of Mitzi Fabelman in The Fabelmans is considered by some to be a supporting role.

But it is not just in the acting categories that the issue of diversity has come up again - not for the first time, there are no women nominated for best director. Had Chukwu been nominated, she would have been the first black woman to make the shortlist.

Sky News got the chance to ask Women Talking director Sarah Polley about the absence of female directors, as someone who could well have been in the running herself; the film has been nominated for best picture and Polley is nominated for best adapted screenplay.

""To be honest with you, the biggest disappointment for me in that category was there was an opportunity to have the first black woman ever nominated for an Oscar in the directing category and that option wasn't taken,"" she said.

""When I think about movies like Till or The Woman King or Saint Omer, there were a lot of options, so for me I think that's what I see as this missed opportunity.""

Support for Riseborough

Following the Academy's announcement, stars have spoken out in defence of Riseborough and To Leslie.

In the latest episode of his WTF podcast, her To Leslie co-star Marc Maron criticised the Academy's investigation.

""Apparently, the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences or whatever the f*** it is has decided to investigate Andrea Riseborough's grassroots campaign to get her the Oscar nomination,"" he said. ""Because I guess it so threatens their system that they're completely bought out by corporate interests in the form of studios.

""Millions of dollars [are] put into months and months of advertising campaigns, publicity, screenings by large corporate entertainment entities and Andrea was championed by her peers through a grassroots campaign which was pushed through by a few actors.

""The Academy is [like], 'Well, we gotta take a look at this. This is not the way it's supposed to work. Independent artists don't deserve the attention of the Academy unless we see how it works exactly. So, we're going to look into this'.""

Actress Christina Ricci apparently also defended Riseborough in an Instagram post, which has reportedly since been deleted. According to US entertainment site Deadline, the star wrote: ""So it's only the films and actors that can afford the campaigns that deserve recognition? Feels elitist and exclusive and frankly very backward to me.""

What happens now?

Well, it's down to the Academy to decide. Many think it's unlikely Riseborough's nomination will be withdrawn.

But even if she remains in the race, the nomination may now seem tainted - and following the initial positive reaction to her nod, voters could see her as too controversial to pick to win.

And for studios: why bother with all the promo when A-list recommendations can make even more impact?

Whether rules have been broken or not, this saga has lifted the lid on the deep pockets of awards campaigning - and how it's good promo, not necessarily just a good performance, that can turn a film or a star into a winner.

Her mobile phone was found on a bench near where she was last seen on a towpath by the River Wyre in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. It was still connected to a conference call when it was found.

Ms Bulley's dog, a springer spaniel called Willow, was found loose between the river and bench.

Police said on Tuesday that searches are continuing, adding they are ""especially keen"" to find a ""potentially key"" witness they believe was in the area at the time Ms Bulley went missing.

""He is described as a man aged around 70, white, six ft tall, well-built who was walking a small white fluffy dog on a lead,"" a Lancashire Police statement said.

""We don't know why she's gone missing, where she is, we just want her home.""

Ms White and another friend, Heather Gibbons, have been part of a widespread community search following the disappearance of Ms Bulley.

""We want to hold onto the hope that no news is good news,"" Ms Gibbons said.

""But knowing Nicky, we just know that if she could be at home with her girls we very firmly believe that is where she would be.""

""She'd do anything for anybody, she is so well-loved within the community and school community.""

Ms Gibbons added: ""It feels very surreal. You just want to wake up from it because it feels like a nightmare, that's what it is... a nightmare.""

Police said on Monday they were keeping an ""open mind"" about what happened but they do not believe Ms Bulley was attacked.

'Perpetual hell'

Ms Bulley's partner, Paul Ansell, said he spent all of Sunday searching for her.

Mr Ansell, an engineer, said: ""It is just perpetual hell. It is just utter disbelief.""

""We are living through this but it doesn't feel real,"" he said from the family home in Inskip, Lancashire.

""All we can say is we need to find her. She's got two little girls that need their mummy home.

""We have got to get some good news now.""

Ms Bulley, also known as Nikki, and Mr Ansell have been in a relationship for 12 years.

Police indicated she dropped her children, aged nine and six, to a local primary school before walking her dog on Friday.

""I got a call from the school regarding somebody who had found Willow, and Nikki's phone and the dog lead and harness on the bench,"" Mr Ansell, who then called the police, said.

Earlier on Monday, transport minister Richard Holden disputed the IMF's forecast.

Asked if the IMF is wrong, Mr Holden told Sky News: ""I think so.""

He added that the IMF has got its forecasts wrong ""in the last couple of years"", and that he thinks ""Britain can outperform its prediction like it has done for the last two years"".

The Conservative minister told Kay Burley that the UK economy has ""grown faster than Germany since 2016"" and ""grown faster than France, Italy, and Japan since 2010"".

Mr Holden also said the body's report ""praised"" the actions Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have taken to try to stabilise the country's finances.

Health Secretary Steve Barclay, talking to the Health and Social Care Committee, says NHS worker retention is ""very important"" to solving the current strikes.

He says on average the additional income, on top of an NHS worker's base salary, is 29%.

He also says pension contributions for nurses are 20% which is higher than the private sector.

The health secretary says when looking at keeping staff they need to be looking at the overall remuneration package, not just the base pay.

When asked why that approach isn't working at the moment, he says there are other pressures and ""we are recruiting more than are leaving"".

However, he said there is a time lag between training people and them being fully qualified.

Mr Barclay said they need to look at more flexibility for staff, something he said trade union bosses have paid interest to.

Lee Peacock cut the throats of 46-year-old Sharon Pickles and 59-year-old Clinton Ashmore in Westminster, central London, in August 2021.

Peacock, a self-confessed burglar and thief, had only been released from prison on 4 June 2021.

Peacock, 50, turned the 4cm-long knife on himself after a five-day manhunt led police to a houseboat, where he was hiding out.

He appeared at the Old Bailey on Tuesday, where the jury took two hours and 20 minutes to find him guilty of double murder.

He is due to be sentenced on Wednesday 1 February.

He admitted killing the pair, but had denied it was murder, claiming Ms Pickles' death was a ""pure accident"" and that Mr Ashmore had punched him in the head after he confessed to killing her.

During the trial, prosecutor Edward Brown KC described Peacock's actions as ""cold-blooded"" and ""determined"".

Kitten in a rucksack and a confession note

Jurors were told Peacock had turned up at his father's property with Ms Pickles's kitten in his rucksack on the evening of 19 August 2021. His father alerted the police that Peacock had confessed to being a killer.

Officers went to Ms Pickles' home in Marylebone and found her body wrapped up and hidden under a bed, with a signed confession nearby.

In the note, Peacock wrote that Ms Pickles was ""meant to live"" and he had sworn ""revenge"" against those who took advantage while he was in jail.

Later that day, Peacock was seen on CCTV walking with Mr Ashmore towards his Westminster flat, then leaving alone 15 minutes later.

Mr Ashmore was found dead by friends two hours later. Both victims died from similar knife wounds to the neck.

Peacock and the kitten were eventually located on 25 August and when officers arrived, he tried to cut his own neck before being restrained.

After being treated in hospital, Peacock gave a ""chilling"" account, saying he had used the same knife in both killings and the attempt on his own life.

Mortgage approvals fell to 35,600 in December, the lowest number since May 2020 and down from 46,200 in November, according to data from the Bank of England.

The figure from the central bank is lower than had been expected - a Reuters poll of economists had forecast approvals of about 45,000 during December.

If the pandemic era is excluded, house purchase approvals are at the lowest level since January 2009 when 32,400 home purchase loans were approved.

Approvals have been slow since the Liz Truss government's mini-budget, when a number of mortgage products were pulled from the market as uncertainty spooked lenders.

The figures are just the latest sign of a slowing housing market.

Prices have been coming down overall as persistent double digit inflation means the cost of living is higher, and raised interest rates - hiked by the Bank of England in an effort to slow the economy to reduce inflation - have made the cost of mortgage payments more expensive, putting off would-be buyers.

While the Bank set the interest rate to 3.5%, the latest figures found that the effective interest rate - the actual interest rate paid - on new mortgages increased by 32 percentage points, to 3.67% last month.

At the same time, mortgage debt has reduced. Tuesday's figures showed net mortgage borrowing by individuals - the total amount borrowed minus the amount repaid - decreased from £4.3bn in November to £3.2bn last month.

The signs show this figure will continue to decrease while mortgage approvals, which indicate future borrowing, were down.

Cost of living pressures on households could be seen as people also continued to borrow more than they're repaying on credit cards.

He is being held on suspicion of rape and human trafficking - allegations he denies.

It's been a whistlestop few months of controversial Twitter posts, court dates and rows with climate campaigner Greta Thunberg.

Here's what led up to Tate's arrest and what has happened since he was detained.

April 2022 - the first raid

On 11 April, Tate's home was searched by Romanian police in relation to their investigation into claims of human trafficking and rape.

Romania's Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism, known as DIICOT, has pointed to this raid as evidence their investigation has been ongoing for months, and Tate's arrest in December was not linked to the pizza boxes shown in a clapback video aimed at Greta Thunberg (more on that later).

August 2022 - social media bans

Tate is banned from Instagram, Facebook and YouTube for violating rules on ""dangerous individuals"" and breaching hate speech rules.

This brought his tally of social media bans to five. He was kicked off Twitter in 2017 (but allowed back on in November 2022) and TikTok won't let him have an account - although that hasn't stopped his videos racking up millions of views on the platform.

He relaunched himself on the streaming platform Rumble, which describes itself as ""immune to cancel culture"".

27 December 2022 - Greta Thunberg row

Tate goads climate campaigner Greta Thunberg on Twitter, sharing a picture of himself standing next to a Bugatti, boasting about his 33 cars and asking for her email address so he could send details of their ""enormous emissions"".

Ms Thunberg's reply - featuring a fake email address mocking him and ending with the words ""getalife.com"". - became one of the most-liked tweets in history.

28 December 2022 - pizza clapback video

He follows up with a video where he smokes a cigar and tells Ms Thunberg to ""get a life"". He is passed a stack of pizza boxes bearing Romanian branding, spawning the theory that the video gave away his location to police.

There is no evidence this is the case although Ms Thunberg took the opportunity for a dig, tweeting: ""This is what happens when you don't recycle your pizza boxes.""

29 December 2022 - the arrest

Tate is arrested, along with his brother Tristan and two Romanian women. They were held on suspicion of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group.

They were initially detained for 24 hours, which was then extended to 30 days. A further 30 days were added in January, allowing them to be held until 27 February.

10 January 2023 - court appearance

The Tate brothers appear in court in Bucharest. They lost their appeal against the court extending their detention.

A document explaining the judge's motivation for the extension said ""the possibility of them evading investigations cannot be ignored"" and they could ""leave Romania and settle in countries that do not allow extradition"".

Their lawyers also argued - unsuccessfully - that the court should return possessions seized during their arrest, including properties, land, and a fleet of luxury cars.

In its latest World Economic Outlook update, the IMF downgraded its UK gross domestic product (GDP) forecast once again, predicting a contraction of 0.6% against the 0.3% growth pencilled in last October.

The outlook for the year ahead puts the UK far behind its counterparts in the G7 group of advanced nations.

IMF's dire outlook for UK economy is 'wrong' - politics latest

Forecast says country's growth being held back by more miserly government spending

The UK is also expected to be the only country - across advanced and emerging economies - to suffer a year of declining GDP.

But Rishi Sunak's official spokesman told reporters that the IMF itself ""said that UK economic policy is now on the right track"" following a rocky autumn under Liz Truss' premiership.

The former prime minister caused the economy to spiral after she announced a raft of unfunded tax cuts, which eventually led to her resignation after less than two months in office.

Mr Sunak's spokesman added that the UK outperformed many forecasts last year and was ""predicted to grow faster than Germany and Japan over the coming years"".

But shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the government needs to do ""so much more"" to fulfil the potential of the UK economy.

Ms Reeves continued: ""The question people are now asking is this: are me and my family better off after 13 years of Tory government? The answer is no. And as the IMF show today, it doesn't have to be this way.""

A former adviser to Ms Truss continued to claim the ex-PM had taken the right approach to the economy, even saying the country's finances would be in a better position had her plans been followed through.

Julian Jessop, who also used to be the chief economist at the Institute of Economic Affairs, told Sky News: ""Some tax policies backfired but [Ms Truss'] overall strategy was right, and was welcomed at the time by a number of business organisations.

""We're not the only major economy with a bad outlook - Spain too. The UK was hit harder by COVID than other economies, and by the energy crisis.""

He added: ""I don't think the hit from rising energy bills will be as big as people think. We need a change in policy to tackle these problems.""

The event, which astronomers call an occultation, happened last night and was visible from parts of the US, northwestern South America, the Caribbean, and Mexico.

Similar to a lunar eclipse, when the Earth is positioned perfectly between the moon and the sun, the occultation saw the moon appear to pass in front of the red planet.

It disappeared for around an hour, and then emerged from the opposite side.

Both the moon and Mars appeared particularly bright in the night sky during the occultation.

The moon was nearly 75% illuminated, while Mars was at over 90% - helping make it visible to the naked eye.

Such lunar occultations of planets are relatively rare when compared to those involving stars.

According to the website In The Sky, which provides forecasts for these events, the moon will pass in front of Jupiter during the evening of 22 February.

It is projected to be visible from Argentina, Chile, and the Falklands.

The next lunar occultation of Mars is due on 28 February, but visibility will be limited to Greenland, the freezing Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, and parts of western Russia.

The streets are teeming with people but everywhere is shrouded in acrid smoke from piles of burning rubbish.

From the hills above Port-au-Prince, the city at times disappears in a fog of polluted air.

Wherever you walk people ask for money. Beggars trudge amid the crowds, unemployment is high and kidnapping of anyone - not just the rich - is a constant fear.

Gangs control 60% of the entire capital.

Much of the city is a no-go area, it's simply too dangerous to venture inside the territory of the hundred-or-so gangs who operate here.

The police seem powerless to break the gangs down. They patrol in masks, carrying machine guns, but they do little to stop the crime rates that have rocketed in recent years.

Civil society has been crushed by political failure.

There are no elected officials in office; the country is run by politicians with no mandate and virtually no popular support.

This country is falling apart and there is no safety net. The perverse reality is that the gangs have stepped in to fill the gap.

They offer work, protection, and security to those who welcome them.

I went to meet one of the leaders - he's arguably the most famous, and he's certainly the most vociferous.

Through a myriad of alleyways I was taken to his stronghold, surrounded by hooded armed men not wanting to show their faces on camera, I was introduced to the man known as 'Barbecue'.

'Barbecue' is actually Jimmy Cherizier, a former policeman, now gang boss who is the acknowledged mouthpiece for a coalition of gangs called the G9.

Image: Jimmy 'Barbecue' Cherizier has survived four assassination attempts

Folklore says his sobriquet comes from the way he treated his victims; his friends say it's because his mum ran a fried chicken stall and he's had the nickname since he was a child.

Either way, as he took large diamond earrings out and passed his revolver to a gunman before we could film, I decided I didn't want to find out which story was nearer the truth.

Barbecue requested we first sat down for an interview before he walked me around his territory, pretty much in the centre of Port-au-Prince.

He describes G9 as a group of armed young men and women with an ideology to change the lives of those who live in Haiti's notorious slums.

The Caribbean country has been bad for years and there is now no elected controlling authority at all.

Image: Police patrol but seem unable to break the gangs' grip

Some countries are actively considering sending in foreign soldiers to impose order, but Barbecue warns it will only end in disaster.

""If we have an intervention, the international community is understanding enough to sit down and have a decent conversation with everyone,"" he told me.

""But if they try to resolve it with guns, I think, many people in the slums could die and they will kill mostly innocent people, more than the guilty ones.""

Barbecue is a natural politician.

Many here question why at obvious moments of political vacuum he hasn't ascended the steps of the presidential palace and taken control.

There were two separate opportunities, I am told, by well-connected commentators who believe he could've grasped power - but he didn't.

He is sanctioned by the UK and its allies for ""engaging in acts threatening the peace, security and stability of Haiti"".

""I would like for one person to prove what they are accusing me of,"" Barbecue told me. ""I am a victim of a bunch of lies.""

Amongst the Haitian elite there is a view that Barbecue is in fact the pawn of a higher power.

He denies this and says he's a man of the people, and that G9 territory is home to 12 million people. ""We took up guns to change the living conditions of those less fortunate in the slums, we said it's to change their lives, we don't use guns to kidnap people,"" he insisted.

Barbecue's G9 is not known to be part of the overwhelming number of kidnappings taking place in Haiti today.

""We don't kidnap, and we don't rape. We are all fathers, we have sisters, aunts, we have kids. I have a daughter myself - I could never allow rape to happen around me.

""We don't kill for money, but we do have guns to defend ourselves, because we can't let others kill us.""

Midway through our chat, his guards a few metres up the road started messing about and laughing loudly, he was out of his seat in seconds.

His anger was clear as he told them to shut up in no uncertain terms. He returned to his seat and apologised.

For the hours we were with Barbecue he was constantly escorted by these machine-gun-toting guards.

He has survived four assassination attempts.

As we walked through his neighbourhood, people came out to greet him - some fist-pumping, others shaking his hand, many just staring.

He dispenses money and largesse. It's hard to explain but this place is like a castle and inside Barbecue is the king.

He sees himself as a revolutionary fighting against the dark corruption of government and oligarch businessmen, but he is a gang leader. And his land - like all other gangs - is always under attack.

In some parts of his territory, his enemies are only one wall away.

We watched as he inspected his fighters manning the frontline barricades. Some are just breeze block walls with gaps for them to fire through.

In other streets sheets and blankets are strung up across the roadway to obscure the view of enemy snipers. The last time I saw that was in Aleppo.

Make no mistake, Port-au-Prince is a war zone.

But the irony is, when we were filming, we were safer in the G9 gang's territory than on most of the capital's streets, where kidnapping, murder and rape are endemic. And that is something every single person lives with here every single day.

The force had put an appeal out for the man to come forward earlier on Tuesday.

He was described as about 70-years-old, and is believed to have been in the area at the time Ms Bulley went missing.

In a statement, Ms Bulley's family said: ""We have been overwhelmed by the support from our community and would like to thank everyone for their ongoing efforts to help us find Nicola.

""The girls are desperate to have their mummy back home safe with them and your ongoing efforts have provided comfort to them whilst we await news on Nicola.""

The 45-year-old mother of two was last seen at 9.15am on Friday by a member of the public.

Her mobile phone was found on a bench near where she was last seen on a towpath by the River Wyre in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. It was still connected to a conference call when it was found.

Ms Bulley's dog, a springer spaniel called Willow, was found loose between the river and bench.

A search of the area involving police specialist resources, working alongside colleagues from the Coastguard and Bowland Mountain Rescue, is continuing, the force said.

Officers have said they are ""extremely concerned"" for Ms Bulley's welfare, but stressed that the investigation still remained a missing person inquiry and there is nothing, at the moment, to suggest third-party involvement in her disappearance.

'We just want her home'

Friends of Ms Bulley have told Sky News ""we just want her home"".

Emma White said: ""We've got two little girls wanting their mummy, so if anyone has any information please just come forward.""

She described Ms Bulley as ""the kindest, beautiful, lovely human being inside and out"", adding that her partner, Paul, was ""being strong as possible"" for the couple's two children, aged nine and six.

""We don't know why she's gone missing, where she is, we just want her home,"" she said.

Image: Map showing where Nicola Bulley went missing

Ms White and another friend, Heather Gibbons, have been part of a widespread community search following the disappearance of Ms Bulley.

""We want to hold on to the hope that no news is good news,"" Ms Gibbons said.

""But knowing Nicky, we just know that if she could be at home with her girls we very firmly believe that is where she would be.""

""She'd do anything for anybody, she is so well-loved within the community and school community.""

Ms Gibbons added: ""It feels very surreal. You just want to wake up from it because it feels like a nightmare, that's what it is... a nightmare.""

Police said on Monday they were keeping an ""open mind"" about what happened, but they do not believe Ms Bulley was attacked.

'Perpetual hell'

Ms Bulley's partner, Paul Ansell, said he spent all of Sunday searching for her.

Mr Ansell, an engineer, said: ""It is just perpetual hell. It is just utter disbelief.""

""We are living through this but it doesn't feel real,"" he said from the family home in Inskip, Lancashire.

""All we can say is we need to find her. She's got two little girls that need their mummy home.

""We have got to get some good news now.""

Ms Bulley, also known as Nikki, and Mr Ansell have been in a relationship for 12 years.

Police indicated she dropped her children at a local primary school before walking her dog on Friday.

""I got a call from the school regarding somebody who had found Willow, and Nikki's phone and the dog lead and harness on the bench,"" Mr Ansell, who then called the police, said.

""We take the kids to school and take the dog down there - either myself or Nikki - nearly every day.""

Ms Bulley, a mortgage adviser, is originally from Chelmsford, Essex and has lived in Lancashire for 25 years. Police said she speaks with an Essex accent.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131172509/http://news.sky.com/story/potentially-key-witness-to-disappearance-of-dog-walker-nicola-bulley-found-as-friends-tell-of-nightmare-12799850;5

A former teacher from Birmingham has criticised striking teachers, saying looking after his children while they are off school will cost him £250 in missed earnings.

""Both our children's teachers are striking in a junior school which means both of them need childcare,"" Mr Long said.

The 42-year-old French actress had been due to play the lead role in A Patriot, appearing alongside Charles Dance and Helen Hunt, but the production was cancelled in October 2019.

Green, best known for starring in Casino Royale alongside Daniel Craig, has filed a lawsuit against producers White Lantern Film, claiming she is still entitled to her fee of $1m (about £810,000) despite the project collapsing.

In turn, White Lantern Film is bringing a counterclaim against the French actress, claiming she undermined the independent film's production, made ""excessive creative and financial demands"" and had expectations that were ""incompatible"" with the film's budget. They have accused her of wanting to get out of the project.

The court has previously heard how in text messages, Green referred to one of the film's executive producers, Jake Seal, as a ""devious sociopath"", ""pure vomit"" and ""a liar and a mad man"". However, her barrister has said that White Lantern's claim is ""designed to paint my client as a diva to win headlines and damage her reputation"".

On Monday, she blamed her ""Frenchness"" for some of her messages.

Giving evidence for the second day on Tuesday, the star answered more questions about her messages. Max Mallin, representing White Lantern Film, asked Green about a message describing Seal as ""evil"", which also said that she had to ""get out"" of the film.

She denied this meant she wanted to withdraw from the project. ""If I really wanted to pull out, I would have asked my agent to do so in a legal way,"" she said.

""Are you accustomed to simply lying in casual WhatsApp messages?"" Mr Mallin asked.

Green said she had a ""very direct way of saying things"". She continued: ""I was not expecting to have my WhatsApp messages exposed in court, it's very humiliating. Sometimes you say things you don't mean.

""You say you hate a person and you say, 'I'm going to kill this person'. Are you going to kill this person? No. It's a cry from the heart.""

Craig, 54, made the comment in an interview in 2015 after finishing his penultimate Bond film Spectre.

He later accepted the remark made him appear ""ungrateful"" but said it was meant to be a joke - and went on to star in his final 007 film, No Time To Die, in 2021.

George Santos has resisted calls for his resignation as a member of the US House of Representatives after it emerged he fabricated claims about his background.

Amid increasing pressure to step down, he has now announced that he will be ""temporarily rescued from committee assignments"".

""With the ongoing attention surrounding both my personal and campaign financial investigations, I have submitted a request to Speaker McCarthy that I be temporarily recused from my committee assignments until I am cleared,"" he said in a statement.

""This was a decision that I take very seriously. The business of the 118th Congress must continue without media fanfare.

""It is important that I primarily focus on serving the constituents of New York's Third Congressional District and providing federal level representation without distraction.""

""To my constituents, I remain committed to serving the district, and delivering results for both New York's Third Congressional District and for the American people.""

The 34-year-old House of Representatives member had been given positions on congressional committees for science and small business.

Mr Santos was elected to the House of Representatives in November, but his short career in office has been dogged by continued revelations of falsehoods in his self-penned backstory.

On top of persistent questions about falsehoods surrounding his past employment, education, and family background, Mr Santos is facing separate investigations into his financial affairs and campaign finances.

Image: People demonstrate against Santos

What claims has Santos made?

He claimed his grandparents survived the holocaust, but genealogical research found no evidence they had Jewish ancestry. Mr Santos subsequently claimed never to have claimed to be Jewish, only ""Jew-ish"".

He said his mother was in the World Trade Centre during the 9/11 attacks, but immigration records show she wasn't in the country at the time.

His claim to have been a Wall Street banker has been discredited by the employers he listed on his CV.

He said he was a volleyball star at New York's Baruch College, but it said it had no record of him.

Drag performers in Brazil say they remember Mr Santos as a drag queen, named Kitara Ravache. When questioned, Mr Santos told reporters he merely had ""fun at a festival"".

Targeting disaffected Brexit voters with a new plan to make it work is Reform UK - formerly the Brexit Party - now with Richard Tice instead of Nigel Farage at the helm.

Mr Tice is running to be the MP in the North East constituency of Hartlepool for the second time. It's a left-behind, Leave-voting town, typical of the areas where the party has previously done well.

And he's got 2019 Tory voters in his sights.

Politics latest: Brexit has been 'tricky', Cleverly admits

Speaking to Sky News today, he said: ""The country's broken, nothing works, and people are looking around and saying, 'what has happened? why is it like this?'

""We need change and that's what Reform UK is, I mean it's literally in the name.

""And we're saying, the country has so much potential, Brexit gave us that massive opportunity, but the Tories haven't taken advantage of it.""

The party has pledged to stand candidates in every seat across the country, but the reality of the first-past-the-post voting system in the UK means its impact could be limited to certain areas.

Pollster James Johnson told Sky News that although the party had very little chance of winning a seat, they could wound the Conservatives in key battlegrounds.

He said: ""In lots of the seats the Conservatives won in 2019 and [which] they are looking to hold on to - especially in the North and Midlands, places that voted Leave - it could be, on current polling, that Reform UK hurts the Conservatives in those seats.""

Image: Hartlepool is a former Labour seat, but was won by the Conservatives for the first time in a by-election in 2021

But he added: ""One word of warning … we saw this in 2015. Everybody was saying the polling showed in 2015 that UKIP, Nigel Farage would hurt the Conservatives more than Labour, and in the end they ended up taking votes away from Labour too.

""And although we're not seeing that happening in the polling at the moment… you could see that happening and that's dangerous for Keir Starmer because what Labour is relying on is winning back those voters that they lost last time around.""

In an attempt to move beyond Brexit and widen its appeal, Reform UK has launched a raft of new policies, from cutting taxes for people earning less than £20,000 to reducing NHS waiting lists to zero.

But speaking to some of its supporters in Hartlepool, there is still one main policy that is winning them support - reducing immigration.

Ian Griffiths, who owns a printing shop in the town and described himself as a swing voter, said he was drawn to Reform's stance on the issue.

Image: Ian Griffiths said he approved of Reform UK's position on immigration

""I'm against these massive numbers coming in now,"" he said, ""and it seems as though they can just come in willy-nilly and it is causing havoc with the NHS, causing havoc because of the amount of money it's costing the country"".

""We just can't afford it right now, millions if not billions in accommodation costs for people that are fleeing countries that are not at war.""

Others told us they didn't know much about the party but that they were fed up with both the Conservatives and Labour, and were open to a change.

With two years until the next general election, Richard Tice and Reform are already starting to have a small but increasingly significant impact.

Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, told Sky News that the hardest fighting was yet to come and said the next few months would be crucial in deciding the course of the war.

He urged western allies to send more weapons, including Royal Air Force Typhoon jets from the UK and fighter aircraft from other partners.

""Russia is preparing for maximum escalation,"" Mr Danilov said in an interview on Tuesday at his headquarters in the capital Kyiv.

""It is gathering everything possible, doing drills and training.""

He did not rule out the possibility that President Vladimir Putin attempts another attack from the north, south and east, as happened on 24 February 2022 - maybe even to coincide with the anniversary.

""We do understand everything is on the table… I can say that we are not excluding any scenario in the next two to three weeks.""

He said that Ukraine's military was preparing for all possibilities and this time around had significantly more support from western partners such as the UK than 12 months ago.

""Those countries who help us in our struggle have started to provide us maximum help.""

""Traditionally they [Russia] have tried to do things on dates. The Ukrainians come from a similar culture as well in that regard, but I haven't seen anything from either side to suggest they do have plans afoot.""

Mr Danilov said he expected about half of more than 320,000 soldiers mobilised by Russia last September would be involved in the second wave whenever it came.

The first half of the manpower have already been deployed to Ukraine to replenish Russian lines after Moscow's invading forces suffered significant losses.

Ukraine has also paid a heavy price in military personnel and civilians killed and wounded.

'Bloodier days to come'

Yet the top security official predicted even bloodier days ahead.

""Of course. We went through an extensive difficult period, but I'm conscious the main fights are yet to come and they will happen this year, within two to three months. These will be defining months in the war,"" Mr Danilov said.

It is why the Ukrainians are desperate for their western partners to send more lethal weapons and faster.

They have secured tanks - belatedly - and are now after fast jets.

""It would be great if they were [RAF] Typhoon jets. F-16s are also good,"" Mr Danilov said.

""Any help would be good.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:13 What's the situation on the ground in Ukraine?

It is not just Russian forces rearming and preparing to go on the attack.

""We have our own plans and they are clear to us,"" Mr Danilov said - but they are secret.

93;93;2987;2987;Alec Baldwin charged with involuntary manslaughter over fatal shooting on Rust film set;Tuesday 31 January 2023 20:54, UK;[];['alec baldwin', 'halyna hutchins', 'new mexico'];['rust', 'fatal', 'set', 'alec', 'charges', 'involuntary', 'charged', 'shooting', 'live', 'fe', 'announced', 'film', 'manslaughter', 'safety', 'baldwin'];"Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin has been charged with involuntary manslaughter over the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the western film Rust.

Baldwin has vowed to fight the charges against him, with his lawyer calling the case a ""terrible miscarriage of justice"".

Halyna Hutchins, 42, died after a prop gun held by the 64-year-old star was discharged during rehearsals for the movie in October 2021.

Her family welcomed the charges when they were announced earlier in January, saying Baldwin showed ""conscious disregard for human life"".

Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was responsible for weapons on the Rust set, has also been charged with involuntary manslaughter, while assistant director Dave Halls has signed a plea agreement for the charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon.

The decision on charges was made about three months after prosecutors received the final report on the shooting from the Santa Fe sheriff's office, following a lengthy investigation also involving the FBI.

Special prosecutor Andrea Reeb said at the time: ""If any one of these three people - Alec Baldwin, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed or David Halls - had done their job, Halyna Hutchins would be alive today. It's that simple.

""The evidence clearly shows a pattern of criminal disregard for safety on the Rust film set. In New Mexico, there is no room for film sets that don't take our state's commitment to gun safety and public safety seriously.""

Santa Fe's district attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies added: ""No one is above the law, and everyone deserves justice.""

Baldwin and the Rust production company reached a civil settlement for an undisclosed amount with Hutchins's family in October and announced that production of the film would resume this year. After the criminal charges were announced, the film's lawyer confirmed Baldwin would remain in the lead role in the film.

Hutchins's husband Matt will also remain executive producer - and Joel Souza, who was injured in the shooting, is returning as director.

A number of other lawsuits have also been filed in relation to the shooting.

Hutchins died on the set outside Sante Fe, New Mexico, when a revolver Baldwin was rehearsing with, fired with a live bullet.

Baldwin has denied responsibility for the shooting - saying live ammunition should never have been allowed on set and weapons handlers were responsible for firearm safety.

An investigation by Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office has yet to reveal how live rounds got onto the film set in the first place.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131205842/http://news.sky.com/story/alec-baldwin-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-over-fatal-shooting-on-rust-film-set-12799967;5

At Hazel Community Primary School in Leicester, headteacher Daniel Hansen has made the decision to close to all pupils.

He supports the majority of staff who plan to strike, and is making sure the walkout has maximum impact by not even providing childcare.

Instead, lunch boxes will be made available for pupils entitled to free school meals to collect from the site.

""I think there are two key elements of this,"" Mr Hansen said. ""There's the funded pay increase that we want for teachers that matches inflation.

""A huge element is the fact that we have to protect the education sector and the teaching profession going forward.

""We have to do something about it, otherwise nobody will want to become a teacher.""

At the school gate, many parents supported his decision, but others were concerned about who would look after their children as the UK faces the biggest day of industrial action in more than a decade with teachers, university staff, train drivers, civil servants, bus drivers and security guards all taking action.

Rachel Badzire has never been on strike before and, as a teacher in a special school in Cheshire, she has found the decision to walk out difficult.

'Enough is enough'

""I love my children that I teach, and I think it's a worthwhile job, however I do feel at this point in time it's good for me to join with other members of my union and show solidarity,"" she said.

""We need to put a message out to the government that enough is enough. We don't have much money, and we need to make sure that we can pay bills and still have a life"".

At Cockshut Hill Secondary School in Birmingham, they've decided to open to year 11 pupils who have their GCSE exams in the coming months as well as the youngest year group, year 7.

Any other pupils who are vulnerable will be allowed in, but the majority of pupils will have to remain at home.

Luca Duggan and Aya Seid are among the pupils who face a day of online learning. They're both in year 10.

'I'm a little stressed about it'

Luca, 14, said: ""We get a break off school, but then that may affect our learning, but we've got online learning so not too much to worry about really.""

He added it feels ""similar"" to time off during the pandemic, and said he supports teachers ""to an extent"".

""I feel like if that's what they're going to have to do to get the pay, then that's what they're going to have to do.""

Aya, 14, is more concerned. ""It is quite a shame that we don't get the education that we need,"" she said.

""I am a little stressed about it. In school each lesson contains so much knowledge and so much information that could help us get a few extra marks to get a grade 9 in GCSE, but even though we are at home we are getting lots of work to do.""

'Get around the table and seek a resolution'

Vince Green, the CEO of the Summit Learning Trust that runs Cockshut Hill and seven other schools, is urging the government and unions to reach an agreement so that further planned strikes don't happen.

""From my point of view we don't want disruption to the learning of children and young people particularly after the levels of disruption that they've had in recent years through no fault of their own,"" he said.

""What I'd really like to see if that the adults involved get around the table and seek a resolution prior to next month.""

""We are still negotiating and discussing issues of pay, of workload, and other issues that are of concern to teachers,"" he said.

They sounded exasperated about a two-page spread in one of the papers about the Princess of Wales's eyebrows.

Just her eyebrows. Can you imagine living that life where every part of your appearance is picked apart, and often overshadows what you have to say.

This week it's clear the Princess of Wales and her team want to do everything they can to get past that.

This is her week where she wants to start a national conversation ""to revolutionise the way the UK thinks about those early years of a child's life"" and ""to make this her life's work"", a palace source told me.

In cinemas, on billboards, on social media, and from celebrity ambassadors, you'll see campaign material for ""Shaping Us"".

The research makes the compelling case that as a society we simply don't focus enough on what we can all do - not just parents - to help children in those first five years in life to thrive and become happy healthy adults.

But as Kate was surrounded by cameras and crowds in Kirkgate Market in Leeds, the location for the launch of the campaign, it felt like there was something missing.

This didn't feel like the urgent call to action she wants it to be.

Princess of Wales launches childhood campaign - but faces calls for long-term investment instead

Kate is competing against a lot of noise, and I don't mean just in the market, but in society generally.

At a time when so many families are struggling with the cost of living crisis, when day-to-day worries are centered around heating their homes and feeding their children, this needs to be a campaign that grabs you and I'm not sure that it does at the moment.

She wants us all to wake up to the fact that we can play a part in making sure children don't fall through the net, but how do you make people care when they're struggling enough with their own problems?

In the past few months, I've been on a number of Kate's early years' visits. I've seen firsthand that she undoubtedly cares and she knows her stuff.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:18 The Princess of Wales at her campaign launch

During one visit she told an expert to keep sending over the research because she loves the science, the same day she repeatedly kept talking about the importance of communities doing more to support each other.

From toddlers to nursery staff to academics she makes people feel listened to, she wants to find out what is happening on the ground.

And it's not just because she has three children herself.

For over a decade she's been focusing on the links between early childhood and things like addiction, and getting experts in the room to figure out how she can use her platform to have the maximum impact.

""Shaping Us"" is her way of showing you what she wants to do as the new Princess of Wales.

Don't forget she is more constrained than other campaigners; as a royal she can't be seen to be lobbying, even though the provision of childhood services and the cost of childcare are deeply political issues.

But her challenge now is how to get her message to really punch through.

This morning the front pages focused on the red suit she was wearing at a BAFTA event on Monday.

Last week, on the day she met with leading childcare and paediatric experts who'll be helping her with this project, a headline on Twitter read: ""Princess Kate's black outfit and glossy blow-dry just turned everyone's head.""

As her team would say ""societal change doesn't happen overnight"" - that also seems to count for the way Kate's work is covered and the media's obsession with how she looks.

But above all else, we keep hearing that the princess wants us to know she's committed to this for the long haul.

For her, this is just the start of a vital conversation with the nation.

Announcing the news on Instagram, the 23-year-old shared a photo of her week-old baby laying in a crib in a nursery that featured the name Bambi in light-up lettering on the wall.

It was simply captioned with her daughter's name, followed by a white love heart.

Although the post initially allowed users to comment, the function later disappeared – suggesting Hague had opted to turn them off.

Her partner and father to Bambi, Tommy Fury, didn't post a name announcement on his feed at the same time, but did share a sweet message and photo on his Instagram story.

""The best mummy in the entire world. Watching how you take care of Bambi makes me love you more than I knew I could,"" he wrote, sharing a picture of Hague and their baby in hospital.

""You're everything I could have ever dreamed of for a mum and role model for our perfect girl. Thank you for making my dreams come true babe, I love you.""

The chancellor was confronted at a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee on the same day a grim economic forecast put him under more pressure to cut taxes.

Leading the onslaught demanding tax cuts was the veteran Thatcherite ex-minister Sir Edward Leigh, who told Mr Hunt voters were depressed by the cost of living crisis.

No 10 insists UK economy is strong despite IMF warning it will fare worse than any other in developed world

Sir Edward, a leading Brexiteer who was sacked by Sir John Major for opposing the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, called on the chancellor to cut corporation tax, income and fuel duty.

He told Sky News after the meeting: ""I said 'you can't wait until the general election. People are depressed. You've got to give them hope.'

""You've got to say: 'We made the right decisions in September, therefore that's given me room in this budget to cut taxes, whether it's corporation, personal or fuel'.""

The chancellor was challenged directly on fuel duty during the meeting by Red Wall MP Jonathan Gullis, a leading campaigner on the issue, amid fears of a 12p-a-litre hike in the Budget on March 15.

A disappointed Mr Gullis told Sky News: ""He told me: 'We'll have to see how the public finances are at the time'.""

Other MPs present also left the meeting alarmed that Mr Hunt failed to rule out an increase.

But loyalist backbencher David Simmonds, describing the meeting, said: ""Everyone agrees that tackling inflation is the short-term priority and that there will be a return to a tax-cutting agenda once inflation is under control.

""He also spoke about the big reduction in business rates that's coming in April and the impact that will have on small businesses.""

Asked about the mood in the meeting, Mr Simmonds said: ""It was very positive, actually. People are very serious because the challenge of inflation is a big one, but at the same time there's a good window of opportunity to get it right. People see that.""

Defence spending

Mr Hunt's appearance at the committee came only hours after the International Monetary Fund published a damning report blaming weakness in the UK economy on higher taxes and rising interest rates.

But there was surprise among some of the Tory MPs attending the 80-minute meeting that none of those present called for an increase in defence spending in the chancellor's Budget.

This week Sky News revealed that a US general said the UK was no longer a top-level fighting force because of defence cuts and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace admitted the armed forces had been ""hollowed out"" by the Tories.

Mr Hunt was in a jocular mood as he arrived at the meeting, held in a Commons committee room.

Asked by Sky News if he was nervous, he clenched his fists and replied: ""Quaking!"" As he left, he said, laughing, that it had been: ""Gruelling! Tough!""

Among the MPs present was former Prime Minister Theresa May, who in 2018 promoted Mr Hunt to foreign secretary when Boris Johnson resigned.

101;101;2998;2998;Treasury reveals 'world-first' proposals to regulate cryptocurrency;Tuesday 31 January 2023 22:46, UK;[];['cryptocurrencies'];['reveals', 'industry', 'sky', 'proposals', 'told', 'investors', 'seen', 'regulation', 'worlds', 'worldfirst', 'cryptocurrency', 'regulate', 'treasury', 'crypto', 'plans'];"The Treasury has revealed proposals to regulate cryptocurrency, following widespread calls for action after the spectacular collapse of one of the world's largest trading exchanges.

Promising a ""robust"" approach to digital assets consistent with traditional finance, the government says it wants exchanges to have fairer and tighter standards.

Under the plans, crypto platforms would become responsible for defining the demands that a currency must meet before being admitted for trading.

Exchanges will also be held accountable for safely facilitating transactions and keeping customer assets safe.

It comes after the deputy governor of the Bank of England told Sky News that crypto trading is ""too dangerous"" to remain outside mainstream regulation.

Speaking in light of the sudden bankruptcy of crypto platform FTX, Sir Jon Cunliffe described the market as ""incredibly volatile"" and said investors needed more protection.

Some 80,000 UK-based customers were impacted by the collapse of the world's second-largest crypto exchange, with one British investor left with a £1m hole in his finances.

FTX's disgraced founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, has since pleaded not guilty to stealing billions of dollars in customer money.

Are the government's plans sufficient?

The proposals - which Labour said had arrived too far too late - come as the crypto industry seeks to regain the confidence of spooked investors.

Since FTX collapsed, wider market turmoil has seen Bitcoin, the world's biggest token, fall to a five-month low and major exchange Coinbase cut 20% of its workforce.

Less than a year ago, Rishi Sunak, then chancellor, said he wanted the UK to be a ""global crypto asset hub"".

Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government was still committed to enabling crypto, but stressed the need to ""protect consumers who are embracing this new technology"".

The plans will first be submitted to a consultation, but the Treasury claims the regulation will be a ""world first"", suggesting it should arrive before the EU's expected crypto legislation in 2024.

In the meantime, the Treasury announced it would be introducing a time-limited exemption to let more crypto asset companies issue promotions following a crackdown on ""misleading"" adverts.

Firms that are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority for anti-money laundering purposes will be allowed to while the broader regulation is being introduced.

'We've been waiting a long time'

Crypto fraud expert Louise Abbott, a partner at Keystone Law, welcomed the proposals.

She told Sky News that the lack of regulation in crypto made it ""hugely attractive to fraudsters"".

""We have been waiting in this industry for a long time,"" she said.

""I deal with fraud and have seen a dramatic increase in crypto scams and fraud in the past 10 years. Last year, I was getting daily enquiries from potential victims who have been defrauded through a crypto scam.""

Ms Abbot hopes the regulation could be in place as soon as the summer, adding that it was in the interests of both exchanges and investors for greater oversight of the market.

Major industry players including Binance chief Changpeng Zhao, who saw his platform banned in the UK in 2021, and Coinbase's Brian Armstrong have previously welcomed the prospect of more regulation.

""Unless we become a safer environment, investors will not invest in the way we have seen,"" Ms Abbot added.

Varun Paul, former head of fintech at the Bank of England, now of crypto infrastructure provider Fireblocks, also described the plans as a ""positive step"".

He told Sky News that industry turmoil meant there was a need for ""clear rules"", and expressed hope that the UK's regulation would do the job while still encouraging innovation.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131225936/http://news.sky.com/story/treasury-reveals-world-first-proposals-to-regulate-cryptocurrency-12799964;6

General secretary Mark Serwotka said the move would ""impact on people returning from their holidays"", but said the ""blame"" for the action ""lies firmly at the feet of ministers who are refusing to put any money on the table"".

A Home Office spokesperson said they were ""extremely disappointed"" with the decision and warned travellers to ""be prepared for disruption"".

This latest strike announcement comes ahead of mass industrial actions across several sectors on Wednesday, which will include teachers, train drivers and civil servants.

And it is the second walkout by Border Force staff after it staged strikes in airports across Christmas.

During that action, the government brought in military personnel to plug the gaps, and it is understood they will do so again, alongside civil servants and volunteers.

Mr Serwokta warned that the military would not be able to fill in for the ""highly-skilled and experienced officers"" in French ports, however.

The union boss criticised the government for failing to move on its pay offer, adding: ""They say they will talk about money for next year, but our members - who have been offered just a 2% rise at a time when inflation is around 10% - cannot afford to wait for next year.

""Many civil servants are already having to choose between heating and eating, having to claim the benefits they themselves have to administer and they are having to go to foodbanks.

""Ministers should be ashamed at how they treat their own workforce and until they come to the table with money for our members, we will continue to call strike action, with tomorrow's strike being a key part of what will be a continuous, sustained, targeted campaign.""

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We are extremely disappointed with the union's decision to strike and the inconvenience this will cause to travellers and businesses.

""We continue to work closely with all affected ports to assess the impacts of this announcement. Whilst we have robust plans in place to minimise any delays, passengers should be prepared for disruption and take action to plan ahead.

""Those intending to travel or ship goods into the UK over strike days should keep up-to-date with the latest advice from operators to check how the strike action will affect them.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131225936/http://news.sky.com/story/1-000-border-force-officers-to-go-on-strike-for-four-days-during-february-half-term-pcs-union-announces-12800134;1

Baldwin has vowed to fight the two counts against him, with his lawyer calling the case a ""terrible miscarriage of justice"".

A live round killed Halyna Hutchins, 42, after a prop gun held by the 64-year-old star was discharged during rehearsals for the movie in October 2021.

The charges - which could see Baldwin sent to jail for up to five years - would require prosecutors to convince a jury that Baldwin was not just negligent but reckless in his use of a firearm.

Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was responsible for weapons on the Rust set, has also been charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter.

Legal experts have said prosecutors will struggle to win convictions without proof Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed knew live ammunition was present but took no precautions.

In a statement of probable cause of Hutchins's death, the Santa Fe District Attorney listed several problems with Baldwin's conduct.

They said:

Baldwin was not present for required firearms training

After failing to show up to this training, he received a 30-minute on-set training during which he was distracted talking to his family on the phone

He exhibited ""reckless behaviour"" in the lead up to Hutchins's death

He had pointed the firearm at Hutchins in the lead up to the incident violating gun safety rules

Baldwin had not performed the required safety checks with Gutierrez-Reed

He broke protocol by letting Gutierrez-Reed leave the church set

He did not deal with safety complaints on set

He did not use a replica firearm for the unscheduled rehearsal

He allowed the hiring of Gutierrez-Reed, who had worked on just one production before the movie, which showed he ""failed to demand the minimum safety standards, protocols, and requirements on set""

The District Attorney also said that on the day of the shooting, there were ""no less than a dozen acts, or omissions of recklessness"" on the set before the incident, not including the actor's handling of the gun.

""Baldwin's deviation from known standards, practice and protocol directly caused the fatal death of Hutchins,"" the District Attorney said.

Both Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will be required to appear in court - in person or virtually - within 30 days.

The District Attorney and special prosecutor will then present their case to the judge, who will rule whether there is probable cause to move forward with a trial.

Hutchins's family welcomed the charges when they were announced earlier in January, saying Baldwin showed ""conscious disregard for human life"".

Rust assistant director Dave Halls is facing negligent use of a deadly weapon charges. He has pleaded no contest and has entered into a plea agreement that is pending approval.

Industry-wide firearms safety guidelines instruct actors to assume a firearm is loaded with blanks and rely on professional weapons handlers to ensure a weapon is safe.

Actors are told to only point a weapon at a person under the guidance of firearms professionals. Live ammunition is strictly forbidden on sets.

Gutierrez-Reed said she checked the rounds she loaded in the revolver were dummies before handing it to Halls.

Image: Baldwin pictured in New York as the charges were due to formally be filed

Halls handed it to Baldwin, telling him it was a ""cold gun"" or unloaded, according to police.

Gutierrez-Reed's lawyer, Jason Bowles, said: ""Hannah pleaded to provide more firearms training. She was denied and brushed aside.""

He added: ""We will fight these charges and expect that a jury will find Hannah not guilty.""

The decision on charges was made about three months after prosecutors received the final report on the shooting from the Santa Fe sheriff's office, following a lengthy investigation also involving the FBI.

The sheriff's office investigation has yet to reveal how live ammunition got onto the set.

Baldwin and the Rust production company reached a civil settlement for an undisclosed amount with Hutchins's family in October and announced that production of the film would resume this year. After the criminal charges were announced, the film's lawyer confirmed Baldwin would remain in the lead role in the film.

The 19-year-old disappeared on her way to work at a finance company in Milton Keynes on 15 February 2019.

A murder investigation was launched last week after the discovery of the remains in a house in the city in Buckinghamshire.

A post mortem examination last week did not uncover her cause of death and investigations are continuing, police said.

Items belonging to Ms Croucher were also found in the property in Loxbeare Drive, Furzton, which is a few minutes away from her home.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Superintendent Kevin Brown, head of the major crime unit at Thames Valley Police, said: ""After a difficult process, we are now in a position to formally confirm that the body found in Loxbeare Drive last week is that of Leah.""

Ms Croucher's family continue to be supported by specially trained officers and updated on every development, Det Supt Brown said.

Last week Ms Croucher's parents, Claire and John, laid flowers at the property where her remains were found.

They said they would ""cherish her memories forever"", writing in a message: ""Our darkest fears have come true, we only need to be apart a little longer. We have so missed you for so long already.

""The future looks so bleak now we know we will never see your smile or hear your laughter again. We will cherish your memories forever. We love you. Mum and Dad xx xx"".

Her grandparents also left roses near the house, along with a handwritten note saying: ""Our darling, we will never stop seeking answers. Will love and miss you always.""

Missed opportunities to arrest prime suspect

Convicted sex offender Neil Maxwell was named by police this month as the prime suspect in the murder inquiry.

He was found dead on 20 April 2019 after taking his own life.

Police started searching the property on 10 October this year after receiving a tip-off from a member of the public.

Officers had visited the house on two earlier occasions but insisted this was the first time Ms Croucher's disappearance was linked to the address - despite conducting about 4,000 house-to-house calls.

They changed their investigation from a missing person's probe to a murder inquiry after discovering the remains.

Image: Neil Maxwell

It has since emerged Maxwell was the only person with keys to the house, which was unoccupied when police were conducting their inquiries.

He was wanted in connection with a sexual assault and used false names and changed his mobile phone and vehicles to avoid police.

The force made a total of 18 attempts to arrest Maxwell - initially at an address in Milton Keynes on 30 November 2018.

Police said if he was alive today, they would be seeking to arrest him.

Mr Brown added: ""Our investigations into Leah's murder will leave no stone unturned and we owe it to Leah's family to ensure we find the truth.""

Train drivers from the RMT and Aslef unions are also staging another strike as a long-running dispute over pay and conditions rumbles on - with university lecturers, bus drivers and security guards taking action too.

About 123 government departments are set to be disrupted by industrial action as well.

Protests are due to be held across the country against the government's controversial plans for a new law on minimum service levels during strikes.

Downing Street has conceded that today's mass strike action will be ""very difficult"" for the public.

The prime minister's official spokesman said it is ""disappointing"" that headteachers do not know fully how many teachers will be available for work until later today.

Union bosses continue to argue with employers for higher pay rises to combat record high inflation and real-term cuts over the past decade.

The latest research from the TUC suggests that the average public sector worker is more than £200 a month worse off compared with a decade ago.

But ministers continue to insist increasing wages to that level would fuel inflation, and its top priority was to cut that down over the coming weeks and months.

More strikes are expected next week and will be dominated by NHS staff, with both nurses and ambulance workers planning action.

NHS consultants in England are also preparing for possible strike action.

And the following week will see Border Force officers at four ports strike over four days in the February half-term.

Scale of school strikes revealed

Some schools may only open to certain year groups as a result of today's industrial action.

Liverpool City Council is expecting 38% of schools to be closed, with 54% only partially open, based on returns from 130 of around 160 schools in the city.

Meanwhile, Norfolk County Council said they had already been informed of 121 partial closures and 29 full closures across schools.

The NEU's joint general secretary, Kevin Courtney, said he and his members ""sincerely regret"" the impact this will cause to a child's education and routine, but warned: ""We're pointing to disruption that is happening every day in schools.

""If we don't persuade government to invest in education that disruption just carries on.""

While a 5% pay rise has been offered to most teachers - covering the current school year - the NEU is demanding a fully funded, above-inflation pay rise.

Today marks the first of seven days of NEU strike action across February and March, but Mr Courtney hopes a deal can be reached before further walkouts take place.

In a boost for teachers and employers, the start-up that created ChatGPT - OpenAI - now offers a way of determining content produced using artificial intelligence.

Announcing the news in a blog post, the platform said the AI Text Classifier will categorise text on a five-step scale - raging from likely to very unlikely.

OpenAI said the tool is a ""fine-tuned GPT model that predicts how likely it is that a piece of text was generated by AI from a variety of sources"".

It said: ""We're making this classifier publicly available to get feedback on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful.

""We recognise that identifying AI-written text has been an important point of discussion among educators, and equally important is recognising the limits and impacts of AI generated text classifiers in the classroom.""

In its public beta mode, OpenAI acknowledges the detection tool is very unreliable on texts under 1,000 characters - about 150 to 250 words.

Prices are now 8% higher than they were last January, up from 7.3% in December and above the three-month average of 7.5%, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC)-NielsenIQ Shop Price Index.

Overall food inflation rose to 13.8% from 13.3% in December - the highest inflation rate in the category on record.

Inflation on fresh food has also reached a record high, due to increased food production costs, as well as elevated fruit and vegetable prices - which rose from 11% to 11.3% in December.

Ambient food inflation saw the fastest increase on record - from 11.3% from 11% in December - as wholesale and bulk prices rose, particularly for sugar and alcohol.

Meanwhile, clothing and footwear prices eased, which meant shoppers will have been able to restock their wardrobes during the January sales.

BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""Retail prices rose in January as discounting slowed and retailers continued to face high input costs.

""With global food costs coming down from their 2022 high and the cost of oil falling, we expect to see some inflationary pressures easing.

""However, as retailers still face ongoing headwinds from rising energy bills and labour shortages, prices are yet to peak and will likely remain high in the near term as a result.""

Premier League clubs spent about £650m combined on strengthening squads for the second half of the season.

Teams in the next biggest leagues - Spain, Italy, Germany and France - spent less than £200m combined.

Image: Pic: AP

It's an indicator of the wealth of English football, underpinned by television income (of which Sky News owner Comcast is a large contributor).

Splashing the cash so freely reflects the desire for instant success. Particularly at Chelsea.

No club has spent more in a year than the Blues - £600m. Half has been splurged in the January window - more than spending in the rest of Europe combined.

Before the transfer window closed last night, Chelsea were still able to break the British transfer record with the £106.8m signing of Enzo Fernandez from Benfica.

The 22-year-old would barely have registered on the radar, even of football fans, until winning the World Cup with Argentina in December.

It could seem like an expensive gamble. Especially for a team that has slumped to 10th in the Premier League despite the lavish summer outlay when it is more accustomed to being in the top four Champions League places and winning trophies like the FIFA Club World Cup last year.

The new ownership - fronted by Todd Boehly and funded heavily by Clearlake Capital - has more than shown it can more than match previous investor Roman Abramovich for transfer binges until he was sanctioned over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""They have a very strong economic foundation,"" football finance expert Prof Tom Cannon told Sky News. ""They are smart about selling players as well as buying them.""

The wisdom of the spending so much, so quickly, will be determined by results more so than on the balance sheets for their fans.

Complying with financial regulations will be Chelsea's challenge.

As how such vast spending looks when the rest of the country is dealing with a cost of living crisis.

And the government is preparing to introduce plans for legislation to introduce a regulator for English football amid calls for more of the Premier League's wealth to flow down the football pyramid.

A concern will be imports are being prioritised over homegrown talent - particularly at Chelsea, which was forced to promote youngsters while the club was serving a transfer ban in the summer of 2019 for rule breaches.

Former Premier League manager Tony Pulis told Sky News: ""They seem to have double-backed on themselves.

""Instead of playing maybe the younger ones and giving them the opportunity and the chance to perform, they've gone out and spent a fortune.

""The unlucky thing for the younger players coming through, they're buying young players, they're spending fortunes on younger players from Europe.""

Before he stepped out of bed on the morning of 1 February 2003, a radio broadcast brought news that NASA's Columbia space shuttle was ""overdue"" on its return to Earth.

""I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach that something had gone wrong,"" he recalls.

The spacecraft, which had launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida just over two weeks prior, with seven astronauts aboard, was scheduled to land that morning.

But the landing never came.

Columbia, which flew its maiden voyage back in April 1981, disintegrated over Texas 16 minutes before its planned Florida touchdown, killing its entire crew. They were commander Rick Husband; pilot William McCool; the mission specialists Michael Anderson, Laurel Clark, David Brown and Kalpana Chawla; and payload specialist Ilan Ramon, who was the first Israeli astronaut.

It marked the beginning of the end for America's space shuttle programme, which had already endured the loss of seven astronauts in the Challenger disaster of 1986.

For Hubbard, a veteran of the US space agency who served as its first Mars programme director, Columbia changed his view of rocket launches forever.

""When that low-frequency rumble, that pressure wave hits you, you have a feeling of awe about the power that is being used to lift out of the gravity well of the Earth. But having had the Columbia experience, when I see a launch that has people on board, there's that extra sense of anxiety: 'Have I done everything possible to ensure mission success?'""

The call that changed everything

Before the loss of the crew was even confirmed, Hubbard received a call from the NASA administrator's office asking him to represent the agency in an investigation into what happened.

The administrator at the time was Sean O'Keefe, who was with the families of the astronauts when it became clear something was wrong.

""The mood went from excitement and anticipation to despair, once it became evident that the shuttle wasn't coming home,"" he tells Sky News.

""Normally, you can set your watch as to when the shuttle will come through the atmosphere. Just like a launch day, we had a countdown clock, with these big numbers that would progressively roll downwards.

""It got to within about two minutes of 00 - usually before you see the shuttle, you hear two sonic booms as the shuttle passes the sound barrier, which tells you it's about to land. Neither sonic boom showed up.""

The breakup of Columbia had already occurred, its wreckage raining down on Texas while the crew's loved ones waited unawares at the Kennedy Space Center.

Not long later, the official investigation was launched.

Scott Hubbard was picked as the only NASA representative on the investigative board to work with Air Force generals, Navy admirals, and former US astronauts to paint a detailed picture of why Columbia ended in tragedy.

""I knew, if we were facing loss of the crew, that this would be having the same impact on the agency that the Challenger accident had years before,"" he says.

""So I went into this with a determination to do whatever I could.""

'The most difficult duty'

The Columbia investigation was expected to last 30 days. It ended up taking six months.

Beginning with seven-day work weeks from a base outside Johnson Space Center in Houston, Hubbard labels it the ""most difficult duty"" of his 20 years at NASA.

""The first part was the very sad search and recovery operation for the remains of the crew, so the families could have some closure,"" he says. Remains for all seven astronauts were found.

Some 25,000 people were involved in efforts to collect pieces of the wreckage, O'Keefe recalls, which was strewn across a 200-mile swathe of land from Dallas to the Louisiana border.

Hubbard's background in science and engineering saw him assigned to focus on the technical cause of the accident.

""Initially, it was circumstantial evidence,"" recalls Hubbard.

""There was only one good, high-resolution image of this piece of foam falling off of the main tank and hitting the shuttle somewhere on its left wing, and then a spray of debris coming out.""

That incident had occurred not during re-entry, but after the launch on 16 January - 82 seconds into the flight.

Mission control notified the commander and pilot, who were assured that - because it had happened on previous missions too - there was no reason for alarm when it came to re-entry.

Proving the cause of the tragedy

But when Columbia re-entered the atmosphere, the damage to the wing let in ""superheated gases"" that led to the destruction of the wing and subsequent disintegration of the entire shuttle.

""Foam falling off had been happening since the very first flight of the shuttle, 30 years before,"" says Hubbard.

""But while it was originally labelled an in-flight anomaly, which is the most serious of problems, it eventually became considered a turnaround issue, just a maintenance thing, and was demoted in its seriousness.

""We think this casual approach, to what was a serious issue, was one of the organisational causes of the accident.""

Image: G. Scott Hubbard during a news briefing on the investigation into the disaster

Due to a ""sense of denial"" among those who were interviewed during the investigation, Hubbard says he pushed for a test that would look to recreate the so-called anomaly, settling on a research facility in Texas used to simulate the impact of a bird striking parts of an aeroplane.

Over the course of months, it was configured to the specifications of what happened to Columbia.

The test was carried out on live TV on 7 July 2003 - and the result was beyond doubt.

""It caused two emotions in me simultaneously,"" Hubbard recalls.

""One was 'yes, we proved it', and the other was, 'oh my God, this is how these people died'.

""And that was... quite a moment.""

The legacy of Columbia

The Columbia Accident Investigation Board's full report - which O'Keefe received 10 days before its publication in August 2003 - made 29 recommendations to improve the safety of future space shuttle flights, all of which were adopted by NASA.

They included that foam falling from the shuttle's external tank during launch, as had been accepted as par for the course among NASA engineers, should no longer be allowed to happen.

The agency has not lost astronauts during spaceflight since.

""It was a hard-hitting report,"" says O'Keefe. ""Nothing was light about it. It was very critical, however, that's what we needed to hear.""

NASA commemorates the victims of Columbia, as well as its other fallen astronauts, every January, with flowers laid and tributes read during a memorial service at Kennedy Space Center.

The site at Cape Canaveral has been a hub of excitement since November, when the launch of the Artemis mission kicked off NASA's bid to return people to the moon for the first time in more than 50 years.

Space is also increasingly the playground of private enterprise, with the likes of SpaceX and Blue Origin setting themselves grand targets to go further than humans have before. A worthy venture, O'Keefe says, but - for all the wonder so many feel upon witnessing a launch - never one that should see people lose sight of the risk.

""The nature of it just scared me every single time,"" he admits. ""Everybody who talked about shuttle launches that are 'routine' - there is no such thing. Every one of them is an opportunity for disaster, and that's the nature of it.

""But over the course of human history, we have done things that are inherently dangerous because our curiosity gets the better of us.""

For Hubbard, who became chairman of SpaceX's safety panel in 2012, with Elon Musk among those receiving his advice, the lessons learned from Columbia are only growing in importance.

""Space is a hard thing to do, launching humans into space is difficult, and we have been fortunate that thus far there have been relatively few disasters,"" he tells Sky News. (NASA has lost 15 astronauts during spaceflight: seven in Columbia and Challenger, and one, Michael Adams, in a sub-orbital flight in 1967.)

Hubbard says the experience of Columbia ""profoundly changed"" his view of human exploration of space, but our collective ambition to go further, faster, is only going one way.

""Any rocket you send up there, you can't say with any certainty it's going to be just fine,"" says O'Keefe. ""But the alternative is: 'let's not go?' And the answer is, you can't relent to that.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201033805/https://news.sky.com/story/nasa-columbia-disaster-the-investigation-into-one-of-historys-worst-space-tragedies-and-its-lasting-legacy-12796499;6

Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, told Sky News that the hardest fighting was yet to come and said the next few months would be crucial in deciding the course of the war.

He urged western allies to send more weapons, including Royal Air Force Typhoon jets from the UK and fighter aircraft from other partners.

""Russia is preparing for maximum escalation,"" Mr Danilov said in an interview on Tuesday at his headquarters in the capital Kyiv.

""It is gathering everything possible, doing drills and training.""

He did not rule out the possibility that President Vladimir Putin attempts another attack from the north, south and east, as happened on 24 February 2022 - maybe even to coincide with the anniversary.

""We do understand everything is on the table… I can say that we are not excluding any scenario in the next two to three weeks.""

He said that Ukraine's military was preparing for all possibilities and this time around had significantly more support from western partners such as the UK than 12 months ago.

""Those countries who help us in our struggle have started to provide us maximum help.""

""We will continue to monitor that,"" the western official said in a briefing to journalists.

""Traditionally they [Russia] have tried to do things on dates. The Ukrainians come from a similar culture as well in that regard, but I haven't seen anything from either side to suggest they do have plans afoot.""

Mr Danilov said he expected about half of more than 320,000 soldiers mobilised by Russia last September would be involved in the second wave whenever it came.

The first half of the manpower have already been deployed to Ukraine to replenish Russian lines after Moscow's invading forces suffered significant losses.

Ukraine has also paid a heavy price in military personnel and civilians killed and wounded.

Yet the top security official predicted even bloodier days ahead.

""Of course. We went through an extensive difficult period, but I'm conscious the main fights are yet to come and they will happen this year, within two to three months. These will be defining months in the war,"" Mr Danilov said.

It is why the Ukrainians are desperate for their western partners to send more lethal weapons and faster.

They have secured tanks - belatedly - and are now after fast jets.

""It would be great if they were [RAF] Typhoon jets. F-16s are also good,"" Mr Danilov said.

""Any help would be good.""

It is not just Russian forces rearming and preparing to go on the attack.

""We have our own plans and they are clear to us,"" Mr Danilov said - but they are secret.

""They're not hidden from our main partners: the UK, US and other countries who are helping us. We will follow our plan.""

The ultimate goal is to retake all territory captured by Russian forces - not just since 24 February 2022 but since Russia launched its first invasion of Ukraine back in 2014, capturing the Crimean peninsula and backing so-called separatists in the eastern Donbas region.

It's alleged the Tate brothers recruited their victims by seducing them and falsely claiming to want a relationship or marriage.

Prosecutors say the women were then forced to produce pornographic content under duress.

Kickboxer turned influencer, Andrew Tate, is also accused of raping one of the victims last March. All four deny the allegations.

Earlier this month, a court extended their preventative custody period to 27 February.

Today, defence teams will try to argue that there is not enough evidence to continue to hold them.

Following the arrests, Romanian authorities said they seized goods and money worth almost £3.25m ($4m) including luxury cars.

Dallas Police said they found the emperor tamarin monkeys after getting a tip that they could be in the Lancaster home, located just south of the zoo.

The zoo alerted police on Monday morning that the white-whiskered pair were missing and that it was ""clear"" the habitat had been ""intentionally compromised"".

No arrests have been made - deepening the mystery at the zoo that has included other cut fences, the escape of a small leopard and the suspicious death of an endangered vulture.

Police said the monkeys were believed to have been taken after someone cut an opening in their enclosure. The monkeys were found in a closet and returned to the zoo for veterinary evaluation.

Detectives are still working to determine whether or not the incidents over the last few weeks are related.

On Tuesday, police released a photo and video of a man they said they wanted to talk to about the monkeys. The photo shows a man eating Doritos while walking, and in the video clip he is seen walking down a path.

The incident was the second time this month that an animal had gone missing at the zoo.

On 13 January, the zoo was closed after workers arrived in the morning and found that a clouded leopard named Nova had gone.

After a search that included police the leopard was found a day later near her habitat. Police said a cutting tool was intentionally used to make the opening in her enclosure.

Just over a week later on 21 January, an endangered lappet-faced vulture named Pin was found dead by workers.

Gregg Hudson, the zoo's president and chief executive, called the death ""very suspicious"" and said the 35-year-old vulture had ""a wound"". but declined to give further details.

Mr Hudson said in a news conference following Pin's death that the vulture enclosure didn't appear to be tampered with. Pin was one of four lappet-faced vultures at the zoo.

It happened at the Rafter K Rodeo Winter Series at the American Legion Post 290 venue in the city of King on Saturday, officials said.

The rider was named as Denim Bradshaw by event organisers in a Facebook post.

Paramedics were called to the scene following a report of a cardiac arrest. The teenager was taken to hospital where he later died.

His mother, Shannon Bowman, shared her heartbreak in a Facebook post.

""Last night was the longest night of my life!"" she wrote.

""My beautiful handsome 14 year old son had went to be with the lord! I awoke in a nightmare for the rest of my life!""

She added she had ""never seen him so happy as I had seen him last night before his departure"" - and praised him for his bravery and courage.

Amanda Paquette, whose son also took part in the event, told local TV station WFMY News 2 she saw the bull stomp on Denim's chest after he fell.

Event organisers wrote on Facebook: ""Everyone here at Rafter K Rodeo Company, LLC would like to give our sincere condolences to the family and friends of bull rider, Denim Bradshaw.

""Our sport is truly a family and we are so thankful for everyone that was there to help.""

They added: ""This is a tragic event and words cannot describe the pain felt by this loss.""

Denim's sister wrote on a GoFundMe page she set up to help with funeral expenses that it was his first time riding a bull.

She wrote: ""Denim adventured into the world of bull riding and fell in love. The boots, the cowboy hats, and those big belt buckles - he loved it all.

Former prime minister Boris Johnson has called for Western leaders to send fighter jets to Ukraine.

Mr Johnson is currently in the United States drumming up support for Ukraine in the face of the Russian invasion.

He was speaking after the UK and US ruled out sending planes such as the Typhoon, the F-35 or the F-16, to the conflict.

US President Joe Biden has explicitly ruled out shipping F-16s to Volodymyr Zelenskyy's forces.

Speaking to Fox News, Mr Johnson said: ""Every time we have said it will be a mistake to give such and such an item of weaponry, we end up doing it and it ends up being the right thing for Ukraine.""

He said this has been the case with anti-tank missiles, Himars and MLRS rocket launchers, and tanks.

""All I'm saying is save time, save money, save lives. Give the Ukrainians what they need as fast as possible,"" Mr Johnson said.

Asked about the possibility of Vladimir Putin turning the conflict nuclear, Mr Johnson said the Russian president is ""not going to do that"" as the West would put his economy into ""cryogenic paralysis"" that would take decades to recover from.

Adapting to higher temperatures and the more intense heatwaves and storms they are predicted to bring, requires investment of around £10bn a year, says the Climate Change Committee (CCC).

Spending on everything from flood defences, to more heat-resilient homes, to improved drinking water supplies is falling well short of what is needed to insulate the UK from climate impacts, according to the report.

""It is no secret that the UK is now experiencing a range of damaging consequences of climate change, but adaptation in the UK remains chronically underfunded and overlooked. This must change,"" said Baroness Brown, chair of the CCC's Adaptation Committee.

When it comes to reducing the risk of climate change itself through its net zero strategy, the government has been clear in defining priorities, says the report.

The same approach has to be used in adapting to the warming that is inevitable due to global warming that's already under way, it warns.

Key recommendations include improving drainage in urban areas to cope with flooding from extreme rainfall; making more use of ""nature based solutions"" to reduce the risk of flooding from the sea and rivers; and increasing the ability of the public water system to cope with drought, including investment in new reservoirs and ""interconnectors"" between water companies.

The committee also singled out the need to ""climate-proof"" infrastructure like roads and railways and the need to retrofit homes to cope with excess heat.

The Office for National Statistics recently estimated 2,800 excess deaths were linked to heatwaves last summer.

Some actions require direct investment, particularly things like flood defences or tree planting to reduce flood risk, the report finds.

However, many others can be funded by changing planned investments to factor in things like increased temperatures or flood risk, when it comes to improving water supplies, or building new roads, bridges or railways.

""Integrating climate risk into economic and financial decision-making across society is essential for urgently needed investments in our national climate resilience to materialise,"" said Ben Caldecott, a co-author of the report.

By increasing interest rates to 4%, the Bank of England may help savers, according to financial experts.



Following a period of ultra-low savings rates below 1%, a new account - potentially at a new bank - may offer a better return, according to Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest.

But with hints from the Bank that rates may have peaked, savers should consider acting before inflation drops, she said.

""With a wide range of interest rates available at banks and via smart money apps like Plum, there are some good options out there for growing your savings.""

Jason Ferrando, the CEO of money-lending platform easyMoney, called on more banks to increase return yields for their customers.

""Despite this latest rate rise hurting variable rate borrowers, there is a flip-side for investors and savers that is the yield on their savings may see a better return thanks to today's Bank of England decision.""

Meanwhile, the leader of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) accused Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt of being ""missing in action"" as hundreds of thousands of workers strike in the biggest day of industrial action for more than a decade.

General secretary of the TUC Paul Nowak told Sky News the government is ""playing a little bit fast and loose with the British public"" in suggesting that issues around workload, recruitment and retention can be addressed without talking about pay at the same time.

Teachers in England and Wales who are members of the National Education Union (NEU) are staging walkouts today - which the union estimates will affect 23,000 schools.

Data from the NEU suggest 85% of schools across both nations will be fully or partially closed, leaving some parents with no choice but to take leave from work or arrange childcare.

Education Secretary Gillian Keegan admitted to Sky News that the government ""don't know"" the exact number of schools that have closed their gates but will be publishing that information ""this afternoon"".

""We have done a survey which a lot of heads responded to, so that gives us some idea,"" she said, adding that ""the majority of schools would be open"".

Ms Keegan added that it would be ""irresponsible"" to offer pay rises in line with inflation.

Train drivers from the RMT and Aslef unions are also staging another strike as a long-running dispute over pay and conditions rumbles on - with university lecturers and bus drivers taking action too.

About 123 government departments are set to be disrupted by industrial action as well.

Protests are being held across the country against the government's controversial plans for a new law on minimum service levels during strikes.

Downing Street conceded that today's mass strike action will be ""very difficult"" for the public.

A Number 10 spokesperson said: ""We regret the decision taken by multiple unions to strike as we greatly value the work of their members.

""We want open and honest dialogue about pay.

""Secretaries of state continue to have constructive meetings with their union counterparts, representing a positive step towards increasing dialogue and finding common ground.

""We also want to discuss non-pay concerns including conditions and workload.

""We cannot chase the tail of inflation. Increasing all public sector pay would cost £28bn - equivalent to £1,000 for every household.""

By increasing interest rates to 4%, the Bank of England may help savers, according to financial experts.



Following a period of ultra-low savings rates below 1%, a new account - potentially at a new bank - may offer a better return, according to Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest.

But with hints from the Bank that rates may have peaked, savers should consider acting before inflation drops, she said.

There are ""good options"" out there for savers, said Victor Trokoudes, CEO of the investment and budgeting app Plum.

""Hopefully this new base rate will benefit savers. It's good to see that some banks have now adjusted their interest rates,"" he said.

""With a wide range of interest rates available at banks and via smart money apps like Plum, there are some good options out there for growing your savings.""

Jason Ferrando, the CEO of money-lending platform easyMoney, called on more banks to increase return yields for their customers.

""Despite this latest rate rise hurting variable rate borrowers, there is a flip-side for investors and savers that is the yield on their savings may see a better return thanks to today's Bank of England decision.""

Positive signs are emerging that the West is willing to provide more, and better, weapons to Ukraine. But with the first anniversary of the conflict fast approaching, there are fears that Ukraine and Russia could remain locked in stalemate over the next year.

Professor Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, has warned in an essay for Foreign Politics that ""incrementally expanding military and economic assistance"" - as the West is doing currently - ""is likely to only prolong the war indefinitely"".

He wrote that Ukraine's allies should start rapidly expanding their weapons deliveries and sanctions on Russia to support a ""breakthrough"" in the conflict.

""Even though Putin must understand by now that Ukrainians are willing to fight for as long as it takes to liberate their country, he still believes that time is on his side. That is because Putin expects Western governments and societies to lose their will and interest to keep helping Ukraine,"" he said.



Professor McFaul said the support should be provided ""swiftly"" - and could even be part of a ""Big Bang"" to mark the anniversary.

""Rather than providing ATACMs in March, Reapers in June, and jets in September, NATO should go for a Big Bang,"" he said.

""Plans to provide all these systems should be announced on February 24, 2023, the first anniversary of Putin's invasion.

""An announcement of this size will produce an important psychological effect inside the Kremlin and Russian society, signaling that the West is committed to Ukraine's ambition to liberate all occupied territories.""

He acknowledged there were risks to providing more support, but said there were also risks to taking no action.

For example, he said fears that Vladimir Putin could escalate the war have so far not come to fruition.

""The reason is simple: Putin has no good way of doing so,"" Mr McFaul said.

""He is already using very expensive cruise missiles to attack apartment buildings. He cannot attack NATO, lest he risk a broader war that Russia would lose quickly. That leaves him with only the nuclear option, but even that would not serve him well.""



He added that if the war drags on for years, many more people will die - and this would be ""the cost of incrementalism"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201091201/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russia-aiming-to-degrade-civilian-morale-in-kherson-and-could-we-see-f-16-aircraft-in-skies-over-ukraine-12541713;5

In 2020, he revealed he has Parkinson's disease.

Osbourne has made a few announcements of gigs being cancelled and rescheduled over the past few years, but has now said he cannot handle the travelling associated with a major tour.

Writing on Instagram, he said: ""This is probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to share with my loyal fans.

""I am honestly humbled by the way you've all patiently held on to your tickets for all this time, but in all good conscience I have now come to the realisation that I'm not physically capable of doing my upcoming European/UK tour dates, as I know I couldn't deal with the travel required,"" he said.

Ukraine has managed to repair several power units that were damaged in Russian missile attacks – helping to ease the country's electricity shortage.

Officials have said about 40% of the system has been damaged as a result.

But while the power shortage has not been completely fixed, the repairs have improved the situation, meaning blackouts could become less frequent.

The power shortage reached 25% at the end of January.

The ministry said warm weather could also help reduce demand on the strained power system.

A major search involving police dive teams, drones, firefighters and mountain rescue volunteers continues.

Friends and family have also been part of a widespread community search.

Officers have said they are ""extremely concerned"" for Ms Bulley's welfare, but stressed the investigation still remains a missing person inquiry and there is nothing, at the moment, to suggest third-party involvement in her disappearance.

By Sky News' international affairs editor, Dominic Waghorn.

The US ambassador to NATO has told Sky News a renewed Russian offensive can be expected soon in Ukraine, following predictions from a senior Ukrainian security official that one could come within weeks.



""In terms of a big emboldened move on the part of the Ukrainians or the Russians, I think we can anticipate that when the ground isn’t frozen and when the weather conditions get a bit better,"" said Julianne Smith told Sky News.

The race is on to arm Ukraine with the means to defend itself.

""What the alliance is doing is, individual members of the alliance [are] ensuring we get as much [of] the equipment in the hands of the Ukrainian military as possible so they can be ready for any coming offensive.""

After weeks of hesitation, Germany and America have now agreed to send battle tanks along with European allies.

In the face of claims that delay may cost lives, the ambassador did not rule out them being in use within a few weeks.

""It depends on how fast we can train them up. The one thing that has been unbelievable over the last year has been the Ukrainian military's ability to train up on military equipment and utilise it in real-time.""

And in response to Ukrainian claims Russia may attempt another offensive from the north on the capital Kyiv, ambassador Smith told Sky News it is not likely.

""I don’t think anybody sees that coming at least for now. Right now I suspect they want to hang onto that territory in the east and the south.""

Although intense in places, the pace of fighting in Ukraine has slowed over winter. The ambassador says NATO expects that to go up a gear as spring approaches.

NATO has been accused of arming Ukraine on a piecemeal basis, giving them just enough to continue the war, but not win it.

The alliance will need to prove it can supply enough arms quickly enough to repel any offensive launched by Russia.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201123454/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russia-warns-us-over-missiles-it-is-reportedly-sending-to-ukraine-12541713;5

Pakistan's economic woes are a culmination of years of political turmoil, a financial crisis and last year's catastrophic floods, with its reserves only able to cover three weeks - rather than the required three months.

Inflation is also thought to stand at around 24% to 26%, according to the country's finance ministry, and the currency has been devalued against the dollar.

Pakistan left without power after energy-saving move backfires

The IMF delegation will be encouraging the Pakistani government to implement bold cost-cutting measures to help it bridge its financial gap, with mission chief Nathan Porter saying: ""You don't have any other option.""

In 2019, Pakistan secured a $6bn (£4.9bn) bailout from the IMF. It got another $1bn (£811m) last year to help overcome the devastating floods, but in November the IMF suspended payments, saying the government failed to make progress on its fiscal consolidation.

In response, Ishaq Dar, the country's finance minister, told the IMF it had made some efforts to bring its crisis under control, including increasing taxes on petrol and natural gas, and increased prices for electricity.

If released, the cash from the IMF would go towards paying its external debt to the tune of $8bn, which has to be paid by the end of June.

The government has stopped issuing lines of credit, causing a backlog of container ships at the port of Karachi, while industry has been battered by the currency devaluation and imports block.

Domestic investment has dried up, with textile factories partially closing due to demand, and construction projects have been delayed due to lack of investment.

There has also been severe energy shortages, which has hindered remaining economic activity, while companies that generate and supply energy struggle with the high costs of fuel and turn off the electricity grid to save money.

Last week the country of 243 million people was plunged into darkness after a major breakdown of the national grid, which lasted several hours - the impact was felt on schools, hospitals, businesses and industry further hindering economic activity.

The country's economy has been faltering for many years, with the floods in 2022 pushing it over the edge.

Pakistan's floods impacted a third of the country and wiped out millions of hectares of crops. Almost 2,000 people were killed, and around 33 million people were displaced, with damage thought to cost around $40bn (£32.4bn).

Successive governments have been accused of making little effort to widening the tax net and increasing sources of revenue, while loans from allies such as China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates kept its economy afloat.

Some blame former PM Imran Khan

Former prime minister Imran Khan, and his government, have been accused of contributing to the immediate crisis. A year into his premiership, the fiscal deficit shot to a record high of $25.3bn (£20.5bn) and by the time he was ousted early last year, inflation was over 12%.

Mr Khan delayed approaching the IMF, despite economists recommending it, saying he wants to shun the practice of approaching foreign entities with a ""begging bowl"".

However, his government was unable to bear the costs of a slew of welfare schemes it rolled out - though it helped his popularity.

His government's reluctance to increase fuel costs, even in early 2022 when international crude rates had breached the $100 mark due to the war in Ukraine war, meant the state exchequer lost precious dollars.

Is Pakistan going the same way as Sri Lanka?

There is comparison of what is taking place in Pakistan with the collapse of the Sri Lankan economy last year.

But this is unlikely, as almost half of Sri Lanka's external debt was owed to private creditors while for Pakistan, this is only about 8% of what it owes.

Pakistan's large bilateral loan payments are to friendly countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and China, which will be rolled over.

With the present government starting to implement changes that would satisfy the IMF and a release of the $1.1bn tranche, this will pave the way for the release of the loan and other bilateral assistances.

The cost has come down by roughly £20,000 and last month the average house was £258,297 - a further decrease from £262,068 in December.

The figures come as the Bank of England data showed mortgage approvals continued to drop. The Bank figures showed demand for mortgages fell to the lowest level since the early days of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in December.

But house prices are still growing in the year overall, just at a slower pace. Annual house price growth slowed to 1.1%, down from 2.8% in December.

Pantheon Macroeconomics estimate the drop from the peak will reach 8%.

Would-be home owners face an uphill battle, the Nationwide data showed. The cost of living crisis, driven by double digit inflation has made saving for a deposit a difficult task.

While many film studios spend millions on their awards season campaigns, indie film To Leslie relied on a small budget and word of mouth to get noticed.

Riseborough's nomination came after some very public backing from stars including Kate Winslet, Jennifer Aniston, Edward Norton and Cate Blanchett - who is now up for the Oscar alongside the British actress.

Following the review, the Academy released a statement on behalf of chief executive Bill Kramer, saying ""social media and outreach campaigning tactics"" used by the film had ""caused concern"".

""Based on concerns that surfaced last week around the To Leslie awards campaign, the Academy began a review into the film's campaigning tactics,"" the statement read.

""The Academy has determined the activity in question does not rise to the level that the film's nomination should be rescinded.

""However, we did discover social media and outreach campaigning tactics that caused concern. These tactics are being addressed with the responsible parties directly.""

Riseborough's performance in To Leslie has been praised by critics, but before the Oscars she had not been nominated for any major awards.

In the film, she plays a single mother who turns to alcoholism after winning the lottery, before turning her life around when a motel owner offers her a job.

David Johnston, a Tory MP for Wantage, raises the experience of a couple whose baby daughter died just 23 minutes after she was born.

Gary and Sarah Andrews asked questions about this, he says, and were told that ""there things happen"" and that ""if they had to listen to the concerns of every mother they would be overwhelmed"".



It was then found that the NHS Trust had systemic failures and last week was ""given the highest fine that has ever been given for failures in maternity care"".

He asks Mr Sunak whether he agrees that ""this situation must serve as a watershed moment"".

The PM passed on his sympathies to the family.

He said he wants to make sure the NHS is the ""best and safest"" place in the country to give birth.

Primary school teacher Clodagh Glaisyer-Sidibe is on strike in Lewisham with a placard designed ""to turn heads"".

It reads: ""I could make more £s on this pole.""

""As a slightly older woman, I didn't feel I'd be making a lot of money as a pole dancer,"" she told Sky News.

""So it's showing just how little we're getting.""

But behind the humour is a serious message. Like many of her colleagues, Ms Clodagh says she is actively considering taking a second job.

""I'm single parent with two kids of my own and two foster children. And it's very hard. We don't go out for meals and we live very carefully,"" she said.

Along with dozens of her colleagues, Ms Clodagh is making her way to the rally in central London, where thousands of striking workers will congregate.

""We're overworked and undervalued. We're stretched too thin and can't meet the children's needs.

Mohamed El Abboud, 28, and Kusai Al-Jundi, 25, targeted trusting mother-of-two Louise Kam, who had previously owned a catering business with her ex-husband before going into rental properties.

Al-Jundi, a chef from, north-west London, spent months attempting to trick Ms Kam, from Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, into giving him control of two properties she owned in Willesden and East Barnet by offering her millions of pounds.

He also aimed to gain control of her finances by convincing her to sign a Lasting Power of Attorney document.

But the scam came to a head when Ms Kam made it clear she would not sign over the properties.

The pair then lured her to her three-bedroom property in Barnet on 26 July last year. There she was strangled with a hairdryer cord during a ""violent struggle"".

Her body was then wrapped up in a duvet, dumped in a wheelie bin and covered with garden rubbish.

The following day the pair moved the bin to a road in Harrow where they lined it up with other bins showing the same number on the front in what the court heard was a plot to ""cover up"" the pair's ""atrocity"".

Image: A photo issued by Metropolitan Police of the wheelie bin where the body of Louise Kam was found

El Abboud and Al-Jundi were convicted at the Old Bailey on 19 January after officers untangled their lies and found evidence linking them to her murder.

On Wednesday the pair were both sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 35 years years, by Judge Mark Lucraft KC, who said the murder of Ms Kam was motivated ""by greed"".

Phone used to pretend victim was still alive

Ms Kam, from Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, was last seen by a family member near the Spires Shopping Centre in Barnet on 26 July 2021.

She was reported missing to police the following day and an investigation was launched to find her.

Her black BMW was recovered by police on 28 July in Edgware. Her body was discovered on 1 August 2021 in a wheelie bin on Wood End Road, Harrow.

Investigators said the following day Al-Jundi sent Ms Kam's family and friends messages pretending she was alive and that she had gone on holiday.

On the same day El-Abboud sold Ms Kam's BMW and bought new clothes with the proceeds.

He also posted a TikTok video of him dancing and gyrating to music in the driveway of her Barnet home.

The judge had told how Al-Jundi had been described as a Walter Mitty character who falsely claimed to be a ""person of means"" with the backing of a multi-millionaire girlfriend when he set about tricking Ms Kam out of her property.

Having resolved to murder her to get hold of her assets, he promised El-Abboud a share ""as a reward for killing her"", the judge said.

Motivated by 'greed'

In sentencing both to life in prison, with a minimum term of 35 years, Judge Mark Lucraft KC said: ""El-Abboud, it might be said that Al-Jundi played the lead role in the long-running defrauding of Louise, but I draw no distinction on the sentence to be passed on the two of you.

""The evidence clearly shows what you did and did willingly and that you, along with Al-Jundi, did what you did out of greed.""

Catherine Gould, prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""This horrific crime is a tale of greed taken to extremes. Al-Jundi and El-Abboud selfishly and brutally ended Louise Kam's life for their own ends.

""These defendants hatched a plan to kill Louise and profit from her death.""

In a victim impact statement, Ms Kam's son Gregory Kam said the family had been left in a state of ""disbelief"" at what happened to his mother.

He said: ""I deeply regret I was not able to do enough at the time to prevent my mother from falling for the lies of his wolf in sheep's clothing.

""In addition to the initial shocking news of our mother's disappearance and subsequent news of her murder, I was not only shocked but further angered and sickened to discover defendant one (Al-Jundi) enlisted the help of an accomplice (El-Abboud) to trick, entrap, overpower and murder a pension-age woman in her own home under the guise of what was supposed to be a business deal.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201124930/http://news.sky.com/story/louise-kam-two-men-jailed-for-murder-and-fraud-plot-12800016;5

Football officials Australia and New Zealand said they were disappointed not to be consulted about the deal with Visit Saudi by FIFA before reports emerged.

They have written to the world governing body seeking urgent clarification.

Human rights group Amnesty International urged FIFA to speak out on the need for more human rights reforms in Saudi Arabia rather than allowing its showpiece women's tournament to be used for ""sportswashing"" the country's image and for the exploitation of players.

Sportswashing relates to enhancing the reputation of a controversial country or an organisation by using sport sponsorship.

The tournament, which has been expanded from 24 to 32 teams for this edition, opens in July with European champions England trying to win their first Women's World Cup.

Football Australia said it ""understands FIFA has entered into a destination partnership agreement"" for the tournament.

The organisation added in a statement: ""We are very disappointed that Football Australia were not consulted on this matter prior to any decision being made.

""Football Australia and New Zealand Football have jointly written to FIFA to urgently clarify the situation.""

Separately, New Zealand Football said ""we are shocked and disappointed"" to hear the reports about the sponsorship.

Amnesty International said it is concerned about what it calls a ""rolling crackdown on human rights"" under crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Felix Jakens, Amnesty International UK's Head of Priority Campaigns and Individuals at Risk, said: ""FIFA should speak out about the need for human rights reform in Saudi Arabia and not merely allow its premier women's tournament to be used for sportswashing.

""Players, coaches and fans should likewise challenge this crude exploitation of their sport by Saudi Arabia.""

FIFA had no immediate comment. There was no response from the Saudi government.

Jakens added: ""Women in Saudi Arabia face serious discrimination in marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody rights, while Saudi women who've dared to speak out about the need for reforms in the country have received massive jail sentences.""

Saudi Arabia is increasingly using the allure of sport as a soft power push to clean up its image after criticism of human rights violations and ongoing concern about the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi after he entered the consulate in Istanbul.

One of the world's biggest footballers - Cristiano Ronaldo - has just made his debut for Saudi club Al-Nassr after a lucrative financial package was offered.

The Saudi sovereign wealth fund bought Newcastle in 2021 and the club has just reached its first cup final this century after success in the League Cup semi-finals this week.

The Public Investment Fund has also shaken up golf by launching the breakaway LIV Series that has attracted some of the game's leading stars.

Saudi Arabia is also considering a 2030 men's World Cup bid alongside Egypt and Greece.

Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse, who goes by Nathan Chasing Horse, allegedly committed the offences across a period spanning two decades, according to police records.

He is also believed to be the leader of a cult known as The Circle, according to a 50-page search warrant, obtained by the AP news agency.

The 46-year-old actor, best known for his role as the young Sioux tribe member Smiles A Lot in the 1999 Kevin Costner film, was arrested near the North Las Vegas home he is said to share with his five wives.

A police SWAT unit was seen outside the property on Tuesday evening as detectives searched inside.

Following his appearance in Dances With Wolves, Chasing Horse gained a reputation among tribes across the United States and in Canada as a so-called medicine man who performed healing ceremonies and spiritual gatherings.

Police allege that he used his position to abuse young Native American girls.

According to the warrant, Las Vegas police have identified at least six alleged victims and uncovered sexual allegations against Chasing Horse.

The allegations date back to the early 2000s in multiple states, including Montana, South Dakota and Nevada, where he has lived for about a decade.

Although the warrant includes details of crimes reported elsewhere, the arrest stems from crimes allegedly committed in Nevada's Clark County.

They include sex trafficking, sexual assault of a child younger than 16 and child abuse, while some of the alleged victims were as young as 13, according to the warrant.

One of Chasing Horse's wives was allegedly offered to him as a ""gift"" when she was 15, while another became a wife after turning 16.

Chasing Horse is also accused of recording sexual assaults and arranging sex with the victims for other men who allegedly paid him.

According to the warrant, Chasing Horse was banished in 2015 from the Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, Montana, after allegations of human trafficking.

There was no lawyer listed in court records for Chasing Horse who could comment on his behalf as of Tuesday evening.

Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201124930/http://news.sky.com/story/dances-with-wolves-star-nathan-chasing-horse-arrested-on-suspicion-of-sexually-assaulting-young-girls-12800505;5

Ian Byrne, the Labour MP for West Derby in Liverpool, is now asking an urgent question on the national police response to a Hillsborough families report that was published yesterday.



Police pledged reforms in reply to the former bishop of Liverpool, whose report five years ago made recommendations to ensure the suffering of the Hillsborough families is never repeated.



The government has been criticised for not offering its own formal response to the findings and Mr Byrne asks when the Home office will do this.

Policing minister Chris Philp said the government is committed to engaging with Hillsborough families before publishing their response, but that he has asked for this to be sped up and is ""expecting it to come out in the course of this Spring"".

Mr Byrne says it is ""shameful"" the government has not issued a formal response yet and the police response yesterday was ""far too little and far too late"".

Among the changes police pledged is a Charter For Families Bereaved Through Public Tragedy, which commits police leaders to acknowledge any mistakes and ensure ""care, compassion, openness, transparency and accountability"".



However, families of the 97 who died in the 1989 stadium crush want a law that creates a statuary duty for police officers to tell the truth and comply with investigations.

Mr Byrne asked policing minister Chris Philip if the government will ""do the right thing"" and implement the Hillsborough Law"" - as Labour have done - with ""immediate effect"".

Mr Philip did not directly respond to the question.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201124930/http://news.sky.com/story/politics-news-latest-sunak-attacked-for-how-he-handled-two-tory-controversies-12593360;1

Police were called to a house in the Broadlands area at about 5pm on Tuesday, but Alice died at the scene shortly after.

The dog was put down and no one else was hurt. There have been no arrests.

Police Superintendent Matt Bullivant called it an ""absolutely tragic incident"" and said people should not speculate about the circumstances.

Neighbour Rita Matthews, 36, said she would often see Alice while walking her own daughter to school.

""She was always holding her mummy's hand on the way back,"" she said.

""It's so sad we're not going to see the girl again and I pray all the best to her mum to get her strength back.""

She said Alice was a ""happy little girl, very happy"".

""She would say 'Bye, auntie', and I would say 'Bye, little girl',"" said Ms Matthews.

Police confirmed the dog had been humanely put down ""to ensure public safety"".

The end-of-terrace house was still cordoned off on Wednesday, with a forensic tent by the garden and officers on the street.

A statement from Bob Bauer, personal attorney for the President, read: ""Today, with the President's full support and cooperation, the DOJ is conducting a planned search of his home in Rehoboth, Delaware.

""Under DOJ's standard procedures, in the interests of operational security and integrity, it sought to do this work without advance public notice, and we agreed to cooperate.

""The search today is a further step in a thorough and timely DOJ process we will continue to fully support and facilitate. We will have further information at the conclusion of today's search.""

The FBI has yet to comment on the search.

It comes after Mr Biden's lawyer last month confirmed that six further documents containing classification markings were found at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware.

Previously, Mr Biden's legal team acknowledged it had found classified documents relating to his time as vice-president in the Obama administration at his home, including some in his garage.

Aides previously found another batch of classified documents at a Washington think-tank he was associated with.

The apparent mishandling of classified documents and official records from the Obama administration is under investigation by a former US attorney, Robert Hur, who was appointed as a special counsel in January by Attorney General Merrick Garland.

Republicans have sought to compare the investigation of Mr Biden's handling of classified documents to the ongoing probe into how former president Donald Trump handled classified documents after his presidency.

The White House, however, says the two cases are different because Biden's team has cooperated with authorities in their probe and turned over documents.

Mr Trump had resisted doing so until an FBI search at his Florida home.

A special counsel will also review Trump's handling of classified documents.

The DOJ historically imposes a high legal bar before bringing criminal charges in cases involving the mishandling of classified information, with a requirement that someone intended to break the law as opposed to being merely careless or negligent in doing so.

The National Archives has reportedly asked all former U.S. presidents and vice presidents to search their personal records for classified documents or other presidential material that should have been turned over when they left office.

In December 2022, Benjamin Netanyahu returned to office as prime minister of Israel for the sixth time - but his coalition government has caused controversy, with religious hardliners and ultranationalists taking posts.

Tensions have been rising between Israel and the Palestinians in recent weeks, with escalating violence in the region.

US secretary of state Antony Blinken arrived in the country earlier this week and appealed to ""everyone to take steps to calm tensions rather than inflame them"".

Labour grandee Dame Margaret Hodge called Ms Johnson's language ""unacceptable and dangerous"", adding: ""With violence escalating in recent weeks, this careless remark only makes it harder to bridge the divide.""

Astiaj Haghighi and her fiancé Amir Mohammad Ahmadi were also banned from social activities on the internet and from leaving the country for two years.

The Instagram users, both aged in their 20s, were arrested on 1 November after the video of them dancing at the Azadi Tower went viral.

The news agency of Human Rights Activists (HRANA) said they were both jailed for 10 years and six months for ""promotion of impurity and indecency, assembly and collusion against national security, and propaganda against the regime"".

In defiance of the country's strict rules, Ms Haghighi was not wearing a headscarf in the video while women are forbidden from dancing in public.

HRANA said a source had revealed the couple had been denied a lawyer during the proceedings at a revolutionary court in Tehran.

Ms Haghighi is also said to have been relocated to Qarchak Prison, in Varamin, where the conditions come under regular criticism by campaigners.

Iran has taken an even harder line than normal with any forms of dissent since widespread protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in September.

148;148;3067;3067;Biggest year ever for crypto hacking - with North Korea the suspected culprit;Wednesday 1 February 2023 12:53, UK;[];['cryptocurrencies'];['chainalysis', 'biggest', 'hackers', 'hacking', 'stolen', 'worldwide', 'assets', 'culprit', 'suspected', 'korea', 'uk', 'cryptocurrency', 'north', 'crypto', '2022'];"2022 was the biggest year ever for cryptocurrency hacking, with more than £3.2bn stolen worldwide, according to new research.

October alone saw £629m taken - the most recorded in a single month.

It helped the overall year dwarf 2021's previous high of £2.7bn, although the total number of hacks fell slightly.

The annual report by Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm which sees its data used by governments, banks, and businesses worldwide, says the activity was largely driven by hackers based in North Korea.

Kim Jong Un's regime has repeatedly been accused of hacking cryptocurrencies to make money and evade international sanctions, even using stolen digital assets to fund its missile programme.

In 2022, Chainalysis says hackers associated with Pyongyang - notably criminal syndicate Lazarus Group - stole an estimated £1.4bn in cryptocurrency assets, breaking their own record.

Researchers have previously linked the group to the regime, though it is not known whether it is part of the government's own operations or an external hire.

The amount of crypto thought to have been stolen hugely outweighs North Korea's total annual exports, which latest figures from the Observatory of Economic Complexity put at £115m for 2020.

""It isn't a stretch to say that cryptocurrency hacking is a sizable chunk of the nation's economy,"" said Chainalysis.

Where was the money stolen from?

The biggest victims of crypto hacks in 2022 were within decentralised finance protocols, which is essentially when investors cut out the middle man - like a bank or exchange - and transfer funds directly between digital wallets.

It's becoming increasingly popular as it's considered more transparent, which people are placing more value in following the collapse of major crypto platform FTX.

But according to Chainalysis, these so-called DeFi protocols made up 82.1% of crypto stolen by hackers in 2022, totalling more than £2.5bn.

David Schwed, of blockchain security company Halborn, said DeFi developers should not be afraid of looking to traditional centralised systems for inspiration in making themselves safer to use.

""You don't need to move as slow as a bank, but you can borrow from what banks do,"" he said.

UK's 'encouraging' regulation plans

The report comes as the UK government unveils proposals to regulate crypto, as the market seeks to regain the confidence of investors spooked by an exceptionally volatile period.

Under the plans, which would bring the industry more in line with traditional financial systems, crypto platforms would become responsible for defining the demands that a currency must meet before being admitted for trading.

Exchanges will also be held accountable for safely facilitating transactions and keeping customer assets safe.

Jordan Wain, UK public policy lead at Chainalysis, told Sky News the regulation was welcome.

""It is encouraging to see the prominent thread of consumer protection running through these plans, which evidence a clear intent to tackle potentially abusive behaviours,"" he said.

But he warned that tougher rules must not harm the industry's ""potential for innovation and growth"".

The proposals, which come less than a year after Rishi Sunak said he wanted the UK to become a ""global crypto asset hub"", will go out for consultation before coming into force.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201153119/http://news.sky.com/story/biggest-year-ever-for-crypto-hacking-with-north-korea-the-suspected-culprit-12800600;6

Decades before the infamous Salem witch trials in Massachusetts, Alse Young on 26 May 1647 became the first person on record to be executed in the American colonies for witchcraft.

She was the first of nine women and two men executed in Connecticut for witchcraft over a 15-year period, during which more than 40 people faced trial for having ties to Satan.

The Windsor town clerk registered her death in a diary entry that read: ""Alse Young was hanged.""

Now, activists including amateur historians, researchers and descendants of the accused witches and their accusers hope state legislators will finally offer posthumous exonerations.

Connecticut state senator Saud Anwar and state representative Jane Garibay have proposed resolutions to officially exonerate the state's witch trial victims.

Ms Garibay, who received letters from eighth and ninth-generation relatives of accused witches, said: ""They're talking about how this has followed their families from generation to generation, and that they would love for someone just to say, 'Hey, this was wrong'. And to me, that's an easy thing to do if it gives people peace.""

Mr Anwar said he expects some people might laugh or scoff at the campaign, but added families are feeling some ""serious stuff"", including a constituent who urged him to take action.

""His wish was that if there was a way to give some kind of a closure to the families... That would be one way for him to be able to say that he has done his share, even though his ancestors may have not done the right thing,"" said Mr Anwar.

The government's 2% pay offer to civil servants has been described as a ""slap in the face"" by a worker for the police watchdog.

""If you had said 12 years ago that we would be in this state, no-one would have believed you.

""This (2% offer) has been the straw that broke the camel's back.

152;152;3071;3071;Revealed: How Netflix plans to stop you sharing your password;Wednesday 1 February 2023 11:37, UK;[];['netflix'];['revealed', 'phone', 'account', 'sharing', 'using', 'streaming', 'dont', 'netflix', 'stop', 'plans', 'device', 'password', 'devices'];"Netflix's impending crackdown on password sharing includes plans to force users to regularly connect via their home Wi-Fi.

An update to the streaming giant's help page reveals details of how the company will finally take a tougher stance against the practice, which millions of people in the UK are estimated to partake in.

While logins will still be shareable within a single home, Netflix has outlined new measures to ensure that any device which uses the account is associated with the account holder's primary location.

Who will I be able to share my account with?

People within your home can still use your account - so if mum or dad are paying, but the kids are still at home, they can have their own profiles and watch Netflix on their own devices as they do now.

But if the kids have gone to university or moved out, maintaining access to their parents' Netflix will get trickier.

That's because by using information such as IP addresses, device IDs, and account activity, the company can detect where users are logging in from and may choose to intervene if they suspect a case of freeloading.

How is this going to be enforced?

Netflix will treat devices which use your account as trusted if they are connected to your home Wi-Fi regularly.

Advertisement

So don't worry, you can of course still take your Netflix account with you on your phone when you go out, assuming that you bring it back home with you and log in there at least once every 31 days.

But if a device from outside your household signs in or is used persistently, Netflix says it may ask you to verify that device before it can be used to watch anything.

How streaming services could change in 2023

What sort of verification?

Netflix says it will send a link to the email address or phone number associated with the primary account holder, containing a four-digit code that will need to be entered on the untrusted device within 15 minutes.

This ""may be required periodically"".

And this will also be needed of you if you are away from your home for an extended period of time, for example if you take your phone travelling and plan to keep using Netflix.

So I can still share my account?

Technically, yes, it's just becoming a lot more inconvenient, riskier, and could end up costing you.

Firstly, don't forget Netflix limits how many devices can be using one account simultaneously depending on which pricing tier you're on, and it maxes out at four at £15.99 per month.

Even if the prospect of constant verification code messages or someone swinging by to use your Wi-Fi isn't inconvenient enough, Netflix may still act if it suspects blatant password sharing is going on.

Those who are logging in from outside the household will either have to pay up for their own account, or the original account holder will need to spend a little extra.

Netflix has been trialling a feature to let people add subaccounts for up to two people they don't live with. It's been testing in parts of South America since last year and costs the equivalent of an extra £2-£3 a month.

Why is Netflix doing this?

Netflix started talking tough on a potential password sharing crackdown during a lull in subscriber numbers.

With more competition from the likes of Disney+ and Amazon Prime, and the cost of living crisis, the company was looking for ways to reverse the trend and boost revenue.

It started trying to tempt account sharers to make the move of their own accord last year, by letting people transfer profiles from one account to another.

The Intellectual Property Office has since ruled that password sharers are breaking copyright law - it's just down to the streaming services themselves to enforce it.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201153119/http://news.sky.com/story/revealed-how-netflix-plans-to-stop-you-sharing-your-password-12800510;6

The source told Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby that Mr Sunak was made aware of Mr Raab's conduct but the PM was never ""directly told"" about specific issues.

Downing Street has said Number 10 officials never advised the PM against appointing Mr Raab.

Asked whether Mr Sunak was made aware of Mr Raab's ""unacceptable behaviour"" last summer before he started appointing his top team, the PM's press secretary said: ""The PM was not aware of any formal complaints at the time of appointing Dominic Raab.""

Sunak attacked for how he handled two Tory controversies - politics latest

The press secretary added that she ""can't comment on any private investigations that may or may not have happened"" involving Mr Sunak.

Pressed further, she said: ""I don't know what your definition of informal complaints is. The PET (propriety and ethics team) processes are very clear.

""The appointments and usual processes were followed and we were not aware of any formal complaints.""

Mr Sunak has been urged to suspend the deputy prime minister while an investigation into bullying allegations is carried out.

The three permanent secretaries who led officials working under Mr Raab are thought to have given evidence to an inquiry into the deputy PM which is being led by senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC.

A total of eight formal complaints are believed to have been made.

Mr Raab has previously insisted he has ""behaved professionally at all times"" amid the allegations of bullying and intimidating behaviour.

At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir Starmer branded Mr Sunak ""weak"" for keeping Mr Raab in his role.

The deputy PM was sat next to Mr Sunak in the Commons.

Sir Keir asked the PM if he was ""completely unaware of serious allegations of bullying"" against the deputy PM before he appointed him.

Mr Sunak replied: ""The honourable gentleman ask these questions about what was known and I followed due process, I appointed an independent adviser as soon as I was made aware of new information.""

Probing further, the Labour leader continued: ""According to recent reports, some of the complainants were physically sick. One says they were left suicidal.

""How would he feel if one of his friends or relatives was being forced to work for a bully, simply because the man at the top was too weak to do anything about it?""

The PM replied: ""When I was made aware of formal complaints I instructed a leading independent KC to conduct an investigation because I take action when these things happen.""

Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby said the latest source allegation regarding what Mr Sunak knew about Mr Raab's behaviour ""will be worrying for those in Number 10"".

She said recent scandals - including the one involving former Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi's taxes - have cut through with the public and by focusing on these, ""Sir Keir Starmer is hoping to keep up the appearance that Rishi Sunak's government is mired in sleaze"".

Yesterday, Jacob Rees-Mogg warned that people are getting ""a bit snowflaky"" about bullying allegations levelled at government ministers.

The former cabinet minister told Sky News individuals should be ""careful"" when talking about accusations involving those including Mr Raab.

""It's a very difficult line to judge. It's not a straightforward issue in most cases. It's how did somebody react, what did somebody say, is it reasonable to demand from senior and well-paid professionals a level of good service?"" he said.

""And then you have to judge whether that line has been overstepped. But I do worry we are getting a bit snowflaky about this.""

Mr Rees-Mogg added that it is ""completely sensible"" for Mr Raab to remain in his position while the investigation into his conduct continues.

Education Secretary Gillian Keegan told Sky News she disagreed with Mr Rees-Mogg's comments.

Speaking to Kay Burley this morning, she said: ""Well, I mean, I don't agree with that. Bullying is very serious.""

His remarks were also condemned by a civil service union chief.

Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, said: ""Even by Rees-Mogg's standards this is outrageous.

""A former leader of the House, trivialising bullying that we know has ruined lives and careers.""

Sky News understands Mr Raab has spoken to Mr Tolley once about the allegations but will need to again as they proceed to go through things department by department.

The cut off date for new allegations is understood to have not yet been decided.

The Liberal Democrats have called on the PM's new ethics adviser to open an investigation into what Mr Sunak knew.

The party's deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: ""Once again, it appears as though the prime minister is taking the public for fools and trying to wriggle his way out of giving a straight answer.



""If it turns out that the prime minister has indeed turned a blind eye to informal allegations of bullying, just so he can appoint who he wants to, it would be shameful.

""I don't look at any of that, I am having a ball,"" she says.

Pauline Kidner, who is the founder of Secret World Wildlife Rescue, told Sky News that a member of her team went to the scene near Burnham-On-Sea on Monday to find the swans dead on the ground beneath the pylons.

One swan was found still alive and, after assessment by the charity, was later released.

Pictures from the site showed one of the swan's heads had been separated from its body after it struck the power lines.

National Grid has told Sky News it is ""investigating as a matter of urgency"" and has experts assessing the site.

Ms Kidner said the power lines started to be replaced by National Grid last year - but birds are struggling to see them because ""there is nothing on these new ones"" to make them stand out.

She said: ""We want the National Grid to realise the urgency over this because of the amount of swans in the area. Something needs to be done.

""This is a wetland and it is a good area for swans.

""The power lines started to be replaced last year from Hinkley through to Loxton. Usually, National Grid will put things on the lines so birds can see them, but there is nothing on these new ones.

""When the swans collide with the line, it is an instantaneous death because of the power surge. They were literally blown apart.

""One swan found by the dead bodies was assessed and found to be uninjured. We believe it stayed because its mate was probably one of the dead ones.

""This one was released near a group of young and unpaired swans which winter on the moors.

""Even when this one was being released, three other swans flew over the lines demonstrating this is a flight path, but fortunately avoided them.

""With so many swans already lost through Avian flu, this is an added danger to them. So sad.""

Dog walker Natasha Johnston was mauled to death in Caterham and a four-year-old girl was killed in a back garden in Milton Keynes.

Before 2022, that would have been more than halfway to the average number of dog-related deaths, which sat at 3.3 from 2001 to 2021.

Then in 2022, the number shot up: 10 people were killed by dogs.

It’s too early to say whether the death rate is an anomaly or the start of a shocking trend - but experts say something has changed in the way humans and dogs interact.

What the numbers say

In the last 20 years, the number of adults needing hospital treatment after a dog bite has tripled.

The dog population has increased, but not enough to account for that huge jump - which means dogs are biting humans more than they used to. It's adults in particular where the change is seen.

Dr John Tulloch, a vet and epidemiologist at the University of Liverpool who researches dog-related injuries and deaths, said dog bite rates also vary widely by location.

Merseyside had the highest incidence of dog bites, along with Wakefield, Middlesbrough and the north east generally, while Greater London had the lowest.

""On the whole, the shared common feature is that they are areas with high levels of social deprivation,"" Dr Tulloch told Sky News.

Hospital data also shows most attacks happen at home: 80% when it comes to adults and 90% for children.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:32 Dog attack victim named as Alice Stones

What the numbers don’t say

When people are bitten at home, it’s likely by their pet or another dog known to them. This can make people reluctant to report it for fear of the dog being put down or criminal charges being laid for owning a dangerously out-of-control dog, Dr Tulloch said.

Rosie Bescoby, a clinical animal behaviourist, told Sky News it could be difficult to pinpoint what spurred fatal attacks when dogs are often quickly euthanised afterwards.

“What that means is we then have nothing to assess, so we can't assess the dog to determine what might have caused it.

“And we can't ever learn, really, from these fatal attacks because the biggest clue in the whole scenario is dead.”

Dangerous TikTok trends

Advice from unqualified dog trainers on TikTok could be fueling aggression, Ms Bescoby said, “because they give a kind of DIY approach to potentially quite dangerous problems”.

Take videos recommending choke chains, for example. People might use them to control a dog’s defensive behaviour when actually the animal is anxious or stressed, without addressing the root cause.

Instead, the tactic creates a “ticking time bomb” where the animal can only suppress its reaction for so long before “we get the explosion”, she said.

Social media has changed our relationship with dogs, Dr Tulloch said. It’s hard to define exactly how that is linked to an increase in dog bites, but he frequently sees videos of dogs on TikTok where they look stressed.

“There was a recent trend, for example, of people staring into their dog's eyes for as long as they possibly could.

“And in all of those videos, the dogs were looking really, really uncomfortable. And it would not have surprised me if any of those videos had ended in someone being bitten.”

Photos of babies placed in dogs’ beds may look cute, Dr Tulloch warned, but parents risk upsetting the dog and putting their child in harm’s way if the dog is stressed by having its space invaded.

Pandemic puppies

It’s difficult to quantify the effect of the pandemic, but lockdown could have changed the relationship between dogs and their owners, Dr Tulloch said.

With people at home more - even after lockdown ended - a dog might have lost the safe space it retreated to when stressed, potentially leading to more frustration and anxiety. Opportunities for socialising dogs were also lost.

The demand for puppies in lockdown led to poor breeding, Ms Bescoby said.

Puppies who were not from “behaviorally solid dogs” may show behavioural problems, while unhealthy dogs “are much more likely to suffer and feel stressed and frustrated”.

Attack warning signs

When a dog bites, it’s the “last resort”, Dr Tulloch said. It’s likely the dog will have shown warning signs it’s anxious or uncomfortable.

“It could be smacking its lips or showing the whites of its eyes, or sort of further down the line would be showing its teeth.”

He stressed how important it is not to leave children alone with dogs as a child will not be able to read the warning signs a dog is uncomfortable as well as an adult.

Deed not breed

There’s a compulsion to fixate on the breed of dogs when attacks happen, Ms Bescoby said, but it is better to focus on “deed not breed”.

“The Dangerous Dogs Act and the prohibited breeds on it haven't reduced dog attacks. It's not the answer,” she said.

Dr Tulloch agreed: “One thing that I would say is that any breed is capable of biting.”

It’s difficult to draw conclusions about how and if breeds correlate to attack rates because dog population statistics are “very poor” overall and in the vast majority of attacks are not noted on medical or death records.

While larger, strong dogs may have the power to do more damage, Dr Tulloch noted that people have had “very significant injuries from very small dogs”.

How to reverse the trend

Dr Tulloch wants dog attacks to be seen as a public health crisis, but said because they don’t clearly fall under anyone’s remit nobody in government has taken it on.

“It can't just be just education or just legislation is going to have to be a combination of things and ensuring … consistent messaging and everyone's on the same page with it.”

There are some simple fixes, he said, such as banning letter boxes from ground height to prevent some of the 32 attacks on postal workers that happen each week.

Ms Bescoby said breeding and importing dogs needed attention, as well as how the dog training industry is regulated because at the moment anyone can call themselves a behaviourist and potentially give out harmful advice.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201182430/http://news.sky.com/story/why-dogs-attack-from-tiktok-trends-to-lockdown-habits-what-could-be-behind-the-rise-in-fatal-dog-bites-12800551;3

The Tory MP was prime minister when the bishop of Liverpool published recommendations five years ago - aimed at ""ensuring the pain and suffering of the Hillsborough families is not repeated"".

Ninety-seven football fans died as a result of a crush at an FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989, with police failures covered up in the aftermath.

Politics live: Rishi Sunak doubles down over handling of Tory controversies

An official police apology was published on Tuesday, however the lack of response from the government has been heavily criticised by the report's author, families of victims, and politicians.

During a debate on the issue on Wednesday, the policing minister Chris Philp said that a government response is expected to be published in spring.

But Mrs May responded: ""Can I say first to my right honourable friend, saying vaguely that the government's response will be available this spring, I do not think is good enough. Five years on, the government must publish its response.""

The Maidenhead MP added that while the apology from the police is welcome, ""frankly, it would have been far better for them to have done their job properly on that fateful April day, 34 years ago"".

She pressed Mr Philp on the introduction of an independent public advocate, whose role would be to help the bereaved in the event of major future tragedies.

Hillsborough campaigners say this would help build trust in the legal system and Mrs May promised the introduction of one in her 2017 manifesto.

The former Conservative minister Kevin Foster also raised this issue as he criticised the government's delayed response.

""The Hillsborough disaster was a tragedy. The lies, smears and cover-ups that followed were an absolute disgrace ... so the extended delay in getting this response out just makes it even worse,"" he said.

""Would he at least today commit to the principle of the independent public advocate to ensure that in future families would be on a level playing field?""

Mr Philp refused to commit in principle but pointed to a consultation on the measure which he said is ""under active consideration at the moment"".

""It is for the Ministry of Justice to publicly respond,"" he added.

Suella Braverman branded 'an absolute disgrace'

The debate was held in response to an urgent question from Ian Byrne, the Labour MP for West Derby in Liverpool, who asked when the Home Office will set out its response.

Home Secretary Suella Braverman was branded an ""absolute disgrace"" for not attending the debate after being sat in the chamber for Prime Minister's Questions earlier.

On Tuesday she said the government had not yet responded to the report because of active criminal proceedings relating to the tragedy, but her Labour counterpart Yvette Cooper said ""those finished 18 months ago and the work could have taken place even while those proceedings were ongoing"".

Ms Cooper said: ""Where is she [Suella Braverman] today, because previous home secretaries have shown the respect to the families and to the appalling ways in which they have been wronged by being here to respond and it is a devastating failure of responsibility and respect to them not to be here to respond"".

Calls for Hillsborough Law

An inquest jury ruled in 2016 that the Hillsborough victims were unlawfully killed amid a number of police errors.

The government has long faced calls to implement a ""Hillsborough Law"" which campaigners say would ensure fairer treatment of bereaved families after major tragedies.

In its response to the report on Tuesday, The National Police Chief Council (NPCC) committed to a new ""duty of candour"" but campaigners want this to be legally binding.

Mr Byrne, who was in attendance at the game in 1989 and witnessed Liverpool fans being crushed to death, said recommendations from the police ""did not go anywhere near far enough to change the culture we came up against in our quest for justice"".

""So I ask the minister, will this government do the right thing for future generations of our nation and implement a Hillsborough Law, containing Bishop Jones's recommendations with immediate effect?""

Speaking last week, ahead of his Africa trip, the head of the Catholic church said ""being homosexual isn't a crime"" - something described by an activist in Kinshasa, Scaly Kep'na, as a ""beautiful message"".

Francis also said that laws which criminalise homosexuality are ""unjust"", and that the Vatican should help put an end to them. ""It must do this,"" he said.

His comments ""mark an evolution of the church"", Mr Kep'na added.

There are 64 countries that still criminalise same-sex relations and Africa accounts for half of them, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association World (ILGA World).

Congo is an important destination for Francis, where about half of the 105 million population are Catholics.

A mass being held at Ndolo airport in the capital, Kinshasa, was expected to draw as many as two million of the faithful.

Africa is one of the few places in the world where the Catholic church is growing, both in the number of worshippers and individuals wanting to become priests.

This is Francis's fifth trip to the continent in his 10-year pontificate. He will be there until Sunday.

While it is unclear whether he will talk about homosexuality, Julia Mukuala, 38, a Congolese activist and member of the Pan-Africa ILGA Board, welcomed his recent comments.

""We think it will change the perception of all the religious people in our countries who think that when you are homosexual, you are to be slaughtered, to be dehumanised, you are devils,"" she said.

Her organisation put up a large banner in Kinshasa on behalf of the Congolese LGBT+ community, decorated with a rainbow flag and a welcoming message to Pope Francis.

Not everyone sees the Pope's comments in quite such a positive light, however.

""The Holy Father is far from being a supporter of homosexuality,"" said Father Alain Difima, head of Kinshasa's Catholic abbots.

He added that the Pope ""simply wanted to show that a person who practices homosexuality is still capable of remaining in society"".

Father Difima continued: ""It's his way of giving a chance to a homosexual person whom the world sees as a criminal.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201182430/http://news.sky.com/story/lgbt-activists-welcome-pope-to-congo-as-he-dismisses-anti-gay-laws-12800746;5

'This is not uncommon'

Ms Davies-Jones first spoke about the impact of Tate during Prime Minister's Questions last month, asking Prime Minister Rishi Sunak what more could be done in the Online Safety Bill to tackle his influence on school children.

Speaking to Sky News on Wednesday, she said: ""Sadly, we know that this is not uncommon though, and Andrew Tate is one of many individuals who are perpetuating this sense of misogyny and sexism.

""And it varies greatly, from the traditional sexist tropes that we hear, from women belong in the kitchen and looking after a home and looking after a husband, to some really vile, misogynistic and damaging and harmful content.""

Ukraine's ""remarkable"" ability to train quickly means Western tanks could be in action in Ukraine before Russia launches an anticipated Spring offensive, according to a top American official.

The US Ambassador to NATO, Julianne Smith, said she could not believe the speed with which soldiers have understood and utilised military equipment over the course of the conflict.

Her comments come after the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine said the nation is preparing for a major escalation by Russia, possibly within the next two to three weeks.

Speaking to Sky News' international affairs editor, Dominic Waghorn, Ms Smith said: ""The one thing that's been unbelievable over the last year is the Ukrainian military's ability to train up on equipment and utilize it in real-time.

""The way they have condensed the period of training that is often required for the systems that we have given them is nothing short of remarkable.""

Asked whether Ukrainian forces will be adequately trained and equipped with Western weaponry within three weeks, she said: ""It depends on how fast we can train them up.""

The ambassador said: ""The goal is first and foremost to get the training underway as soon as humanly possible and that has started happening.

""We've got to train them up on the tanks that are coming and then we need to rapidly move those tanks and get them in the hands of military commanders on the ground.

Her mobile phone was found on a bench nearby and was still connected to a conference call when it was spotted.

Ms Bulley's dog, a springer spaniel called Willow, was found loose between the river and the bench.

Ms Bulley's parents, Ernest, 73, and Dot, 72, said her disappearance was out of character, and she was in good health and enjoying her job.

It does not appear that she fell into the river.

Her father told the Daily Mirror: ""There was no sign of a slip or falling in so our thought was has somebody got her?

""I asked the Sergeant from Fleetwood a few days ago, 'is there any chance of her being taken' and she said 'I don't think that's the case'.

""I said 'how can you know that?'. It's such an isolated area, the only way that has happened is if it was someone who knew her.""

He added: ""If the worst came to the worst and she was never found, how will we deal with that for the rest of our lives?""

She added: ""You want to hold on to the hope that no news is good news.

""But knowing Nikki, we just know that if she could be at home with her girls, we very firmly believe that's where she would be. Her family are everything.""

Another friend, Emma White, described Ms Bulley as ""the kindest, beautiful, lovely human being inside and out"", adding that her partner, Paul, was ""being strong as possible"" for the couple's two children, aged nine and six.

""We don't know why she's gone missing, where she is, we just want her home,"" she said.

Quoting religious scripture, she said: ""Let our memory of Tyre shine a light on the path towards peace and justice.""

Ms Harris also praised the ""courage and strength"" of Tyre Nichols's family at the 29-year-old's funeral.

""We mourn with you and the people of this country mourn with you.

""When I think of the courage and the strength of this family, I think it demands that we speak truth. This violence act was not in pursuit of public safety, it was not in the interest of keeping the public safe.

""Was he not also entitled to the right to be safe?""

She earlier offered her condolences to the family of Tyre Nichols who died three days after being beaten by police.

Celebrated civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton also called for the George Floyd Act to be passed and criticised the police officers who beat Tyre Nichols.

Recalling the death of Martin Luther King in Memphis 55 years ago when he was campaigning for the rights of black workers, he asked: ""In the city that they slayed the dreamer, what has happened to the dream?""

""Five black men who wouldn't have had a job in the police department, would not ever be thought of to be in an elite squad in the city that Dr King lost his life, not far away from that balcony, you beat a brother to death.

""There's nothing more insulting and offensive. You didn't get on a police department by yourself, the police chief didn't get there by herself. People had to march and go to jail and some lost their lives to open the doors for you.

""How dare you act like that sacrifice was for nothing,"" he said.

The families of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who were killed by police officers in 2020, are among hundreds of mourners in the church.

Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton is delivering the eulogy.

Photographs taken by Mr Nichols, as well as images of him as a child and doing his beloved hobby of skateboarding were shown to mourners along with a quote attributed to the 29-year-old: ""My vision is to bring my viewers deep into what I am seeing through my eye and out through my lens.""

The ceremony is taking place in Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church in Memphis with the church's celebration choir singing a chorus of ""we love you Tyre"" as mourners entered the church.

Mr Nichols's black coffin was draped with a white bouquet of flowers and a painting of Martin Luther King placed beside it.

Tiffany Randal, mother of 29-year-old Jalen Randle who was shot by a police officer in Houston in 2022, dedicated a song to Mr Nichols's family, saying: ""I pray that God heals your broken heart. We are fighting together.

""All the mothers all over the world need to come together and stop all of this,"" she said.

Mr Nichols, 29, was aggressively punched, kicked and hit with a baton by several Memphis police officers after he was pulled over in a traffic stop on 7 January.

Five police officers have so far been charged with second-degree murder and fired while two other officers were suspended from duty.

There were moments of reflection as music was played over speakers, including Amazing Grace and Over The Rainbow.

The vigil came after local people left flowers and poignant notes at the scene earlier today as the end-of-terrace house remained cordoned off.

A forensic tent had been set up in the garden with officers patrolling the scene.

""So it's showing just how little we're getting.""

Tom Herzmark, a temporary lecturer at Brunel University, said it was ""actually embarrassing to talk about my pay"".

""I had six different part-time contracts last year but my income was still below the tax-free allowance,"" he told Sky News.

The tax-free threshold is £12,570. Tom lives with a friend to save on rent but says his earnings still aren't enough to live on.

""I've had to make difficult decisions about when I spend my money. I don't go on holidays. I don't go to the pub. I don't buy coffees, because it's all too expensive,"" he said.

""I'm paying to do the job with the hope that I will get a full-time position.""

Strikes take toll on economy as widespread disruption forces many to stay at home

In Walthamstow, northeast London, seven-year-old Daisy Halford joined her father on the picket line.

Her father is a secondary school teacher. Daisy said: ""Our schools aren't getting enough money and the government is taking money from our schools.

""I would like to get more money for our schools.""

How much are workers demanding, and how much have they been offered? RMT members at Network Rail are seeking an above inflation rise and have been offered 5% for last year and 4% for 2023. The union's workers within train operators have demanded the same but have also been offered 5% for 2022 and 4% for the current year. Train drivers' union Aslef's members want an increase linked to inflation but have been offered 4% by the companies - all represented by the Rail Delivery Group. The Royal College of Nursing has indicated it would accept a 10% pay offer - having originally sought 19%. The government has stuck to the 4% recommended by the pay review body. Striking ambulance workers affiliated to the GMB union have rejected an offer of 4% and want ministers to make a better offer, without naming an actual figure. There are 100,000 civil servants belonging to the PCS union, in many different government departments. They are generally seeking 10%. Teachers belonging to the NEU want a ""fully funded above-inflation increase"" but the government has said it cannot afford that and has offered 5%.

Peter Jeffrey, 48, who teaches at a primary school in Byker, Newcastle Upon Tyne, said: ""I've not had a real pay increase for 10 years. I'm effectively earning less than I was a decade ago.

""Any future pay rise is to come out of school budgets, meaning I have to think whether anything I get will impact colleagues like teaching assistants or dinner ladies, as well as things such as school trips, pencils and books.

""That puts us in a very difficult situation.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201204717/http://news.sky.com/story/one-pay-cheque-away-from-homelessness-striking-workers-tell-their-stories-12800875;2

The Tom Jones song will no longer be sung at Wales national ground, which holds more than 70,000 spectators.

A Principality Stadium spokesperson said: ""Delilah will not feature on the playlist for choirs for rugby internationals at Principality Stadium.""

""Guest choirs have also more recently been requested not to feature the song during their pre-match performances and throughout games.""

They reiterated that the song was removed from its half-time entertainment and music playlist during international matches in 2015.

The lyrics of the 1968 ballad are at the heart of this controversy.

""Delilah"" is stabbed as her jealous husband discovers her frolicking with another man - the husband pleads for forgiveness of her dead corpse at the end of the song.

The Principality Stadium's spokesperson said: ""The WRU condemns domestic violence of any kind.

""We have previously sought advice from subject matter experts on the issue of censoring the song and we are respectfully aware that it is problematic and upsetting to some supporters because of its subject matter.""

In 2014, Dafydd Iwan - whose Welsh anthem Yma O Hyd is now sang around the stadium, said: ""A song about murder, it does tend to trivialise the idea of murdering a woman. It's a pity these words now have been elevated to the status of a secondary national anthem.""

However, in a letter to The Guardian he said: ""Banning songs is not something I would ever advocate - even if it was possible.""

Tom Jones has since responded saying people were taking the song too literally and rejected claims that it trivialised violence towards women.

""I know that some people will say, 'Oh, here we go, he's a terrible spoilsport,' but the truth is that that song is about the murder of a prostitute.""

Glasgow-based Hydrogen Vehicle Systems (HVS) is developing two prototype HGVs as part of a group which includes supermarket giant Asda.

The third member of the consortium is UK self-driving technology firm Fusion Processing.

The project is estimated to cost £12m, with one of the vehicles set to be fitted with a driver's cab and be tested on the roads, operating autonomously but with a driver at the wheel.

Another will operate without a driver cab and be evaluated on test tracks with a driver operating it remotely.

Through sensor technology, cameras, and artificial intelligence, it is hoped the vehicle will operate with a remote driver for some journeys.

HVS hopes the vehicles can help with issues in the haulage industry such as driver shortages.

It also claims the technology will improve driver quality of life by offering less intensive shifts and helping with work-life balance.

Self-driving vehicles will also reduce energy and tyre emissions by better managing acceleration and braking, it added.

Commenting on the announcement, Business Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""In just a few years' time, the business of self-driving vehicles could add tens of billions to our economy and create tens of thousands of jobs across the UK.

""This is a massive opportunity to drive forward our priority to grow the economy, which we are determined to seize.

""The support we are providing today will help our transport and technology pioneers steal a march on the global competition, by turning their bright ideas into market-ready products sooner than anyone else.""

The group effort must show a sustainable commercial service by 2025 and is being backed by the UK's Centre for Connected Autonomous Vehicles, a government funded project.

""Five black men who wouldn't have had a job in the police department... in the city that Dr King lost his life, not far away from that balcony, you beat a brother to death.

""There's nothing more insulting and offensive. You didn't get on a police department by yourself. People had to march and go to jail and some lost their lives to open the doors for you.

Shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy has written to her government counterpart, Michael Gove, pointing to the pledge he made when launching the levelling up white paper one year ago on Thursday.

And Mr Gove said he would ""publish an annual report analysing progress"" against the missions ""so that levelling up is subject to rigorous external scrutiny, including by parliament"".

Tyre Nichols' death screams for change but remains choked by the politics of policing James Matthews US correspondent @jamesmatthewsky Tyre Nichols wasn't alone. At his funeral, they read out a roll call of lives lost to police violence. Relatives of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others came to meet the family of its latest victim and mourn a loss that they know. Inside the church, it was the past shaking hands with the present and it grasped for change in future. Tyre's mother, RowVaughn, spoke with a voice weakened by the weeks of torment - and yet, the words of a grieving mum spoke strongest. She talked politics and the so-called George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. In this Memphis church, she was preaching to the converted. No one here doubts the need for change and a congregation will have felt its momentum in the wake of Tyre's death. But amidst the hope, where lies expectation? In reality, it probably rests on the same shelf as the George Floyd bill aimed at reform. The legislation was introduced in 2021, following the police killing of Mr Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, and is designed to restrict misconduct, racism and the use of excessive force by police. So far so straightforward you might think, given the victim history. But the bill hit the political buffers in the Senate after Republicans opposed it, arguing that it was flawed and would weaken an officer's ability to do a difficult job. Republican reluctance was reinforced by the lobbying power of police unions, which have long enjoyed a strong influence in the US Congress. As much as the death of Tyre Nichols screams for change, it remains choked by the politics of policing.

Tiffany Rachal, mother of 29-year-old Jalen Randle who was shot by a police officer in Houston in 2022, dedicated a song to Mr Nichols' family, saying: ""I pray that God heals your broken heart. We are fighting together.

Baldwin, 64, faces two counts of involuntary manslaughter stemming from the incident on the set of the Rust movie in October 2021.

He was formally charged with the offences by the Santa Fe District Attorney's office on Tuesday, alongside the film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed.

In a statement of probable cause, filed along with the charges, the district claimed Baldwin's ""reckless deviation from known standards and practice and protocol"" directly caused the fatal shooting.

Baldwin is set to appear at the Santa Fe Magistrates Court on 24 February at 10am local time for his arraignment hearing.

The Press Association news agency has said it understands the hearing is likely to be virtual.

In its report, the district attorney alleged the actor had shown ""wilful disregard"" for the safety of others in the days leading up to the incident and was not present for ""mandatory"" firearms training.

Instead, he had undergone a 30-minute on-set session, during which he was distracted by a phone call to his family, the district attorney said.

The statement added that on the day of the shooting, there were ""no less than a dozen acts, or omissions of recklessness"" on the set in the period prior to the incident.

""The evidence and statements documented in this affidavit confirm many instances of extremely reckless acts or reckless failures to act by Baldwin in a 10-day period,"" the statement read.

""Evidence clearly shows that none of the incidents or issues were addressed by Baldwin, in his position as actor or producer, to mitigate future occurrences of recklessness, correct reckless behaviour, or correct training deficiencies.

""Baldwin's deviation from known standards, practice and protocol directly caused the fatal death of Hutchins.""

Both Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will be ""charged in the alternative"" with the two counts of manslaughter, meaning that a jury would decide not simply if they were guilty, but under which definition of involuntary manslaughter they were guilty, the DA's office said previously.

The first charge can be referred to as involuntary manslaughter and requires proof of underlying negligence.

This charge also includes the misdemeanour charge of negligent use of a firearm, which would likely merge as a matter of law.

The second charge is involuntary manslaughter in the commission of a lawful act, which requires proof that there was more than simple negligence involved in a death.

Under New Mexico law, both charges are a fourth-degree felony and are punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 (£4,000) fine.

The second charge includes a firearm enhancement or added mandatory penalty, which makes the crime punishable by a mandatory five years in jail.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201233927/http://news.sky.com/story/alec-baldwin-to-make-first-court-appearance-over-fatal-shooting-of-halyna-hutchins-on-set-of-rust-this-month-12801090;5
