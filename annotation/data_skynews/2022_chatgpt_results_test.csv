I can empathise with his words as a previous cancer patient myself, and also as a frontline nurse, but I disagree with his judgment on “anti-vaxxers”. Those who have chosen not to have the vaccine do not all share the same mindset, and it is worth bearing this in mind before they are all excommunicated from society. My adult son is autistic and is unvaccinated by choice. His belief system may differ from most people’s, but as he is housebound due to crippling anxiety, hopefully he will not be much of a risk to himself or others. Let’s be civilised enough not to alienate him further. Of course, he might have chosen to forgo the Covid vaccine without the complexities of an autism diagnosis, but we cannot punish those who are fearful or those who wish to preserve their self-determination. There are other groups of people who take up hospital beds and who are judged as selfish by some due to lifestyle choices too. Where should we draw the line? I hope open discussion and respect can be maintained in the discourse. Name and address supplied • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1;1;1;6355;6355;Glorious chaos at Stamford Bridge shows City are too good for the rest | Barney Ronay;2022-01-02T20:22:26Z;['Barney Ronay'];['Chelsea', 'Liverpool', 'Football', 'Sport'];;"Well, there goes the league title. Happy new year everyone! But hey, what a way to go. For the second time in two-and-a-half weeks Liverpool came to London and played out a wild, impossibly moreish 2-2 draw against occasionally brilliant, occasionally flawed opponents. This was no doubt an agonising watch for Jürgen Klopp in self‑isolation; just as it was 90 minutes of full-body torture for Thomas Tuchel, who spent the afternoon leaping up like a furious clockwork woodpecker, combination-punching invisible demons, and at one point hurling a bottle of orange energy drink thrillingly into an advertisement hoarding.
For Liverpool a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge follows the 2-2 draw at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. And so the ledger will report four points dropped: the kind of matches where title races are lost, seasons bookended. And yet it didn’t feel like a day for regrets. A five-month extended victory lap for the reigning champions presents a problem for the Premier League and its broadcast partners. It might well reopen the question of exactly how City have managed to build this extraordinary position of strength, a squad with no weaknesses. Some will point to questions the Premier League feel have yet to be answered over resources and expenditure, questions that are designed, at bottom, to preserve competitiveness. City’s fans might reply by rolling their eyes and pointing to Chelsea’s own absent £100m striker. One thing is clear. Flawed teams produce brilliant games. Those spaces, the mis-steps, it’s where the oxygen gets in. And this was a game where amazing things just kept happening. On 56 minutes Liverpool’s defence cleared a corner high into the night sky, Diogo Jota took the ball as it bounced, scrabbled back to his feet under pressure, and laid the bail off to Mohamed Salah. From 35 yards Salah produced something hilariously good, a driven chip-shot that drew, in turn, an outstanding stretching leaping save from Édouard Mendy. In that moment this didn’t feel like a football match, more a kind of display, a trick-shot bonus feature, Evel Knievel leaping a row of municipal buses. In reality the idea that this match represented a title-race eliminator was always fanciful. Chelsea haven’t looked like contenders since the start of November. Liverpool had won six of their last eight, but will now be losing their first-choice attackers. And in the end, it’s not you: it’s them. It’s the unwavering excellence of Manchester City, a team that continue to make something very difficult look very easy indeed.
Stamford Bridge was a noisy, gusty place at kick-off. With Romelu Lukaku at home watching Real Madrid, Thomas Tuchel went with that infamous “other system” also known as the shape that won Chelsea the Champions League: seven primarily defensive players, plus three in attack to press and cover. The early exchanges were hilariously error-prone, culminating in Trevoh Chalobah stooping to head clear Diogo Jota’s pass and ending up with his nose grazing the turf, somehow, in defiance of all physical laws, heading the ball off his own shoelaces. The ball broke to Sadio Mané. He buried it.
If anything captures Liverpool’s edge of brittleness and brilliance it is the interaction between Trent Alexander-Arnold and Salah, arguably the outstanding single attacking combination in English football over the past decade. It was from there that Liverpool made it 2-0 with a startling moment of synchronised movement and passing physics. Salah started the move, funnelling the ball back to Alexander-Arnold. As Chelsea’s defenders slackened a little, Salah had already begun to sprint, sniffing out a sliver of space, a fault in the stitching. Alexander-Arnold released a wonderfully weighted, backspun pass straight into that same corridor. At which point Salah produced another perfect little miniature. His first touch stunned the ball into his stride. The second wasn’t a touch at all, but a feint, an opening of the hips that transformed Marcos Alonso into a kind of goal-doorman, dipping a knee, scrolling his hand, formally inviting Salah into the Chelsea six-yard box. The finish was effortless, a lifted dink-prod on the run. Mateo Kovacic pulled one back with another stunner. Everyone who has ever kicked a ball has caught one like this just the once – leaning back, adjusting his feet, punting it up and then back down in a perfect parabola to clank in off the far post. But not, perhaps, in a brutally tight Premier League game in front of the watching millions, with just one shot, one moment to catch the sun. Chelsea’s equaliser moments later came down that same Liverpool right flank. Frankly, it all seemed a little too easy. Salah lost possession. Alexander‑Arnold was caught dawdling in a half space. N’Golo Kanté was able to help the ball on for Christian Pulisic who conjured a fine finish of his own, arcing the ball over Caoimhin Kelleher with a perfectly lobbed instep touch.
And the fact is neither of these teams is at the level of City, whose football has a kind of light around it right now, something clean and perfectly ordered, who have won 11 games in a row by passing and moving their opponents into a state of exhausted impotence. It would be absurd to denigrate a team this good for being, in effect too good, for winning games in a way that is so beautifully planned and drilled it seems to creep ever closer to a place where variables are removed and the result is, in effect, inevitable. City are a thing of beauty, too. And on the ragged, thrilling evidence of Stamford Bridge, just too good for the rest.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/02/glorious-chaos-at-stamford-bridge-shows-city-are-too-good-for-the-rest;guardian;Sports;;5907

3;3;3;4039;4039;Arron Banks’s lawsuit against reporter a freedom of speech matter, court hears;2022-01-14T17:18:02Z;['Haroon Siddique'];['Arron Banks', 'UK news', 'Brexit', 'Russia', 'Newspapers', 'Media', 'National newspapers', 'European Union', 'Europe', 'Foreign policy', 'Politics', 'Newspapers & magazines', 'The Observer'];;The libel action brought by the multimillionaire Brexit backer Arron Banks against the Observer and Guardian journalist Carole Cadwalladr should concern “anyone who cares about freedom of speech in this country,” a court has been told. Banks, who funded the pro-Brexit Leave.EU campaign group has brought a defamation action against Cadwalladr over two instances – one in a Ted Talk and one in a tweet – in which she said the businessman was lying about his relationship with the Russian state. On Friday, the first day of the trial at the high court, in central London, Gavin Millar QC, representing Cadwalladr, said: “What my client said, she was legally entitled to say as part of a discussion about matters of the highest public interest.” Those matters were listed as campaign finance, foreign money and the use of social media messaging and personal data in the context of the EU referendum. Millar said Cadwalladr’s claims in the April 2019 Ted Talk were not new and had been covered by both her and other media organisations in the two preceding years without prompting legal action. He said the claim against her personally was an “attempt to stymie her investigative journalism about him and make other investigative journalists wary about pursuing theirs”. At a preliminary hearing in 2019, on the meaning of the remark about Banks made by Cadwalladr at the Ted technology conference and a related tweet, Mr Justice Saini concluded an average listener would have understood that: “On more than one occasion Mr Banks told untruths about a secret relationship he had with the Russian government in relation to acceptance of foreign funding of electoral campaigns in breach of the law on such funding.” Millar said Cadwalladr did not intend to allege that Banks had received funding from the Russian government. In written submissions, he also claimed that, at the time of her comments, Banks had “no meaningful reputation” to be seriously harmed because: The digital, culture, media and sport committee had found that he had misled parliament in respect of his relationship with Russian officials and had sought to hide the same. There had been widespread publicity about Banks’s relationship with the Russian state and “his dishonesty and prevarication in respect of that relationship”. Leave.EU and Banks had been the subject of enforcement action by both the Electoral Commission (EC) and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) in relation to their activities during the referendum campaign. He said Cadwalladr’s reporting represented “public interest journalism raising issues going to the heart of the integrity of British democracy” which materially contributed to the investigations by the EC and the ICO and for which she also won an Orwell prize and was shortlisted for a Pulitzer prize. On Friday, Banks was questioned about his connections to Russia. Asked about why he had previously suggested the Russians had invited him to a meeting with its ambassador when it was actually initiated by Andy Wigmore, Banks denied it was because the former explanation was more palatable, saying he had simply misremembered. He used a similar explanation for not previously remembering he had met the Russian ambassador more than once. In his written witness statement, Banks said Cadwalladr’s remarks had led to comments to his sons by fellow students and a teacher about their father and that someone had thrown a glass of water over him accusing him of bullying the journalist and selling his country down the river. He said she had given an impression that he was “a traitor to this country and to the democratic process. That crosses the line.” His barrister, William McCormick QC, claimed Cadwalladr’s defence was “extreme” and “wholly unrealistic” in that it would enable her to continue to publish false statements complained of. “To suggest this is issued in bad faith simply to stop her reporting is a complete misconception,” he said. The hearing is expected to last four days.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/arron-banks-carole-cadwalladr-libel-trial;guardian;Politics;;3591
4;4;4;6562;6562;Everton sign Dynamo Kyiv defender Vitaliy Mykolenko on four-year deal;2022-01-01T11:05:12Z;['Andy Martin'];['Everton', 'Transfer window', 'Football', 'Dynamo Kyiv', 'Sport'];;"Everton have confirmed the signing of the Dynamo Kyiv defender Vitaliy Mykolenko for an undisclosed fee, with the Ukraine international agreeing a four-and-a-half-year deal. The left-back has won 21 caps for Ukraine and was a key part of the team that reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2020.
Mykolenko said: “Moving to Everton is a big and important step in my life. I am 22 but I don’t feel like a youngster. I have experience of playing at European level and hope I will continue to improve as a player.” Mykolenko can also operate in central defence and as a wing-back and made his Dynamo debut aged 18, making his senior international debut a year later. He added: “I like to play on the front foot and get forward when I can. Modern football demands that full-backs are able to attack as well as defend. I think I am a versatile defender who can get up and down the pitch. But I believe desire and commitment are the most important attributes and I will aim to bring those qualities.” Mykolenko is expected to replace Lucas Digne, who has fallen out of favour with Raphael Benítez in recent weeks and has been strongly linked with Brighton and Chelsea. Meanwhile, Benítez has likened Dominic Calvert-Lewin to a new signing as the striker prepares to make his first appearance since August. The England international scored in the first three matches of the season, but a thigh injury and subsequent setback in his recovery has denied Everton his services until now. There will be a temptation, especially with Richarlison still sidelined by a calf problem, to put Calvert-Lewin in from the start at home to Brighton on Sunday. However, while Benítez is delighted to have last season’s leading scorer back, he has sounded a note of caution about placing too much expectation on him. “He’s a massive signing for us in the second part of the league,” he said. “If we bring him back and, a few weeks later, Richarlison, we have more options there, we can think of the second part totally different. I’ve explained before that one thing is match fitness that you can improve by playing games and the other thing is fitness.
“Fitness-wise he is getting better. Match fitness, we will see. Maybe he scores three goals in the first half and we don’t need to worry about his match fitness, but I think the issue will be how long he can play if he starts the game or, if he comes from the bench, how much impact he can have on the game. “We are considering all of these things but he is training really well and he is really happy because he is with the team and is ready to play and score goals.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/everton-sign-dynamo-kyiv-defender-vitaliy-mykolenko-on-four-year-deal;guardian;Sports;;6114
5;5;5;7082;7082;Golden Globes: No celebs? No broadcast? No future? The controversy surrounding the 2022 awards;Friday 7 January 2022 01:44, UK;['gemma peplow', '@gemmapeplow'];['benedict cumberbatch', 'denzel washington', 'golden globes', 'jason sudeikis', 'jennifer aniston', 'lady gaga', 'leonardo dicaprio', 'olivia colman', 'ricky gervais', 'scarlett johansson', 'succession', 'tom cruise', 'will smith', 'kristen stewart', 'steven spielberg'];['hfpa', 'celebs', 'emily', 'golden', 'members', 'broadcast', 'future', 'pic', 'ceremony', 'globes', 'best', 'controversy', 'hollywood', 'surrounding', '2022', 'awards'];"A new year in Hollywood usually means the likes of Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler getting ready to take down the great and the good of Tinseltown for the first and most raucous show of awards season.

But that's not the case for the Golden Globes in 2022.

The ceremony that kick-starts the awards race, usually the biggest in the run-up to the Oscars, is going to look very different after making headlines for all the wrong reasons in 2021, with criticism over diversity among its membership and allegations of inappropriate freebies being given to influence votes.

Despite the nominations being announced in December, the format of the 2022 show remains pretty unclear with just days to go.

Front-runners include Kenneth Branagh's Belfast, Jane Campion's Power Of The Dog and Steven Spielberg's West Side Story in the film categories, while Succession, The Morning Show and Ted Lasso are all nominated in several TV categories.

And Denzel Washington, Lady Gaga, Benedict Cumberbatch, Olivia Colman, Will Smith, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kristen Stewart, Jason Sudeikis, Brian Cox and Jennifer Aniston are just some of the stars nominated in the acting categories.

But will the winners accept their awards, virtually at least if not in person? Here's what happened in 2021 - and what has changed for 2022.

Membership criticism

In February 2021, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) - the organisation behind the Golden Globes - faced significant criticism after it emerged none of its members were black.

At the time, the voting body was made up of around 80 members, none of whom were black, a report in the Los Angeles Times found.

The HFPA quickly issued a statement to say it was working on ""an action plan"" to recruit black members and the ceremony went ahead in March rather than its usual January date, with the delay caused by the pandemic.

The Emily In Paris controversy

As well as diversity, questions were also raised around alleged discriminatory practices and whether relationships with Hollywood studios influenced the choice of nominees and winners.

The Los Angeles Times exposé reported on a ""culture of corruption"" at the HFPA, which included members ""exchanging votes for perks and access [to celebrities]"".

When it was revealed that the somewhat criticised Lily Collins series Emily In Paris - widely regarded as fun but lightweight - had scored two major nods, while Michaela Coel's critically acclaimed I May Destroy You had been snubbed, there was outcry on social media - even an Emily In Paris writer had something to say about it, writing an opinion piece for the Guardian.

In its report, the LA Times claimed that the Paramount Network, which produces Emily In Paris, had treated several Golden Globes voters to a lavish set visit that included a five-star hotel stay, with rooms costing about $1,400 (about £1,033) a night.

The backlash

In May 2021, the Globes' broadcast network, NBC, which had aired the awards for several years, said it would not be showing the ceremony in 2022.

Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise reportedly returned his three Golden Globe awards for his roles in Jerry Maguire, Magnolia and Born On The Fourth Of July in protest.

And Scarlett Johansson said she would no longer work with the HFPA unless it made significant changes, while platforms including Netflix, Amazon Studios, WarnerMedia and dozens of Hollywood's top publicity companies also called for reform.

Sky News understands that Netflix still does not believe the HFPA has gone far enough in its reforms, and that it did not enter any of its content for submission, despite the numerous nominations.

HFPA member Husam Asi gave a rare interview to Sky News, admitting a need for reform and saying bosses should be held accountable for the lack of diversity in the organisation.

Audience numbers for the ceremony had plummeted to less than six million US viewers - down from 18.4 million in 2020 - following a difficult year for the industry caused by COVID restrictions.

After particularly scathing take-downs by host Gervais in 2020, and the poor viewing figures in 2021, could the controversial history of the HFPA be the final nail in the coffin? Is real change in Hollywood on the horizon? Or will this be a one-off?

What's changed?

The HFPA says it has worked ""tirelessly"" to make change and has ""completely overhauled its bylaws, implementing sweeping changes from top to bottom addressing ethics and code of conduct, diversity, equity and inclusion, governance, membership and more"".

The organisation said it admitted its largest and most diverse class to date in October, with 21 new and ""predominantly diverse"" journalists joining as members, and almost half its members are women.

""There are now people of colour involved in decision-making throughout the organisation - from major board decisions, to credentialing and selecting new members,"" it has said.

It has also brought in a ban on gift-giving from studios to its membership, in an effort to stop them apparently trying to influence the board.

Where and when does the ceremony take place?

Image: Few details have been released about who might be attending this year's ceremony

Despite the backlash this year, the HFPA has pressed ahead with the awards and the ceremony will be held at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, starting at 6pm local time on Sunday (2am on Monday in the UK).

Who's hosting?

That, we don't know. Details are yet to be released, if there is even a host at all.

How can I watch?

Again, we don't know. Still waiting for the HFPA to get back to us on that one. With NBC dropped the ceremony and no other broadcasters coming forward to pick it up, we're not sure - watch this space.

Which celebs will be there?

You might be sensing a pattern here... we don't know. Hollywood stars have been largely silent on the nominations this year, and the HFPA - usually keen to highlight in advance the vast array of celebs confirmed for the red carpet - has not provided details.

However, it has confirmed there will be no red carpet this year, which gives the impression it's going to be a low-key night.

Sky News has contacted several nominees to see if they will be accepting their awards, even if only through social media.

But we do know who's nominated!

This, we can tell you. The films up for best drama are Belfast, CODA, Dune, King Richard and Power Of The Dog, while Cyrano, Don't Look Up, Licorice Pizza, tick, tick... BOOM! and West Side Story are in the running for best musical or comedy.

In the TV categories, Lupin, The Morning Show, Pose, Squid Game and Succession are nominated for best drama, while The Great, Hacks, Only Murders In The Building, Ted Lasso and Reservation Dogs make up the shortlist for best musical/comedy series, and Dopesick, Impeachment: American Crime Story, Maid, Mare Of Easttown and The Underground Railroad all have nods for best motion picture.

For more on the nominees, see our complete list here.

What about COVID?

Image: Jason Sudeikis wore a hoodie to appear virtually at the Golden Globes in 2021, due to COVID-19

The rise of the Omicron variant has spoiled the party even more. The HFPA has said there will be no audience at the ceremony, with precautions being taken for ""select members and grantees"" who will be in the room.

They will need proof of vaccination and booster shot, along with a negative PCR test within 48 hours, and all guests will have to wear masks and be socially distanced.

What else has the HFPA said?

Image: Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon star in The Morning Show, which is nominated for best TV drama. Pic: Apple TV+

Not much. In a statement confirming when the winners will be announced, it said that in addition to the awards the ceremony ""will shine a light on the long-established philanthropy work of the HFPA"".

The organisation has donated $50m (about £37m) to more than 70 entertainment-related charities, film restoration, scholarship programs and humanitarian efforts over the past 25 years, ""many of whom were hit hard over the last two years as a result of the pandemic"", it said.

During the event, Kyle Bowser, senior vice president of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People) Hollywood Bureau, will discuss the Reimagine Coalition - a joint five-year initiative to increase diversity, equity and inclusion across the global entertainment industry.

""Each year the HFPA and the NAACP Hollywood Bureau will collaborate on, fund, and support a series of trailblazing initiatives, with the overall goals of ensuring visibility of projects from artists of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds; increasing diverse representation in the industry; and building pathways to inclusion for young artists and journalists of colour,"" the HFPA said.

6;6;6;1831;1831;Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers ponder futures after rough playoff exits;2022-01-25T13:08:42Z;['N/A'];['NFL', 'Tom Brady', 'Tampa Bay Buccaneers', 'US sports', 'Sport', 'Green Bay Packers', 'Aaron Rodgers'];;"Tom Brady says his family will play a crucial factor in deciding whether he returns to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next season. The 44-year-old has an impending decision whether he will retire or return for a 23rd overall and third season with Tampa Bay, whose bid to repeat as Super Bowl champs ended with a 30-27 loss to Los Angeles Rams in the playoffs on Sunday. Brady has one year remaining on his contract and has said in the past he’d like to play until he’s at least 45. “I think as I’ve gotten older, I think the best part is, is football is extremely important in my life, and it means a lot to me, and I care a lot about what we’re trying to accomplish as a team and I care a lot about my teammates,” Brady said on his Let’s Go! podcast with Jim Gray. “The biggest difference now that I’m older is I have kids now, too, you know, and I care about them a lot as well. They’ve been my biggest supporters. My wife is my biggest supporter. It pains her to see me get hit out there. And she deserves what she needs from me as a husband, and my kids deserve what they need from me as a dad.” Tampa head coach Bruce Arians said on Monday that no date has been set for Brady to make his decision, and the quarterback himself said he was in no rush to decide his future.
“Every year I just have to make sure that I have the ability to commit to what the team really needs, and that’s really important to me,” Brady said. “The team doesn’t deserve anything less than my best. And if I feel like I’m not committed to that, or I can’t play at a championship level, then you gotta give someone else a chance to play. And, you know, we’ll see. There’s a long time between now and the start of next football season.” Brady is aware of one important point as he takes time to ponder his future: the Buccaneers roster next season is likely to look a lot different with or without the seven-time Super Bowl winner. Unlike last spring when the Bucs defied the odds by retaining every starter from a star-laden lineup that won the franchise’s second NFL championship, general manager Jason Licht and coach Bruce Arians are not in a position to replicate that. Nearly half the roster is eligible for free agency, including wide receiver Chris Godwin; tights ends Rob Gronkowski and OJ Howard; running backs Leonard Fournette, Ronald Jones and Giovani Bernard; linebacker Jason Pierre-Paul; cornerback Carlton Davis; safety Jordan Whitehead; defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh; offensive linemen Ryan Jenson and Alex Cappa; and defensive lineman William Gholston. Arians said the goal as usual is to “reload” rather than rebuild, with an emphasis on re-signing as many of their own free agents as possible. “We’ll see how many we can get back and then build the team from there. ... Each year is so different and so new,” the coach said. “Last year, to get everybody back was amazing. Doubt we can do it all again this year, but we’re sure going to give it our best.” Meanwhile, an offseason of unknowns has begun at the home of another star quarterback. The Green Bay Packers are unsure of future hall of famer Aaron Rodgers will remain with the team next season, seek another team or retire. As opposed to the controversial offseason of a year ago when a disgruntled Rodgers and his only professional team seemed destined for a split, Packers head coach Matt LaFleur made it very clear on Monday that the team want their 17-year veteran to return for 2022. “Every conversation that I’ve been involved in with Gutey [general manager Brian Gutekunst] and Russ [director of football operations Russ Ball] and Mark [president Mark Murphy], we’re all on the same page there,” LaFleur said on Monday. “There’s no debate.” Speaking to the media on the heels of Green Bay’s 13-10 upset loss Saturday against the San Francisco 49ers, LaFleur said he met with his quarterback on Monday and while a decision was far off, there was no question the Packers organization hopes for a return. “I sat down and talked to Aaron today for quite some time,” LaFleur said. “I think we’re all a little numb to the situation right now and, so, I would say that what we talked about, I’m definitely gonna keep between him and myself, but we’re hopeful that he’ll be back next year, obviously.” The 38-year-old Rodgers did not disappoint this season, tossing up elite numbers (4,115 passing yards, 37 touchdown passes, four interceptions) for what may turn out to be the fourth MVP season of his career. But he admitted after an unspectacular performance on Saturday against the Niners (20-for-29, 225 yards) that while he will not drag out a decision about his future past the start of free agency on 16 March, he also doesn’t plan to stick around if the team decides to start from scratch. “I don’t want to be part of a rebuild if I’m going to keep playing,” Rodgers said of the Packers. The Packers are projected to be $44.8m over the 2022 salary cap. Wide receiver Davante Adams has said publicly he wants to be the NFL’s highest-paid wide receiver and said last year there will be no hometown discount to stay in Green Bay. To keep Rodgers, the Packers would need to sign him to a long-term extension. His cap charge in 2022 is $46m, negotiated intentionally by Rodgers last offseason when his disdain for the front office came to light. The mood has since shifted. If it’s up to his head coach, there is no decision from the Green Bay standpoint as LaFleur said he wants the Packers to do “everything in our power to try to get him back here and making sure he’s comfortable with the direction of our football team.” “There’s no plan for a rebuild,” said LaFleur. “You get this close, obviously win a lot of football games, and we know in order for there not to be that, he’s gotta be a part of this thing. I don’t think that’s anybody’s intention.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/25/tom-brady-aaron-rodgers-future-retirement-packers-buccaneers-nfl-football;guardian;Sports;;1381
7;7;8;4007;4007;A Tory party mired in scandal can’t fix the NHS – but a Labour government can | Keir Starmer;2022-01-14T19:00:02Z;['Keir Starmer'];['NHS', 'Health', 'UK news', 'Labour', 'Politics'];;"The next Labour government will build a new Britain based on security, prosperity and respect. To do that, we must renew the very foundations of our country. That will begin with renewal of the health service. The NHS must be resilient, able to meet the challenges of the future, and focused on prevention as well as cure. It must be there to protect us in the future, rather than requiring us to protect it in the present. It is to the country’s great misfortune that at this crucial time we have a Conservative government yet again mired in scandal, led by a prime minister who is out of control, out of touch and out of ideas. Senior cabinet ministers are spending their days plotting how and when to dispose of him. Precious time is being wasted on the latest internal psychodrama of the Tory party instead of sorting out the mess they have made. Nowhere is that mess more profound than in the health service. Twelve years ago, the Tories inherited a strong NHS from Labour. Waiting times were the shortest on record. Today they are the highest since records began. Across the country, people are struggling to see a doctor, get the care they require or have a much needed operation. The claim from the government benches that all the NHS’s ills are down to Covid is simply not true. Waiting times were on the rise long before the virus showed up. Life expectancy had stalled. We went into the pandemic short of 100,000 staff in England and with patients unable to be discharged from beds. Lockdowns were necessary to stop the NHS falling over – but the reason it was in such a perilous state was because the Tories had made it so. Without a great renewal, the NHS will continue to be vulnerable to new variants and new viruses. That, in turn, will leave the country vulnerable. This is unsustainable. Lockdowns come at enormous cost to people’s lives and health, and the country’s economy. Being forced into a hokey-cokey of restrictions will only do more harm in the long term. Instead we must fix the damage the Tories have done, to make the NHS more resilient again. That means investing properly. Labour would get waiting lists down by getting staff numbers up: recruiting, training and – crucially – retaining the staff we need. We would treat care workers with respect by giving them real job security and rewarding them properly. And we would transform social care to give older and disabled people the support they need to live the life they choose. Our focus will be on the sort of renewal that has only ever been possible under Labour governments. Just as the Blair government refocused the health service on outcomes, we would switch the focus from simply treating illnesses to preventing them. When I was director of public prosecutions, hardly a case came across my desk where early intervention couldn’t have turned lives around before they unravelled. The same is true in health.
Achieving this sort of change means rethinking how the healthcare system works. It will require us to focus on the patient rather than just the system, the community as much as the community hospital. If we are to keep people well and at home we must strengthen those services that in turn strengthen entire communities, such as adequate mental health provision. The NHS needs to be properly funded but, simply throwing money at the problem isn’t the answer. Instead, we need to think radically about how the NHS can deal with the challenges of the future. We would be forensic with investment. Technology has the potential to transform how we live and manage our lives, while also reducing pressures. It will be possible to get early warnings about diseases we may be vulnerable to. “Hospital at home” systems will allow patients to track and report their conditions, with remote supervision. Tackling the immediate crisis, future-proofing the NHS and shifting our focus to prevention is all part of Labour’s new contract with the British people. It will provide the security that comes with knowing the health service will be there for you and your loved ones when you need it. It will increase our nation’s health and wellbeing, giving us all the chance to prosper. And it will provide people with the dignity and self-respect that come with being able to have control over your own life. The Tories don’t get any of this. They think it’s enough for the NHS to merely survive. Under Labour, the NHS – and Britain – will once again thrive.

8;8;9;2708;2708;Female leadership is good for the world. Just look at Barbados;2022-01-21T07:45:25Z;['N/A'];"[""Women's rights and gender equality"", 'Global development', 'Barbados', 'Trinidad and Tobago', 'Climate crisis', 'World news', 'Environment', 'Americas', 'India', 'Liberia', 'Ellen Johnson Sirleaf', 'Caribbean', 'Africa', 'South and central Asia', 'Mia Mottley']";;"There is a common misconception that the developing world is full of archaic values and that women struggle to have their voices heard. The more countries I visit and the more female leaders I speak to, the more I am convinced the contrary is true. In fact, those in positions of power worldwide could learn important lessons from these strong women when it comes to tackling some of society’s most pressing issues, including pandemics, the climate crisis, education and infrastructure.
Of course, successful female leadership in the developing world isn’t new. During her time as prime minister of India, Indira Gandhi was famously strong. In Africa, I met the highly respected former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who was recognised among Time Magazine’s Top 100 Women of the Year in 2020 for her role in picking up the pieces of a damaged nation when she was elected in 2006. I am writing from South America and the Caribbean, having interviewed many female leaders, most recently from Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. The level of respect for female political and business leaders here is partly because they have had to dig deeper to prove themselves, which I believe is one key to their success – particularly during turbulent times. Since taking up office, Barbadian prime minister Mia Mottley has changed the face of democracy in the country. She has been transparent, stands up publicly against injustices, and has created authentic ties between Caribbean countries. It is difficult to overstate what her commitment to collaboration across the region and internationally has done for Barbados, securing investment and developing infrastructure to enable a stable and sustainable economy during the Covid crisis. Countries like Barbados are often not the protagonist, yet Mottley put issues such as the climate crisis and international development to the front on the world stage. Such is the level of support for Mottley within the region that it is not uncommon for the president of Guyana, Irfaan Ali, to wake up at 5am to cook his famous fish curries and have them delivered by the next flight, as a gesture of care and support for her. I have also been struck by the role a “first lady” can play in sharing leadership. In Suriname, Mellisa Santokhi-Seenacherry has helped ensure that, through government policy, no one is left behind. A successful lawyer, she has promoted female leadership, empowerment and mental health with rigour. Guyana’s first lady, Arya Ali, has brought family back into the state house and work. She is committed to inclusivity, setting up countrywide schemes that support women and girls, those with disabilities and children, and is not afraid to look at the challenging issues of domestic violence and rape. This takes courage and heart – and she has these in abundance.
In other spheres, Guyana’s Annette Arjoon has been widely recognised for her environmental and community work. Arjoon is responsible for establishing one of the country’s first, and most successful, conservation NGOs, the Guyana Marine Turtle Conservation Society – leading the way in preserving the natural environment for future generations. Trinidad and Tobago has this form of leadership in the private sector – the representation of female CEOs is greater here and in Jamaica than in the US. Trinidad and Tobago Business Hall of Fame award winner Angela Lee Loy continued to invest in training her employees during Covid and supporting them through the challenges of home working, giving parents the flexibility to work around home schooling, for example. “I firmly believe that if their home life needs support, then that should be our domain and area of concern, too,” she says. This approach certainly paid off. Her staff have remained engaged and loyal. It is not easy, and there has never been a linear upward path for female leaders. However, the women highlighted here are courageously carving a path and are a brilliant example to the world. The unprecedented disruption of the past two years has thrown a spotlight on leadership. These women are finding solutions to pressing global challenges with purpose, passion and people at the fore, and are improving the lives of their communities through harnessing the very qualities that make female leaders so successful.

10;10;12;4509;4509;Colbert on Omicron: ‘Kinda sweet that we all gave each other the same thing for Christmas’;2022-01-12T16:46:29Z;['Adrian Horton'];['Late-night TV roundup', 'Stephen Colbert', 'Jimmy Kimmel', 'TV comedy', 'Comedy', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Television'];;"Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert observed another grim milestone in the two-year saga of grim Covid milestones for the US: on Monday, the US notched a record 1.5m new Covid infections due to the surge of the Omicron variant. “That is terrible,” the Late Show host said, “but kinda sweet that we all gave each other the same thing for Christmas”.
The US also saw a record-breaking 145,000 Covid hospitalizations, with experts predicting a peak in the 300,000 range, though the CDC has offered a clarification on that statistic. Its director, Rochelle Walensky, estimated that 40% of the patients hospitalized with Covid are not presenting because of Covid symptoms, but coming in for something else and then having the virus detected. “OK sure, but even if people aren’t coming in for Covid initially, the hospitals are still overflowing,” Colbert noted. “That’s like saying ‘uh, technically, up to 40% of the people who drowned on the Titanic were already wet because they were in the bathtub when the ship went down, so not so bad.’”
Meanwhile, America’s resident Covid expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, finally reached the end of his rope with antagonistic Republican lawmakers on Tuesday. During a congressional hearing, the White House’s top immunologist called out the Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky for misleading and baseless accusations. “What happens when he gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue, is that all of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there, and I have threats upon my life, harassment of my family with obscene phone calls, because people are lying about me,” Fauci said. “That’s just terrible. Dr Fauci should not be getting obscene phone calls from violent crazies,” said Colbert. “He should be getting them from lonely singles who saw his InStyle magazine cover.” Pointing to Paul’s campaign website, in which a donation tab is accompanied by a “Fire Dr Fauci banner,” Fauci also blasted Paul for “making a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain”. “A pretty damning accusation,” Colbert said. “In response, Rand Paul sent out an email: ‘Dr Fauci tried to smear me by saying I’m profiting from the pandemic. Prove him wrong by donating $10, $20, or $100 today!’” Jimmy Kimmel
And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel lamented pandemic fatigue, which has forced health officials to urge Americans not to catch Covid on purpose. “They have to tell us that? ‘Please don’t intentionally give yourself a deadly disease,’” Kimmel joked. “Here’s the thing: there are only so many doctors, and there are only so many nurses, and there are only so many hospital beds,” he added. “When everyone tries to get something all at the same time, it’s a disaster. Didn’t we learn nothing from the great toilet paper crisis of 2020?” In non-Covid news, the treasury department has predicted a “frustrating” tax season for the overwhelmed IRS, “which is a shame, because it’s normally so homey and warm”, Kimmel deadpanned. “It’s funny, you know, when the IRS is behind on getting their refunds to us, they take all the time they need,” he continued. “When we’re a day late paying them, they’re like ‘and which prison would you like to go to?’” According to the New York Times, the beleaguered department had fewer than 15,000 employees to handle more than 240m calls – that’s 16,000 calls per person – during the 2021 filing season that left over 35m unprocessed returns. “That’s why Trump never pays taxes,” Kimmel joked. “He knows how overworked these people are. It’s called being considerate.”";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/12/stephen-colbert-late-night-omicron;guardian;Entertainment & Culture;;4061
11;11;13;3700;3700;Where is Kazakhstan’s former longtime leader Nursultan Nazarbayev?;2022-01-16T14:07:49Z;['Shaun Walker'];['Nursultan Nazarbayev', 'Kazakhstan', 'South and central Asia', 'World news'];;"It is a question being asked with increasing urgency by intelligence services, multinational companies and most citizens of Kazakhstan: where is Nursultan Nazarbayev? Kazakhstan’s leader from 1991 until 2019, Nazarbayev has long been the arbiter of all business and political decisions in the central Asian nation, and the purveyor of an all-encompassing personality cult. In 2019, he handpicked a successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, while retaining power behind the scenes. The capital city, along with its airport and main university were all renamed after him. But since the worst unrest since independence broke out earlier this month, Nazarbayev has been silent and absent from public view. Official figures say 225 people died in the unrest and subsequent crackdown. Meanwhile, the man who personified Kazakhstan for so long has simply disappeared. Some said he was hiding out on the shores of Lake Geneva. Others suspected he had fled to Dubai. A few whispered conspiratorially that he may be dead. In fact, according to a number of sources, he remains in Kazakhstan, probably in the capital, Nur-Sultan, the city that bears his name. “My best information as of today is that Nazarbayev is alive, and furious negotiations are under way with Tokayev about the redistribution of assets, spoils and rents,” said a former western government official who is well connected in Kazakhstan. Tokayev, once a loyalist, has used the crackdown to strip power from his former benefactor and members of Nazarbayev’s family, some of whom are accused of using the protest mood in the country to unseat Tokayev and seize power. “The power struggle continues. There is no guarantee things will end smoothly,” the former western official said.
One source, claiming direct knowledge, insisted Nazarbayev is in China, but Yermukhamet Yertysbayev, a former minister and Nazarbayev adviser, said he believed his former boss was still in ~Kazakhstan. “Negotiations are ongoing, but it is clear the Nazarbayev era is over,” said Yertysbayev, adding that he blamed the recent violence on “reactionary and conservative forces from the Nazarbayev clan”. While Tokayev has not criticised the former leader by name, there are signs that the personality cult is over. A statue toppled during the riots has not been repaired; street signs for Nazarbayev Avenue that were pulled down in Almaty, the country’s largest city, have not been reaffixed. Authorities have arrested the former head of the security services, the Nazarbayev loyalist Karim Masimov, on charges of attempting to seize power. On Saturday, it was announced that two of Nazarbayev’s sons-in-law had been fired from their positions in key state companies. Other relatives are known to have fled the country. Many in the elite were now rushing to declare their loyalty to Tokayev, said one well-connected business source, adding that any purge would hopefully be limited to those in Nazarbayev’s family and inner circle. “Tokayev is a sensible guy and he knows how important the image of the country is. He will act smoothly and carefully. He will not spray bullets with a machine gun, he will pick people off accurately with a sniper rifle.” After the 2019 transition, it seemed Nazarbayev’s official status as “Leader of the Nation”, and his role as head of the powerful security council, meant his safety and revered status were guaranteed. Instead, the image that took 30 years to build has crumbled in the space of a few days. “Many people are moving from the Nazarbayev camp to the side of President Tokayev,” said Yertysbayev, who appeared to be engaged in exactly that manoeuvre himself, airing thoughts that would have been suicidal to utter publicly just a few weeks ago. “I think Nazarbayev didn’t watch the great film of Francis Ford Coppola The Godfather attentively enough,” said Yertysbayev. “There is no doubt that he is the father and founder of the Kazakh independent state, but he’s a living person and he has his minuses. And the biggest is his sentimental love for his family and clan. I think it’s unacceptable for a head of state.”
The pervasion of Nazarbayev family members and their associates through state companies and various money-making enterprises was something that others in the elite found grating, and is one reason why supposedly loyal figures have been willing to change their tune so quickly. The spectacle is likely to prove instructive for other autocrats in the region, notably the Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, both of whom were rumoured to be considering the “Nazarbayev option” as a transition scenario. Putin, whose current term expires in 2024, recently signed a law that would enable him to remain president until 2036, but analysts had also touted a Nazarbayev-like “father of the nation” role that would allow him a safe and prosperous retirement from frontline politics while retaining ultimate control. Suddenly, that looks a less secure option. Putin has thrown his weight behind Tokayev, offering him the military support of a Russia-led alliance to help regain control. It is likely that he made this support contingent on a safety guarantee for Nazarbayev. However, Putin will also have noted the speed at which Nazarbayev’s supposed devoted supporters deserted the former leader. “It will be used as an argument that no transition is possible, other than a transition from the current president to himself,” said Ekaterina Schulmann, a Moscow-based political scientist. In Kazakhstan, people are waiting to see whether Nazarbayev will ever appear publicly again, and whether Tokayev will fully disown his predecessor, resurrect the personality cult or simply remain silent. “We’ve had lots of small signals, but we are still waiting for the big one,” said Vyacheslav Abramov, the editor in chief of the vlast.kz news website.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/where-is-kazakhstans-former-longtime-leader-nursultan-nazarbayev;guardian;Politics;;3251
12;12;14;6528;6528;Sands of time are slipping away for England’s crumbling coasts amid climate crisis;2022-01-01T17:00:07Z;['Andrew Anthony'];['Climate crisis', 'Norfolk', 'UK news', 'Science', 'Wildlife', 'Environment', 'Flooding', 'Coastlines'];;"From a distance, the beach at Winterton-on-sea in Norfolk looks like the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, with hundreds of grey bodies lying motionless across the sand. On closer inspection, it becomes clear they are not fallen soldiers but a huge colony of seals taken to the land for pupping season. It’s an amazing annual sight that draws tourists and nature-lovers from across the country, but another process is taking place that is pushing people back – the growing threat of coastal erosion. Just along from where the armies of grey seals lay with their white pups, there used to stand the Dunes Cafe, a much-loved beach facility with a large and loyal clientele. A year ago it was demolished to prevent its imminent collapse as a result of land lost to sea and storms. The ground where it stood is, like the cafe itself, no longer there. It’s a story of disappearance taking place all along the eastern coast of England, but particularly in East Anglia, that bulbous protrusion jutting into the North Sea. That climate change and rising sea levels take their toll on the landscape is an old story, but one with an urgent new twist. “The sea level’s been rising since the last ice age, 20,000 years ago or so,” says Jim Hall, professor of climate and environmental risk at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute. “And it’s going faster. We’re probably not seeing its effect very much yet on the coast, though we will in the future.”
A 2020 report by the Committee on Climate Change, on which Hall sits as an expert on coastal erosion and flooding, found 1.2m homes at significant risk of flooding and a further 100,000 subject to coastal erosion by 2080 – which, although it sounds safely distant, will be within the lifetime of most of those born so far this century. Two years ago, the US-based climate change research group Climate Central went further. It produced a map showing areas of the UK at risk of being underwater by 2050. They included sections of north Norfolk, all of the Lincolnshire coast and much of Cambridgeshire, along with parts of East Yorkshire, Merseyside and the Bristol area. According to the group, this would happen even if “moderate” attempts were made to combat climate change. Such predictions are based on highly complex, and disputed, modelling, yet there are significant warning signs that such an outcome is growing rapidly more plausible. Last month, scientists monitoring the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica, an ice shelf the size of Great Britain, warned it is in danger of collapse. “It’s being melted from below by warm ocean waters, causing it to lose its grip on the underwater mountain,” said Peter Davis from British Antarctic Survey and the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. He said research suggested that the ice shelf will begin to break apart within two decades. Should there be a complete collapse, it would lead to a highly consequential rise in sea levels of 60cm. That may be a worst-case scenario, but it will almost certainly have a notable impact on the British coastline.
In a sense Norfolk is a real-time lesson in how weather and sea can drastically alter a landscape. After the Dunes Cafe was dismantled, a chef called Alex Clare set up a mobile silver Airstream cafe to cater to locals and visitors at the car park next to where the cafe once stood. He’s had to move the Airstream four times in eight months, as sections of the dunes on which the car park sits have collapsed into the sea under pressure from storms and high tides. “In the last two weeks,” Clare told me, “a strip about as long as this caravan has disappeared. You hear about erosion, but you don’t know what it means, what it involves, until you witness it. And it’s a shock to see the physical transformation.” The car park owner has tried to slow the erosion by laying down large concrete blocks on the beach, but it’s the definition of a losing battle. Winterton’s coast possesses a bleak beauty, enhanced by the fact that the village sits back from the sea, behind a broad wall of dunes. By contrast, at Hemsby, a mile or so south, the town, with its amusement arcades and fairgrounds, stretches all the way to the shoreline. Four years ago, there was a line of seven chalets close to the edge of the sandy cliffs that drop down to the beach. They all had to be knocked down as the land beneath them began to fall into the sea. The local council is looking at sea defences, but the only workable answer involves large-scale investment and a major process of sandscaping. That is what took place at Bacton, 15 miles north along the coast from Winterton.
A four-mile-long dune was built to protect Bacton Terminal, which supplies around a third of the UK’s gas and had been moving steadily closer to the cliff edge, literally and metaphorically. Designed by the Dutch engineering company Royal HaskoningDHV, it involved the placement of 1.8 million cubic metres of sand along the beaches near the terminal. The design relies on the sand being shifted into place by wind, waves and tides. The Dutch are world leaders in land reclamation and protection, having over the years reclaimed more than a sixth of Holland’s landmass from the sea. “In the long run,” says Professor Hall, “any coast protection is temporary. We’ve been doing engineering to protect the coast for a very long time. Almost half of the UK coast has some kind of protection – sea walls, revetments, promenades, that kind of thing. The Victorians were inveterate promenade builders.” Such protections don’t stop the sea rising. They merely fix, for a while, the point of the shore profile. At Happisburgh, near Bacton, wooden revetments did that job, until they collapsed 20 years ago, leading to a sudden and damaging exposure to the sea. “Once you lose [the protection], there’s a lot of pent-up erosion capacity,” says Hall. Although there is growing media coverage of coastal erosion, it’s as Alex Clare said: knowledge of the thing isn’t the same as experiencing it. “There’s a bit more recognition that the sea level is rising fast,” says Hall. “But I don’t think coastal communities have really understood what the future holds.” He believes there should be an “honest conversation” between government, local government and the affected communities.
While the money required to protect cities like London and Hull will have to be found, that’s not likely with isolated villages. When I visited Norfolk last month, the locals seemed fatalistic or in denial, pointing out that the situation was worse somewhere else, either up or down the coast. As I drove back, it began to rain, and that night the weather deteriorated. The next day there was a large landslide at Mundesley, near Bacton, with a huge chunk of the cliff face collapsing on to the beach. Above it, houses stood on the precipice, their future looking about as secure as Norwich’s position in the Premier League. As Pete Revell, station manager at Bacton HM Coastguard, said, Mundesley was viewed as stable by comparison with nearby Happisburgh, and the landslide came as “a bit of a surprise”. It certainly shocked local resident Antony Lloyd, who said he was “very nervous and agitated about any further incidents.” He was finding it hard to sleep and thought he would have to move. Of course, the occasional landfall or loss of beachside chalets is hardly cause for national panic. But like canaries in a coal mine, the inhabitants of the villages strung along Norfolk’s shifting coastline are a warning of a worrying future. There are processes under way whose outcomes are unavoidable, and those that can potentially be arrested. But it will require unblinking foresight and long-term action, neither of which are our national strong suits. If you take the path north from Winterton’s beach car park you come to the roped-off seal sanctuary. Beyond, seals and their pups lie still and vulnerable in the dunes, hundreds of yards from the shore, as if waiting for the sea to rescue them. And come it will, not now or next year, but much sooner than we care to think.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/01/sands-slip-england-crumbling-coasts-erosion-rising-sea-levels;guardian;Environment;;6080
13;13;15;5796;5796;Britain’s stalling economy blamed on inflation and product shortages;2022-01-05T22:30:45Z;['Phillip Inman'];['Economic growth (GDP)', 'Inflation', 'Interest rates', 'Consumer spending', 'Economic recovery', 'Supply chain crisis', 'Economics', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Business', 'Small business', 'Global economy', 'Retail industry', 'Energy industry', 'Public finance', 'UK news'];;Britain’s economic recovery stalled before the arrival of the Omicron variant of Covid and the dampening effect of the government’s plan B restrictions on consumer spending in the Christmas shopping period, a wide-ranging company survey has found. Businesses blamed spiralling inflation and shortages of imported goods for a decline in sales in the fourth quarter, which meant that an expansion during the spring and summer ground to a halt. In a message that will concern the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the British Chambers of Commerce added that many respondents to its quarterly survey of almost 5,500 firms revealed that they were running low on cash and had ditched investment plans to stay afloat into the new year. Suren Thiru, the BCC’s head of economics, said sales growth stalled as firms struggled with the “mounting headwinds” of inflation, a scarcity of skilled workers, and problems sourcing products from overseas. “The persistent weakness in cash flow is troubling because it leaves businesses more exposed to the economic impact of Omicron, rising inflation and potential further restrictions,” he said. The survey also found that the prospect of Bank of England officials raising interest rates was another concern for firms that had taken on extra debt over the last 20 months to cope with the pandemic. The bank raised rates to 0.25% in December. A series of reports have shown the UK economy heading into a challenging spring, with a strong rise in consumer prices hitting household disposable incomes and denting consumer confidence. Official figures showed the consumer prices index (CPI) jumped to 5.1% in November following persistent increases in oil and gas prices and other commodities, including wheat and copper. Consumer spending has underpinned the recovery, accounting for more than 80% of the UK’s growth, while spending on government services such as the NHS has made up much of the difference. Only a minority of businesses have pushed ahead with spending on new equipment, buildings and machinery, despite the offer of tax subsidies on investment, made in the budget last March. In the second quarter of 2021 GDP growth hit 5.5%, but fell back to 1.3% in the third quarter. The BCC survey, which was conducted in the last week of November, indicated that the economy was on course to flatline in the fourth quarter. It was likely the economy would contract in the first months of this year as the message to work from home and avoid large gatherings affected sales, Thiru said. Thiru added: “The UK economy is starting 2022 facing some key challenges. The renewed reluctance among consumers to spend and staff shortages triggered by Omicron and plan B may mean that the UK economy contracts in the near term, particularly if more restrictions are needed. “Rising inflation is likely to limit UK’s growth prospects this year by eroding consumers’ spending power and squeezing firms’ profit margins and their ability to invest. The notable uptick in concerns over higher interest rates underscores the need for the Bank of England to proceed with caution on further rate rises to avoid undermining confidence and an already fragile recovery.” A separate survey by the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (Cips) found that 85% of the 228 firms questioned experienced supply chain disruption last year. A quarter of the firms said suppliers shutting down due to Covid restrictions caused them the most acute supply shortages. The majority (71%) of those experiencing disruption and shortages expected it to last for six months or more, while more than a third said shortages would persist into 2023. The Institute of Directors said its economic confidence index had tumbled from -6 in November to -17 this month, a sign of nervousness among business owners about the UK’s economic prospects. It said three-quarters of company directors expected costs to rise in the next 12 months, and most said they would raise prices to either fully or partially offset the rise in costs. A snapshot of the UK’s manufacturing sector in December showed supply chain disruption and staff shortages continued to hold back growth. The IHS Markit/Cips survey showed growth in UK factory output was limited last month by Covid restrictions and Brexit weighing on orders and pushing up costs. Inflows of new work from overseas dropped for the fourth month in a row. The BCC director general, Shevaun Haviland, said: “Supply chain disruption is continuing to persist, inflation is soaring, and rising energy costs are presenting firms with a huge headache. “With companies now having to grapple with the impact of Omicron and further changes to the rules on imports and exports of goods to the EU, there are significant hurdles for businesses in the months ahead.”;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/britains-stalling-economy-blamed-on-inflation-and-product-shortages;guardian;Business & Economy;;5348

In an interview with the editor and author Sam Baker for The Shift, which explores the challenges in life for women over the age of 40, Scotland’s first minister admitted her own ambivalence about discussing the subject in public. She said: “We talk about the menopause much more, and I’m very conscious of being a woman with a profile and a platform, a fair degree of influence, so I feel a responsibility – given that I’m at that age – to talk about it myself. “And yet even talking about it like this, I am so far out of my comfort zone, in terms of the intensely personal nature of it. That tells me no matter how far we’ve come in this discussion, we still have a long way to go that somebody like me still feels kind of uncomfortable with it.” Sturgeon, who is 51, described herself as “still in the foothills” of the menopause, adding: “Even though there is more information available than there has ever been before, there’s still a massive amount of guesswork about it. We’re still all feeling our way through it.” She told Baker that she had already had a conversation with her doctor about taking hormone replacement therapy, noting that her generation grew up reading – now discredited – scare stories about the treatment and asking: “How many women just suffered in silence and suffered unnecessarily because of that?”
Asked how she might deal with a hot flush during a work meeting, she said: “I would like to think I would be open about it. If you look around the world, there’s not been that many women leaders … I guess Angela Merkel must have gone through when she was in office, Hillary Clinton … so if you’ve got that platform, then I would like to think I would use that positively, but I’m also a human being.” Sturgeon said that while she had not yet experienced those symptoms, she was “definitely at the stage of feeling hotter overnight, not being able to sleep and all that sort of thing”. She added: “So I’ve got windows open in the depth of winter, my poor husband is shivering. I’ve thought to myself: what if that happens when I’m on my feet in parliament in the middle of first minister’s questions? What would I do? That could happen any time. I’m not sure I will know the answer to that question until it happens.” She joked: “Maybe male opposition leaders should be thinking about what I will do, as well.” Last summer, the Scottish government published its first women’s health plan, which included commitments to reduce waiting times for diagnosing endometriosis from more than eight years to less than 12 months, to offer individual care plans after a woman’s first miscarriage, and to widen access to specialist menopause services.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/25/i-feel-a-responsibility-to-talk-about-menopause-says-nicola-sturgeon;guardian;Politics;;1357

Although perhaps not anatomically correct, the crimson fibreglass structure is a faithful representation of a ceramic vessel from Peru’s pre-Columbian Mochica culture, whose people lived in the region between 150 and 700 AD. A 15-minute drive from the centre of the regional capital, Trujillo, the statue has already proved hugely popular with passers-by and tourists who pose beneath the 1.5-meter member for selfies. But despite its historical fidelity, the 9ft-tall fertility symbol has already been attacked by vandals who smashed a hole in the statue and reportedly fired shots in the air as they fled. Arturo Fernández Bazán, the mayor of Moche, the district named after the ancient culture, told local media: “At two in the morning three hooded criminals held a knife to the security guard’s neck to keep him from reacting or calling his colleagues on the radio, and two of them damaged the phallus.” The roadside monument to the ancient pre-Inca culture renowned for its sexually explicit ceramics has also drawn tourists, as the statue stands on the route between the imposing adobe temples of the sun and the moon, or the Huacas del Sol y la Luna. Fernández Bazán said he plans to erect up to 30 more statues representing the Mochica culture – about a third of them representing erotic acts or childbirth – along the archaeological circuit.
“In our Mochica culture, these types of ceramics vessels were not considered erotic but represented the Godhead,” Fernández Bazán, who worked as a gynaecologist before entering local politics, told local media.
“The [Ancient] Greeks had another type of representation. We have been more aggressive and more direct with our feelings,” he added. The statue has provoked diverse reactions posted on the Moche municipality Facebook page, some saying that they found the statue offensive or that it should not be viewed by children. Gisela Ortiz, Peru’s culture minister, said: “The idea that children shouldn’t see it or it’s too offensive belongs to the time of obscurantism.” She told the Guardian. “As Peruvians, we should all feel proud of our diverse heritage, including the sexual or erotic part, which is inherent to the human being.” She added that while “nothing justifies the violence against the security guard”, greater efforts to explain the cultural significance of the statue to the local population could help avert further controversy.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/peru-statue-penis-phallic-symbol-tourists;guardian;Politics;;5078

17;17;19;6060;6060;‘Extreme marine heatwave’: waters off Sydney set to break January temperature records;2022-01-04T16:30:18Z;['Graham Readfearn'];['Sydney', 'New South Wales', 'Environment', 'Climate crisis', 'Marine life', 'Australia news'];;"Waters off Sydney are undergoing an extreme marine heatwave with temperatures likely at their highest levels on record for January. Satellite data is showing the ocean surface off the coast of Sydney at 3C above normal, with swimmers and surfers reporting conditions that feel more like February and March than early January. Prof Moninya Roughan, an oceanographer at the University of New South Wales and an expert in marine heatwaves, said the hottest water was covering an area of about 200sq km.
Roughan is waiting until new data becomes available in the coming weeks from a long-term ocean temperature monitoring station at Port Hacking, where temperatures have been observed since the 1950s. But she said: “It appears now to be reaching those record levels and will likely be the hottest January on record. It’s an extreme marine heatwave.” She said there were three factors behind the extra heat. Global heating was pushing up background temperatures in the ocean, a La Nina weather system was helping transport warmer waters south, and atmospheric conditions were also playing a role. “Marine heatwaves are having severe consequences on ecosystems and they can kill habitats,” she said.
She said the warm belt of water off Sydney was still attached to the East Australian Current – the 100km-wide belt that runs south from the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland to the area off Sydney. She expected a large eddy would break off from the tip of the current and take warmer waters south of Sydney. “I expect that water will hang around and push south over the coming months,” she said.

Prof Rob Harcourt, a marine ecologist at Macquarie University in Sydney, regularly surfs off Sydney beaches. “It’s been over 21C in the water for over a month now. Everyone that surfs has been talking for weeks about how it’s felt more like February and March than December [when the heat started to build].” He said the warmer water was likely bringing bull and tiger sharks into the area and also farther south. Other species would also likely be arriving on the warmer waters.
Harcourt said while some species may benefit from warming oceans, the change in ocean temperatures along the eastern coast of Australia was dramatic. “A lot of animals will do poorly. A lot of animals that live in cooler waters, like seals and sharks, have a habitat that’s shrinking fast and the implications are hard to measure, but it’s likely to be dramatic.” He said in recent weeks whale sharks had been spotted north of Sydney and tiger and great white sharks had been seen feeding off a sperm whale carcass on the state’s far south coast. “Whale sharks do come down the coast but they’re rare,” he said.
He said warm water arriving on the current was nothing new, but this arrival was particularly early and was unusually warm. Research in the journal Nature has found marine heatwaves around the globe are becoming more frequent and are lasting longer. Separate research suggests the southern points of the East Australian Current are also warming faster than the area farther north.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/extreme-marine-heatwave-waters-off-sydney-set-to-break-january-temperature-records;guardian;Environment;;5612
18;18;20;2586;2586;Boris Johnson’s history is catching up with him, says Welsh first minister;2022-01-21T17:41:47Z;['Steven Morris'];['Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Mark Drakeford', 'Politics', 'Welsh politics', 'UK news', 'Wales', 'England'];;"The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has launched a fierce attack on Boris Johnson, claiming “his history is catching up with him” and suggesting the easing of Covid restrictions in England is designed to distract attention from the crisis the prime minister is facing. In sustained criticism of Johnson, Drakeford highlighted that Johnson had twice been sacked from previous jobs for lying and said he believed that everything the Conservative UK government was currently doing was about protecting his position.
Speaking at a press conference in Cardiff, Drakeford, who leads a Labour administration, said: “The prime minister is someone who’s been sacked from two previous jobs for not telling the truth.” He flagged up a newspaper editorial on the eve of the December 2019 election that spelled out Johnson’s flaws, adding: “In many ways, I think what you see is his history catching up with him.” It is believed he was referring to a Sunday Times editorial that said Johnson had an “on-off relationship with the truth” and often preferred “bluster to grasp of detail”. In 2004 Johnson was fired by the then Tory leader, Michael Howard, from positions as shadow arts minister and party vice-chair for lying about an extramarital affair. In the late 1980s, Johnson was sacked by the Times over a front-page article in which he allegedly invented a quote. Drakeford claimed the decision this week to lift coronavirus restrictions in England was about distracting the public’s attention from the scandal engulfing Johnson. “Everything that goes on in Whitehall and Westminster at the moment for the UK government is seen exclusively through the lens of: how does this make a difference to the efforts that are being made to shore up the position of the prime minister? “This is a government that at the moment is simply not capable of doing the ordinary business of government in a competent and sensible way because it is overwhelmed by the headlines that surround dreadful events that went on in Downing Street.” Drakeford said Wales had passed the peak of the Omicron storm and more restrictions such as limits on sporting events have been lifted. The country is due to return to alert level 0 – under which more restrictions are eased – on 28 January as long as the situation continues to improve. The first minister’s attack on Johnson was in turn strongly criticised by the Tories, who accused him of playing politics and trying to distract people from the ongoing restrictions in Wales. The Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said: “These are completely unnecessary and inappropriate comments by the first minister and is further proof that it’s always been about the politics, and not the science, for his Labour administration. “They are a straightforward deflection tactic from a government that has punished Welsh families and businesses with the harshest restrictions in the UK throughout the pandemic.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/21/boris-johnson-history-catching-up-welsh-first-minister-drakeford;guardian;Politics;;2137
19;19;21;554;554;Norma Waterson obituary;2022-01-31T13:55:03Z;['Robin Denselow'];['Music', 'Culture', 'Folk music', 'Jazz', 'Mercury prize', 'Awards and prizes', 'Norma Waterson', 'Eliza Carthy'];;"Norma Waterson, who has died aged 82, was one of the finest and most versatile singers of the British folk revival. She spent most of her life singing traditional songs, many from her native east Yorkshire, in two highly successful groups, the Watersons and Waterson:Carthy, in which she was joined by other members of her family. But her no-nonsense, soulful and unashamedly emotional approach was well-suited to a wide variety of other musical styles, as she displayed in the solo recordings and collaborations with Eliza Carthy, her daughter, that won her a following far beyond the folk scene. She was a hard-working, prolific artist who refused to stop recording or touring, and was singing as well in her 70s as she had in her 20s. Her final album, Anchor (2018), was the second that she had recorded with Eliza, and was a typically varied and experimental affair. It included Norma singing lead on a dramatic, jazz-edged treatment of the Tom Waits song Strange Weather and on a gently powerful version of Nick Lowe’s The Beast in Me. The duo’s award-winning debut album, Gift (2010), was followed by a tour, during which Norma fell seriously ill, suffering from heart problems. She recovered, and returned to her home in Robin Hood’s Bay, on the Yorkshire coast, cared for by her husband, the singer and guitarist Martin Carthy, and Eliza. Although she found it hard to travel, she wanted to continue singing, and performed at the local annual festival, Normafest, set up in her honour. Her last such appearance was in January 2018.
Norma was brought up in the port of Hull, Yorkshire, by her maternal grandmother, Eliza Ward, partly of Irish Gypsy descent, who ran a second-hand shop during the second world war. Norma’s parents, Florence and Charles, died when she was very young and she spent much of her childhood looking after her younger brother Mike and sister Elaine, better known as Lal. It was a time, Norma said, when “most people had a piano in the parlour. We didn’t have a telly but my grandma knew all the music hall songs and we listened to pop music on Radio Luxembourg”. The children sang together around the house, and formed a group, the Mariners, during the trad jazz and skiffle era of the 1950s. From American folk, they became increasingly interested in the English tradition. They started a folk club in a Hull pub, the Blue Bell, and changed their name to the Watersons. The group consisted of Norma, Mike and Lal, and their second cousin John Harrison, and they transformed the 60s folk revival in Britain partly because they dressed like any other fashion-conscious young musicians of the time (they were nicknamed the “folk Beatles”), but mostly because of their attacking, unaccompanied harmony treatment of ancient English songs. As Mike commented at the time “we’re earthy, like the Rolling Stones”. He and Norma handled most of the lead vocals, with Lal providing often highly adventurous harmonies – this was a group that followed no traditional rules. As Norma explained: “If you couldn’t find a note, you sang a harmony.” The Watersons’ first album, Frost and Fire (1965), was followed by The Watersons and A Yorkshire Garland. The group were widely praised but split up in 1968, exhausted from touring.
Norma’s first marriage (in 1958), to Eddie Anderson, had also ended, and now she spent time away from her brother and sister, moving to Montserrat in the West Indies, where she worked as a DJ. When she returned in 1972, she married Carthy, who joined the reformed Watersons, taking the place of Harrison. The new line-up recorded three albums, For Pence and Spicy Ale (1975), Sound, Sound Your Instruments of Joy (1977) and Green Fields (1981). In 1977 Norma also recorded the album A True Hearted Girl with Lal. In 1976, all three siblings and their families moved to Kirk Moor, a group of isolated farming cottages on the edge of the North York Moors. It is an exquisite, remote location, reached down a narrow lane that can be snowbound in winter, and was known to local villagers as “the hippy commune”. The arrangement ended in the late 80s when Norma and Lal and their families moved to Robin Hood’s Bay. Lal left the Watersons in 1990, but Norma kept working in a new group, Waterson:Carthy, in which she was joined by her husband and daughter. This group differed from the Watersons because it made use of instrumental backing, with Martin Carthy demonstrating his celebrated guitar work and Eliza playing the fiddle. Waterson:Carthy recorded six albums, first as a trio (on Waterson:Carthy, 1994 and Common Tongue, 1997), then with Saul Rose joining them on melodeon (Broken Ground, 1999), and later with Tim van Eyken taking his place (A Dark Light, 2002, Fishes and Fine Yellow Sand, 2004 and Holy Heathens and the Old Green Man, 2006). They concentrated on English traditional songs, but also included material from the Bahamas, the US, or a song by Mike. Norma was also part of the occasional folk harmony “super-group” Blue Murder. On their 2002 album, No One Stands Alone, she was joined by Martin and Eliza, Mike and the vocal trio Barry Coope, Jim Boyes and Lester Simpson, for a set that included a rousing treatment of Mike’s Rubber Band.
Norma was one of the finest exponents of English traditional songs, but displayed her love of other styles in her eclectic and soulful solo albums. Norma Waterson (1996) included songs by Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter of the Grateful Dead, Elvis Costello, Richard Thompson and Lal, as well as the self-composed Hard Times Heart. The album was nominated for a Mercury prize, an award usually associated with pop and rock rather than folk, and very nearly won – the prize went instead to Pulp’s Different Class. Three years later, she expanded her range with The Very Thought of You, which included an emotional (but never sentimental) reworking of Over the Rainbow, and Love of My Life, by Freddie Mercury – along with the first recording of Lal’s angry Reply to Joe Haines, written after Harold Wilson’s former press secretary had written what Lal thought to be a deeply offensive article about Mercury’s death from Aids. In 2000, Norma recorded her first solo album of traditional songs, Bright Shiny Morning. With the album Gift, and the subsequent tour, she brought all these different musical influences together. She had suffered from a series of health problems, and had difficulty in walking, but was still in magnificent voice and handled the majority of the solos during the tour. At the BBC folk awards in 2011, Gift was named album of the year, and the song Poor Wayfaring Stranger, taken from the album, best traditional track. In 2016 she received a BBC folk awards lifetime achievement award. She was made MBE in 2002. Her last London concert, at which she appeared alongside Eliza at the Union Chapel, in 2010, was recorded and released as The Gift Band – Live on Tour album. It provided a triumphant and suitably emotional summary of her career. She told her audience that “it’s hard to stick to just one kind of music”, before joining her daughter for a set that included folk songs, contemporary songs by Thompson, the slow and emotional Dreaming, written for her by Loudon Wainwright, along with the gloriously tuneful Bunch of Thyme, a song about mortality, and songs she had learned in her childhood. Between songs, she chatted to the audience in the same easy-going and humorous way that she chatted to those who visited her home. Lal died in 1998; and Mike in 2011. Norma is survived by Martin and Eliza; and by Tim, her son from her first marriage. • Norma Christine Waterson, singer, born 15 August 1939; died 30 January 2022";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/31/norma-waterson-obituary;guardian;Entertainment & Culture;;103
20;20;22;782;782;Out with Towie as Essex tries to shed its brash image;2022-01-30T10:00:17Z;['Tim Burrows'];['Essex', 'Gentrification', 'The Only Way is Essex', 'UK news', 'Society'];;"What is it with Essex and makeovers? It was reported that the county council is to invest more than £300,000 to put its best face on and “challenge people’s preconceived ideas of how they see Essex on TV”. Council bosses wanted to banish thoughts of The Only Way Is Essex, fake tan and fast cars synonymous with the south of the county, replacing them with the Constable-country vistas, windmills and nice thatched cottages of north Essex. We’ve been here before. The council’s drive to combat the Essex stereotype is almost as old as the stereotype itself. In 1997, moves to improve the county’s image were reported in the national press. “Difficulties arise when overseas investors come to the UK, go to competitor locations, and hear jokes about Essex girls having more shoes than books,” said the head of the Essex Economic Partnership, Terry Conder. The council said it often received letters from residents about Essex’s reputation. As the new millennium arrived, Essex asked the government for permission to spend council tax payers’ money on improving its image and the council started its “Real Essex” tourism campaign. It spent £100,000 on a drive that claimed Essex was, borrowing from the old Mars bar adverts, the place to “work, play and rest”. Like today, they wanted to draw attention to Constable and quaint villages.
As with most disquieting elements of British discourse, Essex’s reputation was partly a creation of the rightwing press. Essex man was invented in 1990 via an anonymously published Sunday Telegraph editorial by Simon Heffer. The High Tory columnist grew up watching a new town, South Woodham Ferrers, being built on the edge of marshland downhill from his village. It soon filled up with Cockney emigres. West Ham United usurped the local passion for cricket. After a chance encounter with a loutish, Essex-based City worker on a train into Liverpool Street, he exacted revenge through a gross caricature depicting vomiting at the station. Heffer and other Conservatives didn’t hate Essex man, however. After all, he was the future of the party, and typified the age of upward mobility. His invention was useful for the Tories as it claimed working-class social mobility exclusively for Thatcherism, rather than it being part of a longer process you could trace back to the rise of Keir Hardie and Labour in metropolitan Essex in the late 19th century. The editorial freely admitted, too, that Essex was more an ideal than a location bound by geography: “For spiritual purposes, Essex is to be found all over the newly affluent parts of the outer London suburbs.” Essex man’s less industrious and more materialistic counterpart, Essex girl, soon formed part of the repertoire, rubber-stamped when the Ilford-born Sun journalist Richard Littlejohn ghost-wrote a grim little tome of misogynistic jokes, largely about the promiscuity of women half his age. The power of the Essex girl gave journalists the licence to pry into the sex lives of very young, even underage, girls.
So, does the council have a point? Essex, after all, was the fifth least popular English county, according to a YouGov poll in 2018. Kent, our neighbour just over the estuary from where I live in Southend, is frequently near the top of most-visited lists, Essex languishes nearer the bottom. Yet, in making this all about image, the council is ignoring other factors. Essex is still agricultural and, despite the excellent walks along its many public footpaths, much of its countryside is earmarked for private use. Thanks to its proximity to London, much of south Essex is either residential land or green belt. People still flock to Southend and Clacton on bank holidays but, more than tourism, Essex is a success story about the idea of making a home, from the postwar plotland dreamers building in former farmers’ fields to the influx of Eastenders to new towns such as Harlow and Basildon. Essex was inundated by the North Sea flood of 1953, with scores of casualties, and today great concrete sea walls keep the tide at bay in places such as Canvey Island. It is as if the council is following suit, building bigger and bigger defences to keep out the tide of representations. In truth, the stereotype is being eroded by the passage of time. The term Essex girl was taken out of the Oxford Dictionary in 2020. Essex man, so characterised by his daily commute to the City, has had to diversify into home working since the pandemic started. There is no “Real Essex” to be unearthed if we can just crack through the veneer of the mediated, overdone, “fake” Essex of TV lore. Because – and can I just shock you – I have seen Botox fillers in Constable country, too. The Invention Of Essex by Tim Burrows will be published by Profile Books in 2023";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/30/out-with-towie-as-essex-tries-to-shed-its-brash-image;guardian;Politics;;331
21;21;24;1163;1163;Getting Curious With Jonathan Van Ness review – the most zany teacher you could wish for;2022-01-28T11:00:04Z;['Rebecca Nicholson'];['Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture'];;"What is television? After watching Getting Curious With Jonathan Van Ness (Netflix), I don’t think I know any more. This series is a spin-off from the Queer Eye star’s podcast of the same name, in which Van Ness quite literally gets curious about a topic, then speaks to various guests about it. The podcast is long-running, well-established and very charming, but the question of whether it needed to become a more visual experience is yet to be answered. Van Ness is clearly a star. The former hairdresser made their name with the extremely funny Gay of Thrones online recaps, and went on to become part of the new Fab Five on the updated, much improved Queer Eye makeover series, which is always good for a cathartic cry and a renewed sense of faith in humanity. Van Ness is the one participants often open up to, usually while having their hair spritzed. Amiable, warm and an impressive interviewer, they give the impression of someone who genuinely wants to listen and learn. They are also excitable. All of this sets them up well to host an all-sorts, magazine show. The first episode, Are Bugs Gorgeous or Gross? (we’ve all wondered), makes it seem as if the whole thing will play out like a high camp, low-budget take on The Green Planet. It sees Van Ness speak to a range of experts and entomologists about the importance of insects; if you can maintain a sturdy stomach while watching a termite queen do her thing you have more resilience than me. “That’s really cool,” coos Van Ness, though I’m not sure I believe them. It’s a high-octane mix of facts, footage and parody. Van Ness regularly pops up dressed as an angel or a devil, to declare that a bug is “Gorgeous!” or “Gross!” At one point, Drag Race star Monét X Change appears to co-host a spoof red carpet event, shouting about the “realness” of the bugs who are walking it. It is busy and discombobulating, but finds its voice pretty quickly. For all the fun snippets about insects and Van Ness’s willingness to get stuck in (they actually do get stuck in, when a chef serves them insects), it eventually swerves into a more nuanced zone – if you can call a choreographed dance routine about the cultural history of hairstyles featuring Angela Davis and Elizabeth I nuanced. The rest of the episodes are more suited to Van Ness’s open-hearted and zany approach to learning, with frank discussions on, officially, hair, snacks, the gender binary, skyscrapers and figure-skating. Below the surface, though, these end up as empathic explorations of identity. The episode about gender – Van Ness identifies as non-binary – features that rare thing, an onscreen discussion about non-binary people, between non-binary people, that is not adversarial. “Literally can’t talk,” Van Ness manages to say, clearly moved by the experience. There is much to recommend. Academics with unusual specialisms are great value on television, and seeing people’s unbridled dedication to wigs or spiders or 18th-century paintings is always entertaining. Van Ness is a delight to watch, so easy in conversation with strangers, and their wide-eyed enthusiasm is infectious. Their conversation with the congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, about Pressley’s relationship with her hair as a Black woman, and her experiences with alopecia, is unusually intimate for an interview with a politician. Perhaps a guest spot on Newsnight would not be a terrible idea. What’s curious, though, is that as a podcast, this format is fantastic, and if Van Ness released this show on YouTube, I would fully accept its giddy, scattergun energy. I watch Netflix on the same browser, and the same screen, but something about it here feels like a less easy fit. Does that mean this is television or not? I still don’t know. Maybe Van Ness can answer that one in another series.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/28/getting-curious-with-jonathan-van-ness-review-the-most-zany-teacher-you-could-wish-for;guardian;Entertainment & Culture;;712
22;22;25;849;849;Hillsong founder Brian Houston steps down as leader of church;2022-01-30T04:11:06Z;['Mostafa Rachwani'];['Hillsong Church', 'Religion', 'Australia news', 'Christianity'];;"Hillsong founder Brian Houston has announced he is stepping down as leader of the church as he defends criminal charges that allege he covered up his father’s child sexual abuse. In a statement made on Sunday, Houston said he made the decision after consulting with the church’s leadership and legal counsel. “The Hillsong Global Board feel it is in my and the church’s best interest for this to happen, so I have agreed to step aside from all ministry responsibilities until the end of the year. “The court case I am facing is related to circumstances surrounding my father, and I need to be fully committed to preparation and engagement with the case and work closely with my lawyers in defending this charge. “I have said, including in a prior statement, that I intend to fight the charge and welcome the opportunity to set the record straight.”
Houston was charged last October with one count of concealing the serious indictable offence of another person. He had initially stepped aside as Hillsong’s board chairman after being charged. In the statement, the pastor said the charges came as a “shock” to him, and he intends to “vigorously defend” himself. He said his decision to step down was also driven by his emotional wellbeing. “We have talked about the effects of the situation with my father, which go back many years up to the current legal case, and the impact this has had on me emotionally.” Houston’s father, Frank, died in 2004, and has been accused of the alleged abuse of a young man in the 1970s. His son is due in court in Sydney in October, and said his latest decision came after discussions with the church’s board last December. “In December, during our board meeting, Hillsong’s external legal counsel gave the board advice regarding the current charge I am facing,” he said. “That it would be ‘best practice’ for me to step aside completely from church leadership during the court proceedings. “The court processes are likely to be drawn out and take up most of 2022 (especially considering the backlog in the courts, exacerbated by the Covid pandemic).”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/hillsong-founder-brian-houston-steps-down-as-leader-of-church;guardian;Entertainment & Culture;;398

24;24;27;4349;4349;It's baby boomers, not young people, who are more likely to be addicted to drugs | Tony Rao;2022-01-13T12:06:26Z;['Tony Rao'];['Drugs', 'Older people', 'Society', 'Alcohol', 'Alcoholism', 'Health', 'UK news'];;"When I joined a community mental health team for older people 20 years ago, addiction wasn’t a central part of our work. One of our first referrals was for an alcoholic patient threatened with eviction. It was rejected – it wasn’t relevant to our service, or so I thought. But over the years the referrals combining social problems and addiction kept coming. We would bat the problems back to the GP, yet the same patients would be referred years later for depression and dementia. Their issues hadn’t gone away; if anything, they had worsened. It was a salutary lesson that led me to join forces with a group of professionals and delve more deeply into the problem of drug and alcohol addiction in older people. As we dug into the data, a pattern began to emerge of substance misuse among those born between 1946 and 1964: the so-called “baby boomers”. Their higher rates of addiction than in older or younger generations are coming home to roost, with implications for public health and clinical services.
New analysis of NHS figures shows that the numbers of older people using addiction services have pulled away from other age groups at an alarming speed. Cannabis remains the most widely used illicit drug, with the number of people aged 55 and over under the care of drug treatment services rising by nearly 800% over the past 15 years – the figure for the over-65s is more than 1,000%. This compares to a drop of more than 25% among 18- to 19-year-olds. But it doesn’t stop there. For alcohol, opioids, cocaine, crack and amphetamines, there has been a drop of more than 25% in the number of 18- to 19-year-olds under addiction services, compared with a rise of more than 200% in the 55-and-over group over the same timeframe. There are many reasons for this trend. Baby boomers had considerably more exposure to alcohol advertising in their youth, socialising without a drink was looked upon askance and there was a more permissive attitude to “recreational” drug use, with little awareness of the potential harms of drugs such as cannabis. As they have grown older, this age group has also cut down on its drug and alcohol use less than previous generations. Indeed, some people may even have cut down previously, only to increase their use during retirement. And their problems may be masked. One of my female patients presented with recurrent falls until, after a year, she told me that she was drinking half a bottle of whiskey a day. A male patient of mine complained of constant tiredness and poor sleep until he told me that he smoked cannabis four times a week. In this context, it’s encouraging that the figures suggest more older people are seeking help. I have been making sense of data on drug and alcohol use in older people for years and putting it under the noses of policymakers. Some of these efforts have borne fruit. The £25m Big Lottery-funded Drink Wise Age Well project provided an evidence base for what can be done to prevent, protect and intervene so that the physical, psychological and social harms from alcohol can be mitigated among older people. However, drug addiction in older people is still flying under the radar. In 2019, a letter from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, drew attention to the needs of an ageing cohort of drug users. The council recommended that a “particular focus should be the availability and knowledge of staff to address the complex physical and mental health issues of older drug users”. Yet in the second part of Dame Carol Black’s Independent Review of Drugs older people were conspicuous by their absence. We ignore the startling trend in treatment for drug and alcohol addiction among older people at our peril. Older people not only have distinct problems that reflect the physical and psychosocial consequences of ageing, but are also at risk of distinct mental disorders such as alcohol-related dementia. Looking to the future, truly integrated care will mean joining together public health and the NHS to rebuild addiction services. That will come at a cost, but one that will undoubtedly improve the lives and livelihoods of our invisible addicts.

The Duke of Cambridge tried out a game during a visit to BAFTA's redeveloped London headquarters and said of his three children: ""At the moment it's trying to regulate the gaming... monitoring screen time. Got to be careful of that.

""They're fascinated by it. George particularly. He's more interested in it. The other two are a bit too small at the moment but they love the films. I adore film and gaming as well.""

The duke's concern over how much time his children spend in front of devices such as computers, TVs and tablets is shared by many parents.

One study last year suggested young children with high levels of screen time are at a higher risk of problems such as hyperactivity, poor concentration and friendship issues.

We were delighted to welcome The Duke of Cambridge to our newly refurbished HQ 195 Piccadilly today, to learn about BAFTA’s new initiatives improving access to careers in film, games and TV 🎞🕹📺 pic.twitter.com/xYmAXrLMKY — BAFTA (@BAFTA) January 27, 2022

William was visiting BAFTA to launch a bursary scheme in his name to ""supercharge"" the careers of talented people from under-represented groups who want to build a career in gaming, film and television.

The prince met several young creatives including Harry Petch, 20, who showed off his carbon capture game Net Carbon, and also chatted to Doctor Foster actress Suranne Jones - who helps up and coming talent for BAFTA.

William is the president of the organisation, which is best known for its annual film awards but is increasing its mentoring support for under-represented groups.

""I am hugely proud of BAFTA's ongoing commitment to ensuring that young talent from all walks of life are given every possible opportunity to build and develop successful careers in the film, games and television industries,"" said the prince in a statement.

""The redevelopment of 195 Piccadilly has created fantastic new learning spaces to ensure that future generations can receive the support they need to thrive.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220128000355/https://news.sky.com/story/prince-william-monitoring-childrens-screen-time-as-he-reveals-georges-love-of-gaming-12526931;skynews;Entertainment & Culture;;1874

27;27;30;4471;4471;The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s apologetic defence: so begins an era of political chaos | Editorial;2022-01-12T19:07:23Z;['Editorial'];['Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Coronavirus', 'Health policy', 'PMQs', 'Health', 'House of Commons', 'Politics', 'Gray report'];;Once again the country finds itself paralysed by a crisis in the Conservative party. Tory MPs took a gamble on Boris Johnson’s personality in order to gain the benefit of his Brexit credentials. In 2019, Mr Johnson did lead his party to victory in the general election. But that bet has not paid off subsequently because of who he is: an incompetent rogue, disloyal to almost everyone but himself. His government has stumbled from crisis to crisis in recent months, wrecking its authority. Mr Johnson deals with scandals by hunkering down and waiting for the storm to blow itself out. That is the approach he adopted on Wednesday. After weeks of dodging questions, Mr Johnson offered an apology – and a defence – for spending 25 minutes at a boozy evening event in May 2020 for dozens of people in the Downing Street garden in breach of the law during the first Covid lockdown. However, the Tory leader used lawyerly phrasing to imply that he had, at the time, considered this to be work. This was not a plausible rebuttal, and will not wash with the public. Voters will surely only think that Mr Johnson was at an illegal No 10 garden party when their loved ones were dying alone in hospitals. The lockdown regulations were in place to protect the public and squash the spread of the virus in an unvaccinated population. There could not have been one rule for the public and another for the prime minister. However, voters have no immediate opportunity to evict Mr Johnson from Downing Street. If the prime minister’s apology is genuine, he should accept he broke the law. He almost certainly lied to parliament and deceived voters for weeks. There has to be a price. Labour and the Lib Dems have called for him to go. Mr Johnson is not someone given to resigning. The police could issue a fine. That would be a resigning matter for a prime minister. If Mr Johnson were secure in his job he might shrug it off. But he isn’t. Instead, the prime minister sought shelter behind the investigation by Sue Gray, a senior Cabinet Office official. This is perhaps because Ms Gray is unlikely to rule on Mr Johnson’s defence – that he “thought” the people drinking in No 10’s garden were at a work event. It is more likely that Ms Gray resigns because she thought Mr Johnson was not taking her inquiry seriously than the prime minister departs because of its findings. Mr Johnson can be turfed out of office by Tory MPs – and it is they who need an acceptable explanation for May 2020 to appease angry voters. The odds that Conservative backbenchers change their leader shorten as those of their re-election lengthen. While 15% of the parliamentary party could trigger a no-confidence vote in Mr Johnson, he will be safe – for 12 months – if he has 180 MPs backing him. Many are in open revolt. A few hours after his statement, Douglas Ross, leader of Scottish Conservatives, called for Mr Johnson to resign. A senior backbencher, William Wragg, followed suit. The irony is that Mr Johnson was elected to put an end to an era of political chaos that began with the 2016 referendum on EU membership. However, his shortcomings have ensured Tory rebellions will become part of political life. Factions now vie for party supremacy against a backdrop of post-pandemic rows over net zero and Brexit. Mr Johnson no doubt hopes to fight May’s local elections as Tory leader. But it is now clear that the prime minister grievously betrayed the trust of the nation at a time of national crisis. If he stays in Downing Street, it will only intensify the divisions in Britain over how to run the economy and manage the country.;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/12/the-guardian-view-of-boris-johnsons-apologetic-defence-so-begins-an-era-of-political-chaos;guardian;Politics;;4023
