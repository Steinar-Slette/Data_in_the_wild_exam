The deaths happened at about 9pm on Wednesday in a beach area called New Kru Town in the country's capital, Monrovia.

A pregnant woman was reportedly among those killed.

""The doctors said 29 persons died and some are on the critical list,"" deputy information minister Jalawah Tonpo told state radio.

He called it a ""sad day for the country"".

A witness said the stampede happened when armed men rushed the crowd in a robbery attempt.

""We saw a group of men with cutlasses and other weapons coming toward the crowd,"" Exodus Morias said.

""While running, some people dropped and others fell on the ground and walked over them.""

Hundreds had been at the event and police spokesman Moses Carter said one person had been arrested.

Rev Abraham Kromah, who was putting on the event and has a church in the city, was also questioned.

The victims' bodies were taken to a morgue at the nearby Redemption Hospital.

President George Weah declared three days of national mourning and visited some of the survivors at the hospital on Thursday.

His office said the Liberian Red Cross and Disaster Management Agency had been called in to help.

Girl With Balloon, Kissing Coppers and Vandalised Oils (Choppers) will go under the hammer at Sotheby's in London on 2 March.

The former Take That star said the paintings were some of the street artist's best work.

""I remember seeing Girl With Balloon, Vandalised Oils (Choppers) and Kissing Coppers for the first time,"" he said.

""I believe they are some of his best paintings and I love how closely linked they are to the street pieces. As a collector of Banksy's work, you become part of a broader cultural movement.""

The classic pop-art image of Girl With Balloon first appeared under Waterloo Bridge in 2002. A version of it made headlines in 2018 after it was partially shredded at the end of a Sotheby's auction.

Williams' version is on metal and will have a starting price of £2m.

Kissing Coppers, which depicts two police officers in a passionate embrace, made its debut on the exterior of the Prince Albert Pub in Brighton in 2004.

The original mural was removed after being repeatedly vandalised.

Williams' version from 2005, estimated at £2.5m to £3.5m, will be the first Kissing Coppers painting on canvas to be auctioned, Sotheby's said.

The third painting, Vandalised Oils (Choppers), features military helicopters disrupting a calm rural landscape and is part of a series of graffitied oil paintings.

Like Kissing Coppers, the piece is valued at £2.5m to £3.5m.

""These works unite the cultural legacies of two of Britain's biggest stars: Robbie Williams and Banksy,"" said Hugo Cobb, head of the Sotheby's event.

He said the paintings are ""acerbic, iconic, irreverent and unique"", like their creator and owner.

The report, compiled by a German law firm, found that the pope - then called Josef Ratzinger - could be ""accused of misconduct"" over his handling of the cases.

Ratzinger, 93, has lived in the Vatican since the end of his papacy in 2013, but he was archbishop of Munich and Freising between 1977 and 1982.

The report detailed four instances involving the archbishop:

• Two cases where perpetrators offended while he was in office but, while they were punished by the judicial system, they were allowed to continue pastoral work without limitations

• A case where a cleric convicted outside Germany was put into service in Munich despite Ratzinger knowing his history

• A suspected paedophile priest transferred to Munich for therapy in 1980 - a transfer approved by Ratzinger. The priest was allowed to resume pastoral work - a decision the church said was made by someone else - and was convicted of molesting a boy in 1986

The former pope has denied the accusations.

One of the report's authors Martin Pusch said: ""In a total of four cases, we came to the conclusion that the then-archbishop, Cardinal Ratzinger, can be accused of misconduct.""

Munich's current archbishop, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, has promised a response to the report later today.

Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said it would evaluate the full report and examine its details.

He said: ""In reiterating a sense of shame and remorse for the abuse of minors by clergy, the Holy See assures its closeness to all victims and confirms the path it has taken to protect the little ones and guarantee them a safe environment.""

A separate report in 2018, commissioned by the church, found that at least 3,677 people were abused by Germany's clergy between 1946 and 2014.

Murray was defeated in the second round of the tournament, by the lowest-ranked player he has ever lost to at a grand slam.

Taro Daniel, ranked 120th in the world, beat the tennis star in straight sets to go through to the third round.

""I'm really, really disappointed,"" said Murray.

""Very frustrated. A tough loss for me that's for sure,"" he added.

The 34-year-old questioned whether he would be back at the Australian Open next year, saying he would like to be ""but not if I do what I did tonight too often this season.""

""This is a really important year for me for a number of reasons and I want to perform well in the big events.""

""Making second rounds of slams is not something I find particularly motivating. I want to be doing better than that. It depends on how I get on this year results wise and how I perform in the big events,"" he added.

The two-time Wimbledon champion had never lost to a player ranked outside the top 100 at a grand slam event before.

His 6-4 6-4 6-4 defeat to Daniel ended hopes he could repeat his former successes after being held back by injuries in recent years.

Murray received a warning for slamming his racket against the court, as his frustration seemed to take its toll during the match.

Raducanu out in injury drama

There were high hopes for Emma Raducanu when she arrived in Melbourne after her historic victory at the US Open last year.

But, the 19-year-old's Australian Open debut ended in a painful defeat when she was forced into a medical time-out after five games.

The teenager seemed to be struggling with blisters on her right hand, wincing in pain at times during her match against Montenegrin Danka Kovinic.

Despite the pain she was in, she took a set off her opponent - ranked 98 in the world - in the end losing 4-6 6-4 3-6.

Raducanu said: ""I thought it was a pretty good learning experience for me. I can take some positives even from this match.

""I was struggling with my hand before the match. There were some people in my team that maybe didn't want me to play, but I wanted to go out there and fight through it.""

The teenager's defeat was the first time she has lost a completed match at a grand slam, having got through the US Open in September without losing a set and pulling out of Wimbledon with breathing difficulties in July last year.

British men's number two Dan Evans was given a free passage through to the third round of the men's singles when his opponent withdrew.

He was due to take on Arthur Rinderknech, but reached the last 32 automatically when his French opponent suffered a wrist injury.

He will play again on Saturday.

Meanwhile, British women's number two Heather Watson was defeated in a tight match against Slovenian Tamara Zidansek.

The extremist, who has already served 10 years of a maximum 21 year jail sentence, was described as still a ""very dangerous man"" on the third and final day of his parole hearing in Skien.

The prison term can be extended indefinitely if he is deemed a continued threat to society.

Prosecutor Hulda Karlsdottir said the mass killer, now aged 42, had ""not shown any genuine remorse in court"" and that his behaviour was part of a PR stunt.

'Parole should not be granted'

Image: Prosecutors say his parole request should not be granted

""In the clear view of the prosecution, Breivik's request for parole should not be granted,"" she said in closing arguments.

On the hearing's first day, Breivik professed white supremacist views and made Nazi salutes while he claimed to be reformed.

Proceedings have taken place in a prison gymnasium which was converted into a makeshift courtroom.

A psychiatrist, who has observed him since 2012, told the court that Breivik cannot be trusted.

'Imminent danger'

And a prison official also said there was an ""imminent danger"" of him committing further serious violent crimes if released.

The Norwegian extremist was convicted in 2011 after setting off a bomb in Oslo's government district and then carrying out a shooting spree at a summer camp for left-wing youth activists on Utoya island.

At his trial, Breivik was declared criminally sane, despite the prosecution's claims that he was psychotic.

He did not appeal his 21 year sentence, but he unsuccessfully sued the government for human rights violations for denying him the right to communicate with sympathisers.

Although Breivik is serving Norway's maximum sentence, he is under the provision of being kept in prison for as long as he is deemed a menace to society.

The court is expected to rule on his parole request later this month.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120153149/https://news.sky.com/story/anders-breivik-norwegian-terrorist-still-very-dangerous-after-10-years-in-jail-and-should-not-be-released-on-parole-court-told-12520924;'ARTICLE-4: politics'

6;6;1373;1373;Climate change: Shell carbon capture facility 'secures just 48% of hydrogen production emissions';Thursday 20 January 2022 17:36, UK;['helen-ann smith', '@helenannsmith0'];['climate crisis'];['technology', 'blue', 'carbon', 'change', 'emissions', 'project', 'climate', 'hydrogen', 'capture', 'secures', 'facility', 'energy', 'production', 'shell'];"One of the only facilities in the world that uses carbon capture and storage technology to reduce the emissions of hydrogen production has the same carbon footprint as 1.2 million petrol cars, according to a new report seen exclusively by Sky News.

In a first-of-its-kind investigation into the plant, which is owned and operated by Shell, the lobby group Global Witness claims that it has emitted far more greenhouse gas than it has captured.

While it has prevented five million tons of carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere since 2015, it has released a further 7.5 million tons, the group said.

Using carbon capture and storage (CCS) alongside hydrogen production is known as 'blue hydrogen' and has been much championed by governments and the energy industry alike as vital to the green transition.

Image: Shell has dismissed the claims made by Global Witness, saying its analysis is 'simply wrong'

Although Shell publishes its broader emissions annually and reports these site specific emissions in technical reports to Canadian authorities, they have not been included in any public-focused communications, which report authors say amounts to Shell ""not telling us the full story.""

The plant in question is located in Alberta, Canada and is part of Shell's Scotford refinery, where hydrogen is produced for use in refining bitumen - a type of oil sands.

'Quest', the CCS facility, was added in 2015 as part of a project to test the capabilities of the new technology.

As Quest was, in effect, 'retrofitted' to an existing plant, it doesn't cover the emissions from the entire facility.

Experts say that more modern, 'purpose built', blue hydrogen facilities can capture over 90% of a plant's emissions.

The report found that this facility captures just 48% of its on-site carbon dioxide emissions.

Once you include other emissions, such as from the fossil gas supply chain, only 39% are captured.

Despite this, the plant has been subsidised by the Canadian government to the tune of $US654m.

""Shell says that its carbon capture system at this project in Canada is an effective tool for reducing carbon emissions.

""Our investigation found that's clearly not the case,"" said Dominic Eagleton, senior campaigner and report author at Global Witness.

""Carbon capture is definitely part of the problem. Because it has a history of failure, almost 80% of government funded large scale, carbon capture projects have failed over the years.

""Instead of investing in this dirty, climate-wrecking fuel, governments should promote and boost investment into renewable energy sources like wind power, solar power, that can take us to a genuinely more sustainable future and a safe climate for all.""

Hydrogen production has existed for many years, but it has become a popular fuel amid the push to net zero as it emits no greenhouse gasses at the point of consumption.

However, it is predominantly produced using fossil fuels in a process that emits greenhouse gas - this is dubbed 'grey hydrogen'.

While there are a few examples of it being produced using renewable energy ('green hydrogen'), at present this is much more expensive.

'Blue hydrogen' has therefore been touted as a good solution in the immediacy, as it is a cleaner technology that can be scaled quickly and comparatively cheaply.

There are only a handful of facilities globally that use CCS with hydrogen production and there are none which currently deploy the most modern 'gold standard' purpose-built technology.

This newer technology is being designed to capture emissions from all stages of the hydrogen production process and not just a section of it, as is seen at the moment. Experts say it could capture as much as 97%.

Shell itself is planning to build such a facility at the Scotford refinery in a project called 'Polaris'.

Some sections of the energy industry argue that it is this technology that should properly constitute the definition of blue hydrogen.

A Shell spokesperson said of the report: ""This analysis is simply wrong. Our Quest facility was designed some years ago as a demonstration project to prove the underlying CCS concept, while capturing around a third of CO2 emissions.

Image: Shell is one of the companies investing in CCS as it targets investment towards a greener future

""It is not a hydrogen production facility. The hydrogen projects we're planning - like Polaris - will use a new technology that captures more than 90% of emissions. Global Witness are comparing apples with pears.""

But independent experts say facilities like Shell's are examples of blue hydrogen and it is right we should learn lessons from the technology and heed warnings about the emissions.

""I call it 'blue hydrogen mark one'"" explains Professor Nilay Shah, head of department of chemical engineering at Imperial College London.

""If you capture what we call the 'process emissions' only you might be capturing roughly half the C02 emissions.

""[But] It demonstrates how to go about many elements of the system. Not only capturing the carbon dioxide but also cleaning it up, compressing it, transporting it and storing it. And from that we can learn how to go to the much higher capture rates.""

The debate over blue hydrogen is prescient because there are a number of plans underway to build facilities in the UK, and blue hydrogen also has a central role in the UK government's strategy.

All UK-based proposals plan to use the most modern iterations of this technology with high capture rates.

One of them, led by energy firm Equinor, plans to develop what it calls the UK's first ""at-scale"" blue hydrogen facility.

Image: Equinor's plans for the site are expected to create tens of thousands of jobs. Pic: px Group

The project, called Hydrogen to Humber Saltend (H2H Saltend), will provide the beginnings of a ""decarbonised industrial cluster"" in the Humber region and is part of a larger move to provide clean energy to vast swathes of industry in the North East.

The project is also expected to create tens of thousands of jobs.

""I think that we should be incredibly proud of these opportunities, this will really create an international spotlight on these industrial regions,"" explained Dan Sadler, Equinor's UK VP for low carbon solutions.

While critics say it is wrong to be investing in technology that still requires the burning of fossil fuels and the money would be better spent on scaling entirely renewable sources, he argues blue hydrogen is a practical, positive solution now.

""I think it's the right technology, the right scale at the right time.

""What we need to be able to do is start the hydrogen economy and we need to start at a scale that can justify the infrastructure.""

""You can't jump to utopia, you have to step there. We may all agree that in the longer term an entirely self-sustaining green hydrogen market may be the ultimate panacea.

""But the reality is that the climate emergency is now, we need to be making tangible impacts on climate change obligations.""

Global Witness and others point out that carbon capture rates alone are not enough to assess the carbon footprint of any such sites as they don't include the emissions from the fossil gas supply chain and other related activities.

The UK government is set to introduce a 'low carbon hydrogen standard' to ensure that sites being developed are low emissions although the exact rate of that standard has yet to be decided.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120171420/https://news.sky.com/story/climate-change-shell-carbon-capture-facility-secures-just-48-of-hydrogen-production-emissions-12520938;'ARTICLE-6: environment'

The Jack Russell terrier, called Millie, went missing after coming loose from her lead in Havant, The Guardian reported.

She was found stranded on mudflats near Portsmouth, with rising tides threatening to sweep her out to sea, prompting a rescue effort to swing into action.

Police, firefighters, and coastguards tried tirelessly for four days to rescue her, but were left scratching their heads when even kayaking to her wouldn't work.

The chances of Millie being reunited with her owner seemed increasingly unlikely, when a rescuer had the idea of attaching a sausage to a drone with the hope of tempting her to safety.

The chair of the Denmead Drone Search and Rescue team, Chris Taylor, told The Guardian: ""It was a crazy idea.

""One of the local residents on the beach where we were flying from supplied us with the sausages - I think they were from Aldi. The woman cooked them up for us and we attached them with string.""

Luckily, the pork-dangling plan worked, with the terrier following the sausage towards her rescuers, away from the rising tides, to safety.

'The last resort'

""If we hadn't... got her away from that area the tide would have come in and she would have been at risk of drowning,"" said Mr Taylor.

""It was something we had never tried before - the sausages were the last resort.""

Mr Taylor said it was a rescue method teams facing the same challenge in the future might want to try.

He said: ""We certainly would consider using sausages again: every dog and search operation is always going to be different, but if we were ever in a similar situation again we would employ the same methods to lure the dog.""

Ran away a second time

The maximum take-off weight of the drone had to be checked before attaching the sausage to it to make sure it would fly.

Once on higher ground, Millie ran away a second time, leaving her owner Emma Oakes worried once again for her safety.

The pet was eventually found inland from the marsh and ran into the arms of her owner's father when she was found.

His announcement that he was crossing the floor just before Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday came as a shock to many, but he is believed to have been in talks with the Opposition since October.

Mr Wakeford said the ""partygate"" scandal confirmed his decision after ""many months"" of sleepless nights over the government's decisions, from free schools meals and Universal Credit to the Owen Paterson affair and lockdown parties.

His defection has raised questions over whether there will be a by-election but, due to the rules it is unlikely.

Does an MP defecting automatically trigger a by-election?

No. There are no rules requiring a by-election if an MP crosses the floor.

There still could be a by-election though, as there is often pressure to call one when an MP defects.

But other parts of the Labour Party think there should be a by-election, with the left-wing section Momentum calling for one as they do not think Mr Wakeford should be in the party.

Joshua Harcup, youth officer for Bury South's Labour Party, is pushing for Mr Wakeford to call a by-election as it is ""about democracy"".

He told Sky News: ""I think it's positive that he's changed his mind but as you can see from some of the Whatsapp messages leaked yesterday, he's made some comments which are abusive about the Labour Party.

""I would like him to apologise. He would not get my support as our candidate as he doesn't share Labour values.""

History shows by-elections after a defection are a huge risk Tamara Cohen Political correspondent @tamcohen Defections are very rare, and the MP who ""crosses the floor"" often ends up mistrusted by their old colleagues and new comrades. Holding a by-election is not required, unless the MP decides to do so. This precedent was set in 2014 when Tory MPs Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless defected in quick succession to UKIP and both held their seats in by-elections. But it's a huge risk and arguably stopped others joining them. None of the famous Tory to Labour defectors – pro-EU Tory Quentin Davies to Labour in 2007, Alan Howarth to Labour on the eve of its conference in 1995 in a blow to John Major, or Shaun Woodward, a Tory shadow minister to New Labour in 1999, held by-elections. Tory cabinet ministers are publicly calling for a by-election, but with a majority of 402 in a seat held by Labour since 1997, senior figures privately concede it's not a contest they are eager for.

Do the Conservatives want a by-election?

Yes.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News he would be ""very happy with a by-election"".

He added: ""I think given that the people of Bury South rightly voted Conservative in 2019, they wanted to get Brexit done, they want to see a strong economy and all of that, and now they've got an MP that has changed his affiliation without their permission, why not give them a say?""

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also backed a by-election in Bury South, telling ITV Mr Wakeford ""should front up to his constituents"".

Does Mr Wakeford want a by-election?

He has not said either way since his defection.

However, in 2020, the MP co-sponsored and backed a bill that would enable constituents to recall their MP and call a by-election if they ""voluntarily change their political party affiliation"".

Not only will it allow film producers to make movies while orbiting the Earth, but SEE predicts that it will also host sporting events in space and social media influencers who want to make content 250 miles above the planet.

The module - SEE-1 - will form part of the ISS's new commercial arm, Axiom Station, who will also handle construction, and will eventually float free in 2028.

""SEE-1 is an incredible opportunity for humanity to move into a different realm and start an exciting new chapter in space,"" SEE founders Dmitry and Elena Lesnevsky said.

Speaking on Thursday, the US leader said he has been ""absolutely clear with President Putin"" that ""if any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion"".

That invasion, he said, would be met with a ""severe and coordinated economic response,"" which has been ""laid out very clearly with President Putin"".

He also acknowledged that Russia could ""use measures other than overt military actions,"" and referenced the incursion into the Donbas region, where ""grey zone attacks"" were undertaken by ""Russian soldiers not wearing Russian uniform"".

Mr Biden appeared to be clarifying the confusion around the position of America and it's NATO allies after he was heavily criticised for saying a ""minor incursion"" would elicit a lesser response.

The US Treasury Department has also levied new sanctions against four Ukrainian officials, including two current members of parliament, who they say are part of the Russian influence effort to set the pretext for an invasion.

The sanctions name parliamentarians Taras Kozak and Oleh Voloshyn and two former government officials.

According to the government, all four have been involved in disinformation efforts by Russia's federal security service, the FSB.

'Russia looking for excuse to invade Ukraine' - but US insists week of diplomacy has not failed

Image: President Joe Biden has warned Russia not to invade Ukraine

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is preparing to meet his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, in Geneva on Friday, in a bid to ease tensions between the country and the West.

However, talks seem likely to fail and the US diplomat said: ""These are difficult issues we are facing and resolving them won't happen quickly.

""I certainly don't expect we'll solve them in Geneva tomorrow.""

Meanwhile, Mr Biden appeared convinced Russia would mount an attack, and said on Thursday: ""My guess is he will move in; he has to do something.""

However, he warned that Mr Putin would pay a ""dear price"" in lives lost and a possible cut off from the global banking system if he does.

On Thursday, Russia announced sweeping naval drills in several parts of the world and claims the West is plotting ""provocations"" in neighbouring Ukraine.

An estimated 100,000 Russian troops are now believed to be on the border with Ukraine as part of massive joint war games with Belarus, which will involve more than 140 warships and 60 aircraft.

Analysis: Biden swift to clarify confusing and contradictory remarks Mark Stone US correspondent @Stone_SkyNews The White House was swift to clarify the comments made by President Biden and the president himself has now sought to provide his own clarity. It’s no wonder clarity was needed. His original words on Wednesday evening were confused, contradictory and dangerously undermined any pretence of Western and NATO unity. With his comments - in which he publically drew a distinction between invasion and incursion (which he didn’t define) and admitted divisions within NATO - he caused enough angst in Kyiv to prompt the Ukrainian President to speak up. In making the comments, President Biden will also have sent a confirmatory message to President Putin that there isn’t a real, united conviction among western leaders. Even his clarifying comments prompt further questions. He seemed to suggest that a repeat of the Crimea playbook, with ‘Little Green Men’ (Russian troops without their insignia) taking over a part of Ukraine, would prompt a lesser response from the West and not the stinging sanctions. Did he mean that? It’s not clear. The broad point is this - President Putin is seeing confirmation of what he suspected and wanted to test: the unity and resolve among the West isn't all that strong. As things stand, Putin probably thinks he can threaten to invade and get concessions from the West in response, or he can go ahead with a small Crimea-style invasion (with those little green men again) and get away with it. Remarkable.

""The drills are intended to practice navy and air force action to protect Russian national interests in the world's oceans and to counter military threats to the Russian Federation,"" the Russian ministry said.

In response, Britain's armed forces have flown thousands of anti-tank weapons to the former Soviet satellite state amid fears of an imminent invasion of Ukraine.

From midday on Friday, people will no longer be restricted to table service and sitting in groups of six at restaurants, pubs and bars.

The current three-household limit on gatherings inside private homes will also be scrapped, but no more than 30 people will be allowed to stay overnight.

What are the coronavirus rules around the UK?

Northern Ireland's Department of Health has also agreed to change its self-isolation period to five days - providing people have negative lateral flow test results on days five and six - in line with the rest of the UK from Friday.

The guidance on working from home will be relaxed to working remotely ""where you can"", while people will no longer be required to prove they are exempt from wearing a face mask in public spaces.

From 26 January, nightclubs will be able to reopen and vaccine passports will no longer be required to attend venues like pubs, restaurants and cinemas.

They will remain a requirement for nightclubs and indoor events that are unseated or partially seated with 500 or more people.

Social distancing requirements in offices and other workplaces will also be lifted next Wednesday.

Further changes could happen next month

Announcing the changes on Thursday, the executive said the new measures would be reviewed again on 10 February.

Further changes could include removing the requirements on face coverings in public spaces, guidance on lateral flow testing before socialising and the rules around test and trace.

Nightclubs and indoor events have been banned in Northern Ireland since 26 December in a bid to curb COVID cases as the Omicron variant spread through the UK.

Dancing has also been banned in hospitality venues.

Speaking ahead of the announcement, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said that while the pandemic was not over, the new variant has peaked in Northern Ireland.

She said: ""The pandemic is far from over but we are cautiously optimistic.

A large number of MPs, possibly a majority, are unhappy with Boris Johnson's premiership.

However they are unsure when to defenestrate him, how to do so, and - most importantly of all - who should replace him.

Sue Gray report: When is inquiry due, what does it mean for Boris Johnson and who decides what happens next?

Many MPs will tell you that the defection of Bury South MP Christian Wakeford has eased pressure on the prime minister - it is certainly true it has provided a new and helpful rallying point for Mr Johnson.

However this does not alter the fact most continue to wait for the report by Mr Johnson's top official, Sue Gray, into the 15 or so parties in Downing Street including the one the PM attended.

At that point, some will put in letters of no confidence whatever it says, some will judge his fate on the report and some will man the barricades to defend him.

A vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson remains a distinct possibility at this point.

But will this resolve the question of Mr Johnson's future?

If he loses, he is out. If he wins, the scale of the revolt against him could still prove ultimately fatal: Theresa May won her vote of no confidence by 200-117 in December 2018, and she was out six months later.

A growing Tory civil war could also hamper Mr Johnson's reset if he wins a vote of no confidence.

Sheila is the 120th emergency patient to be seen by the Royal Preston Hospital.

And it is only two o'clock in the afternoon.

She has ongoing issues with her spine and needs chronic pain management.

Not far from Sheila is Muriel Hargreaves. Muriel tells me she is 88 and a half years old.

The half she says is important. Muriel has been admitted to hospital with high blood pressure. It is giving her problems with her heart.

She says: ""It's a certain problem that I'm having with my heart. They've not named it yet because they've not come to a final conclusion.

""But they're doing everything possible to get to the bottom before…before I go home.""

Muriel has been here for more than 24 hours. She should be in a bed on a ward but there is no space.

That means all the investigations to find out what is wrong with her have to be carried out in the emergency department.

It is not ideal but it is the only way to make sure she receives the same care and treatment.

Image: Muriel Hargreaves has been admitted to hospital with high blood pressure

Samantha Wright is the emergency department nurse who is looking after Muriel.

'Not missing out on care'

She tells me: ""She's not missing out on any care at all. Normally, the investigations that are carried out on the ward, ie the speciality that she's under, would normally review her on the ward and put a plan in place.

""But unfortunately due to there being no beds in medicine which Muriel requires at the moment... all those investigations have happened here in the emergency department.""

Andy Curran is a consultant in emergency medicine and he began his career here at the Royal Preston Hospital 25 years ago.

One of the most challenging winters

In that time he has seen many difficult winters. But this is one of his most challenging.

""Each time that we think things can't get any harder they seem to do, and the patients that have been coming through have been coming through in increasing numbers,"" he said.

Mr Curran told me the patients who were coming in were much sicker because they had delayed treatment.

These patients, he said, were ""going up and up"".

Eleven-year-old Katrina Ward is typical of the patients who are presenting later. She has suspected appendicitis and has been in pain for the last month.

She came into hospital when she fell sick at school this morning.

""I was going to school,"" Katrina said. ""But it was already painful before I went, it was just like a normal morning, and I got to school and it got really painful so I decided to call my mum.""

On the hospital grounds, construction for one of the regional Nightingale surge hubs is continuing.

Image: A Nightingale surge hub is being constructed on the site of the hospital just in case coronavirus cases dramatically rise

It will provide extra capacity in case of a surge in Omicron admissions.

That surge did not materialise in numbers that could overwhelm the NHS and the prime minister has lifted Plan B restrictions because of the falling COVID infections.

Will the gamble pay off? Plan B rules to end - but is it too soon?

Kevin McGee, chief executive of the trust which manages the Royal Preston Hospital, says the hub is an important safety net should there be another wave.

""The Nightingale surgery if we don't use that, I would say that is success, it's a facility should it be needed. It's an insurance policy, and it's the right thing to do. So we are planning for the worst, but clearly hoping for the best.""

From mid-March, police will start checking people's vaccination status during routine checks.

Those who cannot prove their vaccination status after being asked in writing to do so will be fined up to €600 (£498).

Pregnant women, people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, and those who have recovered from the virus in the past six months will be exempt.

MPs voted 137 to 33 on Thursday in favour of the mandate, which will apply to all adults aged 18 and over.

The bill must now pass the upper house of Austria's parliament and be signed by President Alexander Van der Bellen - steps which are seen as formalities.

US relations with China and Russia ""remain tense"", with the countries developing hypersonic missiles and engaging in ""nuclear modernisation and expansion efforts"".

'It didn't sit comfortably'

Speaking on Thursday, Mr Wakeford said the ""threat"" left him questioning his position in the Conservative Party.

A Labour source has said the vote related to free school meals.

""I was threatened that I would not get the school for Radcliffe if I did not vote in one particular way,"" Mr Wakeford said.

""This is a town that's not had a high school for the best part of 10 years, and how would you feel when holding back the regeneration of a town for a vote?

""It didn't sit comfortably and that was when I was really starting to question my place, where I was, and ultimately where I am now.""

The Manchester Evening News reported in February 2021 that the ""long awaited high school in Radcliffe"" had been given the green light by ministers as one of four new free schools in Greater Manchester.

Bury county councillor Mike Smith, who represents Radcliffe West, said a request for planning permission for the school was due to be submitted early this year.

The first intake of pupils is expected in September 2024.

'Incredibly warm welcome'

Speaking alongside Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves at an event in Bury, Mr Wakeford said his new party was ""ready to provide an alternative government that this country can be proud of and deserves, and certainly not to be embarrassed by, and this is one of the reasons why I'm here today"".

He told reporters after the speech that he had been given an ""incredibly warm welcome"" from the party and said any former Tory colleagues thinking about following his lead should ""give me a shout"".

Mr Wakeford's claim of a threat comes after a senior Conservative MP alleged fellow Tories who want the PM to resign have been intimidated by party whips.

In March 2020, the government ordered Greater Manchester Combined Authority to implement a plan to bring air quality to within legal limits.

Some 1,200 premature deaths every year in Greater Manchester are linked to air pollution.

But on Thursday, the Greater Manchester Air Quality Administration Committee said an urgent review was needed by the government into the plan's funding.

Greater Manchester's Clean Air Zone, due to be introduced in phases from the end of May this year, would see the worst-polluting vehicles charged up to £70 a day to drive in the area.

But the committee said global vehicle-supply chain issues, rising inflation and post-COVID economic recovery was making it difficult for businesses to source greener, affordable vehicles.

Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, said he was ""pleased"" by the decision, adding ""it is impossible to proceed on the current basis without causing real hardship to some of our residents"".

""It's about getting to clean air as quickly as we can,"" Mr Burnham told Sky News, ""but enabling people to come with us on that journey so that greener really is fairer"".

Image: Andy Burnham praised the move

Sky News spoke to several businesses who said they were pleased by the move.

Jade Hutchinson is a small-flock sheep farmer in Bolton.

Under the current rules, she would have to pay up £70 extra a week to use her second-hand pick-up truck.

Image: Jade Hutchinson told Sky News the new charge was 'penalising people for working'

Ms Hutchinson told Sky News the new charge was ""penalising people for working"".

The charges, she says, would mean her small businesses would not be viable.

""If these leaders are thinking about lives, they shouldn't be affecting people's lives by charging them and taking their livelihoods away from them,"" she said.

But Julia Kovaliova, who lives with her three children near one of Manchester's most polluted roads, said that any delay was putting health at risk.

""My 12-year old, Maksim, has asthma that I believe was caused by growing up next to such a polluted road,"" Ms Kovaliova told Sky News.

""I know this is a sensitive issue, when people say their jobs are going to suffer, but city centres are not safe for children right now and we have to do something about it.""

Data shows that 152 areas across Greater Manchester have levels of air pollution that are unsafe and illegal, according to World Health Organisation standards.

The Duke of Cambridge, who was 15 when his mother Princess Diana died in 1997, also told 11-year-old Deacon Glover: ""I know how you feel.""

The boy's mother, Grace Taylor, died last year aged 28.

William and the Duchess of Cambridge spent about 15 minutes talking to Deacon and his great-grandmother, Carole Ellis, during a visit to Church on the Street in Burnley, Lancashire.

William, 39, an Aston Villa fan, chatted to Deacon about football, but the youngster, who was wearing a Burnley shirt, seemed unimpressed at first.

""He thought it was a footballer coming here so he was gutted when he found out it was William and Kate,"" one volunteer at the centre said.

William and Deacon talked about Burnley FC

But gradually he became chattier, as William asked him about Burnley FC's prospects and pointed out that his father, the Prince of Wales, was a supporter of the club after directing some of his charities to work in the town.

""I only found out a few years ago that my dad is a Burnley fan,"" he said.

He told Deacon and his great-grandmother that he hoped his own children would follow him in supporting Aston Villa. ""I need to spread the love a bit,"" he said.

Kate holds baby girl

The royal couple also posed for photographs with other families and Kate found herself holding a three-and-a-half-month-old girl.

She cooed at Anastasia Barrie while standing beside her parents Trudi, a volunteer, and Alastair Barrie, who is on the centre's committee.

The duke and duchess had asked to visit the centre after watching a television report in December about its work with Burnley's most vulnerable people during the coronavirus pandemic and finding it ""very moving"".

Pastor Mick Fleming set up Church on the Street in 2019 to help the homeless and disadvantaged living in Burnley and surrounding areas.

Housed in a former gym and funded by donations, it provides a food bank, clothing bank, hot showers, laundry, a cafe, recovery groups, addiction and mental health support, access to a qualified counsellor, and a safe space for up to 200 people at any one time.

'I'm very grateful to the royal couple'

Pastor Mick, who leads church services, said he hoped the visit would help provide extra support for the people using his services.

Mark Drakeford said the country has ""passed the Omicron peak"" and can keep lifting restrictions as part of its ""careful and phased plan"".

The first minister said: ""We remain cautiously confident the public health situation is heading in the right direction and next week we will be able to complete the move to alert level zero, unless the situation changes for the worse.

""We are in this position thanks to the efforts of everyone in Wales and our fantastic vaccination programme.

""It is important that everyone continues to follow the rules and the guidance to help keep themselves and their loved ones safe, including taking up the offer of a booster vaccine if they haven't already done so.""

What is being planned for COVID restrictions in Wales?

From Friday, Wales will move to alert level zero for all outdoor activities.

This means there will be no limits on the number of people who can take part in outdoor activities, while crowds will be allowed at outdoor sporting events once more.

Outdoor hospitality will also be able to operate without additional reasonable measures, such as the rule of six and two-metre social distancing.

COVID passes will still be required for entry to larger outdoor events of more than 4,000 people if unseated and over 10,000 people if seated.

From 28 January, the plan is for Wales to complete the move to alert level zero.

This will mean working from home will no longer be a legal requirement, while the rule of six will be removed in hospitality, cinemas and theatres.

Social distancing requirements in workplaces and places open to the public will be scrapped.

In a letter to Ms Trump, politicians say they are seeking her voluntary cooperation and want to talk to her in early February about the events leading up to and during the insurrection on 6 January 2021.

The US House of Representatives committee believes she was in direct contact with her father, former US President Donald Trump, during key moments when his supporters stormed the Capitol to try to stop the certification of Joe Biden's presidential win.

As one of his advisers, she was also ""present in the Oval Office"" for key conversations, the panel said.

The committee said it also wants to find out what she knows about her father's efforts to pressure then-vice president Mike Pence to reject the 2020 election results.

The panel said this includes a telephone call she witnessed between them on the morning of the riot.

Keith Kellogg, who was Mr Pence's national security adviser, allegedly told investigators he was there and heard Mr Trump question whether Mr Pence had the courage to delay the congressional counting of the electoral votes.

The Constitution makes it clear that a vice president's role is largely ceremonial in the certification process

The committee also said it was probing whether Donald Trump's own White House lawyers concluded that he attempted to interfere with the election outcome.

They also think Ms Trump may have heard about these alleged efforts from Mr Pence's staff, members of Congress and the White House counsel's office.

Serial rebel, Brexiteer and Tory backbencher Steve Baker helped establish the group of around 20 MPs who are concerned about the costs of reaching net zero.

And his warning comes amid an escalating cost of living crisis.

Image: Many fear the costs of reaching net zero which will include the move to electric cars

Mr Baker told Sky News: ""I genuinely believe that when the full costs of net zero start hitting us, if people have never been given a choice at the ballot box, we could end up with something bigger than the poll tax, certainly bigger than Brexit, because the numbers of people hit by it and their inability to cope will be huge.

""I am sick to death of people talking to me about food and fuel poverty, and then piling costs on the poor.

""This is a fundamental moral issue.

'MPs know this is going to hit all voters and hit them hard'

""I've started three big projects of MPs on the issue of the day - one on Brexit, one on COVID, which of course affected everybody, and one on net zero.

""Of the three of them, the one that grew fastest by miles was net zero, simply because members of parliament know this is going to hit all voters and hit them hard and hit them fast and they aren't going to like it.""

Mr Baker's warning comes as the prime minister is fighting another significant division - battling to regain support from within his party as it responds to the ongoing ""partygate"" scandal.

The Net Zero Scrutiny Group, which includes former cabinet minister Esther McVey MP, recently signed an open letter demanding the government scrap green levies on energy bills and increase the amount of gas extracted from the North Sea.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:42 Will the govt's net zero strategy work?

But the larger, greener wing of the Conservative party sees things very differently.

Warnings of social unrest over net zero 'populist' and irresponsible

Its members point out that some of those belonging to the Net Zero Scrutiny Group are affiliated with the Global Warming Policy Foundation which has been described by scientists as a climate-sceptical organisation responsible for pushing misinformation, something it has denied.

Mr Baker is a trustee of the foundation.

Conservative Environment Network member Chris Skidmore MP said warnings of social unrest over net zero were irresponsible and populist.

In line with Boris Johnson, he and his colleagues see the prospect of a ""green industrial revolution"" and the massive investment it will require as fundamental to driving opportunity and stability in the decades to come.

They also view the net zero strategy as the answer to the energy price crisis that is helping to drive up the cost of living, arguing that the switch to renewables and nuclear will eventually provide a greater degree of energy sovereignty and reduce exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices.

Mr Skidmore told Sky News: ""My greatest fear is that we end up with this race to the bottom, of… parties wanting to politicise energy prices, politicise net zero, and the only sort of winners in that are going to be the populists.

Image: The government has promised a range of support which includes helping some replace gas boilers with heat pumps

""We do need to look at making sure that we do tackle the issues around cost of living, that we do make sure that we argue the case that actually net zero is not just about going green, it is about supporting jobs for the future, actually creating an entirely new economy.

""It will be painful and difficult, but we don't, as a result, want to have a reaction that throws it entirely out of the window.""

The target of reaching net zero by 2050 was enshrined in law in 2019 by then prime minister Theresa May, and was included in that year's Conservative Party manifesto.

The government has promised a range of support, particularly for those on lower incomes, for things like insulation and replacing gas boilers with heat pumps.

It has not ruled out tax rises or reduced public spending to help meet the huge cost of decarbonising homes, transport, manufacturing and more, but it simply cannot pay for everything.

What will be the price we have to pay?

The government's Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the total investment of public and private money needed to make net zero happen will be £1.4trn up to 2050, but this sum will be offset by more than £1trn in savings as a result.

The Climate Change Committee, which is the independent body that advises the government, says that spending needs to ramp up quickly to £50bn a year by 2030, five times what is being spent now.

We visited Lewes in Sussex - a relatively wealthy constituency that voted Conservative in the last two elections and where the Green Party has also been growing in popularity.

As in the rest of the country, there is broad support for tackling climate change and for the net zero target, but growing concern among residents about how much they might have to pay for it personally amid a cost of living crisis.

Farmer Will Kirkham said he was worried about the total cost of getting to net zero but also the potential for new taxes or more expensive products and bills in the short-term.

""Farmers don't make much money as it is, let alone with an extra forking out of however much it's going to be to change it all,"" he said.

Pensioner Peter Gibson said climate change needs to be tackled but simply could not afford any extra upfront costs, even to deliver savings in the future.

""Some of these homes, flats and houses need doing and you just haven't got the money to do it with because everything goes up, even food,"" he said.

But head brewer at Harvey's Miles Jenner said he believed there was little choice.

33;33;1408;1408;Tinder charges more for young gays, lesbians and over-30s, claims Which?;Friday 21 January 2022 03:58, UK;[];['online dating'];['users', 'price', 'equality', 'lesbians', 'young', '30', 'tinder', 'paid', 'offer', 'over30s', 'difference', 'charges', 'discrimination', 'claims', 'average', 'gays'];"Tinder is charging young gay and lesbian users and people over 30 more for its premium service, according to an investigation by Which?

The watchdog says its research could suggest discrimination by the dating app and a breach of UK law.

Which? asked almost 200 mystery shoppers to create real profiles and make a note of prices quoted for Tinder Plus - a premium package with perks such as unlimited ""Likes"" and ""Rewinds"" and the ability to undo accidental selections.

It showed some gay and lesbian users were paying more, with an average premium of more than 10% (£6.74) compared to bisexual users, and more than 8% (£5.28) compared to heterosexual users.

Image: Tinder said the price difference was 'a discount for younger users'

This trend was driven by the youngest age group, with Which? finding that gay and lesbian people aged 18 to 29 paid £60.15 on average - 37% more than heterosexual users aged under 30 (who paid £44.06 on average) and 30% more than bisexual users under 30 (£46.09).

When it came to age, those in the 30 to 49-year-old age bracket paid 48% more - a £24 difference - and the over-50s paid 46% more - a £23.19 difference - on average for a 12-month Tinder Plus subscription.

Which? said it had reported its findings to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and the Information Commissioner's Office.

The group's director of policy and advocacy, Rocio Concha, said the research suggested ""unlawful price discrimination"", whether or not it is intentional on Tinder's part, and potentially unlawful processing of personal data.

""If regulators decide that Tinder's personalised pricing is breaking the law, then the dating app giant must face strong action.""

Tinder said it was ""categorically untrue that our pricing structure discriminates in any way by sexual preference"".

It told Which? that older people did have to pay more in some countries, but said the price difference was ""a discount for younger users"".

The Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful to charge people of one sexual orientation more than others unless there is a clear justification for this.

The consumer group noted that it was occasionally justifiable under UK law to offer age-based price variations for the same product or service, such as discounts to over-65s or students, where it can be shown there is a legitimate basis for this.

However, it said that in the case of Tinder it was unclear as to why over-30s were paying more.

What has Tinder said about the claims?

A Tinder spokeswoman told Which?: ""Tinder is free to use and the vast majority of our members enjoy our app without upgrading to the paid experience.

""However, we do offer a variety of subscription options to help our members stand out and match with new people more efficiently.

""Tinder operates a global business and, in some geographies, we offer discounted subscriptions to younger members.

""In addition, we frequently offer promotional rates which can vary based on factors like location or length of subscription. No other demographic information is considered in our pricing structure.""

An EHRC spokeswoman said: ""As Britain's equality regulator it is our job to protect, uphold and enforce equality laws. We take reports of discrimination very seriously.

""This report of potential discrimination by Tinder is concerning. We will consider these findings by Which? and respond in due course.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121041004/http://news.sky.com/story/tinder-charges-more-for-young-gays-lesbians-and-over-30s-claims-which-12521152;'ARTICLE-3: business and economy'

The people of Croydon hate this label - and they're doing everything they can to get rid of it.

But there's a reason for this unwanted reputation.

Grim rollcall of young victims killed in capital this year

Image: Youth worker Anthony King organised the event to send a message to young people

Last year was the worst on record for teenage murders in London. There were 30 in total, and five happened in Croydon - more than any other borough in the capital.

But the community is fighting back. The killings have sparked the birth of a new movement.

A group of more than 100 community members - including youth workers, schools, the Met and local politicians - have united to tackle knife crime in the area.

Image: Jermaine Cools, 14, was stabbed to death in November 2021

""Croydon, this has to stop!"" Anthony King's booming voice echoes around the streets of his home town.

The youth worker has organised a march to send a message to the young people. Hundreds join him to march through the main strip of shops.

Anthony tells me: ""We're here to send the youth a message - that we're here for you. We need mothers to stop the narrative that there's no men in our communities.

""There are men in our communities and there are men that want to stop the knife crime. The parents in this community should stop and search their children before the Met do.

""I'm working with the Met, look at my skin colour. I will stand with the Met until we've got this problem dealt with.""

Image: Jermaine's father Julius Cools says 'it has to stop now'

The march passed the spot in London Road where 14-year-old Jermaine Cools was stabbed to death in November 2021.

His father, Julius Cools, strokes his picture at the scene as the procession passes.

Julius tells me: ""Jermaine was our life - he meant everything to us. My son lost his life, and the boy who killed him has lost his too, because he's in prison now.

""There's no end to this. It has to stop now.""

Image: Tilisha Goupall says she is 'scared to have kids'

I also meet Tilisha Goupall, whose 15-year-old brother Jermaine was stabbed to death in Croydon in 2017.

""These young kids don't understand the impact of carrying a knife. I can't put into words how this has affected my family. I don't want anyone to go through what we've been through.""

She added: ""I'm scared to have kids. If I have a child, is my child going to get stabbed? Am I going to have to go through that trauma again? Because of what's happening now - with all the teenagers dying.

""Am I going to have to raise a child only to know that one day they'll be killed? That's a trauma I don't want.""

Image: Jermaine Goupall, 15, was stabbed to death in Croydon in 2017

After her brother's death, Tilisha launched the Justice for Jermaine Foundation to educate young people about the impact of carrying knives.

The march was part of a concerted effort to take the youths off the streets and out of the clutches of gangs.

One of the many organisations involved is United to Change and Inspire (UTCAI). Its co-founder Troy Davis said: ""The reason for the violence comes down to many things - you just have to look at the economics.

Image: Troy Davis is the co-founder of United to Change and Inspire (UTCAI)

""The first thing that is going to be cut is the thing that affects young people, so when you take away hope - what do you think is going to happen? Of course, it's going to spiral out of control.

""And that's what we're here to do - to provide opportunities for the young people here and making sure that they progress in society.""

The combined efforts to combat knife crime in Croydon include ex-gang members. I was invited to meet Jay Jay, who has mentored more than 1,000 youths in the area.

He was working with a teenager who has recently turned his back on gangs.

He told me: ""I got involved in selling drugs, carrying knives, getting involved in gangs. But me going through all that gave me a first-hand insight into how our youth think.

""It makes it much easier to get through to these kids. They're much more likely to engage with me because they know I've lived it - I've been to prison and turned my life around.""

35;35;1410;1410;Pension scandal: Long-term underpayment of thousands is a 'shameful shambles', says group of MPs;Friday 21 January 2022 04:02, UK;[];['pensions'];['errors', 'scandal', 'pac', 'mps', 'department', 'pensioners', 'group', 'underpaid', 'underpayment', 'longterm', 'thousands', 'underpayments', 'pension', 'dwp', 'state', 'shambles', 'shameful'];"The long-term underpayment of state pensioners, an unknown number of whom will have died without receiving what they were owed, is a ""shameful shambles"", according to a public spending watchdog.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) estimates it has underpaid 134,000 pensioners, mostly women, over £1bn of their state pension entitlement, with some errors dating as far back as 1985.

In January 2021, DWP started an exercise to correct the errors - the ninth such exercise since 2018, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said.

Dame Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the PAC, said: ""Departments that make errors through maladministration have a duty to put those it wronged back in the position they should have been, without the error.

Image: The handling of the crisis has been described as a 'shameful shambles'

""In reality DWP can never make up what people have actually lost, over decades, and in many cases it's not even trying.

""An unknown number of pensioners died without ever getting their due and there is no current plan to pay back their estates.

""DWP is now on its ninth go at fixing these mistakes since 2018, the specialised staff diverted to fix this mess costing tens of millions more to the taxpayer and predictable consequences in delays to new pension claims.

""And there is no assurance that the errors that led to these underpayments in the first place will not be repeated in the correction exercise.

""This is a shameful shambles.""

The errors mostly affect widows, divorcees and women who rely on their husband's pension contributions for some of their pension.

Complex pension rules and a reliance on highly manual systems led to the underpayments.

The committee of MPs said the underlying IT system relied on to manage millions of pensioner records dates back to 1988.

Quality checks failed to identify the systematic underpayments and small errors added up over years to significant sums of money.

The PAC said the department should consider whether there are cost-effective ways to upgrade its IT systems ""as a matter of urgency"".

How much will it cost to fix the errors?

There is currently no formal plan for contacting the next of kin where a pensioner who was underpaid is dead, the committee said.

The DWP is only paying those it has identified as having a legal entitlement to arrears, in some cases many years after the event, and has been inconsistent in paying interest, it added.

Women on pensions as low as £1 a week could be owed 'lottery winning' sums

It has also shown little interest in understanding the further knock-on consequences, including on social care provision, for those it underpaid, MPs said.

Fixing DWP's mistakes comes at great cost to the taxpayer and is expected to cost £24.3 in staff costs alone by the end of 2023, the PAC added.

It also said the department should be treating state pension underpayments as seriously as overpayments.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121041004/http://news.sky.com/story/pension-scandal-long-term-underpayment-of-thousands-is-a-shameful-shambles-says-group-of-mps-12520971;'ARTICLE-5: business and economy'

Boris Johnson confirmed on Wednesday that most measures under Plan B will end on 26 January, while work from home guidance has already been dropped.

Similar announcements have been made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after all four nations have seen a drop in case numbers.

Here are the latest rules in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

England

Restrictions on working from home were dropped by the government on Wednesday, with the prime minister saying England was reverting to Plan A ""because of the extraordinary booster campaign"".

Image: Boris Johnson announced the changes in the House of Commons earlier this week

Mandatory COVID-19 passes for entering nightclubs and large events will end from 27 January, as will the rules around face masks in places where you mix with people you don't usually mix.

Secondary school pupils no longer have to wear face coverings in classrooms and guidance on their use in communal areas will also be removed.

What are the coronavirus rules across the UK

Mr Johnson also said that announcements on travel restrictions and care home visits will come in the coming days.

The legal requirement for people who test positive for coronavirus to self-isolate is expected to end on 24 March but could be brought forward if the data allows.

Current isolation rules remain in place, meaning anyone who returns a positive test result in England will have to isolate for five days.

The length of isolation was cut down from seven days on 17 January and people will be able to end quarantine if they have negative lateral flow test results on days five and six.

Will the gamble pay off? Plan B rules to end in England - but is it too soon?

Scotland

While strict rules remain in place in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced this week that there would be some loosening of restrictions on 24 January.

The three-household limit on indoor gatherings will be scrapped, while the limit on the number of people allowed to attend indoor events will also be dropped.

Social distancing in indoor public spaces will no longer be required and hospitality venues won't have to restrict customers to table service.

Nightclubs will also reopen but face coverings will remain as a legal requirement on public transport and in shops, hospitality and leisure venues.

But from 24 January these two changes will come into force:

The requirement to be fully vaccinated for the purposes of corporate certification will include having a booster if the second dose was more than four months ago.

Wales

Wales will continue on its roadmap back to coronavirus alert level zero later this month, First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed on Thursday.

Mr Drakeford said that the country has ""passed the Omicron peak"" and can keep lifting restrictions as part of its ""careful and phased plan"".

From today, Wales moves to alert level zero for all outdoor activities.

This means there are now no limits on the number of people who can take part in outdoor activities, while crowds are allowed at outdoor sporting events once more.

Outdoor hospitality is also be able to operate without additional reasonable measures, such as the rule of six and two-metre social distancing.

COVID passes are still required for entry to larger outdoor events of more than 4,000 people if unseated and over 10,000 people if seated.

From 28 January, the plan is for Wales to complete the move to alert level zero.

This will mean working from home will no longer be a legal requirement, while the rule of six will be removed in hospitality, cinemas and theatres.

Social distancing requirements in workplaces and places open to the public will be scrapped.

Northern Ireland

From midday today, people will no longer be restricted to table service and sitting in groups of six at restaurants, pubs and bars in Northern Ireland.

The current three-household limit on gatherings inside private homes will also be scrapped, but no more than 30 people will be allowed to stay overnight.

Northern Ireland's Department of Health has also agreed to change its self-isolation period to five days - providing people have negative lateral flow test results on days five and six, from today.

The guidance on working from home will be relaxed to working remotely ""where you can"", while people will no longer be required to prove they are exempt from wearing a face mask in public spaces.

From 26 January, nightclubs will be able to reopen and vaccine passports will no longer be required to attend venues like pubs, restaurants and cinemas.

The new measures will be reviewed on 10 February and further changes could be introduced then.

Republic of Ireland

The Irish government has been given the green light to lift COVID restrictions by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).

Nphet has recommended restrictions around hospitality can be lifted, including the 8pm curfew and live venues and sports venues can return to full capacity.

COVID passes will only be required for international travel but face masks are still recommended in shops and public transport.

Government ministers will meet today to assess the advice before Taoiseach Micheal Martin is due to make an announcement.

It comes after the PM said yesterday that he has seen ""no evidence to support"" claims that Conservative MPs who want him to resign have been intimidated by party officials.

Fears are growing inside 10 Downing Street that former pub landlady Sue Gray could call time on Boris Johnson in her Whitehall report on partygate.

Sky News understands there is nervousness in Number 10 over what the top civil servant's report on the Downing Street parties - which some MPs believe could be published as early as Monday - will reveal.

According to sources, some in Downing Street fear the investigation has unearthed damaging evidence and they are now doubtful the report will clear the prime minister.

Although his allies dispute this, they admit they will not know until the report is published, at which point Mr Johnson has promised to make a Commons statement to MPs.

The PM's enemies claim that after a lull in their campaign to submit letters to 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady demanding a confidence vote, more rebel MPs are poised to strike after the report is published.

However, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss reiterated her support for Mr Johnson during a news conference in Sydney, Australia.

When questioned about the partygate, Ms Truss said: ""The prime minister has my 100% support. He is doing an excellent job. I want the prime minister to continue as long as possible and he is doing a fantastic job.""

The Daily Telegraph reports that Ms Gray has found an email that allegedly confirms allegations that concerns were raised over the event before it took place.

The Guardian describes it as a ""significant email"", The Times say it is a ""critical email"" and the reports claim a senior official warned Number 10 aide Martin Reynolds it broke lockdown rules.

Since the 20 May 2020 event was first highlighted, the PM has urged his political opponents and his Tory critics to wait for Ms Gray's report.

The senior civil servant, 64, who famously took a career break to run a pub in ""bandit country"" in Northern Ireland, has interviewed dozens of Number 10 staffers as well as Mr Cummings and MPs believe publication is now only days away.

Which Conservative MPs have called on the prime minister to quit?

Publication of details of the warning email in Ms Gray's report would leave Mr Johnson in deep trouble over his claims that the 20 May gathering - which he says he attended for 25 minutes - was a ""work event"" and nobody told him it was against COVID-19 regulations.

The PM and his supporters, however, are likely to argue in his defence that while Mr Reynolds was urged to cancel the party the report may conclude that the concerns were not raised with Mr Johnson.

The heightened anticipation of Ms Gray's report comes after a furious row at Westminster over a claim by Tory MP William Wragg that rebel Conservative MPs faced intimidation and blackmail threats from government whips.

The Australian naval ship HMAS Adelaide was expected to set sail on Friday carrying British aid, including 90 family-sized tents, eight community tents, and six wheelbarrows requested by the Tongan government.

At the same time, the Royal Navy's offshore patrol vessel HMS Spey will sail from Tahiti to Tonga carrying water and medical supplies.

HMS Spey is expected to arrive next week and the ship's commanding officer Commander Mike Proudman said: ""I'm proud that the Royal Navy can play its part in the efforts to respond to the devastating volcanic eruption and tsunami in Tonga.""

The UK has also offered to fund the deployment of crisis experts through the United Nations.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""Our thoughts are with those caught up in the appalling devastation and loss of life caused by the tsunami in Tonga.""

What happened in Tonga?

The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai underwater volcano erupted on 13 January and 15 January.

The eruption was so powerful that it could be heard from as far away as Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia.

It also caused a tsunami.

Image: Officials said that three people died in the disaster

Officials from the UN's humanitarian arm estimated that roughly 84,000 people - or more than 80% of Tonga's population - were affected by the eruption.

At least three people were killed - including one Briton, homes have been destroyed on several islands, and the country has been left with a polluted water supply.

The disaster also knocked out communications for the nation of about 105,000 people, cutting it off from the rest of the world.

Humanitarian aid and a message from the Queen

The first planes carrying foreign aid arrived in Tonga on 20 January, five days after the tsunami and once a blanket of ash could be cleared from the airport runway.

They were a Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules and an Australian Globemaster aircraft.

Between them, they carried water containers, desalination equipment, shelters, kitchens, a sweeper to remove ash, generators, hygiene kits, and communications equipment.

Great care was needed, as Tonga is one of the few countries to have avoided any community transmission of COVID-19 so far in the pandemic.

Aid from Japan is also on the way.

Some telephone connections have been restored, but it could take another month for full services to resume.

The Queen sent a message of condolence to His Majesty Tupou VI, the King of Tonga, on Thursday.

""I am shocked and saddened by the impact of the volcanic eruption and tsunami in Tonga,"" she said.

The actress-turned-entrepreneur said the Hands Off My Vagina candle will honour the Roe v Wade case on 22 January.

In the famous 1973 ruling, the US Supreme Court held that a woman's right to an abortion fell within the right to privacy protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

It gave a woman the right to an abortion throughout her pregnancy, defining different levels of state interest for regulating the procedure during the second and third trimesters.

But the ruling has come under pressure in recent years, with Texas and Mississippi among the states trying to curtail those rights.

""And yet, there is a recurring need to say: Hands off. Hands off our vaginas in any context where they're not invited.

""Your reproductive organs; your choice.""

The candle costs $75 (£55) and $25 (£18) of each sale will be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation's Reproductive Freedom Project.

The candles will be sold on Paltrow's Goop website and donations will be made until 1 July.

More on Meat Loaf Meat Loaf 'suing hotel and horror convention' after stage fall

Meat Loaf was one of the most iconic voices in rock music, and tracks such as Dead Ringer For Love, Paradise By The Dashboard Lights and I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That) sold millions of copies during his career.

On screen, his turn as Eddie in the original Rocky Horror Picture Show in 1975 was one of his first film roles, later appearing in huge box office hits such as Spiceworld: The Movie, Wayne's World and The 51st State.

But it was of course Bat Out Of Hell that the most recognisable hit of his career.

It was written by his collaborator Jim Steinman (who died last year, aged 73), and went on to be released three times - though it only ever got to number 8 on the UK singles chart.

The album however, which also featured tracks Heaven Can Wait, Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad and All Revved Up With No Place To Go, remains the fourth biggest selling record of all time (behind Michael Jackson, AC/DC and Whitney Houston), despite never reaching number one in the US or UK.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121091403/https://news.sky.com/story/meat-loaf-us-singer-whose-hits-included-bat-out-of-hell-has-died-aged-74-12521451;'ARTICLE-7: entertainment and culture'

The 3.7% month-on-month decline in sales volumes reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) follows a strong November, when some consumers chose to make Christmas purchases early.

A fall in demand for petrol and diesel, due to more people working from home under Plan B rules, also contributed to the slump.

It was significantly worse than the 0.6% drop that had been pencilled in by forecasters and was the biggest December decline on records going back to 1996.

The fall was also the worst for any month since last January when Britain was coming under a tough new lockdown.

It highlighted the pressure on businesses created by the Omicron variant - and restrictions designed to tackle its spread - over the key festive season.

They will be now hoping for a boost as the Plan B rules are lifted - though separate figures published on Friday by GfK show a sharp drop in consumer confidence blamed on the surge in the cost of living.

The ONS data showed that in December, retail sales even failed to match last year's COVID-hit festive period, charting a 0.9% year-on-year decline.

Heather Bovill, ONS deputy director for surveys and economic indicators, said: ""After strong pre-Christmas trading in November, retail sales fell across the board in December, with feedback from retailers suggesting Omicron impacted on footfall.""

The figures showed that fashion stores saw an 8% decline and department stores dropped 6.3%, while food store volumes were off by 1%.

Online sales were slightly higher as a proportion of the total, at 26.6%, than they were in November, at 26.3%, according to the ONS.

For 2021 as a whole, retail sales were up by 5.1% - a level of growth that has not been higher since 2002.

However that follows a 1.8% decline in 2020 when the pandemic took hold. Compared with 2019, annual retail sales last year were up by a more modest 3.2%.

Bethany Beckett, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the retail sales data added to evidence of Omicron dragging on GDP in December.

She added: ""With encouraging signs that the Omicron outbreak may have turned a corner and the government's Plan B restrictions due to be lifted next week, retail sales may recoup a bit of this fall in January and probably all of it in February and March.

""That said, with the UK's cost of living crisis looming, we expect a weakening in the consumer recovery to dampen retail sales further ahead.""

Households are facing the highest rate of inflation for nearly 30 years as energy bills soar while other products such as food and clothing also become more expensive as firms pass on price pressures.

They are also due to be hit by a national insurance rise in the spring while expected Bank of England rate rises will add to the cost of monthly mortgage payments.

A GfK survey published on Friday showed consumer confidence this month falling to its lowest level since last February when the country was under lockdown.

GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said: ""The UK's financial pulse weakened further this January driven by concerns over personal finances and the general economic situation.

49;49;1426;1426;Omicron 'sub-lineage' BA.2 designated as COVID variant under investigation, says UKHSA;Friday 21 January 2022 15:47, UK;[];['covid-19', 'coronavirus', 'omicron'];['ba2', 'cases', 'sublineage', 'ukhsa', 'ba1', 'latest', 'omicron', 'designated', 'investigation', 'covid', 'evidence', 'uk', 'denmark', 'variant'];"The UK Health Security Agency has designated the Omicron variant sub-lineage, known as BA.2, as a variant under investigation - but current case rates are very low.

Just 53 sequences had been identified in the UK by 10 January, according to the UKHSA, which said it was doing further analysis.

Initial studies from Denmark - where it's quickly taken hold and now makes up around half of Omicron cases - show no difference in hospitalisations between 'original' Omicron and BA.2.

COVID news latest - live updates

Vaccines are also expected to be effective against BA.2 in fighting severe illness, according to Danish health officials.

However, more data is needed to test whether it could be even more transmissible.

The UKHSA's incident director, Dr Meera Chand, said the altered form of Omicron was not unexpected as it is ""the nature of viruses to evolve and mutate"".

""Our continued genomic surveillance allows us to detect them and assess whether they are significant,"" added Dr Chand.

BA.2 is S-gene positive - which may make it harder to show up as Omicron than BA.1, which accounts for 99% of cases.

S-gene target failure helps identify Omicron and can be picked up in PCR tests because as a rule Delta cases have the S-gene and Omicron cases don't.

Some 2,093 sequences of BA.2 had been recorded on an online database from 22 countries - including the UK, the UKHSA said last week.

Denmark's Statens Serum Institut, part of its ministry of health, has said hospitalisations appear to show no difference for the two Omicron lineages but that ""analyses regarding infectiousness and vaccine efficiency etc. are ongoing"".

""It is expected that vaccines also have an effect against severe illness upon BA.2 infection,"" it added.

Some experts have said it's possible the sub-lineage could spread quicker than 'original' Omicron.

Analysis: Something to keep an eye on - but no cause for panic Tom Clarke Science and technology editor @aTomClarke Could the timing be any worse? A new ""sub-lineage"" of Omicron coming along just as the government abandons all COVID restrictions. But while BA.2. is definitely something to be keeping an eye on, it’s not one to worry about too much based on what we know so far. BA.2 has been circulating in the UK for some time at a low level compared with the dominant type of Omicron here (BA.1). In parts of India and the Philippines it is the major version of Omicron. In previous waves there have been big regional differences in what sub-lineage of a particular variant is more, or less dominant. The reason it's been elevated to a ""variant under investigation"" is because of what's happening in Denmark. Yesterday, Danish officials announced the BA.2 sub-lineage now accounted for nearly 50% of cases in Denmark (up from just 20% at Christmas). What's more, the BA.1. version of Omicron and the Delta variant are on their way down in the country. Denmark also finds itself in a spectacular surge in COVID-19 cases. It's good evidence, though not proof, that the BA.2. might be more infectious than BA.1. The question scientists in Denmark are trying to answer is whether case numbers are surging there because of the BA.2 lineage or would have done whichever flavour of Omicron it might be. The feeling among virologists is that BA.2 can't be that much more infectious than BA.1 because if it was, we'd likely have seen it rapidly replace BA.1. in places like the UK. Yet we've seen a very small number of cases. For that reason it's unlikely to lead to a significant new wave of cases here – the difference between Omicron BA.1. and BA.2. is nothing like the difference between Delta and Omicron. Another reason we shouldn't be too concerned is that evidence from Denmark and India shows no evidence of increased severity of illness with BA.2 compared to BA.1. And while BA.1 is genetically different from BA.2, it is not anticipated it will be much better at avoiding antibodies from vaccines or previous infections. The worst that might happen is BA.2 gradually replaces BA.1 in the UK and makes the downward slope of our Omicron wave that little bit longer. But if COVID-19 has taught us anything it's to assume nothing and wait for the evidence. So watch this space.

""Consistent growth across multiple countries is evidence BA.2 may be some degree more transmissible than BA.1,"" tweeted Tom Peacock, a virologist from Imperial College London.

""Unfortunately this is really where the evidence mostly ends - we do not currently have a strong handle on antigenicity, severity or much evidence for how much more transmissibility BA.2 might have over BA.1 - however we can make some guesses/early observations.""

Big drop in England's R value

As coronavirus cases fall in the UK, England's R number range has dropped significantly in the latest UKHSA estimates, moving from 1.1-1.5 to 0.8-1.1.

This suggests the pandemic is shrinking or staying roughly level.

A value between 0.8 and 1.1 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 8 and 11 others.

The lowest range was in London, at 0.7-0.9, the highest in Yorkshire and the North East, at 0.8-1.2.

Meanwhile, latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show decreases in people testing positive for COVID in most of the UK nations in the week ending 15 January.

Around one in 20 are estimated to have had the virus in England, one in 25 in Wales, and one in 20 in Scotland.

Daily COVID-19 cases in the UK averaged nearly 500,000 during the week after Christmas, new analysis suggests.

This is almost three times the official figures recorded by the Department of Health.

An average of 173,400 new cases per day were recorded from 26 December to 1 January, according to the government's COVID dashboard.

But the true number of cases was likely to be nearer 479,100 a day, according to estimates by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The ONS estimates are now nearly three times the equivalent total on the dashboard.

The sharp difference in totals reflects just how many cases are being missed in the dashboard figures, which count only those people who have reported themselves as having tested positive for the virus.

This means the numbers are affected by how many people are coming forward for tests, have chosen to report their test results, or who are taking a test because they know they have coronavirus symptoms.

Speaking during a news conference in Geneva following his meeting, Mr Blinken said the discussion with Mr Lavrov was not a negotiation but ""a candid exchange of views"".

""I conveyed the position of the US and our European allies and partners that we stand firmly with Ukraine in support of its sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" he said.

""We have been clear, if any Russian military forces move across Ukraine's border, that is a renewed invasion. It will be met with swift, severe and a united response from the United States and our partners and allies.""

The US secretary of state also warned of Russia's ""extensive playbook of aggression short of military action"", which he said includes ""cyberattacks, paramilitary tactics and other means of advancing their interests aggressively without using military action"".

""Those types of Russian aggression, will be met with a decisive, calibrated and again united response,"" Mr Blinken said.

He added: ""We didn't expect any major breakthroughs to happen today, but I believe we are now on a clearer path to understanding each other's positions.""

Analysis: Why Ukraine’s border tensions matter to us all Dominic Waghorn International Affairs Editor @DominicWaghorn A huge amount is at stake in these talks and the urgency increases with each failed round of negotiations. Vladimir Putin wants to wind the clock back to the mid-90s and has made explicit threats about military action if his demands are not met. If that means an invasion of Ukraine, numerous military figures predict violence in Europe on a scale not seen since the Second World War. His deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, last week warned of consequences for security across the entire continent of Europe if Putin's demands are not met. That means we could all feel the impact of diplomatic failure even though Ukraine is on the other side of Europe. There is little sign of progress in these talks. One Russian official this morning told Sky News the Americans are stubborn as hell. It does not sound like the deadlock has been broken. But they may have found enough to continue talking, perhaps at a presidential level next.

On Russia's repeated insistence that it has no plans to invade Ukraine, Mr Blinken said: ""We're looking at what is visible to all, and it is deeds and actions and not words that make all the difference.""

But he said talks would continue and that the US was open to a meeting between the Russian leader Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden, if it would be ""useful and productive"".

Mr Lavrov described the talks in Geneva as ""constructive and useful"" and said the US had agreed to provide written responses to Russian demands on Ukraine and NATO next week.

But he said: ""I can't say whether we are on the right path or not.

""We will see when we get the American responses.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:26 Russia and the West: What's going on?

Mr Lavrov also said he hoped ""emotions would cool down"" over Ukraine and repeated the claim that Russia posed no threat to its former Soviet neighbour.

Moscow has demanded that NATO promise Ukraine will never be allowed to join the military alliance.

It also wants the allies to remove troops and military equipment from parts of eastern Europe.

However, the US and its allies have rejected these demands and repeatedly promised ""severe"" consequences including tough economic sanctions - though not military action - against Russia if an invasion goes ahead.

It came as the US treasury department slapped new sanctions on four Ukrainian officials, accused of being at the centre of a Kremlin effort to damage Ukraine's ability to ""independently function"".

Russia seized control of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014 and backed a separatist insurgency in the eastern part of the country, that has claimed more than 14,000 lives.

Mr Putin has faced limited international consequences for those moves, but the West says a new invasion would be different.

Mr Blinken has also sought to stress US unity with its partners after US President Joe Biden drew widespread criticism for saying retaliation for Russian aggression in Ukraine would depend on the circumstances and that a ""minor incursion"" would see a lesser response.

Grant Shapps has pledged to launch a ""bonfire of the banalities"" to make rail journeys in England quieter.

The Department for Transport (DfT) said messages which ""add unnecessary noise and disruption to journeys"" will be cut in the coming months.

Announcements which face the axe include those which are ""banal"" or ""contradictory"", such as reminding passengers to have their tickets ready when leaving a station or to keep volume levels on electronic devices low while on-board messages ""blare out"".

📢 '...put unwanted newspapers in the bin...'



This is one example of the announcements that we're getting rid of, making the passenger experience better and delivering on the Williams-Shapps #PlanForRail.

The DfT stated it will work with rail firms and passenger groups to identify which announcements can be axed.

Mr Shapps said: ""…I'm calling for a bonfire of the banalities to bring down the number of announcements passengers are forced to sit through and make their journey that little bit more peaceful.""

However, a rail industry source told the PA news agency the Government does not control what announcements are made, and it would be ""crazy for it to intervene at that level"".

Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: ""We know people want the most relevant and timely messages on their journeys and to help with this, train operators are continuing their work to improve customer information, including cutting unnecessary onboard announcements.""

'Nothing but a PR stunt by this collapsing Government'

Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT), said: ""No one ever complained about receiving too much information about rail services, and this is clearly nothing but a PR stunt by this collapsing Government.""

Clive Wood, lead regional policy and campaigns manager at charity Guide Dogs, said the proposal would cause problems for the visually impaired.

And Labour's shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: ""Tannoys aren't the only thing that have fallen silent.

""Ministers have literally nothing to say about the Conservatives' cost of living crisis facing passengers as they hike up rail fares this year and services are cut.

""What hard-pressed passengers want to hear more than anything else is a plan to help them.""

On Thursday, US President Joe Biden warned that ""Russia will pay a heavy price"" if it invades Ukraine, while Russia announced naval drills in several parts of the world and claimed the West is plotting ""provocations"" in Ukraine.

In an attempt to ease tensions, the top diplomats from Washington and the Kremlin are set for crunch talks in Geneva.

What does America want from the talks?

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is preparing to meet his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, however the former indicated that talks will likely fail.

Ahead of the meeting, Mr Blinken said on Thursday: ""These are difficult issues we are facing and resolving them won't happen quickly.""

America wants one thing above all.

To get this settled without a Russian invasion of Ukraine so Washington can move attention eastwards. Joe Biden sees China as a much bigger threat and challenge than Russia and wants to focus attention in that direction.

Image: US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken (left), and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will hold talks in Geneva on Friday

Barack Obama felt the same, wanting a pivot to the east, but events have a way of interfering in international affairs and the middle east and Syria especially kept sucking his attention back in.

Mr Biden wants to avoid the same with Ukraine and Russia.

But President Biden knows the two are linked, that missteps over Ukraine will complicate matters over China.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is watching intently.

If Russia can ride roughshod over the West in Ukraine, the Chinese may be emboldened over Taiwan, which Xi Jinping wants absorbed into the Chinese mainland.

Image: The United Kingdom has sent defensive weapons to Ukraine

So the Biden administration has worked hard to deter Russia, assiduously trying to build unity and resolve among its allies on sanctions it hopes will be enough to avert invasion.

A carrot and stick approach

The sanctions are largely financial and economic but critics say that is like bringing a knife to a gunfight.

Washington hopes the carrot and stick approach will be effective.

The stick being the threat of sanctions, the carrot talks on issues Russia wants aired.

America is prepared to talk about transparency, better communication between NATO and Russia, arms reductions, military exercises and missile deployment, hoping that will assuage Russian fears about NATO's inexorable expansion to the east.

Image: The US has warned the Kremlin it will face 'heavy' sanctions if it invades Ukraine

On the face of it that is not nearly enough to meet Russia's demands for sweeping security guarantees.

But US negotiators hope there is enough to chew on while more and more military materiel is sent to Ukraine and while the window for invasion passes.

Come mid-February some military experts say the ground will be too soft for the movement of Russian heavy armour.

The Russians want to see written responses to their demands.

What does Russia want from the talks?

Today's high-level meeting in Geneva is unlikely to yield any major breakthroughs but at least the sides are still talking.

Russia's core demand, that NATO's open door policy be shut once and for all and that any promise of future membership for Ukraine and Georgia be revoked is the one issue where NATO has made clear it won't budge.

The more Russia threatens, the more likely it is that Russia's other core grievance, the provision of Western military support to Ukraine, will intensify further. That is a considerable diplomatic impasse.

Whatever might be said on other issues of strategic security, the US missile defence systems in Poland and Romania for example which are long-standing grievances for Russia, are secondary and were under discussion before Russia started its troop build-up. Concessions there are unlikely to cut through.

Image: President Joe Biden

NATO's promise of possible future accession to Ukraine and Georgia is in any case entirely academic. It will not happen anytime soon and both sides know that. Perhaps, if appeasement of sorts is a strategy the US will countenance, it is best to say that out loud.

The Russian stance that this is a complete package, take it or leave it, is a maximalist position and in any case Russia's foreign ministry has said it wants written responses to each proposal, (which Mr Blinken has already said he will not be giving), which would suggest they will consider the issues separately.

The question is: What is Vladimir Putin's ultimate goal? Even his own diplomats may not know. Will he be content with concessions around the edges of his security guarantee proposals or is diplomacy a side-bar in an inevitable slide to conflict? Is his prize to squeeze concessions from NATO, to downgrade Ukraine's defensive capabilities (which he could do with missile attacks without even sending troops across the border) or is it about Russia's place in the world - reasserting a Russian sphere of influence and ensuring Ukraine remains a buffer between Russia and the West? Or is it a more emotional pitch where Ukraine itself is the prize, wrenched as he sees it from the Motherland after the collapse of the Soviet Union?

Mr Putin may not be on some grand imperialist campaign but he does feel the loss of great power status keenly and he does believe in spheres of influence. Even now, with Europe on high alert, he has the whole world talking about him.

The US President's incursion vs invasion slip is perhaps of relatively little consequence. Russia knows Europe is not united on its response, especially when it comes to hybrid warfare tactics which don't involve actual military invasion. Russia has also never been swayed by the punishment, it has workshopped all possible sanctions scenarios and they have not deterred it before; it is swayed by the prize. The prize that only Mr Putin knows. That's what makes diplomacy so hard.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121153351/https://news.sky.com/story/russia-ukraine-tensions-top-diplomats-from-us-and-russia-set-for-crunch-talks-in-geneva-but-what-do-both-countries-want-12521366;'ARTICLE-3: politics'

Kwasi Kwarteng extolled the benefits of office-based staff interacting directly as he called for a return to ""some degree of normality"".

The comments came after the government this week dropped working from home guidance that was reintroduced late last year to try to combat the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.

It resulted in city centres that were still recovering from earlier lockdowns again seeing reduced footfall during what is normally a key period for shopping and parties.

The measures were described by some as a ""lockdown by stealth"".

Mr Kwarteng's comments come after banks such as HSBC and Citigroup this week were among those leading the way in calling staff back to their desks in London.

Meanwhile, the UK boss of PwC said the accountancy firm was expecting a faster bounce back than the last time workers were encouraged to return following lockdowns.

The business secretary told LBC radio: ""We should get back to work.

""We've got to get back to some degree of normality.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:17 'We can go back to the normal UK of the last couple of thousand years'

""People working in the office do get benefits from working with colleagues, being able to interact directly with them and I want to get back to a sense that the pandemic is turning from a pandemic into an endemic.

""I think the sooner we get back to the pre-COVID world the better in terms of workplace practices.""

Mr Kwarteng also said he was trying to increase the number of people coming into work in Whitehall, with around 50% of his department back behind their desks.

Earlier, he told Sky News: ""I've said that people should start getting back to normal as soon as they can.""

However, ministers face some resistance from unions representing civil servants.

The public and commercial services (PCS) union has demanded consultation on any plans for a return to the workplace and maintains that ""given the ongoing threat from COVID... it is safer for staff to work from home where they can"".

HSBC has said staff would be welcome back in its offices as part of a hybrid approach while Standard Chartered has told staff its London headquarters will be open from Monday.

Citi's employees are ""expected to be in the office at least three days per week"", according to an internal memo seen by news agency Reuters.

Image: Mr Kwarteng called for a return to 'some degree of normality'

Kevin Ellis, chairman and senior partner at PwC UK, said: ""The number one question I'm being asked from our people is when can we get back to the office - they value time with colleagues, alongside the flexibility to work from home when helpful.

""After the last lockdown restrictions were lifted, it took us two months to get back to 80% capacity.

""We're expecting a faster bounce back now - people know the drill - and this is great news for small businesses and city centres that rely on office workers.""

Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the City of London Corporation, said that after Omicron ""cast a dark shadow over the Square Mile's recovery"", signs were now ""much more promising"".

Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin this week told Sky News that the lifting of COVID restrictions left him ""breakdancing round the living room"".

But he cautioned that warnings about COVID had ""put the frighteners on people"" and that ""having wound the public up… to too great an extent, it may be difficult to get back"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121153351/https://news.sky.com/story/we-should-get-back-to-work-declares-business-secretary-kwasi-kwarteng-12521630;'ARTICLE-5: politics'

'Not just his lover but his formal partner'

The wedding celebration was reportedly attended by members of Mexico's army, politicians, and the governor of Sinaloa.

Hernandez spoke to Sky News about her research in July last year and, when asked if El Chapo and Ms Coronel Aispuro were legally married, she replied: ""That's a very good question.

El Chapo and Ms Coronel Aispuro have 10-year-old twin daughters together.

The Saudi-led coalition is believed to be behind the offensive, having stepped up operations on areas held by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.

One of the targets where many people died was a prison run by the Houthi rebels near the northern city of Saada, according to the Red Cross.

Save the Children said detained migrants were held in the jail and were among those who died.

More airstrikes hit near Sanaa, Yemen's capital, which has been held by the Houthi rebels since late 2014.

He is from Chertsey, Surrey, and was visiting loved ones in the city.

Officers said they received several emergency calls at about 2am (local time) about multiple shots being fired from an apartment complex in the 3600 block of Buford Hwy in Brookhaven, a city near Atlanta.

As they checked the area, they were called about Dr Willson's shooting in a flat close by - the 3100 block of Clairmont Rd.

A new ""sub-lineage"" of Omicron coming along just as the government abandons all COVID restrictions.

But while BA.2 is definitely something to be keeping an eye on, it's not one to worry about too much based on what we know so far.

BA.2 has been circulating in the UK for some time at a low level compared to the dominant type of Omicron here (BA.1.)

In parts of India and the Philippines it is the major version of Omicron. In previous waves there have been big regional differences in what sub-lineage of a particular variant is more, or less dominant.

The reason it's been elevated to a ""variant under investigation"" is because of what's happening in Denmark.

COVID latest: Follow live updates from the UK and around the world

Yesterday, Danish officials announced the BA.2 sub-lineage now accounted for nearly 50% of cases in Denmark (up from just 20% at Christmas).

What's more the BA.1. version of Omicron, and the Delta variant are on their way down in the country. Denmark also finds itself in a spectacular surge in COVID-19 cases.

It's good evidence, though not proof, that the BA.2 might be more infectious than BA.1.

The question scientists in Denmark are trying to answer is whether case numbers are surging there because of the BA.2 lineage or would have done whichever flavour of Omicron it might be.

Omicron 'sub-lineage' BA.2 designated as COVID variant under investigation, says UKHSA

The feeling among virologists is that BA.2 can't be that much more infectious than BA.1 because if it was, we'd likely have seen it rapidly replace BA.1 in places like the UK. Yet we've seen a very small number of cases.

For that reason it's unlikely to lead to a significant new wave of cases here - the difference between Omicron BA.1. and BA.2 is nothing like the difference between Delta and Omicron.

Another reason we shouldn't be too concerned is that evidence from Denmark and India shows no evidence of increased severity of illness with BA.2 compared to BA.1. And while BA.1 is genetically different from BA.2, it is not anticipated it will be much better at avoiding antibodies from vaccines or previous infections.

The worst that might happen is BA.2 gradually replaces BA.1 in the UK and makes downward slope of our Omicron wave that little bit longer. But if COVID-19 has taught us anything it's to assume nothing and wait for the evidence. So watch this space.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121164123/https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-the-omicron-sub-lineage-appears-to-be-mild-but-the-pandemic-has-taught-us-to-assume-nothing-12521918;'ARTICLE-5: health'

But how did a man named after a minced-meat dish become one of the most recognisable and significant musical and cultural figures in the world?

Sky News analysis of the data behind his career shows why his status as an icon will live on when the night is over, when the morning comes and for years to come.

He sold more than 100 million records during his 54-year career, and his first Bat Out Of Hell album, released in 1977, spent more than 10 years in the Official Albums Charts.

That places him ninth on the all-time list and fourth, behind only Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and Oasis, if you exclude greatest hits albums.

I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That), spent seven weeks at number one in the UK in 1993 and also topped charts in a further 27 countries.

The album version of the song lasts more than 12 minutes - longer than Taylor Swift's recent record-breaker All Too Well (Ten Minute Version). It has been played more than 21 million times on Spotify.

The 'short' version, at 5:29, has been played more than 120 million times.

But as with so many of the biggest cultural icons, he wasn't restricted to music.

He also has 108 acting credits to his name, including the Oscar-nominated Fight Club, The Rocky Horror Picture Show and the 1997 Spice Girls film, Spice World.

Fellow music-and-acting crossover star Will Smith has just 74 credits, while despite limiting their careers to film alone, Leonardo Di Caprio and Meryl Streep have 46 and 94 respectively, according to IMDb.

Robert De Niro has slightly more - with 125 - but beating two out of three of the biggest names in Hollywood history ain't bad.

And his fame didn't end with the age of social media. There are 26 million Google results for a meme in which people suggested what he wouldn't do for love.

He clearly embraced this newfound notoriety among younger fans.

My friend interviewed Meat Loaf about ten years ago and he graciously signed a printed-out meme for me. A king. pic.twitter.com/ZmvRSxuViU — Caitlin Welsh (@Caitlin_Welsh) January 21, 2022

At Meat Loaf's peak it could be said that wherever you were and wherever you went, there was always gonna be someone with his face emblazoned on a T-shirt.

There are now more than 500 active listings for Meat Loaf memorabilia on Amazon and eBay.

One of the products Meat lent his name to was Veg, as part of a vegan food campaign by Frankie & Benny's.

He didn't take on the restaurant's suggestion of a rebrand to Veg Loaf, but was a vegetarian for 11 years as part of a diet that saw him lose 5st (32kg), from his 19st (120kg) peak.

Like a bat out of hell, Meat Loaf the man may be gone, gone, gone - but his legacy is far from over.

Ben Howlett, MP for Bath from 2015-2017, revealed the incident following senior Tory William Wragg telling the Commons he has been told of claims MPs who want Boris Johnson ousted have been intimidated and even blackmailed by the whips.

Mr Howlett told Sky News: ""I was campaigning as a marginal constituency MP for a project, it was a link road and people remember that in my constituency I was trying to get government funding for it and of course during the Brexit rebellions.

""The whipping operation involved me being told by a whip that if I ended up rebelling and continuing to rebel then I would lose out funding for that particular scheme, which was frankly outrageous at the time.""

He claimed the road would have reduced pollution and congestion in central Bath, where some areas have nitrogen dioxide levels above safe limits.

Underhand tactics from whips 'been going on for years'

Mr Howlett said he was a new MP at the time but had the support of some senior Tories which meant he received some helpful advice on how to deal with threats from whips.

He added: ""The advice I received at the time is 'nonsense, whips can't do that' and I was very good friends with the transport minister at the time so I could easily speak to the transport minister and say 'look this is what has happened' and of course, they allayed any fears.""

The former MP said those types of tactics ""have been going on for years"" so he is ""surprised"" the government is dismissing claims from current MPs about blackmail and intimidation.

What do whips do? Each party appoints MPs, who must be party loyalists, to help organise and guide parliamentary business - these are the whips. The term ""whip"" comes from hunting etymology where a ""whipper-in"" whips the hounds to keep them from straying from the pack. One of their responsibilities is to make sure the maximum number of their MPs vote, and vote the way their party wants to get government business through parliament. They are charged with promoting the leadership's agenda, not the backbenchers', and are a go-between for the two. How whips encourage MPs to vote the way the government wants is often secretive, but can involve them offering time off, promises of promotion, trips abroad and even a better - or worse - office. The whip can be removed from all of a party's MPs so they have a free vote. A three-line whip, where a vote on a weekly email is underlined three times, means an MP has to attend and vote the way the government wants. MPs can have the whip withdrawn, which means they are expelled from the party so remain an MP but are independent as they are no longer expected to follow the whip.

MPs considering releasing damning recording of chief whip

A group of 2019 intake Conservative MPs are reportedly thinking about releasing text messages and even a recording with the chief whip making threats.

One of the MPs told the Times: ""They pulled me over and I told them I was voting against them.

""They got right up in my face. They told me that if you think you're getting a single f***ing penny, forget it. If you think a minister is coming to your patch forget it. You're done.""

Mr Howlett said the evidence ""will end up coming out"" but added: ""An ex-whip told me earlier on today the first rule of whipping is don't leave any evidence so it seems like they have left a cookie crumb trail.""

Christian Wakeford, the MP who defected from the Conservatives to Labour this week, claimed whips threatened to pull funding for a school in his area if he did not vote with the government on free school meals during COVID.

Some Conservative MPs have expressed their surprise that whips would threaten MPs.

Fay Jones, an MP first elected in 2019, told Sky News the threat Mr Howlett claimed to have had ""isn't an experience I've been through"".

She told Sky News: ""The whips have been extremely fair to deal with, easy to deal with.

""Their job is to get government business through but some of the reports that have been made and the allegations, they really just don't ring true with me so I'm a bit confused to be honest.""

Isotonitazene, a synethic opioid that is used instead of or in addition to heroin, has been linked to 25 deaths and seven overdoses up to September 2021, the Home Office has said.

And the Home Secretary has asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) for advice on the appropriate classification of Isotonitazene under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

Priti Patel also wants advice on two other substances - CUMYL-PeGACLONE, a synthetic cannabinoid, and Diphenidine, which can have ketamine-like effects.

The three substances are currently covered by the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, which means that supply, but not possession, is unlawful.

She said: ""Reports of fatal overdoses linked to this dangerous substance have been deeply disturbing, and I want to act now to ensure no further lives are lost or families torn apart.

""I'm determined to end the misery and destruction caused by the misuse of drugs and will consider the ACMD's expert advice on tightening restrictions on this dangerous substance.""

In October last year, the National Crime Agency said it was targeting drug networks that mix Isotonitazene into batches of heroin brought to Britain from Afghanistan.

It came after Public Health England issued a patient safety alert in August, warning of an ""unprecedented"" number of overdoses potentially caused by heroin mixed with Isotonitazene.

In the US, more than 100,000 Americans died in a single year from drug overdoses, experts estimated.

Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the Kurdish northeast of the country are battling to regain control of the jail after a car bomb exploded outside the walls on Thursday, setting off a major riot inside.

US forces in the country are helping to track down IS hideouts nearby using attack helicopters and air surveillance.

Among those killed were 20 soldiers and five civilians. Foreign fighters reportedly died too.

SDF commander Siamand Ali told Sky News: ""Dozens of IS fighters launched an attack on the prison.

""They used a suicide car bomb which exploded at the front entrance of the prison. There was heavy fighting between prison security forces and IS fighters trying to enter the prison and from the surrounding area.

""Counter terrorism forces and SDF managed to kill 25 IS fighters who launched the attack on the prison and more than 80 IS prisoners were arrested.""

Gunfire could still be heard almost 24 hours after the initial attack took place, he added.

Officially, local authorities have denied that any IS fighters have escaped, but the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has said its sources believe ""dozens"" have fled.

Sky sources in northeast Syria have reported dozens of families leaving the surrounding area, frightened they will be caught up in the fighting or used as human shields by IS fugitives.

There are also reports that a college campus near the prison has been seized by Islamic State.

The jail holds around three-and-a-half thousand IS prisoners and is one of many in the region housing former members of the group.

Prisons overcrowded and inadequate

Kurdish forces have pleaded to the international community for help in securing the facilities but little assistance has been forthcoming, leaving the prisons in a precarious position.

Many are overcrowded and inadequate for holding violent terrorists; sporadic riots break out but are usually quickly crushed.

Last year, a United Nations report estimated 10,000 Islamic State fighters were still free in Iraq and Syria and warned that the organisation is re-grouping.

Sleeping soldiers murdered in Iraq

Meanwhile, eleven Iraqi soldiers were killed in their sleep by Islamic State gunmen, security officials said.

The attack happened at 3am on Friday in al Azim district, eastern Iraq, officials told the AP news agency.

IS militants broke into the barracks and murdered the sleeping soldiers in what was one of the deadliest attacks on the Iraqi military in recent months.

Reinforcements were reportedly sent to the village but no further details were given and there was no comment from the Iraqi military.

Islamic State was largely defeated in Iraq in 2017 but the group's militants continue to attack security forces, and infrastructure such as power stations.

In October the Sunni extremist group raided a mostly Shia village in Diyala province, killing 11 civilians and injuring several others.

According to officials, the militants had been angry that their ransom demands for kidnapped villagers had not been met.

President Vladimir Putin and his officials insist they are just carrying out military exercises, but fears of an invasion have been mounting since late last year when satellite imagery showed Russia sending more equipment and personnel.

Here Sky News looks at what's happening on the Russian-Ukrainian border, why tensions are so high and what it means for the West.

What's the history between Russia and Ukraine?

Ukraine was part of the Russian empire for centuries before it became part of the USSR.

When the Soviet Union dissolved with the end of the Cold War in 1991, Ukraine became independent.

Although their shared history means the two are still very culturally linked, Ukraine has sought to distance itself from Russia in recent years and instead look to the West for support.

By contrast, Ukraine was a huge loss for Russia, as it had the biggest population of all the former Soviet states to break away from Moscow.

And with Vladimir Putin's rise to power, the Kremlin has sought to regain influence and control over its former territories.

This began with a more subtle approach in the early 2000s, but when his favoured candidate in the 2004 Ukrainian election Viktor Yanukovych was ousted for rigging the result amid ""Orange Revolution"" protests in Kyiv, things began to change.

Furious with the election of pro-Western opposition candidate Victor Yushchenko, Mr Putin's approach became more aggressive.

It culminated in Russia's illegal annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014.

Mr Yanukovych managed to gain power after five years of Mr Yushchenko in 2010 and served for four years.

But when the Kremlin-backed president rejected an association agreement with the EU in favour of bolstering relations with Moscow, there were huge protests and he was ousted.

Russia's response was to annexe Crimea and declare it independent from Ukraine.

It also sent troops into the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk - an area known as Donbas - to support separatists who had been trying to break away from the country.

Fighting in Donbas, which is near the Russian border, has resulted in the death of more than 14,000 people since 2014.

France and Germany spearheaded a peace agreement between the two sides in 2015, which helped end major conflicts, but it failed to unite the two sides politically and small-scale tensions have continued since then.

In early 2021 there had been increasing incidences of breaking the 2015 ceasefire, which fuelled fears of a war, but in April Moscow pulled back most of its troops and tensions lessened.

Where are troops stationed now?

Currently there are around 100,000 Russian troops stationed at various points along its 1,200-mile border with Ukraine.

Last week US intelligence officials claimed that Russia is planning to deploy as many as 175,000 troops in preparation for a potential invasion that could happen early this year.

Image: A map shows the numerous sites Russian troops are stationed at along the Ukrainian border

Most of Russia's military presence on the border is concentrated in the eastern breakaway provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk where its soldiers have been stationed in support of separatist rebels since 2014.

There has also been significant military presence to the north of Ukraine in areas such as Klintsy and Yelnya.

Satellite images from Yelnya, which also borders Belarus, in November 2021 showed Russia increasing its military presence, which has fuelled fears a war could break out, given its strategic location near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

Aerial imagery has also revealed Russian military activity in areas north east of the Ukrainian border.

In November battle groups were seen training in Pogonovo before forces were pictured stationed at Soloti in December.

Tens of thousands of troops are also still stationed inside the annexed territory of Crimea, with satellite images revealing significant Russian military deployments there in November last year.

Ukrainian officials have repeatedly expressed concerns about Russian presence on the border, while the Kremlin insists it is just military training.

What does Russia want?

After rising to power in 2000, Vladimir Putin has sought to maintain the Russian ""sphere of influence"" over its two neighbours and former Soviet states of Ukraine and Belarus.

Any attacks on either state are seen by the president as a direct attack on Russian sovereignty.

He is also fearful of Western involvement in either resulting in a new democracy being established on the doorstep of Russia, which has become increasingly autocratic during his rule.

As such Russia has issued a list of demands that would reduce Western influence in the region.

Image: Russian President Vladimir Putin

It includes a guarantee that Ukraine would never become a member of NATO, that the two end their security alliance, and that numbers of NATO troops in eastern Europe are reduced.

The US and other Western allies have described such demands as ""non-starters"" and completely unreasonable.

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has been taking part in crisis talks with Russian officials, including foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, this week in a bid de-escalate tensions.

So far the West has indicated it would be prepared to compromise on how it carries out military exercises within the region and the location of missiles.

What does Ukraine want?

Ukraine insists that Moscow cannot control whether it moves closer towards becoming a member of NATO or other Western alliances.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russia is trying to destabilise the country in a bid to oust him.

He says such a coup could come ahead of any potential military invasion.

Ukraine has also suffered a winter energy crisis after Russia imposed crippling sanctions on fuel imports.

How is the UK involved?

The UK has deployed 2,000 anti-tank missile launchers and 30 elite troops to help train the Ukrainian armed forces in the face of a potential fresh Russian invasion.

An RAF C-17 transport plane has been seen flying back and forth between the UK and Ukraine since Monday, according to flight-tracking software.

Image: A British military cargo C-17 plane unloads anti-tank weapons in Ukraine

The weapons and personnel are being deployed as part of Operation Orbital, the British training mission set up in Ukraine in 2015 following the annexation of Crimea.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has stressed that British military presence in Ukraine is only for ""early-stage training"" and ""self-defence"".

""They are not strategic weapons and pose no threat to Russia,"" he said this week.

""They are to use in self-defence and the UK personnel providing the early-stage training will return to the UK after completing it.""

Image: British troops provide support to Ukrainian forces in the Kherson region of Ukraine on Thursday

A spokesperson for the Russian-UK ambassador said however: ""It is crystal clear that UK shipment of lethal weapons to Ukraine will only fuel the crisis.""

How could it affect relations with the West?

A fully-fledged conflict between Russia and Ukraine would have extreme consequences for international relations.

It would deepen hostilities between Moscow and the US, the UK, NATO and other Western member states.

Speaking on a visit to Australia, Liz Truss said: ""An invasion will only lead to a terrible quagmire and loss of life, as we know from the Soviet-Afghan war and conflict in Chechnya.

""We need everyone to step up. Together with our allies, we will continue to stand with Ukraine and urge Russia to de-escalate and engage in meaningful discussions.

""What happens in eastern Europe matters for the world.""

In December NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg threatened Russia with economic sanctions and ""political restrictions"".

He described the risk of an imminent invasion as a ""defining moment for European security"" and expressed his continued support of ""deterrence, defence and combined dialogue"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121180958/https://news.sky.com/story/russia-ukraine-whats-happening-on-the-border-and-why-are-tensions-so-high-12521513;'ARTICLE-5: politics'

77;77;1464;1464;Migrant crisis: French police play cat and mouse with would-be stowaways hoping to make it to Britain;Friday 21 January 2022 19:32, UK;['adam parsons', '@adamparsons'];['migrant crisis'];['cat', 'waiting', 'play', 'migrants', 'french', 'hoping', 'henri', 'pull', 'lorries', 'lorry', 'migrant', 'men', 'stowaways', 'mouse', 'wouldbe', 'try', 'crisis', 'britain', 'day', 'drivers'];"It is the early hours of the morning, but this corner of Calais is busy, just as it always is.

At first, you don't notice many of the people. Sure, you see the blue flashing lights, the police vans speeding around and the articulated lorries driving in and out. But in the shadows and the gloom, there are hundreds of people milling around, all waiting to try to hitch a lift to Britain.

You see them as flashes of action. A lorry slows as it goes round a roundabout and suddenly there is a man sprinting alongside it. He reaches out his hands but can't quite pull himself up. The lorry speeds up again; the man slows up and walks away.

And so it happens again and again. Young men crouch in the shadows and then run out to try to pull themselves up on to a vehicle. Mostly they fail, and skulk away. Sometimes they pull themselves on, but are spotted by drivers, who come to an angry halt.

But occasionally they succeed. We watched one person, with a blend of audacity, agility and athleticism, run alongside a lorry, jump up and then pull himself into the space between cab and trailer.

It is extremely dangerous. Just recently, a teenager was killed after falling beneath the wheels of a lorry, the latest in a line of fatalities. But for the people who throng around this area, the risk is worth the potential reward. All these people are trying to get to Britain.

Image: Migrants put their lives at risk by trying to hop on the back of lorries travelling to the UK

Crossing the Channel in a boat involves paying a people smuggler, which can cost thousands of pounds, as well as the significant chance that the boat will be overloaded, sink, break down or simply not turn up.

Attempting to stow away on a lorry, by contrast, is free, and the supply of suitable transport is more predictable. The lorry parks of Calais are full of vehicles crossing the Channel every day. The challenge is firstly to get on board, and then to evade detection.

Neither is easy, which is why people often spend months on end attempting to get to Britain this way. And that's why, on this cold, dark night, the police are playing a cat and mouse game with all these migrants.

When a police van arrives in one place, the men go somewhere else and wait for the van to move on. No sooner has it left than the men return. It is a pattern that you see again and again.

Even when they are caught on the back of lorries, the police's powers to detain would-be stowaways are limited. Very rarely do even the most aggrieved of lorry drivers want to press charges. By and large, the drivers just want to get on with their journey.

So lorry drivers, migrants and police officers find themselves in an elaborate night-time choreography. A battle of wits and experience.

Image: French police spot migrants moving around at night as they attempt to hop on the back of lorries

Those running after the lorries are powered by hope, ambition and desperation. But for many of the police, it is weary work. Rarely do they speak to journalists but on this occasion, we strike up conversations with a group of officers from a unit of the CRS, the French force that specialises in controlling crowds and dealing with public disorder.

""It is like this every day,"" says Henri (that's not his real name), who's been coming to Calais for many years. ""Every day, every day. I've seen everything. In fact, I've seen everything twice.""

We are standing by the roadside, next to a hole in a security fence. He gently grabs my shoulder and points at a silhouette of a man in the distance. ""Look there. There he is. He's waiting for us to go. And as soon as we do, then he'll be back here.

""There is no reason for any of these people to be here except to try to get on to a lorry. It's the only thing they want to do.""

Image: One French officer said he doesn't believe the attempted crossings will ever stop

I ask if it's changing at all and he nods. ""Yes, for four or five months, it's been getting worse.""

What complicates his job is that none of these people even want to be in his country. ""They want to go to Britain, to become legal and then I think lots of these people want to go to America,"" he tells me. ""I talk to them. I even say 'what's wrong with France?' They say they think they are not welcome here. They all want to go to Britain - to England - and America.""

Migrant crossings: 2021 marks record year with more 28,000 people entering UK via English Channel

We spend some time with Henri and his team. They visit a lorry park, and find that a fence has been pulled down, even though it is topped with ferocious razor wire. The unit hunts for any people who might have got in, but can't see anyone. Either they've fled, or they're concealed inside a vehicle.

Further down the road, another apparently sturdy fence has been ripped open. Henri reckons it would cost two or three thousand euros to repair ""and it will be open again within a few days"".

Image: Migrants try and make it to the UK without the help of people smugglers by accessing lorries

They fire tear gas to disperse a group of men who are gathering alongside a road, waiting to jump on a vehicle. Later that evening, another group throws branches on to a motorway to try to slow lorries enough to give them the chance to leap aboard. Three police vans rush to the scene; the cat reacting to the mice.

It's not always about athletic endeavour, of course. Plenty of lorries have suffered smashed locks or torn sides, the signs of an unwanted visitor in a trailer. Drivers check their vehicles thoroughly, knowing they face a fine of up to £2,000 for every person they may inadvertently bring into Britain.

And even if a person does manage to avoid detection by the driver, a stowaway might well be caught by security checks at the port. Frankly, you have to be very lucky to get away with it, but some people do.

That's what inspires the ones left behind; the ones queuing up at the roundabout to take a run at the next passing lorry. ""I don't think it will ever stop,"" says Henri, as he prepares to go off shift. He'll be back tomorrow night, ready to face the same people, in the same place, doing the same thing.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121200804/https://news.sky.com/story/migrant-crisis-french-police-play-cat-and-mouse-with-would-be-stowaways-hoping-to-make-it-to-britain-12522006;'ARTICLE-7: politics'

Report reveals more details of parties on eve of Prince Philip's funeral

The first minister's criticism comes as more alleged details of two of the Number 10 parties under investigation were revealed.

According to the Daily Telegraph, staff in Downing Street partied until the early hours of the morning as part of a seven-hour drinking session the night before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral last April.

Downing Street has already apologised to Buckingham Palace over the two parties, one for departing communications director James Slack and the second to mark the exit of one of the PM's official photographers.

Mr Johnson was not present on the evening in question, but has said he ""deeply and bitterly"" regretted what went on as the Queen prepared to say goodbye to her husband of more than 70 years.

The Telegraph said it had seen a photo of staff at one of the parties, some of them clutching drinks, in the Downing Street basement.

The newspaper also said it had seen messages indicating that those present were still drinking at 1am, having started around 6pm the previous evening.

According to the Telegraph's latest report, wine and spirits with mixers were served in disposable plastic cups, with alcohol reportedly spilled on an office printer at one stage.

Staff ordered takeaway pizzas and some of those present are said to have used a slide belonging to Wilfred, Mr Johnson's son.

Previous reports have said Wilfred's swing was damaged as the two events spilled into the Downing Street garden.

Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said these latest details were ""disgusting"".

It is, however, more tense than usual as the fears of an invasion or even an incursion grow.

On the face of it, Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Trubachov seems fairly unfazed by it all as he guides me through their border positions.

He points towards a tower on a hill, set 50 metres back from the fence proper. He told me that they have cameras on the tower, allowing them to monitor movements 24 hours a day.

""If we see any threat of an armed attack on Ukrainian territory, our units will take up defensive positions in the trenches,"" he explained.

""We have special reserves prepared for this; also this territory is equipped with surveillance cameras so we will see early signs of an attack and can warn the armed forces, who will send defensive support.""

Few people come outside - especially not in winter

This part of the fence between the two countries runs alongside a village. Zvyazok is a sleepy, snow-covered hamlet that butts up against the border fence.



Few people come outside - especially not in the winter - but we could see the occasional bicycle, car, children's swings, and hear the ever-present sound of barking dogs alerted to strangers in town.



As we filmed in the village and walked towards the border fence, I was surprised to see a moving vehicle, and suddenly realised it was on the other side.

It was a Russian border patrol passing by.

The Ukrainians say they're doing the same job as them and they see them often. The difference now is that their proximity of just a few metres seems so much more poignant, given the rising tensions between the two sides.

People in Ukraine's second city are alarmed

Those deepened tensions extend to the regional capital, Kharkiv.

Ukraine's second largest city is home to over a million people and was, for a period, the country's capital, during the Soviet era.

People here were alarmed after President Volodymyr Zelensky warned in an interview that their city could be an early target if President Vladimir Putin decided to invade.

You wouldn't necessarily know it's a city on edge as they go about their lives, but that doesn't mean they're not scared.

Image: Victor Pichugin and Yulia Napolska have mixed views about the current tensions

Victor Pichugin and Yulia Napolska are young professionals who live and work in Kharkiv, their lives revolving around their home city. And although they say they're used to the cross-border tensions through eight years of war, it feels worse these days.

""It feels like we are on the edge of something really terrible, and scary, and so yes, I can say this, I'm scared,"" Victor told me after considering my question for a moment.

He also said he wasn't sure if he'd stay, but that he might attempt to leave. He doesn't want war, he told me Ukraine is a peaceful country.

Yulia has decided to train to be a battlefield medic. She told us she won't be able to sit by and do nothing if her city, her friends and family, end up needing help.

""You know Russians are living by war, by their imperial ambitions, but Ukrainians, I agree with Victor, we are a peaceful nation, but in case, if someone tries to take our freedom again, we will fight back.""

The truth is that nobody knows what a full-scale invasion would look like were it to happen.

And what's equally unknown is for how long the Ukrainian army would be able to resist.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121235945/https://news.sky.com/story/russia-ukraine-crisis-if-someone-tries-to-take-our-freedom-again-we-will-fight-back-ukrainians-say-as-tensions-continue-12522010;'ARTICLE-3 politics'

87;87;1479;1479;Highway Code revised: Cyclists given priority in new rules as drivers ordered to keep 1.5-metres distance when overtaking;Saturday 22 January 2022 02:08, UK;[];['highway code', 'cycling'];['given', 'highway', 'changes', 'cycling', 'looking', 'priority', 'overtaking', 'roads', 'distance', 'road', 'revised', 'cyclists', 'left', 'drivers', 'rules', 'ordered'];"A revised Highway Code comes into force this week that gives cyclists clear priority over drivers - with motorists given specific instructions on how much room to allow when overtaking.

The new list of advice and rules for people on Britain's roads will be updated from 29 January, pending parliamentary approval, and will introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.

But while the changes have been welcomed by cycling campaigners, the government has been accused of being ""far too silent"" in communicating them.

Drivers will have more responsibility to watch out for people cycling, walking or riding a horse - while cyclists will have more responsibility to be aware of pedestrians.

The new rules mean cars must leave at least 1.5 metres room when passing bicycles - and revised guidance also says ""it can be safer"" for cyclists to ride two abreast.

Cyclists are also now instructed to ride in the centre of the lane in slower moving traffic, ""on quiet roads or streets, moving over to the left if a faster vehicle comes up behind them, but only if they can do so safely"" and ""at the approach to junctions or where the road narrows, where it would be unsafe for drivers to overtake them"".

Other key amendments include drivers turning into a road being required to give way to pedestrians waiting to cross.

They are also now told not to cut across cyclists or horse riders going straight ahead when turning into or out of a junction or changing direction or lane, to avoid ""left hook"" collisions - and allow cyclists priority at roundabouts.

Another recommendation is for car users to reduce the risk of opening a door into the path of a cyclist by using the hand on the opposite side to the door, as that will often lead to them looking over their shoulder.

This is known as the Dutch Reach technique.

Provisional Department for Transport (DfT) figures show 4,290 pedestrians and 4,700 cyclists were killed or seriously injured in crashes on Britain's roads in the year to the end of June 2021.

But with just days before they come into force, a survey indicates one in three drivers are unaware of the major changes aimed at protecting cyclists and pedestrians.

One in 25 drivers have 'no intention' of looking at details of rule changes

A third of motorists (33%) polled for the AA said they did not know the Highway Code was being revamped, including 4% who had ""no intention"" of looking at the details.

More than 13,700 drivers were questioned between 8 and 18 January for the survey.

AA head of roads policy Jack Cousens said: ""While the government formally announced these changes last summer, they have been far too silent in promoting them.""

Duncan Dollimore, Cycling UK's head of campaigns, told Sky News: ""The changes to the Highway Code will happen overnight, so it is frustrating official communications come only after their introduction.

""That helps no one - neither the walkers and cyclists the rules are meant to protect, nor the drivers who are somehow meant to telepathically know about them.

""These are fundamental changes about the way we use our roads, it's essential we have a long-term well-funded public awareness campaign to make that change happen.""

A DfT spokesman insisted the changes ""were announced to national press"".

However, the department's website and social media accounts of the government's Think! road safety campaign have not yet mentioned the changes.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220122030712/http://news.sky.com/story/highway-code-revised-cyclists-given-priority-in-new-rules-as-drivers-ordered-to-keep-1-5-metres-distance-when-overtaking-12521747;'ARTICLE-7 politics'

Different to those who describe themselves vaccine hesitant, anti-vaxxers tend to employ aggressive methods to persuade others not to get injections designed to help prevent disease.

The list was compiled by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) and found most of the figures, who claim to be political or medical leaders, are based in America.

After social media companies were made aware of the prevalence of the material some was removed, but many videos and articles remain online today.

Critics believe some are exploiting loopholes which mean that if they post content under another name or appear on a page hosted by another user their anti-vax content is not removed.

Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the CCDH, told Sky News that social media giants ""bear none of the cost for the content"" they host, including dangerous material which can drive users to their platforms.

He called on the companies to do more to remove it quickly, amid fears that those left unvaccinated remained more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and, crucially, hospitalisation.

He said the most effective anti-vaxxers were ""great marketers"" and drew people in by generating content related to wellness or fertility, then gradually linked these issues to vaccination.

Mr Ahmed said the algorithms used by social media platforms then fed people more and more similar content, until they see it frequently while online - thus normalising the opinions.

""All the platforms care about is content that people will spend time on so they can serve them adverts at the same time… they are reluctant to take any credible action,"" he said.

Image: CCDH chief exec Imran Ahmed says social media platforms 'are reluctant to take any credible action'

Ed Stubbs, a teacher who developed a package of lessons designed to tackle vaccine hesitancy in schools, said that because young people spent so much time online they could easily find themselves watching a lot of anti-vax content.

He warned that fear over the COVID-19 vaccine programme had fed into fears about other vaccines administered to young people as a matter of course in schools and prompted growing general hesitancy to getting vaccinated for anything.

""Young people obviously look on social media, they see quite a lot of jokes on Instagram and Tik Tok, things like 'I got my vaccine and then this happened to me',"" he said.

""They are jokes and the students would even tell me and be laughing while they say them, but it still has an effect on them and instead of vaccines being something quite dull, boring, and necessary, it's something that is controversial, weird and slightly alarming.""

Mr Stubbs added that labelling people who are vaccine hesitant as anti-vaxxers can be dangerous, especially in schools, as it drives discussion underground and gives teachers less opportunity to open up conversations which could encourage uptake.

But he also warned that teachers must be prepared to be unequivocal about the benefits of getting vaccine and not sit on the fence, because they are in a position of trust.

Chris Philp, a minister in the department for digital, culture, media and sport, said the government would legislate for fines and other action to force social media companies to remove content deemed damaging but admitted that policing the internet was not an easy task.

""The internet is a large space and there is definitely more to do and we are determined to make sure that with social media firms, we take the action necessary,"" he said.

""There's always more to do. And in fact, in the coming months, we're going to be introducing a piece of legislation, the online safety bill, to go even further in imposing statutory legal duties on social media firms to make sure they act in this area.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220122030712/http://news.sky.com/story/two-thirds-of-anti-vax-propaganda-online-created-by-just-12-influencers-research-finds-12521910;'ARTICLE-8 health'

Roe v Wade was a landmark ruling made by the Supreme Court 49 years ago to the day and this march has taken place every year since, with the exception of 2021, when it was held virtually.

But this year's event has an expectant, even celebratory tone.

Those who have travelled to the capital from across America feel their fight has reached its apex and that the Supreme Court is on the verge of overturning the constitutional right to abortion.

The president of the March for Life, Jeanne Mancini, is the first to take the stage, pointing out where the first aid tents are in case the minus temperatures becomes too much, before asking the audience a question.

""Do you believe that the unborn person should have the right to life?"" she says, to cheers from the crowd of several thousand.

""Now say it louder so the guy in the White House hears you,"" she shouts and they oblige.

This is a minority but it's a significant and noisy one.

Ms Castro had earlier agreed with coalition partner the Honduras Saviour Party (PSH) that Mr Redondo would be elected for the position. However, around 20 rebel Libre Party members voted against Mr Redondo.

""A review of the notebook revealed written statements by Laundrie claiming responsibility for Ms Petito's death,"" the FBI's Denver Field Office said in a statement released Friday.

In their statement, the FBI added that both families have reached an agreement on how the couple's belongings will be distributed.

Laundrie, 23, was a person of interest in the killing of Ms Petito, who was reported missing on 11 September by her parents while the couple were on a road trip.

Ms Petito's body was found on 19 September at a campground near Grand Teton National Park in northwestern Wyoming.

A coroner determined she'd died about three weeks earlier of ""blunt-force injuries to the head and neck, with manual strangulation"".

The FBI did not release specific details of what was written in the notebook but said that they had also found texts between the couple, sent after Ms Petito's death.

""The timing and content of these messages are indicative of Mr Laundrie attempting to deceive law enforcement by giving the impression that Ms Petito was still alive,"" the statement said.

The films, which sees Cruise reprise the role of globe-trotting secret agent Ethan Hunt, has faced a difficult shoot due to the pandemic, suffering several delays.

Production for the seventh film started in Venice, Italy, in February 2020 but was halted due to the spread of coronavirus.

It was later moved to the UK but stopped twice due to the pandemic, most recently in June 2021 after positive COVID-19 tests among the cast and crew.

The latest instalment in the $3.5bn (£2.6bn) franchise was set for release in May 2022 but was moved again to the following September amid a spike in coronavirus cases in the US due to the Delta variant.

Cruise has previously hit out at people breaking COVID protocols on set and in December 2020, audio emerged of Cruise delivering a furious rant to the film's crew for breaking protocols, telling them: ""If I see you do it again, you're f****** gone.""
