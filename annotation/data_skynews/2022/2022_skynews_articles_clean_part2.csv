1099;1099;COVID-19: Credit Suisse chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio resigns nine months into role after bank probe finds he breached quarantine rules;Monday 17 January 2022 08:12, UK;[];['covid-19', 'banking'];['finds', 'hortaosorio', 'rules', 'credit', 'mr', 'resigns', 'quarantine', 'months', 'strategy', 'probe', 'suisse', 'announced', 'following', 'bank', 'role'];"Credit Suisse's chairman has resigned just nine months into the role after breaching COVID-19 quarantine rules - in fresh controversy for the global investment bank as it recovers from a string of scandals.

Antonio Horta-Osorio's departure was announced by the Switzerland-based lender on Monday in an abrupt move that comes less than a year after he was brought in to clean up the company's corporate culture.

It is now raising questions over the embattled lender's new strategy after its reputation had been marred by its involvement with collapsed investment firm Archegos and insolvent supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital.

Mr Horta-Osorio is the former chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group and had had previously been chief executive of Santander.

He has now come under the spotlight over reports he breached coronavirus quarantine rules twice in 2021.

In a statement posted on the bank's website, the 57-year-old Portuguese banker said: ""I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally.

""I therefore believe that my resignation is in the interest of the bank and its stakeholders at this crucial time. I wish my colleagues at Credit Suisse every success for the future.""

The bank said Mr Horta-Osorio resigned following an investigation commissioned by the board and announced it had appointed Axel P Lehmann as the bank's new chairman ""effective immediately"".

In December, it was reported that a preliminary internal bank investigation found that Mr Horta-Osorio attended the Wimbledon tennis finals in London in July without following Britain's quarantine rules.

He is also said to have flouted the rules on a visit to Switzerland in November by leaving the country during a 10-day quarantine period, according to the bank.

Last April, Mr Horta-Osorio stepped down as chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group following a 10-year tenure during which he stabilised the bank and oversaw its return to the private sector following its government bailout in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

Credit Suisse, which announced a new strategy in November in a bid to curb a freewheeling culture that has cost it billions, said the bank will continue to implement its new strategy with Mr Lehmann at the helm.

Mr Lehmann, 63, spent over a decade at rival UBS, where he was in charge of the Swiss personal and corporate banking unit of the bank after a nearly two-decade stint at Zurich Insurance Group.

Mr Horta-Osorio's sudden exit demoralised staff, with some questioning what was next for the bank.

Angela Glover, from Brighton, disappeared after an undersea volcano erupted near the South Pacific island on Saturday, sending large tsunami waves crashing across its shores.

The 50-year-old's family and friends had appealed for information on her whereabouts, with Facebook posts stating that Mrs Glover and her husband, James, went home to collect their dogs when the tsunami hit.

Ms Glover's brother Nick Eleini said the family is ""devastated"" that she has died and has asked for time for the family to grieve.

""I haven't got the words in my vocabulary to even describe how we're feeling at the moment"", he told Sky News.

""This is just a terrible shock that's happened to us. We're ordinary people stuff like this doesn't happen to people like us, but then, it does.""

Mr Eleini said his sister had been found during a search organised by her husband and that he had received confirmation during his journey back to the UK from Australia, where he now lives.

He said: ""Angela and James loved their life in Tonga and adored the Tongan people, in particular the Tongan love of family and the Tongan culture.""

Ms Glover had set up the charity TAWS - Tonga Animal Welfare Society - on the island and was a huge animal lover.

""The uglier the dog the more she loved it,"" her brother said.

Mr Eleini added: ""She was beautiful. She was absolutely a ray of sunshine. She would walk into a room and just lighten a room up.""

New Zealand and Australia have now been able to send military surveillance flights to Tonga to assess the damage.

UK wage data from hiring website Indeed shows that only a few jobs have experienced wage increases far higher than inflation since the start of the pandemic.

Those with the highest pay growth tend to be in roles that have experienced a surge in demand over the last two years.

Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Home care nurses, for example, experienced by far the largest increase in real wages of more than 50% between February 2020 and November 2021. Truck drivers and welders also saw rises of 18% or more.

But only a handful of jobs have had increases of this magnitude. In fact, many people have seen a decline in spending power since COVID-19 first hit, as prices have increased by more than their wages.

Fitters (people who install and service industrial machinery or do home repairs) have experienced the largest drop. Their real pay has fallen 14% since early 2020.

Quantity surveyors have also experienced a decline in spending power. Damian Fitzpatrick, who works in the industry, says this is a ""knock-on effect of the pandemic"", exacerbated by the rising cost of materials.

""The prices of materials and other things has gone through the roof so there's always the fear that buildings projects will be put on hold,"" he says, ""That drips down to people's jobs as there's less need for surveyors and construction managers.""

Mr Fitzpatrick is particularly conscious of the rising cost of living as he's about to have a child.

""Bills have gone up, food prices have gone up, prices in bars and restaurants have gone up,"" he says. ""If I have all these extra outgoings in the next year and the market might become unstable, that does play on your mind.""

In which sectors has spending power increased most?

Loading and stocking, which includes roles such as forklift driver and warehouse worker, experienced the largest increase in spending power, almost 9% since February 2020. Nursing and Construction also experienced real wage growth of more than 5%. But not everyone has seen their spending power increase.



Pay has stagnated for workers in Installation and maintenance and wages for people working in Administrative assistance, such as receptionists, are 1.7% lower than February 2020 on average.

Even in sectors with strong pay growth, it's not expected to last. Jack Kennedy, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, says that growth was caused by pandemic-related hiring squeezes.

""Since the reopening of the economy, a lot of sectors have been trying to hire similar types of workers,"" he says. ""So, we've seen candidate supply not keeping pace with resurgent demand and that's driven high pay growth in specific sectors.

""But we're not seeing any signs of any real gains for the average worker, which is concerning given the squeeze on energy bills and the general cost of living.""

So, what is the big picture?

In the UK, it has been an historically poor decade for real wage growth. In fact, the average UK worker is now worse off than they were before the financial crisis in early 2008. After plummeting at the start of the pandemic, real wage growth did bounce back in the second half of 2020.



But it has flatlined over the past year. If we now look at growth in real wages since 2010, you can see that the average public sector worker has lower spending power than they did 12 years ago. Real wages for the private sector have increased, but only by 5.6% since the start of 2010.



In the eight years before the financial crisis, only two-thirds of this time, private sector real wages increased more than 20%.

Peter Levell, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), says that the ""current crunch"" will be exacerbated by upcoming changes to taxes, benefits and the energy price cap in April.

""All of those are going to weigh on the cost of living of households in addition to the increase in inflation,"" he says. ""So, nominal wage growth would have to accelerate quite a bit to ensure that people's living standards for this year haven't fallen relative to the previous year.""

People without salaries, such as the elderly and people not in the labour market, are likely to be badly affected.

New IFS analysis shows that the planned changes will squeeze poorer households the most, as they spend a higher proportion of their income on energy bills.

""We think it's going to tilt the cost of living squeeze towards hitting lower income households harder,"" says Mr Levell.

The first minister said it was ""really exciting"" as it was announced 17 projects had been awarded contracts for the leasing of seabeds for the development of offshore schemes.

The nation's largest-ever auction of permits to construct offshore wind farms has seen final awards totalling £699.2m and includes contracts with Scottish Power, Shell, SSE and BP.

The ScotWind Leasing bidding process had received 74 applications from energy firms with most of the sites on the east, northeast or northern coastlines.

'Potential to create thousands of jobs'

Speaking to Ian King on Sky News, Ms Sturgeon said: ""It's really hard to overstate how significant and important today's announcement is for Scotland's energy, environmental and economic future.

""This gives us the potential to meet our own energy needs from renewable sources.

""It's going to position Scotland as a major exporter of green energy, green hydrogen as well - and delivers massive economic benefits as well as the revenues that will flow to the Scottish government.

Is the UK the Saudi Arabia of wind power?

""The estimate is that for every gigawatt of power generated from these projects in due course, there will be a billion pounds of investment in the supply chain and that has the potential to create thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of jobs.

""So, as we make this transition to net-zero to meet the climate emergency, this helps ensure Scotland can do that in a fair and a just way that creates new jobs to replace those in oil and gas, for example, which we are in the process of transitioning away from.

""This is perhaps one of the biggest, most significant days in terms of Scotland's energy and industrial future that we've had in a very, very long time. Really exciting.""

'Fantastic vote of confidence'

The developments - a combination of floating, fixed and mixed turbines - are estimated to produce almost 25,000 megawatts of energy.

Simon Hodge, the chief executive of Crown Estate Scotland, said: ""Today's results are a fantastic vote of confidence in Scotland's ability to transform our energy sector.

A team of around 20 historians, criminologists and data specialists have been using modern investigative techniques to look into the circumstances surrounding the betrayal of the teenager more than 75 years ago.

They believe a relatively unknown figure, Jewish notary Arnold van den Bergh, gave the Frank family up in order to save his own family, research team member Pieter van Twisk told the daily NRC newspaper.

Image: The house in Amsterdam where Anne Frank and her family went into hiding. Pic: The Travel Library/Shutterstock

Anne was discovered in a raid at the canal-side house in Amsterdam on 4 August 1944 after two years of hiding in some concealed rooms behind a bookcase.

Previous studies have claimed there was no conclusive evidence the young Jewish diarist and her family were betrayed.

Some theories claimed the raid which led to their detention may have been part of an investigation into illegal labour or falsified ration coupons.

Master database to uncover new leads

The new investigation team, which included retired FBI agent Vincent Pankoke, compiled a master database with lists of Nazi collaborators, informants, historic documents, police records and prior research to uncover new leads.

Dozens of suspects had been named in past decades, but never before had modern investigative techniques been applied so extensively to identify a suspect.

The attempt to identify the betrayer was not intended to lead to prosecution, but to solve one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in the Netherlands of the Second World War.

After Anne was discovered, her diary - which documented her time in hiding from 1942 to 1944 - was kept safe until it was published by her father, Otto, in 1947.

Anne, 15, and her elder sister Margot died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945.

The Norwegian mass killer has served 10 years of the 21-year sentence he was handed for a bomb and gun attack which also left dozens wounded.

The far-right terrorist, whose full name is Anders Behring Breivik, has shown no remorse over the massacre and even boasted about the scale of the outrage during his trial.

He raised his hand in a Nazi salute during his human rights case in 2016.

Families of victims and survivors fear he will grandstand his extreme views during the hearing, which experts say is unlikely to be successful.

Randi Rosenqvist, the psychologist who has assessed Breivik since he was handed Norway's maximum sentence for his crimes in 2012, said she has seen little evidence since his criminal trial that might impress the court.

""I can say that I do not detect great changes in Breivik's functioning,"" she said.

""In principle and practice someone seeking parole would have to show remorse, and to show that they understand why such acts cannot be repeated.""

Ms Rosenqvist will give evidence at his hearing and submit the psychiatric report, which is typically crucial if criminals are to demonstrate they are no longer dangerous.

Image: Norwegian special forces storm Utoya island before Breivik's arrest in 2011

Such an outcome is ""unlikely to happen"", according to Berit Johnsen, research professor at University College of Norwegian Correctional Service.

""I think it is quite obvious that there still is a high risk that he will commit new crimes if he is released,"" she said.

On 22 July 2011, after months of meticulous preparations, Breivik set off a car bomb outside the government headquarters in Oslo, killing eight people.

He then drove 24 miles (38km) to the island of Utoya, where he opened fire on the annual summer camp of the left-wing Labour Party's youth wing.

Sixty-nine people there were killed, most of them teenagers, before Breivik surrendered to police.

In 2012, Breivik was handed the maximum 21-year sentence with a clause - rarely used in the Norwegian justice system - that he can be held indefinitely if he is still considered a danger to society.

Irish police are still hunting for the killer of the 23-year-old primary school teacher, who was found dead after going for a run on the banks of the Grand Canal in Tullamore, Co Offaly, in the Republic of Ireland.

At the weekend, runners across Ireland and the UK stopped to remember Ms Murphy after her murder shocked both nations.

On Monday morning, Mr Givan, other members of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLAs) and MPs came together to pay tribute to the Co Offaly teacher in front of the parliament buildings at Stormont, Belfast.

Several senior politicians with Northern Ireland's main parties were in attendance at the vigil, including the deputy first minister, who is vice president of Sinn Fein, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood MP.

They gathered in front of a portrait of Ms Murphy and a bunch of flowers.

'We all must take personal responsibility'

Addressing the gathered MLAs and members of the UK parliament, Mr Givan said: ""All of us have come together in the past number of days to show our revulsion for what has happened to Ashling Murphy and to stand in support of Ashling and her family.

""We are struck by the last words Ashling said to her mum, 'Mam, I love you', before she left.

""As a father of three daughters I know last night when I was in Lisburn and we held a vigil, I was thinking about them.

""I was thinking about the type of society that they are growing up in, and when they get to that age they should feel safe, they [should] be respected, they should not be objectified.""

He added: ""They should not have to suffer the kind of bad behaviour which often is directed at women and girls.

""We all must take personal responsibility to change our society. Men need to step up and challenge this type of behaviour.""

Gender-based violence an 'epidemic'

Deputy First Minister Ms O'Neill also paid tribute to the murdered school teacher, saying domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is an epidemic.

She said: ""There are simply no words to convey the cruelty and injustice of what happened to Ashling, nor the heartbreak and sorrow of her loss. Our hearts go out to her family and all who loved her.

""Regretfully, the truth is violence against women and girls, the threat of violence against women and girls, the fear of violence against women and girls is all too common.

""Domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is an epidemic.""

Ms O'Neill added that anger across Ireland at the murder of Ms Murphy must ""now turn into determined action"".

SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon told those who had gathered that Ms Murphy's murder represented an attack on all women.

Campaigners are demanding that more be done to tackle domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence in Ireland in the wake of her murder.

Mary McDermott, chief executive officer at Safe Ireland, which campaigns for women's and children's safety, pointed out that the Republic of Ireland currently does not have a minister with full responsibility for gender-based and domestic violence.

""Refuge and support services are under (the department of) children and the rest of the responsibility, which we know requires a whole of government response, is scattered across the rest of government departments,"" Ms McDermott told RTE Morning Ireland.

Meanwhile, the Republic of Ireland's minister for justice, Helen McEntee, said over the weekend that a new government strategy to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence will be published by the start of March.

She said it would take a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to violence against women.

New leads being explored

Irish police have said they have identified a new person of interest - who is believed to be in hospital in the Dublin region receiving treatment - and are waiting to speak to him.

The Gardai believe the development of DNA profiles will form an integral part of the search for Ms Murphy's killer.

Officers are also investigating a complaint from another woman, who said she was followed on the same canal path hours before Ms Murphy's killing.

The teacher's funeral is due to place on Tuesday at St Brigid's Church, Mountbolus, in Co Offaly.

Schools and colleges across Ireland are being urged to observe a minute's silence at 11am by unions including the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, and Teachers' Union Ireland.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220117150728/http://news.sky.com/story/ashling-murphy-northern-irelands-first-minister-says-at-vigil-for-murdered-school-teacher-men-need-to-step-up-12518357;

Broadcaster RTL and producers ITV Studios say an independent investigation will be carried out into the claims which are being taken ""very seriously"".

Jeroen Rietbergen, a band leader and musician, has left the series, issuing a statement to Dutch media admitting having sexual contact with some women involved in the show and to sending sexual text messages.

He said he was not aware of wrongdoing at the time of the alleged incidents but had come to realise the women involved may have had a difference experience to him.

An allegation is also reported to have been made against rapper Ali B, a coach on the series (pictured on the show's Instagram page below, before the allegations were made public).

He has released a statement on his own Instagram page saying he is ""100%"" sure of his innocence and that he would co-operate with any potential investigation. His management team, SPEC, also posted a statement on Instagram saying the star has never abused his position.

The allegations were first reported by Dutch news show Boos, which is planning to air a special programme later this week.

In a statement sent to Sky News, a spokesperson for RTL said they had been made aware of allegations of ""sexually transgressive behaviour and abuse of power"" in relation to the show on 12 January, following the launch of the twelfth series earlier in the month.

The claims are ""very serious and shocking"" and were not previously known to the broadcaster, it said.

""On the basis of these allegations, producer ITV Studios Netherlands was contacted and following consultation, it was decided that ITV will immediately initiate an extensive, independent investigation,"" the statement said. ""The broadcasting of The Voice Of Holland is suspended for the time being, until there is more clarity.

""We take this very seriously. Everyone, including both participants and employees, must be able to work in complete safety. There is no room for interpretation here. The priority now is to get the facts straight.""

A spokesperson for ITV Studios said: ""We are shocked by these allegations. Our utmost priority is to provide a safe and supportive environment for everyone who takes part in or works on our shows and there is zero tolerance at ITV Studios for the type of behaviour alleged to have taken place.

""We have immediately commissioned an external investigation into the allegations.""

Reports over the weekend revealed plans - dubbed Operation Big Dog - are being drawn up to save Boris Johnson's premiership as he faces calls to resign over the Downing Street lockdown party scandal.

As well as sacking key staff, the plan focuses on major policy changes, including placing the Navy in charge of preventing small boats from crossing the Channel.

Downing Street is also looking to send migrants to countries such as Rwanda and Ghana for processing and resettlement to prevent migrants from making the perilous journey to the UK.

Navy plan 'a good idea'

Asked about the military plans, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News: ""It is a good idea that there is a single command and control, and that includes not just naval vessels but all other vessels, including Border Force, so that you actually have a co-ordinated operation in terms of the small boats.

""A really important idea is the legislation that Priti Patel has put through parliament to allow us to have a much better way of dealing with illegal migration because there are legal routes for migration, you know, I'm the son of immigrants.""

He said it would provide the co-ordination needed ""to go after the illegal smugglers who are putting these people's lives at risk"".

""The fault lies with the smugglers, these criminals, so you have to go after them,"" he said.

""The way you do it is a multi-pronged strategy, so you have got co-ordination on the Channel, you've got the Nationality and Borders Bill and implementing that properly and then you've got legal routes for migration.""

The Nationality and Borders Bill, which is making its way through the Lords, would make it a criminal offence to attempt to enter the UK without a visa.

It would also allow the government to remove a person's citizenship without telling them.

Rear admiral to have power to order surveillance or interception

Under the new Channel plans, the Times reported a rear admiral will have the power to direct Border Force, fisheries protection, the coastguard and customs and excise to carry out surveillance or intercept those crossing the Channel in small boats.

Previous plans to ""push back"" migrant vessels in the middle of the Channel are understood to have largely been abandoned over fears it could be illegal and dangerous.

Instead, the government wants to focus on making sure the dinghies cannot land in the UK illegally and under the radar.

By processing migrants in other countries, the government hopes it will deter people from making the crossing in the first place.

Last year, a record 28,391 migrants arrived in 1,020 boats but that number will likely be beaten this year, with nearly 500 crossing in the first two weeks of this year, despite sub-zero temperatures.

Raphael Chevelleau, 43, wounded three people and attempted to wound two others at the centre on 11 October 2019.

He was sentenced to a hospital order at Manchester Crown Court for three offences of wounding with intent and two offences of attempted wounding - after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing.

The court heard Chevelleau suffers from a schizophrenic illness which has been resistant to treatment.

He was admitted to hospital in 2006 for a psychiatric illness, while his mother said he was diagnosed in prison with schizophrenia when he was 21.

A consultant forensic psychiatrist had previously told the court he thought it was ""highly unlikely"" Chevelleau would have committed the offences if he had not been suffering from schizophrenia.

He said there was ""a wealth of evidence"" that - unknown to medical practitioners and family members - his mental state deteriorated ahead of the stabbings.

Manchester Crown Court heard how Chevelleau entered the Arndale and ""caused widespread fear and panic among the general public"" during the 2019 incident.

Nick Price, Head of the CPS Counter-Terrorism Division, said: ""This was a shocking and unprovoked attack and our thoughts remain with the victims and those directly affected by the actions of Chevelleau.

""I am pleased that he has taken responsibility for his actions through his guilty pleas and that the victims and other witnesses who have provided statements were not required to give evidence in court.

It comes as hundreds more daily services have been cancelled as train companies continue to introduce measures to deal with the ongoing spread of coronavirus.

As the Omicron variant spread across the country, it was estimated around 10% of rail staff were unable to go to work.

Around 4.4% of services across Britain were cancelled between 12 December and 8 January, according to Network Rail.

Only two other four-week periods have had poorer reliability since April 2014, analysis of industry data by the PA news agency found.

Most operators decided to introduce emergency timetables with fewer trains to increase reliability.

Avanti West Coast, c2c, East Midlands Railway and South Western Railway became the latest firms to adopt the measure on Monday, cutting hundreds more daily services.

Customers told to check for updates

Customers are being advised to check for updates before setting out on their journey, or sign up for automatic alerts from National Rail Alert Me.

The chief executive of the passenger watchdog Transport Focus, Anthony Smith, said: ""While the introduction of reduced timetables is a pragmatic response to help boost reliability, passengers have faced significant delays and disruption.

""Operators must continue to protect first and last services to meet the needs of those who have to travel.

""Passengers need punctual, reliable services and will want to see normal service resumed as soon as possible.""

Rail fares to rise by 3.8% in March in biggest increase since 2013

Provisional Department for Transport figures show demand for rail travel was at 55% of pre-pandemic levels early last week.

A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, said: ""During the Christmas period we focused on running as many trains as possible to get people to their loved ones, but this meant more short-notice cancellations as our staff, like those in other sectors, were being affected by the Omicron variant.

""The introduction of temporary timetables in recent weeks has ensured a more reliable service, with cancellations over the last seven days below average, ensuring our passengers have a service they can rely on.""

Andrew has been accused of ""victim blaming"" and ""gaslighting"" following the request, which includes confidential notes from her counselling sessions.

Ms Giuffre claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, Andrew's former friend, to have sex with the duke and is suing him in a US civil court.

Andrew - who was stripped of his military titles last week - has always vehemently denied the allegations.

The duke's legal team want to question Ms Giuffre's psychologist, Dr Judith Lightfoot, about her ""alleged emotional and psychological harm and damages"", including inspecting prescriptions and notes from their sessions.

They also want to quiz her on the ""theory of false memories"" and ask about Ms Giuffre's ""alleged childhood trauma and abuse"".

Ms Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, hit out at the request, telling the Daily Mail: ""This is exactly what [Ghislaine] Maxwell tried. It didn't end well. People may misremember a lot of things, but they don't misremember sexual abuse by a prince of England.

""In addition, Prince Andrew needs to say that all the other people who saw them together also have 'false memories'.""

A source close to the duke told Sky News his lawyers' request was legitimate.

""Ms Giuffre put her mental health at issue by suing for emotional distress damages,"" they said.

""The duke's legal team are perfectly entitled to test her claims, determine her damages, if any, and see what she told her therapist or not.""

A lawyer specialising in cases involving violence against women criticised the request.

Dr Charlotte Proudman, a barrister and Cambridge academic, said it appeared Andrew was trying to use Ms Giuffre's medical records to discredit her.

""It's nothing more than victim blaming and gaslighting,"" she told Sky News.

""Looking through her intimate, personal records when she would have told that person that information in the strictest confidence.

""For that to be used, manipulated and twisted against her is likely to be harmful and extremely damaging, and probably will be traumatising.

""It's another form of abuse but this time through the court process.""

Dr Proudman said she hoped that Ms Giuffre opposed the request. ""It's a really low tactic,"" she added. ""It's the lowest of the low.""

The latest turn in the case comes after a judge rejected the prince's attempt to get the lawsuit thrown out. A civil trial is now planned for later this year.

Why judge rejected Andrew's bid to have lawsuit thrown out

Ms Giuffre's lawyers have sought witness accounts from Andrew's former assistant, Robert Olney, and a woman called Shukri Walker, who claims to have seen the royal ""with a young girl"" in London's Tramp nightclub.

Ms Walker allegedly saw the royal ""with a young girl around the time that (Ms Giuffre) contends Prince Andrew abused her in London after visiting Tramp Nightclub"", court documents say.

Ghislaine Maxwell - who recruited girls for Jeffrey Epstein to abuse - will be sentenced at the end of June.

Eric Zemmour has been fined 10,000 euros (£8,350) and must pay several thousand euros in damages to anti-racism groups.

It's the third hate speech conviction for the ex-TV pundit, who is hoping to replace Emmanuel Macron in April off the back of anti-Islam and anti-immigration rhetoric.

Zemmour went on trial in November charged with ""public insult"" and ""incitement to hatred or violence"" against people due to national, ethnic, religious or racial origin.

The case centred on comments in September 2020 to broadcaster CNews about children who migrate to France without parents or a guardian.

He said: ""They're thieves, they're murderers, they're rapists. That's all they are. We must send them back. These people cost us money.""

Zemmour didn't withdraw his comments and insisted political debate should not be taking place in court. He also claimed prosecutors and anti-racism groups were trying to ""intimidate"" him.

It isn't the end of his legal troubles - on Thursday he will face an appeal trial on a charge of contesting crimes against humanity, which is illegal in France.

That follows a 2019 TV debate in which he argued that Marshal Philippe Petain, head of the collaborationist Vichy government during the Second World War, saved French Jews from the Holocaust.

Zemmour was acquitted last year, saying that his comments did negate Petain's role in the extermination, but that the court did not convicted him as he had spoken in the heat of the moment.

Lawyers plan to cite similar comments he's made recently as evidence in the appeal.

Zemmour's other convictions are for inciting racial hatred in 2010 after trying to justify discrimination against black and Arab people.

In 2016, he was convicted of inciting racial hatred over anti-Islam comments.

The world tennis number one arrived on a flight from Dubai a little after 12pm local time after being forced to leave the country as the Australian Open was getting under way in Melbourne.

There was no hero's welcome, however, as a small crowd, some carrying Serbian flags, waited for him outside the terminal at Nikola Tesla Airport, along with journalists.

""God bless you Novak,"" read one of the banners as he was whisked through passport control and customs.

His departure came after three judges in Australia upheld the government's cancellation of the Serb's visa and his deportation, capping a two-week drama over his decision not to be vaccinated against coronavirus.

French Open doubts

Even as he arrived home, doubts were raised over whether Djokovic would be able to play in the next scheduled Grand Slam, the French Open, starting in late May.

A new law banning unvaccinated people from sports venues, restaurants and other public places, will apply to the tournament in Paris, according to Christophe Castaner, a member of the country's parliament.

France's sports ministry said on Monday there will be no exceptions to the new restrictions.

""The rule is simple. The vaccine pass will be imposed, as soon as the law is promulgated, in establishments that were already subject to the health pass,"" the ministry said.

Novak Djokovic visa saga: How it all went wrong for the tennis superstar

""This will apply to everyone who is a spectator or a professional sportsperson. And this until further notice.

""Now, as far as Roland Garros is concerned, it's in May. The situation may change between now and then and we hope that it will be more favourable. So we'll see, but clearly there's no exemption.""

Beaten by Australia's courts and COVID rules

The judges upheld the visa cancellation on public interest grounds - meaning Djokovic could not defend his Australian Open title - a tournament he has won nine times.

In a statement following the court's decision, Djokovic said he was ""extremely disappointed with the ruling"" and he would be ""taking some time to rest and to recuperate"".

He added: ""I am uncomfortable that the focus of the past weeks has been on me and I hope that we can all now focus on the game and tournament I love.""

His visa was revoked for a second time on Friday after immigration minister Alex Hawke said the Serbian's presence in Australia posed a public health risk.

The minister argued that Djokovic risked whipping up anti-vaccination sentiment and causing civil unrest during Australia's worst outbreak of COVID since the pandemic began.

Following Sunday's hearing, Mr Hawke said he welcomed the ruling to uphold his decision to cancel Djokovic's visa ""in the public interest"".

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison also welcomed the federal court's ruling, saying the decision will help ""keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe"".

Djokovic had argued in an court that he should be allowed to stay and compete because a recent coronavirus infection meant he was exempt from strict vaccination rules.

1130;1130;BBC's funding model to be reviewed as Nadine Dorries confirms the licence fee will be frozen for two years;Monday 17 January 2022 17:08, UK;['sophie morris', '@itssophiemorris'];['nadine dorries', 'bbc'];['frozen', 'dorries', 'settlement', 'confirms', 'secretary', 'culture', 'bbcs', 'funding', 'told', 'reviewed', 'bbc', 'nadine', 'model', 'uk', 'fee', 'licence'];"The government will ""undertake a review"" of the BBC's funding model and the licence fee will be frozen for the next two years, the culture secretary has said.

Making the announcement in the Commons, Nadine Dorries said it is time to ask the question whether ""a mandatory licence fee is appropriate"" and confirmed a government review into the matter will start ""shortly"".

Ms Dorries told MPs it is ""time to look further into the future"" as we are now ""living in a world of streaming giants"".

On Sunday morning, the culture secretary tweeted: ""This licence fee announcement will be the last.""

Ms Dorries also confirmed the BBC licence fee will be frozen for the next two years and will rise in line with inflation for the four years after that.

It means the current £159 annual charge will remain in place until 2024 and equates to a severe real-terms cut in the corporation's funding.

In a statement, the BBC said the decision is ""disappointing"" and ""will necessitate tougher choices which will impact licence fee payers"".

Meanwhile, Labour said the plans are ""cultural vandalism"" and a ""distraction"" from Boris Johnson's ""disintegrating leadership"" amid the ongoing Downing Street 'partygate' scandal.

If the cost of the licence fee was not frozen and rose in line with inflation - currently at 5.1% - the total annual fee would be £167 from April.

Ms Dorries said the decision was being taken in light of Britons facing increasing living costs and that the new agreement gives the broadcaster certainty while protecting the public from the price hike.

""It's a fair settlement for licence fee payers across the UK,"" the culture secretary said.

But shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell was unconvinced by Ms Dorries' reasoning, telling the Commons the decision makes the government look like a ""tin-pot dictatorship"",

Ms Powell continued: ""Is the licence fee really at the heart of the cost-of-living crisis? Or is this really about their long-standing vendetta against the BBC?

""She (Ms Dorries) won't stop until her cultural vandalism has destroyed everything that is great about Britain.""

The plans for the new licence fee settlement cover a period of six years and will take effect from 1 April 2022 until 31 March 2028.

""The BBC wanted the fee to rise to over £180 by the end of this settlement, instead it will remain fixed at £159 until April 2024,"" she told the Commons.

""That's more money in the pockets of pensioners, the pockets of families who are struggling to make ends meet.

""We are supporting households at a time when they need that support the most and this settlement sends an important message about keeping costs down while also giving the BBC what it needs to deliver on its remit.""

BBC chairman Richard Sharp and director-general Tim Davie said in a statement that ""given the breadth of services we provide, the licence fee represents excellent value for money"".

""A freeze in the first two years of this settlement means the BBC will now have to absorb inflation. That is disappointing - not just for licence fee payers, but also for the cultural industries who rely on the BBC for the important work they do across the UK,"" their statement continued.

""The BBC's income for UK services is already 30% lower in real terms than it was 10 years ago. We will set out the implications of the settlement later, before the end of the financial year, but it will necessitate tougher choices which will impact licence fee payers.""

It concluded: ""The BBC is owned by the public and their voice must always be the loudest when it comes to determining the BBC's future.""

Ms Dorries told MPs that to help the BBC deal with the ""fast-changing broadcasting landscape"" the government ""will more than double the borrowing limit of the BBC's commercial arm to £750 million"".

""This will enable the BBC to access private finance as it pursues an ambitious commercial growth strategy, boosting investment in the creative economy across the UK,"" she said.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220117170751/http://news.sky.com/story/bbcs-funding-model-to-be-reviewed-as-nadine-dorries-confirms-the-licence-fee-will-be-frozen-for-two-years-12518533;

Scores of police officers in riot gear surrounded the building during an hours-long stand-off in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood in east Jerusalem.

The Salhiyeh family is one of dozens of Palestinian families in the area at risk of eviction.

Standing on the roof, Mahmoud Salhiyeh vowed not to leave what he said was his home.

He said: ""I will burn the house and everything in it, I will not leave here, from here to the grave, because there is no life, no dignity.

""I've been in battle with them for 25 years, they sent me settlers who offered to buy the house and I did not agree.""

Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank, in the 1967 war and annexed it.

The Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state.

Members of the Salhiyeh family say they purchased the property before 1967, while authorities have argued in court that the family does not have rights to it.

The Jerusalem Municipality formally seized the property in 2017 in order to build a special needs school, it said, but the Salhiyeh family continued to run a plant nursery there.

The family is waiting for a verdict on their appeal against a court's 2021 ruling in favour of the city but the judge did not freeze the eviction order.

Authorities and the police issued a joint statement saying the court ordered the family to vacate the property a year ago.

Hagit Ofran, a director of Israeli peace campaign group, Peace Now, said he sympathised with their plight.

""Why take out families from their home and not use another public land that you already confiscated in the past and gave it to settlers, this is discrimination.""

But Omer Barlev, the Israeli Cabinet minister in charge of police, said the government is in a no-win situation.

Inquiries were carried out after the Harry Potter author complained she had been the victim of ""doxing"" by ""activist actors"" who she said had shared photos outside her home, showing her address.

Doxing refers to someone making another person's personal information public with potential malicious intent.

Rowling, 56, has become a controversial figure and repeatedly made headlines for her comments on sex and gender issues, but vehemently denies allegations of transphobia.

Tweeting about the incident in November, she said she had been targeted for ""speaking up for women's sex-based rights"".

""My family's address was posted on Twitter by three activist actors who took pictures of themselves in front of our house, carefully positioning themselves to ensure that our address was visible,"" she said at the time.

The campaigners deleted the tweet the day after it was posted.

In a statement on Monday, a spokesperson for Police Scotland said ""no criminality has been established"" following inquiries.

Earlier this month, it emerged that Rowling's name had been dropped by a secondary school in Chelmsford, Essex, as a title for one of its houses, over her ""comments and viewpoints surrounding trans people"".

'People who menstruate'

The controversy surrounding Rowling began in June 2020, when she responded to an article headlined ""Creating a more equal post-COVID-19 world for people who menstruate"".

She tweeted: ""'People who menstruate.' I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?""

The author defended her comments, saying: ""If sex isn't real, there's no same-sex attraction.""

A few days after posting the tweet, she shared a lengthy essay about the issue on her website, detailing her reasons for speaking out on sex and gender issues - saying she was partly motivated because of her experience of domestic abuse and sexual assault.

""Trans rights are human rights and of course trans lives matter,"" she said in the post.

However, her views are considered gender-critical by some and she has drawn condemnation from some LGBTQ+ groups.

In an updated post on his Substack page, Dominic Cummings said he raised his concerns about the event in the Number 10 garden in May 2020 directly with the PM and would ""swear under oath this is what happened"".

""PM was told about the invite, he knew it was a drinks party, he lied to parliament,"" he wrote on Twitter, posting a link to the latest entry.

Mr Johnson's principal private secretary Martin Reynolds emailed officials with an invite to the event on 20 May, suggesting attendees ""BYOB"" (bring your own bottle, or booze).

The emergence of this email has provoked anger and led to calls, including from some Conservative MPs, for the PM to resign.

If it is established that Mr Johnson knew in advance about the party and lied to parliament in saying he believed it was a ""work event"", he would be in much greater danger of being forced out of office.

The 20 May event is the latest in a string of reported gatherings in Downing Street and other government departments during COVID restrictions in 2020 and 2021.

A second Downing Street source has told Sky News the PM was warned about the gathering before it took place.

They have told Sky's political editor Beth Rigby that, per Mr Cummings' blog post, Mr Reynolds was warned about the event after sending out the email invitation, and that Mr Johnson was also informed.

But Downing Street said earlier on Monday it was not true that Mr Johnson was warned about the gathering in advance and repeated the PM's assertion to MPs last week that he ""implicitly"" believed it was a work event.

Number 10 has repeated this denial in the wake of Mr Cummings' latest post.

Mr Cummings left Number 10 in November 2020 and has since been a persistent critic of Mr Johnson.

""MPs should focus on the basics,"" he wrote on his Substack.

""The PM's PPS [principal private secretary] invited people to a drinks party. The PPS was told to cancel the invite by at least two people.

""He checked with the PM whether the party should go ahead. The PM agreed it should.

""They both went to the party. It was actually a drinks party.

""The PM told MPs repeatedly that he had no idea about any parties.

Priti Patel also said ""protective security"" for the Jewish community in the UK is part of the response to the 10-hour armed stand-off in Colleyville, Texas, on Saturday night.

Malik Faisal Akram, originally from Blackburn in Lancashire, was shot dead after the FBI entered the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue.

The home secretary's remarks came after a rabbi told how he and the other three hostages managed to escape the building without a shot being fired.

All of the hostages were unharmed in the stand-off.

Sky News understands Akram arrived in the US via New York's JFK International Airport shortly before the New Year before buying the handgun he used in the siege.

She also told the House of Commons today: ""Just prior to questions this afternoon I had a bilateral call with my counterpart for homeland security in the US.

Ms Patel's call with Mr Mayorkas came after two men were arrested in south Manchester on Sunday following the stand-off.

Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the teenagers, whose ages and genders they did not immediately confirm, remain in custody for questioning.

GMP said police forces in the region are liaising with local communities to put in place any measures to provide further reassurance.

Akram's family have said they were ""absolutely devastated"" by what had happened and ""do not condone any of his actions"", according to a statement which had been shared on the Blackburn Muslim Community Facebook page.

The statement, attributed to Akram's brother Gulbar, who said he had been involved in the negotiating with his sibling from the UK during the siege, added that the hostage-taker ""was suffering from mental health issues"".

US President Joe Biden branded the incident ""an act of terror"".

In an update to reporters on Sunday, Mr Biden said while he did not have all the details it was believed Akram had ""got the weapons on the street"", adding: ""He purchased them when he landed.""

He said there were ""no bombs that we know of"", and that Akram is thought to have ""spent the first night in a homeless shelter"".

Akram is said to have demanded the release of Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, who was convicted of trying to kill US army officers in Afghanistan, and is in prison in Texas.

The Long-Range Acoustic Devices (LRAD) are already installed on two Border Force vessels but are used to issue voice commands. They were purchased by the Ministry of Defence for use as loud-speakers during the 2012 Olympic Games in London.

However, Downing Street policy experts called for them to be used as sound cannons which emit loud, high-frequency noise powerful enough to induce vomiting.

Currently used in the United States to disperse crowds and tested by the Greek government against migrants crossing the sea, their use is controversial.

The request was turned down by the Home Office after senior figures suggested the plan would not work.

It comes amid a growing blame game over a failure to stop people from crossing the Channel in small boats, despite repeated policy announcements and pledges to get a grip.

The Navy is set to take central command of the issue after the Home Office won the backing of the prime minister for the plan.

A Home Office source said the involvement of the Navy would protect against strike action proposed by Border Force staff, angry over plans to turn back small boats in the Channel.

The French government has said such a plan would be illegal and it would not accept migrants being returned to its water in this way.

Sky News has been told that the prime minister vented his frustration at Home Secretary Priti Patel in a meeting at the end of last year after nearly 30 people died in one crossing in late November.

A senior Home Office source said Ms Patel had been pushing for military involvement for some time and had been repeatedly blocked despite crossings increasing.

They added: ""Everyone is frustrated with the situation but the only person coming up with workable ideas is Priti. Nobody else has come up with anything useful and if other departments had pulled their weight earlier we wouldn't be in this situation now.""

Currently 'no plans' to use devices

A spokesperson for the department said there are currently ""no plans"" to use the sonic devices to deter migrants, but added: ""As part of our ongoing operational response and to prevent further loss of life at sea, we continue to test a range of safe and legal options to stop small boats making this dangerous and unnecessary journey.""

A Ministry of Defence source said research had been conducted jointly with the Home Office into use of LRAD's in the Channel but the plan had been rejected as it would not work.

LRAD devices are in use by the Ministry of Defence Police Marine Unit on the Clyde.

A Ministry of Defence spokesperson added: ""Unacceptable numbers of people continue to make the dangerous Channel crossings and last November's tragic deaths serve as the strongest reminder of the need to stop them.

""The government is exploring every avenue to prevent further crossings and details of how that can be achieved will be made known in due course.""

Researchers from the University of Exeter and the Met Office analysed worldwide policies and found that on the ""current trajectory"" the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is slipping out of reach.

Professor Richard Betts, who led the research, said the agreements made at COP26 in Glasgow ""have reduced the likelihood"" of warming reaching 4C ""but it remains possible"".

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 56:26 Climate Crisis: After COP26

The report, which informed the government's Third UK Climate Change Risk Assessment, concluded that climate change is already bringing substantial risks to Britain's natural environment, infrastructure, human health, communities and businesses.

The UK also faces concerns relating to security, migration and supply chains.

All of these risks would increase if warming reaches 2C - and even more so at 4C.

""Projections consistent with policies currently in place worldwide imply warming of between approximately 2C and 5C by the end of this century depending on the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and the response of the climate system to these emissions,"" the report states.

""This will further increase the shifts in weather patterns and extremes, further increasing risks to people and biodiversity, with higher warming leading to greater risks.

""Limiting warming to lower levels may still be achievable if global emissions are rapidly reduced to net zero or net negative, but even if global warming is successfully limited to between 1.5 and 2C, weather patterns will still be different to those in recent decades, and sea levels will continue to rise to some extent.""

The report calls for the UK to take more action to prepare for these impacts.

But this time around, MPs have returned to parliament in foul moods, having spent the weekend canvassing constituents over partygate.

They tell me they've been met with a wall of anger, irritation and even rage at Boris Johnson on the doorstep, which has in turn soured their own moods and made them question for how long the prime minister can carry on.

And on Monday night the accusation by Dominic Cummings, and backed up by a second source to me, that the PM was warned against holding the 20 May drinks event in the Downing Street garden, but carried on regardless, flies in the face of what he told parliament last week: that he didn't know that the garden party organised by Martin Reynolds was anything more than a ""work event"".

These allegations are backed up by journalist Dominic Lawson, who wrote in the Sunday Times that a former Downing Street official told him at least two people had told the PM it was ""a party"" and should be cancelled.

No 10 have denied the allegations, saying that this is all ""untrue"".

But the latest iteration of the partygate scandal will no doubt further rattle already furious MPs.

Andrew Bridgen, who last week announced he'd submitted a letter of no confidence in the PM, told Sky News on Monday night that if Sue Gray uncovers evidence that the PM was warned in advance, he's lied to parliament and has no option but to resign.

Mr Bridgen told me he'd received over 1,000 emails on the PM over recent days, with the vast majority calling for him to go.

He also believes a number of colleagues have letters ready - and are waiting on the Gray report to decide.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:36 PM 'thought it was a work event'

As for the mood as parliament returned on Monday, every single MP I spoke to - Johnson backers as well as foes - said they'd had a torrid weekend in their constituencies, and their inboxes were filling up with angry emails.

""My constituents are at the moment about 60 to 1 against the prime minister,"" said Wycombe MP Steve Baker on Monday.

Andrew Bowie, the former parliamentary aide to former prime minister Theresa May, told me he'd had ""hundreds"" of emails from angry constituents in recent days, and the public response was ""worrying"".

""[No 10] needs to know the level of anger in the country,"" he said. ""Something needs to change.""

But perhaps the most concerning conversation I had on Monday was with the new MP for Bolton North East Mark Logan, who has a majority of just 378.

Acknowledging the role Mr Johnson played in helping win that seat off Labour in 2019, he also raised doubts about whether the PM's position was now recoverable.

""He has a lot of convincing to do, because I, and my constituents are unconvinced at the moment,"" he told me, while stopping short of asking the PM to stand aside.

""If you can't turn things around with the constituents and you know, the British people don't give you a chance then you have to, at that point, reconsider.""

But with another serious set of allegations emerging tonight, the stakes are raised once more.

Allies of the prime minister were last week of the view that the Gray report would not find that Mr Johnson either authorised or organised any questionable events in No 10. That a sliver of an escape hatch for this seemingly cornered PM.

But now serious allegations have emerged contradicting the PM's versions of events and what he knew and when.

Large tsunami waves were sent crashing on to the shores of the archipelago, with two people reported missing on the main island of Tongatapu.

Angela Glover, from Brighton, disappeared and was swept away by the water - her body was later found during a search organised by her husband.

The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said there had been no contact from the Ha'apai group of islands and there was ""particular concern"" about two small low-lying islands - Fonoi and Mango, where an active distress beacon had been detected.

According to the government, 36 people live on Mango and 69 on Fonoi.

The uninhabited volcanic island of Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai all but disappeared following the blast, according to satellite images from around 12 hours later, as it was blanketed in clouds of volcanic ash.

The impact of the eruption was felt as far away as Fiji, New Zealand, the US, and Japan and two people drowned off a beach in northern Peru due to high waves caused by the tsunami.

Tonga diplomats have expressed concern about the risk of aid deliveries spreading COVID-19 to the island, which is currently virus-free.

Any aid sent to Tonga would need to be quarantined, and it was likely no foreign personnel would be allowed to disembark the aircraft, Tonga's deputy head of mission in Australia, Curtis Tu'ihalangingie said.

""We don't want to bring in another wave - a tsunami of COVID-19,"" he added.

International communication has been severely hampered by damage to an undersea cable, which could take more than a week to restore, and Australia and New Zealand were assisting with satellite calls.

Local telephone networks have been restored but ash is now posing a health concern as it contaminates drinking water.

The Ha'atafu Beach Resort, on the Hihifo peninsula, 21 km (13 miles) west of the capital Nuku'alofa, was ""completely wiped out"", the owners said on Facebook.

The family that manages the resort had run for their lives through the bush to escape the tsunami.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the weapons being supplied are ""short range"" and to use in ""self-defence"", adding that they are not ""strategic"" and ""pose no threat to Russia"".

Mr Wallace added that a ""small number"" of UK personnel will travel to Ukraine to provide training.

However, he said the UK will not offer the ""false hope"" of sending troops to the eastern European country if war does break out.

Mr Wallace said in the House of Commons: ""I have to be honest here, Russia has the biggest armed forces in Europe.

""Ukraine is not a member of NATO and I think it would be false hope to say that the British armed forces would be going unilaterally to Ukraine to join forces alongside Ukrainians in that environment, which is why we are putting all the effort in helping Ukraine help themselves, sanctions packages and diplomatic efforts.""

Mr Wallace made the announcement as he warned tens of thousands of Russian troops are positioned next to the Ukrainian border.

He added that the deployment is ""not routine"" and they are equipped with tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, rocket artillery and short-range ballistic missiles.

He told MPs there is ""real cause of concern"" over the scale of the force being assembled by the Kremlin, supported by Russian air and maritime forces.

Russia's presence and levels of readiness are contributing to a ""destabilising and coercive atmosphere that risks miscalculation at best and at worst conflict"", Mr Wallace added.

He invited his Russian counterpart, Sergey Shoygu, to visit London ""in the next few weeks"" to discuss ""issues related to mutual security concerns and engage constructively in good faith"".

After highlighting previous work as part of Operation Orbital, the UK's training mission in Ukraine, Mr Wallace outlined new support being provided.

He told the Commons: ""In light of the increasingly threatening behaviour from Russia and in addition to our current support, the UK is providing a new security assistance package to increase Ukraine's defensive capabilities.

""We have taken the decision to supply Ukraine with light anti-armour defensive weapons systems.

Image: Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, right, shakes hands with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in November 2021

""A small number of UK personnel will provide early-stage training for a short period of time, within the framework of Operation Orbital, before returning to the United Kingdom.

""This security assistance package complements the training capabilities Ukraine already has and those that are also being provided by the UK and other allies in Europe and the United States.

""Ukraine has every right to defend its borders and this new package of aid further enhances its ability to do so.

""Let me be clear: this support is for short-range and clearly defensive weapon capabilities; they are not strategic weapons and pose no threat to Russia; they are to use in self-defence.""

Mr Wallace reiterated there is a ""package of international sanctions ready to go"" should any ""destabilising action"" by Russia take place in Ukraine.

He noted any invasion will be viewed as an ""occupation"", adding: ""I fear it could lead to a huge loss of life on all sides.

""The current difficult relationship with the Kremlin is not the one we wish it to have with the United Kingdom, it does not have to be this way.""

Mr Wallace said when it comes to the UK's relationship with Russia, ""the current gap is wide but it is not unbridgeable"".

Mr Wallace added: ""We wish to be friends with the Russian people as we have been for hundreds of years. And there is a world in which we can establish a mutually beneficial relationship with Russia.

""I still remain hopeful that diplomacy will prevail. It is President Putin's choice whether to choose diplomacy and dialogue, or conflict and the consequences.""

Paul Shakespeare, now aged 66, was armed with a large sharpened stick when he grabbed his 18-year-old victim from a footpath and dragged her into bushes, where he attacked her.

He then threatened to find her and kill her if she ever told anyone what happened on the afternoon of 29 April 1990 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, a court heard.

The crime took place near to a children's play area on the Honeybourne line, a former railway line area popular with walkers and cyclists, Gloucester Crown Court was told.

'Don't say anything, be quick or I'll kill you'

Prosecutor Virginia Cornwall said Shakespeare had been seen staring at women near the play area before the assault.

She said this was a ""premeditated stranger rape when a weapon was used to gain the victim's submission"".

""The defendant had noticed the teenager alone and he had selected her for what was a premeditated assault,"" she said.

""She recalls the stick above his head as he spoke to her, 'Don't say anything, be quick or I'll kill you'.

""She became frightened and obeyed because she was scared.""

After the rape, he ""asked where she lived and where she worked and it seems she told him through fear"", she said.

""Before running off he told her, 'I know where you live and where you work and I'll come and find you. If you tell anyone I'll kill you',"" Ms Cornwall said.

Image: The stick, with a nail through it, had a pointed end

Shakespeare claimed the sex was consensual

Following the attack, the teenager approached a woman and told her what happened, which led to a police investigation.

Despite local and national coverage, the rapist was not caught - even after the victim took part in a Crimewatch reconstruction in 2008.

It was only last June that Shakespeare was arrested for possession of an offensive weapon and his DNA later matched the samples taken from the rape.

He initially claimed he had consensual sex with the teenager.

The victim, now in her 40s, told the court the rape led her to try and take her own life.

""I couldn't tell my family because of the shame I felt, I felt embarrassed, violated and dirty,"" she said.

""To this day my mum is not aware of what happened to me. Being raped will haunt me for the rest of my life.""

'I didn't know if I would live or die'

She said she was ""the most scared I have ever been"" on that day.

""I didn't know whether I would live or die - I was petrified.

""I am grateful he has finally admitted what he has done.

""I can only hope that he is remorseful, not only to me, but to his family for the pain he has caused for knowing that he is now a rapist.""

Shakespeare, of Upperby, Carlisle, in Cumbria, pleaded guilty to rape and possession of an offensive weapon at a previous hearing.

Some of Shakespeare's relatives 'unaware' of attack

His lawyer said he was suffering from epilepsy and was now using a wheelchair.

""There are family members who were unaware of his offending 30 years ago,"" Kim Whittlestone said.

""He has been married for 20 years. His wife works in the NHS as a nurse, and he has three adult children.

""All have to come to terms with what occurred, and he feels remorse and shame for that.""

Rabbi 'threw chair at captor'

The Rabbi taken hostage said managed to escape after throwing a chair at his captor.

Charlie Cytron-Walker told how he and the other three hostages managed to escape the building without a shot being fired after a 10-hour armed stand-off in Colleyville, Texas, on Saturday night.

Mr Cytron-Walker told CBS News: ""The last hour or so of the stand-off (Akram) wasn't getting what he wanted, he was getting... it didn't look good, it didn't sound good.

""We were terrified.

""When I saw an opportunity, where he wasn't in a good position, I made sure the two gentleman who were with me... were ready to go.

""I told them to go, I threw a chair at the gunman, I headed for the door, and all three of us were able to get out.""

One hostage was released six hours into the siege before Mr Cyton-Walker and the others were able to escape hours later.

All of the hostages were unharmed in the stand-off.

Arrived in the US before New Year

Sky News understands Akram arrived in the US via New York's JFK International Airport shortly before the New Year before buying the handgun he used in the siege.

Home Secretary Priti Patel has tweeted to say she has spoken with US Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and ""offered the full support and cooperation of the British police and security services"" after the ""deeply troubling incident"".

She also told the House of Commons today: ""Just prior to questions this afternoon I had a bilateral call with my counterpart for homeland security in the US.

In an update to reporters on Sunday, Mr Biden said while he did not have all the details it was believed Akram had ""got the weapons on the street"", adding: ""He purchased them when he landed.""

He said there were ""no bombs that we know of"", and that Akram is thought to have ""spent the first night in a homeless shelter"".

Akram is said to have demanded the release of Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, who was convicted of trying to kill US army officers in Afghanistan, and is in prison in Texas.

Speaking to reporters after the incident, FBI special agent in charge Matt DeSarno said they believed the man was ""singularly focused on one issue and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community"", and added they will continue to ""work to find motive"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220118000728/https://news.sky.com/story/texas-synagogue-siege-british-man-who-took-four-hostage-in-texas-was-on-call-with-his-children-when-he-was-shot-dead-12518516;
1155;1155;COVID-19: Loss of smell due to coronavirus could be down to genetics, scientists say;Monday 17 January 2022 23:10, UK;[];['covid-19', 'coronavirus'];['smell', 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'study', 'loss', 'sense', 'say', 'taste', 'infected', 'genetics', 'scientists', 'participants', 'genes', 'olfactory', 'reported'];"Scientists have said the reason some people lose their sense of smell after contracting COVID could be down to genetics.

Loss of smell was added to the UK government's official list of symptoms for COVID-19 in May 2020.

Some people who lost their sense of smell after testing positive for coronavirus have said it still hadn't returned six months after becoming infected.

The precise cause of this sensory loss related to coronavirus is not known, but scientists believe it is caused by damage to infected cells in part of the nose called the olfactory epithelium - which is found in the nasal cavity.

These cells protect olfactory neurons, which help humans smell.

A genetic locus, meaning the specific location of a gene on a chromosome, near two olfactory genes is associated with COVID-induced loss of smell and taste, according to a study published in the Nature Genetics journal.

This genetic risk factor increases the likelihood a person infected with COVID will experience a loss of smell or taste by 11%, the study says.

Vitamin A nasal drops to be trialled to help restore smell loss

Researchers at the genomics and biotechnology company 23andMe conducted the study as part of a larger COVID project, with 69,841 participants living in either the US or the UK.

The study doesn't reveal how many were from each country.

Of those who took part, 68% reported a loss of smell or taste as a symptom.

After comparing the genetic differences between those who lost their sense of smell and those who reported that they did not suffer this symptom, the study team found a region of the genome associated with this split that's situated near two genes, UGT2A1 and UGT2A2.

Both of these genes are expressed within tissue inside the nose involved in smell and play a role in metabolising odorants.

""It was this really beautiful example of science where, starting with a large body of activated research participants who have done this 23andMe test, we were able to very quickly gain some biological insights into this disease that would otherwise be very, very difficult to do,"" said Adam Auton, vice president of human genetics at 23andMe and the lead author of the study.

How UGT2A1 and UGT2A2 are involved in this process is unclear, though Mr Auton and his colleagues hypothesise the genes ""may play a role in the physiology of infected cells"" and the resulting impairment that leads to smell loss.

Trends also emerged among participants who reported the loss of smell and taste.

Women, for example, were 11% more likely than men to experience this. Meanwhile, adults between the ages of 26 and 35 made up 73% of this group.

The study team also found people of ""East Asian or African American ancestry were significantly less likely to report loss of smell or taste"".

Loss of smell and taste have been recognised as symptoms of coronavirus throughout the global pandemic.

Early research suggests loss of smell and taste is rarer with the Omicron variant, but not entirely unlikely.

In a study of 81 Omicron cases in Norway, 12 percent reported reduced smell and 23 reported reduced taste.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220118020755/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-loss-of-smell-due-to-coronavirus-could-be-down-to-genetics-scientists-say-12518727;

A plume of smoke can be seen rising from Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano in images taken before the eruption, with the volcanic island appearing to have all but disappeared afterwards.

Australia and New Zealand sent military surveillance flights to assess damage to the Pacific island nation on Monday after a towering ash cloud following Saturday's eruption prevented earlier flights.

UN humanitarian officials and Tonga's government have reported ""significant infrastructural damage around Tongatapu"", said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.

""There has been no contact from the Ha'apai Group of islands, and we are particularly concerned about two small low-lying islands - Mango and Fonoi - following surveillance flights confirming substantial property damage,"" Mr Dujarric said.

According to Tonga's government, 36 people live on Mango and 69 on Fonoi.

New Zealand's High Commission in Tonga also reported ""significant damage"" along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu, where there are several holiday resorts.

New Zealand's military has sent aid deliveries of drinking water and other supplies but these have been delayed by thick ash on an airport runway.

The country is also sending two navy ships that will leave on Tuesday and has pledged an initial one million New Zealand dollars (£498,000) towards recovery efforts.

The UN World Food Program is also exploring how to bring in relief supplies, though one complicating issue is that Tonga has managed to avoid outbreaks of COVID-19. New Zealand has said its military staff are vaccinated and willing to follow Tonga's protocols.

The government had been moved to act after the disruption caused by eco-activists such as Insulate Britain.

But the Lords rejected several of the proposed powers, including:

• Allowing police officers to stop and search anyone at a protest ""without suspicion"" for items used to prevent a person being moved, known as ""locking-on""

• Allowing people with a history of causing serious disruption to be banned by the courts from attending certain protests

• A proposal to make it an offence for a person to disrupt the operation of key national infrastructure, including airports and newspaper printers.

In a separate defeat, peers backed restricting the imposition of tougher sentences for blocking a highway to major routes and motorways rather than all roads.

Controversial curbs on demonstrations, including powers to impose conditions on protests judged to be too noisy, were also defeated.

Peers criticised the measures and their introduction at such a late stage of the bill's passage.

Labour frontbencher Lord Rosser said the ""sweeping, significant and further controversial powers"" had not been considered by the Commons, describing this as an ""outrageous way to legislate"".

He said: ""We cannot support any of these last-minute, rushed and ill-thought-through broad powers… with the exception of approving the increased sentences for wilfully obstructing motorways and major roads.""

Green Party peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb: ""These are draconian laws that are a wider assault on our democracy.""

Independent crossbencher and prominent QC Lord Carlile of Berriew, who previously served as independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said: ""The dilution of without-suspicion stop and search powers is a menacing and dangerous measure.""

But Home Office minister Baroness Williams of Trafford said: ""The rights to freedom of speech and assembly are a cornerstone of our democracy and this government will not shrink from defending them.

Image: Many of the proposals were controversial and have prompted protests

""But a responsible government, one that stands up for the rule of law, must also defend the rights and freedom of the law-abiding majority.

""Their rights cannot and must not be trampled on by a small minority of protesters, who believe they should not be answerable to the law and should be given carte blanche to cause any amount of disruption at any cost.""

Liberal Democrat Lord Paddick, who was a deputy assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan Police, said: ""If the government is determined to bring in these draconian, anti-democratic laws, reminiscent of Cold War eastern bloc police states, they should withdraw them now and introduce them as a separate bill to allow the democratically elected House time to properly consider them.""

He added: ""The anti-protest measures in the original bill were dreadful. These measures and the way they have been introduced are outrageous.""

But responding, Lady Williams responded: ""The arguments deployed here tonight are about the middle classes trying to stop working people from going to work and I know where I stand on this.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220118080714/http://news.sky.com/story/peers-vote-down-governments-attempt-to-control-protests-12518801;

The virus is leading to growing numbers of youngsters developing parosmia - a disorder where people experience strange and often unpleasant smell distortions, researchers found.

For those with the condition, chocolate can smell like petrol and lemon can smell like rotting cabbage.

Smell experts at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and Fifth Sense, a charity for people affected by smell and taste disorders, say children may be finding it particularly hard to eat foods they once loved.

Professor Carl Philpott, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said in many cases the condition is ""putting children off their food, and many may be finding it difficult to eat at all"".

""Parosmia is thought to be a product of having less smell receptors working which leads to only being able to pick up some of the components of a smell mixture,"" he said.

""We know that an estimated 250,000 adults in the UK have suffered parosmia as a result of a COVID infection.

""But in the last few months, particularly since COVID started sweeping through classrooms last September, we've become more and more aware that it's affecting children too.""

Fifth Sense chairman and founder Duncan Boak said the charity has heard from some parents whose children are suffering nutritional problems and have lost weight, but doctors have put this down to just fussy eating.

He said he is seeing teenage patients with parosmia for the first time in his career.

'He just stopped eating'

Malisse Kafi, 11, had coronavirus in September and has found it difficult to eat since then because everything tasted ""like poo and rotten eggs"", his mother said.

""He just stopped eating, food was making him retch and gag,"" Dawn Kafi said. ""It was horrendous.""

He was diagnosed with parosmia and given a nasal spray but it did not help.

He lost 2kg and was taken to hospital in November after he became dehydrated and started slurring his words.

The youngster needed to be fed via a tube through his nose and into his stomach.

Malisse still has the disorder but he has some safe foods that he can eat and is starting to get better.

Loss of smell due to coronavirus could be down to genetics

Advice for parents

Prof Philpott and Fifth Sense are launching guidance to help parents and healthcare professionals recognise the disorder.

Parents are advised to keep a diary of foods that are safe.

""There are lots of common triggers - for example cooking meat and onions or garlic and the smell of fresh coffee brewing,"" Prof Philpott said.

He added: ""Parents and healthcare professionals should encourage children to try different foods with less strong flavours such as pasta, bananas, or mild cheese - to see what they can cope with or enjoy.

""Vanilla or flavour-free protein and vitamin milkshakes can help children get the nutrients they need without the taste.

""And it may sound obvious, but children could use a soft nose clip or hold their nose while eating to help them block out the flavours.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220118080714/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-children-becoming-fussy-eaters-after-getting-coronavirus-experts-suggest-12518770;

Packages posted from overseas may have spread the Omicron variant to Beijing, Chinese state media has claimed.

The city detected its first locally transmitted case of the strain last week, just weeks before the Winter Olympics kick off on 4 February. A total of three cases have now been found.

The claims have prompted the State Post Bureau to order stronger measures to ventilate and disinfect sites where items from overseas are handled.

Postal workers must wear protective equipment, receive booster shots and undergo regular testing, it said on its website.



International packages must be isolated, cleaned and held for a waiting period to ensure they are free from the virus, it added.

The World Health Organisation says coronaviruses ""need a live animal or human host to multiply and survive and cannot multiply on the surface of food packages"".



Despite this, the Communist Party newspaper Global Times cited the Beijing Centre for Disease Control and virologists as linking recent infections to packages from abroad.

Mr Johnson is facing calls from within his own party for his resignation after it emerged several events took place during England's lockdowns in 2020 and 2021.

On Monday, Mr Johnson's former top adviser, Dominic Cummings, accused the PM of lying to parliament by saying he thought a May 2020 garden party was a work event as he claimed Mr Johnson gave it the go-ahead.

Mr Raab said he did not want to get ""drawn in to the soap opera"" of claims and repeated the line ministers have taken over the past two weeks that he will wait for Sue Gray's investigation into lockdown events at Downing Street and Whitehall to finish.

The justice secretary mentioned Sue Gray by name eight times during his interview with Kay Burley.

He added that it was ""ridiculous"" the May 2020 party was in honour of him for taking over as PM while Mr Johnson was in hospital, as has been claimed.

When is Sue Gray inquiry due to finish and what could it mean for the PM?

Mr Raab added that he felt ""as frustrated as anyone else"" by the multiple claims of parties while the rest of the country could not see friends and family.

Ms Murphy, 23, was found dead last Wednesday afternoon after going for a run on the banks of the Grand Canal in Tullamore, Co Offaly.

During her funeral mass at St Brigid's Church in the nearby village of Mountbolus, Bishop Tom Deenihan told mourners that Ms Murphy was ""a woman who lived the short years given to her to the full, who developed her talents, who reached out to others, who made a difference, who brought happiness and who was loved"".

He described the days following Ms Murphy's murder as ""a nightmare"", adding: ""A walk on a mild and sunny afternoon in January should be a happy event, promising the brighter and warmer days of spring and summer.

""That, as we know, was not the case.

""A depraved act of violence which deprived a kind, talented, loved and admired young woman of her life has since united the country in grief and support.""

Tens of thousands of people have attended vigils in Ireland and the UK but, while they have been remembering Ms Murphy, they have also called for more to be done to tackle violence against women and girls.

Bishop Tom Deenihan told mourners at the funeral mass that Ms Murphy's murder ""has questioned our attitudes and, particularly our attitudes towards women, and it has questioned our values and our morality"".

""Whether those questions will be addressed or passed over remains to be seen but we cannot allow such violence and disregard for both human life and bodily integrity take root in our time and culture.""

Father Michael Meade, who also addressed the mass, said Ms Murphy's parents, siblings, and boyfriend had ""been robbed of your most precious gift - a gift that gave only joy and love, fun and laughter to many beyond your family"".

Sky's senior Ireland correspondent David Blevins, who is in Mountbolus, said earlier: ""Ashling Murphy was one of those special people who touched many hearts,"" he said, adding that she had been a ""very popular"" primary school teacher, and a talented musician from a family well-known in the Irish traditional music community.

Pupils from Ms Murphy's class at Durrow National School formed a guard of honour and schools across Ireland observed a moment's silence at 11am.

Traditional Irish music was a theme of the service, which was also attended by Irish president Michael D Higgins, and Taoiseach Micheal Martin.

Anyone who saw a man dressed in a black tracksuit top with no hood, black tracksuit bottoms with a large white stripe or white writing on the side, and black runners walking around Tullamore should contact police.

An ECB spokesperson said: ""During the early hours of Monday morning, members of the England and Australia men's teams shared a drink in the team areas of the hotel in Hobart.

""The hotel management received a noise complaint by a hotel guest and, as is commonplace in Australia, the local police attended the scene.

""When asked to leave by hotel management and the Tasmanian police, the players and management in question left and returned to their respective hotel rooms. The England party have apologised for any inconvenience caused.

""The ECB will investigate further. Until such times, we will make no further comment.""

A statement from the local authorities said: ""Tasmania Police attended the Crowne Plaza Hobart on Monday morning after reports were made of intoxicated people in a function area.

Claims of a drinking culture

A midnight curfew has been in place on all England trips since a number of late night incidents in the build-up to the last Ashes tour four years ago, but alcohol has been available in the communal bar areas shared by the teams during the Ashes.

When COVID restrictions have allowed, players have been able to enjoy nights out at certain times given they have had to undergo taxing 'bubble' conditions on numerous occasions and for long periods since the start of the pandemic.

But England management will be equally keen to quash talk of a drinking culture, and the matter could now form part of a tour review by Ashley Giles, the managing director of men's cricket.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220118120724/http://news.sky.com/story/cricket-ecb-investigate-after-police-break-up-post-ashes-drinks-session-at-team-hotel-and-tell-england-and-australia-players-it-is-time-for-bed-12518838;

The Security Service began looking into Malik Faisal Akram, 44, in the second half of 2020 to assess whether he posed a security threat, a Whitehall source said.

The suspicion that had been raised about him was related to Islamist terrorism.

He had also been in prison four times, between 1996 and 2012, for a range of offences including violent disorder, harassment and theft, Sky News understands.

Akram, who was from Blackburn in Lancashire, took four people, including a rabbi, hostage at the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, on Saturday.

He is said to have demanded the release of Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, who was convicted of trying to kill US army officers in Afghanistan, and is in prison in Texas.

Akram was shot dead by an FBI SWAT team 10 hours into the stand-off and all four hostages were released unharmed.

Sky News understands he arrived in the US via New York's JFK International Airport shortly before the New Year before buying the handgun he used in the siege.

Questions have now been raised into how he was able to enter the US with a criminal record and being known to MI5.

Their so-called ""short-lead investigation"" into Akram, however, concluded that there was no ""credible threat to national security at that time"", the source said.

It meant that no longer term investigation or further monitoring of Akram was carried out.

""He never reached the threshold"" to justify further investigation, the source said.

The source declined to say how long Akram had been looked into other than to say that the investigation had lasted more than four weeks and either ended in the back half of 2020 or by early 2021.

After the investigation concluded that Akram did not pose a threat at that time, he would have joined the ranks of some 40,000 individuals who have at some point been a subject of interest of MI5.

A ""short lead investigation"" is a term given for a form of investigative process by MI5 into an individual that comes before a longer term, covert investigation.

Sky News understands that Akram was jailed for six months for violent disorder in 1996 and spent time at a young offenders' institute before being moved to an adult prison.

He was back in prison a year later for destroying property, before another sentence in 1999 for harassment and breaching the terms of his release.

Akram was last remanded into custody in 2012, but the case against him was dropped. However while on remand at HMP Liverpool he was reported by the prison imam for ""concerning at disruptive behaviour"" at Friday prayers.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220118120724/http://news.sky.com/story/texas-synagogue-siege-british-man-who-took-four-hostage-in-colleyville-was-known-to-mi5-12519020;

The investigation will cover at least 13 events in which rules may have been breached and is expected to conclude within the next two weeks.

The probe was initially being led by Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, but he was forced to relieve himself of the duty after it was revealed a Christmas event was held in his own private office in December 2020.

What are the alleged events?

• 15 May 2020

The Guardian have published a photograph, apparently taken from a window in Number 11 Downing Street that overlooks the Number 10 garden, showing Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie on the terrace drinking wine with the prime minister's principal private secretary Martin Reynolds and his then chief adviser Dominic Cummings.

Groups of around 20 other staff are pictured further down the garden speaking around tables.

According to both the Guardian and Independent, Mr Johnson was present for around 15 minutes and told one aide inside Number 10 that they deserved a drink for ""beating back"" coronavirus.

It was reported the event took place after a COVID news conference held by then health secretary Matt Hancock, who is also pictured in the garden.

Sources were quoted as saying that some staff drank until late into the evening.

Mr Cummings has insisted the photograph of himself, Mr Johnson, Mrs Johnson with the couple's newborn baby, and Mr Reynolds was not an example of rule breaking but was instead an example of Number 10 work meetings being held outdoors.

• 20 May 2020

On the evening of 20 May 2020, the PM's principal private secretary Marin Reynolds invited Number 10 staff to ""socially distanced drinks"" in the Downing Street garden to ""make the most of the lovely weather"" during the first national lockdown, according to a leaked email seen by ITV News.

The email reads: ""Hi all, After what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No10 garden this evening. Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!""

When is the partygate report due?

Just an hour earlier, then culture secretary Oliver Dowden had given a Downing Street news briefing, telling people they could ""meet one other person from outside their household"" in a public place outside, providing social distancing was maintained.

At Prime Minister's Questions on 12 January this year, Mr Johnson admitted he went into the Number 10 garden ""just after 6pm on 20 May 2020 to thank groups of staff"" before going back into his office ""25 minutes later"".

The prime minister told MPs he had ""learned enough"" about multiple claims of lockdown-breaching parties in Downing Street ""to know there were things we simply did not get right"".

Issuing an apology, he acknowledged the public ""rage"" about their sense that COVID rules were ""not being properly followed by the people who make the rules"".

But Mr Johnson, referring to the 20 May event, said he ""believed implicitly that this was a work event"".

""With hindsight, I should have sent everyone back inside,"" he added. ""I should have found some other way to thank them.""

This account has been contradicted by Mr Cummings, who says he personally raised questions about whether the event should take place, and accused Mr Johnson of lying to parliament. Downing Street rejected this account.

• 13 November 2020

Mr Cummings left Number 10 clutching a box of his belongings, halfway through England's second national lockdown.

The Treasury has confirmed ""impromptu drinks"" occurred when England was locked down due to rising coronavirus cases.

The Times reported that around two dozen civil servants were present for the drinks on November 25 last year, while officials worked on the autumn Spending Review.

A Treasury spokesman said: ""A number of HMT staff came into the office to work on the Spending Review 2020.

""We have been made aware that a small number of staff had impromptu drinks around their desks after the event.

""The Treasury did not organise an in-person departmental party last Christmas.""

At the time, non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues were closed as well as pubs, bars and restaurants, and people were urged to stay at home except for limited reasons including work if it could not be done from home.

The Times said Chancellor Rishi Sunak was not at the event and it is understood he was not aware of it at the time.

• 15 December 2020

A picture has emerged of the prime minister is taking part in an online Downing Street quiz flanked by colleagues.

The image, published by the Sunday Mirror, shows a screen with Mr Johnson sitting in front of a laptop in the No 10 library.

Downing Street said the Conservative Party leader had ""briefly"" taken part ""virtually"" in the quiz.

The Sunday Mirror said the event happened on December 15.

In response, Labour accused the PM of presiding over a ""culture of disregard for the rules"".

Official guidance at the time stated: ""Although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.""

The Sunday Mirror quoted a source who claimed many staff were huddled by computers, conferring on questions and drinking alcohol while the quiz was taking place.

It reported Mr Johnson surprised staff by turning up on screen as quiz master for one round lasting between 10 and 15 minutes.

A No 10 spokeswoman said: ""This was a virtual quiz.

""Downing Street staff were often required to be in the office to work on the pandemic response so those who were in the office for work may have attended virtually from their desks.

""The prime minister briefly took part virtually in a quiz to thank staff for their hard work throughout the year.""

The Daily Mirror reported that Department for Transport staff held a Christmas party in a Whitehall office, although Transport Secretary Grant Shapps was said not to have been involved in any gathering.

A DfT spokesperson said: ""Fewer than a dozen staff who were working in the office had a low-key, socially distanced, gathering in the large open-plan office after work on 16 December, where food and drink was consumed.

""We recognise this was inappropriate and apologise for the error of judgement.""

• 17 December 2020

Staff in the private office of Cabinet Secretary Simon Case took part in a virtual quiz.

Sky News understands the event was described as a ""Christmas party"" in the diary and involved six people in the office - those who had already been on a rota to be in the office - and around six people taking part at home.

The event lasted an hour with people enjoying snacks and drinks at their desks.

Although Mr Case did not take part, he is understood to have walked through the office to get to his personal office and so was aware of what was happening.

At the end of the day, he walked out and thanked staff in an address lasting five to ten minutes.

On the same evening that Mr Case's own staff held a gathering in his private office, the then-Director-General of the COVID Taskforce Kate Josephs held leaving drinks in the Cabinet Office.

Making a statement on Twitter, Ms Josephs said: ""On the evening of 17 December, I gathered with colleagues that were at work that day, with drinks, in our office in the Cabinet Office, to mark my leaving the civil service.

""I am truly sorry I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result.""

Ms Josephs left the COVID taskforce on 18 December 2020 to become chief executive of Sheffield City Council.

• 18 December 2020

Staff reportedly held a cheese and wine night in Downing Street, just days after stricter Tier 3 restrictions come into effect in London - meaning people were not allowed to mix indoors with anyone outside their household or support bubble.

The party reportedly carried on until 2am with Secret Santa gifts exchanged.

Downing Street director of communications Jack Doyle is also said to have addressed staff and handed out awards.

Around 40 people were in attendance, according to sources who have spoken to Sky News.

A leaked video - filmed four days after the alleged drinks do - showed senior Downing Street aides joking about a ""fictional"" party.

It led to the resignation of Mr Johnson's adviser Allegra Stratton.

• 16 April 2021

According to initial reports in The Telegraph newspaper, two gatherings involved 30 Downing Street staff partying into the early hours at Number 10 at a time when indoor mixing was banned.

The events - which allegedly included people drinking and dancing to music and one attendee being sent shopping with a suitcase to fill with bottles of wine - occurred the night before the Queen was forced to sit by herself at Prince Philip's funeral at St George's Chapel in Windsor.

The prime minister's former director of communications has apologised ""unreservedly"" for one of the parties on this date which was held to mark his departure from Downing Street.

""This event should not have happened at the time that it did. I am deeply sorry, and take full responsibility,"" Mr Slack said.

The two events were held in two different parts of the Downing Street complex but later joined together in the garden, with around 30 people attending both gatherings combined, it is claimed.

The Telegraph reported that one staff member was said to have acted as a DJ at one of the events, while another who was present is reported to have expressed fears that too much wine was being spilled on a carpet.

One eyewitness noted that a staff member used and broke a child's swing in the garden belonging to Mr Johnson's son, Wilfred.

A Number 10 spokesperson told The Telegraph that Mr Johnson was not in Downing Street that day. He is said to have been at Chequers.

What other events are alleged to have taken place?

• Other cases

Meanwhile the Daily Mirror has reported that around 50 staff at Number 10 had ""wine-time Fridays"" scheduled into their electronic calendars between 4pm and 7pm every Friday during various periods of COVID restrictions.

The newspaper published a photograph of what it reported was a £142 drinks fridge being delivered through Downing Street's back entrance on 11 December, 2020.

At the time, London was under ""Tier 2"" restrictions, which prevented people from mixing with other households indoors.

Downing Street has fallen short of denying the allegations, but instead pointed to the Gray inquiry.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has also confirmed that staff working for Therese Coffey drank alcohol and ate takeaways ""late into the evening"" on a number of occasions while coronavirus restrictions were in place.

It comes after the Sunday Mirror reported that political staff and officials frequently drank after work until the early hours of the morning, and ordered food to Ms Coffey's office at the DWP.

The newspaper said some of these evenings took place while hospitality and office parties were banned under COVID regulations.

The DWP has confirmed there were times when alcohol was consumed in a work space outside the cabinet minister's Whitehall office but stressed it took place while work was continuing past normal employment hours.

A source said the desks in the office were socially distanced and there was ""no party atmosphere going on"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220118120724/http://news.sky.com/story/sue-gray-which-lockdown-parties-is-she-investigating-and-what-has-downing-street-said-about-them-12490737;

The Cabinet Office paid more than half a million pounds to market research firm Public First in June 2020, including testing public health slogans such as ""stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives"".

Last year, the High Court ruled the decision to award the contract was unlawful as it gave rise to ""apparent bias"" because of a failure to consider any other research agency and record the objective criteria used in the selection.

Live COVID updates from the UK and around the world

The court heard Cabinet minister Michael Gove also had connections to the owners of Public First, Rachel Wolfe and James Frayne.

Not-for-profit campaigning organisation the Good Law Project brought the original case, which questioned the decision to pay the large sum of taxpayers' money to the firm during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.

Its lawyer, Jason Coppel QC, had argued the contract award was ""a clear and obvious case of apparent bias"".

The government and Mr Cummings denied the accusations.

'Nothing unlawful' in Cummings's involvement, judge says

In a judgment on Tuesday, the Court of Appeal overturned the previous ruling.

Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, sitting with Lord Justice Coulson and Lady Justice Carr, found the question of whether there was apparent bias should have been decided on the reasons behind the decision to give the contract, including that Public First was already doing research and that only two companies had the ""scale, expertise and experience"" to provide the service at the start of the pandemic.

Image: Michael Gove also had connections to the owners of Public First, the court heard

Lord Burnett concluded a fair-minded and reasonably informed observer would have known this and known that there ""was nothing unlawful in the involvement of Mr Cummings in the decision-making process"".

He continued: ""Quite apart from Mr Cummings, experienced civil servants... knew what services were urgently needed in a public health emergency and were intimately familiar with the market for their provision.""

Government's priority 'has always been to save lives'

Mr Cummings said the Court of Appeal ruling was ""total vindication for my decisions on moving super speedy on procurement to save lives"".

He tweeted the Court of Appeal had ""seen sense & said I behaved lawfully"", adding that he had been calling for a ""serious emergency procurement system"" since before the pandemic.

A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""We welcome the Court of Appeal's ruling that this contract was awarded entirely lawfully. This includes the court's firm rejection of the allegation of apparent bias, overturning the previous judgment.

""Throughout the pandemic our priority has always been to save lives and the work by Public First helped to improve vitally important health messages.""

Group to appeal to Supreme Court

Jolyon Maugham, director of the Good Law Project, said the group now intends to take the case to the Supreme Court.

He tweeted: ""This is the first substantive judgment against us since 2019. We think, with respect, it's wrong and we are asking for permission to go to the Supreme Court.""

Following the ruling, Public First founding partner James Frayne said: ""Our team worked unbelievably hard for seven days a week - from early morning until late at night - during the height of the pandemic, helping to refine key messages that reduced the pressure on the NHS and prevented many casualties.

""Today's judgment rightly pays tribute to the team's efforts and reaffirms what we have always known: that they should be proud of their work.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220118120724/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-government-wins-appeal-over-unlawful-coronavirus-contract-given-to-dominic-cummingss-friends-12519003;

From Tuesday, customers who have registered with Aldi's Shop&Go; app, will be able to enter the store, pick up their items, and then walk out.

Aldi's aim is to eliminate long queues in its shops and follows Amazon and Tesco, who have both opened checkout-free sites.

The German-owned retailer said shoppers will also be able to buy alcohol using facial age estimation technology to check whether they appear to be over the age of 25.

Customers must confirm their identity via the app, while those opting out will be age-verified in store.

Who is telling the truth about the ""socially distanced drinks"" in May 2020, to which dozens of people were invited by Boris Johnson's aide Martin Reynolds in an email?

This is now shaping up as the key question in the ""Partygate"" scandal. Is it Mr Cummings, who claims in a bombshell blog that he raised the ""drinks party"" with the PM, and told him to ""grip this madhouse"" - concerns he says the PM brushed aside?

This is an account backed by other, unnamed sources who spoke to Sky's Beth Rigby and other outlets.

Cummings should now be 'key witness' in Sue Gray report - partygate latest

Image: Dominic Cummings also alleged, in a Q&A session, that Boris Johnson knew about an alleged party on 18 December but did not attend.

Or is it Downing Street officials - backed publicly by Dominic Raab this morning - who insist confidently that the PM was not warned and was not aware of any email?

Mr Johnson has so far avoided comment on the email, since telling MPs he ""implicitly believed"" the garden gathering he attended was a work event, and not ""technically"" a breach of the rules.

Mr Cummings claims he would repeat this under oath, but it is unknown whether there is written evidence, or others will back his account to Sue Gray. The prime minister's fate is likely to rest on these questions.

The pressure is piling on this respected senior civil servant, who must rule on the facts of what the prime minister and her civil service, including potentially the cabinet secretary, knew and did. It has no legal status, any breach of the law must be referred to the police, and she ultimately reports to the prime minister.

If the facts alone are damning, she will have effectively unseated her boss if Tory MPs conclude he misled parliament and withdraw support. If there is no evidence or no clarity about breaches of the guidance, some critics will seize on it as a whitewash.

But if that's what Downing Street is pinning its hopes on, there is a troubling development today. While only six Tory MPs - out of 360 - are publicly calling for the PM's resignation, there is a drip, drip of others now saying that even without a smoking gun, the damage is done.

Former minister Desmond Swayne writes online that if even if Ms Gray rules that Downing Street is a place of work and therefore the gathering was technically allowed - what he calls a ""Monopoly get out of jail free card"" - the fear is that this defence won't wash with the public.

Health minister Maria Caulfield, a former NHS nurse who returned to wards during the first lockdown, writes on her website that there was a ""culture in Number 10 where even if rules were not technically broken, the spirit of the rules were"".

Police and paramedics were called but he died before they arrived. Officials were told the incident took place around 11am.

Dean Verberckmoes was reported missing by his family after his babysitter failed to drop him off at his grandparents' house.

Police said the child's body was found at Neeltje Jans in Zeeland province on Monday after officers issued an amber alert with the description of the toddler and a photograph.

A 34-year-old man had been earlier detained by police.

The boy was last seen in the Belgian city of Sint Niklaas near Antwerp with a man, identified as Dave De K by Dutch media including the NOS public broadcaster and NL Times.

The child's mother, Elke Verberckmoes, told Belga he regularly looked after Dean and his younger sister.

Belgian prosecutors told the news agency he was given a 10-year jail sentence in 2010 for abuse which led to the death of a two-year-old. He served eight years and his sentence ended in December 2018.

A large-scale search spanning the two countries was launched after Dean was reported missing.

Dutch police said the suspect was arrested in the town of Meerkerk, south of Utrecht, about 75 miles north-east of where Dean was found.

""Once at that location, a man was found, who turned out to be the missing 34-year-old Belgian. The four-year-old boy was not with him at the time,"" police said.

It was then that officers issued the amber alert.

""The police investigation pointed to a possible crime scene on Monday evening... and a police helicopter also joined the search,"" Dutch police said.

The changes - first introduced to slow the spread of the Omicron variant - will take place from 24 January as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed the country is on a ""downward slope"" of infections.

The requirement for table service in hospitality will come to an end and attendance limits on indoor events will also be lifted, as well as restrictions preventing adults from taking part in indoor contact sport.

However, Ms Sturgeon warned the rate of COVID infections ""is still high"" and urged people to remain cautious in their social interactions.

She said: ""From Monday we will also lift the guidance asking people to stick to a three-household limit on indoor gatherings.

""However, it is important to stress this point: notwithstanding the improving situation, the level of COVID infection circulating in the community is still high.

""So to minimise the risk of us getting the virus it would be sensible for all of us to remain cautious in our social interactions at this stage.""

She continued: ""We will continue to ask people to work from home whenever possible at this stage - and for employers to facilitate this.

""However, we will engage with business now about a return to a more hybrid approach from the start of February.""

There will also be no extension to coronavirus vaccine passports, Ms Sturgeon announced.

It comes as Scotland recorded another 31 coronavirus deaths and a further 7,752 people infected with the virus.

The number of people in hospital has fallen by 21, to 1,546, with 59 people in intensive care, a rise of one.

Ms Sturgeon said over the past week the number of people testing positive with a PCR test had fallen from ""an average of almost 13,000 a day to just over 4,600"" - a drop of 64%, with cases declining in all age groups.

As a result, the first minister said she could ""say with some confidence that the rise in cases driven by Omicron peaked in the first week of January and that we are now on the downward slope of this wave of cases"".

Ms Sturgeon also urged the more than 600,000 Scots over the age of 18 who are eligible for a booster, but haven't yet had it, to come forward.

She said despite the renewed optimism the NHS remained under ""significant pressure"".

The first minister continued: ""Despite what people may be hearing from media commentary, we have not yet moved from the epidemic to the endemic phase of COVID, although I hope that transition is under way.

This comes after fears sexual misconduct survivors are pressured into signing agreements which stop them from speaking out about their experiences and protects the reputations of their abusers.

Six vice-chancellors, including those from Cambridge, Exeter and UCL, have signed up to a pledge which commits universities to stop using legally-binding NDAs against students and staff who report sexual harassment.

But Minister for Higher and Further Education Michelle Donelan has called on all universities ""to do the right thing"" and end the practice.

NDAs silence victims, protect abusers & support a culture where sexual assault and violence can hide.

Those who have experienced sexual harassment ""should never be bought or bullied into silence simply to protect the reputation of their university"", she said.

""Such agreements make it harder for other victims to come forward and help hide perpetrators behind a cloak of anonymity.

""The use of NDAs to buy victims' silence is a far cry from their proper purpose, for example to protect trade secrets. I am determined to see this shabby practice stamped out on our campuses"".

The pledge has been backed by campaign group #Can'tBuyMySilence, set up by Zelda Perkins, a former aide to disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, and law professor Julie Macfarlane.

They said the end of the practice ""will dramatically change the accountability and transparency of universities"" and ""break the cycle of abusive behaviour"" fuelled by NDAs.

Education institutions that sign up to the pledge will feature on the #Can'tBuyMySilence website to encourage others to join.

Binding victims to NDAs 'unethical and unacceptable'

Universities UK chief Alistair Jarvis said a majority of students and staff had a positive experience on campus.

But added that binding victims to confidentiality clauses in agreements was ""unethical and unacceptable"" and prevented ""open conversations about harassment"".

In 2020, a BBC investigation found nearly one third of universities had used NDAs to resolve student complaints.

Unite the Union says Tracey Scholes, 57, has returned to work at the bus depot in Greater Manchester where she has been for 34 years, having been the first woman to work there.

Last year bus operator Go North West changed some of its vehicles, repositioning their wing mirrors so Ms Scholes could no longer see out of them properly.

In September, the company - which is part of the Go Ahead Group - told Ms Scholes she would no longer be able to drive those buses and gave her the option of reducing her hours by five a week - the equivalent to £230 a month, according to Unite.

More than 25,000 people signed a petition on her behalf and she received messages of support from local celebrities including Coronation Street star Julie Hesmondhalgh.

The TUC was also among the groups that said the driver, who is from the borough of Rochdale, faced ""the sack for being too short"".

On 11 January, the mother-of-three lodged a final appeal, with Go North West offering her a deal to reinstate her on 17 January.

The bus company said: ""Beginning this week, she is to start her daily duties earlier in the morning at the Queen's Road depot, allowing her to pick up a bus with wing mirrors of her preference, rather than taking on a vehicle mid-route.

""Weekly hours and rates of pay will be unchanged.""

The child had been taking a skiing lesson on a blue beginners' slope in the ski resort of Flaine, in France's eastern Haute-Savoie department, when the collision occurred at around 11am on Saturday.

The girl, who was named locally as Ophelie, was airlifted to hospital but died while she was still in the helicopter.

Karline Bouisset, the public prosecutor in Bonneville, said the man, who was confirmed to be a volunteer firefighter, had been ""skiing at high speed"".

She said: ""He is a 40-year-old man from Haute-Savoie. He is a regular at the resort. He has been placed under judicial control.

""The child was in a single file behind the group and was about to make a right turn when she was very violently hit by the skier arriving at high speed, who tried in vain to avoid her.""

The suspect, who has not been publicly named, has also been in custody since Saturday in Bonnevile, eastern France.

Ms Bouisset added that several people, including witnesses who saw the accident take place, have been interviewed ""at length"" since Saturday.

The punishment for the crime could be up to five years in prison and a fine of £62,000.

Family 'suffering from extreme shock'

A post-mortem is believed to have taken place yesterday to establish the exact cause of death, but the results have not yet been released.

Jean-Paul Constant, the mayor of nearby Araches, said: ""We are actively looking for a psychologist who speaks English for the family, who have returned to Geneva.

""They are suffering from extreme shock, as are many others involved in this tragedy.""

Ophelie is reported to have lived in Geneva with her British parents, who also own their own holiday home in Alpine ski resort Les Carroz.

Flaine is known for being an upmarket resort that is part of the Grand Massif ski area in the French Alps, which has a large number of gentle blue slopes that are suitable for young and beginner skiers.

The all-cash takeover would give the Xbox maker a leap into the mobile gaming sphere and ""play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms"", according to Microsoft boss Satya Nadella.

The deal - if approved by regulators - would make Microsoft the third-largest gaming firm in the world by revenue.

Its offer of $95 per share was at a premium of 45% to the closing price for Activision's stock on Friday night.

Image: Call of Duty is among Activision's library of games

The shares had slumped by almost 40% since hitting a record high last year after allegations of widespread sexual harassment and other misconduct came to light.

Microsoft said that Activision CEO Bobby Kotick - who had even faced calls to quit from staff over his handling of the claims - would continue in the role after the deal completed.

Activision said on Monday that, while its work to address the problems was continuing, it had fired or pushed out more than 36 staff and disciplined another 40 since July.

Microsoft's move was seen as giving it the edge over fierce console rival Sony - maker of the PlayStation - because of its extended library of games.

Its gaming investments in recent years have included the $7.5bn acquisition of Minecraft maker Mojang Studios.

""The fantastic franchises across Activision Blizzard will also accelerate our plans for Cloud Gaming, allowing more people in more places around the world to participate in the Xbox community using phones, tablets, laptops and other devices you already own,"" the statement added.

""Activision Blizzard games are enjoyed on a variety of platforms and we plan to continue to support those communities moving forward.""

Its shares were trading 32% up at $86 per share in early deals on Wall Street.

Microsoft's were, however, just shy of 2% lower - perhaps reflecting some initial concerns about the price tag and the row over Activision's workplace culture.

Mr Nadella moved to address the issue in a conference call with investors.

The confirmation that Sue Gray will speak to Mr Cummings comes after he alleged that the prime minister knew in advance about a Downing Street drinks party in May 2020 and agreed that it could go ahead.

The Soviet-era vehicle has been converted into a troop carrier; I say converted, in fact I mean everything has been torn out, plywood lines its interior walls and benches have been placed inside to sit on.

Four fairly jolly Ukrainian soldiers, and four of us, squeeze inside the back. Everyone is wearing body armour so it's a tight fit.

Image: Lieutenant Viktor Bieliekov and a converted ambulance

Image: Inside the ambulance converted by Ukrainian forces

The suspension groans as the driver guns the engine and we speed out into the snow-covered countryside - and the frontlines of the war between Ukraine's military and Russian-backed separatist rebels.

While the world waits to see if Russia is actually going to join the conflict and invade Ukraine with its highly sophisticated and generously armed and equipped army, I was waiting to see if this dilapidated machine would actually make the 10 miles to the front.

As my mind wandered back to a possible Russian invasion, I looked at the soldiers crammed into a van that was barely roadworthy and felt sorry for them.

Their unit, equipped as it is, probably wouldn't last the first contact.

I peered through a gap in the plywood into the front cab and beyond into the icy wastelands of the battlefield.

We passed through heavily mined farmlands, passing red signs warning of the danger of stepping or driving off the road.

Image: Ukrainian soldiers taking a rooftop position

The driver slowed briefly then shot forward as fast as he could on the slippery surface.

""The enemy position is all along this side"", one of the soldiers told us, pointing to the right side.

""They shoot at vehicles along here, so the driver goes quickly,"" he said, and then laughed.

The soldiers were taking us to a village we had heard about but needed special permission to visit.

Novoaleksandrovka is closed to the outside world. It's in the no-man's land of the demarcation line that separates the two sides.

Image: A clinic destroyed in fighting

Once home to 200 people, only 11 remain. The fighting here is intense and has been for the eight years this conflict has raged.

We wanted to meet the residents, find out what it's like living on the frontline, and basically find out why on earth they have stayed, and what they will do if indeed the Russians do invade.

We bumped our way to our stopping point: a couple of decrepit looking houses with a few soldiers standing outside.

We emerged into a snowstorm and looked out across the rest of the village. A collection of badly damaged and largely abandoned single-storey houses, covered in snow and ice.

The soldiers indicated we should follow them, and we went off to find some of the inhabitants.

Image: Villagers in Novoaleksandrovka

The eerie quiet of an almost completely abandoned former community was broken by the thud of explosions and the rat-tat-tat of machine gun fire.

It was nearby, but not so near that we needed to take cover.

It's often like this in warzones, you can hear the fighting, but you can't see it. Sometimes, like now, when it's windy and snowy, you can't even tell what direction it's coming from. It's unsettling, it's disconcerting, and it's actually quite scary.

There is nothing in this town apart from the damaged houses: no shops, no electricity, no running water, even the community's only medical clinic has been destroyed.

The soldiers explained that most of the people who have stayed behind rarely leave their homes, particularly in the bitterly cold winters of this country, but mainly because of the fighting. They say the residents are ""hostages"" of the situation.

Image: Inside Halyna's home, which has no electricity

A number of the doors we knocked on, in clearly occupied houses, simply weren't answered. Our local producer said he had been warned that people would be very suspicious of our presence, and too scared to talk.

But Halyna, a spritely 73-year-old who lives by herself, was more than happy to welcome us inside. Above her front door, she has written in chalk ""Domestic Residence"". It's a message for soldiers and separatists alike, that her home is not abandoned.

She showed me how all her windows were smashed by bombs during the worst fighting. She said at times it was so bad that she lay next to her brick oven for protection, clutching her important documents and prepared to run if she has to.

There's no electricity, no shops or medical services, but she's got nowhere to go. More importantly, she doesn't want to go. Halyna is repairing her home - the windows first, and then the damaged ceiling.

""I'm used to it here. I feel good. There are few of us left here, but people are still here. Well, I like it here"", she explained.

""I have everything in the garden, I plant, I work. The only thing is that I have to walk far distances because there is no transport.""

Halyna doesn't believe Russia will invade, but said that if they do, she plans to stay, because she doesn't think they'd be interested in harming her.

The army point out it really is too dangerous for anyone to stay here. But they won't force them to leave.

Image: An abandoned home

From overwatch positions on the roofs of houses in the village, the soldiers keep a continuous eye on the separatist positions 100 or so metres away.

Lieutenant Viktor Bieliekov, a senior officer in the 24th battalion, reflected the views of many soldiers we have met on this trip, and previous ones here.

They say they've been at war for eight years anyway, and rarely, if ever, discuss a Russian invasion - although they accept it could happen.

Atata, an island close to the capital, has seen most of its buildings destroyed and people who work at a holiday resort are believed to be missing.

Sky News has looked at some of the islands which have been amongst the worst hit.

Atata

A 20-minute boat ride from the capital Nuku'alofa, the island was home to 61 people and housed a school and a holiday resort.

But more recent images show the aftermath of the tsunami hitting the island, where almost all the buildings have been destroyed.

Facebook posts by the hotel showed that most on the island were evacuated or reached higher ground, but that three people who worked at the resort remained unaccounted for.

Remote islands to the northeast of the eruption, almost 100 miles from the country's main island, have also been particularly badly hit.

Mango Island

On Mango Island at least 20 buildings - home to the island's 36 inhabitants - have been lost to the tsunami.

At least one of those who call the island home, a 65-year-old woman, died in the wake of the damage, according to a government announcement on Tuesday.

Imagery now shows makeshift tarpaulin structures across the beach as the evacuation effort continues.

Mango island is one of three in the area, alongside Fonoifua and Nomuka, which have been severely damaged.

Fonoifua

All but two structures on Fonoifua island, six miles northeast of Mango Island, have been destroyed or extensively damaged.

An evacuation effort is underway for the 32 people there, according to 2016 figures, and medical responders have been deployed.

Nomuka

On Nomuka, six miles northwest of Mango, debris can be seen scattered in the pond on the south of the island. Almost all coastal buildings were destroyed.

Nuku'alofa and airport

Further south, the capital Nuku'alofa had comparably less damage.

Low lying homes were moderately damaged and the city, including its port, experienced flooding. The area was also covered in a layer of ash.

Ash can be seen on Fua'amota International Airport's runways, leaving them unserviceable. Groups were pictured attempting to clear them using shovels and wheelbarrows.

Lifuka Island Airport, over 110 miles north of the capital, is also assumed to be unserviceable due to ash.

This has hampered relief efforts such as the delivery of fresh supplies and is one of many infrastructures issues now facing Tonga.

The pressure on the PM shows no signs of abating, however, with one Conservative MP telling Sky News politics producer Mollie Malone that things are ""nearly there"" in terms of reaching the required 54 letters to trigger a vote of no-confidence in his leadership.

They described the past weekend as a ""turning point"" and said they give the PM ""a week"" before he is gone.

Another told political correspondent Joe Pike that the PM looked ""absolutely beaten"" in his latest interview, describing his performance as ""awful"" and like a ""bad amateur dramatics performance"".

Meanwhile, deputy political editor Sam Coates has been told that ""lots of conversations"" are happening between 2019 intake Tory MPs and there is a ""resolve"" among them that Mr Johnson should go.

""But there's a fear if the vote of no confidence comes before the Sue Gray report is out then Boris Johnson might win, and he could be safe for a year. They think things might not move before then,"" Coates added.

Mr Johnson's latest comments come following claims from his former top adviser Dominic Cummings that the prime minister knew in advance about the Downing Street drinks party - which Number 10 has denied.

Mr Johnson said: ""My memory is going out into the garden for about 25 minutes, which I implicitly thought was a work event, and talking to staff, thanking staff.

""I then went back to my office and continued my work.

""I carry full responsibility for what took place, nobody said to me 'this is an event that's against the rules, in breach of what we're asking everybody else to do'.""

He added that is exactly what he has told the inquiry into several Downing Street lockdown events by top civil servant Sue Gray, who is due to report back next week.

PM: 'I should have told people to go back indoors'

Mr Johnson admitted on reflection he ""should have looked around and told people to go back indoors"" after realising it was not a work event.

He said he wanted to ""repeat my apologies for misjudgements I've made"" after saying sorry in the House of Commons last week following mounting pressure over attending the event.

Asked about two parties alleged to have taken place on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral, Mr Johnson looked down and appeared distressed.

""I deeply and bitterly regret that happened, I can only renew my apology to Her Majesty and to apologise for misjudgements made and for which I take full responsibility,"" he said.

Analysis: PM knows how much trouble he's in Beth Rigby Political editor @BethRigby Boris Johnson looked beaten, distressed and out of options. His tone was intended to reiterate that humble apology which he says he gave in the House of Commons last week. But when we drove into the detail about what he did or didn't know, it was uncomfortable. He was clear he had no recollection of Dominic Cummings verbally warning him about the event on 20 May going ahead, or that he was warned that it could be in breach of guidelines. It will be up to Sue Gray to uncover the truth. But where is he right now? It's clear the prime minister is feeling the pressure and clearly understands the trouble he is in. For me, the most striking moment of the interview was when I asked him about those parties held on the night before the funeral of Prince Philip. He looked visibility upset about that. He hung his head and said he deeply and bitterly regretted that that happened. And he apologised to the Queen and to the country. I asked him repeatedly if it emerges that he misled parliament whether he would resign? He didn't rule it out. He said he would wait for the Sue Gray report. He was dodging the question, but it won't go away - and even then there's another question: can this PM hold on, or does his party think it's time to go? That is a very, very precarious position from him to be in.

Mr Cummings yesterday claimed Mr Johnson gave the May 2020 garden party the go-ahead so lied to parliament when he said he did not know, but the PM denied this.

Mr Johnson also said he only saw the email invite for the event from his right-hand man Martin Reynolds the other day, when it was revealed to the media.

The PM is facing calls for his resignation, including from some of his own MPs, over the issue but has said the investigation into the parties must be allowed ""space"" to be concluded.

Labour says PM 'clearly knows it's end of the road'

Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, reacting to the PM's interview, said he ""clearly knows it's the end of the road"".

""He's the prime minister, he set the rules, he didn't need anyone to tell him that the party he attended broke them,"" she said.

""If he had any respect for the British public, he would do the decent thing and resign.""

Five things we learned from Johnson interview Joe Pike Political correspondent @joepike His core defence is now ""nobody told me"" - the PM argues his team did not tell him Number 10 garden party was against the rules.

The PM specifically denied Dominic Cummings's claim that he lied.

The PM confirmed he personally apologised to the Queen for the raucous Number 10 parties held the night before her husband's funeral.

Mr Johnson also confirmed he has spoken to senior civil servant Sue Gray as part of her investigation into rule-breaking parties.

The prime minister did not rule out resigning.

Senior Tories leave open idea PM would have to resign if code breached

Senior cabinet members have said they believe Mr Johnson, but both Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab and Chancellor Rishi Sunak pointed out the ministerial code ""is clear on these matters"".

The code says: ""It is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity.

""Ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the prime minister.""

Mr Sunak, when asked if he supported the PM unequivocally, got up and left without answering.

Before that, asked if he believed the PM, he said: ""Of course I do, the prime minister set out his understanding of this matter in parliament last week and I'd refer you to his words.

""As you know, Sue Gray is conducting an enquiry into this matter and I fully support the prime minister's request for patience while that inquiry concludes.""

The chancellor said he would not ""get into hypotheticals"" following Mr Cummings' claim Mr Johnson lied to parliament.

Appearing for the first time in public after nearly a week, to face further accusations over Downing Street parties and exactly what he knew about when, he looked defeated.

The list of questions was difficult, and the pressure, dismay and distress were plain to see in Boris Johnson's expressions and his body language - even with a mask on - as he repeatedly dropped his head.

Did Dominic Cummings personally tell the PM the 20 May party was a bad idea? A second No 10 source has corroborated Mr Cummings' account to me and said they also believe the PM was warned.

And if so, did the PM lie to parliament? Will he resign if it emerges that he did mislead parliament and is he worried his MPs are preparing to oust him?

It was also the first time he'd appeared in public since reports emerged - not denied by Downing Street - of two boozy parties at No 10 the night before the Queen laid her husband Prince Philip to rest after 73 years of marriage.

Did the prime minister feel shame about that?

""I can only renew my apologies both to Her Majesty and to the country for misjudgements that were made, and for which I take full responsibility.""

And then on the matter of the ""bring your own booze"" event in the Downing Street garden when social gathering had been explicitly banned by Mr Johnson and his team, the PM said in the interview that ""nobody said to me that this was an event that is against the rules"" ahead of time, challenging Mr Cummings' version of events.

But even if he hadn't know then - and what he knew when will be pored over when Sue Gray reports - how could he not see that tables laid up in the garden with food and booze and 40 attendees wasn't a party?

Does he really need Ms Gray to tell him that?

Isn't that a ridiculous defence that people will see straight through, particularly given that in May 2020 there wasn't any such thing as a ""work event"" anyhow. People were not allowed to socialise at work or in their own homes.

On Wednesday, Mr Johnson will face more questions at PMQs.

Sir Keir Starmer will no doubt ask the PM to repeat this denials about being alerted to the danger of the No 10 event ahead of time, in order to get it on the record in the House of Commons.

If evidence emerges to the contrary, the situation takes on another turn with even his chancellor acknowledging when pressed on Tuesday that ""the ministerial code is clear on these matters"" when asked whether the PM should resign if he's lied to parliament.

The atmosphere is beyond awful in parliament. Everyone is on edge.

There are a handful of MPs who have gone out to defend the PM, but the mood is desperate.

One senior Conservative told me this afternoon that he cannot find one person who doesn't think it's over for the PM and it's just a question of time.

""The question is when enough decide they want it over and how quickly,"" one figure told me.

""Those most focused are the ones facing local elections in May and are asking themselves whether than want to lose loads of councillors before they move against him or to go earlier.""

Another MP from the 2019 intake also told Sky News they think they are ""nearly there"" when it comes to these matters and believe the weekend was a turning point.

This particular MP said they give the PM ""a week"" before things move.

Of course, much will depend on the Gray report and also whether more revelations drip out in the coming days - Dominic Cummings has alluded to photos while MPs whisper about talk of even more parties in Downing Street.

But based on Tuesday's performance, you have to wonder whether the PM fears his time is up too?

He will no doubt keep on fighting for as long as he can, and hope that Sue Gray's report will give him enough cover to escape the corner he's in.

Perhaps it will come down to a ""he said, she said"" account of events with two men - Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings - giving their version of what happened and there is no smoking gun or piece of evidence that condemns the PM.

But even if - and it's a very big if - the PM can survive Partygate, can he ever recover the public's trust?

What is the licence fee and how does it work?

The annual BBC licence fee - which currently costs £159 - is required by any household consuming BBC television channels, radio and online programmes and services including iPlayer, Radio 1, CBeebies and the World Service.

This applies to all forms of transmission including using the iPlayer on smart television, laptops and tablets.

It also funds Welsh language TV channel S4C and local TV channels and in total is reported to be worth around £3.2bn to the BBC.

The licence fee was introduced in 1946 when broadcasting recommenced after the Second World War.

The BBC licence fee payment, which is set by the government, usually rises in April each year.

In 2016, the government said the cost would rise in line with inflation for five years from April 2017.

But speaking in the Commons on Monday, Ms Dorries confirmed the BBC licence fee will be frozen at £159 for the next two years before rising with inflation for the four years after that.

This equates to a severe real-terms cut for the corporation.

But with reports the Conservative government plans to axe the licence fee beyond the end of the current charter in December 2027, what alternatives are there to funding the corporation in the long term?

Image: People could pay a subscription to consume BBC programming and servicing like they do for streaming giants such as Netflix

Voluntary subscription fee

A subscription service, like the systems used by streaming giants Netflix and Amazon Prime, would see people voluntarily paying a monthly or annual sum to consume BBC programming and services.

It would mean those who use BBC services could opt in to continue to do so, whereas others who believe they have no need for the current BBC licence could opt out.

A subscription fee could be pitched at a more expensive price point in comparison to the current £159 TV licence as fewer people may opt in to pay the sum.

It could also result in a loss of income for the BBC if a significant proportion of households who currently have a BBC licence do not sign up to the subscription service to continue to do so.

Another potential issue with this option is that some services - like the vast amount of local television and radio broadcast by the corporation - would be difficult to place behind what would effectively be a paywall.

Image: The BBC does not currently host adverts on its domestic channels

Advertising

Another way the BBC could increase its funding is by including advertising on its website, TV channels and radio stations.

At present, the BBC does not have advert breaks on its domestic TV channels like BBC One, BBC Two and the BBC News Channel and its website is free from advertising, but its international channels including BBC World do.

The corporation say these ""help fund BBC services and keep the licence fee lower than it otherwise would be"".

Other national broadcasters in the UK - including fellow public service broadcasters ITV and Channel 4 - already carry adverts, so it would be feasible for the BBC to do the same.

However, such a move could potentially make the BBC more inclined to consider programmes which draw in more viewers and subsequently reduce the diversity of its programming.

It is also unlikely that advertising revenue alone would be enough to sustain the BBC's current broad range of services.

Image: The government could directly give public broadcast media an annual grant to spend on their programming and services

Government grants

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation is Australia's national broadcaster and for the majority of its existence has been funded by an annual grant by the government of the day.

If applied to the BBC, this option would cut out the need to collect a sum from each individual household in the UK and would instead involve the UK government directly giving the corporation a set amount of funding for the year.

However, the BBC's remit is that it is an independent and impartial broadcaster, and receiving funding directly from the government may jeopardise the BBC's editorial independence.

It would also mean the government would remain in charge of how much funding the broadcaster will receive, meaning the corporation's budget could be dramatically slashed if the government of the day wished to do so.

Image: A broadband levy could be introduced as an alternative option to the licence fee

Broadband levy

An alternative option would be for the BBC to introduce a broadband levy on every connection in the UK.

This move would modernise the current approach, whereby the licence fee is levied from a household's television.

It would mean every household would continue to pay a sum to use BBC services and this sum could be collected by their broadband provider and passed on to the BBC.

However, one problem with this idea is that it would again make it hard for people who require the internet to opt-out of paying the fee.

Another concern is that it would bump up the price of broadband for households at a time when the cost of living is rising and could make the internet too expensive for some to afford.

Image: A new tax could be created specifically for funding public service media

Introduce new tax directly for public media

In 2019, Sweden removed its TV licence model and instead introduced a new tax on people's income to fund public service television and radio in the country.

The tax, which everyone pays regardless of whether they own a television or not, amounts to 1% of an individual's income and is capped at a certain amount - in 2019 this was 1,300 kronor (£105.16 at the current exchange rate).

Those who earn fewer than 13,600 kroner a month (£1,100.40 at the current exchange rate) pay a reduced fee, and those who do not have an income or are students do not have to pay.

The money is paid into a pot which goes directly to public service media, which if implemented for the BBC, would reduce the risk of the corporation's editorial independence being compromised.

Such a move would see a new tax appearing on British payslips alongside income tax and national insurance contributions from 2028.

Image: BBC director-general Tim Davie said he was 'disappointed' by the government's licence fee announcement on Monday

Other options:

However, another option which would enable the plethora of programming and services provided by the BBC to remain into the next decade would be for the government to keep the BBC licence fee beyond December 2027 and to either freeze its then cost or to let it rise with inflation.

In August 2020, people over 75 began paying for their TV licences, which they previously received for free, generating more income for the corporation.

The BBC now means-tests the entitlement and over-75s must be getting pension credit to receive a licence without charge.

The BBC agreed to take on responsibility for funding the scheme as part of the charter agreement hammered out with the government in 2015.

It has said it cannot afford to continue the universal entitlement, which would hit ""programmes and services"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220118200853/http://news.sky.com/story/bbc-licence-fee-what-could-alternative-funding-methods-look-like-beyond-2027-12519149;

The name of the new capital will be Nusantara, which translates as ""archipelago"", and was chosen by the country's president Joko Widodo.

The relocation to the jungle of Kalimantan on Borneo island will start between 2022 and 2024, with roads and ports being prioritised to allow access, the finance ministry confirmed.

The president first announced his plan in 2019, but it was delayed due to COVID.

No timeframe has been set for the project to be finished and Jakarta will remain the capital until a presidential decree is issued to formalise the change.

Planning minister Suharso Monoarfa told parliament after the bill was passed into law: ""The new capital has a central function and is a symbol of the identity of the nation, as well as a new centre of economic gravity.""

He also said Indonesia would be following in the footsteps of new capitals in other countries, including Brazil and Myanmar.

He said: ""The relocation of the capital city to Kalimantan is based on several considerations, regional advantages, and welfare. With the vision of the birth of a new economic centre of gravity in the middle of the archipelago.""

Indonesia sets sights on becoming 'super hub'

The government said in a statement that the new capital is set to strengthen supply chains and put Indonesia ""in a more strategic position in world trade routes, investment flows, and technological innovation"".

Indonesia, which is southeast Asia's largest economy, wants the new capital to be a low-carbon ""super hub"" that will help support pharmaceutical, health and technology sectors and promote sustainable growth beyond Java island.

The band, which formed in 1976, consists of frontman Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Junior who all met in school in Dublin.

They have had a string of UK number one albums across its 40-year career and sold more than 157 million albums.

Speaking on the Awards Chatter podcast, alongside fellow bandmate The Edge, Bono said: ""I've been in a car when one of our songs has come on the radio, and I've been the colour of - as we say in Dublin - scarlet.

""I'm just embarrassed. I do think U2 pushes out the boat on embarrassment quite a lot.

Image: Both Bono and The Edge said they were not fans of the band name

""And maybe that's the place to be as an artist is right at the edge of your level of pain for embarrassment, your level of embarrassment.""

Bono said he was most proud of their song Vertigo, but added: ""Most of the other ones make me cringe a little bit.""

The Dublin-born rocker, 61, said his voice sounds ""strained"" so he finds it hard to listen to: ""The band sound incredible.""

He said he had ""only become a singer recently"" after listening to the music of the Ramones and ""realising I didn't have to be that rock and roll singer"".

He said singer-songwriter Robert Palmer met bandmate Clayton in the 1980s and told him: ""God, would you ever tell your singer to just take down the keys a little bit, he'd do himself a favour, do his voice a favour and he'd do us all a favour who have to listen to him"".

Both Bono and The Edge, 60, revealed the group were not particularly fond of their band name.

U2 had originally been named The Hype, but they felt the name was obvious and unoriginal. It was their friend and graphic artist Steve Averill who suggested the name.

The Edge recalled: ""Of the suggestions, it wasn't that it jumped out to us as the name we were really looking for, but it was the one that we hated the least.

""And what we loved about it was that it was not obvious from the name what this band would sound like or be about.

""It felt fresh in that sense.""

Bono remarked that he was still not a fan of the name, saying: ""I still don't. I really don't.

Meghan asked for clarification from the corporation that she had actually apologised for ""not remembering"" that she knew a former aide had helped with controversial royal biography Finding Freedom.

A statement issued by the BBC on its website under Corrections and Clarifications said: ""We stated that the Duchess of Sussex apologised for misleading the court in her case against Associated Newspaper Group.

""The Duchess of Sussex has asked us to clarify that she apologised to the court for not remembering email exchanges with her former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, in her evidence, and said that she had no intention to mislead the court.""

Image: The BBC's media editor Amol Rajan

BBC media editor Amol Rajan had said in the Harry, Meghan And The Media podcast that the duchess cooperated with Finding Freedom author Omid Scobie and Meghan ""apologised for misleading a court on this"".

The book, written by Mr Scobie and Carolyn Durand, was published in 2020 and the issue of how much she knew about it came up in her case against the newspaper.

The duchess' lawyers said at the High Court in September 2020 that accusations Meghan ""collaborated"" with the writers was a ""conspiracy theory"".

But two months later it emerged that she allowed an unnamed individual to speak to the authors to prevent ""further misinformation"".

Mr Knauf told the Court of Appeal a year later that he discussed the book on a routine basis.

Meghan, he said, gave him several briefing points to share with the authors, including about her childhood relationship with her half-siblings.

In a written statement to the Court of Appeal in November 2021, the duchess said: ""I accept that Mr Knauf did provide some information to the authors for the book and that he did so with my knowledge, for a meeting that he planned for with the authors in his capacity as communications secretary.

""The extent of the information he shared is unknown to me.

""When I approved the passage…I did not have the benefit of seeing these emails and I apologise to the court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time. I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court.""

Mr Rajan said on the podcast: ""It has since been revealed that Meghan Markle co-operated with him [Scobie] on the project. She's apologised for misleading a court on this.""

Meghan won her long-running High Court case against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) - publisher of the Mail On Sunday and Mail Online - after suing over five articles that reproduced parts of a ""personal and private letter"" to her father.

In December, the Court of Appeal denied ANL's request to take the case to trial.

She was awarded £1, a ""substantial"" undisclosed sum for copyright infringement, and £300,000 of her legal costs earlier this month.

It is not the first time Mr Rajan has incurred the royals' displeasure.

His documentary about Harry and William's relationship with the media was jointly criticised by the royal households - Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace - for giving credibility to ""overblown and unfounded claims"".

A Christmas carol service led by the Duchess of Cambridge, due to be shown by the BBC, was moved to ITV as a result.

Mr Rajan later apologised for comments he made a decade ago when he called the Duke of Edinburgh a ""racist buffoon"" and the Prince of Wales ""scientifically illiterate"", while writing for The Independent.

It turns out the animals' gut bacteria changes in the season when nutritious bamboo shoots become available.

This helps the bears store more fat and could compensate for the lack of nutrients in seasons when there are only bamboo leaves to chew on, a study by the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggests.

Image: Female baby pandas can grow to up to 90kg, while males can reach about 136kg

Pandas eat between 26 to 84 pounds of bamboo each day depending on what part of the plants they are consuming.

Guangping Huang, one of the study's authors, said: ""This is the first time we established a causal relationship between a panda's gut microbiota and its phenotype.

""We've known these pandas have a different set of gut microbiota during the shoot-eating season for a long time, and it's very obvious that they are chubbier during this time of the year.""

A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter - but females can grow up to about 90kg, while males can reach about 136kg, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

During late spring and early summer, bamboo shoots the animals consume protein-rich newly sprouted bamboo shoots - a change from the usual fibrous bamboo that is available.

The experts, who studied wild pandas in the Qinling Mountains in central China, found that they have a significantly higher level of a bacterium called clostridium butyricum in their gut during shoot-eating season.

To test the effect of this change on a panda's metabolism, they conducted a faecal transplant of panda faeces collected in the wild to germ-free mice.

Image: Baby pandas are the size of a stick of butter when they are born

For three weeks the mice were then fed a bamboo-based diet similar to what pandas eat.

The mice transplanted with panda faeces collected during the shoot-eating season gained much more weight and had more fat than mice transplanted with faeces from the leaf-eating season.

The authors believe the bacterium could lead the bears to store more fat.

Peter Swailes, 56, pleaded guilty at Carlisle Crown Court on Tuesday before his modern slavery trial was due to begin.

He had previously denied conspiring with his father, also Peter Swailes, 81, to arrange or facilitate the travel of an individual between 2015 and 2019 with a view to him being exploited.

His father pleaded not guilty to the same charge but died last year before standing trial.

Victim paid as little as £10 a day

Investigators carried out a search warrant at a caravan park near Carlisle on 3 October 2018.

As their continued their searches, they knocked on the door of the shed and the victim, then in his late 50s, opened the door.

The cramped structure had no heating, a soiled duvet on the floor and a metered television.

The man told police he worked on farms, painting, slating and tarmacking, and was paid as little as £10 per day.

He appeared dishevelled and agitated as he informed them he had been living there for four decades.

He then asked if he could have a wash, indicating that he washed in a kitchen sink in a building next to his shed.

The shed was in poor condition, especially compared to another shed on site used for the family dog to sleep in, police said.

After his rescue, the man received specialist help and now lives in supported accommodation.

The shed was next to a static caravan, where the older Peter Swailes was arrested and responded by saying: ""Not this slavery thing again.""

During the course of the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority's investigations, it became clear that Swailes's son was suspected of the same offences and he was arrested in April 2019.

GLAA senior investigating officer Martin Plimmer said the three-year investigation has been ""really harrowing"".

""In all my years in law enforcement, I have never known a modern slavery case where the exploitation has taken place over such a long period of time,"" he said.

He said he was pleased that Swailes has ""finally done the right thing"" and said the victim is ""first and foremost"" in his mind.

""Let's remember that he has been exploited for all his adult life up until just a few years ago,"" he said.

""He is now in his early 60s.

""This is something that even now I struggle to comprehend.

""For four decades, he was in effect kept as a slave.

""We are sadly all too aware of the fact that he will be traumatised by his experience for the rest of his life.""

Malik Faisal Akram, 44, arrived in the US at Kennedy Airport in New York on 29 December and was questioned by customs officials, but as there were no red flags in the system he was allowed to enter the country, according to NBC.

Akram, who took four people including a rabbi hostage, had told family members he wanted to get married and was going to go to Texas to find a Mexican bride.

Hostage-taker 'purchased stolen gun'

After two days he asked relatives in Britain for more money to get to Texas and took a flight to Dallas Fort Worth on New Years' Eve, the broadcaster said.

He stayed in homeless shelters in the Dallas area in the days before the attack on Saturday.

It is believed he purchased a gun on the streets which had been stolen in 2020.

Akram demanded release of al Qaeda suspect

During the standoff with police in Colleyville, Akram demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist who is suspected of having ties to al Qaeda and was convicted of trying to kill US troops in Afghanistan.

The prison where Siddiqui is serving her sentence is in nearby Fort Worth.

The standoff ended when the last of the hostages ran out of the synagogue and an FBI SWAT team rushed in 10 hours into the standoff and shot Akram dead. All four hostages were unharmed.

Akram is understood to have been investigated by MI5 in the second half of 2020, but it has emerged that he was not believed to have been on the US Terrorist Screening Database.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: ""Our understanding, and obviously we're still looking into this, is that he was checked against US government databases multiple times prior to entering the country, and the US government did not have any derogatory information about the individual in our systems at the time of entry.

She added: ""We're certainly looking back ... what occurred to learn every possible lesson we can to prevent attacks like this in the future.""

Military surveillance flights have been sent from Australia and New Zealand to assess the damage caused by Saturday's eruption from the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano.

Tonga is comprised of 176 islands, only 36 of them inhabited, with a population of just over 104,000 people. It has been largely cut off from the world after an undersea communication cable was severed - repairs will take some time and there is still volcanic activity in the area.

The tsunami warning system went down following the initial blast, Mr Coldrick said, adding: ""Communications were completely severed, but everyone knew this was so drastic that people did move away from the water.""

He said the island he is living on is in ""fearful limbo"" as they wait for communications to be restored: ""There has been this general sense of shock because we are kind of in the dark because there is no effective communication between the islands.

""We are worried about people on the main island.""

Vava'u, which is several hundred kilometres away from the main island of Tonga, had a ""light dusting of ash"" from the volcano.

Civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch is seeking a judicial review of a scheme it described as ""draconian, discriminatory and pointless"".

The NHS COVID pass was introduced in Wales in October, and allows people to prove they are vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test so they can attend large events or venues.

People attending cinemas, concert halls, theatres, nightclubs and other large events, are required to present a COVID pass.

The Welsh Government said they were brought in to ""keep businesses open while also helping to control the spread of the virus and protect the NHS"".

But Big Brother Watch said the reasons behind the scheme ""don't stand up to scrutiny"" and wants full disclosure of the documents and advice that led Welsh ministers to impose the measure.

The group claims it creates ""significant and far-reaching"" rights interferences.

It has also begun a legal challenge against the COVID pass scheme in England, and is urging the UK government to scrap the English scheme by the end of January.

The group's director Silkie Carlo said: ""We support proportionate measures to protect public health, but there is exceptionally weak evidence supporting the role of COVID passes.

""We're calling on the Welsh government to disclose the documents and advice they say they're relying on to impose the COVID pass scheme on people in Wales. Their refusal to do so raises suspicions that the government's case is weak or non-existent.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 6:58 Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood: COVID passports for big indoor events are 'illogical'

""The reluctance to be transparent now even extends to an unwillingness to consent to Big Brother Watch publishing the legal papers from its own claim, presumably because they quote from correspondence that attempts to justify the scheme.

""If COVID passes are having no noticeable effect on public health in Wales, as appears to be the case, there is simply no justification for them. Mandatory COVID IDs are a disproportionate intrusion of medical privacy, an erosion of freedom and a threat to equality.""

Shirin Marker, the Bindmans solicitor representing the group, said: ""It is also important that the legal process on a matter of public interest like this is transparent, which is why we are seeking the court's permission to allow Big Brother Watch to fully publish details of its claim.""

A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The COVID pass has been introduced as one measure - among many - to help keep businesses open while also helping to control the spread of the virus and protect the NHS.

""The venues where the COVID pass is required have been chosen because they are mostly indoors and they see large numbers of people congregating closely together for prolonged periods of time. As we know, the longer large numbers of people are close together, especially indoors, the greater the risk of transmission.

""A stakeholder group were kept informed of plans and decisions. We continue to support businesses that are required by law to ask for a COVID pass with a range of advice and guidance.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220119023308/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-legal-challenge-launched-against-covid-pass-in-wales-12519292;

The consumer group said Aldi was the cheapest supermarket for six of the last 12 months while Lidl - the winner during 2020 - was the cheapest for five, including December.

It comes to its findings by measuring the price of a basket of everyday groceries.

Which? tracked an average increase of 3.4% across the major supermarket chains during 2021.

Waitrose prices increased the most - by 9.2% - and Sainsbury's the least, at 0.59%.

When it came to December and the run-up to Christmas, Waitrose was found to be more than £9, or 41%, more expensive than Lidl, at £32.85 for a basket of 22 items.

Lidl's basket came in at £23.29 compared with Aldi's £23.64.

The shopping list combined branded items such as Kenco coffee, Oxo stock cubes and PG Tips tea bags with own-label products including onions and milk, selected to ensure they were as comparable as possible across the retailers on factors such as weight and quality.

The findings were released as charities warn that millions more families are facing a stark choice between eating and heating amid a sharp rise in the cost of living, chiefly led by unprecedented increases in energy prices.

But now they also find themselves being asked to weigh in on geopolitical issues.

Some will argue that athletes have a duty to speak out on human rights issues. Other sportspeople have done so with success. Lewis Hamilton publicly criticised Qatar over its record ahead of the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held there.

Tennis stars, including Andy Murray, voiced concerns over Peng Shuai when she disappeared from view after alleging she had been sexually assaulted by a very high-ranking Chinese Communist Party official.

And one of the most enduring Olympic images of all time is that of Tommie Smith and John Carlos raising black-gloved fists on the podium at the 1968 Summer Olympics.

Speaking out could come with a heavy cost

But speaking out could come with a heavy cost for Olympic athletes. They will be competing in China itself, not Mexico as Smith and Carlos were.

It may seem unlikely that China would detain a foreign Olympian. But the risk is certainly not zero.

This is a country that has had no hesitation in apparently silencing one of its own former Olympians, tennis player Peng Shuai. And no hesitation either in detaining two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, in what was seen as retaliation for Canada detaining a Huawei executive.

And then there are the wider considerations. Most Winter Olympians don't have the profile of Lewis Hamilton or Andy Murray. And any comments they do make will certainly not be reported in China.

And you could argue that it's the job of governments, not competitors, to take a stand.

Athletes are in a tough position

It would be unfair to criticise any athlete who does make a public comment. They are in a tough position and it is not one of their own making.

China has criticised the diplomatic boycotts, saying they are merely ""political manipulation"" and that the countries involved will pay an unspecified ""price"" for their actions. It denies allegations of human rights abuses.

Amnesty said: ""The British Olympic Association should ensure that all Team GB participants are aware of the gravity of the human rights situation in China and that they're given every opportunity to speak out about human rights if they wish to do so.""

1244;1244;COVID-19: Pandemic could be over this year after rapid spread of Omicron and vaccine rollout, leading public health expert says;Wednesday 19 January 2022 03:07, UK;['tom clarke', '@atomclarke'];['covid-19', 'coronavirus'];['sir', 'vaccines', 'leading', 'delta', 'trust', 'health', 'covid19', 'rollout', 'pandemic', 'omicron', 'future', 'needed', 'expert', 'rapid', 'jeremy', 'spread', 'vaccine', 'public'];"The rapid spread of the Omicron variant, combined with the roll-out of up to 20bn doses of vaccine means the COVID-19 pandemic could be over this year, according to one of the world's leading public health experts.

But Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and former SAGE adviser told Sky News that more transparency, particularly around the origins of the COVID will be needed to prevent future pandemics.

""The UK in particular and some other countries are in a very, very strong position now. They have fantastic rollout of vaccines and there's a high degree of natural immunity,"" he said.

It was reasonable for the government to start looking at lifting restrictions he said. But not all of them. ""I wouldn't lift everything at the end of January, when the NHS is still under pressure and we're still in the middle, of course, of winter.""

World in 'pretty dire situation'

Right now, the rest of the world remains in a ""pretty dire situation"", according to Sir Jeremy, due to low vaccination rates and the incredibly rapid spread of the Omicron variant.

While that is causing surges in mortality, the emerging data, even from countries with low vaccination coverage, is that the Omicron wave is less deadly than previous ones.

The more infectious variant will have increased levels of COVID-19 immunity globally. And that is soon to be improved by rapidly increasing global vaccine roll-out.

Vaccine dose availability increasing exponentially

Image: A vaccinator prepares vaccines at a COVID-19 booster vaccination centre at the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast

Availability of vaccine doses is increasing exponentially, boosting reserves of COVAX, the global vaccine sharing initiative. Last week COVAX delivered its billionth dose. And will soon have around 20 billion doses of vaccines available.

""If you think there are seven billion people or so in the world, we should now in the first half of 2022, be able to get vaccines to everybody that wants it in every country in the world, and that has got to be our target,"" said Sir Jeremy.

The Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation have pledged a combined $300m (£221m) for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations which has helped make COVID vaccines available to poorer countries and continues to work on ""variant-proof"" vaccines reducing the risk of future coronavirus pandemics.

Image: Health workers move equipment between ambulances outside of the Royal London Hospital

But until vaccines are distributed, poorer countries remain at risk, and given the continued possibility of new variants emerging, so, by extension, do the rest of us.

""When we were in the middle of Delta we thought Delta was the end. It was difficult to imagine we could have a virus that was so much more transmissible than Delta that it would kick Delta off the scene,"" said Sir Jeremy.

International cooperation needed to prevent future outbreaks

But he cautioned that the prospects for international cooperation to prevent future pandemics were in a worse state now than before this one.

He said a ""blame game"" that started with the origins of COVID-19 in China but now extends to the emergence of new variants and international travel bans has undermined trust. Trust that will be needed if scientists and governments can work together to spot newly emerging pandemic threats and take action against them.

Emails recently emerged from the start of the pandemic in 2020, in which Sir Jeremy himself thought it was ""50:50"" that SARS-CoV-2 had escaped from a state virology lab in Wuhan. However he told Sky News that he soon became persuaded that what initially looked ""odd"" could just as easily be explained as a natural event.

But more openness about COVID's origins will be needed to help restore that trust, according to Sir Jeremy. ""It's now almost impossible, geopolitically to see this being solved.

""I would call on everybody, particularly, the Chinese government, to be transparent about the origins

After a potentially brutal Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson will attempt to launch a fightback by announcing he is ripping up Plan B COVID restrictions opposed by many of his MPs.

The changes in England, expected after 26 January, are likely to include ditching COVID passports and working from home guidance, although mandatory mask wearing in some settings could remain.

'Red wall' mutiny

But despite the COVID climbdown, a mutiny led by ""red wall"" Tory MPs elected in 2019 is said to be close to reaching the numbers required to trigger a leadership contest, sparking fury among Johnson loyalists.

There are claims that 20 ""red wallers"" are poised to submit letters to 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady after PMQs, taking the total to close to the 54 that would mean a no-confidence vote.

""We're certainly nearly there,"" a Tory MP elected in 2019 told Sky News, blaming aggressive bullying tactics by government whips trying to protect the prime minister for stoking the rebellion.

And a senior Conservative MP loyal to Mr Johnson told Sky News: ""It's very worrying. Support for him is haemorrhaging away. Graham just smiled when I asked him how many letters he had.""

But other MPs claim some potential mutineers are prepared to wait for the verdict of Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray's report on Downing Street parties before submitting their letter to Sir Graham.

Opposition to Mr Johnson is said to have hardened after what MPs described as a disastrous TV interview in which he looked haunted during a fierce interrogation on Downing Street party allegations.

Christian Wakeford, MP for the ""red wall"" seat of Bury South, became the seventh MP to announce he had submitted a letter of no confidence and said several more had written and were considering sending them.

Johnson loyalists begin fightback

Amid the most febrile atmosphere at Westminster since Theresa May was toppled in 2019, the prime minister was in his Commons office until late into the night trying to persuade rebels to pull back.

Furious cabinet ministers loyal to the PM described the 2019 intake's mutiny as ""sickening"", with one minister declaring: ""They were only elected because of him. Most of them are nobodies. It's nuts.""

And another government source said: ""Most of them rode in on Boris Johnson's coat-tails and without him they'll be dumped pretty quickly. They don't know what they're doing.

""They don't realise how lucky they are. They're working against us and doing Labour's job for them.""

The 2019 intake mutiny is said to have been co-ordinated at a lunchtime meeting being called the ""pork pie plot"", because one of the plotters was Alicia Kearns, new MP for Rutland and Melton, home of the Melton Mowbray pork pie.

Later, it was claimed, more than 100 Tory MPs attended a dinner at the Carlton Club, the elite spiritual home of the Conservative Party establishment, where conversation was all about whether Mr Johnson can survive or is finished.

'Operation Save Big Dog'

As he attempts to mount an 11th-hour fightback, Mr Johnson will chair a meeting of his cabinet to review the latest COVID data and Plan B measures before making a Commons statement after PMQs.

Axing the Plan B rules is seen as one of the PM's ""Operation Red Meat"" measures to win back Tory support as part of a plan to save Mr Johnson's premiership which MPs are calling ""Operation Save Big Dog"".

""Decisions on the next steps remain finely balanced,"" said a government spokesperson ahead of the Cabinet meeting.

""Plan B was implemented in December to slow the rapid spread of the extremely transmissible Omicron variant, and get more jabs in arms.

""It's thanks to the phenomenal efforts of the NHS and many dedicated volunteers that we have now delivered over 36 million boosters to people across the UK.

1248;1248;Sarah Everard: Organisers of vigil bring High Court challenge against Met Police;Wednesday 19 January 2022 05:58, UK;[];['sarah everard'];['vigil', 'streets', 'women', 'met', 'everard', 'case', 'high', 'court', 'bring', 'sarah', 'protest', 'right', 'organisers', 'challenge', 'force'];"Organisers of a planned vigil for Sarah Everard are bringing a legal challenge against the Metropolitan Police force over its handling of their proposed event.

Reclaim These Streets (RTS) proposed a socially distanced vigil for the 33-year-old, who was murdered by former Met officer Wayne Couzens, near to where she went missing in Clapham, south London, in March last year.

The four women who founded RTS withdrew from organising the event on 13 March, which was also intended as a protest about violence against women, and say they faced fines of up to £10,000 each after the force told them it would be an illegal gathering under lockdown rules in place at the time.

Image: Flowers and a drawing of Sarah Everard left at the bandstand

A spontaneous vigil then took place on Clapham Common, for which the force came under criticism over its policing before being cleared by a police watchdog.

The Duchess of Cambridge was among the thousands of women who paid tribute and laid flowers at the bandstand that day.

Lawyers for RTS will argue at a two-day hearing that the Met's handling of the event breached their human rights to freedom of speech and assembly, and are asking the High Court to make a declaration to that effect.

The four, whose case is opposed by the force, are also seeking damages for the alleged breach, which will be donated to charity if their case is successful.

Image: Wayne Couzens used COVID-19 lockdown regulations to kidnap, rape and murder Ms Everard

Anna Birley, one of the four claimants, said in a statement: ""We are really pleased to be taking this important case forward.

""When we organised the vigil, we never imagined we would end up in the High Court - we believed then, as we believe now, that we have a very clearly defined right to protest, and that if there was ever a reasonable excuse for exercising this right, it was last March when a young woman was abducted, raped and killed by a then serving police officer.

Image: The Duchess of Cambridge paid tribute at the vigil

""At its heart this case is about the police accepting their responsibility under human rights law to facilitate peaceful protest - rather than their consistent attempts to silence and threaten women.

""Women were robbed of their chance to come together in solidarity to mourn Sarah and to stand up to the epidemic of violence against women and girls.

""We hope that the ruling will help set an important precedent that protects our right to come together in protest and solidarity in the future.""

We are in High Court on Wednesday and Thursday against @metpoliceuk defending our human right to protest and Reclaim These Streets. They have objected to the skeleton arguments being shared, but here is our update on the case. https://t.co/lUu1cSj32K pic.twitter.com/HVi6DmTZJG — Reclaim These Streets (@ReclaimTS) January 17, 2022

RTS took urgent legal action in March last year, asking a High Court judge to make ""an interim declaration"" that any ban on outdoor gatherings under the coronavirus regulations at the time was ""subject to the right to protest"".

But the judge declined to grant the group's request and also refused to make a declaration that an alleged force policy of ""prohibiting all protests, irrespective of the specific circumstances"" was unlawful.

RTS was set up after the disappearance of Ms Everard prompted a public outcry about women's safety.

By political correspondent Tamara Cohen

One argument being used by the PM's allies to red wall rebels is that a new leader may want their own mandate so there could be a sooner-rather-than-later election in which their seats would be at risk.

Coincidentally, politics professor Matthew Goodwin gave a briefing to around 15 2019 MPs on Monday night about his research - before plotting started. It's his contention that dropping Boris Johnson would alienate key chunks of the party's voters.

The realignment being the trend of older, working-class voters backing the Conservatives in areas where they traditionally voted Labour – and seen in the collapse of Labour's Northern heartlands in 2019.

He thinks Mr Johnson's personal appeal to people disillusioned with politics turbo-charged this trend.

Professor Goodwin told me last night: ""If I was a red wall Labour MP who won my seat for the first time in 2019, that victory is heavily dependent on Boris Johnson.

""To change leader two years into a premiership, however badly managed that premiership is, would be a huge gamble.""

Professor Goodwin says that, given lack of evidence, an alternative leader could hold or extend those gains. Given local elections in many red wall areas in May, he advised new MPs to wait for those results.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220119103403/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-news-latest-live-watch-pmqs-partygate-downing-street-keir-starmer-12514080;

Around 12 letters were handed in this morning, according to Sky News political correspondents Sam Coates and Joe Pike.

They were from MPs who were part of a group of around 20 first voted in at the 2019 general election, many in traditionally Labour seats in the North.

They met last night to discuss their support of the prime minister after he claimed on Tuesday ""nobody told me"" the Number 10 lockdown garden party in May 2020 was against the rules.

Several other letters are understood to have been submitted ahead of today, with a handful of Conservative MPs confirming to Sky News they have done so.

The letters have been handed to Sir Graham Brady, head of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, who is the only person that knows exactly how many letters have been submitted.

For a Tory PM to be ousted, Sir Graham needs to receive letters from 15% of Conservative MPs, which at the moment is 54.

When that number is reached, a vote on the PM's leadership will be triggered. There are reports this could happen as early as today.

National Crime Agency (NCA) officials want people to contact them with information about any of the suspects, insisting the country that has long been popular with British criminals fleeing justice is ""not a safe haven"".

They say they aim to apprehend the men - whose alleged crimes also include supplying firearms and ammunition - after a previous campaign resulted in 86 people being arrested.

'Spain is not a safe haven'

Among those being sought is 41-year-old Nana Oppong.

He is wanted by Essex Police for the drive-by murder of grandfather Robert Powell, 50, who was shot eight times with a 9mm pistol in June 2020. It is alleged he and the victim were from rival criminal factions.

Also being hunted is 30-year-old Jack Mayle who is suspected of running a drug line supplying MDMA and other substances in south London, allegedly working with a dark web drugs supplier.

The appeal also features Callum Halpin, 27, who is wanted by Greater Manchester Police for the murder of drug dealer Luke Graham, 31, and the attempted murder of Anton Verigotta.

Graham, a father-of-two, was ambushed and shot dead in a drugs turf war on a street in Ashton-under-Lyne as children played nearby in June 2018. Five men were jailed in July 2019 over the execution.

Steve Rodhouse the NCA's director, said the appeal was being run along with CrimeStoppers, Spanish law enforcement and UK police.

""Spain is not a safe haven,"" he said. ""Fugitives usually continue offending while on the run and these men will be known in criminal circles wherever they are.

""The last thing the fugitives' associates will want is the combined determination and capabilities of the UK and Spanish law enforcement focusing on them.

""Many of these fugitives will be trying to blend in to the large British communities who have made their homes in Spain, and if you are resident, you may know one of them from your town or village.

""Loyalties change over time and we urge anyone with information about these men to help us find them.""

The committee has demanded the former president's personal lawyer - and three other members of Mr Trump's legal team - hand over documents and sit for depositions on 8 February.

In the days after the 2020 presidential election won by Joe Biden, the committee says Mr Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, Sidney Powell and Boris Epshteyn were involved in pushing the baseless claim that Mr Trump had won the vote.

On 6 January 2021, large crowds of rioters stoked by claims of election fraud entered the Capitol building - storming past police barriers, smashing windows and sending politicians running - in a bid to overturn the election result.

""The four individuals we've subpoenaed today advanced unsupported theories about election fraud, pushed efforts to overturn the election results, or were in direct contact with the former president about attempts to stop the counting of electoral votes,"" congressman Bennie Thompson, the committee's chairman, said in a statement.

The panel is also seeking information about Mr Giuliani's reported efforts to persuade state legislators to take steps to overturn the election results.

Mr Giuliani, Ms Powell, and Ms Ellis jointly spoke at a Trump campaign news conference on 19 November 2020 during which they pledged to overturn President Biden's election victory.

Ms Powell promised to ""release the Kraken"" - likening their effort to a mythological sea monster.

A former Trump campaign strategic adviser, Mr Epshteyn reportedly attended meetings at the Willard Hotel in the days leading up to the Capitol attack.

The committee said he had a call with Mr Trump on the morning of 6 January 2021 to discuss options to delay the certification of election results in the event of then-vice president Mike Pence's unwillingness to deny or delay the process.

Robert Costello, a lawyer for Mr Giuliani, described the subpoena as ""political theatre"" and said his client was constrained by the legal doctrines of attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.

""I don't think there's anything here he can testify about,"" he said.

In a tweet, Mr Epshteyn called the committee illegitimate and its efforts part of a ""witch hunt"" against Mr Trump and his supporters.

Stella Creasy's 'This Mum Votes' campaign was launched in late 2021 in an effort to get more mothers and new parents elected to parliament and help address the ""lack of mum voices in the decision-making process"".

The Labour MP for Walthamstow described being ""heartbroken"" by her own party's response to her two pregnancies and unprecedented fight for maternity cover as an MP.

'You're pregnant, not sick'

She was the first in history to get cover in her constituency after her first child in 2019 but is still fighting the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which says other people cannot cover MPs in parliament, after she gave birth for a second time last year.

Ms Creasy also prompted a rethink over parliamentary rules on babies in the House of Commons after sharing a letter advising her she should not have brought her sleeping three-month-old into the chamber.

""I took my baby in not because I wanted to, but because I don't have any maternity cover,"" she told Sky News.

""It's an imperfect solution to a system that isn't really set up for parents to be part of our political process.""

Responding to a call for experiences from fellow campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed this week, one woman recalled being told she would have to use her annual leave allowance to get time off for morning sickness.

""'If you want to start late due to morning sickness, you'll have to use your annual leave,'"" the woman said on Twitter.

""'Is it not sick leave?' 'No! You're pregnant, not sick' (when I mentioned all the unpaid overtime I'd recently done, HR suddenly went quiet on the matter.""

‘If you want to start late due to morning sickness, you’ll have to use your annual leave’.

‘Is it not sick leave?’

‘No! You’re pregnant not sick!’ 🤦‍♀️

Another said she was told her ""career would be over"" when she told a female mentor she was having a third child.

Political journalist Isabel Oakeshott responded by saying she had covered up a pregnancy for six months for fear of being denied a promotion.

""I hid a pregnancy for six months because I was sure I would not be promoted to Political Editor of the Sunday Times if they found out,"" she said.

""It worked - I was the first woman ever to have that job - but it was awful.""

Another woman claimed to have been asked by her boss if she could ""try to get pregnant again during maternity leave"" to ""get it all over with"" so that arranging cover would be easier.

Ms Creasy described the stories as ""horrific"", adding: ""Unfortunately, from the hashtag that we've got, it's very clear that even in current workplaces those attitudes are rife.""

Calls for affordable childcare and shared parental leave as default

The This Mum Votes campaign is calling for universally affordable childcare, so women are more widely available during traditional working hours, scrapping the two-child limit for support via Universal Credit, and ring-fenced paternity leave so more mothers can get back to work sooner.

The initiative also wants to see funding from political parties to mentor and support mothers to stand at the next UK General Election.

In the US, the original VoteMama initiative has helped get more than 200 mothers running for political office up to state level.

Ms Creasy added: ""This is the most basic function that people have in life, to reproduce, so let's try and make it easier to have that life and to have a family life because it's good for everyone.

""Our economic competitors are investing heavily in childcare because they see it as an infrastructure issue. If other countries can do it, why can't we?""

In response to Ms Creasy's maternity cover case, an IPSA spokesperson told Sky News it had increased funding for locum MP's salaries from £50,000 to £60,000 pro rata.

They added in a statement: ""Constitutionally no one can take on the full roles and responsibilities of a MP, who is an office holder elected by the general public.

""Elected MPs are able to attend the chamber, engage in debates, ask oral questions of ministers and vote in parliament.

""It is up to parliament to decide if the law should be changed so that an unelected person can undertake these duties when an MP can't be there.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220119104047/http://news.sky.com/story/mothers-share-experiences-of-work-discrimination-in-response-to-labour-mp-stella-creasys-this-mum-votes-campaign-12519182;

The ""indomitable"" fashion designer and journalist died on Tuesday in New York, his representatives at TAA PR said in a statement.

During a career spanning five decades Talley befriended big names in the fashion world including Yves Saint Laurent, Karl Lagerfeld and Paloma Picasso.

""It is with great sadness we announce the passing of our dear friend and client, the indomitable Andre Leon Talley on January 18, 2022 in New York,"" TAA PR said.

""Mr Talley was the larger-than-life, long time creative director at Vogue during its rise to dominance as the world's fashion bible.

""Over the past five decades as an international icon was a close confidant of Yves Saint Laurent, Karl Lagerfeld, Paloma Picasso and he had a penchant for discovering, nurturing and celebrating young designers"".

As a fashion journalist, he worked at Women's Wear Daily and Vogue and was a regular in the front row of fashion shows in New York and Europe.

His byline also appeared in other publications including Vanity Fair, HG and Interview, and he was the editor of Numero Russia.

'A force of nature'

At six foot seven inches tall, Talley was a larger-than-life character in more ways than one who campaigned for diversity both on the catwalk and behind the scenes in the fashion world.

He had a long-standing working relationship with Vogue editor Anna Wintour and also served as a judge on America's Next Top Model.

Actress and supermodel Milla Jovovich lamented the loss of a ""force of nature"" in her tribute and said she felt ""lucky"" to have encountered him multiple times in her career.

""Andre Leon Talley was such an incredible artist, but he was also one of the most genuinely wonderful humans I've ever met,"" she said.

Belgian designer Diane von Furstenberg said no one was ""grander and more soulful"".

Sharing a picture of him she wrote: ""No one saw the world in a more glamorous way than you did.

""The world will be less joyful. I have loved you and laughed with you for 45 years... I miss your loud screams... I love you soooo much.""

'The afterlife will be too fabulous now'

US costume designer Arianne Phillips, known for her work on films including Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, said Talley was a ""larger than life icon"".

She wrote on Instagram: ""Andre Leon Talley trailblazer, dapper gentleman, fashion editor, writer, journalist with a singular voice - his witty repartee, larger than life icon.

""Always so kind and funny, his contribution to fashion and culture is one for the history books.""

US actresses Kerry Washington, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer also posted online tributes to Talley.

Washington wrote on Instagram: ""The whole afterlife is going to be just too fabulous now...

The Metropolitan Police has defended its handling of a vigil for Sarah Everard, which happened while COVID restrictions were in place, after the organisers brought a legal challenge against the force.

Reclaim These Streets (RTS) proposed a socially distanced vigil for the 33-year-old, who was murdered by former Met officer Wayne Couzens, in Clapham, south London, in March last year.

Under the COVID-19 lockdown rules in England at the time of the planned vigil, people were largely required to stay at home and could only gather in larger groups for limited reasons, such as funerals or for education.

Police could break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of £10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people.



The four women who founded RTS withdrew from organising the event, which was also intended as a protest about violence against women.

All of them say they faced fines of up to £10,000 each after the force told them it would be an illegal gathering under lockdown rules in place at the time.

A spontaneous vigil then took place on Clapham Common, for which the force came under criticism over its policing before being cleared by a police watchdog.

The force said in a statement: ""Throughout the pandemic, officers worked to balance the need to safeguard the public at large from COVID, with the rights of individuals protected by the Human Rights Act 1998.

""Policing of public order events is highly complex and is one of the most scrutinised areas of law enforcement.

Following a five-day search involving homicide detectives, dog units and police divers, the ""body of a child was located in a barrel"", police said.

Forensics officers are examining the scene close to the Colo River.

While the body is yet to be formally identified, New South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb said the barrel ""contains human remains that are consistent with the missing nine-year-old"".

Police told reporters that Stein became the focus of their investigation because of ""inconsistencies"" in his story and that ""special behaviour"" had caught officers' attention.

Christian Wakeford

Elected to serve the former 'red wall' seat of Bury South in the 2019 election, Mr Wakeford has confirmed to Sky News that he has handed in a letter.

Last week, amid the growing 'partygate' claims, Mr Wakeford tweeted: ""How do you defend the indefensible? You can't!

We need openness, trust and honesty in our politics now more than ever and that starts from the top!""

However, with just 10 minutes to go before PMQs, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer confirmed Mr Wakeford had defected to the Labour Party.

""I don't believe it should be left to the findings of a civil servant to determine the future of the prime minister and indeed who governs this country. I think it is for the Conservative Party, if not the prime minister, in fact, to make that decision, and to realise what is in the best interest, so that we can move forward both as a party and a country,"" he told BBC Radio 4.

""You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. In the name of God, go!""

Mr Davis later told reporters that Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby's interview with the PM on Tuesday had been a factor in his decision, but that he has not put a letter of no confidence in yet.

The 'pork pie plot'

Meanwhile, a mutiny led by 'red wall' Tory MPs elected in 2019 is said to be close to reaching the numbers required to trigger a leadership contest.

There are claims that 20 'red wallers' are poised to submit letters to 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady after PMQs, taking the total close to the 54 that would prompt a no-confidence vote.

But other MPs claim some potential mutineers are prepared to wait for the verdict of Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray's report on Downing Street parties before submitting their letter to Sir Graham.

Is the game up for Boris Johnson?

The 2019 intake mutiny is said to have been co-ordinated at a lunchtime meeting being called the ""pork pie plot"", because one of the plotters was Alicia Kearns, new MP for Rutland and Melton, home of the Melton Mowbray pork pie.

Later, it was claimed, more than 100 Tory MPs attended a dinner at the Carlton Club on Tuesday evening, the elite spiritual home of the Conservative Party establishment, where conversation was all about whether Mr Johnson can survive or is finished.

Around 12 more letters of no confidence were handed in by members of the 2019 intake on Wednesday morning, according to Sky News political correspondents Sam Coates and Joe Pike.

1269;1269;Cost of living: Which foods are driving the increase in inflation, according to the latest data?;Wednesday 19 January 2022 12:05, UK;['daniel dunford', '@danieljdunford'];['inflation'];['price', 'data', 'weighted', 'latest', 'foods', 'increase', 'gone', 'ons', 'items', 'work', 'according', 'inflation', 'prices', 'food', 'survey', 'cost', 'driving', 'living'];"Annual inflation was up at 5.4% in December, the highest value for almost 30 years.

A high rate of inflation means that if wages don't rise to keep track, goods and services soon start to become harder to afford.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) have revealed exactly how much the rise in inflation is down to the increase in fuel costs.

But, while the increase in energy prices was a significant contributor, the sector that was most responsible for the uptick in prices last month was food and non-alcoholic beverages, which grew by 1.3% in December alone.

The last time food prices rose that much in the month that includes Christmas was in 2012.

Average pay increased by 3.4% in the year to November, but some workers have seen larger increases.

Overall, annual food inflation was 4.2%, but among foodstuffs, some items have increased in cost year-on-year more than others.

A roasting joint of beef cost an average of £8.81 per kg in December 2020. In December 2021, it was £11.33 - £2.52 or almost a third more expensive.

The price of a block of margarine has risen by more than 30%, from £1.35 to £1.77 while some fruit and veg - cauliflower, pears and dessert apples - have also risen by more than a fifth.

Meanwhile, a pint of lager has gone up by 17p, from £3.79 to £3.96, although wine and whisky are both cheaper than this time last year.

Of the 45 staple food and non-alcohol items for which the ONS records long-term data on prices, 37 have gone up while eight have gone down or stayed the same price.

Avocados are one of the foods that have got cheaper in the last year, by almost 10% - 95p down to 87p.

Self-raising flour, cheese, bananas and eggs are also at lower prices, while potatoes have stayed the same.

How does the ONS work out inflation?

The ONS collects these prices by visiting thousands of shops across the country and noting down the prices of specific items.

The items that form the 'official shopping basket' change each year to reflect how the purchasing habits of the population have changed. For example in March 2021, after a year of the pandemic, hand gel, loungewear bottoms and dumbbells were added, while canteen-bought sandwiches were among the items removed.

Where there aren't the exact equivalent items available at a survey shop, ONS officials pick the best alternative and note that they've done this so it's weighted correctly when the averages are worked out.

Shops are weighted as well, so the price in a major chain supermarket will have a greater impact on the average than an independent corner shop.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed on Wednesday that most Plan B measures introduced in England on 13 December will expire on 26 January.

Working from home advice becomes obselete sooner, as it has been lifted ""from now on"", the prime minister said.

""Because of the extraordinary booster campaign, we can return to Plan A in England and allow Plan B regulations to expire,"" he told the House of Commons.

He also confirmed the intention to end self-isolation rules for people with coronavirus in the coming months - from March 24.

First ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford have also made similar announcements for Scotland and Wales in recent days.

Although leaders have stressed that COVID cases are still ""very high"", Mr Johnson has said he soon hopes to be able to abandon self-isolation altogether in England as ""our scientists believe that our Omicron wave has now peaked nationally"".

Here Sky News looks at what the rules now are on COVID-19 in the four nations of the UK - and what is expected.

England

People are no longer advised to work from home.

From 20 January face masks will also no longer be mandated in classrooms.

From 27 January:

• COVID passes will no longer be used, although venues can choose to do so

• Face masks will no longer be mandated anywhere, but ""suggested"" in places where you mix with people you don't usually meet

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:58 'The government will no longer mandate the wearing of face masks anywhere', Mr Johnson says

Self-isolation and testing

The prime minister confirmed the intention to end self-isolation rules for people with coronavirus in the coming weeks. The legal requirement would lapse when the regulations expire on 24 March, he said, and that date could be brought forward.

Since 17 January people who test positive for COVID in England have been able to leave isolation after five full days - from the day their symptoms started or the day they tested positive, whichever comes first - providing they have a negative lateral flow test (LFT) result on days five and six.

Previously isolation could only end after two negative LFT results on days six and seven.

Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Since 11 January, people who test positive via LFT but have no symptoms are no longer required to book a confirmation PCR test.

People with symptoms still have to book a PCR test and both are required to isolate.

Those identified as a close contact of a positive case do not have to isolate but should take daily LFTs for seven days and exercise caution when mixing with others.

This only applies to people who are fully vaccinated, if you aren't you will have to isolate for 10 days.

Scotland

From 24 January:

• Three-household limit on indoor gatherings will be scrapped

• No limit on the number of people allowed to attend indoor events

• Social distancing will no longer be required between groups in indoor public places

• Table service in pubs, restaurants, bars and other hospitality venues can be scrapped

• Nightclubs can reopen

• Non-professor indoor contact sports can resume

• Face masks are still legally required on public transport, and in shops, hospitality and leisure venues

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:36 Nicola Sturgeon warns against complacency as she announces the lifting of Omicron restrictions in Scotland

COVID passes

Scotland's COVID certification scheme will remain in place, with people required to show they are either fully vaccinated or have tested negative for COVID via LFT in the past 24 hours for entry to certain venues.

They are:

• Late night premises with music, which serve alcohol at any time between midnight and 5am and have a designated place for dancing for customers

• Indoor events (unseated) with 500 or more people

• Outdoor events (unseated) with 4,000 or more people

• Any event with 10,000 or more people

But from 24 January these two changes will apply:

• 20% of attendees of large events must be checked for vaccination status - down from 50% - or at least 1,000 people, whichever figure is highest

• 'Fully vaccinated' status to get into late-night venues will mean having a second dose within the last 120 days - but not less than 14 days ago - or if their second dose was more than 120 days ago - they must have had their booster at least 10 days ago

Testing and self-isolation

From 5 January, people in Scotland who test positive for coronavirus can leave isolation seven days after they test positive or develop symptoms - whichever is first - providing they have no symptoms and test negative on an LFT on days six and seven.

They can leave isolation on any day after that providing they are asymptomatic and have had two negative results 24 hours apart.

From 6 January, people who test positive via LFT but have no symptoms are no longer required to book a confirmation PCR test.

People with symptoms still have to book a PCR test and both are required to isolate for at least five days.

Those identified as a close contact of a positive case do not have to isolate but should take daily LFTs for seven days and exercise caution when mixing with others.

This only applies to people who are fully vaccinated with three doses of a vaccine, if you aren't you will have to isolate for 10 days.

Wales

On 14 January, First Minister Mark Drakeford announced a two-week roadmap, moving Wales from its current alert level two to zero.

From 15 January:

• The number of people who can be present at outdoor events will rise from 50 to 500

From 21 January:

• No limits on the number of people who can take part in outdoor activities

• Crowds will return to outdoor sporting events and outdoor hospitality will be able to operate without additional reasonable measures

• COVID passes will be required for entry to larger outdoor events

From 28 January:

• Wales will move to alert level zero for all indoor activities and premises

• No social distancing or table service required in hospitality venues

• Nightclubs can reopen with COVID passes required, as they are for cinemas, concerts, and theatres

• Working from home no longer a legal requirement

From 10 February:

• Wales returns to a three-week review cycle as the country is at alert level zero

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:06 Mark Drakeford announces the intention to return slowly to alert level 0 in Wales as data shows cases are dropping

COVID passes

Beyond 28 January, COVID passes will still be required for entry to the following venues in Wales:

• Large events, cinemas, theatres and concert halls

• Unseated indoor venues with more than 500 people in the audience

• Any outdoor or indoor unseated venues with a capacity over 4,000

• Any event, of any nature, which has more than 10,000 people in attendance

People can get a COVID pass by getting two doses of a vaccine or a negative LFT test taken within the previous 24 hours.

Testing and self-isolation

From 31 December, people in Wales who test positive for coronavirus can leave isolation after seven days after they test positive or develop symptoms - whichever is first - providing they have no symptoms and test negative on an LFT on days six and seven.

They can leave isolation on any day after that providing they are asymptomatic and have had two negative results 24 hours apart.

From 6 January, people who test positive via LFT but have no symptoms are no longer required to book a confirmation PCR test.

People with symptoms still have to book a PCR test and both are required to isolate for at least five days.

Those identified as a close contact of a positive case do not have to isolate but should take daily LFTs for seven days and exercise caution when mixing with others.

This only applies to people who are fully vaccinated with three doses of a vaccine, if you aren't you will have to isolate for 10 days.

Northern Ireland

The COVID rules in Northern Ireland are still largely the same as they were in late-2021.

• People are advised - but not mandated by law - to meet with no more than two other households in a private home

• People are advised - but not mandated by law - to work from home where possible

• No more than 30 people can stay inside a private home overnight

• Indoor gatherings of more than 15 people and outdoor ones of more than 30 people must be subject to a COVID risk assessment

• Indoor standing events are banned

• Nightclubs remain closed

• No more than six people can sit at one table in hospitality venues, unless a single household contains more than that number of people

• No dancing is allowed inside hospitality venues

• These rules do not apply to weddings and civil partnerships

• Face masks remain a legal requirement on public transport, in shops, hospitality venues and most other indoor venues

COVID passes

From 29 November, a COVID certification scheme has been in place in Northern Ireland, requiring proof of two doses of a vaccine or a negative LFT test within 48 hours for entry into:

• Nightclubs

• Licensed hospitality premises, including 'bring your own' alcohol venues

• Cinemas, theatres, conferences and exhibition halls

• Indoor events with 500 or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated

• Outdoor events with 4,000 or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated

• Events where more than 10,000 people will be present regardless of whether they are seated

Self-isolation and testing

From 31 December, people in Northern Ireland who test positive for coronavirus can leave isolation after seven days after they test positive or develop symptoms - whichever is first - providing they have no symptoms and test negative on an LFT on days six and seven.

They can leave isolation on any day after that providing they are asymptomatic and have had two negative results 24 hours apart.

From 5 January in Northern Ireland people who test positive via LFT but have no symptoms are no longer required to book a confirmation PCR test.

People with symptoms still have to book a PCR test and both are required to isolate for at least five days.

Fully-vaccinated people who are identified as close contacts of a positive case do not have to self-isolate but should take daily LFTs for 10 days - before they leave their house each day.

1274;1274;'Cut phonics teaching': Vital improvements needed in how we teach children to read, say 250 teachers and academics;Wednesday 19 January 2022 13:30, UK;[];['education', 'children'];['phonics', 'teaching', 'children', 'read', 'reading', 'letter', 'say', 'focus', 'teachers', 'needed', 'cut', 'teach', 'evidence', 'improvements', 'way', 'vital', 'education'];"An open letter has been sent to the Education Secretary calling for urgent changes to be made to how children are taught to read, with less of a focus on phonics.

The letter to Education Minister Nadhim Zahawi has been signed by over 250 people working in children's education, including primary school headteachers, academics and children's author Michael Rosen.

It calls for ""vital improvements"" to be made to England's education curriculum, with more time spent on reading comprehension and on encouraging children to be motivated to read and less time spent on phonics.

Image: A UCL study finds there is no evidence that a focus on phonics is the best way to teach children how to read

""Teachers should be supported to use a range of phonics teaching approaches, not just synthetic phonics"", the letter adds.

""Robust evidence also suggests that the DfE should... decrease the amount of time devoted to phonics teaching in the national curriculum.""

These changes, as well as an ""evidence-based approach"" are needed ""urgently"" if more children are to succeed, adds the letter.

'Synthetic phonics' is a way of teaching children to read by recognising that combinations of letters make sounds, and then combining these sounds to spell out words.

Youngsters in England spend much of their time spent learning literacy in their first few years at primary school being taught the approach.

The letter also demands that the phonics screening test be scrapped.

This is a test given to children in year 1 to assess their reading development.

'No evidence'

The letter says: ""Teachers are better placed to decide which resources to use to support their teaching of reading, and how to assess children's early reading development.""

It comes as a major new study by UCL - co-authored by two signatories to the letter - says there is no evidence that the current focus on phonics is the best way to teach children.

📢 Hot off the press!

It is vital that education policy on teaching reading and phonics is informed by the most appropriate robust research.https://t.co/TgCnMQVa8M — Helen Hamlyn Centre for Pedagogy (0-11 years) (@HHCP_UCL) January 19, 2022

Co-author of the research Professor Dominic Wyse, of UCL's Helen Hamlyn Centre for Pedagogy, said: ""The system doesn't give teachers enough flexibility to do what they think is best for their pupils, nor to encourage pupils to enjoy reading.""

Teaching children to read is ""crucial to improving their life chances"", he said, adding that his research shows the current policy is ""uninformed"" as ""it is not underpinned by the latest robust evidence"".

'Phonics provides a strong foundation'

Julie McCulloch of the Association of School and College Leaders said was important that the use of phonics is ""combined with approaches which help children to appreciate stories and develop a love of reading"".

But she added there was ""clear evidence that synthetic phonics provides a strong foundation"" in learning the skill.

A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We are committed to raising literacy standards by following the evidence. Systematic phonics teaching has been proven the world-over to be the most effective method of teaching children to read.

""Since the introduction of the phonics screening check in 2012, the percentage of Year 1 pupils meeting the expected standard in reading has risen from 58% to 82%.""

The spokesperson added: ""Phonics is just one part of becoming a fluent reader. As well as systematic phonics teaching, teachers should also focus on speaking and reading stories to foster a love of reading among children.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220119134148/https://news.sky.com/story/cut-phonics-teaching-vital-improvements-needed-in-how-we-teach-children-to-read-say-250-teachers-and-academics-12519819;

At least a month to restore communication cable

Meanwhile, an undersea communication cable connecting Tonga to the rest of the world will take at least a month to fix, its owner said on Wednesday.

""We don't know whether they are intact or blown away or stuck somewhere underwater. We don't know if it's buried even deeper.""

Latest COVID-19 data from the Office for National Statistics shows the rate for all reinfections has increased since early December 2021 - likely driven by the rapid spread of the new strain.

Between 20 December 2021 and 9 January 2022, Omicron was the dominant coronavirus variant and the risk of reinfection was 16 times higher compared with the seven-month period from 17 May to 19 December 2021 when Delta was the main variant, the ONS said.

The finding comes weeks after the first real-world study of Omicron's effect suggested it has a ""substantial"" ability to evade immunity from a previous COVID infection.

During the six months from 2 July 2020 to 9 January 2022, people who were unvaccinated were twice as likely to be reinfected than people who had their second vaccine 14 to 89 days ago, the latest ONS analysis suggested.

While the incredibly rapid spread of the Omicron variant has caused surges in mortality, the emerging data, even from countries with low vaccination coverage, is that the Omicron wave is less deadly than previous ones.

And the more infectious variant will have increased levels of COVID-19 immunity - improved by the vaccine rollout and booster programme.

Easing of Plan B COVID restrictions in England

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce the lifting of some Plan B restrictions, which were introduced before Christmas amid the spread of the Omicron variant.

The current rules - which include guidance to work from home, COVID passes and mandatory masks in shops and on public transport - are due to expire on 26 January.

According to reports, the PM could opt to retain the mask-wearing requirement while scrapping the work-from-home guidance and COVID passes.

Scotland will remove all of its Omicron coronavirus restrictions from next Monday, Nicola Sturgeon announced on Tuesday.

The changes will see nightclubs reopen, the requirement for table service in hospitality come to an end and attendance limits on indoor events lifted.

The video, posted by Giles Martin, who followed in his late father's footsteps and is also a producer and songwriter, shows Sir George explaining his first impressions of the Fab Four.

After being told about the band, he thought: ""Well, that's a silly name for a start. Who'd ever want a group with the name Beatles?""

But he agreed to meet them and the band travelled to London from Liverpool, he tells his granddaughter in the clip.

Martin, who later became one of those associated with the group known as ""the Fifth Beatle"", continues to explain how he was won over by their ""magic"".

""When I listened to what they did, it was okay, but it wasn't brilliant,"" he says. ""It was okay, you know. So I thought, why should I be interested in this?

""But, the magic came when I started to get to know them, because they were terribly good people to know. They were funny, they were very clever... and they were the kind of people that you like to be with.

""And so I thought, well, if I feel this way about them, other people will feel this way about them. So therefore, they should be very popular.""

Sir George died in March 2016, aged 90. At the time, Sir Paul McCartney said: ""He guided the career of The Beatles with such skill and good humour that he became a true friend to me and my family. If anyone earned the title of the Fifth Beatle, it was George.""

Jamie Lynn's memoir, called Things I Should Have Said, was released this week with the author also undertaking a press tour.

Speaking to ABC News in the US last week, Jamie Lynn Spears said her sister's behaviour had been ""erratic"", ""paranoid"" and ""spiralling"" in the last few years - with Britney hitting back afterwards, accusing her sister of making the comments to sell her book.

Now Britney's conservatorship is over - what happens next?

In a new letter, obtained by US publication Page 6, Britney's lawyer Mathew Rosengart says that Jamie Lynn's book contains ""misleading or outrageous"" claims about the singer, and that she has ""exploited her for monetary gain"".

It went on: ""Although Britney has not read and does not intend to read your book, she and millions of her fans were shocked to see how you have exploited her for monetary gain. She will not tolerate it, nor should she.

""You of all people know the abuse and wrongdoing Britney had to endure during the conservatorship, after initially growing up with a 'ruinous,' alcoholic father. In fact, your own book reportedly states that your father 'spent most of my life in that cycle of ruinous behaviour. His bouts of drinking caused me periods of torment and sorrow'.

""As I have previously stated, having endured a 13-year conservatorship that stripped her of civil rights and fundamental liberties, Britney will no longer be bullied by her father or anyone else.

""Britney was the family's breadwinner and she also otherwise supported you. Publicly airing false or fantastical grievances is wrong, especially when designed to sell books. It is also potentially unlawful and defamatory.

""Michelle Obama famously said, 'when they go low, we go high' and to Britney's great credit, that is exactly what Britney is going to do, for the time being.

""You recently reportedly stated that the book was 'not about her.' She takes you at your word and we, therefore, demand that you cease and desist from referencing Britney derogatorily during your promotional campaign.

""If you fail to do so or defame her, Britney will be forced to consider and take all appropriate legal action.""

The letter is an escalation in their public feud, which began during Britney's court testimony last summer, where she said that she wanted to sue her family for their behaviour during her now-ended conservatorship.

Britney also wrote on Instagram on Tuesday night that she should have ""slapped"" Jamie Lynn ""and Mamma right across"" their ""f****** faces"" when they were younger.

After Jamie Lynn's appearance on ABC News, Britney said she was offended by her sister's comments, saying: ""She was never around me much 15 years ago at that time... so why are we even talking about that unless she wants to sell a book at my expense?""

She also accused Jamie Lynn of being ""pampered"" but later admitted that she loved Jamie Lynn ""unconditionally"".

The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows the number of people with COVID in the week to 15 January dropped 20% on the week before.

It mirrors the decline in cases reported on the daily dashboard, though some people have doubted the drop because of the change to the rules on PCR testing.

But the ONS infection survey gives an accurate reflection of what's going on. It's based on random testing, whether or not people have symptoms.

So the fall in cases is real.

The data has given the government the confidence that Plan B can be safely lifted in England.

There is little doubt that the restrictions - along with the voluntary behaviour changes and social sacrifices that people made in the run-up to Christmas - had an effect.

People who work from home have half as many social contacts as those in the office. And analysis by the UK Health Security Agency shows face masks significantly reduce transmission of the virus.

Soon after Plan B was introduced the doubling time of the Omicron wave began to slow, buying time for the booster rollout.

But even though coronavirus cases are well down on their peak, they are still high.

The current seven-day average for the UK is above 100,000 cases a day. Compare that to the peak of last January of just 61,000 - and we thought that was bad.

And while hospital admissions are down in every nation, they're not yet falling in every region.

In the Midlands they have only plateaued.

Working from home, COVID passports and mask-wearing to go as England Plan B rules to be lifted

So is it too early to do away with Plan B?

Minutes from the 7 January meeting of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) warned that lifting the restrictions before the peak was passed in all regions could result in more hospital admissions.

And modelling produced for SAGE by the University of Warwick suggests if precautionary behaviour declines gradually in the four months after lifting Plan B there could be a spring wave leading to between 1,000 and 2,000 daily hospitalisations.

The World Health Organisation has also urged countries not to rely on vaccinations alone to keep COVID in check.

So lifting Plan B so soon looks like another roll of the dice.

The government gambled on Omicron before.

Even when infections were surging in December and hospitals were under extreme pressure, it ignored more precautionary calls from its scientific advisers to tighten restrictions further.

The increase in cases among teenagers and young adults in England in the autumn followed a fall in infectious diseases due to lockdown measures introduced to tackle the spread of coronavirus.

Meningococcal disease is a life-threatening infection caused by bacteria that can go on to cause meningitis and sepsis.

There are five main meningococcal strains that cause disease in the UK, with meningitis B the most common.

Majority of cases in students

The disease can be fatal, but can also lead to permanent disability and other serious health outcomes.

A report by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which also analysed recent data, showed that in ""autumn 2021 there was an increase in the number of cases"" in teenagers and young adults, mainly caused by ""group B meningococcal disease"".

It added the ""majority"" of cases was ""among university students"" with the number of cases ""in 15 to 19 year olds now higher than they were pre-pandemic"".

While cases remained low throughout summer, there was an increase when many students returned to in-person teaching in schools, colleges and universities.

Between September and November 2021, 41.5% of meningitis cases were in those aged 15 to 19 - a figure that compares with 11.8% during the same period in 2018 and 14.3% in 2019.

The UKHSA report added that a total of 26 invasive meningococcal disease cases were identified among those aged 15 to 24, with 84.6% in students in further or higher education.

In the UK, teenagers are eligible for the meningococcal ACWY vaccine as part of the national immunisation programme, and the meningitis B vaccine is offered to infants.

'Be aware of the early symptoms'

Professor Ray Borrow, one of the paper's lead authors and head of the vaccine evaluation unit at UKHSA, said: ""Students and parents need to be aware of the early signs and symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia.

""If you're concerned you have any of the symptoms seek immediate medical help as the earlier you get treatment the better.

""Students and young people can also help protect themselves against some types of meningococcal bacteria by ensuring that they've had their MenACWY vaccine.

""They can do this by checking with their GP and getting the vaccine as soon as possible if they've yet to be vaccinated.""

Millions of people tuned in last week across various channels to watch the PM give an explanation of that party in Number 10 on 20 May.

Today people were no doubt watching to see how he would perform as rumours now build that there could be a confidence vote against him triggered by his own backbenchers.

I should stress that no one really knows if and when that threshold of 54 letters to trigger a ballot will come, although the mood in the party seems to now be crystallising that he won't be the man to lead them into the next election.

As one Conservative political operative put it to me on Wednesday: ""Johnson won support because he could reach a wider base of voters as the Heineken politician who polled better than the party but now he is a drag anchor on colleagues so it really is a question of when not if.""

This is the context in which the PM came to PMQs, the opening of which dealt him the first of two material body blows as the Conservative MP for Bury South, Christian Wakeford, opened the session by defecting to the Labour Party.

Sir Keir Starmer was beaming, Mr Johnson's benches fuming with colleagues shocked and incensed by the defection.

But that a Tory MP and former councillor crossed the floor to the Labour benches - that is extremely difficult for any PM.

Image: Christian Wakeford has defected to the Labour Party

Labour party sources are telling me this is Operation Domino, implying there is more to come, while Tory sources suggest Mr Wakeford's shock defection helped the PM, in the short term at least, prompting some to perhaps reconsider putting letters in as tribal politics kicked back in.

And the PM did fight back during this PMQs, putting in a far more buoyant performance to MPs than he did in our interview on Tuesday, when he appeared downcast and defeated.

But he was soon deflated once more by the powerful - and dangerous - intervention from Tory grandee David Davis, who became the first Conservative MP to tell the prime minister to go in an electrifying moment.

A Labour operative sent me a tweet - dated 2018 and linked to Brexit - from a Johnson loyalist Nadine Dorries minutes after the former cabinet minister made his move: ""David Davis is ex SAS. He's trained to survive. He's also trained to take people out.""

Image: Boris Johnson is unpopular with some of his own MPs after it emerged he attended a Downing Street party during lockdown

These two painful bookends to PMQs - despite the PM showing some fight - speaks to the precariousness of his position.

The uncertainty in Westminster is crippling, the mood almost unbearable and the relationship between the government and rebels is getting deeply unpleasant.

There is talk that Mr Wakeford was sent over the edge by whips threatening the future of his seat with boundary changes.

One rebel told me that the briefing, backbiting and bullying was only serving to harden resolve and deepen splits.

A Downing Street in freefall and the business of government on hold as everyone watches and waits.

A group of the 2019 intake are ready to put in letters, resigned to the reality that Mr Johnson is more likely to lose them their seats than save them in the next election.

There's been fevered speculation that they might move before the Gray report, but one informed figure tells me ""more excitable"" colleagues have been implored to wait for the Gray report to be published, as any confidence vote ahead of it would be foolhardy. Mr Johnson would win it - and they wouldn't be able to call one again for another year.

But the real question now is whether Boris Johnson, however hard he fights, can secure his political future beyond a stay of execution.

Some of his cabinet supporters are convinced he can, with one cabinet minister telling me on Tuesday night that he's going to face an incredibly bumpy four weeks but can make it to the other side.

Plan B measures scrapped from next Thursday

The figures come hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed England would remove all Plan B measures from 27 January.

People in England will no longer be advised to work from home from tomorrow when face masks in classrooms will also be scrapped.

A week later people will no longer be legally obliged to wear face masks on public transport, in shops and other indoor spaces and COVID passes will stop being mandatory for large events.

How are the COVID rules changing in different parts of the UK?

The PM said it was time to ""trust the judgment"" of the public when it comes to wearing masks and said that their use would still be ""suggested"" in indoor spaces where you mix with people you don't usually meet.

Scotland and Wales are also planning to remove most COVID restrictions by the end of the month, but with rules on face masks remaining in place.

Dozens of fishermen have protested outside Peru's main oil refinery, La Pampilla, which processes around 117,000 barrels a day and is managed by Spanish company Repsol.

An Italian-flagged ship was loading the oil into La Pampilla when strong waves moved the boat and caused it to spill its cargo into the ocean.

Three people have died in Tonga, including a British national, and most of the homes on its smaller islands been ""completely destroyed"" by the tsunami that followed Saturday's undersea volcanic eruption.

In Peru, two people drowned off a beach and there were reports of minor damage from New Zealand to Santa Cruz, California.

Peru's environment minister, Ruben Ramirez, told reporters an estimated 6,000 barrels of oil were spilled in the area, which is rich in marine biodiversity.

On Cavero beach, northwest of the facility, the waves covered the sand with a shiny black liquid, and small dead crustaceans were visible.

Fifty workers from companies that work for Repsol removed the oil-stained sand with shovels while workers dressed in white suits collected the spilled oil with plastic bottles cut in half.

Jose Llacuachaqui, another local fisherman leader, who was watching the clean-up, said the workers were collecting the oil that had reached the sand, but not the crude that was in the seawater.

""There is a massacre of all the hydrobiological biodiversity,"" said Roberto Espinoza, leader of the local fishermen.

Juan Carlos Riveros, biologist and scientific director in Peru of Oceana - an organisation dedicated to protecting the world's oceans - said that the species most affected by the spill included guano birds, seagulls, terns, sea lions, and dolphins.

""The spill also affects the main source of work for artisanal fishermen, since access to their traditional fishing areas is restricted or the target species become contaminated or die,"" Mr Riveros said.

The cost of living crisis is biting so deep people are asking for credit at his fruit and veg stall and he says he regularly subsidises people out of his own pocket, agreeing they can pay him back later.

""People don't have enough money,"" he says simply.

Nobody wants luxury items, he says. He also has a clothes stall.

He says: ""At the moment people are struggling. People are always bargaining to reduce prices.

""Business is very hard. Life is very hard.""

Britain's Bangladeshi and Somali communities have long been among the poorest in Britain.

But soaring bills and the rising cost of food are driving people into deep levels of poverty, say community leaders.

And that's before the energy price rises predicted to come in the spring.

Rooney leading against-the-odds fight against relegation

Having been docked 21 points this season, the team is now defying the odds and fighting hard to stay in the Championship under the guidance of manager Wayne Rooney.

Talk of Rooney being considered for the managerial vacancy at Everton is just the latest drama at Pride Park.

As one of the 12 founding members of the Football League back in 1888, Derby County has known many better days.

The Rams were champions of England twice in the 1970s under legendary manager Brian Clough - they won the FA Cup back in 1946.

The financial meltdown after the stewardship of former owner Mel Morris has left the club in administration and on the brink.

How the fight to save Derby has gone global

Fans in Derbyshire aren't alone in the fight to save their club - supporters around the world have added their voices.

From Sydney, Hilary Webster wrote that her father used to work at the club's old stadium: ""My dad was the electrician for the floodlights at the Baseball Ground. In 1963, we came to Australia, but he remained a passionate fan.

""At 92, he still watches every game and interview, reads all the match reports. @dcfcofficial is everything to him.""

In Pennsylvania, fan Shane Dolan simply stumbled across the club online and started supporting them from afar.

He told Sky News: ""It hurts to think I may never witness a match in person. All I can say is that Derby will fight til the end & we will stand beside them as a family. We are Derby and we will not fade out.""

RamsTrust spokesperson John Atkin told Sky News: ""The idea for our #myderbystory campaign came from the sense that neither the EFL [English Football League] nor the administrators really grasped the sheer human cost that the loss of the football club would exact.

""We thought it might be a good way to send a different message and perhaps persuade them of how vital it is to keep this historic club at the heart of our community.

""The stories shared have been touching, funny, nostalgic and in some cases incredibly moving. They've illustrated how generations of Derby and Derbyshire people have lived their lives intertwined with the fortunes of the football club.

""Most of all, we hope these stories might help give the EFL and Quantuma the impetus to get round the table and thrash out an arrangement that allows Derby County FC to continue.""

An FA statement said: ""The FA is aware of the matter in question and is looking into it.""

It is understood that while the governing body is looking into the matter, it is not a formal investigation at this time.

Arsenal have declined to comment.

Spot-betting allows punters to place bets on specific details in matches - such as bookings, or the number of corners - rather than the overall outcome of a game.

In April 2018, defender Bradley Wood was banned from playing for six years after twice getting intentionally booked during Lincoln's FA Cup run the season before

Wood received a five-year ban for match-fixing offences and an additional 12-month suspension after admitting 22 charges of betting on the outcome of matches and one charge of passing on information.

Face masks will also no longer be required in classrooms from Thursday and communal areas from 27 January.

Restrictions on visits to care homes will be eased further, with more details due to be set out in the coming days.

Analysis: The government's Omicron strategy was a gamble that paid off - will lifting Plan B rules be the same?

The health secretary said Omicron caused case numbers to rise to record levels, with over a third of the UK's total number of confirmed COVID cases being recorded in the last eight weeks.

Mr Javid said government action had ""worked"", but he cautioned this is ""not the end of the road and we shouldn't see this as the finish line because we cannot eradicate this virus and its future variants"".

Mr Javid denied Boris Johnson had ""got lucky"" after the prime minister resisted calls to impose further measures on top of the Plan B measures.

""The central decision that he made which was to absolutely focus on boosters has been vindicated,"" he said.

""That is the main reason that we are where we are today because the prime minister made those decisions.""

Mr Johnson confirmed the scrapping of Plan B measures in a Commons statement earlier on Wednesday.

The prime minister told MPs that cases were falling and the Omicron wave had likely peaked nationally, meaning restrictions could now be eased.

Mr Johnson also said it was his intention to end isolation rules for people with COVID in the coming weeks.

The legal requirement will lapse when the regulations expire on 24 March, but the PM told MPs that date could be brought forward.

Asked by Sky's science and technology editor Tom Clarke about the justification for ending isolation, the health secretary stressed it remained a legal requirement but added the government is reviewing the policy.

He said there is ""no decision on that at this point"" but pointed out that people with flu are not legally required to isolate and we must ""find a way to live with COVID in a similar fashion"".

Mr Javid said testing, vaccines and antivirals will be the ""cornerstone of our future defences"" as ""almost all"" restrictions end.

""The way we are going to do this is we're going to have to find a way to remove almost all of these restrictions and get life completely back to normal but with one or two really big things that I think will be there for a while,"" he said.

Speaking at the same briefing as Mr Javid, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UK Health Security Agency, said case numbers will mostly decline but ""may plateau at some point"".

After talks with Ukraine's government in Kyiv, America's top diplomat said Russia could double that number in short order and launch an attack on its neighbour.

Mr Blinken is now engaged in a three country bout of shuttle diplomacy to ease the crisis. US officials say progress is only possible in an environment of de-escalation.

The opposite appears to be happening with Russia moving more troops into Belarus to the north of Ukraine.

The US is sending further military materiel to Ukraine and will supply more if Russia invades as well as bolstering forces in Ukraine's neighbours. The secretary of state also warned Ukraine to stand firm and united against Russian efforts to divide them.

Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba was sounding defiant in a joint news conference with Mr Blinken.

""Ukraine is very strong. We have a strong army. We have very strong diplomacy and we have very strong partners,"" he said.

The question is what they will find to discuss after the lack of progress in last week's exhaustive drive to find a breakthrough. There is still a gulf between the two sides.

Russia wants cast iron guarantees that Ukraine can never join NATO. The US has ruled that out repeatedly.

Americans say they hope to find common ground on arms reduction, better communication and transparency. Bridging the gap remains a huge challenge.

""I've gone back and I've identified some key real experiences, the riot that I was part of, the looting of a supermarket that I got dragged into, various other minor criminal activities, like trying to steal Turkish delight, which failed entirely.

""It's not to be so naive, it's not to be infantilised or simply nostalgic or sentimental, but sometimes to try and look at the world, or maybe a very familiar or even over-familiar problem like The Troubles, from a fresh perspective and cinema - at this end of my career anyway - gave me a chance that I thought was very unusual from a position of authenticity.""

Growing up witnessing violence on the streets left the filmmaker with ""a guardedness"" which he's always felt, he admitted.

He said: ""I'd say the legacy of personality for me was a guardedness, a desire to escape, I think I escaped into acting, you know, if I want to be an amateur psychologist about it... because some inbuilt fear that being who you were or saying the wrong thing at the wrong time was going to bring more catastrophic change.""

While deeply personal, it is a story Sir Kenneth felt he had to tackle eventually.

""I wanted to try and embody a simple message of - without being too hippy-dippy about it - that you could be who you are, and who you are probably doesn't change a great deal,"" he said.

""This film was about revealing that to me and, in so doing, maybe allowing other people to recognise parts of their youth that are still with them and that they might positively access.""

Seeing the very start of The Troubles unfold on screen is a reminder of the long road that lay ahead before any semblance of peace would be seen in the region. Trust in politicians would be essential - something our current prime minister has been accused of forgetting.

When asked about Boris Johnson's current fight to restore public faith, the director spoke of the importance of political trust.

""To have experienced peace up to nine years old, in my case, and then see what happened for the following 30 years and 3,700 deaths later.

""And then to understand and appreciate however imperfect, and it is, the process that was achieved through the Good Friday Agreement of '98 is, to understand how every single day not only trust has to be won, but that peace has to be won, and the two things are interrelated.

""Lest we forget. It is easy in the busy noise and cacophony of the contemporary world, with instant reactions to everything are required and instant justifications and all the rest of it that we take a moment. This film in my creative life represents taking a moment to appreciate that.""

While written as a deeply personal reflection on his youth, Belfast is also now a critical hit. After winning the People's Choice Award at this year's Toronto International Film Festival, it is tipped to clean up at this year's BAFTAs and Oscars.

Although flattered, Sir Kenneth cautioned: ""Lockdown has taught us that you can assume nothing!

Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was shot dead by an FBI SWAT team 10 hours into the stand-off, and all four hostages were released unharmed.

In the expletive-laden phone call, released by the Jewish Chronicle, he made a number of threats and antisemitic remarks and claimed to have ""promised"" his younger brother - who reportedly died from COVID-19 three months ago - he would ""go down a martyr"".

His brother, Gulbar Akram spoke to him from a police station in Blackburn and attempted to persuade him to surrender, but Malik Akram told him: ""Don't cry at my funeral. Because guess what, I've come to die G, ok?""

Gulbar later told Sky News Malik Akram was on the phone with his two teenage children when he was killed.

Malik Akram ranted about American conflicts overseas and said: ""I'm setting a precedent.""

His actions, he said, would ""[open] the doors for every youngster in England to enter America and f*** with them"".

When Gulbar Akram urged himself to end the siege and hand himself in to the police, Akram said he had been ""praying to Allah for two years for this"".

""I'd rather live one day as a lion than 100 years as a jackal,"" he added.

""I'm going to go toe-to-toe with [police] and they can shoot me dead ... I'm coming home in a body bag.""

He repeatedly asked for the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist imprisoned for having ties to Al Qaeda.

1311;1311;Type 1 diabetes: Artificial pancreas 'life-changing' for very young children, experts say;Wednesday 19 January 2022 22:15, UK;[];['diabetes'];['children', 'app', 'levels', 'lifechanging', 'young', 'sugar', 'diabetes', 'fx', 'pancreas', 'say', 'type', 'insulin', 'glucose', 'pump', 'experts', 'artificial', 'camaps', 'blood'];"An artificial pancreas has proven ""life-changing"" for very young children with Type 1 diabetes, experts have said.

The device, created by scientists at the University of Cambridge, is more effective at managing blood sugar levels than current technology.

And according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the app-based technology also requires less input from parents.

The app was developed by Professor Roman Hovorka from the Wellcome-Medical Research Council Institute of Metabolic Science at the University of Cambridge.

He said: ""CamAPS FX makes predictions about what it thinks is likely to happen next based on past experience.

""It learns how much insulin the child needs per day and how this changes at different times of the day.

""It then uses this to adjust insulin levels to help achieve ideal blood sugar levels. Other than at mealtimes, it is fully automated, so parents do not need to continually monitor their child's blood sugar levels.""

Managing Type 1 diabetes is challenging in very young children owing to variability in the levels of insulin required and how each child responds to treatment, as well as unpredictability around how much they eat and exercise.

Children are particularly at risk of dangerously low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) and high blood sugar levels (hyperglycaemia), which can both damage the body or even lead to death.

How does the new technology work?

This sensor-augmented pump therapy requires parents to review their child's glucose levels using a monitor and then manually adjust the amount of insulin they need.

However, the app, combined with a glucose monitor and insulin pump, acts as an artificial pancreas, automatically adjusting the amount of insulin it delivers based on predicted or real-time glucose levels.

Sam Wright, mother to six-year-old Sofia, used to have to do finger-prick blood tests on her daughter and set alarms at night to check her glucose levels.

But the CamAPS FX app has revolutionised Sofia's care.

Ms Wright said: ""I have full trust in the CamAPS FX app and I feel like for the first time since the diagnosis I can relax.

""You wouldn't know that she is any different from any of her classmates and that is thanks to the CamAPS FX app.""

Working in seven centres in the UK and Europe, Prof Hovorka and an international team of researchers recruited 74 children with Type 1 diabetes, aged one to seven, to take part in their clinical trial.

This compared the safety and effectiveness of hybrid closed-loop therapy with regular sensor-augmented pump therapy.

What trusts are making CamAPS FX available?

All children used the CamAPS FX hybrid closed-loop system for 16 weeks, and then used the regular treatment (sensor-augmented pump therapy) for 16 weeks.

On average, children spent around three-quarters of their day (72%) in the target range for their glucose levels when using CamAPS FX - almost nine percentage points higher than the current technology.

The app also reduced average blood sugar levels when using a measure known as glycated haemoglobin, or HbA1c.

CamAPS FX is available through several NHS trusts, including Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120011636/https://news.sky.com/story/type-1-diabetes-artificial-pancreas-life-changing-for-very-young-children-experts-say-12519971;

""You allow people to work without papers because it's helpful to the economy, but that doesn't face the reality of migratory flows now,"" he continued.

""But to continue to move together and work together after Brexit, that means that the UK government needs to commit itself in good faith, respecting the agreement already concluded with the union, which we will stick to,"" he added.

What is being considered?

Proposals have been floated for there to be a possible second ballot, but only if a higher threshold is met.

At the moment, 15% of Tory MPs have to write letters of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee, to trigger a contest.

Under the proposals, the threshold for a second vote would be set at one-third of the parliamentary party.

Sky's political editor Beth Rigby has been told the aim of the move would be to give the party ""more flexibility"" and make the leader ""more accountable"".

Why is the PM under pressure?

It comes as the PM fights to avoid a confidence vote in his leadership amid anger among his MPs over parties and gatherings in Downing Street and other government departments during coronavirus restrictions in 2020 and 2021.

Mr Johnson has admitted attending a drinks party in the Number 10 garden in May 2020, described by one of his aides as a ""bring your own booze"" event.

Number 10 later apologised to the Queen and said Mr Johnson was not in Downing Street that day.

Claims of more letters

Westminster has been abuzz with speculation in recent days that the requisite 54 letters could soon be reached, but this has yet to happen.

Smaller incursion may not prompt massive sanctions

And pressed on whether sanctions will work to deter Russia from invading, the President offered a distinction between an invasion and an incursion, appearing to infer that a smaller incursion would not prompt massive sanctions.

""Russia will be held accountable if it invades. And it depends on what it does. It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having a fight about what to do and not do etc, but if they actually do what they are capable of doing with the forces that are massed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia,"" he said.

Image: Snipers take part in military exercises at a firing ground of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Donetsk region

He was offered the chance to clarify whether he was suggesting that an incursion would prompt a lesser Western response.

""So the question is if it's something significantly short of a significant invasion, or not even significant, just major military forces coming across. For example, it's one thing to determine that if they continue to use cyber efforts, well we can respond the same way, with cyber,"" he said.

Presidents comments rattle Kyiv and present opportunity for Moscow Mark Stone US correspondent @Stone_SkyNews Sometimes ambiguity is a tool of diplomacy. But often, it’s actually clear language that is vital. At the White House, the President made ambiguous comments which have rattled Kyiv and potentially presented Moscow with an opportunity. President Biden inferred that a Russian incursion might not prompt the same response as an invasion. He failed clearly to outline what his definition of incursion was. It was left to a White House spokesperson to clarify that he was drawing a distinction between 'military' and 'para-miliary'. Remember, when Russia invaded and then annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014 it did so with Russian troops who wore no insignia - the so-called 'little green men'. Para-military? On Friday, I sat down with Victoria Nuland, America’s Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs and former US ambassador to NATO and asked her if there was a distinction. ""Further territorial aggression against Ukraine, further efforts that would destabilise a democratically elected government, any of these sabotage plots brought to Ukraine by Russia are aggressive, are destabilising and will result in firm and swift action from us. We have said that the response will be severe economic and political consequences,"" she said. It is clear from what President Biden said that NATO remains split over its Ukraine response. Something less than a full-scale invasion will, as Joe Biden admitted, ""...cause a fight about what to do and what not to do"". So if President Putin does decide to annex another small part of Ukraine, perhaps using ""little green men"", might he just think he'll get away with it?

'Actions would be met by a reciprocal response'

White House staff later clarified his comments, saying that the President was distinguishing between military and non-military or para-military.

Emily Horne, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council tweeted: ""He was referring to the difference between military and non-military / para-military / cyber action by the Russians. Such actions would be met by a reciprocal response, in coordination with Allies and partners.""

Biden issues warning

President Biden concluded his Ukraine comments in the news conference with a warning.

""We need to be very careful about how we move forward and make it clear to him that there are prices to pay that could in fact cost his country an awful lot,"" the President said.

With stark language, he added: ""Of course you have to be concerned when you have, you know, a nuclear power invade. If he invades, this hasn't happened since World War Two.

""This'll be the most consequential thing that's happened in the world in terms of war and peace since World War Two.""

Equally stark, in a comment that might be lost in one of the longest news conferences in presidential history, Mr Biden questioned whether anyone even within the Kremlin had any idea of Putin's plan.

The woman believed she was exchanging messages with the Oscar-winning actor on Facebook and lost about £10,000 in the scam, the charity Victim Support revealed.

Reports of romance fraud have soared during the pandemic but a senior detective told Sky News they were ""the tip of the iceberg"" as many victims are too embarrassed to come forward.

Almost 9,000 cases were reported in England, Wales and Northern Ireland last year - an increase of more than a quarter (27%) on the year before, police figures show.

Some of those targeted have lost hundreds of thousands of pounds to people they thought they were in relationships with, according to Victim Support.

Lisa Mills, senior fraud manager at the charity, said the woman conned by the fake Nicolas Cage profile was vulnerable and she ""could ill-afford to lose"" the money.

The fraudster behind the account - who is not thought to have been found by police - claimed Cage needed the funds for ""tax reasons"" and he planned to visit the UK, while urging the victim to keep their relationship ""on the low down"", Ms Mills added.

There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Cage whose representatives did not respond when approached by Sky News.

Ms Mills said romance fraud cases involving fake celebrity profiles were ""challenging"" because victims often have an ""overwhelming desire"" to believe they are communicating with the actual stars.

Another victim was duped by someone pretending to be Prison Break actor Wentworth Miller online and still refuses to accept that it isn't him, she added.

Ms Mills told Sky News: ""I think it's hard to convey to wider society - people just scoff and think 'I wouldn't be taken in by that'.

""It's real, it's happening and we have to support people who have gone through it.

""It's more common than people think unfortunately.""

Romance fraud victims have 're-mortgaged homes and taken out loans'

Ms Mills said some romance fraudsters posing as celebrities have sought out victims who follow the social media channels of famous figures.

She said: ""Now the dating websites and apps are doing their upmost to protect their users, fraudsters have to look for alternative means.

""They can go through Facebook or Instagram, sending out random requests in the hope that people pick up and they can start drawing victims into their web.

""Victims may not have a support network around them. They may have no one in their family to challenge them to say: 'What are you doing?'""

Ms Mills said about 80% of romance fraud victims she has supported have been aged over 60 - including one victim who was over 90 years old.

She said: ""In the more extreme cases I've seen people have re-mortgaged their homes, they've taken out loans. I've dealt with cases involving hundreds of thousands of pounds.

""The sad thing is people are left bereft and thinking 'who can I trust going forward?'

""It does shake people to their very core.

""It's a disgusting crime.""

Organised criminals targeting online daters 'on an industrial scale'

Detective Inspector Daniel Parkinson, from City of London Police, likened romance fraud to grooming and warned that organised crime groups were targeting people seeking relationships online.

He told Sky News: ""I think a lot of people see reports of romance fraud and think the victims are silly or stupid - 'how could people fall for these scams?'

""I liken it to grooming. Offenders will groom victims and it can happen over quite a long period of time.

""Criminals can be sat at a computer communicating with 50, 60, 70 people or more - and they are trying to target other people as well.

""We've got organised crime groups doing this on an industrial scale.""

Image: Police say organised criminal groups are targeting online daters 'on an industrial scale'

The scammers - who typically use false pictures on their online profiles - will often claim to work away in jobs such as the military and medical professions, Mr Parkinson said.

One of the tactics used involved fraudsters trawling through personal information on social media profiles ""to work out triggers in victims"", he added.

The senior detective said: ""If you disclose 'my mother died of cancer,' later on that might be the hook (for the criminals).

""That might be the hook for them to say: 'I've just been diagnosed', and they'll know that will resonate with you because you've lost someone with cancer yourself.""

Mr Parkinson said the fraudsters had ""zero morals"" and some victims had been used as ""money mules"" after unwittingly having stolen funds transferred into their accounts.

Romance fraudsters will spend weeks gaining their victims’ trust before asking for money for a variety of emotive reasons.

Of the reports of romance fraud in the past year, 20% of victims were aged 50 to 59, 18% were between 40 and 49, and 17% were 30 to 39, according to Action Fraud.

Half of victims were women, just over a third (39%) were men and 11% of victims did not report their gender.

Mr Parkinson said: ""We've had almost 9,000 reported cases - the likelihood that is the tip of the iceberg.

""Some people are chronically embarrassed when they become victims so they won't talk about it.""

Who's been convicted of romance fraud?

A romance fraudster was jailed last week for more than two years after he targeted vulnerable older victims - including a woman with terminal cancer.

He contacted more than 670 people on sites including Tinder, Bumble, Christian Connection and Plenty of Fish, scamming nine of them between June 2019 and July last year.

One of his victims told him she had been diagnosed with cancer but he continued to ask for money and even sent messages after she died, London's Southwark Crown Court heard.

Another serious case involved serial fraudster Richard Robinson who conned two women out of more than £210,000.

The motor dealer, from Camerton in Somerset, was jailed for 10 years in 2020 after he groomed vulnerable women into giving him money and convinced them to put their houses on the market.

He met one of the victims on the dating website Plenty Of Fish, a court heard.

The private investigator hunting down rogue daters

Samantha Cooper aims to identity romance fraudsters before people fall victim to them through her private investigation company Rogue Daters.

She told Sky News that having used dating sites herself in the past she was aware that some people ""quite blatantly lie"".

""I had a client who had been ripped off £3,000 through a romance fraud and that's where I thought there's a gap in the market,"" she said.

""I think the public's perception is it's normally women who get scammed but it's people scamming both men and women.

""The truth is, if you've got money, a scammer will take it whatever age you are.""

Ms Cooper said the effect of romance frauds can be ""truly devastating"" and she knows victims who have been left feeling suicidal.

She added: ""People will say: 'Oh they are so stupid, it wouldn't happen to me.' I don't think they really understand how sophisticated these scammers are and the lengths people will go to scam someone.

""It's a lucrative business to them.

""I've seen people fall out with family members because one is telling them it's a scammer and they don't believe it.""

Facebook warns against 'sending money to unverified celebrity accounts'

Facebook's parent company Meta said fraudulent activity is not allowed on the platform and it had dedicated ""significant resources"" to tackle the issue.

A Meta spokeswoman told Sky News: ""Most celebrities are verified on Facebook with a blue tick by their name.

""We'd recommend being wary of giving personal details or sending money to unverified celebrity accounts or people you don't know and trust.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120061231/http://news.sky.com/story/romance-fraudster-posing-as-nicolas-cage-scammed-vulnerable-woman-out-of-thousands-of-pounds-says-victim-support-12519794;
1321;1321;Will 40 years of house price inflation see Brits turn their backs on buying homes?;Thursday 20 January 2022 03:35, UK;['amy borrett', '@amy_borrett'];['data and forensics', 'house prices', 'inflation', 'uk economy'];['price', 'data', 'house', 'brits', 'sky', 'buying', 'uk', 'rents', 'rising', 'inflation', 'turn', 'prices', 'rental', 'homes', '40', 'average', 'backs'];"Sky News analysis of new data shows that it is becoming increasingly difficult to buy a home, especially for people in the parts of the country on the lowest incomes.

Rents are also rising, albeit at a more moderate pace, with the exception of London where prices are actually falling.

The price of the average UK house increased 10% in the year to November 2021 to more than £270,000, according to data from HM Land Registry.

Wages rises have not followed the same trajectory as house prices since the start of 2015, but have grown more quickly than rents. The relative affordability of renting raises the question: Will the UK continue to be a nation of home owners?

Krishan Shah, researcher at think tank the Resolution Foundation, says that house price inflation has outpaced wages since the '80s.

""Only 4% of young people between the ages of 25 and 34 have enough savings and earnings to access the typical first-buyer property, which means that a large number are forced to rent,"" he says.

The South West was the region with the highest annual house price and rent inflation, closely followed by the East of England.

Meanwhile, London lagged behind other regions with an annual increase of just over 5% and a fall in rents.

Where are house prices rising the most?

For people in the parts of the country on the lowest average pay, buying a home is becoming especially difficult.

Ceredigion on the Welsh coast experienced the highest inflation of almost 33% over the past two years, despite being in the bottom third of UK local authorities for average weekly wages.

Shah says that this reflects a ""race to space"" as the pandemic has inspired many to move away from the city centre.

""We're seeing people move out of the city and go to more rural areas, which have lower disposable income because they don't have city industries,"" he says.

This can also be seen in the data for different property types, as the growth in flat prices has diverged from the trends in other house prices since the start of the pandemic.

The price of an average detached house has increased almost 50% since 2015, while the price of the average flat has increased just under 30%.

What about the rental market?

New data from rental website SpareRoom shows that room rents in London are at seven-year lows, despite rising across almost every other UK region.

Falling prices in major cities reflect the same pandemic-related shifts discussed above, says the Resolution Foundation's Shah. But, it's not all good news, as rents are already at ""unsustainable levels"", costing the average household around a third of their income.

Matt Hutchinson, director at SpareRoom, adds that renters will feel the pinch from high prices as other household expenses, such as food and energy bills, become more expensive.

""There's a bit of a crisis in the rental market in terms of affordability,"" he says. ""And people are going to find themselves very hard hit as they don't have deep pockets to soak this up anymore.""

Stretching out for thousands of metres, the pristine rose-shaped corals are a sight to behold.

This is one of the rarest discoveries of its kind - an unspoilt reef, not only larger than most others but much deeper too.

Most corals are found at depths above 25m - where they get most of the sunlight they need to reproduce.

But this huge reef, found in French Polynesia by a team of UNESCO scientists, stretches from 30m down to 70m - in what's known as the ocean's ""twilight zone"".

It is thought that being located so deep may have protected the reef from the worst ravages of global warming.

UNESCO's Julian Barbiere told Sky News: ""We have lost about half of our coral reefs in the last 70 years. But this is healthy, it's extensive, and it implies there may be other parts of the world where we have similar coral reefs at these sort of depths.

Image: The team measured the reef at 3km long, and up to 65m wide (Pic: Instagram Lexis.Rosenfeld/Lacaz'a Productions)

""It's really the stuff that makes you dream - makes you understand the treasure and the beauty of the marine environment.""

A team of scientists located and measured the reef using state-of-the-art diving equipment.

Until recently, very few scientists have been able to investigate reefs at depths of more than 30m because of the limitations of traditional equipment.

But divers can now use advanced gear like rebreathers which employ a specialised gas mix to allow them to stay deeper for much longer periods.

Image: Further dives are planned in the coming months (Pic: Instagram Lexis.Rosenfeld/Lacaz'a Productions)

After 200 hours of diving, the team measured the reef at 3km long, and up to 65m wide - with some of the individual corals measuring 2m across.

That makes it one of the largest reefs ever discovered at these depths. It also suggests more unspoilt reefs could be located around the world this far below sea level - exciting news for marine conservationists.

""Coral reefs are very important for ocean health - we know they host about 25% of all the species we find in the marine environment,"" Mr Barbiere said.

""Reefs are also where we can potentially find new species and new medicines.

Image: The discovery illustrates how little is still known about the underwater world (Pic: Instagram Lexis.Rosenfeld/Lacaz'a Productions)

""We are deriving more and more medicines from marine organisms, particularly to treat cancer, arthritis and infections.

""They also protect local communities from storms and tsunamis, and provide a lot of income from tourism.""

Further dives are planned in the coming months to research the reef and the marine life that it is home to.

UNESCO will also work with local communities to give them the tools they need to protect it - like designating marine protected areas.

The discovery illustrates how little is still known about the underwater world.

Currently only about 20% of the world's seabed has been mapped - meaning we know more about the surface of the moon than we do about the deep ocean.

Image: UNESCO will also work with local communities to help protect the reef (Pic: Instagram Alexis.Rosenfeld/Lacaz'a Productions)

The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Committee - which is part of UNESCO - is now working with other organisations and governments to try to finish mapping the seabed by 2030.

Along the way, the hope is that more unique and precious ecosystems may well be unearthed.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120061231/http://news.sky.com/story/climate-crisis-newly-discovered-reef-in-ocean-twilight-zone-offers-hope-for-marine-ecosystems-12519911;
1324;1324;Misogyny 'rife' on football message boards with fans posting 'hostile and sexist attitudes', research finds;Thursday 20 January 2022 04:26, UK;['ian collier'];['football'];['finds', 'media', 'sexist', 'fans', 'sport', 'coverage', 'research', 'message', 'football', 'misogynistic', 'progressive', 'hostile', 'attitudes', 'rife', 'misogyny', 'womens', 'posting', 'university'];"Football fan message boards are rife with ""openly misogynistic"" attitudes towards women's sport among male supporters, according to new research.

The Durham University study found that while progressive views were ""strongly represented"", they were ""not as common as hostile and sexist attitudes"".

The researchers suggest this is proof of a backlash against the increased visibility of women's sport since the 2012 London Olympic Games and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.

One in five women suffer unwanted attention at football matches

Lead author Dr Stacey Pope, from Durham University's Department of Sport and Exercise Sciences, said: ""Our research showed that attitudes towards women in sport are, to some extent, changing, with more progressive attitudes.

""However, the findings are also reflective of a patriarchal society in which misogyny is rife.

Image: In August 2018 Alex Scott became the first female pundit on Sky Sports

""There were numerous examples of men from across all generations exhibiting highly sexist and misogynistic attitudes.""

Based on answers to the open-ended questions in the survey, the fans could broadly be split into three groups who showed progressive masculinities, overt misogynistic masculinities, or covert misogynistic masculinities.

Men with progressive attitudes showed strong support for equality in media coverage of women's sport, with many saying that the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup had been a positive turning point.

Sky Views: Women's football deserves more respect

The fans who held openly misogynistic attitudes towards women's sport saw it as inferior to men's sport, particularly in relation to football.

Some said women should not participate in sport at all, or if they did, it should be in ""feminine"" sports, such as athletics.

There was also extreme hostility towards increasing media coverage of women's sport, which was seen as ""positive discrimination"" or ""PC nonsense"".

Increase in media coverage of women's sport a 'visible threat' for some

The final group of fans, who were in the minority, would express progressive attitudes in public but in more private moments reveal misogynistic views.

Co-author John Williams, from the University of Leicester, said: ""The increase in media coverage of women's sport on both the BBC and subscription channels was openly supported by some men.

""But it also clearly represents, for others, a visible threat - an attack on football as an arena for 'doing' masculinity.""

The study, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), is published in the academic journal Sociology and was led by Durham University with researchers at the University of Leicester and University of South Australia.

It surveyed 1,950 male football fans who responded to a call for participants on 150 UK online forums.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120061231/http://news.sky.com/story/misogyny-rife-on-football-message-boards-with-fans-posting-hostile-and-sexist-attitudes-research-finds-12519885;

The prime minister is determined to fight back, boosted by an apparent split among the Tory plotters on when to launch their coup and on who should succeed him.

Mr Johnson's allies also believe the defection of the Bury South MP Christian Wakeford may have rallied some wavering Conservative backbenchers behind the embattled PM.

The PM's supporters also claim he has bought himself some time, with some of his would-be assassins being persuaded to grant him a reprieve until the Whitehall ""partygate"" report is published.

The report, by senior civil servant Sue Gray, is now not expected until next week and the PM's allies will now exert massive pressure on rebel MPs to wait until then before they strike.

Mr Johnson suggested he would start treating COVID more like the flu, saying: ""There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we don't place legal obligations on people to isolate if they have flu.

He said the government would set out its long-term strategy for ""living with COVID"".

However, senior medics have criticised the decision and said it is ""not guided by data"".

Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) council, said scrapping the measures at such a fast pace ""risks creating a false sense of security"" while the NHS is still under crippling pressure.

""This decision clearly is not guided by the data,"" he said.

""When Plan B was introduced in December, there were 7,373 patients in hospital in the UK. The latest data this week shows there are 18,9791.""

The 60-year-old Briton, who is an ex-girlfriend of the late billionaire paedophile, is due to be sentenced in June after her conviction in a New York court.

She was accused of recruiting and grooming four teenagers for Epstein to molest at his various properties between 1994 and 2004.

But after the verdict, a juror - who has not been publicly identified - admitted telling other jurors he was sexually abused as a child and used his experiences to persuade others to convict Maxwell.

It knocked out communications for the nation of about 105,000 people, cutting it off from the rest of the world, and spoiled most of its drinking water.

The United Nations said that about 84,000 people - more than 80% of the population - has been badly affected by the disaster.

On Thursday, a Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules landed at Tonga's Fua'amotu International Airport after a blanket of volcanic ash was cleared off the runway.

It brought much-needed humanitarian aid and disaster relief supplies including water containers, kits for temporary shelters, generators, hygiene and family kits, and communications equipment.

Its arrival was shortly followed by an Australian Globemaster military transport aircraft, ABC reported, carrying water desalination equipment, shelters, kitchens, and a sweeper to help remove ash from the airport.

Some telephone connections have been restored, but it could take another month or so for full internet services to resume.

New images posted on social media by the Tongan consulate on Wednesday night showed the extent of the devastation and damage: cars covered in ash and homes flattened and reduced to rubble with children playing among the debris.

Rachael Moore, Australia's high commissioner to Tonga, said the loss of property had been ""catastrophic"".

""Along the western beaches there is a moonscape where once beautiful resorts and many, many homes stood,"" she told Australian radio, adding that drinking water was ""an extremely high priority"".

Urgent need for safe drinking water

Marian Kupu, a radio journalist in the capital, told Reuters news agency Tongans feared they may run out of drinking water.

""Each home has their own tanks of water supply but most of them are filled with dust so it's not safe for drinking,"" she said.

""I won't say we are expecting more deaths but as we are speaking the government is trying to fly to the other islands to check over them.""

Asked if there was enough food, she said: ""I can say maybe we can survive for the next few weeks but I'm not sure about water.""

A ship from New Zealand carrying 250,000 litres of water and desalination equipment that will be able to produce 70,000 litres a day is due to arrive on Friday.

The tennis star was deported from Australia on Sunday night, after the federal court dismissed his bid to remain in the country for the Australian Open.

It followed 11 days in which he had his visa cancelled twice, launched two court challenges, and spent five nights at a detention hotel where asylum seekers are held.

In the final hearing before the federal court in Melbourne on Sunday, Djokovic's lawyers had tried to argue against fears that his presence could galvanise anti-vaccination sentiment.

But Chief Justice James Allsop and judges Anthony Besanko and David O'Callaghan were not convinced.

On Thursday, four days after they backed the decision to cancel the Serb's visa, they explained their reasons.

The judges said they did not consider the merits or wisdom of the minister's decision, only whether or not it was lawful.

They said immigration minister Alex Hawke had followed the correct steps under the law, which allowed him to cancel a visa if he was satisfied the visa holder ""may be a risk to the health or good order of the Australian community"".

Decision 'cannot be said to be irrational'

They found that Mr Hawke had reasonably believed that Djokovic, who has not been vaccinated against COVID-19, may pose such a risk.

""The minister reached that state of satisfaction on grounds that cannot be said to be irrational or illogical or not based on relevant material,"" they added.

The judges also rejected the argument that there was no evidence Djokovic had encouraged people not to get vaccinated, saying that the public could easily conclude he was opposed to vaccination, as he had not been vaccinated himself.

The judges said: ""An iconic world tennis star may influence people of all ages, young or old, but perhaps especially the young and the impressionable, to emulate him.

""This is not fanciful; it does not need evidence.

""It is the recognition of human behaviour from a modest familiarity with human experience.

""Even if Mr Djokovic did not win the Australian Open, the capacity of his presence in Australia playing tennis to encourage those who would emulate or wish to be like him is a rational foundation for the view that he might foster anti-vaccination sentiment.""

Djokovic 'not in favour of vaccinations'

""The central proposition of Mr Djokovic's argument was that the minister lacked any evidence and cited none that his presence may 'foster anti-vaccination sentiment',"" the court added in its published reasons.

""However, it was open to infer that it was perceived by the public that Mr Djokovic was not in favour of vaccinations.

Set thousands of years before the events of The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, The Rings Of Power will hit screens on 2 September this year.

The Rings Of Power will bring together the events of Tolkien's second age, and the forging of those famous rings, Amazon said.

The teaser trailer gives away very little information, but we hear in a voiceover a recital of the Ring Verse, which sets out who was supposed to the get the powerful rings.

Showrunners JD Payne and Patrick McKay said: ""This is a title that we imagine could live on the spine of a book next to JRR Tolkien's other classics.

""The Rings Of Power unites all the major stories of Middle-earth's Second Age: the forging of the rings, the rise of the Dark Lord Sauron, the epic tale of Numenor, and the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.

""Until now, audiences have only seen on-screen the story of the One Ring - but before there was one, there were many... and we're excited to share the epic story of them all.""

The first season wrapped last year in New Zealand (where Peter Jackson's film trilogy was produced), with production moving to the UK for the second instalment.

Fans will be transported back to the age when great powers reigned, kingdoms rose and fell, heroes were tested and hope was left hanging by a thread while evil covered Middle-earth.

Mr Davis, a Tory grandee and former minister, stood up in the House of Commons on Wednesday and told the prime minister: ""In the name of God, go.""

He is the most senior Conservative to call for Mr Johnson to resign, saying the PM had failed to take responsibility for his actions over lockdown parties in Downing Street.

""And once they are, the PM will come very quickly back to parliament and submit himself so David Davis, or anyone else, can ask them whatever question they want.""

Just moments before Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, where Mr Davis called for the PM's resignation, Bury South MP Christian Wakeford defected from the Conservatives to Labour.

Mr Javid said he ""was sad to see Christian go"" and admitted it is ""never good for any political party to see one of your own leave and defect"".

He added: ""I feel sorry for the people of bury South, they voted Tory.

""I think a by-election would be welcome, I think Christian would be happy with a by-election.

""Given the people of Bury South rightly voted Conservative in 2019, they wanted to get Brexit done, they wanted to see a strong economy and now they've got an MP that has changed his affiliation without their permission, why not give them a say?""

The Labour Party has said it does not want a by-election, with Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves telling Sky News we should wait until the next general election.

Mr Wakeford's defection came soon after about 12 Conservative MPs, also from the 2019 intake, handed in letters of no confidence in the prime minister.

The PM's premiership looked very rocky on Wednesday morning but many Conservative MPs used PMQs to stand up and express their support for Mr Johnson.

Mr Javid is high on the list of potentials to replace Mr Johnson and would not rule out running.

Scrapping of rules 'premature'

Senior medics and teachers have criticised the decision to ditch Plan B restictions as ""premature"" and ""not guided by data"".

Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA), said the move ""risks creating a false sense of security"" with the NHS still under crippling pressure - and warned ending the mandate on mask-wearing would ""inevitably increase transmission"" and place the most vulnerable at a higher risk.

Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation representing health bodies, said now ""is not the time for complacency about this virus"".

Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU teachers' union, said: ""If you're going to look for the greater of lesser evil, it is a much greater evil for pupils to have more school because they have caught COVID and they have to isolate than it is to wear a mask, so I think while we all want mask-wearing to be over when it is safe, this is premature"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120110212/https://news.sky.com/story/covid-sajid-javid-says-covid-could-be-with-us-forever-but-hopes-all-measures-lifted-by-march-12520495;

The research, by the University of the West of Scotland (UWS), uses X-ray technology, comparing scans to a database of around 3,000 images, belonging to patients with COVID- 19, healthy individuals and people with viral pneumonia.

It then uses an AI process, an algorithm typically used to analyse visual imagery, to make a diagnosis.

It is hoped the new technology can relieve pressure on health systems, particularly in countries where PCR tests are hard to source.

Experts say during testing this technique was found to be more than 98% accurate in detecting the virus.

Leader of the project, Professor Naeem Ramzan, director of the Affective and Human Computing for SMART Environments Research Centre at UWS, said: ""There has long been a need for a quick and reliable tool that can detect COVID-19, and this has become even more true with the upswing of the Omicron variant.""

But he added, ""COVID-19 symptoms are not visible in X-rays during the early stages of infection, so it is important to note that the technology cannot fully replace PCR tests"".

""It could prove to be crucial, and potentially life-saving,"" he said.

Professor Milan Radosavljevic, vice-principal of Research, Innovation and Engagement at UWS, added the new technology was ""potentially game-changing research"".

He said: ""It's another example of the purposeful, impactful work that has gone on at UWS throughout the pandemic, making a genuine difference in the fight against COVID-19.""

Towards the end of last year there were concerns about PCR test shortages in England as availability struggled to keep up with increased demand over the festive period.

The Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance report, published by The Lancet, comes after repeated warnings from health experts about the rise of drug-resistant bacteria.

It blamed antimicrobial resistance for an estimated 1.27 million deaths in 2019, adding that a further 4.95 million deaths were indirectly associated.

Most of the deaths were caused by antibiotic-resistant lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and intra-abdominal infections.

The study analysed data from 204 countries and territories and found that the impact is most severe in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

Around one in five deaths is in children aged under five.

Before the pandemic, worried about rising levels of antimicrobial resistance, British health officials raised the spectre of an ""antibiotic apocalypse"" coming down the track, with concerns routine procedures such as Caesarean sections could become too risky to perform because of the risk of infection.

Chris Murray, co-author of the latest study and a professor at the University of Washington, said: ""These new data reveal the true scale of antimicrobial resistance worldwide.

""Previous estimates had predicted 10 million annual deaths from antimicrobial resistance by 2050, but we now know for certain that we are already far closer to that figure than we thought.""

Very few new antibiotics

One of the main reasons for the problem is the misuse and overuse of antibiotics, which encourages microorganisms to evolve and become resistant to antibiotics.

There are also very few new antibiotics being developed.

A study for the US National Institutes of Health last year blamed the difficulty of discovering new antibiotic molecules, and regulatory barriers.

The Duke of York's Twitter account @TheDukeofYork is thought to have been deleted this week and now leads to a blank page that reads: ""This account doesn't exist"".

His YouTube channel is no longer searchable and his Instagram page @hrhthedukeofyork is also now private, but with 'HRH' still included in the handle.

The duke's Facebook account is still active, but there have been no posts since 20 November 2019 when the statement was made about him stepping back from public life.

Last week, following a US judge's decision to allow Virginia Giuffre's civil sex assault case against him to proceed, Buckingham Palace announced Andrew would have his military titles and patronages removed.

He will also no longer style himself as His Royal Highness - HRH.

The statement read: ""With the Queen's approval and agreement, the Duke of York's military affiliations and Royal patronages have been returned to the Queen.

""The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.""

This now appears on the Royal Family's website, which previously only referred to his November 2019 statement.

The section on 'Supporting the Queen' now reads in the past tense: ""An important part of the Duke of York's role was to support the Queen's work as head of state.""

William and Charles silent

Both Prince William and Prince Charles refused to comment when asked about Prince Andrew by Sky News this week.

Andrew, 61, is being sued by Ms Giuffre, 38, formerly known as Virginia Roberts, in a civil case in New York.

She alleges that she suffered ""sexual assault and battery"" at the hands of the duke on three occasions when she was a teenager and that she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, the late disgraced financier, to have sex with Andrew when she was 17.

The duke has consistently denied any allegations against him and is not facing any criminal action in the US or the UK.

Legislation in New York allows victims of alleged child abuse to bring cases far beyond the usual time limit for prosecution.

What's happened in the case so far?

So far, each side has called for two witnesses.

Andrew's legal team has summoned Ms Giuffre's husband and psychologist to testify about her mental health and claims she could suffer ""false memories"". This has been heavily criticised by Ms Giuffre's legal team.

Aneeqa Atteeq, 26, was convicted and sentenced in Rawalpindi on Wednesday following a complaint against her under Pakistan's cybercrime and blasphemy laws.

According to a report in The Guardian, she met her accuser - also a Pakistani - online in 2019 on a mobile gaming app.

The pair communicated on WhatsApp.

He said she had sent blasphemous caricatures of prophets and made remarks about ""holy personages"" on WhatsApp while also using her Facebook account to post blasphemous material to others.

The charge sheet in court said that she had ""deliberately and intentionally defile(d) sacred righteous personalities and insulted the religious beliefs of Muslims"".

Atteeq, a practising Muslim, denied the charges, telling the court that her accuser had deliberately drawn her into a religious discussion so he could collect evidence in ""revenge"" after she refused to be friendly with him.

Atteeq's lawyer Syeda Rashida Zainab said it was not possible to comment on the judgement ""as the issue is very sensitive"".

Alongside the death sentence, Atteeq was fined and sentenced to 20 years' jail.

It has been reported that the death sentence has to be confirmed by the Lahore High Court, and she has a right to appeal.

In the conservative society of Pakistan, allegations of blasphemy can prompt mob attacks, and the country's blasphemy law carries the death penalty for anyone found guilty of the offence. While death sentences are regularly handed down, many of those convicted often spend the rest of their lives in jail.

According to human rights groups, blasphemy allegations have often been used to settle personal scores and to intimidate religious minorities.

Christian woman Asia Bibi spent eight years on death row in Pakistan after being convicted of blasphemy following a quarrel with a fellow farm worker. She was later acquitted by the country's supreme court and moved to Canada.

Pakistan has long been under pressure to change its blasphemy laws, but the move is strongly resisted by Islamists and Pakistani PM Imran Khan last year called for Muslim countries to band together to lobby Western governments to criminalise the insulting of Islam's prophet.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120123646/http://news.sky.com/story/pakistan-woman-sentenced-to-death-on-blasphemy-charges-over-whatsapp-messages-12520818;

Amazon Style will open later this year in Glendale, California, in the tech giant's first step into traditional fashion retailing.

But, the experience for shoppers will be different from other stores.

Amazon revealed customers will be able to scan QR codes on the clothes to read the opinion of other buyers, and to see what other sizes and colours are available.

Using the Amazon shopping app, customers can send the clothes, shoes and accessories they like through to the fitting room to be ready for them to try on when they arrive.

Similar styles of clothes will also be recommended to them, picked out by algorithms that analyse shoppers' preferences.

Amazon said fitting rooms will have touch screens on the wall to allow customers to ask for clothes in different sizes and styles to be delivered to them.

Managing director of Amazon Style, Simoina Vasen, said: ""We're so excited to offer a shopping experience that inspires discovery and combines the best of shopping on Amazon.com with the benefit of touching and trying on items to ensure a great fit.""

In a similar style to their warehouses, most of the products in the flagship Los Angeles store will be kept in a store room out back, in a bid to create a less ""cluttered"" look.

Palm recognition technology at the checkout will also be used to speed up purchases.

Image: Amazon Style will give customers real-time recommendations as they shop. Pic: Amazon

There are limited details about what brands will be available, but Amazon said it will include ""customer favorites and Amazon exclusives"" as well as ""new and noteworthy"" designers.

Despite the heavy emphasis on algorithms and technology, human employees will be seen in the store in customer service roles and to deliver products to changing rooms.

Prices in the store are set to be the same as online, and shoppers will get recommendations that fit their personal budgets.

CEO of analysts Retail Economics, Richard Lim, said Amazon's move into physical retailing was ""a big statement"" and ""a clear signal that the retailer is eager to test, measure and learn more about how they can leverage their tech expertise in a physical environment"".

""This 'experiment' is driven by the thirst for more data... whether or not this sacrifices the 'magic' of the moment remains to be seen,"" he added.

""Inevitably, it won't win over all customers, especially those that value a hands-on personalised service and the softer human traits that can't be measured by algorithms.""

It comes as the online retailer opened a grocery store in London last year as part of its move into 'in-store' experiences.

Amazon Fresh allows customers to ""just walk out"" as their shop is automatically billed to their account using an app.

While some campaigners raised concerns about privacy, others welcomed the ""frictionless"" style of shopping.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120123646/http://news.sky.com/story/amazon-announces-plans-to-open-its-first-clothing-store-in-southern-california-this-year-12520762;

The baby was hit in the cheek as she waited with her mother in the back of the car. Her father was inside the store at the time.

A pink baby jacket was laying in the street behind police tape after the shooting, NBC New York reported, with witnesses saying the mother ripped it off in a panic as she called 911.

""The officers found a mother holding her 11-month-old baby girl, who suffered a gunshot wound to her left cheek,"" said NYPD deputy chief Timothy McCormack.

The girl was intubated at St Barnabas Hospital before being moved to another facility, where she is said to be critical but stable.

A bullet shell casing was recovered from the scene, but police are still searching for the men from the CCTV and no arrests have been made.

New York's new mayor, Eric Adams, went to the scene in a bid to reassure residents after a number of violent incidents in the city in recent weeks, including the shooting of a police officer close by the day before.

Sherine Ebadi claims that Jamie Spears engaged in ""unconscionable violations"" of Britney's privacy in her bedroom, and had asked others to do the same.

A listening device was said to have been concealed behind furniture in the singer's bedroom, and fitted with battery packs to allow it to record for longer.

Testimony for Ms Ebadi in court documents seen by the Press Association, suggests that Mr Spears had asked asked company Black Box Security, the firm in charge of protecting Britney, to spy on her.

A former employee of the company, Alex Vlasov, backs up the allegations, Ms Ebadi claims, saying: ""Based on my debriefing of Mr Vlasov, I have also corroborated that Mr Spears instructed Black Box to place a secret recording device in Ms Spears's bedroom.

""At the time, Mr Vlasov observed that the digital recording device had an SD card, a battery pack attached to it, and was covered in duct tape.

""According to Mr Vlasov, Black Box was initially responsible for suggesting that a secret listening device be planted in Ms Spears's bedroom, but Mr Spears 'loved' the idea and approved and instructed that the installation move forward.

""The Black Box employee who placed the secret device in Ms Spears's bedroom explained to Mr Vlasov that he did so by duct-taping it behind furniture so it could not be seen, and that he added a separate battery pack to the recording device to permit continuous recording for a longer period of time"".

Ms Ebadi added that California is a ""two-party consent"" state, meaning that everyone involved has to agree to confidential conversations being recorded, and that Mr Spears had instructed the company to listen to others, using methods that are ""typically only available to law enforcement"".

""Mr Spears... engaged in and directed others to engage in unconscionable violations of Ms Spears's privacy and civil liberties, which also implicates federal or state criminal violations of the law,"" the former agent said.

Documents, published by the government the day after Boris Johnson dropped work from home advice and announced the end of the mask-wearing mandate and COVID passports from next Thursday, show even declining infection rates have to be managed.

Before Plan B was ditched, SAGE scientists warned that more than half of infections in COVID waves are after the peak and the long tail in cases still needs managing.

Justifying the relaxation of measures, the prime minister said yesterday that cases were falling and the Omicron wave had likely peaked nationally, meaning rules could now be eased.

SAGE scientists said in their evidence that ""as yet, there is no sign of a purely immunity-driven peak occurring"" in England, or across the UK.

""Peaks of infections have often been asymmetric in nature during COVID-19 with many more than half of infections happening during the population decline stage and so a long tail may still need managing, even after the peak,"" they said.

In addition, several factors - past exposure, vaccine coverage, behaviour, testing patterns, movement around the country, and differences between age groups - ""will make fine temporal patterns very volatile"", they continued, adding that peaks are likely to happen at different times in different places.

""It will therefore be very difficult to identify or project the timing of peak Omicron infections across the country"", they said.

Separate papers showed research by the University of Bristol into people's behaviour.

More than 95% of respondents said they took some precautionary measures by making sure they were fully vaccinated and regularly used home testing kits.

Less than half of respondents (40%) said these changes were due to the implementation of Plan B.

Most people who changed their behaviour said they did so voluntarily, not because of Plan B.

No 10: SAGE did not object to ditching of Plan B

The relaxation of rules comes as the latest Office for National Statistics data shows COVID infection levels fell in most parts of the UK, in England, Scotland and Wales - for the first time since early December.

Downing Street said last night the government's scientific advisers had ""no objection to the approach taken"" in ditching England's Plan B rules.

The UK is understood to have gifted the Next Generation Light Anti-Tank Weapon, (NLAW), which is described by its manufacturers as ""the first ever single soldier missile system that rapidly knocks out any Main Battle Tank in just one shot by striking it from above"".

The movement of weapons came after Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced to parliament on Monday that Britain would increase its military support to Ukraine, which also included an increase in British military personnel on the ground as trainers.

""We have taken the decision to supply Ukraine with light, anti-armour, defensive weapon systems,"" he said.

Operation Orbital is the name of a British training mission in Ukraine that was set up in 2015 following Russia's annexation of Crimea the previous year and backing of an insurgency in the east of the country.

""I remember seeing Girl With Balloon, Vandalised Oils (Choppers) and Kissing Coppers for the first time,"" he said.

""I believe they are some of his best paintings and I love how closely linked they are to the street pieces. As a collector of Banksy's work, you become part of a broader cultural movement.""

The classic pop-art image of Girl With Balloon first appeared under Waterloo Bridge in 2002. A version of it made headlines in 2018 after it was partially shredded at the end of a Sotheby's auction.

Williams' version is on metal and will have a starting price of £2m.

Kissing Coppers, which depicts two police officers in a passionate embrace, made its debut on the exterior of the Prince Albert Pub in Brighton in 2004.

The original mural was removed after being repeatedly vandalised.

Williams' version from 2005, estimated at £2.5m to £3.5m, will be the first Kissing Coppers painting on canvas to be auctioned, Sotheby's said.

The third painting, Vandalised Oils (Choppers), features military helicopters disrupting a calm rural landscape and is part of a series of graffitied oil paintings.

Like Kissing Coppers, the piece is valued at £2.5m to £3.5m.

""These works unite the cultural legacies of two of Britain's biggest stars: Robbie Williams and Banksy,"" said Hugo Cobb, head of the Sotheby's event.

He said the paintings are ""acerbic, iconic, irreverent and unique"", like their creator and owner.

The artworks will be exhibited at Sotheby's in New York and then go on a global tour from Hong Kong to London before being auctioned in March.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120145317/https://news.sky.com/story/banksy-robbie-williams-to-auction-off-three-of-artists-most-famous-works-including-girl-with-balloon-12520866;

The report, compiled by a German law firm, found that the pope - then called Josef Ratzinger - could be ""accused of misconduct"" over his handling of the cases.

Ratzinger, 93, has lived in the Vatican since the end of his papacy in 2013, but he was archbishop of Munich and Freising between 1977 and 1982.

The report detailed four instances involving the archbishop:

• Two cases where perpetrators offended while he was in office but, while they were punished by the judicial system, they were allowed to continue pastoral work without limitations

• A case where a cleric convicted outside Germany was put into service in Munich despite Ratzinger knowing his history

• A suspected paedophile priest transferred to Munich for therapy in 1980 - a transfer approved by Ratzinger. The priest was allowed to resume pastoral work - a decision the church said was made by someone else - and was convicted of molesting a boy in 1986

The former pope has denied the accusations.

One of the report's authors Martin Pusch said: ""In a total of four cases, we came to the conclusion that the then-archbishop, Cardinal Ratzinger, can be accused of misconduct.""

Munich's current archbishop, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, has promised a response to the report later today.

Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said it would evaluate the full report and examine its details.

He said: ""In reiterating a sense of shame and remorse for the abuse of minors by clergy, the Holy See assures its closeness to all victims and confirms the path it has taken to protect the little ones and guarantee them a safe environment.""

A separate report in 2018, commissioned by the church, found that at least 3,677 people were abused by Germany's clergy between 1946 and 2014.

Taro Daniel, ranked 120th in the world, beat the tennis star in straight sets to go through to the third round.

""I'm really, really disappointed,"" said Murray.

""Very frustrated. A tough loss for me that's for sure,"" he added.

The 34-year-old questioned whether he would be back at the Australian Open next year, saying he would like to be ""but not if I do what I did tonight too often this season.""

""This is a really important year for me for a number of reasons and I want to perform well in the big events.""

""Making second rounds of slams is not something I find particularly motivating. I want to be doing better than that. It depends on how I get on this year results wise and how I perform in the big events,"" he added.

The two-time Wimbledon champion had never lost to a player ranked outside the top 100 at a grand slam event before.

His 6-4 6-4 6-4 defeat to Daniel ended hopes he could repeat his former successes after being held back by injuries in recent years.

Murray received a warning for slamming his racket against the court, as his frustration seemed to take its toll during the match.

Raducanu out in injury drama

There were high hopes for Emma Raducanu when she arrived in Melbourne after her historic victory at the US Open last year.

But, the 19-year-old's Australian Open debut ended in a painful defeat when she was forced into a medical time-out after five games.

The teenager seemed to be struggling with blisters on her right hand, wincing in pain at times during her match against Montenegrin Danka Kovinic.

Despite the pain she was in, she took a set off her opponent - ranked 98 in the world - in the end losing 4-6 6-4 3-6.

Raducanu said: ""I thought it was a pretty good learning experience for me. I can take some positives even from this match.

""I was struggling with my hand before the match. There were some people in my team that maybe didn't want me to play, but I wanted to go out there and fight through it.""

The teenager's defeat was the first time she has lost a completed match at a grand slam, having got through the US Open in September without losing a set and pulling out of Wimbledon with breathing difficulties in July last year.

Evans through but Watson's journey ends

British men's number two Dan Evans was given a free passage through to the third round of the men's singles when his opponent withdrew.

He was due to take on Arthur Rinderknech, but reached the last 32 automatically when his French opponent suffered a wrist injury.

He will play again on Saturday.

Meanwhile, British women's number two Heather Watson was defeated in a tight match against Slovenian Tamara Zidansek.

The extremist, who has already served 10 years of a maximum 21 year jail sentence, was described as still a ""very dangerous man"" on the third and final day of his parole hearing in Skien.

The prison term can be extended indefinitely if he is deemed a continued threat to society.

Prosecutor Hulda Karlsdottir said the mass killer, now aged 42, had ""not shown any genuine remorse in court"" and that his behaviour was part of a PR stunt.

'Parole should not be granted'

""In the clear view of the prosecution, Breivik's request for parole should not be granted,"" she said in closing arguments.

On the hearing's first day, Breivik professed white supremacist views and made Nazi salutes while he claimed to be reformed.

Proceedings have taken place in a prison gymnasium which was converted into a makeshift courtroom.

A psychiatrist, who has observed him since 2012, told the court that Breivik cannot be trusted.

'Imminent danger'

And a prison official also said there was an ""imminent danger"" of him committing further serious violent crimes if released.

The Norwegian extremist was convicted in 2011 after setting off a bomb in Oslo's government district and then carrying out a shooting spree at a summer camp for left-wing youth activists on Utoya island.

At his trial, Breivik was declared criminally sane, despite the prosecution's claims that he was psychotic.

He did not appeal his 21 year sentence, but he unsuccessfully sued the government for human rights violations for denying him the right to communicate with sympathisers.

Although Breivik is serving Norway's maximum sentence, he is under the provision of being kept in prison for as long as he is deemed a menace to society.

1373;1373;Climate change: Shell carbon capture facility 'secures just 48% of hydrogen production emissions';Thursday 20 January 2022 17:36, UK;['helen-ann smith', '@helenannsmith0'];['climate crisis'];['technology', 'blue', 'carbon', 'change', 'emissions', 'project', 'climate', 'hydrogen', 'capture', 'secures', 'facility', 'energy', 'production', 'shell'];"One of the only facilities in the world that uses carbon capture and storage technology to reduce the emissions of hydrogen production has the same carbon footprint as 1.2 million petrol cars, according to a new report seen exclusively by Sky News.

In a first-of-its-kind investigation into the plant, which is owned and operated by Shell, the lobby group Global Witness claims that it has emitted far more greenhouse gas than it has captured.

While it has prevented five million tons of carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere since 2015, it has released a further 7.5 million tons, the group said.

Using carbon capture and storage (CCS) alongside hydrogen production is known as 'blue hydrogen' and has been much championed by governments and the energy industry alike as vital to the green transition.

Image: Shell has dismissed the claims made by Global Witness, saying its analysis is 'simply wrong'

Although Shell publishes its broader emissions annually and reports these site specific emissions in technical reports to Canadian authorities, they have not been included in any public-focused communications, which report authors say amounts to Shell ""not telling us the full story.""

The plant in question is located in Alberta, Canada and is part of Shell's Scotford refinery, where hydrogen is produced for use in refining bitumen - a type of oil sands.

'Quest', the CCS facility, was added in 2015 as part of a project to test the capabilities of the new technology.

As Quest was, in effect, 'retrofitted' to an existing plant, it doesn't cover the emissions from the entire facility.

Experts say that more modern, 'purpose built', blue hydrogen facilities can capture over 90% of a plant's emissions.

The report found that this facility captures just 48% of its on-site carbon dioxide emissions.

Once you include other emissions, such as from the fossil gas supply chain, only 39% are captured.

Despite this, the plant has been subsidised by the Canadian government to the tune of $US654m.

""Shell says that its carbon capture system at this project in Canada is an effective tool for reducing carbon emissions.

""Our investigation found that's clearly not the case,"" said Dominic Eagleton, senior campaigner and report author at Global Witness.

""Carbon capture is definitely part of the problem. Because it has a history of failure, almost 80% of government funded large scale, carbon capture projects have failed over the years.

""Instead of investing in this dirty, climate-wrecking fuel, governments should promote and boost investment into renewable energy sources like wind power, solar power, that can take us to a genuinely more sustainable future and a safe climate for all.""

Hydrogen production has existed for many years, but it has become a popular fuel amid the push to net zero as it emits no greenhouse gasses at the point of consumption.

However, it is predominantly produced using fossil fuels in a process that emits greenhouse gas - this is dubbed 'grey hydrogen'.

While there are a few examples of it being produced using renewable energy ('green hydrogen'), at present this is much more expensive.

'Blue hydrogen' has therefore been touted as a good solution in the immediacy, as it is a cleaner technology that can be scaled quickly and comparatively cheaply.

There are only a handful of facilities globally that use CCS with hydrogen production and there are none which currently deploy the most modern 'gold standard' purpose-built technology.

This newer technology is being designed to capture emissions from all stages of the hydrogen production process and not just a section of it, as is seen at the moment. Experts say it could capture as much as 97%.

Shell itself is planning to build such a facility at the Scotford refinery in a project called 'Polaris'.

Some sections of the energy industry argue that it is this technology that should properly constitute the definition of blue hydrogen.

A Shell spokesperson said of the report: ""This analysis is simply wrong. Our Quest facility was designed some years ago as a demonstration project to prove the underlying CCS concept, while capturing around a third of CO2 emissions.

Image: Shell is one of the companies investing in CCS as it targets investment towards a greener future

""It is not a hydrogen production facility. The hydrogen projects we're planning - like Polaris - will use a new technology that captures more than 90% of emissions. Global Witness are comparing apples with pears.""

But independent experts say facilities like Shell's are examples of blue hydrogen and it is right we should learn lessons from the technology and heed warnings about the emissions.

""I call it 'blue hydrogen mark one'"" explains Professor Nilay Shah, head of department of chemical engineering at Imperial College London.

""If you capture what we call the 'process emissions' only you might be capturing roughly half the C02 emissions.

""[But] It demonstrates how to go about many elements of the system. Not only capturing the carbon dioxide but also cleaning it up, compressing it, transporting it and storing it. And from that we can learn how to go to the much higher capture rates.""

The debate over blue hydrogen is prescient because there are a number of plans underway to build facilities in the UK, and blue hydrogen also has a central role in the UK government's strategy.

All UK-based proposals plan to use the most modern iterations of this technology with high capture rates.

One of them, led by energy firm Equinor, plans to develop what it calls the UK's first ""at-scale"" blue hydrogen facility.

The project, called Hydrogen to Humber Saltend (H2H Saltend), will provide the beginnings of a ""decarbonised industrial cluster"" in the Humber region and is part of a larger move to provide clean energy to vast swathes of industry in the North East.

The project is also expected to create tens of thousands of jobs.

""I think that we should be incredibly proud of these opportunities, this will really create an international spotlight on these industrial regions,"" explained Dan Sadler, Equinor's UK VP for low carbon solutions.

While critics say it is wrong to be investing in technology that still requires the burning of fossil fuels and the money would be better spent on scaling entirely renewable sources, he argues blue hydrogen is a practical, positive solution now.

""I think it's the right technology, the right scale at the right time.

""What we need to be able to do is start the hydrogen economy and we need to start at a scale that can justify the infrastructure.""

""You can't jump to utopia, you have to step there. We may all agree that in the longer term an entirely self-sustaining green hydrogen market may be the ultimate panacea.

""But the reality is that the climate emergency is now, we need to be making tangible impacts on climate change obligations.""

Global Witness and others point out that carbon capture rates alone are not enough to assess the carbon footprint of any such sites as they don't include the emissions from the fossil gas supply chain and other related activities.

The UK government is set to introduce a 'low carbon hydrogen standard' to ensure that sites being developed are low emissions although the exact rate of that standard has yet to be decided.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220120171420/https://news.sky.com/story/climate-change-shell-carbon-capture-facility-secures-just-48-of-hydrogen-production-emissions-12520938;

The Jack Russell terrier, called Millie, went missing after coming loose from her lead in Havant, The Guardian reported.

She was found stranded on mudflats near Portsmouth, with rising tides threatening to sweep her out to sea, prompting a rescue effort to swing into action.

Police, firefighters, and coastguards tried tirelessly for four days to rescue her, but were left scratching their heads when even kayaking to her wouldn't work.

The chances of Millie being reunited with her owner seemed increasingly unlikely, when a rescuer had the idea of attaching a sausage to a drone with the hope of tempting her to safety.

The chair of the Denmead Drone Search and Rescue team, Chris Taylor, told The Guardian: ""It was a crazy idea.

""One of the local residents on the beach where we were flying from supplied us with the sausages - I think they were from Aldi. The woman cooked them up for us and we attached them with string.""

Luckily, the pork-dangling plan worked, with the terrier following the sausage towards her rescuers, away from the rising tides, to safety.

'The last resort'

""If we hadn't... got her away from that area the tide would have come in and she would have been at risk of drowning,"" said Mr Taylor.

""It was something we had never tried before - the sausages were the last resort.""

Mr Taylor said it was a rescue method teams facing the same challenge in the future might want to try.

He said: ""We certainly would consider using sausages again: every dog and search operation is always going to be different, but if we were ever in a similar situation again we would employ the same methods to lure the dog.""

Ran away a second time

The maximum take-off weight of the drone had to be checked before attaching the sausage to it to make sure it would fly.

Once on higher ground, Millie ran away a second time, leaving her owner Emma Oakes worried once again for her safety.

The pet was eventually found inland from the marsh and ran into the arms of her owner's father when she was found.

His announcement that he was crossing the floor just before Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday came as a shock to many, but he is believed to have been in talks with the Opposition since October.

Mr Wakeford said the ""partygate"" scandal confirmed his decision after ""many months"" of sleepless nights over the government's decisions, from free schools meals and Universal Credit to the Owen Paterson affair and lockdown parties.

His defection has raised questions over whether there will be a by-election but, due to the rules it is unlikely.

Does an MP defecting automatically trigger a by-election?

No. There are no rules requiring a by-election if an MP crosses the floor.

But other parts of the Labour Party think there should be a by-election, with the left-wing section Momentum calling for one as they do not think Mr Wakeford should be in the party.

Joshua Harcup, youth officer for Bury South's Labour Party, is pushing for Mr Wakeford to call a by-election as it is ""about democracy"".

He told Sky News: ""I think it's positive that he's changed his mind but as you can see from some of the Whatsapp messages leaked yesterday, he's made some comments which are abusive about the Labour Party.

""I would like him to apologise. He would not get my support as our candidate as he doesn't share Labour values.""

History shows by-elections after a defection are a huge risk Tamara Cohen Political correspondent @tamcohen Defections are very rare, and the MP who ""crosses the floor"" often ends up mistrusted by their old colleagues and new comrades. Holding a by-election is not required, unless the MP decides to do so. This precedent was set in 2014 when Tory MPs Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless defected in quick succession to UKIP and both held their seats in by-elections. But it's a huge risk and arguably stopped others joining them. None of the famous Tory to Labour defectors – pro-EU Tory Quentin Davies to Labour in 2007, Alan Howarth to Labour on the eve of its conference in 1995 in a blow to John Major, or Shaun Woodward, a Tory shadow minister to New Labour in 1999, held by-elections. Tory cabinet ministers are publicly calling for a by-election, but with a majority of 402 in a seat held by Labour since 1997, senior figures privately concede it's not a contest they are eager for.

Do the Conservatives want a by-election?

Yes.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News he would be ""very happy with a by-election"".

He added: ""I think given that the people of Bury South rightly voted Conservative in 2019, they wanted to get Brexit done, they want to see a strong economy and all of that, and now they've got an MP that has changed his affiliation without their permission, why not give them a say?""

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also backed a by-election in Bury South, telling ITV Mr Wakeford ""should front up to his constituents"".

Does Mr Wakeford want a by-election?

He has not said either way since his defection.

However, in 2020, the MP co-sponsored and backed a bill that would enable constituents to recall their MP and call a by-election if they ""voluntarily change their political party affiliation"".

Speaking on Thursday, the US leader said he has been ""absolutely clear with President Putin"" that ""if any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion"".

That invasion, he said, would be met with a ""severe and coordinated economic response,"" which has been ""laid out very clearly with President Putin"".

He also acknowledged that Russia could ""use measures other than overt military actions,"" and referenced the incursion into the Donbas region, where ""grey zone attacks"" were undertaken by ""Russian soldiers not wearing Russian uniform"".

Mr Biden appeared to be clarifying the confusion around the position of America and it's NATO allies after he was heavily criticised for saying a ""minor incursion"" would elicit a lesser response.

The US Treasury Department has also levied new sanctions against four Ukrainian officials, including two current members of parliament, who they say are part of the Russian influence effort to set the pretext for an invasion.

The sanctions name parliamentarians Taras Kozak and Oleh Voloshyn and two former government officials.

According to the government, all four have been involved in disinformation efforts by Russia's federal security service, the FSB.

'Russia looking for excuse to invade Ukraine' - but US insists week of diplomacy has not failed

Image: President Joe Biden has warned Russia not to invade Ukraine

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is preparing to meet his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, in Geneva on Friday, in a bid to ease tensions between the country and the West.

However, talks seem likely to fail and the US diplomat said: ""These are difficult issues we are facing and resolving them won't happen quickly.

""I certainly don't expect we'll solve them in Geneva tomorrow.""

Meanwhile, Mr Biden appeared convinced Russia would mount an attack, and said on Thursday: ""My guess is he will move in; he has to do something.""

However, he warned that Mr Putin would pay a ""dear price"" in lives lost and a possible cut off from the global banking system if he does.

On Thursday, Russia announced sweeping naval drills in several parts of the world and claims the West is plotting ""provocations"" in neighbouring Ukraine.

An estimated 100,000 Russian troops are now believed to be on the border with Ukraine as part of massive joint war games with Belarus, which will involve more than 140 warships and 60 aircraft.

Analysis: Biden swift to clarify confusing and contradictory remarks Mark Stone US correspondent @Stone_SkyNews The White House was swift to clarify the comments made by President Biden and the president himself has now sought to provide his own clarity. It’s no wonder clarity was needed. His original words on Wednesday evening were confused, contradictory and dangerously undermined any pretence of Western and NATO unity. With his comments - in which he publically drew a distinction between invasion and incursion (which he didn’t define) and admitted divisions within NATO - he caused enough angst in Kyiv to prompt the Ukrainian President to speak up. In making the comments, President Biden will also have sent a confirmatory message to President Putin that there isn’t a real, united conviction among western leaders. Even his clarifying comments prompt further questions. He seemed to suggest that a repeat of the Crimea playbook, with ‘Little Green Men’ (Russian troops without their insignia) taking over a part of Ukraine, would prompt a lesser response from the West and not the stinging sanctions. Did he mean that? It’s not clear. The broad point is this - President Putin is seeing confirmation of what he suspected and wanted to test: the unity and resolve among the West isn't all that strong. As things stand, Putin probably thinks he can threaten to invade and get concessions from the West in response, or he can go ahead with a small Crimea-style invasion (with those little green men again) and get away with it. Remarkable.

""The drills are intended to practice navy and air force action to protect Russian national interests in the world's oceans and to counter military threats to the Russian Federation,"" the Russian ministry said.

In response, Britain's armed forces have flown thousands of anti-tank weapons to the former Soviet satellite state amid fears of an imminent invasion of Ukraine.

From midday on Friday, people will no longer be restricted to table service and sitting in groups of six at restaurants, pubs and bars.

The current three-household limit on gatherings inside private homes will also be scrapped, but no more than 30 people will be allowed to stay overnight.

What are the coronavirus rules around the UK?

Northern Ireland's Department of Health has also agreed to change its self-isolation period to five days - providing people have negative lateral flow test results on days five and six - in line with the rest of the UK from Friday.

The guidance on working from home will be relaxed to working remotely ""where you can"", while people will no longer be required to prove they are exempt from wearing a face mask in public spaces.

From 26 January, nightclubs will be able to reopen and vaccine passports will no longer be required to attend venues like pubs, restaurants and cinemas.

They will remain a requirement for nightclubs and indoor events that are unseated or partially seated with 500 or more people.

Social distancing requirements in offices and other workplaces will also be lifted next Wednesday.

Further changes could happen next month

Announcing the changes on Thursday, the executive said the new measures would be reviewed again on 10 February.

Further changes could include removing the requirements on face coverings in public spaces, guidance on lateral flow testing before socialising and the rules around test and trace.

Nightclubs and indoor events have been banned in Northern Ireland since 26 December in a bid to curb COVID cases as the Omicron variant spread through the UK.

Dancing has also been banned in hospitality venues.

'Pandemic not over - but Omicron has peaked'

Speaking ahead of the announcement, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said that while the pandemic was not over, the new variant has peaked in Northern Ireland.

She said: ""The pandemic is far from over but we are cautiously optimistic.

""We believe we are through the peak and we believe we have some space now to be able to reverse the protections that we put in place over the course of the last number of weeks.

A large number of MPs, possibly a majority, are unhappy with Boris Johnson's premiership.

However they are unsure when to defenestrate him, how to do so, and - most importantly of all - who should replace him.

Sue Gray report: When is inquiry due, what does it mean for Boris Johnson and who decides what happens next?

Many MPs will tell you that the defection of Bury South MP Christian Wakeford has eased pressure on the prime minister - it is certainly true it has provided a new and helpful rallying point for Mr Johnson.

However this does not alter the fact most continue to wait for the report by Mr Johnson's top official, Sue Gray, into the 15 or so parties in Downing Street including the one the PM attended.

At that point, some will put in letters of no confidence whatever it says, some will judge his fate on the report and some will man the barricades to defend him.

A vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson remains a distinct possibility at this point.

But will this resolve the question of Mr Johnson's future?

If he loses, he is out. If he wins, the scale of the revolt against him could still prove ultimately fatal: Theresa May won her vote of no confidence by 200-117 in December 2018, and she was out six months later.

A growing Tory civil war could also hamper Mr Johnson's reset if he wins a vote of no confidence.

The pain is etched on her face and she groans as she is lifted on to her bed by the paramedics who have brought her here.

Sheila is the 120th emergency patient to be seen by the Royal Preston Hospital.

And it is only two o'clock in the afternoon.

She has ongoing issues with her spine and needs chronic pain management.

Image: Sheila Yates was the 120th emergency patient to be seen by the hospital by 2pm

Not far from Sheila is Muriel Hargreaves. Muriel tells me she is 88 and a half years old.

The half she says is important. Muriel has been admitted to hospital with high blood pressure. It is giving her problems with her heart.

She says: ""It's a certain problem that I'm having with my heart. They've not named it yet because they've not come to a final conclusion.

""But they're doing everything possible to get to the bottom before…before I go home.""

Muriel has been here for more than 24 hours. She should be in a bed on a ward but there is no space.

That means all the investigations to find out what is wrong with her have to be carried out in the emergency department.

It is not ideal but it is the only way to make sure she receives the same care and treatment.

Image: Muriel Hargreaves has been admitted to hospital with high blood pressure

Samantha Wright is the emergency department nurse who is looking after Muriel.

'Not missing out on care'

She tells me: ""She's not missing out on any care at all. Normally, the investigations that are carried out on the ward, ie the speciality that she's under, would normally review her on the ward and put a plan in place.

""But unfortunately due to there being no beds in medicine which Muriel requires at the moment... all those investigations have happened here in the emergency department.""

Andy Curran is a consultant in emergency medicine and he began his career here at the Royal Preston Hospital 25 years ago.

One of the most challenging winters

In that time he has seen many difficult winters. But this is one of his most challenging.

""Each time that we think things can't get any harder they seem to do, and the patients that have been coming through have been coming through in increasing numbers,"" he said.

Mr Curran told me the patients who were coming in were much sicker because they had delayed treatment.

These patients, he said, were ""going up and up"".

Eleven-year-old Katrina Ward is typical of the patients who are presenting later. She has suspected appendicitis and has been in pain for the last month.

She came into hospital when she fell sick at school this morning.

""I was going to school,"" Katrina said. ""But it was already painful before I went, it was just like a normal morning, and I got to school and it got really painful so I decided to call my mum.""

On the hospital grounds, construction for one of the regional Nightingale surge hubs is continuing.

Image: A Nightingale surge hub is being constructed on the site of the hospital just in case coronavirus cases dramatically rise

It will provide extra capacity in case of a surge in Omicron admissions.

That surge did not materialise in numbers that could overwhelm the NHS and the prime minister has lifted Plan B restrictions because of the falling COVID infections.

Will the gamble pay off? Plan B rules to end - but is it too soon?

Kevin McGee, chief executive of the trust which manages the Royal Preston Hospital, says the hub is an important safety net should there be another wave.

""The Nightingale surgery if we don't use that, I would say that is success, it's a facility should it be needed. It's an insurance policy, and it's the right thing to do. So we are planning for the worst, but clearly hoping for the best.""

Those who cannot prove their vaccination status after being asked in writing to do so will be fined up to €600 (£498).

Pregnant women, people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, and those who have recovered from the virus in the past six months will be exempt.

Officials have said the measure is necessary as vaccination rates remain low.

As of Wednesday, 71.8% of the country's 8.9 million population was considered fully vaccinated.

MPs voted 137 to 33 on Thursday in favour of the mandate, which will apply to all adults aged 18 and over.

The bill must now pass the upper house of Austria's parliament and be signed by President Alexander Van der Bellen - steps which are seen as formalities.

Health minister Wolfgang Mueckstein, speaking in parliament on Thursday, called the measure a ""big and, for the first time, also lasting step"" in Austria's fight against the pandemic.

However, it was ""not enough to reverse negative international security threats"", it said.

US relations with China and Russia ""remain tense"", with the countries developing hypersonic missiles and engaging in ""nuclear modernisation and expansion efforts"".

'It didn't sit comfortably'

Speaking on Thursday, Mr Wakeford said the ""threat"" left him questioning his position in the Conservative Party.

A Labour source has said the vote related to free school meals.

""I was threatened that I would not get the school for Radcliffe if I did not vote in one particular way,"" Mr Wakeford said.

""This is a town that's not had a high school for the best part of 10 years, and how would you feel when holding back the regeneration of a town for a vote?

""It didn't sit comfortably and that was when I was really starting to question my place, where I was, and ultimately where I am now.""

The Manchester Evening News reported in February 2021 that the ""long awaited high school in Radcliffe"" had been given the green light by ministers as one of four new free schools in Greater Manchester.

Bury county councillor Mike Smith, who represents Radcliffe West, said a request for planning permission for the school was due to be submitted early this year.

The first intake of pupils is expected in September 2024.

'Incredibly warm welcome'

Speaking alongside Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves at an event in Bury, Mr Wakeford said his new party was ""ready to provide an alternative government that this country can be proud of and deserves, and certainly not to be embarrassed by, and this is one of the reasons why I'm here today"".

He told reporters after the speech that he had been given an ""incredibly warm welcome"" from the party and said any former Tory colleagues thinking about following his lead should ""give me a shout"".

Mr Wakeford's claim of a threat comes after a senior Conservative MP alleged fellow Tories who want the PM to resign have been intimidated by party whips.

Mr Wakeford had been one of the Tory MPs who submitted a letter of no confidence in Mr Johnson and was said to have been ""hauled"" in by the Tory chief whip the night before he defected.

In March 2020, the government ordered Greater Manchester Combined Authority to implement a plan to bring air quality to within legal limits.

Some 1,200 premature deaths every year in Greater Manchester are linked to air pollution.

But on Thursday, the Greater Manchester Air Quality Administration Committee said an urgent review was needed by the government into the plan's funding.

Greater Manchester's Clean Air Zone, due to be introduced in phases from the end of May this year, would see the worst-polluting vehicles charged up to £70 a day to drive in the area.

But the committee said global vehicle-supply chain issues, rising inflation and post-COVID economic recovery was making it difficult for businesses to source greener, affordable vehicles.

Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, said he was ""pleased"" by the decision, adding ""it is impossible to proceed on the current basis without causing real hardship to some of our residents"".

""It's about getting to clean air as quickly as we can,"" Mr Burnham told Sky News, ""but enabling people to come with us on that journey so that greener really is fairer"".

Image: Andy Burnham praised the move

Sky News spoke to several businesses who said they were pleased by the move.

Jade Hutchinson is a small-flock sheep farmer in Bolton.

Under the current rules, she would have to pay up £70 extra a week to use her second-hand pick-up truck.

Image: Jade Hutchinson told Sky News the new charge was 'penalising people for working'

Ms Hutchinson told Sky News the new charge was ""penalising people for working"".

The charges, she says, would mean her small businesses would not be viable.

""If these leaders are thinking about lives, they shouldn't be affecting people's lives by charging them and taking their livelihoods away from them,"" she said.

But Julia Kovaliova, who lives with her three children near one of Manchester's most polluted roads, said that any delay was putting health at risk.

""My 12-year old, Maksim, has asthma that I believe was caused by growing up next to such a polluted road,"" Ms Kovaliova told Sky News.

""I know this is a sensitive issue, when people say their jobs are going to suffer, but city centres are not safe for children right now and we have to do something about it.""

Data shows that 152 areas across Greater Manchester have levels of air pollution that are unsafe and illegal, according to World Health Organisation standards.

The Duke of Cambridge, who was 15 when his mother Princess Diana died in 1997, also told 11-year-old Deacon Glover: ""I know how you feel.""

The boy's mother, Grace Taylor, died last year aged 28.

William and the Duchess of Cambridge spent about 15 minutes talking to Deacon and his great-grandmother, Carole Ellis, during a visit to Church on the Street in Burnley, Lancashire.

William, 39, an Aston Villa fan, chatted to Deacon about football, but the youngster, who was wearing a Burnley shirt, seemed unimpressed at first.

""He thought it was a footballer coming here so he was gutted when he found out it was William and Kate,"" one volunteer at the centre said.

William and Deacon talked about Burnley FC

But gradually he became chattier, as William asked him about Burnley FC's prospects and pointed out that his father, the Prince of Wales, was a supporter of the club after directing some of his charities to work in the town.

""I only found out a few years ago that my dad is a Burnley fan,"" he said.

He told Deacon and his great-grandmother that he hoped his own children would follow him in supporting Aston Villa. ""I need to spread the love a bit,"" he said.

The royal couple also posed for photographs with other families and Kate found herself holding a three-and-a-half-month-old girl.

She cooed at Anastasia Barrie while standing beside her parents Trudi, a volunteer, and Alastair Barrie, who is on the centre's committee.

The duke and duchess had asked to visit the centre after watching a television report in December about its work with Burnley's most vulnerable people during the coronavirus pandemic and finding it ""very moving"".

Pastor Mick Fleming set up Church on the Street in 2019 to help the homeless and disadvantaged living in Burnley and surrounding areas.

Housed in a former gym and funded by donations, it provides a food bank, clothing bank, hot showers, laundry, a cafe, recovery groups, addiction and mental health support, access to a qualified counsellor, and a safe space for up to 200 people at any one time.

'I'm very grateful to the royal couple'

Pastor Mick, who leads church services, said he hoped the visit would help provide extra support for the people using his services.

Mark Drakeford said the country has ""passed the Omicron peak"" and can keep lifting restrictions as part of its ""careful and phased plan"".

Latest data shows COVID-19 cases are falling back to levels similar to those in the autumn and there has been a reduction in patients in hospital with the virus.

The first minister said: ""We remain cautiously confident the public health situation is heading in the right direction and next week we will be able to complete the move to alert level zero, unless the situation changes for the worse.

""We are in this position thanks to the efforts of everyone in Wales and our fantastic vaccination programme.

""It is important that everyone continues to follow the rules and the guidance to help keep themselves and their loved ones safe, including taking up the offer of a booster vaccine if they haven't already done so.""

What is being planned for COVID restrictions in Wales?

From Friday, Wales will move to alert level zero for all outdoor activities.

This means there will be no limits on the number of people who can take part in outdoor activities, while crowds will be allowed at outdoor sporting events once more.

Outdoor hospitality will also be able to operate without additional reasonable measures, such as the rule of six and two-metre social distancing.

COVID passes will still be required for entry to larger outdoor events of more than 4,000 people if unseated and over 10,000 people if seated.

From 28 January, the plan is for Wales to complete the move to alert level zero.

This will mean working from home will no longer be a legal requirement, while the rule of six will be removed in hospitality, cinemas and theatres.

Social distancing requirements in workplaces and places open to the public will be scrapped.

In a letter to Ms Trump, politicians say they are seeking her voluntary cooperation and want to talk to her in early February about the events leading up to and during the insurrection on 6 January 2021.

The US House of Representatives committee believes she was in direct contact with her father, former US President Donald Trump, during key moments when his supporters stormed the Capitol to try to stop the certification of Joe Biden's presidential win.

As one of his advisers, she was also ""present in the Oval Office"" for key conversations, the panel said.

The committee said it also wants to find out what she knows about her father's efforts to pressure then-vice president Mike Pence to reject the 2020 election results.

The panel said this includes a telephone call she witnessed between them on the morning of the riot.

Keith Kellogg, who was Mr Pence's national security adviser, allegedly told investigators he was there and heard Mr Trump question whether Mr Pence had the courage to delay the congressional counting of the electoral votes.

The Constitution makes it clear that a vice president's role is largely ceremonial in the certification process

The committee also said it was probing whether Donald Trump's own White House lawyers concluded that he attempted to interfere with the election outcome.

They also think Ms Trump may have heard about these alleged efforts from Mr Pence's staff, members of Congress and the White House counsel's office.

Serial rebel, Brexiteer and Tory backbencher Steve Baker helped establish the group of around 20 MPs who are concerned about the costs of reaching net zero.

And his warning comes amid an escalating cost of living crisis.

Image: Many fear the costs of reaching net zero which will include the move to electric cars

Mr Baker told Sky News: ""I genuinely believe that when the full costs of net zero start hitting us, if people have never been given a choice at the ballot box, we could end up with something bigger than the poll tax, certainly bigger than Brexit, because the numbers of people hit by it and their inability to cope will be huge.

""I am sick to death of people talking to me about food and fuel poverty, and then piling costs on the poor.

""This is a fundamental moral issue.

'MPs know this is going to hit all voters and hit them hard'

""I've started three big projects of MPs on the issue of the day - one on Brexit, one on COVID, which of course affected everybody, and one on net zero.

""Of the three of them, the one that grew fastest by miles was net zero, simply because members of parliament know this is going to hit all voters and hit them hard and hit them fast and they aren't going to like it.""

Mr Baker's warning comes as the prime minister is fighting another significant division - battling to regain support from within his party as it responds to the ongoing ""partygate"" scandal.

The Net Zero Scrutiny Group, which includes former cabinet minister Esther McVey MP, recently signed an open letter demanding the government scrap green levies on energy bills and increase the amount of gas extracted from the North Sea.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:42 Will the govt's net zero strategy work?

But the larger, greener wing of the Conservative party sees things very differently.

Warnings of social unrest over net zero 'populist' and irresponsible

Its members point out that some of those belonging to the Net Zero Scrutiny Group are affiliated with the Global Warming Policy Foundation which has been described by scientists as a climate-sceptical organisation responsible for pushing misinformation, something it has denied.

Mr Baker is a trustee of the foundation.

Conservative Environment Network member Chris Skidmore MP said warnings of social unrest over net zero were irresponsible and populist.

In line with Boris Johnson, he and his colleagues see the prospect of a ""green industrial revolution"" and the massive investment it will require as fundamental to driving opportunity and stability in the decades to come.

They also view the net zero strategy as the answer to the energy price crisis that is helping to drive up the cost of living, arguing that the switch to renewables and nuclear will eventually provide a greater degree of energy sovereignty and reduce exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices.

Mr Skidmore told Sky News: ""My greatest fear is that we end up with this race to the bottom, of… parties wanting to politicise energy prices, politicise net zero, and the only sort of winners in that are going to be the populists.

Image: The government has promised a range of support which includes helping some replace gas boilers with heat pumps

""We do need to look at making sure that we do tackle the issues around cost of living, that we do make sure that we argue the case that actually net zero is not just about going green, it is about supporting jobs for the future, actually creating an entirely new economy.

""It will be painful and difficult, but we don't, as a result, want to have a reaction that throws it entirely out of the window.""

The target of reaching net zero by 2050 was enshrined in law in 2019 by then prime minister Theresa May, and was included in that year's Conservative Party manifesto.

The government has promised a range of support, particularly for those on lower incomes, for things like insulation and replacing gas boilers with heat pumps.

It has not ruled out tax rises or reduced public spending to help meet the huge cost of decarbonising homes, transport, manufacturing and more, but it simply cannot pay for everything.

What will be the price we have to pay?

The government's Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the total investment of public and private money needed to make net zero happen will be £1.4trn up to 2050, but this sum will be offset by more than £1trn in savings as a result.

The Climate Change Committee, which is the independent body that advises the government, says that spending needs to ramp up quickly to £50bn a year by 2030, five times what is being spent now.

We visited Lewes in Sussex - a relatively wealthy constituency that voted Conservative in the last two elections and where the Green Party has also been growing in popularity.

As in the rest of the country, there is broad support for tackling climate change and for the net zero target, but growing concern among residents about how much they might have to pay for it personally amid a cost of living crisis.

Farmer Will Kirkham said he was worried about the total cost of getting to net zero but also the potential for new taxes or more expensive products and bills in the short-term.

""Farmers don't make much money as it is, let alone with an extra forking out of however much it's going to be to change it all,"" he said.

Pensioner Peter Gibson said climate change needs to be tackled but simply could not afford any extra upfront costs, even to deliver savings in the future.

""Some of these homes, flats and houses need doing and you just haven't got the money to do it with because everything goes up, even food,"" he said.

But head brewer at Harvey's Miles Jenner said he believed there was little choice.

He said: ""I think it's the price that we all have to pay if we are going to make inroads and take the problem with the seriousness that it deserves.""

When it came to age, those in the 30 to 49-year-old age bracket paid 48% more - a £24 difference - and the over-50s paid 46% more - a £23.19 difference - on average for a 12-month Tinder Plus subscription.

Which? said it had reported its findings to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and the Information Commissioner's Office.

The group's director of policy and advocacy, Rocio Concha, said the research suggested ""unlawful price discrimination"", whether or not it is intentional on Tinder's part, and potentially unlawful processing of personal data.

""If regulators decide that Tinder's personalised pricing is breaking the law, then the dating app giant must face strong action.""

Tinder said it was ""categorically untrue that our pricing structure discriminates in any way by sexual preference"".

It told Which? that older people did have to pay more in some countries, but said the price difference was ""a discount for younger users"".

The Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful to charge people of one sexual orientation more than others unless there is a clear justification for this.

The consumer group noted that it was occasionally justifiable under UK law to offer age-based price variations for the same product or service, such as discounts to over-65s or students, where it can be shown there is a legitimate basis for this.

However, it said that in the case of Tinder it was unclear as to why over-30s were paying more.

What has Tinder said about the claims?

A Tinder spokeswoman told Which?: ""Tinder is free to use and the vast majority of our members enjoy our app without upgrading to the paid experience.

""However, we do offer a variety of subscription options to help our members stand out and match with new people more efficiently.

""Tinder operates a global business and, in some geographies, we offer discounted subscriptions to younger members.

""In addition, we frequently offer promotional rates which can vary based on factors like location or length of subscription. No other demographic information is considered in our pricing structure.""

An EHRC spokeswoman said: ""As Britain's equality regulator it is our job to protect, uphold and enforce equality laws. We take reports of discrimination very seriously.

""This report of potential discrimination by Tinder is concerning. We will consider these findings by Which? and respond in due course.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121041004/http://news.sky.com/story/tinder-charges-more-for-young-gays-lesbians-and-over-30s-claims-which-12521152;

The people of Croydon hate this label - and they're doing everything they can to get rid of it.

But there's a reason for this unwanted reputation.

Grim rollcall of young victims killed in capital this year

Image: Youth worker Anthony King organised the event to send a message to young people

Last year was the worst on record for teenage murders in London. There were 30 in total, and five happened in Croydon - more than any other borough in the capital.

But the community is fighting back. The killings have sparked the birth of a new movement.

A group of more than 100 community members - including youth workers, schools, the Met and local politicians - have united to tackle knife crime in the area.

Image: Jermaine Cools, 14, was stabbed to death in November 2021

""Croydon, this has to stop!"" Anthony King's booming voice echoes around the streets of his home town.

The youth worker has organised a march to send a message to the young people. Hundreds join him to march through the main strip of shops.

Anthony tells me: ""We're here to send the youth a message - that we're here for you. We need mothers to stop the narrative that there's no men in our communities.

""There are men in our communities and there are men that want to stop the knife crime. The parents in this community should stop and search their children before the Met do.

""I'm working with the Met, look at my skin colour. I will stand with the Met until we've got this problem dealt with.""

Image: Jermaine's father Julius Cools says 'it has to stop now'

The march passed the spot in London Road where 14-year-old Jermaine Cools was stabbed to death in November 2021.

His father, Julius Cools, strokes his picture at the scene as the procession passes.

Julius tells me: ""Jermaine was our life - he meant everything to us. My son lost his life, and the boy who killed him has lost his too, because he's in prison now.

""There's no end to this. It has to stop now.""

Image: Tilisha Goupall says she is 'scared to have kids'

I also meet Tilisha Goupall, whose 15-year-old brother Jermaine was stabbed to death in Croydon in 2017.

""These young kids don't understand the impact of carrying a knife. I can't put into words how this has affected my family. I don't want anyone to go through what we've been through.""

She added: ""I'm scared to have kids. If I have a child, is my child going to get stabbed? Am I going to have to go through that trauma again? Because of what's happening now - with all the teenagers dying.

""Am I going to have to raise a child only to know that one day they'll be killed? That's a trauma I don't want.""

Image: Jermaine Goupall, 15, was stabbed to death in Croydon in 2017

After her brother's death, Tilisha launched the Justice for Jermaine Foundation to educate young people about the impact of carrying knives.

The march was part of a concerted effort to take the youths off the streets and out of the clutches of gangs.

One of the many organisations involved is United to Change and Inspire (UTCAI). Its co-founder Troy Davis said: ""The reason for the violence comes down to many things - you just have to look at the economics.

Image: Troy Davis is the co-founder of United to Change and Inspire (UTCAI)

""The first thing that is going to be cut is the thing that affects young people, so when you take away hope - what do you think is going to happen? Of course, it's going to spiral out of control.

""And that's what we're here to do - to provide opportunities for the young people here and making sure that they progress in society.""

The combined efforts to combat knife crime in Croydon include ex-gang members. I was invited to meet Jay Jay, who has mentored more than 1,000 youths in the area.

He was working with a teenager who has recently turned his back on gangs.

He told me: ""I got involved in selling drugs, carrying knives, getting involved in gangs. But me going through all that gave me a first-hand insight into how our youth think.

""It makes it much easier to get through to these kids. They're much more likely to engage with me because they know I've lived it - I've been to prison and turned my life around.""

1410;1410;Pension scandal: Long-term underpayment of thousands is a 'shameful shambles', says group of MPs;Friday 21 January 2022 04:02, UK;[];['pensions'];['errors', 'scandal', 'pac', 'mps', 'department', 'pensioners', 'group', 'underpaid', 'underpayment', 'longterm', 'thousands', 'underpayments', 'pension', 'dwp', 'state', 'shambles', 'shameful'];"The long-term underpayment of state pensioners, an unknown number of whom will have died without receiving what they were owed, is a ""shameful shambles"", according to a public spending watchdog.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) estimates it has underpaid 134,000 pensioners, mostly women, over £1bn of their state pension entitlement, with some errors dating as far back as 1985.

In January 2021, DWP started an exercise to correct the errors - the ninth such exercise since 2018, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said.

Dame Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the PAC, said: ""Departments that make errors through maladministration have a duty to put those it wronged back in the position they should have been, without the error.

Image: The handling of the crisis has been described as a 'shameful shambles'

""In reality DWP can never make up what people have actually lost, over decades, and in many cases it's not even trying.

""An unknown number of pensioners died without ever getting their due and there is no current plan to pay back their estates.

""DWP is now on its ninth go at fixing these mistakes since 2018, the specialised staff diverted to fix this mess costing tens of millions more to the taxpayer and predictable consequences in delays to new pension claims.

""And there is no assurance that the errors that led to these underpayments in the first place will not be repeated in the correction exercise.

""This is a shameful shambles.""

The errors mostly affect widows, divorcees and women who rely on their husband's pension contributions for some of their pension.

Complex pension rules and a reliance on highly manual systems led to the underpayments.

The committee of MPs said the underlying IT system relied on to manage millions of pensioner records dates back to 1988.

Quality checks failed to identify the systematic underpayments and small errors added up over years to significant sums of money.

The PAC said the department should consider whether there are cost-effective ways to upgrade its IT systems ""as a matter of urgency"".

How much will it cost to fix the errors?

There is currently no formal plan for contacting the next of kin where a pensioner who was underpaid is dead, the committee said.

The DWP is only paying those it has identified as having a legal entitlement to arrears, in some cases many years after the event, and has been inconsistent in paying interest, it added.

Women on pensions as low as £1 a week could be owed 'lottery winning' sums

It has also shown little interest in understanding the further knock-on consequences, including on social care provision, for those it underpaid, MPs said.

Fixing DWP's mistakes comes at great cost to the taxpayer and is expected to cost £24.3 in staff costs alone by the end of 2023, the PAC added.

It also said the department should be treating state pension underpayments as seriously as overpayments.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121041004/http://news.sky.com/story/pension-scandal-long-term-underpayment-of-thousands-is-a-shameful-shambles-says-group-of-mps-12520971;

Boris Johnson confirmed on Wednesday that most measures under Plan B will end on 26 January, while work from home guidance has already been dropped.

Similar announcements have been made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after all four nations have seen a drop in case numbers.

Here are the latest rules in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

England

Restrictions on working from home were dropped by the government on Wednesday, with the prime minister saying England was reverting to Plan A ""because of the extraordinary booster campaign"".

Image: Boris Johnson announced the changes in the House of Commons earlier this week

Mandatory COVID-19 passes for entering nightclubs and large events will end from 27 January, as will the rules around face masks in places where you mix with people you don't usually mix.

Secondary school pupils no longer have to wear face coverings in classrooms and guidance on their use in communal areas will also be removed.

What are the coronavirus rules across the UK

Mr Johnson also said that announcements on travel restrictions and care home visits will come in the coming days.

The legal requirement for people who test positive for coronavirus to self-isolate is expected to end on 24 March but could be brought forward if the data allows.

Current isolation rules remain in place, meaning anyone who returns a positive test result in England will have to isolate for five days.

The length of isolation was cut down from seven days on 17 January and people will be able to end quarantine if they have negative lateral flow test results on days five and six.

Will the gamble pay off? Plan B rules to end in England - but is it too soon?

Scotland

While strict rules remain in place in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced this week that there would be some loosening of restrictions on 24 January.

The three-household limit on indoor gatherings will be scrapped, while the limit on the number of people allowed to attend indoor events will also be dropped.

Social distancing in indoor public spaces will no longer be required and hospitality venues won't have to restrict customers to table service.

Nightclubs will also reopen but face coverings will remain as a legal requirement on public transport and in shops, hospitality and leisure venues.

But from 24 January these two changes will come into force:

Organisers of large events of 1,000 or more people should check the certification status of at least 50% of attendees rather than the current 20%.

The requirement to be fully vaccinated for the purposes of corporate certification will include having a booster if the second dose was more than four months ago.

Wales

Wales will continue on its roadmap back to coronavirus alert level zero later this month, First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed on Thursday.

Mr Drakeford said that the country has ""passed the Omicron peak"" and can keep lifting restrictions as part of its ""careful and phased plan"".

From today, Wales moves to alert level zero for all outdoor activities.

This means there are now no limits on the number of people who can take part in outdoor activities, while crowds are allowed at outdoor sporting events once more.

Outdoor hospitality is also be able to operate without additional reasonable measures, such as the rule of six and two-metre social distancing.

COVID passes are still required for entry to larger outdoor events of more than 4,000 people if unseated and over 10,000 people if seated.

From 28 January, the plan is for Wales to complete the move to alert level zero.

This will mean working from home will no longer be a legal requirement, while the rule of six will be removed in hospitality, cinemas and theatres.

Social distancing requirements in workplaces and places open to the public will be scrapped.

Northern Ireland

From midday today, people will no longer be restricted to table service and sitting in groups of six at restaurants, pubs and bars in Northern Ireland.

The current three-household limit on gatherings inside private homes will also be scrapped, but no more than 30 people will be allowed to stay overnight.

Northern Ireland's Department of Health has also agreed to change its self-isolation period to five days - providing people have negative lateral flow test results on days five and six, from today.

The guidance on working from home will be relaxed to working remotely ""where you can"", while people will no longer be required to prove they are exempt from wearing a face mask in public spaces.

From 26 January, nightclubs will be able to reopen and vaccine passports will no longer be required to attend venues like pubs, restaurants and cinemas.

The new measures will be reviewed on 10 February and further changes could be introduced then.

Republic of Ireland

The Irish government has been given the green light to lift COVID restrictions by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).

Nphet has recommended restrictions around hospitality can be lifted, including the 8pm curfew and live venues and sports venues can return to full capacity.

COVID passes will only be required for international travel but face masks are still recommended in shops and public transport.

Government ministers will meet today to assess the advice before Taoiseach Micheal Martin is due to make an announcement.

It comes after the PM said yesterday that he has seen ""no evidence to support"" claims that Conservative MPs who want him to resign have been intimidated by party officials.

Fears are growing inside 10 Downing Street that former pub landlady Sue Gray could call time on Boris Johnson in her Whitehall report on partygate.

Sky News understands there is nervousness in Number 10 over what the top civil servant's report on the Downing Street parties - which some MPs believe could be published as early as Monday - will reveal.

According to sources, some in Downing Street fear the investigation has unearthed damaging evidence and they are now doubtful the report will clear the prime minister.

Although his allies dispute this, they admit they will not know until the report is published, at which point Mr Johnson has promised to make a Commons statement to MPs.

The PM's enemies claim that after a lull in their campaign to submit letters to 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady demanding a confidence vote, more rebel MPs are poised to strike after the report is published.

However, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss reiterated her support for Mr Johnson during a news conference in Sydney, Australia.

When questioned about the partygate, Ms Truss said: ""The prime minister has my 100% support. He is doing an excellent job. I want the prime minister to continue as long as possible and he is doing a fantastic job.""

Key email could condemn prime minister

Fears about the verdict of Ms Gray's inquiry have been prompted by reports that she has learned that the civil servant who organised the Downing Street party on 20 May 2020 was urged to cancel it.

The Daily Telegraph reports that Ms Gray has found an email that allegedly confirms allegations that concerns were raised over the event before it took place.

The Guardian describes it as a ""significant email"", The Times say it is a ""critical email"" and the reports claim a senior official warned Number 10 aide Martin Reynolds it broke lockdown rules.

PM employed delay tactic but Gray's report could leave PM in an untenable position

Since the 20 May 2020 event was first highlighted, the PM has urged his political opponents and his Tory critics to wait for Ms Gray's report.

The senior civil servant, 64, who famously took a career break to run a pub in ""bandit country"" in Northern Ireland, has interviewed dozens of Number 10 staffers as well as Mr Cummings and MPs believe publication is now only days away.

Which Conservative MPs have called on the prime minister to quit?

Publication of details of the warning email in Ms Gray's report would leave Mr Johnson in deep trouble over his claims that the 20 May gathering - which he says he attended for 25 minutes - was a ""work event"" and nobody told him it was against COVID-19 regulations.

The PM and his supporters, however, are likely to argue in his defence that while Mr Reynolds was urged to cancel the party the report may conclude that the concerns were not raised with Mr Johnson.

The heightened anticipation of Ms Gray's report comes after a furious row at Westminster over a claim by Tory MP William Wragg that rebel Conservative MPs faced intimidation and blackmail threats from government whips.

The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai underwater volcano erupted on 13 January and 15 January.

The eruption was so powerful that it could be heard from as far away as Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia.

It also caused a tsunami.

Image: Officials said that three people died in the disaster

Officials from the UN's humanitarian arm estimated that roughly 84,000 people - or more than 80% of Tonga's population - were affected by the eruption.

At least three people were killed - including one Briton, homes have been destroyed on several islands, and the country has been left with a polluted water supply.

The disaster also knocked out communications for the nation of about 105,000 people, cutting it off from the rest of the world.

Humanitarian aid and a message from the Queen

The first planes carrying foreign aid arrived in Tonga on 20 January, five days after the tsunami and once a blanket of ash could be cleared from the airport runway.

They were a Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules and an Australian Globemaster aircraft.

Between them, they carried water containers, desalination equipment, shelters, kitchens, a sweeper to remove ash, generators, hygiene kits, and communications equipment.

Great care was needed, as Tonga is one of the few countries to have avoided any community transmission of COVID-19 so far in the pandemic.

Aid from Japan is also on the way.

Some telephone connections have been restored, but it could take another month for full services to resume.

The Queen sent a message of condolence to His Majesty Tupou VI, the King of Tonga, on Thursday.

""I am shocked and saddened by the impact of the volcanic eruption and tsunami in Tonga,"" she said.

""My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Tonga, as you work together to recover from the damage caused.

The actress-turned-entrepreneur said the Hands Off My Vagina candle will honour the Roe v Wade case on 22 January.

In the famous 1973 ruling, the US Supreme Court held that a woman's right to an abortion fell within the right to privacy protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

It gave a woman the right to an abortion throughout her pregnancy, defining different levels of state interest for regulating the procedure during the second and third trimesters.

But the ruling has come under pressure in recent years, with Texas and Mississippi among the states trying to curtail those rights.

""And yet, there is a recurring need to say: Hands off. Hands off our vaginas in any context where they're not invited.

""Your reproductive organs; your choice.""

The candle costs $75 (£55) and $25 (£18) of each sale will be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation's Reproductive Freedom Project.

The candles will be sold on Paltrow's Goop website and donations will be made until 1 July.

More on Meat Loaf Meat Loaf 'suing hotel and horror convention' after stage fall

Meat Loaf was one of the most iconic voices in rock music, and tracks such as Dead Ringer For Love, Paradise By The Dashboard Lights and I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That) sold millions of copies during his career.

On screen, his turn as Eddie in the original Rocky Horror Picture Show in 1975 was one of his first film roles, later appearing in huge box office hits such as Spiceworld: The Movie, Wayne's World and The 51st State.

But it was of course Bat Out Of Hell that the most recognisable hit of his career.

It was written by his collaborator Jim Steinman (who died last year, aged 73), and went on to be released three times - though it only ever got to number 8 on the UK singles chart.

The album however, which also featured tracks Heaven Can Wait, Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad and All Revved Up With No Place To Go, remains the fourth biggest selling record of all time (behind Michael Jackson, AC/DC and Whitney Houston), despite never reaching number one in the US or UK.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121091403/https://news.sky.com/story/meat-loaf-us-singer-whose-hits-included-bat-out-of-hell-has-died-aged-74-12521451;

The 3.7% month-on-month decline in sales volumes reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) follows a strong November, when some consumers chose to make Christmas purchases early.

A fall in demand for petrol and diesel, due to more people working from home under Plan B rules, also contributed to the slump.

It was significantly worse than the 0.6% drop that had been pencilled in by forecasters and was the biggest December decline on records going back to 1996.

The fall was also the worst for any month since last January when Britain was coming under a tough new lockdown.

It highlighted the pressure on businesses created by the Omicron variant - and restrictions designed to tackle its spread - over the key festive season.

They will be now hoping for a boost as the Plan B rules are lifted - though separate figures published on Friday by GfK show a sharp drop in consumer confidence blamed on the surge in the cost of living.

The ONS data showed that in December, retail sales even failed to match last year's COVID-hit festive period, charting a 0.9% year-on-year decline.

Heather Bovill, ONS deputy director for surveys and economic indicators, said: ""After strong pre-Christmas trading in November, retail sales fell across the board in December, with feedback from retailers suggesting Omicron impacted on footfall.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:57 'Pandemic has played to M&S; strengths'

The figures showed that fashion stores saw an 8% decline and department stores dropped 6.3%, while food store volumes were off by 1%.

Online sales were slightly higher as a proportion of the total, at 26.6%, than they were in November, at 26.3%, according to the ONS.

For 2021 as a whole, retail sales were up by 5.1% - a level of growth that has not been higher since 2002.

However that follows a 1.8% decline in 2020 when the pandemic took hold. Compared with 2019, annual retail sales last year were up by a more modest 3.2%.

Bethany Beckett, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the retail sales data added to evidence of Omicron dragging on GDP in December.

She added: ""With encouraging signs that the Omicron outbreak may have turned a corner and the government's Plan B restrictions due to be lifted next week, retail sales may recoup a bit of this fall in January and probably all of it in February and March.

""That said, with the UK's cost of living crisis looming, we expect a weakening in the consumer recovery to dampen retail sales further ahead.""

Households are facing the highest rate of inflation for nearly 30 years as energy bills soar while other products such as food and clothing also become more expensive as firms pass on price pressures.

They are also due to be hit by a national insurance rise in the spring while expected Bank of England rate rises will add to the cost of monthly mortgage payments.

A GfK survey published on Friday showed consumer confidence this month falling to its lowest level since last February when the country was under lockdown.

GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said: ""The UK's financial pulse weakened further this January driven by concerns over personal finances and the general economic situation.

1426;1426;Omicron 'sub-lineage' BA.2 designated as COVID variant under investigation, says UKHSA;Friday 21 January 2022 15:47, UK;[];['covid-19', 'coronavirus', 'omicron'];['ba2', 'cases', 'sublineage', 'ukhsa', 'ba1', 'latest', 'omicron', 'designated', 'investigation', 'covid', 'evidence', 'uk', 'denmark', 'variant'];"The UK Health Security Agency has designated the Omicron variant sub-lineage, known as BA.2, as a variant under investigation - but current case rates are very low.

Just 53 sequences had been identified in the UK by 10 January, according to the UKHSA, which said it was doing further analysis.

Initial studies from Denmark - where it's quickly taken hold and now makes up around half of Omicron cases - show no difference in hospitalisations between 'original' Omicron and BA.2.

COVID news latest - live updates

Vaccines are also expected to be effective against BA.2 in fighting severe illness, according to Danish health officials.

However, more data is needed to test whether it could be even more transmissible.

The UKHSA's incident director, Dr Meera Chand, said the altered form of Omicron was not unexpected as it is ""the nature of viruses to evolve and mutate"".

""Our continued genomic surveillance allows us to detect them and assess whether they are significant,"" added Dr Chand.

BA.2 is S-gene positive - which may make it harder to show up as Omicron than BA.1, which accounts for 99% of cases.

S-gene target failure helps identify Omicron and can be picked up in PCR tests because as a rule Delta cases have the S-gene and Omicron cases don't.

Some 2,093 sequences of BA.2 had been recorded on an online database from 22 countries - including the UK, the UKHSA said last week.

Denmark's Statens Serum Institut, part of its ministry of health, has said hospitalisations appear to show no difference for the two Omicron lineages but that ""analyses regarding infectiousness and vaccine efficiency etc. are ongoing"".

""It is expected that vaccines also have an effect against severe illness upon BA.2 infection,"" it added.

Some experts have said it's possible the sub-lineage could spread quicker than 'original' Omicron.

Analysis: Something to keep an eye on - but no cause for panic Tom Clarke Science and technology editor @aTomClarke Could the timing be any worse? A new ""sub-lineage"" of Omicron coming along just as the government abandons all COVID restrictions. But while BA.2. is definitely something to be keeping an eye on, it’s not one to worry about too much based on what we know so far. BA.2 has been circulating in the UK for some time at a low level compared with the dominant type of Omicron here (BA.1). In parts of India and the Philippines it is the major version of Omicron. In previous waves there have been big regional differences in what sub-lineage of a particular variant is more, or less dominant. The reason it's been elevated to a ""variant under investigation"" is because of what's happening in Denmark. Yesterday, Danish officials announced the BA.2 sub-lineage now accounted for nearly 50% of cases in Denmark (up from just 20% at Christmas). What's more, the BA.1. version of Omicron and the Delta variant are on their way down in the country. Denmark also finds itself in a spectacular surge in COVID-19 cases. It's good evidence, though not proof, that the BA.2. might be more infectious than BA.1. The question scientists in Denmark are trying to answer is whether case numbers are surging there because of the BA.2 lineage or would have done whichever flavour of Omicron it might be. The feeling among virologists is that BA.2 can't be that much more infectious than BA.1 because if it was, we'd likely have seen it rapidly replace BA.1. in places like the UK. Yet we've seen a very small number of cases. For that reason it's unlikely to lead to a significant new wave of cases here – the difference between Omicron BA.1. and BA.2. is nothing like the difference between Delta and Omicron. Another reason we shouldn't be too concerned is that evidence from Denmark and India shows no evidence of increased severity of illness with BA.2 compared to BA.1. And while BA.1 is genetically different from BA.2, it is not anticipated it will be much better at avoiding antibodies from vaccines or previous infections. The worst that might happen is BA.2 gradually replaces BA.1 in the UK and makes the downward slope of our Omicron wave that little bit longer. But if COVID-19 has taught us anything it's to assume nothing and wait for the evidence. So watch this space.

""Consistent growth across multiple countries is evidence BA.2 may be some degree more transmissible than BA.1,"" tweeted Tom Peacock, a virologist from Imperial College London.

""Unfortunately this is really where the evidence mostly ends - we do not currently have a strong handle on antigenicity, severity or much evidence for how much more transmissibility BA.2 might have over BA.1 - however we can make some guesses/early observations.""

Big drop in England's R value

As coronavirus cases fall in the UK, England's R number range has dropped significantly in the latest UKHSA estimates, moving from 1.1-1.5 to 0.8-1.1.

This suggests the pandemic is shrinking or staying roughly level.

A value between 0.8 and 1.1 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 8 and 11 others.

Daily COVID-19 cases in the UK averaged nearly 500,000 during the week after Christmas, new analysis suggests.

This is almost three times the official figures recorded by the Department of Health.

An average of 173,400 new cases per day were recorded from 26 December to 1 January, according to the government's COVID dashboard.

But the true number of cases was likely to be nearer 479,100 a day, according to estimates by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

In the week to November 27, before Omicron had started to spread in the UK, the ONS estimated an average of 99,100 new cases a day - just over twice the average of 41,900 a day recorded on the dashboard.

The ONS estimates are now nearly three times the equivalent total on the dashboard.

The sharp difference in totals reflects just how many cases are being missed in the dashboard figures, which count only those people who have reported themselves as having tested positive for the virus.

This means the numbers are affected by how many people are coming forward for tests, have chosen to report their test results, or who are taking a test because they know they have coronavirus symptoms.

He added: ""We didn't expect any major breakthroughs to happen today, but I believe we are now on a clearer path to understanding each other's positions.""

Analysis: Why Ukraine’s border tensions matter to us all Dominic Waghorn International Affairs Editor @DominicWaghorn A huge amount is at stake in these talks and the urgency increases with each failed round of negotiations. Vladimir Putin wants to wind the clock back to the mid-90s and has made explicit threats about military action if his demands are not met. If that means an invasion of Ukraine, numerous military figures predict violence in Europe on a scale not seen since the Second World War. His deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, last week warned of consequences for security across the entire continent of Europe if Putin's demands are not met. That means we could all feel the impact of diplomatic failure even though Ukraine is on the other side of Europe. There is little sign of progress in these talks. One Russian official this morning told Sky News the Americans are stubborn as hell. It does not sound like the deadlock has been broken. But they may have found enough to continue talking, perhaps at a presidential level next.

On Russia's repeated insistence that it has no plans to invade Ukraine, Mr Blinken said: ""We're looking at what is visible to all, and it is deeds and actions and not words that make all the difference.""

But he said talks would continue and that the US was open to a meeting between the Russian leader Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden, if it would be ""useful and productive"".

Mr Lavrov described the talks in Geneva as ""constructive and useful"" and said the US had agreed to provide written responses to Russian demands on Ukraine and NATO next week.

But he said: ""I can't say whether we are on the right path or not.

""We will see when we get the American responses.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:26 Russia and the West: What's going on?

Mr Lavrov also said he hoped ""emotions would cool down"" over Ukraine and repeated the claim that Russia posed no threat to its former Soviet neighbour.

Moscow has demanded that NATO promise Ukraine will never be allowed to join the military alliance.

It also wants the allies to remove troops and military equipment from parts of eastern Europe.

However, the US and its allies have rejected these demands and repeatedly promised ""severe"" consequences including tough economic sanctions - though not military action - against Russia if an invasion goes ahead.

It came as the US treasury department slapped new sanctions on four Ukrainian officials, accused of being at the centre of a Kremlin effort to damage Ukraine's ability to ""independently function"".

Russia seized control of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014 and backed a separatist insurgency in the eastern part of the country, that has claimed more than 14,000 lives.

Mr Putin has faced limited international consequences for those moves, but the West says a new invasion would be different.

Mr Blinken has also sought to stress US unity with its partners after US President Joe Biden drew widespread criticism for saying retaliation for Russian aggression in Ukraine would depend on the circumstances and that a ""minor incursion"" would see a lesser response.

Mr Shapps said: ""…I'm calling for a bonfire of the banalities to bring down the number of announcements passengers are forced to sit through and make their journey that little bit more peaceful.""

However, a rail industry source told the PA news agency the Government does not control what announcements are made, and it would be ""crazy for it to intervene at that level"".

Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: ""We know people want the most relevant and timely messages on their journeys and to help with this, train operators are continuing their work to improve customer information, including cutting unnecessary onboard announcements.""

1432;1432;Russia-Ukraine tensions: Top diplomats from US and Russia set for crunch talks in Geneva - but what do both countries want?;Friday 21 January 2022 09:57, UK;[];['russia', 'ukraine', 'united states'];['russias', 'russia', 'tensions', 'crunch', 'countries', 'biden', 'russian', 'talks', 'ukraine', 'wants', 'military', 'russiaukraine', 'invasion', 'set', 'geneva', 'sanctions', 'diplomats'];"Tensions continue to boil in eastern Europe, as the threat of a Russian invasion in Ukraine continues to draw international attention.

On Thursday, US President Joe Biden warned that ""Russia will pay a heavy price"" if it invades Ukraine, while Russia announced naval drills in several parts of the world and claimed the West is plotting ""provocations"" in Ukraine.

In an attempt to ease tensions, the top diplomats from Washington and the Kremlin are set for crunch talks in Geneva.

What does America want from the talks?

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is preparing to meet his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, however the former indicated that talks will likely fail.

Ahead of the meeting, Mr Blinken said on Thursday: ""These are difficult issues we are facing and resolving them won't happen quickly.""

America wants one thing above all.

To get this settled without a Russian invasion of Ukraine so Washington can move attention eastwards. Joe Biden sees China as a much bigger threat and challenge than Russia and wants to focus attention in that direction.

Barack Obama felt the same, wanting a pivot to the east, but events have a way of interfering in international affairs and the middle east and Syria especially kept sucking his attention back in.

Mr Biden wants to avoid the same with Ukraine and Russia.

But President Biden knows the two are linked, that missteps over Ukraine will complicate matters over China.

Chinese President Xi Jinping is watching intently.

If Russia can ride roughshod over the West in Ukraine, the Chinese may be emboldened over Taiwan, which Xi Jinping wants absorbed into the Chinese mainland.

So the Biden administration has worked hard to deter Russia, assiduously trying to build unity and resolve among its allies on sanctions it hopes will be enough to avert invasion.

A carrot and stick approach

The sanctions are largely financial and economic but critics say that is like bringing a knife to a gunfight.

Washington hopes the carrot and stick approach will be effective.

The stick being the threat of sanctions, the carrot talks on issues Russia wants aired.

America is prepared to talk about transparency, better communication between NATO and Russia, arms reductions, military exercises and missile deployment, hoping that will assuage Russian fears about NATO's inexorable expansion to the east.

Image: The US has warned the Kremlin it will face 'heavy' sanctions if it invades Ukraine

On the face of it that is not nearly enough to meet Russia's demands for sweeping security guarantees.

But US negotiators hope there is enough to chew on while more and more military materiel is sent to Ukraine and while the window for invasion passes.

Come mid-February some military experts say the ground will be too soft for the movement of Russian heavy armour.

The Russians want to see written responses to their demands.

What does Russia want from the talks?

Today's high-level meeting in Geneva is unlikely to yield any major breakthroughs but at least the sides are still talking.

Russia's core demand, that NATO's open door policy be shut once and for all and that any promise of future membership for Ukraine and Georgia be revoked is the one issue where NATO has made clear it won't budge.

The more Russia threatens, the more likely it is that Russia's other core grievance, the provision of Western military support to Ukraine, will intensify further. That is a considerable diplomatic impasse.

Whatever might be said on other issues of strategic security, the US missile defence systems in Poland and Romania for example which are long-standing grievances for Russia, are secondary and were under discussion before Russia started its troop build-up. Concessions there are unlikely to cut through.

Image: President Joe Biden

NATO's promise of possible future accession to Ukraine and Georgia is in any case entirely academic. It will not happen anytime soon and both sides know that. Perhaps, if appeasement of sorts is a strategy the US will countenance, it is best to say that out loud.

The Russian stance that this is a complete package, take it or leave it, is a maximalist position and in any case Russia's foreign ministry has said it wants written responses to each proposal, (which Mr Blinken has already said he will not be giving), which would suggest they will consider the issues separately.

The question is: What is Vladimir Putin's ultimate goal? Even his own diplomats may not know. Will he be content with concessions around the edges of his security guarantee proposals or is diplomacy a side-bar in an inevitable slide to conflict? Is his prize to squeeze concessions from NATO, to downgrade Ukraine's defensive capabilities (which he could do with missile attacks without even sending troops across the border) or is it about Russia's place in the world - reasserting a Russian sphere of influence and ensuring Ukraine remains a buffer between Russia and the West? Or is it a more emotional pitch where Ukraine itself is the prize, wrenched as he sees it from the Motherland after the collapse of the Soviet Union?

Mr Putin may not be on some grand imperialist campaign but he does feel the loss of great power status keenly and he does believe in spheres of influence. Even now, with Europe on high alert, he has the whole world talking about him.

The US President's incursion vs invasion slip is perhaps of relatively little consequence. Russia knows Europe is not united on its response, especially when it comes to hybrid warfare tactics which don't involve actual military invasion. Russia has also never been swayed by the punishment, it has workshopped all possible sanctions scenarios and they have not deterred it before; it is swayed by the prize. The prize that only Mr Putin knows. That's what makes diplomacy so hard.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121153351/https://news.sky.com/story/russia-ukraine-tensions-top-diplomats-from-us-and-russia-set-for-crunch-talks-in-geneva-but-what-do-both-countries-want-12521366;

Kwasi Kwarteng extolled the benefits of office-based staff interacting directly as he called for a return to ""some degree of normality"".

The comments came after the government this week dropped working from home guidance that was reintroduced late last year to try to combat the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.

It resulted in city centres that were still recovering from earlier lockdowns again seeing reduced footfall during what is normally a key period for shopping and parties.

The measures were described by some as a ""lockdown by stealth"".

Mr Kwarteng's comments come after banks such as HSBC and Citigroup this week were among those leading the way in calling staff back to their desks in London.

Meanwhile, the UK boss of PwC said the accountancy firm was expecting a faster bounce back than the last time workers were encouraged to return following lockdowns.

The business secretary told LBC radio: ""We should get back to work.

""We've got to get back to some degree of normality.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:17 'We can go back to the normal UK of the last couple of thousand years'

""People working in the office do get benefits from working with colleagues, being able to interact directly with them and I want to get back to a sense that the pandemic is turning from a pandemic into an endemic.

""I think the sooner we get back to the pre-COVID world the better in terms of workplace practices.""

Mr Kwarteng also said he was trying to increase the number of people coming into work in Whitehall, with around 50% of his department back behind their desks.

Earlier, he told Sky News: ""I've said that people should start getting back to normal as soon as they can.""

However, ministers face some resistance from unions representing civil servants.

The public and commercial services (PCS) union has demanded consultation on any plans for a return to the workplace and maintains that ""given the ongoing threat from COVID... it is safer for staff to work from home where they can"".

HSBC has said staff would be welcome back in its offices as part of a hybrid approach while Standard Chartered has told staff its London headquarters will be open from Monday.

Citi's employees are ""expected to be in the office at least three days per week"", according to an internal memo seen by news agency Reuters.

Image: Mr Kwarteng called for a return to 'some degree of normality'

Kevin Ellis, chairman and senior partner at PwC UK, said: ""The number one question I'm being asked from our people is when can we get back to the office - they value time with colleagues, alongside the flexibility to work from home when helpful.

""After the last lockdown restrictions were lifted, it took us two months to get back to 80% capacity.

""We're expecting a faster bounce back now - people know the drill - and this is great news for small businesses and city centres that rely on office workers.""

Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the City of London Corporation, said that after Omicron ""cast a dark shadow over the Square Mile's recovery"", signs were now ""much more promising"".

Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin this week told Sky News that the lifting of COVID restrictions left him ""breakdancing round the living room"".

But he cautioned that warnings about COVID had ""put the frighteners on people"" and that ""having wound the public up… to too great an extent, it may be difficult to get back"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121153351/https://news.sky.com/story/we-should-get-back-to-work-declares-business-secretary-kwasi-kwarteng-12521630;

The drug cartel chief married Emma Coronel Aispuro on her 18th birthday in July 2007 but he remains legally tied to his first wife Alejandrina Salazar, a social worker he married in 1977, it is alleged.

The claims are in a new book by Anabel Hernandez called Emma And The Other Narco Women which is due to be published next week.

According to a report in the New York Post, Ms Coronel Aispuro, who is now 32, says in the book that she and the drug kingpin were married under ""the law of the divine"".

The book claims that El Chapo, whose real name is Joaquin Guzman Loera, bribed a priest in Sinaloa to conduct the religious ceremony for him and Ms Coronel Aispuro.

'Not just his lover but his formal partner'

The wedding celebration was reportedly attended by members of Mexico's army, politicians, and the governor of Sinaloa.

But Hernandez, a Mexican investigative journalist, says in the book that she verified as recently as last year that the marriage between El Chapo, 64, and his first wife Ms Salazar was still in place.

Hernandez spoke to Sky News about her research in July last year and, when asked if El Chapo and Ms Coronel Aispuro were legally married, she replied: ""That's a very good question.

""Legally they are not married - legally the only wife of El Chapo is Alejandrina Salazar, his first wife. He never gave her a divorce.

""(The marriage with Ms Coronel Aispuro) was kind of a ceremony inside the Sinaloa cartel... Emma was not anymore just his lover, she was his formal partner.""

El Chapo and Ms Coronel Aispuro have 10-year-old twin daughters together.

El Chapo and Ms Salazar have five children together but he has also had nine children with other women, according to the book.

In parts of India and the Philippines it is the major version of Omicron. In previous waves there have been big regional differences in what sub-lineage of a particular variant is more, or less dominant.

The reason it's been elevated to a ""variant under investigation"" is because of what's happening in Denmark.

COVID latest: Follow live updates from the UK and around the world

Yesterday, Danish officials announced the BA.2 sub-lineage now accounted for nearly 50% of cases in Denmark (up from just 20% at Christmas).

What's more the BA.1. version of Omicron, and the Delta variant are on their way down in the country. Denmark also finds itself in a spectacular surge in COVID-19 cases.

It's good evidence, though not proof, that the BA.2 might be more infectious than BA.1.

The question scientists in Denmark are trying to answer is whether case numbers are surging there because of the BA.2 lineage or would have done whichever flavour of Omicron it might be.

Omicron 'sub-lineage' BA.2 designated as COVID variant under investigation, says UKHSA

The feeling among virologists is that BA.2 can't be that much more infectious than BA.1 because if it was, we'd likely have seen it rapidly replace BA.1 in places like the UK. Yet we've seen a very small number of cases.

For that reason it's unlikely to lead to a significant new wave of cases here - the difference between Omicron BA.1. and BA.2 is nothing like the difference between Delta and Omicron.

Another reason we shouldn't be too concerned is that evidence from Denmark and India shows no evidence of increased severity of illness with BA.2 compared to BA.1. And while BA.1 is genetically different from BA.2, it is not anticipated it will be much better at avoiding antibodies from vaccines or previous infections.

The worst that might happen is BA.2 gradually replaces BA.1 in the UK and makes downward slope of our Omicron wave that little bit longer. But if COVID-19 has taught us anything it's to assume nothing and wait for the evidence. So watch this space.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121164123/https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-the-omicron-sub-lineage-appears-to-be-mild-but-the-pandemic-has-taught-us-to-assume-nothing-12521918;

But how did a man named after a minced-meat dish become one of the most recognisable and significant musical and cultural figures in the world?

Sky News analysis of the data behind his career shows why his status as an icon will live on when the night is over, when the morning comes and for years to come.

He sold more than 100 million records during his 54-year career, and his first Bat Out Of Hell album, released in 1977, spent more than 10 years in the Official Albums Charts.

That places him ninth on the all-time list and fourth, behind only Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and Oasis, if you exclude greatest hits albums.

I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That), spent seven weeks at number one in the UK in 1993 and also topped charts in a further 27 countries.

The album version of the song lasts more than 12 minutes - longer than Taylor Swift's recent record-breaker All Too Well (Ten Minute Version). It has been played more than 21 million times on Spotify.

The 'short' version, at 5:29, has been played more than 120 million times.

But as with so many of the biggest cultural icons, he wasn't restricted to music.

He also has 108 acting credits to his name, including the Oscar-nominated Fight Club, The Rocky Horror Picture Show and the 1997 Spice Girls film, Spice World.

Fellow music-and-acting crossover star Will Smith has just 74 credits, while despite limiting their careers to film alone, Leonardo Di Caprio and Meryl Streep have 46 and 94 respectively, according to IMDb.

Robert De Niro has slightly more - with 125 - but beating two out of three of the biggest names in Hollywood history ain't bad.

And his fame didn't end with the age of social media. There are 26 million Google results for a meme in which people suggested what he wouldn't do for love.

He clearly embraced this newfound notoriety among younger fans.

My friend interviewed Meat Loaf about ten years ago and he graciously signed a printed-out meme for me. A king. pic.twitter.com/ZmvRSxuViU — Caitlin Welsh (@Caitlin_Welsh) January 21, 2022

At Meat Loaf's peak it could be said that wherever you were and wherever you went, there was always gonna be someone with his face emblazoned on a T-shirt.

There are now more than 500 active listings for Meat Loaf memorabilia on Amazon and eBay.

One of the products Meat lent his name to was Veg, as part of a vegan food campaign by Frankie & Benny's.

He didn't take on the restaurant's suggestion of a rebrand to Veg Loaf, but was a vegetarian for 11 years as part of a diet that saw him lose 5st (32kg), from his 19st (120kg) peak.

Like a bat out of hell, Meat Loaf the man may be gone, gone, gone - but his legacy is far from over.

Ben Howlett, MP for Bath from 2015-2017, revealed the incident following senior Tory William Wragg telling the Commons he has been told of claims MPs who want Boris Johnson ousted have been intimidated and even blackmailed by the whips.

Mr Howlett told Sky News: ""I was campaigning as a marginal constituency MP for a project, it was a link road and people remember that in my constituency I was trying to get government funding for it and of course during the Brexit rebellions.

""The whipping operation involved me being told by a whip that if I ended up rebelling and continuing to rebel then I would lose out funding for that particular scheme, which was frankly outrageous at the time.""

He claimed the road would have reduced pollution and congestion in central Bath, where some areas have nitrogen dioxide levels above safe limits.

Underhand tactics from whips 'been going on for years'

Mr Howlett said he was a new MP at the time but had the support of some senior Tories which meant he received some helpful advice on how to deal with threats from whips.

He added: ""The advice I received at the time is 'nonsense, whips can't do that' and I was very good friends with the transport minister at the time so I could easily speak to the transport minister and say 'look this is what has happened' and of course, they allayed any fears.""

The former MP said those types of tactics ""have been going on for years"" so he is ""surprised"" the government is dismissing claims from current MPs about blackmail and intimidation.

What do whips do? Each party appoints MPs, who must be party loyalists, to help organise and guide parliamentary business - these are the whips. The term ""whip"" comes from hunting etymology where a ""whipper-in"" whips the hounds to keep them from straying from the pack. One of their responsibilities is to make sure the maximum number of their MPs vote, and vote the way their party wants to get government business through parliament. They are charged with promoting the leadership's agenda, not the backbenchers', and are a go-between for the two. How whips encourage MPs to vote the way the government wants is often secretive, but can involve them offering time off, promises of promotion, trips abroad and even a better - or worse - office. The whip can be removed from all of a party's MPs so they have a free vote. A three-line whip, where a vote on a weekly email is underlined three times, means an MP has to attend and vote the way the government wants. MPs can have the whip withdrawn, which means they are expelled from the party so remain an MP but are independent as they are no longer expected to follow the whip.

MPs considering releasing damning recording of chief whip

A group of 2019 intake Conservative MPs are reportedly thinking about releasing text messages and even a recording with the chief whip making threats.

One of the MPs told the Times: ""They pulled me over and I told them I was voting against them.

""They got right up in my face. They told me that if you think you're getting a single f***ing penny, forget it. If you think a minister is coming to your patch forget it. You're done.""

Mr Howlett said the evidence ""will end up coming out"" but added: ""An ex-whip told me earlier on today the first rule of whipping is don't leave any evidence so it seems like they have left a cookie crumb trail.""

Christian Wakeford, the MP who defected from the Conservatives to Labour this week, claimed whips threatened to pull funding for a school in his area if he did not vote with the government on free school meals during COVID.

Some Conservative MPs have expressed their surprise that whips would threaten MPs.

Fay Jones, an MP first elected in 2019, told Sky News the threat Mr Howlett claimed to have had ""isn't an experience I've been through"".

She told Sky News: ""The whips have been extremely fair to deal with, easy to deal with.

""Their job is to get government business through but some of the reports that have been made and the allegations, they really just don't ring true with me so I'm a bit confused to be honest.""

Isotonitazene, a synethic opioid that is used instead of or in addition to heroin, has been linked to 25 deaths and seven overdoses up to September 2021, the Home Office has said.

And the Home Secretary has asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) for advice on the appropriate classification of Isotonitazene under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

Priti Patel also wants advice on two other substances - CUMYL-PeGACLONE, a synthetic cannabinoid, and Diphenidine, which can have ketamine-like effects.

The three substances are currently covered by the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, which means that supply, but not possession, is unlawful.

She said: ""Reports of fatal overdoses linked to this dangerous substance have been deeply disturbing, and I want to act now to ensure no further lives are lost or families torn apart.

""I'm determined to end the misery and destruction caused by the misuse of drugs and will consider the ACMD's expert advice on tightening restrictions on this dangerous substance.""

The Home Office is required to consult the ACMD before changing any legislation.

In October last year, the National Crime Agency said it was targeting drug networks that mix Isotonitazene into batches of heroin brought to Britain from Afghanistan.

It came after Public Health England issued a patient safety alert in August, warning of an ""unprecedented"" number of overdoses potentially caused by heroin mixed with Isotonitazene.

In the US, more than 100,000 Americans died in a single year from drug overdoses, experts estimated.

""I thought 'should I ring the doctors or should I not?' because COVID was happening. I didn't want to bother the GP and then in the end it got so consistent that I thought I better call up just in case.""

Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the Kurdish northeast of the country are battling to regain control of the jail after a car bomb exploded outside the walls on Thursday, setting off a major riot inside.

US forces in the country are helping to track down IS hideouts nearby using attack helicopters and air surveillance.

Among those killed were 20 soldiers and five civilians. Foreign fighters reportedly died too.

Suicide car bomb was used

SDF commander Siamand Ali told Sky News: ""Dozens of IS fighters launched an attack on the prison.

""They used a suicide car bomb which exploded at the front entrance of the prison. There was heavy fighting between prison security forces and IS fighters trying to enter the prison and from the surrounding area.

""Counter terrorism forces and SDF managed to kill 25 IS fighters who launched the attack on the prison and more than 80 IS prisoners were arrested.""

Gunfire could still be heard almost 24 hours after the initial attack took place, he added.

Officially, local authorities have denied that any IS fighters have escaped, but the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has said its sources believe ""dozens"" have fled.

Sky sources in northeast Syria have reported dozens of families leaving the surrounding area, frightened they will be caught up in the fighting or used as human shields by IS fugitives.

There are also reports that a college campus near the prison has been seized by Islamic State.

The jail holds around three-and-a-half thousand IS prisoners and is one of many in the region housing former members of the group.

Prisons overcrowded and inadequate

Kurdish forces have pleaded to the international community for help in securing the facilities but little assistance has been forthcoming, leaving the prisons in a precarious position.

Many are overcrowded and inadequate for holding violent terrorists; sporadic riots break out but are usually quickly crushed.

Last year, a United Nations report estimated 10,000 Islamic State fighters were still free in Iraq and Syria and warned that the organisation is re-grouping.

Sleeping soldiers murdered in Iraq

Meanwhile, eleven Iraqi soldiers were killed in their sleep by Islamic State gunmen, security officials said.

The attack happened at 3am on Friday in al Azim district, eastern Iraq, officials told the AP news agency.

IS militants broke into the barracks and murdered the sleeping soldiers in what was one of the deadliest attacks on the Iraqi military in recent months.

Reinforcements were reportedly sent to the village but no further details were given and there was no comment from the Iraqi military.

Islamic State was largely defeated in Iraq in 2017 but the group's militants continue to attack security forces, and infrastructure such as power stations.

In October the Sunni extremist group raided a mostly Shia village in Diyala province, killing 11 civilians and injuring several others.

According to officials, the militants had been angry that their ransom demands for kidnapped villagers had not been met.

Here Sky News looks at what's happening on the Russian-Ukrainian border, why tensions are so high and what it means for the West.

What's the history between Russia and Ukraine?

Ukraine was part of the Russian empire for centuries before it became part of the USSR.

When the Soviet Union dissolved with the end of the Cold War in 1991, Ukraine became independent.

Although their shared history means the two are still very culturally linked, Ukraine has sought to distance itself from Russia in recent years and instead look to the West for support.

By contrast, Ukraine was a huge loss for Russia, as it had the biggest population of all the former Soviet states to break away from Moscow.

And with Vladimir Putin's rise to power, the Kremlin has sought to regain influence and control over its former territories.

This began with a more subtle approach in the early 2000s, but when his favoured candidate in the 2004 Ukrainian election Viktor Yanukovych was ousted for rigging the result amid ""Orange Revolution"" protests in Kyiv, things began to change.

Furious with the election of pro-Western opposition candidate Victor Yushchenko, Mr Putin's approach became more aggressive.

It culminated in Russia's illegal annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014.

Mr Yanukovych managed to gain power after five years of Mr Yushchenko in 2010 and served for four years.

But when the Kremlin-backed president rejected an association agreement with the EU in favour of bolstering relations with Moscow, there were huge protests and he was ousted.

Russia's response was to annexe Crimea and declare it independent from Ukraine.

It also sent troops into the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk - an area known as Donbas - to support separatists who had been trying to break away from the country.

Fighting in Donbas, which is near the Russian border, has resulted in the death of more than 14,000 people since 2014.

France and Germany spearheaded a peace agreement between the two sides in 2015, which helped end major conflicts, but it failed to unite the two sides politically and small-scale tensions have continued since then.

In early 2021 there had been increasing incidences of breaking the 2015 ceasefire, which fuelled fears of a war, but in April Moscow pulled back most of its troops and tensions lessened.

Where are troops stationed now?

Currently there are around 100,000 Russian troops stationed at various points along its 1,200-mile border with Ukraine.

Last week US intelligence officials claimed that Russia is planning to deploy as many as 175,000 troops in preparation for a potential invasion that could happen early this year.

Image: A map shows the numerous sites Russian troops are stationed at along the Ukrainian border

Most of Russia's military presence on the border is concentrated in the eastern breakaway provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk where its soldiers have been stationed in support of separatist rebels since 2014.

There has also been significant military presence to the north of Ukraine in areas such as Klintsy and Yelnya.

Satellite images from Yelnya, which also borders Belarus, in November 2021 showed Russia increasing its military presence, which has fuelled fears a war could break out, given its strategic location near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

Aerial imagery has also revealed Russian military activity in areas north east of the Ukrainian border.

In November battle groups were seen training in Pogonovo before forces were pictured stationed at Soloti in December.

Tens of thousands of troops are also still stationed inside the annexed territory of Crimea, with satellite images revealing significant Russian military deployments there in November last year.

Ukrainian officials have repeatedly expressed concerns about Russian presence on the border, while the Kremlin insists it is just military training.

What does Russia want?

After rising to power in 2000, Vladimir Putin has sought to maintain the Russian ""sphere of influence"" over its two neighbours and former Soviet states of Ukraine and Belarus.

Any attacks on either state are seen by the president as a direct attack on Russian sovereignty.

He is also fearful of Western involvement in either resulting in a new democracy being established on the doorstep of Russia, which has become increasingly autocratic during his rule.

As such Russia has issued a list of demands that would reduce Western influence in the region.

It includes a guarantee that Ukraine would never become a member of NATO, that the two end their security alliance, and that numbers of NATO troops in eastern Europe are reduced.

The US and other Western allies have described such demands as ""non-starters"" and completely unreasonable.

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has been taking part in crisis talks with Russian officials, including foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, this week in a bid de-escalate tensions.

So far the West has indicated it would be prepared to compromise on how it carries out military exercises within the region and the location of missiles.

What does Ukraine want?

Ukraine insists that Moscow cannot control whether it moves closer towards becoming a member of NATO or other Western alliances.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russia is trying to destabilise the country in a bid to oust him.

He says such a coup could come ahead of any potential military invasion.

Ukraine has also suffered a winter energy crisis after Russia imposed crippling sanctions on fuel imports.

How is the UK involved?

The UK has deployed 2,000 anti-tank missile launchers and 30 elite troops to help train the Ukrainian armed forces in the face of a potential fresh Russian invasion.

An RAF C-17 transport plane has been seen flying back and forth between the UK and Ukraine since Monday, according to flight-tracking software.

Image: A British military cargo C-17 plane unloads anti-tank weapons in Ukraine

The weapons and personnel are being deployed as part of Operation Orbital, the British training mission set up in Ukraine in 2015 following the annexation of Crimea.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has stressed that British military presence in Ukraine is only for ""early-stage training"" and ""self-defence"".

""They are not strategic weapons and pose no threat to Russia,"" he said this week.

""They are to use in self-defence and the UK personnel providing the early-stage training will return to the UK after completing it.""

Image: British troops provide support to Ukrainian forces in the Kherson region of Ukraine on Thursday

A spokesperson for the Russian-UK ambassador said however: ""It is crystal clear that UK shipment of lethal weapons to Ukraine will only fuel the crisis.""

How could it affect relations with the West?

A fully-fledged conflict between Russia and Ukraine would have extreme consequences for international relations.

It would deepen hostilities between Moscow and the US, the UK, NATO and other Western member states.

Speaking on a visit to Australia, Liz Truss said: ""An invasion will only lead to a terrible quagmire and loss of life, as we know from the Soviet-Afghan war and conflict in Chechnya.

""We need everyone to step up. Together with our allies, we will continue to stand with Ukraine and urge Russia to de-escalate and engage in meaningful discussions.

""What happens in eastern Europe matters for the world.""

In December NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg threatened Russia with economic sanctions and ""political restrictions"".

He described the risk of an imminent invasion as a ""defining moment for European security"" and expressed his continued support of ""deterrence, defence and combined dialogue"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121180958/https://news.sky.com/story/russia-ukraine-whats-happening-on-the-border-and-why-are-tensions-so-high-12521513;

1464;1464;Migrant crisis: French police play cat and mouse with would-be stowaways hoping to make it to Britain;Friday 21 January 2022 19:32, UK;['adam parsons', '@adamparsons'];['migrant crisis'];['cat', 'waiting', 'play', 'migrants', 'french', 'hoping', 'henri', 'pull', 'lorries', 'lorry', 'migrant', 'men', 'stowaways', 'mouse', 'wouldbe', 'try', 'crisis', 'britain', 'day', 'drivers'];"It is the early hours of the morning, but this corner of Calais is busy, just as it always is.

At first, you don't notice many of the people. Sure, you see the blue flashing lights, the police vans speeding around and the articulated lorries driving in and out. But in the shadows and the gloom, there are hundreds of people milling around, all waiting to try to hitch a lift to Britain.

You see them as flashes of action. A lorry slows as it goes round a roundabout and suddenly there is a man sprinting alongside it. He reaches out his hands but can't quite pull himself up. The lorry speeds up again; the man slows up and walks away.

And so it happens again and again. Young men crouch in the shadows and then run out to try to pull themselves up on to a vehicle. Mostly they fail, and skulk away. Sometimes they pull themselves on, but are spotted by drivers, who come to an angry halt.

But occasionally they succeed. We watched one person, with a blend of audacity, agility and athleticism, run alongside a lorry, jump up and then pull himself into the space between cab and trailer.

It is extremely dangerous. Just recently, a teenager was killed after falling beneath the wheels of a lorry, the latest in a line of fatalities. But for the people who throng around this area, the risk is worth the potential reward. All these people are trying to get to Britain.

Image: Migrants put their lives at risk by trying to hop on the back of lorries travelling to the UK

Crossing the Channel in a boat involves paying a people smuggler, which can cost thousands of pounds, as well as the significant chance that the boat will be overloaded, sink, break down or simply not turn up.

Attempting to stow away on a lorry, by contrast, is free, and the supply of suitable transport is more predictable. The lorry parks of Calais are full of vehicles crossing the Channel every day. The challenge is firstly to get on board, and then to evade detection.

Neither is easy, which is why people often spend months on end attempting to get to Britain this way. And that's why, on this cold, dark night, the police are playing a cat and mouse game with all these migrants.

When a police van arrives in one place, the men go somewhere else and wait for the van to move on. No sooner has it left than the men return. It is a pattern that you see again and again.

Even when they are caught on the back of lorries, the police's powers to detain would-be stowaways are limited. Very rarely do even the most aggrieved of lorry drivers want to press charges. By and large, the drivers just want to get on with their journey.

So lorry drivers, migrants and police officers find themselves in an elaborate night-time choreography. A battle of wits and experience.

Image: French police spot migrants moving around at night as they attempt to hop on the back of lorries

Those running after the lorries are powered by hope, ambition and desperation. But for many of the police, it is weary work. Rarely do they speak to journalists but on this occasion, we strike up conversations with a group of officers from a unit of the CRS, the French force that specialises in controlling crowds and dealing with public disorder.

""It is like this every day,"" says Henri (that's not his real name), who's been coming to Calais for many years. ""Every day, every day. I've seen everything. In fact, I've seen everything twice.""

We are standing by the roadside, next to a hole in a security fence. He gently grabs my shoulder and points at a silhouette of a man in the distance. ""Look there. There he is. He's waiting for us to go. And as soon as we do, then he'll be back here.

""There is no reason for any of these people to be here except to try to get on to a lorry. It's the only thing they want to do.""

Image: One French officer said he doesn't believe the attempted crossings will ever stop

I ask if it's changing at all and he nods. ""Yes, for four or five months, it's been getting worse.""

What complicates his job is that none of these people even want to be in his country. ""They want to go to Britain, to become legal and then I think lots of these people want to go to America,"" he tells me. ""I talk to them. I even say 'what's wrong with France?' They say they think they are not welcome here. They all want to go to Britain - to England - and America.""

Migrant crossings: 2021 marks record year with more 28,000 people entering UK via English Channel

We spend some time with Henri and his team. They visit a lorry park, and find that a fence has been pulled down, even though it is topped with ferocious razor wire. The unit hunts for any people who might have got in, but can't see anyone. Either they've fled, or they're concealed inside a vehicle.

Further down the road, another apparently sturdy fence has been ripped open. Henri reckons it would cost two or three thousand euros to repair ""and it will be open again within a few days"".

Image: Migrants try and make it to the UK without the help of people smugglers by accessing lorries

They fire tear gas to disperse a group of men who are gathering alongside a road, waiting to jump on a vehicle. Later that evening, another group throws branches on to a motorway to try to slow lorries enough to give them the chance to leap aboard. Three police vans rush to the scene; the cat reacting to the mice.

It's not always about athletic endeavour, of course. Plenty of lorries have suffered smashed locks or torn sides, the signs of an unwanted visitor in a trailer. Drivers check their vehicles thoroughly, knowing they face a fine of up to £2,000 for every person they may inadvertently bring into Britain.

And even if a person does manage to avoid detection by the driver, a stowaway might well be caught by security checks at the port. Frankly, you have to be very lucky to get away with it, but some people do.

That's what inspires the ones left behind; the ones queuing up at the roundabout to take a run at the next passing lorry. ""I don't think it will ever stop,"" says Henri, as he prepares to go off shift. He'll be back tomorrow night, ready to face the same people, in the same place, doing the same thing.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220121200804/https://news.sky.com/story/migrant-crisis-french-police-play-cat-and-mouse-with-would-be-stowaways-hoping-to-make-it-to-britain-12522006;

Report reveals more details of parties on eve of Prince Philip's funeral

The first minister's criticism comes as more alleged details of two of the Number 10 parties under investigation were revealed.

According to the Daily Telegraph, staff in Downing Street partied until the early hours of the morning as part of a seven-hour drinking session the night before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral last April.

Downing Street has already apologised to Buckingham Palace over the two parties, one for departing communications director James Slack and the second to mark the exit of one of the PM's official photographers.

Mr Johnson was not present on the evening in question, but has said he ""deeply and bitterly"" regretted what went on as the Queen prepared to say goodbye to her husband of more than 70 years.

The Telegraph said it had seen a photo of staff at one of the parties, some of them clutching drinks, in the Downing Street basement.

The newspaper also said it had seen messages indicating that those present were still drinking at 1am, having started around 6pm the previous evening.

According to the Telegraph's latest report, wine and spirits with mixers were served in disposable plastic cups, with alcohol reportedly spilled on an office printer at one stage.

Staff ordered takeaway pizzas and some of those present are said to have used a slide belonging to Wilfred, Mr Johnson's son.

Previous reports have said Wilfred's swing was damaged as the two events spilled into the Downing Street garden.

Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said these latest details were ""disgusting"".

It doesn't matter that I reported on the wintry months of the Ukrainian separatist uprising in 2014 into 2015. Because each time one comes back, the weather is as horrendous and painful as ever.

Looking out across miles of frozen fields at the border fence between the two countries, I could feel my breath freeze, my fingers and toes turn blue, and cheeks red, whiplashed by a freezing wind and drifting snow.

They say the Russian army prefers to fight when the ground is frozen, and their tanks and vehicles can move quickly - it seems to me the conditions are now perfect and at the same time I can think of nothing worse than battling these elements while also fighting, but I'm not a soldier of course.

This frozen border between Ukraine and Russia is over a thousand miles long. It is divided by trenches and, in places, thin metal fences and berm.

Here in the Kharkiv region, the border is more than 173 miles long; only 50 miles of it is separated by the fence, the rest open farmland.

Image: Trenches in Ukrainian territory

More tense than usual

A few miles away from us, across freezing fields and drifting snow, thousands of Russian soldiers, tanks and missile systems are waiting for orders.

We can't see them, of course, but the State Border Guard of Ukraine is all too aware that, in the distance, they're there.

They tell us they continue to monitor Russian movements towards them but haven't seen a dramatic increase in activity.

It is, however, more tense than usual as the fears of an invasion or even an incursion grow.

On the face of it, Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Trubachov seems fairly unfazed by it all as he guides me through their border positions.

He points towards a tower on a hill, set 50 metres back from the fence proper. He told me that they have cameras on the tower, allowing them to monitor movements 24 hours a day.

""If we see any threat of an armed attack on Ukrainian territory, our units will take up defensive positions in the trenches,"" he explained.

""We have special reserves prepared for this; also this territory is equipped with surveillance cameras so we will see early signs of an attack and can warn the armed forces, who will send defensive support.""

Few people come outside - especially not in winter

This part of the fence between the two countries runs alongside a village. Zvyazok is a sleepy, snow-covered hamlet that butts up against the border fence.



Few people come outside - especially not in the winter - but we could see the occasional bicycle, car, children's swings, and hear the ever-present sound of barking dogs alerted to strangers in town.



As we filmed in the village and walked towards the border fence, I was surprised to see a moving vehicle, and suddenly realised it was on the other side.

It was a Russian border patrol passing by.

The Ukrainians say they're doing the same job as them and they see them often. The difference now is that their proximity of just a few metres seems so much more poignant, given the rising tensions between the two sides.

Image: The weather is 'as horrendous and painful as ever', Stuart Ramsay says

People in Ukraine's second city are alarmed

Those deepened tensions extend to the regional capital, Kharkiv.

Ukraine's second largest city is home to over a million people and was, for a period, the country's capital, during the Soviet era.

People here were alarmed after President Volodymyr Zelensky warned in an interview that their city could be an early target if President Vladimir Putin decided to invade.

You wouldn't necessarily know it's a city on edge as they go about their lives, but that doesn't mean they're not scared.

Image: Victor Pichugin and Yulia Napolska have mixed views about the current tensions

Victor Pichugin and Yulia Napolska are young professionals who live and work in Kharkiv, their lives revolving around their home city. And although they say they're used to the cross-border tensions through eight years of war, it feels worse these days.

""It feels like we are on the edge of something really terrible, and scary, and so yes, I can say this, I'm scared,"" Victor told me after considering my question for a moment.

He also said he wasn't sure if he'd stay, but that he might attempt to leave. He doesn't want war, he told me Ukraine is a peaceful country.

Yulia has decided to train to be a battlefield medic. She told us she won't be able to sit by and do nothing if her city, her friends and family, end up needing help.

""You know Russians are living by war, by their imperial ambitions, but Ukrainians, I agree with Victor, we are a peaceful nation, but in case, if someone tries to take our freedom again, we will fight back.""

The truth is that nobody knows what a full-scale invasion would look like were it to happen.

1479;1479;Highway Code revised: Cyclists given priority in new rules as drivers ordered to keep 1.5-metres distance when overtaking;Saturday 22 January 2022 02:08, UK;[];['highway code', 'cycling'];['given', 'highway', 'changes', 'cycling', 'looking', 'priority', 'overtaking', 'roads', 'distance', 'road', 'revised', 'cyclists', 'left', 'drivers', 'rules', 'ordered'];"A revised Highway Code comes into force this week that gives cyclists clear priority over drivers - with motorists given specific instructions on how much room to allow when overtaking.

The new list of advice and rules for people on Britain's roads will be updated from 29 January, pending parliamentary approval, and will introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.

But while the changes have been welcomed by cycling campaigners, the government has been accused of being ""far too silent"" in communicating them.

Drivers will have more responsibility to watch out for people cycling, walking or riding a horse - while cyclists will have more responsibility to be aware of pedestrians.

The new rules mean cars must leave at least 1.5 metres room when passing bicycles - and revised guidance also says ""it can be safer"" for cyclists to ride two abreast.

Cyclists are also now instructed to ride in the centre of the lane in slower moving traffic, ""on quiet roads or streets, moving over to the left if a faster vehicle comes up behind them, but only if they can do so safely"" and ""at the approach to junctions or where the road narrows, where it would be unsafe for drivers to overtake them"".

Other key amendments include drivers turning into a road being required to give way to pedestrians waiting to cross.

They are also now told not to cut across cyclists or horse riders going straight ahead when turning into or out of a junction or changing direction or lane, to avoid ""left hook"" collisions - and allow cyclists priority at roundabouts.

Another recommendation is for car users to reduce the risk of opening a door into the path of a cyclist by using the hand on the opposite side to the door, as that will often lead to them looking over their shoulder.

This is known as the Dutch Reach technique.

Provisional Department for Transport (DfT) figures show 4,290 pedestrians and 4,700 cyclists were killed or seriously injured in crashes on Britain's roads in the year to the end of June 2021.

But with just days before they come into force, a survey indicates one in three drivers are unaware of the major changes aimed at protecting cyclists and pedestrians.

One in 25 drivers have 'no intention' of looking at details of rule changes

A third of motorists (33%) polled for the AA said they did not know the Highway Code was being revamped, including 4% who had ""no intention"" of looking at the details.

More than 13,700 drivers were questioned between 8 and 18 January for the survey.

AA head of roads policy Jack Cousens said: ""While the government formally announced these changes last summer, they have been far too silent in promoting them.""

Duncan Dollimore, Cycling UK's head of campaigns, told Sky News: ""The changes to the Highway Code will happen overnight, so it is frustrating official communications come only after their introduction.

""That helps no one - neither the walkers and cyclists the rules are meant to protect, nor the drivers who are somehow meant to telepathically know about them.

""These are fundamental changes about the way we use our roads, it's essential we have a long-term well-funded public awareness campaign to make that change happen.""

A DfT spokesman insisted the changes ""were announced to national press"".

However, the department's website and social media accounts of the government's Think! road safety campaign have not yet mentioned the changes.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220122030712/http://news.sky.com/story/highway-code-revised-cyclists-given-priority-in-new-rules-as-drivers-ordered-to-keep-1-5-metres-distance-when-overtaking-12521747;

Different to those who describe themselves vaccine hesitant, anti-vaxxers tend to employ aggressive methods to persuade others not to get injections designed to help prevent disease.

The list was compiled by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) and found most of the figures, who claim to be political or medical leaders, are based in America.

After social media companies were made aware of the prevalence of the material some was removed, but many videos and articles remain online today.

Critics believe some are exploiting loopholes which mean that if they post content under another name or appear on a page hosted by another user their anti-vax content is not removed.

Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the CCDH, told Sky News that social media giants ""bear none of the cost for the content"" they host, including dangerous material which can drive users to their platforms.

He called on the companies to do more to remove it quickly, amid fears that those left unvaccinated remained more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and, crucially, hospitalisation.

He said the most effective anti-vaxxers were ""great marketers"" and drew people in by generating content related to wellness or fertility, then gradually linked these issues to vaccination.

Mr Ahmed said the algorithms used by social media platforms then fed people more and more similar content, until they see it frequently while online - thus normalising the opinions.

""All the platforms care about is content that people will spend time on so they can serve them adverts at the same time… they are reluctant to take any credible action,"" he said.

Image: CCDH chief exec Imran Ahmed says social media platforms 'are reluctant to take any credible action'

Ed Stubbs, a teacher who developed a package of lessons designed to tackle vaccine hesitancy in schools, said that because young people spent so much time online they could easily find themselves watching a lot of anti-vax content.

He warned that fear over the COVID-19 vaccine programme had fed into fears about other vaccines administered to young people as a matter of course in schools and prompted growing general hesitancy to getting vaccinated for anything.

""Young people obviously look on social media, they see quite a lot of jokes on Instagram and Tik Tok, things like 'I got my vaccine and then this happened to me',"" he said.

""They are jokes and the students would even tell me and be laughing while they say them, but it still has an effect on them and instead of vaccines being something quite dull, boring, and necessary, it's something that is controversial, weird and slightly alarming.""

Mr Stubbs added that labelling people who are vaccine hesitant as anti-vaxxers can be dangerous, especially in schools, as it drives discussion underground and gives teachers less opportunity to open up conversations which could encourage uptake.

But he also warned that teachers must be prepared to be unequivocal about the benefits of getting vaccine and not sit on the fence, because they are in a position of trust.

Chris Philp, a minister in the department for digital, culture, media and sport, said the government would legislate for fines and other action to force social media companies to remove content deemed damaging but admitted that policing the internet was not an easy task.

""The internet is a large space and there is definitely more to do and we are determined to make sure that with social media firms, we take the action necessary,"" he said.

""There's always more to do. And in fact, in the coming months, we're going to be introducing a piece of legislation, the online safety bill, to go even further in imposing statutory legal duties on social media firms to make sure they act in this area.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220122030712/http://news.sky.com/story/two-thirds-of-anti-vax-propaganda-online-created-by-just-12-influencers-research-finds-12521910;

Roe v Wade was a landmark ruling made by the Supreme Court 49 years ago to the day and this march has taken place every year since, with the exception of 2021, when it was held virtually.

But this year's event has an expectant, even celebratory tone.

Those who have travelled to the capital from across America feel their fight has reached its apex and that the Supreme Court is on the verge of overturning the constitutional right to abortion.

The president of the March for Life, Jeanne Mancini, is the first to take the stage, pointing out where the first aid tents are in case the minus temperatures becomes too much, before asking the audience a question.

""Do you believe that the unborn person should have the right to life?"" she says, to cheers from the crowd of several thousand.

""Now say it louder so the guy in the White House hears you,"" she shouts and they oblige.

This is a minority but it's a significant and noisy one.

Abortion is one of America's great issues of divergence, split often along political or religious lines and loaded with enough power to decide elections and sow further discord in an already deeply fractured society.

Members of Ms Castro's leftist Libre Party fought among themselves after congressman Jorge Calix was elected as congress president instead of Luis Redondo.

Ms Castro had earlier agreed with coalition partner the Honduras Saviour Party (PSH) that Mr Redondo would be elected for the position. However, around 20 rebel Libre Party members voted against Mr Redondo.

""A review of the notebook revealed written statements by Laundrie claiming responsibility for Ms Petito's death,"" the FBI's Denver Field Office said in a statement released Friday.

The notebook was found in October, in the same area as Laundrie's remains in Florida's Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park.

In their statement, the FBI added that both families have reached an agreement on how the couple's belongings will be distributed.

What happened to Gabby Petito?

Laundrie, 23, was a person of interest in the killing of Ms Petito, who was reported missing on 11 September by her parents while the couple were on a road trip.

Ms Petito's body was found on 19 September at a campground near Grand Teton National Park in northwestern Wyoming.

A coroner determined she'd died about three weeks earlier of ""blunt-force injuries to the head and neck, with manual strangulation"".

The FBI found Laundrie's body a month later, along with the belongings and Ms Petito's family suspected Laundrie was impersonating her in text messages after her death.

The FBI did not release specific details of what was written in the notebook but said that they had also found texts between the couple, sent after Ms Petito's death.

""The timing and content of these messages are indicative of Mr Laundrie attempting to deceive law enforcement by giving the impression that Ms Petito was still alive,"" the statement said.

Adele, 33, was set to do two concerts each weekend from 21 January until 16 April in the US city.

The Easy On Me singer said her production team had tried ""absolutely everything"" to pull the show together in time but that it had been ""impossible"".

She promised that dates would be rescheduled and apologised to fans for the last-minute decision.

Adele released her fourth album 30 in early November and it was revealed to be the fastest-selling of the year in its first week of release.

Caesars Palace tweeted its support for the artist and her fans, saying: ""Adele is an incredible artist, supremely dedicated to her music and her fans.

""Creating a show of this magnitude is incredibly complex.

But given the last bilateral defence talks between the two countries took place in London, Mr Shoigu has agreed to meet in Moscow instead.

Meanwhile, senior Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, said he believed a Russian invasion of Ukraine was ""imminent"".

Mr Ellwood told the BBC: ""Putin is taking full advantage of a weakened West. We are looking risk-averse, somewhat timid.

""Putin's ultimatum demanding NATO push back, of course that was dismissed but that's given him the pretext to say that there is an aggressor and that he must act.

NATO dispute

The Kremlin has demanded that NATO promise Ukraine will never be allowed to join the military alliance.

It also wants the allies to remove troops and military equipment from parts of Eastern Europe.

However, the US and its allies have rejected these demands and repeatedly promised ""severe"" consequences including tough economic sanctions - though not military action - against Russia if an invasion goes ahead.

The temporary facility, which is in a stronghold of the rebel Houthi movement in northern Saada province, was struck on Friday.

It marked another deadly day in the war between Saudi led coalition forces and Houthi rebels which has been going on since 2015.

A spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Stephane Dujarric, said further deadly airstrikes had been reported elsewhere in Yemen with three children among those reportedly killed in the western city of Hodeidah.

""An airstrike on telecommunications facilities in Hodeidah has also significantly disrupted vital internet services across much of the country,"" Mr Dujarric said in a statement.

""The Secretary-General calls for prompt, effective and transparent investigations into these incidents to ensure accountability.""

The analysis of a 'war crime'

Meanwhile, the Houthi government's health minister, Taha al Motawakel, described the airstrikes as a ""war crime"".

""The coalition (Saudi-led coalition) is targeting civilians, they attacked the detention centre in Saada province that hosts civilian inmates known by the Red Cross and were visited by them, they were directly targeted by Saudi-led coalition aircrafts. Until this moment rescuers are still searching for victims,"" he said.

Image: Damage after an airstrike hit the temporary detention centre in Saada

""We are looking at a very big crime and there is an American green light to kill civilians, that's what we can see through targeting the detention centre in Saada province and the continuous killing of civilians without chasing the convicts or the war criminals.

""We consider this a war crime against humanity. The world should take its responsibility at this critical moment in human history, we are witnessing many victims.""

Saudi officials deny conducting offensive

But the Saudi-led coalition said reports of it targeting the detention centre were untrue, the Saudi official news agency SPA reported on Saturday.

A coalition spokesman said the target in Saada was not on no-targeting lists agreed upon with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, was not reported by the International Committee of the Red Cross and did not meet the standards specified by the Third Geneva Convention for Prisoners of War.

Previously, a GP consultation was needed to gain access to the free, online scheme to help with losing weight.

But now the 12-week plan - including tailored diets and exercise - can be accessed at pharmacies for people with a BMI over 30.

Image: A GP referral was previously needed

More than 50,000 referrals have been made GPs already.

People need to have a body mass index (BMI) over 30 to sign up and are contacted within 10 days to start the programme.

Those from Asian, black and minority ethnic backgrounds can join the programme at a lower BMI of 27.5, due to their increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.

A BMI of 30 would mean someone 5ft 10in (178cm) would weigh 15st or 95kg.

The scale has come under criticism for not including factors like body fat percentage in the past.

As well as diet and exercise plans, the NHS obesity scheme also includes access to apps, and some people can get one-on-one training and support.

Around 60% of adults in England are overweight, and more than a quarter are obese.

Dr Bruce Warner, deputy chief pharmaceutical officer at NHS England, said: ""Obesity is a significant threat to the nation's health - it increases your chance of dying from COVID and puts you at greater risk of stroke, cancer and other deadly disease.

""The NHS's radical action plan means it is now easier for people to take control of their health - adults with obesity can now walk into any high street community pharmacy to take the first step on a life-changing weight loss journey.""

Diabetes is estimated to cost around £10bn for the NHS to treat every year, and around 5% of GP prescriptions are for a diabetes treatment.

Robert Pettifer, a pharmacist in Warwickshire, said: ""Pharmacies play a vital role in the health and wellbeing of our communities, and it's great that we can now refer people to this new weight loss programme.""

Four girls aged between 13 and 17 were targeted in Greenwich, southeast London, amid growing fears the incidents are linked.

Now the Metropolitan Police has released an image of a man they want to question about the assaults.

The first happened on 16 December when a girl, 13, got off a 229 bus on Crossway, near the junction of Hoverton Road.

A man followed her before sexually touching her, then ran away when the victim screamed.

On 12 January a 16-year-old girl was approached by a man in Poplar Place asking for directions before he pushed her against a fence and attacked her.

She screamed and managed to escape.

The following day a 17-year-old girl was trailed as she got off the 422 bus in Artillery Place.

A man followed her to a nearby property, grabbing the back of her leg and causing her to fall - before assaulting her as she lay on the floor.

He fled the scene after the teen shouted for help.

The final incident happened the following week, 16 January, when a girl, 16, was walking down Kentlea Road.

A man asked for directions then attacked her before she had a chance to run away.

Earlier inquiries led police to link the incidents on 12 and 13 January.

There will now be an increased police presence in the area.

Safer schools sergeant, Geoff Warren, said in a statement: ""Enquiries have led us to believe the same suspect committed both sexual assaults.

""Although I do not wish to cause alarm to anyone I feel it is important for parents, guardians and children to be aware of these incidents and take reasonable measures to ensure our children are safe.""

He urged people to stick to busy, well-lit areas if possible and urged anyone who feels uncomfortable by someone's actions to call police: ""You will not be wasting our time and we will take your call seriously.""

Detective Sergeant James Robinson, who is leading the investigation, called on anyone with information to come forward.

""We know these incidents will cause concern within the community and we are doing all we can to identify the person responsible.

""We are also asking for your help - if you recognise the man in this image or have any information that could assist us, no matter how small, then contact us as soon as possible.""

Jason Rivera, 22, died while responding to a call from a mother saying she was fighting with one of her sons.

The gunman was shot by a third officer at the scene and taken to hospital in critical condition. He was previously incorrectly reported to have died.

It means a total of four NYPD officers have been shot in the past week - although Mr Rivera was the only fatal incident.

The NYPD has identified the shooter as Lashawn McNeil, 47.

How the incident unfolded

The team of three officers responded to the call about a domestic incident at around 6.15pm on Friday.

A mother had said she was fighting with one of her sons.

When they arrived at the one-bedroom flat, they spoke to the woman and another one of her sons in the front.

Mr Rivera and a colleague then started to walk down a narrow, 10-metre corridor towards the bedroom.

At this point the bedroom door opened and a man opened fire, hitting both officers.

As the shooter tried to leave the flat, the third officer fired two shots, hitting the suspect in the arm and head.

NYPD sources told NBC news the third officer was a new member of the force.

A Glock .45 pistol, with a magazine capable of holding 40 rounds, was recovered by detectives at the scene. The NYPD said it was stolen in Baltimore in 2017.

Investigators said the incident was recorded on body-worn cameras.

NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said: ""Tonight, a 22-year-old son, husband, officer and friend was killed because he did what we asked him to do.

""We are in mourning and we are angry.""

Alongside Mr Rivera and his colleague, two other officers have been shot in the last seven days. One officer was hit in the leg while scuffling with a teenager.

Mr Bryant's comments came after William Wragg, the senior Tory MP who first raised concerns about attempted ""blackmail"" by Downing Street, revealed he was to meet police about his allegations.

MPs should operate 'without fear or favour'

Mr Bryant said he had spoken to ""about a dozen"" Conservatives in recent days who had either been threatened by government whips with having cash cut from their constituencies or promised funding if they voted 'the right way'.

""I have even heard MPs alleging that the prime minister himself has been doing this,"" Mr Bryant told the BBC.

""What I have said to all of those people is that I think that is misconduct in public office. The people who should be dealing with such allegations are the police.

""We are not the United States. We don't run a 'pork barrel' system. It is illegal.

""We are meant to operate as MPs without fear or favour.

""The allocation of taxpayer funding to constituencies should be according to need, not according to the need to keep the prime minister in his job.""

Boris Johnson facing fresh danger

Bury South MP Christian Wakeford, who this week defected to Labour, has described how Tory whips had warned him over funding for a new school in his constituency if he rebelled in a vote over free school meals.

Ministers have sought to dismiss the claims, insisting the whips had no role in the allocation of public funding.

While his defection appeared to have put the plotting on hold, the publication of the report by Sue Gray, the senior civil servant investigating lockdown parties in Number 10 and elsewhere in Whitehall, poses renewed danger to the PM.

Following the latest round of testing, none of the residents has coronavirus.

Good news, you might think.

But visiting - already suspended for two weeks - will remain forbidden.

Thus, none of the residents - all triple jabbed - is infected, and only a few of them (some special circumstances apply) can see their family.

Image: Andy and his mum shortly before the pandemic

The catch, at my mum's care home, is that some members of staff are positive.

Under rules that have been in place for months, two positive tests among either residents, or staff, mean at least 14 days of restricted visiting.

If, on the 13th day, a new case appears, then the period of enforced isolation rolls on.

Partly because the Omicron variant is so transmissible, some care homes have effectively been in lockdown since before Christmas.

The group Rights for Residents campaigns for better access.

Some of the stories on its Twitter feed are harrowing.

One person said: ""Spoke to my dad on the phone. He said hello, my heart melted. Not seen (him) for five weeks now.""

Another wrote: ""Mum's care home - one of the carers' children has COVID so home locked down for 14 days, no visitors. If another child diagnosed, 14 days starts again. This is cruel!!!!""

My mum's home - as frustrated by the rules as my sister and me are - has offered us a ""pod visit"".

Almost two years since the first lockdown, we are being given the opportunity to ""visit"" our 84-year-old mother, who has severe dementia and does not speak anymore, through a pane of glass.

For a visit to be meaningful we need to get close. While we are not sure that mum recognises us, a hug or a hand placed gently on her shoulder are things that bring her comfort. And we hope that perhaps, on a deep, instinctive level, she does still know who we are.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in the Commons on Wednesday that Health Secretary Sajid Javid would be updating plans for care homes in the ""coming days"".

Residents and their families are hoping the two infection rule will be dropped.

His friend was taken to hospital with serious injuries and was said to be in a critical condition.

The suspected murder weapon was recovered at the scene.

Police said the alleged attacker was a local resident and had been found hiding later in the nearby property of a relative.

Omicron was first picked up by technicians in a laboratory in South Africa. A few weeks later, a handful of doctors at the main hospital in the country's capital, Pretoria, provided the first analysis of its behaviour after admitting dozens of new COVID patients.

It was at that point that Steve Biko Academic Hospital's Dr Fareed Abdullah told the world that Omicron was not like the variants which fuelled previous waves.

Live COVID updates from UK and around the world

Image: The country is emerging from the Omicron wave

The strain was highly infectious but it was significantly less likely to put people in hospital - or cost them their lives. Major studies in the UK and US on the severity of the disease have confirmed these initial observations made in South Africa.

""Are we closer to the end of this wave than the beginning?"" I asked.

""The data is showing that we're right at the end of the wave, our case rates are almost where they were pre-wave level, we really have a view now of the whole wave and can describe it properly,"" said Dr Abdullah, as he stripped off his protective garments outside the hospital's ICU ward.

Yet there is another issue now concerning this clinician and the rest of the medical community in South Africa.

Seroprevalence surveys indicate that more than three-quarters of the population have already generated immunity from previous COVID-19 infections - one reason why Dr Abdullah and others think the fall-out from Omicron was relatively mild.

However, there is one group who are thought to be at particular risk - any of the millions of people in South Africa who suffer from weakened immune systems, like those with HIV.

HIV is a key public health concern in South Africa with an estimated eight million people (13% of the population) living with the disease. There is tried and tested medicine for this, called antiretrovirals. It keeps HIV at bay, thereby allowing the body's immune system to function normally. But patients need to take the medication consistently.

When South Africa's hardy yet overworked health system shifted to address the COVID pandemic, the work of diagnosing people with HIV - and maintaining contact with those who already have the virus - was neglected.

Image: Steve Biko Academic Hospital's Dr Fareed Abdullah

Public health organisations like Right to Care estimate that some 3.6 million have either gone undiagnosed or are not currently on a consistent antiretroviral regime.

""In South Africa, we want to make sure that more and more people with HIV get into treatment so they don't fall into that category, but in my humble opinion, that is where the epidemic is shifting now,"" says Dr Abdullah.

Finding and reintegrating those carrying the HIV virus into the system is just one part of the challenge however.

New strains could evolve

Early on in the pandemic, scientists discovered that the immunocompromised tend to suffer from particularly long and severe COVID infections with prolonged periods of infectiousness.

In addition, work done by scientists in Durban has shown how COVID can mutate inside the bodies of those with untreated HIV. In one case, they traced a coronavirus sample to a 36-year-old HIV patient who was struggling to adhere to her antiretroviral treatment regime. Over the course of her seven-month COVID infection, the virus acquired 32 mutations.

The risk is clear. New variants of concern could evolve - and be transmitted - by those with weakened immune systems.

""It means a major reorganisation of the health service because these people are difficult to find. How do you make the diagnosis in these people? But that is where modern medicine has to take us, rapidly,"" says Dr Fareed Abdullah.

In a town called Klerksdorp in South Africa's North West Province, health workers are trying to re-establish contact with dozens of HIV patients who have fallen off the local health authority's radar.

Image: New variants of concern could evolve - and be transmitted - by those with weakened immune systems

'I was so sick'

A 40-year-old woman called Sylvia van Wyk stopped taking antiretroviral tablets two years ago - and when she picked up COVID, she couldn't get rid of it.

""I was so sick, I couldn't do nothing, nothing at all, my mum was there for me, she was washing me, feeding me, I couldn't do nothing for myself, nothing,"" she said.

Sylvia had COVID for three agonising months but when she re-started her HIV treatment, her body fought the virus off.

""Why did you stop taking (your antiretrovirals)?"" I asked.

""Truly speaking, I was entertaining too much, I was entertaining, I wasn't taking care of my health,"" she said.

South African scientists warn that it is crucial that people like Sylvia continue to take their HIV treatments for fear of the development of some, ""really nasty variants,"" in the words of one leading figure.

Frontline employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with two jabs by 1 April, meaning they must have had their first vaccine dose by 3 February.

Ahead of the deadline, NHS workers held protests in London and other cities across the country in opposition to the compulsory vaccination policy.

Loss of workers could have 'massive consequences'

Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said compulsory vaccination for health professionals in England was ""not the right way forward"".

While the majority of staff had been vaccinated, up to 80,000 (around 10%) had not been.

Mr Marshall told the BBC that losing so many workers from the frontline would have ""massive consequences"" for the NHS.

But a delay would allow time for booster jabs and a ""sensible conversation"" about whether vaccines should be mandatory at all, he added.

Deputy lead for the NHS COVID vaccination programme Dr Nikki Kanani said: ""Mandatory vaccination is a government policy but as healthcare professionals we all have a duty to make sure that we are protected, to make sure that our colleagues and our patients are protected.

""I know that our teams will be doing everything they can to continue to have vaccine confidence building conversations and offering that all important vaccination to staff who are yet to have their first, second or their booster dose.""

When asked about staff protests against mandatory vaccination, she said: ""I think it's a really difficult time for some people to make a decision that is fundamentally about protecting them and their families and their communities.

""So, if you're marching today, just take a moment, think about the people that you've been looking after who have experienced COVID, think about your colleagues who you've been working with, and think about the best way to make sure that we're all protected, and that we're all as safe as possible, because we are very much in this together and it's down to us to look after each other too.""

Healthcare workers have a 'professional responsibility'

Earlier this week, a number of Conservative MPs called on Boris Johnson to rethink plans to make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory for NHS workers.

Danny Kruger, Sir Desmond Swayne, and former ministers Esther McVey, Mark Harper and Andrew Murrison all called for the policy to be reviewed.

The prime minister said that the move was supported by the NHS, had increased vaccine uptake among NHS staff, and that healthcare workers had a ""professional responsibility"" to get the jab.

However, he added: ""We will reflect on the way ahead. We don't want to drive people out of the service.""

""Our people... they need peace, they need music.... we have to help them,"" he insists.

When the Taliban were first in power over two decades ago they banned all forms of music-making other than religious singing.

Since reassuming control of Afghanistan, they've introduced a ban on music in public places and videos on social media - and while not possible to independently verify - some footage appears to show musicians with bruises and torn clothes and musical instruments being smashed with rocks.

""Honestly, when I saw that, it felt like they are burning my heart,"" Sakhi says.

""Behind music there is [so much] history... generation after generation... we have so many great songs and I think people, they need it.""

Photos he shows of the musicians he used to know, now have to be blurred to protect their identity.

""Teachers and students were afraid of going back to school and doing musical activities. The Taliban actually officially announced that the musicians had to change their profession, so they're not allowed to perform, they're not allowed to do any musical event. They are afraid.""

Sidiqi says he receives daily phone calls from musicians in hiding who can't afford to eat because they can't earn any money.

In a highly-unusual move that appeared to be based on specially declassified intelligence, the Foreign Office alleged that a former Ukrainian MP was ""being considered as a potential candidate"" as a new leader in what would be a significant escalation of the crisis.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is the current leader of Ukraine. He would like his country to join the European Union and the NATO defence alliance.

What's going on at Russia-Ukraine border?

""We have information that indicates the Russian government is looking to install a pro-Russian leader in Kyiv as it considers whether to invade and occupy Ukraine,"" the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said in a brief statement. It did not elaborate further on how this plan would be achieved.

The claims came as Boris Johnson cautioned against being ""naive"" when dealing with President Vladimir Putin following weeks of dialogue between Russia and Western allies to try to resolve the crisis over Ukraine and wider European security.

""The Prime Minister's view is that the situation in Ukraine is the biggest test to the unity and resolve of the West and the NATO alliance in decades,"" a Downing Street source said.

""It would be frankly naive to assume that Russia could be mollified by changes to the European security architecture - the Kremlin's behaviour has made that consistently clear.""

The source said Mr Johnson regards the stand-off as ""gravely dangerous"" and is being briefed on the situation daily.

He is expected to tell Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, to accept an invitation to meet with the Russian defence minister in Moscow in the coming days.

As well as warning of a de facto coup plot, the Foreign Office claimed to have information that Russia's intelligence services maintain links with ""numerous"" former Ukrainian politicians, including ex-prime ministers and a chief of staff to former president Viktor Yanukovych.

Image: Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned President Putin against invading Ukraine, saying it would be a 'massive strategic mistake'

""Some of these have contact with Russian intelligence officers currently involved in the planning for an attack on Ukraine,"" it said.

The Foreign Office did not provide evidence to support the allegations given the secretive nature of its sources.

Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said: ""The information being released today shines a light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine, and is an insight into Kremlin thinking.""

Sky News understands that Britain's spy agencies are being encouraged to do more with what they know at a time when information can be a powerful tool to expose the schemes of an opponent.

Ms Truss added in the statement: ""Russia must de-escalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy. As the UK and our partners have said repeatedly, any Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be a massive strategic mistake with severe costs.""

Information is being used as a tactic by both sides to undermine the other or gain an advantage as tensions between Russia and Western allies mount over Ukraine and wider European security.

It is a form of virtual conflict that takes place in a grey zone under the threshold of war.

The Foreign Office statement named the former Ukrainian MP who it alleged was being considered by Russia as a potential future Ukrainian leader as Yevhen Murayev.

Image: Russia has sparked concern that it may be planning an invasion on Ukraine

It was not immediately possible to get a response from Mr Murayev to the claim.

The former politician lost his seat in the Ukrainian parliament when his party failed to secure 5% of the vote in elections in 2019.

He has reportedly spoken out in the past in support of Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

The Foreign Office also named former Ukrainian politicians that Russian spies allegedly maintained contact with as Serhiy Arbuzov, an acting prime minister in 2014, Mykola Azarov, a former prime minister, Andriy Kluyev, a chief of staff to Mr Yanukovich and Vladimir Sivkovich, a former deputy head of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council.

Mr Sivkovich was called out earlier in the week by the US government, which also accused the Russian government of influence operations to destabilise Ukraine.

The US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on a total of four Ukrainian officials, with Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, accusing them of being at the heart of an effort that began in 2020 ""to degrade the ability of the Ukrainian state to independently function"".

The UK allegations emerged as Mr Johnson was expected to increase pressure on Russia this week, with Whitehall departments preparing to stand-up specialist counter-disinformation cells.

This kind of activity also happened in the wake of the Novichok nerve agent attack against a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in Salisbury in 2018.

The UK blamed Russia for the attempted double murder - an allegation that Moscow denied. Russian media then amplified the denials as well as baseless, counter-allegations that the UK was to blame.

Now, that has changed; Omicron is omnipresent in both countries and, after hesitating for a short while, the French have reopened their border to British tourists. Many of those now crossing are heading towards the Alps.

The only country that sends more tourists to the French Alps than Britain is France itself. In Chamonix, it's reckoned that around one in four people on the slopes is British; in other resorts, the ratio is even higher.

What that means is that there are plenty of businesses in these mountains who depend on the Brits. And when they stopped coming, those businesses started to worry.

Image: Ski school founder Shona Tate says her Chamonix business depends on UK tourists being allowed to return

Shona Tate was among the nervous. She helped to found a ski school in Chamonix 18 years ago, but says that the past two years have been the hardest time they've faced. She told me that her business depended on British tourists being allowed to return.

""If the restrictions hadn't been lifted then we wouldn't have been able to survive,"" she said. ""You need cash flow to keep going. At the moment, we're not even paying ourselves.

""The whole industry has taken a hit, and it hasn't been pleasant. But as soon as the announcement came out that people could return, well we got some lovely messages from clients. They were delighted for us, and they wanted to know if they could come.

""I'm looking forward to Easter - I think it will be so much easier. Who knows what's ahead but we will keep positive at the moment.""

Not everything has been answered. Visitors still need to take a COVID test before arriving, and unvaccinated tourists are not welcomed. The question of whether children need to have a vaccine passport has still not been resolved - but it looks very likely that they won't.

Above us, the sky is blue and cloudless. It is the perfect day to be on the slopes; you couldn't wish for a better advert.

Giles Bickford leans on the balcony of his chalet and points up to Mont Blanc, looming beyond us. The chalet is rented out to groups of tourists, mostly British, for fully-catered holidays. It's booked up for most of the rest of the year, but those bookings were all likely to be cancelled if tourists were barred from entering France.

""It's completely saved our season,"" he told me. ""We can survive and save our season. Without the change this week, without British tourists, it would have been hard to pay the bills this year.

""As it's happened, by getting this change in the middle of January, we can survive. Any later and it would have been touch and go.""

There is a shared feeling here - that disaster has been averted, and that the opportunity now exists to move away from the economic impact of the pandemic and its ongoing travel restrictions. That having survived the storm, it is time to reap the benefits.

Up on the mountain, the sun is beating down, creating that curious blend of refreshing cold and pleasant warmth that you sometimes get on a ski slope. The runs are not packed, but they are about to get busier.

The Electric in Birmingham dates back to 1909 but enforced closure at the start of the pandemic led to it remaining shut for almost 22 months before finally reopening to the public this week.

It was taken over last year by Kevin Markwick, who also owns The Uckfield Picture House in East Sussex. He's worked in the industry for his whole life and has never feared for the future of cinema like he has over the past two years.

Image: The iconic Electric originally opened in 1909

""This has been the biggest existential crisis we've ever faced,"" he says.

""Not only were we obviously financially strapped all the way through because no money was coming in, but you've still got to pay all the outgoings the film distributors rather went with indecent haste to home entertainment, streaming and things like that so it wasn't entirely clear that we would have a steady supply of films when we came back.""

When Universal's Trolls World Tour went straight to streaming in April 2020 it was the first major studio film to skip its planned cinema release.

With cinemas closed, the industry was crippled. Before the pandemic in 2019 UK box office revenue exceeded £1.25bn. In 2020 it plummeted to just under £300m.

Delays to the release dates of big blockbusters added to the industry's woes.

When the latest Bond film, No Time to Die, was eventually released last year it was the first sign of a revival. Spider-Man: No Way Home has also proved popular at the box office.

In 2021 UK box office revenue rose slightly to over £556m, an encouraging sign in a year when cinemas were closed for several months of lockdown, but still well short of pre-pandemic revenue.

Image: Roger Shannon, a visiting professor of British Cinema Histories at Birmingham City University, says 'the appetite for cinema hasn't gone away'

Roger Shannon, a visiting professor of British Cinema Histories at Birmingham City University, believes the industry can be optimistic about the future, despite changes in the way people enjoy films.

""I think the pandemic has accelerated that technological change and streamers have become more prominent,"" he says.

""Of course we're all watching movies from our sofas… but I don't think it's an either-or situation.

""Streamers are really revitalising, recalibrating and reinvesting into the studio infrastructure in the UK, which I think augers well for the long-term.

""I think cinema numbers will recover because I think that the appetite for cinema hasn't gone away and I think cinema will rebound with incredibly new ways of telling stories and I think the technological revolution means the stories will be told in different ways.""

Mr Markwick shares that optimism.

""It's a completely different experience,"" he says. ""It doesn't matter how big your TV is - you still need to get out of the house from time to time.""

Image: Katie Marwick, the manager of The Electric, says interest in the reopening of the cinema has exceeded her expectations

His daughter Katie, who is the cinema's manager, doesn't think streaming poses the threat others view it as.

""It's probably not even a case of competing I don't think to be honest because I think we can both exist in the same world,"" she says.

""Watching a film in a cinema is completely different to watching it at home by yourself or with your family because watching a film in a cinema is such a communal experience. It all just builds and creates this amazing atmosphere.""

But she accepts that in order to thrive in 2022, they're in the hands of the filmmakers.

""We need the films that were supposed to come out in 2020 to actually finally come out,"" she says.

""Big blockbusters which will really coax people back into the cinema and big blockbusters that are only being shown in cinemas to begin with.""

Taking over such an iconic cinema brings with it the responsibility of continuing over a century of success. But so far the signs are good. Interest in the reopening of the cinema has exceeded her expectations.

""Everyone's really excited with the phone ringing off the hook with everyone saying 'when are you open? When can I come back?' I think people are looking forward to it,"" she says.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220123020723/http://news.sky.com/story/uks-oldest-cinema-reopens-after-biggest-existential-crisis-ever-faced-by-the-industry-12521574;

Matthew Willson, 31, travelled from Chertsey, Surrey to visit partner Katherine Shepard on the outskirts of Atlanta, Georgia.

But just three days after he arrived in the US, the astrophysicist was shot in what has been described a ""random act"" involving the ""reckless discharge of firearms"".

He died after a bullet pierced the wall of a neighbouring block of flats in Brookhaven, a city in the suburbs of northeast Atlanta, on 16 January, authorities said.

Ms Shepard, who had been dating Mr Willson for three years, recalled the moments leading up to the tragedy which claimed his life.

""He was supposed to be here for three months because we've been long distance for a while,"" she told network WSB-TV.

""I picked him up from the airport, took him to his favourite eating location, and the next day, he's gone.""

The couple woke up on 16 January to the sound of more than 30 gunshots coming from an apartment complex directly behind Ms Shepard's.

A bullet travelled through her wall, hitting Mr Willson, she said.

Ms Shepard called the police who had already been deployed to the area after the shots were fired.

""I held him for another 20 minutes while we waited for the ambulance,"" she said.

""And while we were waiting, there were more gunshots fired.""

Mr Willson suffered a single gunshot wound to the head and was rushed to hospital but could not be saved.

He has been described as a ""much-loved"" member of the astrophysics team at the University of Exeter.

""Matthew Willson was a former PhD student at the University of Exeter and much-loved member of our astrophysics team,"" a university spokesman said in a statement.

""We have been informed about his tragic death in the US and our hearts go out to his family, friends and colleagues. We are offering support to colleagues at the university who will also want to commemorate his life.""

No arrests have yet been announced and police have appealed to the public for help to find those responsible.

1525;1525;Video games that diagnose, monitor and treat depression developed by scientists;Sunday 23 January 2022 02:22, UK;['aisha zahid', '@aishazahid'];['mental health', 'depression', 'video games'];['diagnose', 'patients', 'monitor', 'sky', 'help', 'told', 'diagnosis', 'games', 'video', 'scientists', 'depression', 'actually', 'thymia', 'treat', 'developed'];"Scientists have developed video games using AI technology to diagnose, monitor and treat depression.

The platform, called Thymia, aims to make depression and other mental health conditions as measurable as physical ailments.

Dr Emilia Molimpakis, CEO and co-founder of Thymia, told Sky News: ""Right now the existing system is flawed in many ways, GPs don't have time, the existing systems they have are subjective questionnaires that are incredibly biased and there's no follow-up between appointments.

Image: Software analyses the patient's voice, eye gaze and micro-expressions along behavioural measures

""Thymia is the first system that offers objectivity and uses several types of data in order to create a really accurate and robust model of depression.""

The programme asks patients to play simple video games, with a neuropsychological underpinning, ultimately designed to measure depressive cues.

While playing the games, the software analyses the patient's voice, eye gaze and micro-expressions as well as behavioural measures including reaction times, memory and error rates.

Through this, patterns indicative of depression are picked up on, allowing a diagnosis to be made quickly.

As it is designed to monitor patients in the long-term, patients can play games in-between appointments, helping identify whether treatments are working over time.

Image: Dr Emilia Molimpakis is hopeful the Thymia programme will help clinicians achieve a diagnosis for depression much faster

Dr Molimpakis said: ""What we hope to achieve is to help clinicians achieve the right diagnosis much faster - currently it takes years, we want to reduce that to weeks - and also help them find the right treatment for each individual patient.""

Posy Parsons first began to experience symptoms of depression in her mid-20s.

Currently, diagnostic tools used to diagnose depression involve patients scoring their feelings - something Ms Parsons struggled with.

Already facing challenges at the time, getting a diagnosis came with its own challenges.

She told Sky News: ""All the doctor receives is that one form and they've got no context of what else is going on and all the different complexities of the situation.

""You really feel like it is this quick snapshot and then they're judging and making potential huge consequences for your life based on that.""

She says being able to see the objective measurements of depression would ""help recognise that it's a real thing"" - and would help her keep track of her own mental wellbeing.

Thymia has been trialled by around 2,000 patients at University College London and King's College London, with clinical trials beginning later this year.

But there is concern over whether the technology will have the desired effect, with some saying the root of the problem needs to be the primary focus.

Dr Lucy Johnstone, a consultant clinical psychologist, told Sky News: ""It's a fair point to say we're not very good at picking up, or understanding or supporting people who are feeling depressed.

""I'm just not sure this is the answer.

""A quick check list is not going to tell you a great deal but nor is sitting down through a video game of some sort that looks at your eye gaze.

""I actually think as a psychologist what we need to find out more is the reasons people are feeling the way they are.

""We actually know a lot about the life circumstances that lead people to become depressed.

""We actually need a human being sitting down and asking you more about those events in your lives, that's actually what's going to help us understand people better.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220123040917/https://news.sky.com/story/video-games-that-diagnose-monitor-and-treat-depression-developed-by-scientists-12521681;

She made the announcement after nine cases of the Omicron variant were detected in a single-family that flew to Auckland earlier this month.

From Monday, New Zealanders will face strict coronavirus restrictions and the prime minister herself has been forced to delay her wedding to long-time partner Clarke Gayford.

The wedding was expected to take place next weekend at Gisborne on the North Island's eastern coast.

""Such is life,"" Ms Ardern said.

""I am no different to, dare I say it, thousands of other New Zealanders who have had much more devastating impacts felt by the pandemic, the most gutting of which is the inability to be with a loved one sometimes when they are gravely ill. That will far, far outstrip any sadness I experience.""

New Zealand had been among the few remaining countries to have avoided any outbreaks of the Omicron variant, but Ms Ardern acknowledged last week that a new wave was inevitable given the transmissibility of the variant.

The country managed to contain the Delta variant, with an average of about 20 new cases each day but, since it opened its borders in November, it has seen an increase in people arriving into the country and going into mandatory quarantine who are infected with Omicron.

That has put a strain on the quarantine system and prompted the government to limit access for returning citizens while it decides what to do about reopening its borders.

What is the 'red setting'?

The ""red setting"" of New Zealand's pandemic response includes heightened measures such as mandatory mask-wearing and limits on social gatherings.

Businesses and schools remain open and domestic travel can continue but vaccine passports are required for entry to most non-essential businesses.

Up to 100 vaccinated people can gather under a red alert but the prime minister said her wedding would not proceed in a restricted form.

Ms Ardern stressed that ""red is not lockdown"", adding: ""Our plan for managing Omicron cases in the early stage remains the same as Delta, where we will rapidly test, contact trace and isolate cases and contacts in order to slow the spread.""

About 93% of New Zealanders aged 12 and over are fully vaccinated and 52% have had a booster jab.

Mr Wakeford opposed the motion but he chose to abstain from the Commons vote.

Ian Alexander Jr was a musician and DJ who often accompanied his mother to red carpet events, and both were big champions of each other's work.

A spokesperson for King confirmed his death was suicide and shared a family statement, saying: ""Our family is devastated at the deepest level by the loss of Ian.

""He is such a bright light who cared so deeply about the happiness of others. Our family asks for respectful consideration during this private time.""

King is best known for her Emmy-winning role in the TV series Watchmen and for films including 2018's If Beale Street Could Talk - for which she won her Oscar and also a Golden Globe for best supporting actress - and 2021's The Harder They Fall alongside Idris Elba. She also directed the Oscar-nominated One Night In Miami, released in 2020.

Her son's father is her former husband, record producer Ian Alexander Sr. The pair divorced in 2007 after 10 years of marriage.

Ian Alexander Jr performed under the name ""desduné,"" according to his Instagram page, and his most recent single, Green Eyes, was released on 7 January, Sky News affiliate NBC reports.

Earlier in January, he shared a birthday message to King and said: ""To have you as my mother is the greatest gift I could ask for."" Speaking to E! News at the Golden Globes in 2019, he described the star as a ""super mom"".

He continued: ""She doesn't really let bad work days or anything come back and ruin the time that we have. It's really awesome to have a mother who I can enjoy spending time with.""

The pair had matching tattoos reading ""unconditional love"" in Aramaic. In an interview with People, King had previously called her son ""an amazing young man"".

Stars including Janet Jackson and Octavia Spencer were among those sharing tributes and messages of support for King online.

Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, shared her ""deepest condolences and prayers for strength"" to King on Twitter, and said: ""Sending back to her all the warmth and light and support she has extended to me and to so many others.""

Vice admiral Kay-Achim Schoenbach made the comments at a think-tank discussion in India on Friday, coming at a sensitive time as Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on Ukraine's borders.

Diplomatic efforts are focused on preventing an escalation despite Russia denying it is planning to invade Ukraine.

At the discussion in New Delhi on Friday, Mr Schoenbach said President Putin seeks to be treated as an equal by the West.

""What he (Putin) really wants is respect,"" he said. ""And my God, giving someone respect is low cost, even no cost... It is easy to give him the respect he really demands - and probably also deserves.""

Mr Schoenbach conceded Russia's actions in Ukraine needed to be addressed, but he added that ""the Crimea peninsula is gone, it will never come back, this is a fact"", contradicting the joint Western position that Moscow's annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 cannot be accepted and must be reversed.

His remarks, which were published on YouTube and widely circulated on German media, were publicly rejected by the German defence ministry which said Mr Schoenbach's views did not reflect the nation's position in either content or wording.

Announcing his resignation on Saturday evening, Mr Schoenbach said: ""My rash remarks in India... are increasingly putting a strain on my office.

""I consider this step (the resignation) necessary to avert further damage to the German navy, the German forces, and, in particular, the Federal Republic of Germany.""

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Mr Schoenbach's comments could impair Western efforts to de-escalate the situation.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said separately in a tweet: ""Ukraine is grateful to Germany for the support it has already provided since 2014, as well as for the diplomatic efforts to resolve the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict.

""But Germany's current statements are disappointing and run counter to that support and effort.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220123090738/https://news.sky.com/story/german-navy-chief-resigns-over-ill-considered-ukraine-russia-remarks-12523257;

The deputy prime minister said the UK and other nations will enforce economic and financial sanctions on Moscow if Russia invades Ukraine - as troops mount at the border.

He told Sky News' Trevor Phillips on Sunday: ""We will support them in defending themselves.

""But also, to the international community, to NATO allies in the West, we're standing shoulder to shoulder saying there will be very serious consequences if Russia takes this move to try and invade and also install a puppet regime.""

Mr Raab, asked if the UK would send troops if Russia invade, added: ""It's extremely unlikely we would do that but what we can say is we're already willing and engaging in training programmes to support Ukrainians defending themselves, that's absolutely right.""

Foreign Office accuses Moscow of plot

The deputy PM's comments come after the UK's Foreign Office accused Russia on Saturday night of a shadowy plot to install a pro-Kremlin government in Kyiv.

In a highly unusual move that appeared to be based on specially declassified intelligence, the Foreign Office alleged that a former Ukrainian MP was ""being considered as a potential candidate"" as a new leader in what would be a significant escalation of the crisis.

But Yevhen Murayevm, who owns a television channel in Ukraine, said the accusation against him was ""stupidity and nonsense"".

He said he was ""amused"" by the allegations as he has been under Kremlin-imposed sanctions for four years and is barred from Russia.

However, Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, told Sir Trevor that Mr Murayevm openly appears on his TV channel and provides pro-Russian views.

""He's trying to appeal to Ukrainians who still believe that the Soviet Union and Russia is the best way for Ukraine to develop,"" he said.

'We will fight to the death'

Mr Prystaiko, asked if he thinks Russia will invade Ukraine, said: ""I do believe this, it wouldn't be the first time.

""We will fight to the death, unfortunately so many people in our nation will die but we'll try to get as many Russians, as they come.""

As civilians take part in military training this week after joining the reserves, he added that Ukraine does not have enough of its own troops to defend the border and hopes allies will help if Russia does invade.

Germany should be last in line to block help 'due to world wars'

Mr Prystaiko also hit out at Germany for blocking NATO ally Estonia from giving military support to Ukraine by refusing to issue permits for German-origin weapons to be exported to Kyiv.

The ambassador said: ""If I have somebody from NATO to tell things like that I would expect Germany to be the last ones, so many Ukrainians still remember what Germany did in our part of the globe, in Ukraine especially.

""We're talking about both of the world wars. There is no Ukrainian family that wasn't affected.

""If I have to listen to somebody saying Ukrainians can't have weapons then Germany should be at the end of the line.""

Mr Prystaiko also said Ukraine has asked Germany to halt use of the recently completely Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea, which will provide gas from Russia.

Retired civil engineer Anoosheh Ashoori, 67, has been held in Tehran's Evin prison for the past four-and-a-half years on charges of spying for Israel - allegations he denies.

It is believed he was snatched from the streets of Tehran while on a trip to see his mother.

His family, who live in the UK, want Mr Ashoori to be given ""diplomatic protection"" - like Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - but have said they found the process ""really offensive"".

They believe their loved one is in effect being held hostage as part of the dispute over the longstanding £400m debt the UK owes Iran.

The 67-year-old has written letters to Boris Johnson from his prison cell.

Mr Ashoori's daughter, Elika, has now shared a video on social media, saying her father is going on hunger strike in ""solidarity"" with others such as former US diplomat Barry Rosen - who was one of 52 Americans held hostage in Iran after the Islamic Revolution in 1979, and is currently demonstrating in Vienna - to demand Iran release all foreign and dual-national ""hostages"".

""My father, who has been held hostage by Iran for the past four-and-a-half years, has decided to join their hunger strike from Evin prison,"" Ms Ashoori said in the video posted on Twitter.

""Needless to say, we are extremely concerned for his physical health as he approaches his 68th birthday.

""But having failed to see any progress in the FCDO's [the foreign office] efforts to bring about his release and no sign that the welfare of hostages currently held by Iran is a priority of the respective US, Europe and UK governments, he will begin his hunger strike in the hope of bringing global attention to the plight of these individuals held by Iran.

""Please help us by sharing this message using the hashtag #FreeTheHostages.""

Image: Mr Ashoori's family have campaigned for his release

Mr Rosen began his own hunger strike on Wednesday in Vienna, where there is pressure for countries to make the release of dual-nationality prisoners a condition for the resumption of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) - the 2015 agreement for Iran to limit nuclear activities in exchange for economic sanctions being lifted.

The pact was made with the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - but was suspended under Donald Trump's presidency.

An FCDO spokesperson said: ""Iran's continued detention of Anoosheh Ashoori is wholly unjustified. We call on Iran to end his suffering and allow him to return home to be reunited with his wife and children.

""Iran should free all those British nationals unfairly detained in Iran.

On Friday Portuguese maritime officials found his overturned rowing boat off the coast of the Azores, an autonomous Portuguese archipelago in the North Atlantic.

The TV chef was asked about the issue of foreign cuisines and cultural appropriation in a new interview with the newspaper's Culture supplement.

In 2018, Oliver was forced to defend the name of his ""punchy jerk rice"", claiming it highlighted his culinary inspiration, after facing criticism from Labour's shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler.

In 2014, he came under fire for his interpretation of West African dish Jollof rice.

Speaking to Culture, he reportedly said he now employs ""teams of cultural appropriation specialists"" to ensure he does not make any mistakes.

Standing at the famous Commons spot that has been occupied by generations of politicians, she became the first Muslim woman to speak as a minister from the despatch box.

Colleagues cheered as the Kashmir-born MP got to her feet.

For many, this was the most visual sign of a parliament and a Conservative Party moving into the modern world.

But, two years later she had been removed from her post at the Department for Transport in a mini-reshuffle conducted soon after Boris Johnson's election win.

Ms Ghani now says she was told at the time that her ""Muslimness"" had made colleagues feel uncomfortable.

The East Sussex MP did raise these complaints at the time and is said to have been ""invited"" to make a formal complaint.

However, in an interview with the Sunday Times she says she was told she would have been ""ostracised"" by colleagues and had her ""career destroyed"" if she had pursued the issue.

Image: Nusrat Ghani says she was told that her 'Muslimness' made colleagues feel uncomfortable

The former minister has also expressed concern about the robustness of the internal Conservative Party complaints process.

This is a potentially damaging development for a government fighting accusations of a toxic internal culture and a prime minister who has previously been criticised for his comments about Islam.

An independent investigation into accusations of islamophobia in the Conservative Party - promised by leadership candidates in 2019 and published last year - was widely criticised as a whitewash with its terms of reference set too tight.

Reaction is instructive about the broader health of the government

The accusations made by Ms Ghani have led many to question whether the party has still not fully faced up to internal demons.

But the reaction from senior Tory MPs and cabinet ministers is also instructive about the broader health of the government.

Late on Saturday night, as official Downing Street channels were saying that there would be no investigation until Ms Ghani made a complaint, the education secretary was tweeting his support for an inquiry.

The health secretary has also gone as far as he feasibly can, writing on Twitter that his friend Ms Ghani ""must be heard"".

Image: Chief Whip Mark Spencer says Ms Ghani's allegations relate to him

Contrast those remarks with the robust denial issued by his ministerial colleague, the Chief Whip Mark Spencer, and a difference in tone, if not substance, appears clear.

Senior ministers have been notably more muscular in recent weeks

This could be put down to the seriousness of the accusations, if it wasn't for other instances of Boris Johnson's top team beginning to push in different directions.

On COVID restrictions and tax rises, senior ministers have been notably more muscular in recent weeks.

Further down the party, arguments that - in times of stability - would be shut down by government are beginning to break out into the open.

Frame that in the context of the recent barrage of scandals rolling into No 10, and it's hard not to see a correlation between the waning authority of the prime minister and the increased instability within his administration and party.

Indeed, this is exactly why an increasing number of MPs now believe that even if Mr Johnson can survive the publication of the Gray report this week, the ripples these scandals have sent out will eventually put the prime minister under.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220123173251/https://news.sky.com/story/mps-fear-boris-johnson-will-not-be-able-to-survive-scandals-as-ghanis-claims-expose-instability-in-no-10-12523659;

Gweiran prison, in the city of Hassakeh, is believed to house more than 3,000 suspected Islamic State militants, including hundreds of children.

IS fighters used vehicles and explosives to ram through the prison walls before entering the building with heavy machine guns late last week.

Prison inmates rioted and some took Kurdish guards hostage, while a number of other prison staff were killed.

Syrian Kurdish forces initially said they had defeated the fighters but they later acknowledged that inmates had taken over part of the prison.

Some of the militants staged another attack on the prison on Sunday to try to help members of the group still in charge of parts of the facility.

IS's news agency Amaq said that the militants had helped more than 800 inmates escape and some were continuing to fight Kurdish forces.

While the Kurdish forces said that they had apprehended more than 100 escaped inmates.

A resident near the prison said that warplanes from the western coalition flew over the building early on Sunday, something confirmed by the US Pentagon.

The resident said that the Kurdish forces could be heard calling on the militants to give themselves up.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory For Human Rights said helicopters dropped pamphlets over the city asking residents to report suspicious activities.

It is IS's biggest attack since it lost its last Syrian territory in 2019.

The US-based Human Rights Watch has estimated that Syrian Kurdish forces hold around 12,000 men and boys suspected of being affiliated with Islamic State.

The prime minister's former top adviser will be one of the final people to be interviewed by Ms Gray, the highly experienced civil servant tasked with finding out whether the events broke lockdown rules.

Her findings could have severe ramifications for Boris Johnson, with most of his cabinet saying they would wait for the report to be published before deciding what his fate should be while other Tory MPs have already called for his resignation.

Could Sue Gray report be the end for Boris Johnson?

Several Conservative MPs have confirmed they have submitted letters of no confidence the PM's leadership to the chair of the 1922 Committee, who needs 54 letters before a leadership vote can be called.

Mr Cummings' interview with Ms Gray, reported by the Sunday Times, risks putting the final nail in the coffin for Mr Johnson as PM.

Earlier this week, Mr Johnson's former adviser, who has been ruthless in his assessment of Tory leader, said he would swear an oath that he warned the PM the May 2020 drinks party in the garden of Number 10 would be against the rules.

He claimed the PM misled parliament by saying he did not know it was a work event.

Mr Johnson last week said ""nobody told me"" the Number 10 garden party during lockdown was ""against the rules"".

Official 'warned against' BYOB garden party

On Friday, Ms Gray uncovered a crucial email from an official warning against the May 2020 event in response to an invitation telling people to ""BYOB"" (bring your own booze or bottle) sent by Martin Reynolds, the PM's principal private secretary.

Mr Cummings claimed a ""very senior official"" warned Mr Reynolds that inviting more than 100 staff to the event would break lockdown rules.

It does not confirm if Mr Johnson was told in advance that the gathering would break lockdown rules.

However, Mr Cummings said he discussed the event with Mr Johnson and told him: ""You've got to get a grip of this madhouse,"" but the PM ""waved it aside"".

The report is due to be published next week.

Ms Gray is understood to be considering publishing a limited report of her findings with the names of some individuals who are facing disciplinary action removed.

Deputy PM Dominic Raab said how the report is published ""will be for the prime minister to decide,"" he told the BBC.

The government has also refused to say whether Ms Gray will record or publish the interviews carried out during the investigation.

Ireland expresses concerns about Russian Navy military exercises

Meanwhile, Ireland has raised concerns about planned Russian Navy military exercises that are due to take place at the start of February.

The artillery drills will take place in international waters but within Irish-controlled airspace and the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

All civilian aircraft will be routed away from the area while the exercises take place.

In compliance with legal requirements, Russia has informed Ireland's aviation authorities of the planned drills in advance.

The Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee which is scrutinising the government's draft Online Safety Bill says the legislation is currently neither clear nor robust enough to tackle some forms of illegal and harmful content.

In its report published today, the committee calls on the government to address types of content that are technically legal such as parts of child abuse sequences known as ""breadcrumbing"" or tech-enabled ""nudifying"" and deepfake pornography.

The MPs want such content to be brought into scope either through primary legislation or as types of harmful content covered by the duties of care.

'A missed opportunity'

""In its current form what should be world-leading, landmark legislation instead represents a missed opportunity,"" said Julian Knight MP, chair of the DCMS Committee.

""The Online Safety Bill neither protects freedom of expression nor is it clear nor robust enough to tackle illegal and harmful online content. Urgency is required to ensure that some of the most pernicious forms of child sexual abuse do not evade detection because of a failure in the online safety law.""

Frankie Thomas was just 15 when she took her own life after reading graphic online content relating to self-harm and suicide.

""I cannot convey the shock,"" her mother Judy told Sky News. ""And that's it, final, it's the end of the story. It's just like that. We knew she had special needs and she was diagnosed with autism when she was five. But we had no idea this was in her mind.""

Frankie had high-functioning autism and attended a special educational needs school. An inquest into her death heard that she was at risk of impulsive behaviour and was vulnerable to suggestion.

Image: Frankie Thomas, 15, was vulnerable to suggestion, an inquest into her death heard

The government says its Online Safety Bill is setting a gold standard for internet safety.

'The bill will make the UK the safest place to go online'

A spokesperson for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport told Sky News: ""We do not agree with the criticism of the committee. The bill has strict measures, including a duty of care to stamp out child sexual abuse, grooming and illegal and harmful content.

""There are also stringent rules to make sure tech firms and Ofcom protect people's free speech and privacy, so content is not taken down without good reason.

""The bill will make the UK the safest place to go online while protecting freedom of speech.""

'Draft bill falls short of quite a lot'

Laura Lyons, who set up the private investigations company Are They Safe, says there remain significant issues surrounding online safety.

""I don't think the draft bill is robust enough,"" she told Sky News.

""I think there needs to be a lot more protection for victims of domestic abuse, sharing of personal photos, a lot more protection for women and girls. We're heading in the right direction but I think it falls short of quite a lot.""

Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

Members of the DCMS Committee say the bill, as currently drafted, has not got the balance right between protecting freedom of expression and tackling harmful content.

What are the committee's recommendations?

Among their recommendations, they have proposed the government make the broader definitions of harm compatible with international human rights law and provide greater clarity within the bill on plans to provide Ofcom as regulator with powers and users with redress.

A revised piece of legislation is expected in the coming months.

But Iraqi-born al Swealmeen falsely claimed to be of Syrian heritage in asylum applications and his request was rejected, a coroner's court heard last month.

The 32-year-old had challenged the Home Office decision by lodging an appeal but it was dismissed in 2015, a copy of the court ruling obtained following requests by the Press Association, the BBC, and The Times showed.

It also detailed how al Swealmeen had been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Born in Baghdad, he had been in prison in the Middle East for a serious assault and had been convicted previously in Liverpool for possession of an offensive weapon.

He was still a practising Muslim, despite converting to Christianity once in the UK, and had lived in accommodation provided by the Home Office until he started renting a flat in Rutland Avenue, Liverpool, in April last year, the coroner's court was told.

No 'well-founded fear of persecution' found

When reviewing al Swealmeen's appeal, Home Office officials decided he had not established a ""well-founded fear of persecution so that he did not qualify for asylum"".

They added he had not demonstrated ""substantial grounds"" to qualify for humanitarian protection and court documents showed he had been informed of the ""decision to remove him from the United Kingdom"".

The judge noted there were ""a number of problems"" with his evidence and, considering al Swealmeen's credibility, said the appellant had ""attempted to give an account to put himself in the best light"".

""In view of all the evidence, I reject his account of events in Syria and his fears on his return in their entirety, and dismiss his asylum appeal,"" the judge said.

Al Swealmeen did not attend the hearing and the solicitors representing him had withdrawn from the case.

Another asylum claim submitted in January 2021

In January last year, al Swealmeen submitted another asylum appeal, which was still outstanding at the time of the attack in November.

This suggests he had recently submitted a fresh asylum claim to the Home Office which had also been refused.

Home Office refuses to answer questions

The department has repeatedly refused to answer questions about the case or explain why al Swealmeen was not removed from the UK when his asylum claim and appeal was were rejected.

A spokesperson told the Press Association: ""The New Plan for Immigration will require people to raise all protection-related issues upfront to tackle the practice of making multiple and sequential claims and enable the removal of those with no right to be in our country more quickly"".

1570;1570;George Floyd murder: Three former police officers go on trial accused of violating black man's civil rights;Monday 24 January 2022 03:15, UK;[];['george floyd'];['murder', 'trial', 'violating', 'mr', 'george', 'floyds', 'black', 'think', 'guilty', 'officers', 'floyd', 'civil', 'mans', 'derek', 'rights'];"Three former Minneapolis police officers who were on the scene of George Floyd's murder in May 2020 go on trial in a US federal court today.

Former officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng stand accused of violating Mr Floyd's civil rights by failing to administer medical aid to him. Kueng and Thao are also charged with failing to intervene when Derek Chauvin knelt on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.

Both counts allege the officers' actions resulted in Mr Floyd's death.

The viral video footage of the killing shows Kueng kneeling on Mr Floyd's back and Lane holding down his legs. Thao is seen keeping bystanders from intervening.

What happens today - and what are prosecutors trying to prove?

Opening arguments will be heard today, and Judge Paul Magnuson has told the court the trial could last for about a month.

Prosecutors will try to prove that all three defendants willingly denied Mr Floyd his constitutional rights - by depriving him of his liberty without due process of law.

Lawyer Ben Crump, who represents Mr Floyd's family, tweeted: ""Derek Chauvin's knee was on George Floyd's neck, but the other three officers aided and abetted in his death. They could have saved Floyd's life. They must ALSO be held responsible for their inaction!""

Chauvin is not facing trial on these charges as he pled guilty to them in December, months after his conviction for murder and manslaughter.

Image: Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22.5 years

He was initially sentenced to 22.5 years and could now face more time behind bars as a result of this latest guilty plea.

What will the defence argue?

Rachel Paulose, a former US attorney for Minnesota, said it is ""highly likely that the remaining three officers are going to point the finger at Derek Chauvin and try to absolve themselves of any liability by claiming that he alone was responsible for the abuses against Mr Floyd that resulted in his murder.""

While harsh sentences are rarely brought in these federal civil rights cases, a guilty conviction could mean life imprisonment or the death penalty.

""At a minimum, it appears that these officers are facing 27 months in prison,"" according to Ms Paulose, ""but of course, it could go all the way up to life. A lot will ultimately depend on which officer is found guilty of what counts, as well as the need to balance their sentences against that of Mr Chauvin.""

How unusual are these charges?

These types of federal civil rights cases are rare.

According to data from Syracuse University, in 2019 these charges only represented a minute fraction of prosecutions brought - 27 out of every 100,000 prosecutions, or 0.027%.

The fact this case is even going to trial is indicative of progress, Ms Paulose says: ""I think 10 years ago, this crime might not have even been charged, but I think the public, the Justice Department and even officers themselves are acknowledging the limits of reasonable force.

""It should be possible to detain a non-violent person without killing that person. I think that's fundamental to our sense of justice, and I think that's one of the many reasons this case caused so much outrage in the United States and around the world.""

Terence Darrell Kelly has appeared in Carnarvon Magitstrates' Court where he pleaded guilty to a charge of child stealing.

He was arrested after detectives raided his home on 3 November and found the youngster locked inside a room, playing with dolls.

The toddler disappeared from her family's tent on a campsite in Western Australia in October last year.

Initially, a huge land and sea search got under way on the assumption she had wandered away from her tent.

Eighteen days later, police officers found Cleo ""alive and well"" inside a locked house in her hometown of Carnarvon.

At the time, her mum, Ellie Smith, wrote on social media: ""Our family is whole again.""

The partygate inquiry, which is being carried out by civil servant Sue Gray, could determine Mr Johnson's fate as the country's prime minister.

Many Tory MPs have said they will wait to see the investigation's findings before making a decision on whether to push for a vote of no confidence, which could see him forced out of Number 10.

However, some rebel MPs have indicated they will submit letters of no confidence to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, whatever the report finds.

Under party rules, once the total number of letters reaches 54 - 15% of Tory MPs - Sir Graham must call a vote of confidence in the leader.

Ms Gray's findings are not expected to be released on Monday but could come out any day this week.

Allies of Mr Johnson say there have been efforts to bolster his defences and protect his position ahead of the report's publication.

They believe there may still be a way through, providing Ms Gray does not explicitly state the prime minister was aware of any rule-breaking going on in Downing Street.

""There are still a few sharks in the water that we need to navigate... but the immediate danger has receded,"" one ally told Sky News.

The prime minister has spent the last two days at Chequers, his countryside retreat, calling MPs to try and shore up support.

Downing Street has already said he will come to the Commons after Ms Gray's report is published and take questions from members of parliament.

The report may also lead to renewed calls for the Metropolitan Police to open a criminal investigation if there is clear evidence that COVID restrictions were breached.

Among the events Ms Gray has been investigating is a ""bring your own booze"" do in the Downing Street garden in May 2020 during the first lockdown.

The PM has admitted he attended but said he thought it was a ""work event"" - an explanation that was met with widespread criticism.

Dominic Cummings - Mr Johnson's former top adviser - is set to be interviewed by Ms Gray today, according to reports.

An unnamed source told The Daily Telegraph that Met officers have also provided ""a lot of information"" to Ms Gray.

When asked when significant this material was, they added: ""Put it this way, if Boris Johnson is still prime minister by the end of the week, I'd be very surprised.""

Reorganisation and numerous sackings

Meanwhile, there are reports that a reorganisation may take place within Number 10, with the potential for numerous sackings among key staff, after the report has been published.

Cabinet ministers and senior Conservatives say that a culture change will be needed within Downing Street whatever happens.

Which lockdown parties is Sue Gray investigating, and what has Downing Street said?

Former defence secretary Liam Fox told Sky News: ""Clearly there have to be changes in Number 10, whether or not the prime minister is implicated in what happened during the lockdown.

""And it is clear that we need a better relationship between Number 10 and the Conservative Parliamentary Party, and the whips' office.

""It needs to be working much better than it has been doing.""

Calls for an inquiry into Islamophobia

Also this week, the prime minister is facing calls for an independent inquiry to be carried out into allegations made by former minister Nusrat Ghani that she was sacked from her ministerial position because of her Muslim faith.

Downing Street has said that an investigation will only be launched if Ms Ghani makes a formal complaint.

However, the President of Conservative Muslim Forum and Tory peer Lord Sheikh told Sky News an external inquiry was needed, saying the issue ""goes to the heart of the attitudes of some people in the party"".

Over the weekend two cabinet ministers - Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi - also backed calls for an inquiry.

Mr Zahawi said the claims needed to be ""investigated properly"" while Mr Javid said Nusrat Ghani ""must be heard"".

Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the offensive, saying they targeted al-Dhafra Air Base and other areas in the Emirati capital - along with sites in the Dubai region and the Saudi areas of Jizan and Asir.

Houthi military spokesman Yehia Sarei warned that the UAE would continue to be a target ""as long as attacks on the Yemeni people continue"".

This is the rebels' second assault on Abu Dhabi in a week following unprecedented drone strikes that killed three people last Monday.

The UAE is part of a Saudi-led coalition that has been at war with the Iran-backed Houthis for more than six years and was believed to be responsible for airstrikes that killed more than 80 people last week.

The Emirati defence ministry said the missiles were destroyed and there were no casualties.

Videos on social media appeared to show the sky light up before sunrise on Monday, with interceptor missiles moving through clouds to target the incoming fire.

Two explosions were later heard through the city and the missile fragments fell harmlessly to the ground, the state-run WAM news agency said.

The Emirati defence ministry tweeted out a black-and-white video that it said showed an F-16 striking the ballistic missile launcher used in the attack.

The site was identified as being near al-Jawaf, a Yemeni province around 1,400km southwest of Abu Dhabi.

On Sunday night, Saudi Arabia's state media said the country had intercepted a missile and the fragments fell and injured two foreign nationals, causing damage in an industrial area near a southern region.

The Emirati defence ministry said it is ""ready to deal with any threats"" and ""takes all necessary measures to protect the state from all attacks"".

At Al-Dhafra, which hosts both American and British forces, US personnel took shelter in bunkers during the attack, the US Air Force's Mideast command said.

Traffic was disrupted into Abu Dhabi International Airport for about an hour after the attack.

The US Embassy in Abu Dhabi later issued a security alert to Americans living in the UAE, telling citizens to ""maintain a high level of security awareness.""

Instructions were provided on how to cope with missile attacks, which is previously unheard of given the UAE's popularity as a safe tourist destination.

Crystal Symphony changed course after a federal judge in Florida issued an arrest warrant for the ship on Thursday as part of a lawsuit over $4.6m (£3.3m) in unpaid fuel.

The order would allow a US marshal to take charge of the vessel once it enters the country's waters.

Crystal Cruises or Star Cruises, which are responsible for the liner, are being sued by Peninsula Petroleum Far East for breach of contract due to unpaid debts.

As of Monday morning, the ship remains docked in the Bahamian island of Bimini.

Passengers and staff members posted on social media to say they were surprised to learn about the legal case.

One guest posted a letter on Facebook from Crystal Cruises Management that said the change in itinerary was made over ""non-technical operational issues"".

""We all feel we were abducted by luxurious pirates!"" passenger Stephen Heard Fales posted on Facebook.

Elio Pace, a musician who has toured off and on with the ship since 2013, said he thought: ""Are you actually kidding me? This is a joke, right?""

He was among the passengers who were taken by ferry to Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Sunday.

""It was two hours I never want to live through again,"" he said, adding: ""I have never, ever felt sick on a ship before.

""But you know those horror videos you find online when they show the ship ... going from side to side, and it almost looks like it's going to topple over? That's what it was like.""

A Crystal Cruises spokesperson said the ride was ""uncomfortable due to inclement weather"".

Guests were also taken to local airports, the company said, refusing to comment on the lawsuit.

The vessel can carry up to 848 passengers but the exact number of guests is not known, with reports suggesting 300 to 700 guests were on board.

Mr Pace estimates that between 30 and 50 crew members disembarked because their contracts came to an end.

He said other crew members do not know when they will get off the ship or if they will lose their jobs.

""This is a human story,"" he said. ""This is about people and their jobs, their dedication and their loyalty to a company. There are people on that ship that have been there for 15, 20, 25 years.""

Earlier this week, Crystal Cruises said it was suspending operations through late April.

It has two other ships at sea, which will end their voyages on 30 January in Aruba and 4 February in Argentina.

""Suspending operations will provide Crystal's management team with an opportunity to evaluate the current state of business and examine various options moving forward,"" the company said in a statement.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220124130522/https://news.sky.com/story/cruise-ship-diverts-to-the-bahamas-after-judge-allows-us-to-seize-vessel-over-4m-in-unpaid-fuel-12524190;

Dominic Cummings, the PM's former top aide, has told subscribers to his substack page that he will not speak to Sue Gray in person due to concerns his former boss will ""invent nonsense"" to discredit him.

Instead, he has given his account in writing to the civil servant investigating Downing Street parties.

And Mr Cummings warned there will be more damaging stories about the PM until the point he steps - or is forced to step - down.

The ex-aide writes: ""It's reported everywhere that I am seeing Sue Gray today. This is wrong. I am not seeing/talking to her. Why?

""Since leaving government I've tried to help with a few things, some directly and some very quietly.

""One such thing involved discussing the security services. Only me and two officials knew what I said. They briefed the PM. Within minutes, one of the lobby infamous for being a stooge was calling the Cabinet Office making claims about MI5 and me. The officials apologised and said, reasonably, the system doesn't work when a PM behaves like this.

""So when SG asked to speak to me I emailed to the effect: if we speak the PM will invent nonsense and spin it to the media and you and I will both have problems, let's keep everything in writing, therefore he cannot invent things I've supposedly said to you, there is only a written record, this makes both our lives easier. She agreed. So I have answered questions in writing and will answer further questions in writing if she wants. But I will not speak and therefore provide the PM with more chances to lie and confuse everybody.""

Mr Cummings also expressed concern about flaws in the investigation process - namely that Mr Johnson will see everything Ms Gray collected.

""This inevitably means that evidence, including photos, is not given to her and instead will keep leaking after her report. (To stress, this is a consequence of beliefs about the PM's integrity, not SG's.)""

Some have speculated as to whether Mr Cummings is party to more damaging claims about the prime minister.

And the former insider concluded his post ominously: ""Other damaging stories will come out until he is gone. It's clear talking to people in No10 and 70 Whitehall that many officials are desperate to shove the kunlangeta off the ice this week.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220124140142/http://news.sky.com/story/politics-latest-live-news-uk-boris-johnson-sue-gray-report-parties-nusrat-ghani-12514080;

It comes after the chief executives of the UK's largest airlines urged the government to end coronavirus-related travel restrictions.

The bosses pointed to evidence that the Omicron variant is in retreat, and argued that current measures have a ""limited effect"" in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

The latest coronavirus news from the UK and around the world

Speaking to broadcasters during a visit to the Academic Centre, Milton Keynes Hospital, the prime minister said: ""We have, thanks to the tough decisions, the big calls that we made... the most open economy and society in Europe.

""And although we have to be cautious, we are now moving through the Omicron wave, and you can see the figures are starting to get better.

""So what we're doing on travel, to show that this country is open for business, open for travellers, you will see changes so that people arriving no longer have to take tests if they have been vaccinated, if they have been double vaccinated.""

Johan Lundgren, easyJet's chief executive, said: ""We welcome this news knowing that millions of our customers will also be delighted to see the return of restriction-free travel in the UK. We now look ahead to what we believe will be a strong summer.

""We believe testing for travel should now firmly become a thing of the past. It is clear travel restrictions did not materially slow the spread of Omicron in the UK and so it is important that there are no more knee-jerk reactions to future variants.

""We commend the government for removing all testing. easyJet plans to return to near 2019 levels of flying this summer and so we can't wait to welcome our customers back onboard.""

From Thursday, COVID passports and the mandatory wearing of face masks are being scrapped in England - and people are no longer being told to work from home.

Speaking to Sky News, the World Health Organisation's special envoy for COVID, Dr David Nabarro, described the virus as ""very nasty and rather cunning"" - and said it should not be treated like the flu.

With Simon Coveney’s strong rebuke, Ireland has fired a verbal broadside at Russia - but Dublin knows it lacks the military muscle or legal grounds to do much else.

The Russian plans to undertake a major naval exercise in Irish-patrolled waters are seen as provocative, in the context of the Ukraine crisis. But under international law, they're not doing anything wrong.

It's understood the Russian exercise will take place approximately 150 miles (240km) off the County Cork coast.

This is outside Irish territorial waters, although inside the country's Exclusive Economic Zone, which extends for 200 nautical miles. Ireland has responsibility for this maritime area and patrols it with naval ships and airplanes.

Mr Coveney admits that Russia ""can of course undertake military exercises in international water, but the fact that they're choosing to do it on the western borders of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that in our view is simply not welcome and not wanted right now, particularly in the coming weeks.""

Ireland's foreign minister also conceded that ""we don't have the power to prevent this happening"", and that is true in several aspects.

The row is again exposing the bald fact that Ireland is Europe's weakest link when it comes to defence.

A neutral country and non-NATO member, with a defence spend that is among the very lowest anywhere in Europe, its ability to monitor foreign military activity offshore, let alone project a deterrent posture is extremely limited.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:26 Russia and the West: What's going on?

Just look at some of the numbers:

• The Irish Naval Service only has nine ships, and is in the middle of a staffing crisis. Crew numbers have dropped by 25% since 1998, and at times up to half the ships have been tied up due to staffing, COVID and mechanical issues. In November, it was reported that Ireland only had one ship ready to put to sea.

• The service does not possess any submarines or advanced underwater surveillance equipment.

• Ireland does not have any fighter jets. The Air Corps operates a total of eight Pilatus PC-9M aircraft. These are lightly-armed propeller-driven airplanes that are completely incapable of intercepting Russian military aircraft.

• Ireland effectively relies on Britain's RAF to carry out those missions. In March 2020, RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled twice to monitor Russian Tupolev ""Bear"" bombers that had entered Irish-controlled airspace off the western coast.

• Ireland is the only country in the EU that doesn't have a primary radar system. If planes switch off their transponders, which Russian jets routinely do, the Irish authorities simply cannot see them.

The Russians are of course fully aware of all of this. Military analysts in Ireland have repeatedly said that Moscow regards Ireland as the back door to Western Europe, in terms of air, naval and cyber security.

Ireland's strengths lie elsewhere. It consistently punches above its weight diplomatically, within the European Union, and currently with a seat on the UN Security Council. Mr Coveney is briefing his European counterparts on the Russian exercise in Brussels today, and will hope to extract a unified EU response.

But ultimately he knows his country's hands are tied. If the Russian bear wants to flex its claws in Ireland's backyard, that's exactly what will happen - and there's not much the Irish can do about it.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220124140142/http://news.sky.com/story/ireland-fires-broadside-at-russia-over-naval-drills-plan-off-coast-but-lacks-military-muscle-to-do-much-else-12524294;

Recently, the Office for National Statistics was sent an FOI request asking it to detail how many people who died in England and Wales had only COVID on their death certificate.



Some 17,371 people had only COVID on their death certificate, but in total there were 157,816 people who were counted as virus deaths (many of whom had pre-existing health conditions).

Although some COVID deniers have seized on this to claim the ""true"" number of virus deaths is lower, an expert has explained why this is ""nonsense"".

Colin Angus, a modeller at the University of Sheffield who looks at health inequalities, explained that death certificates list an ""underlying cause"" and can include several ""contributory causes"".

He shared a list of pre-existing conditions that can be included on the death certificate as a contributory cause, including diabetes, obesity and hypertension (high blood pressure).

""Something like a third of the population have high blood pressure (hypertension), ~5 million people in the UK have diabetes, just under a third are obese etc. etc,"" he wrote on Twitter.

He continued: ""Once you get past your mid-50s, chances are you have a long-term health condition. By the time you reach your 70s, you have to be extremely lucky not to.

""So that is a *lot* of people with pre-existing conditions. If any of them were unlucky enough to have caught COVID, get severely ill and die, all it takes is for these conditions to have *some* impact for it to end up as a contributory cause on the death certificate.""

He pointed to further research showing the ""vast majority"" of people admitted to critical care with COVID did not need any support prior to admission, saying: ""These are not people who were already at death's door.""

Mr Angus added: ""Not counting deaths with pre-existing conditions is saying to people with these conditions that their lives don't matter.

""The argument being made is that only the lives of people with no pre-existing health conditions count.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220124140142/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-news-latest-live-updates-plan-b-coronavirus-restrictions-ending-omicron-12507015;

A Cabinet Office investigation has been ordered by the prime minister after Nusrat Ghani, who was sacked as transport minister in a February 2020 reshuffle, made her claim at the weekend.

It is disappointing that when this issue was raised before Ms Ghani declined to refer the matter to the Conservative Party for a formal investigation.

Ms Ghani said she was told by a whip, who she did not identify, that her ""Muslimness was raised as an issue"" at a meeting in Downing Street.

She said she was also told that her ""Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable"" and that there were concerns ""that I wasn't loyal to the party as I didn't do enough to defend the party against Islamophobia allegations"".

Asked about the allegation on Monday, Mr Johnson said: ""We take these allegations extremely seriously, I took them very seriously when they were raised with me 18 months ago... very glad there's an investigation taking place now.

""I can't say more, really, about it.""

In the immediate aftermath of Ms Ghani's comments, chief whip Mark Spencer said he was the whip in question.

He described her allegations as ""completely false"", adding: ""I consider them to be defamatory. I have never used those words attributed to me.""

Asked if Mr Spencer could stay in his role while the inquiry is carried out, the PM said: ""This is something I take personally extremely seriously, I took it very seriously 18 months ago, we must wait and see what the investigation produces.""

Johnson attempts to shift focus away from thorny issues around his premiership Rob Powell Political correspondent @robpowellnews Speaking at a hospital in Milton Keynes the prime minister was desperate not to create any fresh waves on issues around the allegations of Islamophobia made by Nusrat Ghani and the eagerly awaited Sue Gray report into Downing Street gatherings. He had a way out on both issues, saying he couldn't comment until two Cabinet Office inquiries had come back. On other issues though, there was news. Despite repeated questioning, Boris Johnson refused to explicitly commit to the planned rise in National Insurance, saying instead that the money was needed for the NHS. On COVID, he announced the dropping of testing requirements for international travel. And asked about events in Ukraine, he picked particularly alarming language, warning the country could become the ""new Chechnya"" amid ""gloomy"" intelligence on the possibility of a Russian invasion. On a political level, this is a clear attempt to shift attention away from thorniest issues currently dogging his premiership. But it's also a reminder that for all the scandal washing around Westminster, there are plenty of other huge domestic and international issues bubbling away.

Ms Ghani has also claimed that when she raised the matter directly with the PM, he told her he could not get involved.

Number 10 says PM told MP to make formal complaint

""At the time these allegations were first made, the prime minister recommended to her that she make a formal complaint to CCHQ. She did not take up this offer,"" a Number 10 spokesperson said.

""The prime minister has now asked officials to establish the facts about what happened.

""As he said at the time, the prime minister takes these claims very seriously.""

Responding to the launch of an investigation, Ms Ghani said she welcomed the news.

The requirement, which is central to the government's anti-virus strategy, means people who are not vaccinated will not be allowed in these public spaces.

France has been experiencing Europe's highest-ever daily case numbers for coronavirus infections, and its hospitals are continuing to fill up with COVID patients.

Image: A protest against the vaccine passes was held in Paris on Saturday

The government has imposed few other restrictions amid the surge in the Omicron variant, focusing instead on the vaccine pass, approved by France's parliament and Constitutional Council last week.

Omicron is less likely to cause severe illness than the previous Delta variant, according to studies.

It spreads even more easily than other coronavirus strains and has already become dominant in many countries, including the UK.

Omicron also more easily infects those who have been vaccinated or had previously been infected by prior versions of the virus.

Critics question whether the pass will make much difference in a country where 94% of French adults have had at least one vaccine dose, and scattered groups held protests on Saturday against the new law.

The government hopes that it protects the most vulnerable and reduces pressure on crowded ICUs, where most patients are unvaccinated.

Since last summer, France has required a ""health pass"" to go to any cafe, museum, cinema or take a regional train or domestic flight.

But until Monday, unvaccinated people could activate the pass by getting a recent negative test.

The new pass only works for people who are fully vaccinated, and those who recently recovered from the virus.

The Chinese tennis player disappeared from public view for nearly three weeks in November 2021 when she appeared to accuse a former Chinese vice premier, Zhang Gaoli, of sexually assaulting her in the past.

Last month she denied ever accusing anyone of sexual assault and said a social media post she had written had been misunderstood.

There remain concerns about her well-being and the World Tennis Association has suspended tournaments in China.

After video emerged of security officials and police telling fans to remove shirts with the slogan ""Where is Peng Shuai?"" at the Australian Open on Saturday, Tennis Australia (TA) defended its stance by saying the tournament doesn't allow political statements.

Australia's tennis governing body said in a statement: ""Under our ticket conditions of entry we don't allow clothing, banners or signs that are commercial or political.""

Navratilova, an 18-time Grand Slam winner, accused Tennis Australia of ""capitulating"" to China and putting sponsorship money ahead of human rights concerns.

She told the US-based Tennis Channel: ""I find it really, really cowardly.

""I think they are wrong on this. This is not a political statement, this is a human rights statement.

""(Tennis Australia is) just really capitulating on this issue... letting the Chinese really dictate what they do at their own slam. I just find it really weak.""

On Monday, Peng supporters in Australia said they were planning to hand out 1,000 ""Where is Peng Shuai?"" T-shirts at Melbourne Park this week after raising more than $10,000 (£5,287) on a GoFundMe page.

Declan Haughney told the Irish Mirror he and another man took Peadar Doyle, 66, on a five-minute walk from his home on Pollerton Road, Carlow, to collect his pension last Friday morning.

The 40-year-old said he had lived with his uncle throughout his life and believes he may have died on the way to Hosey's post office on Staplestown Road.

He said he and another man linked arms with him and dragged him to the post office.

""He was walking like normal and then I reckon he died,"" he said, adding that Mr Doyle started ""dragging his heels"" at one point.

""We were grand like then all of a sudden he started going all slumpy,"" he said.

""We thought nothing of it because Peadar had had heart attacks and all.""

He said they let him go at the post office counter and it was only after he dropped to the floor that they realised he had died.

Mr Haughney said he believes he is being falsely accused of trying to claim his uncle's pension because he previously stole from his aunt and served two years in prison.

He said: ""Why would I want to rob my uncle?

""I'm 40 years of age yeah, I'm not a child, I'm not a young fella.

""I'm not an eejit to walk into Hoseys with a dead man and collect his money.

""Am I cuckoo? Am I cuckoo? I'm not.""

Irish police also believe Mr Doyle died before his body reached the post office at 11am, according to the Irish Times.

Foul play has reportedly been ruled out but a post-mortem was only able to estimate the time of death as some time on Friday morning.

Police have not yet determined whether the retired painter was already dead when taken from the house.

Earlier this week it was reported that Mr Doyle had been carried up to the post office counter by two men who were propping him up.

When the group approached, a ""concerned staff member enquired about the wellbeing of the man"", the Irish Times said.

At that point, the two others ""dropped the man and left the post office"", the paper added.

Staff then apparently attended to the man and found he had died.

According to RTE, a man initially called into the post office to collect a pension on behalf of an elderly man.

He was apparently told, however, that the recipient had to be present, and two men arrived a short time later with the deceased.

No money was handed over, the Irish Independent said.

Mr Haughney has not been arrested.

ITV News understands the prime minister's wife, Carrie Johnson, helped to arrange the event which was held just after 2pm the afternoon of 19 June 2020 - Mr Johnson's birthday.

Up to 30 people are thought to have attended the event which the broadcaster says was held in the Cabinet Room after the PM returned from a school visit in Hertfordshire that morning.

In the evening, family friends were reportedly hosted upstairs in the prime minister's official residence in a further breach of the rules, ITV has reported.

At the afternoon event, the PM's wife Johnson and Lulu Lytle - an interior designer who at the time was renovating Mr Johnson's flat in Downing Street - are believed to have presented the prime minister with a cake whilst his wife led staff in a chorus of happy birthday.

Meanwhile, those present are understood to have eaten picnic food from Marks & Spencer at the gathering which is said to have lasted for around 20-30 minutes.

At the time of the party, social gatherings indoors were still forbidden under the government's own coronavirus rules.

However a No 10 denied the claim to ITV, saying: ""This is totally untrue. In line with the rules at the time the Prime Minister hosted a small number of family members outside that evening.""

People were only permitted to meet outside in groups of up to six people and pubs, hairdressers and restaurants remained closed.

A No 10 spokeswoman said: ""A group of staff working in No 10 that day gathered briefly in the Cabinet Room after a meeting to wish the prime minister a happy birthday. He was there for less than 10 minutes.""

In response to ITV's claims that an alleged event took place later on the evening of the 19 June in the prime minister's flat, the spokeswoman said: ""This is totally untrue.

The alliance said it could also add additional combat units in response to Russia's military build-up on Ukraine's border.

NATO has so far based about 4,000 troops in multinational battalions in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, backed by tanks, air defences and intelligence and surveillance units.

Russia has massed around 100,000 troops near Ukraine's border, demanding that NATO promise it will never allow Ukraine to join and that other actions, such as stationing alliance troops in former Soviet bloc countries, be curtailed. Moscow denies it is planning an invasion.

Mr Johnson said: ""The intelligence is very clear that there are 60 Russian battle groups on the borders of Ukraine, the plan for a lightning war that could take out Kyiv is one that everybody can see.

""We need to make it very clear to the Kremlin, to Russia, that that would be a disastrous step.""

""From a Russian perspective"" an invasion is ""going to be a painful, violent and bloody business"", the prime minister went on.

""I think it's very important that people in Russia understand that this could be a new Chechnya.""

The PM said he had visited Ukraine and knew the people of the country, adding: ""My judgement is that they will fight.""

Spain is sending ships to join NATO naval forces, France has expressed its readiness to send troops to Romania under NATO command, and the Netherlands is sending two F-35 fighter aircraft to Bulgaria from April to support NATO's air-policing activities in the region.

The United States has said it is considering increasing its military presence in eastern Europe.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance is ""hoping for the best"" but added it has to be ""prepared for the worst"". He insisted NATO was not threatening Russia and urged Moscow to continue dialogue.

He said: ""I welcome allies contributing additional forces to NATO. NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the alliance.

""We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence.""

It comes as Ireland's foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said planned Russian naval exercises in the international waters off Ireland are ""not welcome"".

Russia said late last week its navy would stage a sweeping set of exercises involving all its fleets from the Pacific to the Atlantic.

It would be the latest show of strength in a surge of military activity during a standoff with the West.

Mr Coveney said on Monday: ""We don't have a power to prevent this happening but certainly I have made it clear to the Russian ambassador in Ireland that this is not welcome. This isn't a time to increase military activity and tension.""

US officials also stressed the Kyiv embassy will remain open and that the announcement does not constitute an evacuation.

The decision had been under consideration for some time and does not reflect an easing of US support for Ukraine, the officials added.

Ukraine's foreign affairs spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko has said the US decision was ""premature"" and one of ""excessive caution"".

Here Sky News speaks to scientists about what challenges lie between the UK removing COVID measures and the global pandemic being declared officially over.

Approaching end of Omicron - but not COVID

At the start of January, the number of Omicron cases in the UK peaked at nearly 200,000 a day but have been falling considerably since then.

Although such high levels of infection in December and good uptake of booster jabs mean most of the population have a higher level of immunity against Omicron, new variants are still likely to emerge.

Professor Andrew Preston, of the University of Bath's biology and biochemistry department, told Sky News that seemingly the main factor driving the government's decisions on COVID is the ""long-term trajectory of the variant we have at the moment"".

But he warns: ""We have seen that COVID can significantly change its behaviour - first with the Alpha variant, then Delta and now with Omicron.

""We're approaching a point in the UK where Omicron is in a steady state.

""But there's nothing to say that there won't be another variant in the future that will be more virulent.""

Professor Lawrence Young, an expert in molecular oncology at the University of Warwick, also stressed the ""big ongoing threat of new variants"".

He said: ""The longer the virus is allowed to spread in populations that aren't completely vaccinated, the more likely it is to mutate.

""We avoid that endless cycle of new variants by helping the global effort on vaccination, but also maintaining surveillance (testing) capacity.""

No guarantee next variant will be milder

With some other viruses there is evidence that in order to survive, new variants must become less severe.

Professor Preston explains that viruses like COVID which only live in humans are ""dependent on having live humans around"".

Therefore, if the virus is so severe that it ""kills its hosts at high frequency… the number of available hosts will start to dwindle and if this continues it will die out"".

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:47 Omicron 'hard to outcompete' for future variants

He explains: ""In this case, a variant that is able to transmit to a new host without killing it will be fitter - as it will maintain the supply of hosts and therefore its niche on the planet.""

This means that future COVID variants may continue to be milder, like Omicron.

But he warns: ""This isn't necessarily a given, and the opposite can be true.""

Professor Young gives the examples of measles, malaria and Ebola, none of which have become ""any easier to deal with"" over time.

""They are no less aggressive or pathogenic than they were - they're still very dangerous diseases.""

Waning vaccine immunity

The latest UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data suggests that vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation from Omicron reduces to only 52% after six months with only two doses.

But with a third jab that increases again to 88%.

However, with the NHS still under huge pressures from Omicron staff absences and backlogs from two years of COVID delays, it is unlikely to be able vaccinate people at such a frequent rate.

""Waning immunity of our current vaccine is another concerning thing,"" Professor Young says.

Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

""The whole population can't be vaccinated every six months or a year.""

He adds that reduced vaccine efficacy is particularly an issue in schools, where millions of five to 11-year-olds are unvaccinated and able to spread the virus easily.

""We could end up in an endless cycle of children infecting adults with waning immunity,"" he says.

""The hope is that with current vaccines and the high levels of Omicron we've seen people are double-protected.""

Scientists are also working on improved vaccines with built-in protection against new variants, he adds.

Removing testing and self-isolation will leave us 'blind'

In response to reports lateral flow tests will soon no longer be free and widely available, the government has said they will be for ""as long as necessary"".

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that he wants to remove the legal requirement to self-isolate if you have COVID by 24 March - if not earlier.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:15 Is govt ready to end isolation against WHO guidance?

Professor Preston suggests that delaying this until the Easter school holidays - or when the weather has improved so there is less indoor mixing - would be better.

And on testing, Professor Young warns: ""Removing testing will mean you don't know where the virus is and how it's spreading.

""Then you are completely blind to outbreaks, and particularly with those who are higher-risk, not having targeted testing is very worrying.""

Modellers at the University of Warwick have also predicted an 'exit wave' of between 1,000 and 2,000 Omicron cases a day at some point this summer once restrictions lift.

Professor Young adds: ""It's going to be very likely that we see a rebound of Omicron.

""It's very, very infectious, so it's hard to see how we wouldn't get huge levels of infection again.""

The emergence of the BA.2 sub-lineage of Omicron as a 'variant under investigation' also ""reiterates the importance of testing to monitor the arrival of new variants"", he adds.

Clinically vulnerable paying price for return to normalcy

Over the course of the pandemic, some scientists and politicians have caused controversy by putting their weight behind the concept of so-called 'herd immunity'.

This is when so much of the population has developed immunity to the virus by being infected that there are not enough left for it to keep reproducing - causing it to eventually peter out.

But although the UK has seen such high levels of Omicron cases over the past two months - recent ONS data suggests Omicron is 16 times more likely to reinfect people who have already had it than Delta was.

This means, Professor Preston says, that the ""traditional concept of herd immunity doesn't apply"" with Omicron.

He also stresses that herd immunity strategies do not protect the clinically vulnerable - as they cannot risk becoming infected.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:56 COVID fears for the immunocompromised

""We need to be empathetic and recognise that while for most of us, there's no more we can do to avoid COVID, for some people the anxiety and risk of getting it is much, much higher.

""It will be them paying the price for our return to normalcy.""

He adds that the NHS may be able to facilitate annual boosters for the immunocompromised ""for a few years"" - but they would not offer ""100% protection"".

""We don't know how long that protection would last for the super-vulnerable,"" he says.

Globally end of pandemic could take 'a few years'

WHO has repeatedly said that the pandemic will continue as long as the significant parts of the planet are unvaccinated.

Professor Young adds that we need to ""learn from past experiences"" and that despite the government promising last July would be the removal of the last set of restrictions - they had to be reimposed just months later.

""Where we have a raging pandemic elsewhere, we can never say we're completely out of it - we're not a moated castle,"" he says.

Professor Preston says that ""over the next few years"" different countries will experience COVID at differing levels.

""If Omicron does spread worldwide, then we will reach a point where everyone has had it and there are a steady number of cases through reinfections,"" he says.

""But it might take quite a few years to reach that state.""

He adds that while WHO could decide to declare the pandemic over if most countries opt for ""living with COVID"" strategies as the UK has - the virus will still be there.

""It'd be about getting it out of our national psyches - and the focus no longer being on it - but that wouldn't mean there would be no COVID anymore.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220124190310/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-as-uk-restrictions-lift-what-challenges-do-we-face-before-the-end-of-the-pandemic-and-when-could-that-be-12524215;

The liquid was supposedly spotted beneath the planet's ice-covered south pole in 2018.

Scientists saw bright reflections and assumed they were looking at water under the polar cap.

Image: NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars in August 2021. Pic: NASA/JPL-Caltech.

But, new research by the University of Texas says the temperature and pressure on the planet make it unlikely that water could exist there.

Cyril Grima, a planetary scientist at the university's Institute for Geophysics said: ""For water to be sustained this close to the surface, you need both a very salty environment and a strong, locally generated heat source, but that doesn't match what we know of this region.""

The scientists suggest the sighting could have been volcanic rock buried under ice, and not water after all.

The researchers tested their theory by seeing how the planet would appear if was looked at through a mile of ice.

This allowed them to compare features across the entire planet with those under the polar cap.

Mr Grima noticed the same bright reflections like those seen in 2018, but they were scattered across the planet, matching the location of volcanic plains.

Lava flows, rich in iron, can leave behind rocks with similar reflections, which can be mistaken for water.

While this may seem like disappointing news, plenty of ice can be found on Mars, and many scientists are excited about further developments in our understanding of the planet.

Geophysicist at York University Isaac Smith said the ""beauty"" of the findings is that ""it gives us really precise places to go look for evidence of ancient lakes and riverbeds and test hypotheses about the wider drying out of Mars's climate over billions of years.""

Mr Smith believes the bright reflections are due to a type of clay made when rock erodes in water.

The study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, is based on three years of data from Marsis, a radar instrument aboard the European Space Agency's Mars Express.

Images of the planet from a NASA rover last year confirmed there was once a lake on the surface which was fed by a small river about 3.7 billion years ago.

Police officers on patrol in the historic district of the capital San Juan heard a loud bang at 4.30am local time and found the statue broken in pieces, city police commissioner Colonel Jose Juan Garcia said.

The toppling of the memorial, made of melted steel from British cannons, ""sounded like an explosion"" he said.

The incident occurred just hours before Spain's King Felipe VI was due to meet Puerto Rico governor Pedro Pierluisi and other officials to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the founding of San Juan.

Two years ago, activists marched through the streets of Old San Juan in support of a US movement to eradicate symbols of oppression and demanded that Spain's legacy in Puerto Rico be erased.

While some statues have been defaced with graffiti, police said this is the first time such a statue had been knocked over.

The statue was located in the Plaza San Jose, near the second oldest surviving Spanish church in the Americas.

Its construction began in 1532 on land donated by Ponce de Leon and its base was erected on an Indigenous settlement.

Making a statement on the coronavirus rule change in the Commons, the transport secretary said those who have had two doses of an approved vaccination or one dose of a Janssen/J+J vaccine will no longer need to take a pre-departure or post-arrival test.

The change will be introduced in time for the half-term break.

Travel testing rule change

Mr Shapps told MPs 2022 will be ""the year in which restrictions on travel, on lockdowns and limits on people's lives are firmly placed in the past"".

He said: ""It means that after months of pre-departure testing, post-arrival testing, self-isolation, additional expense, all that fully vaccinated people will now have to do, when they travel to the UK, is to verify their status via a passenger locator form.""

The latest coronavirus news from the UK and around the world

Those who are not fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day eight test after arriving in the UK and will not have to isolate, the transport secretary also confirmed.

The move comes after chief executives of the UK's largest airlines urged the government to end coronavirus-related travel restrictions due to the impact they were having on the travel industry.

The bosses pointed to evidence that the Omicron variant is in retreat, and argued that current measures have a ""limited effect"" in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Conservative chairman of the Commons Transport Select Committee, Huw Merriman, said it is a ""landmark day for international travel"".

Image: The airline industry has welcomed the news

Shapps: Move will make travel 'easier'

Announcing the changes in the Commons, Mr Shapps told MPs: ""We promised we wouldn't keep these measures in place a day longer than was necessary and it's obvious to me now that border testing for vaccinated travellers has outlived its usefulness, and we're therefore scrapping all travel tests for vaccinated people.

""Not only making travel much easier but also, of course, saving about £100 per family on visits abroad, providing certainty to passengers, to carriers and (the) vital tourism sector for the spring and the summer seasons.""

Mr Shapps told MPs the current definition of fully vaccination for the purposes of inbound travel to the UK - two doses of an approved vaccination or one dose of a Janssen vaccine - will remain in place ""for now""

He also confirmed that 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel.

In addition, Mr Shapps told MPs the UK is also set to recognise vaccine certificates from 16 further nations.

""That will include countries like China and Mexico, bringing the vaccine recognition total to over 180 countries and territories worldwide,"" the transport secretary said.

He added that reconnecting to key markets will not only ""boost"" the UK economy but also help the aviation industry to ""take back to the skies"".

Mr Shapps said the government intends to move away from ""blanket border measures"" to a ""more sophisticated and targeted global surveillance system"" and that a ""strategy"" to do so will be set out ""next month"".

Travel industry welcomes news

easyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren welcomed the news, adding: ""We believe testing for travel should now firmly become a thing of the past.""

He continued: ""It is clear travel restrictions did not materially slow the spread of Omicron in the UK and so it is important that there are no more knee-jerk reactions to future variants.""

Christophe Mathieu, chief executive of Brittany Ferries, added: ""As the barriers to travel come down, demand goes up.

""Reservations for spring and summer holidays are roaring ahead, but this latest news means we can expect demand to soar for the February half-term. Let us hope we can put the last of the lockdown obstacles behind us and make 2022 a comeback year to remember.""

And Tim Alderslade, chief executive of airline industry body Airlines UK, said the announcement was ""a landmark day for passengers, businesses and UK plc"".

Earlier, the prime minister said the rules could be lifted because the country was ""moving through the Omicron wave"".

""So what we're doing on travel, to show that this country is open for business, open for travellers, you will see changes so that people arriving no longer have to take tests if they have been vaccinated, if they have been double vaccinated,"" he told reporters.

A 41-year-old man was hit by a car on Chippenham Road in Maida Vale, west London, at about 9am on Monday, police said.

One witness said he was attacking a woman and the confrontation moved into the road, where they were both hit by a car.

Witnesses tried to intervene to save the 43-year-old woman but she was fatally injured by the attacker, police said.

According to detectives, the woman knew her attacker, who also died at the scene.

The Met Police said the driver of the car had been arrested but it was not aware of any links between him and the two people who died.

The force said it is not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

Firefighters managed to free the man from underneath the car, but despite the efforts of paramedics, both people were declared dead at the scene.

Witness Mulugeta Asseratte told PA news agency: ""It is a very terrible incident. I was coming up from the bakery to Chippenham Road and suddenly heard shouts of 'stop it, stop it' and it was a girl being attacked by a gentleman.

1621;1621;Russia-Ukraine tensions: How the Nord Stream 2 pipeline has been controversial from the start;Monday 24 January 2022 17:43, UK;[];['europe', 'germany', 'russia', 'ukraine'];['gas', 'supplies', 'nord', 'start', 'tensions', 'russia', 'russian', 'project', 'pipeline', 'controversial', 'ukraine', 'russiaukraine', 'stream', 'germany'];"Nord Stream 2 is a new gas pipeline which runs from Russia to Europe - but concerns about energy supplies are escalating amid Russian tensions with Ukraine.

We take a look at the pipeline, its role in the current tensions and how it continues to be a controversial project.

What is Nord Stream 2?

The export pipeline runs through the Baltic Sea, beginning near Narva Bay in the Ust-Luga area of the Kingisepp district in Russia's Leningrad region.

It makes landfall at Lubmin, a German town on the northern coast near Greifswald.

Advertisement

The $11bn (£8bn) project will contribute to the demand for gas in Europe, where imports are expected to grow.

The pipeline has been built but has not yet secured regulatory approval to allow it to go into operation.

Germany's energy regulator is not expected to make a decision on certifying the pipeline until the second half of 2022 at the earliest.

Along with the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which opened in 2012, the project will increase Russia's annual export capacity to 110 billion cubic metres - about half of what it sells to Europe every year.

The operator, Gazprom, is a state-controlled energy company with its headquarters in St Petersburg and says it sells more than half of its gas to Russian consumers and exports to more than 30 countries.

Why is the project controversial?

American officials had opposed the project, which allows Russia to directly export gas to Germany and potentially cut off other nations.

There are concerns it would give Russia too much power over European gas supplies - and there has been particularly strong opposition to the project in the US, Ukraine and Poland.

Taking its route through the Baltic Sea, it bypasses Ukraine which has traditionally been the main route for Russian gas.

More than a third of Europe's gas requirements are already provided by Gazprom.

The US and Germany have committed to impose costs on Russia to prevent it from using the pipeline as a political weapon.

In 2019, a major contractor stopped working on the project after the US imposed sanctions on the firms involved.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said she is very concerned about Europe's dependence on Russian gas.

She has also said Nord Stream 2 should not go ahead if Russia attacks Ukraine.

Image: The facility in Lubmin, Germany, where the Nord Stream 2 pipeline makes landfall

What has been happening amid the escalating tension between Russia and Ukraine?

Concerns are rising in the European gas market about Russian supplies in the worst-case scenario of an attack that disrupts flows.

US President Joe Biden and other Western leaders have threatened economic sanctions on Russia if it attacks Ukraine.

Europe has already been dealing with lower-than-usual Russian gas flows for several months.

How is it different to other Russian gas export projects involving Europe?

Apart from the Nord Stream projects, there are two other lines which carry gas from Russia into the European market.

The Brotherhood pipeline goes through Ukraine.

The Yamal-Europe pipeline passes through Belarus and Poland.

What could go wrong?

Chancellor Olaf Scholz has indicated that Germany would be ready to discuss suspending the Nord Stream 2 project if Moscow attacked Ukraine.

Russia has said that both Europe and Russia will gain from Nord Stream 2 and that Germany should not ""politicise"" the project.

There are other gas options for some countries. For example, Germany, the biggest consumer of Russian gas, can also import from Norway, the Netherlands, Britain and Denmark via pipelines.

What's going on at the Russia-Ukraine border?

But Norway, the second largest supplier to Europe, is delivering natural gas to Europe at maximum capacity and that can't replace any missing supplies from Russia, its prime minister has said.

There have been several disputes between Russia and Ukraine in the past 15 years over gas, mostly to do with the price Ukraine paid for the fuel under contracts.

In 2006, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine for one day. In the winter of 2008-9, Russian supply to Ukraine was disrupted due to disagreements over outstanding debts and prices, a situation that rippled across Europe.

In 2014, Russia cut off supplies to Kyiv amid the Russian annexation of Crimea.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220124190754/http://news.sky.com/story/russia-ukraine-tensions-how-the-nord-stream-2-pipeline-has-been-controversial-from-the-start-12524379;

The prime minister's official spokesperson told reporters Mr Johnson believes the proposal is the ""right approach"" to ""tackling the massive backlog"" facing the NHS and to ""address the long-standing problem of fixing our social care system"".

Asked whether reports that members of Mr Johnson's cabinet will back a move to delay the rise are accurate, the PM's spokesperson added: ""Cabinet took a collective decision to take this action, to put money into our NHS, to tackle the backlogs, to resolve the long-standing problem of social care and to fund a pay rise for nurses. The cabinet stands behind that decision.""

Image: The NI hike will come as households struggle with the impact of the lifting of the energy price cap

It comes as members of the PM's own party, including former cabinet minister David Davis, have called for the hike to be scrapped amid the ongoing cost of living crisis.

Last week, Mr Davis argued the move would be ""economically unwise"" as it would create a ""disincentive to work"", telling the BBC that the proposed rise would remove about 10% of the disposable income of ""ordinary families"".

In September, the PM announced that National Insurance contributions will rise by 1.25% to pay for the social care system in England in a bid to end the ""unpredictable and catastrophic costs"" faced by many.

A social care package, which the prime minister has called ""the biggest catch-up programme"" in the NHS's history, will be funded through a new, UK-wide 1.25% health and social care levy' from April 2022.

The decision to put up contributions broke the Conservative Party's 2019 election manifesto pledge.

The 1.25 percentage point increase is predicted to raise about £36bn which, in the early years, will mainly be used to fund dealing with the NHS backlog.

The PM's plan to overhaul the social care sector includes:

• A government pledge to invest £36 billion over the next three years to help the NHS recover from the pandemic.

• To also invest in reforming the social care sector.

• A promise that from October 2023, nobody will pay more than £86,000 for their social care - regardless of their assets.

• That the government will fully cover the cost of care for those with assets under £20,000, and contribute to the cost of care for those with assets of between £20,000 and £100,000.

The plan was signed off by ministers at a cabinet meeting four months ago, but now it is understood that some ministers are calling for it to be halted as household bills continue to soar.

Image: Senior Conservative David Davis has called for the move to be scrapped

Official figures published last week showed that inflation soared to a near 30-year high of 5.4% in December, while an energy price cap rise in spring is set to stretch household budgets further.

Brexit minister Lord Frost quit his role at the tail end of last year in protest at government tax increases.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said the ""terrible strain"" the coronavirus pandemic has put on the health service means the National Insurance hike is essential, but did not explicitly say the rise would take place in April.

""The NHS has done an amazing job but it has been under terrible strain,"" the PM said.

""Listen to what I'm saying: We've got to put that money in. We've got to make that investment in our NHS.

""What I'm telling people is, if you want to fund our fantastic NHS, we have to pay for it - and this government is determined to do so.""

Pushed on whether the proposal should be halted amid rising cost of living pressures, the prime minister vowed to tackle the crisis by helping ""getting people into work"".

""What we've got to do is look at all the ways we can address cost of living for people, so it is the cost of fuel, it is making sure that we deal with inflation by getting people into work, dealing with problems in the supply chain, getting people off welfare and into work, helping get our economy moving smoothly again,"" he told reporters.

Labour has regularly voiced its opposition to the national insurance increase, with leader Sir Keir Starmer pledging to take a different approach if elected to Downing Street.

Meanwhile, when the original proposal was announced in September, the leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey - who himself is a carer - described the new health and social care levy as an ""unfair tax"".

The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford referred to the move as ""the prime minister's poll tax on Scottish workers to pay for English social care"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220124190754/http://news.sky.com/story/number-10-boris-johnson-committed-to-national-insurance-tax-hike-in-april-despite-pressure-to-scrap-the-move-amid-cost-of-living-crisis-12524409;

But Myeloma UK has told Sky News it has heard from patients who have not received an NHS letter - while others have been denied the drug treatment because their symptoms were ""too mild"".

It comes after Phil Edwards, a patient in Corby near Kettering, ended up in hospital for several days after his condition worsened, prompting his ""shocked"" GP to raise it as a major incident and his family to call on the government to do more.

Jo Nove, acting chief executive at Myeloma UK, said: ""We are seriously concerned that clinically extremely vulnerable patients are being forgotten in this pandemic.

""It is hard to gauge the extent of the issue and we are worried that many patients have been missed off eligibility lists and therefore don't even know they're entitled to the drugs.

""The government has said that we must learn to live with COVID-19 and consider what adaptations to pre-pandemic life we might need for society to open up again and get back to normal.

""Clinically extremely vulnerable patients need assurances that they will be able to access antivirals and treatments, without needless red tape, before they feel ready to think about a return to normality.

""We are rushing into an uncertain future, in which immunocompromised patients are being asked to make difficult choices and assess their own risk without a clear framework of protections in place.""

Mr Edwards, 60, who was diagnosed with myeloma last August, was discharged from hospital after three days - but his family told of their anger over how the antiviral drugs were not made available.

But Mr Sharma said: ""Even if you were extracting more right now from the North Sea Basin, ultimately the price that's going to be generated is going to be the international wholesale gas price.

One of the critical elements of the Glasgow Climate Pact was the agreement that all countries made to increase their climate commitments (known as NDCs) by the end of 2022.

However, Mr Sharma suggested that the United Kingdom may not have to do so.

Cummings claims evidence is being kept from inquiry by fearful staff

Mr Cummings, who left Downing Street in November 2020 and has since been a fierce critic of Mr Johnson, made his latest comments on his Substack blog.

He said he told Ms Gray that he would only give evidence in writing because ""if we speak the PM will invent nonsense and spin it to the media and you and I will both have problems"".

Mr Cummings said he told Ms Gray ""let's keep everything in writing"" as ""therefore he [the PM] cannot invent things I've supposedly said to you, there is only a written record, this makes both our lives easier. She agreed.""

He continued: ""So I have answered questions in writing and will answer further questions in writing if she wants.

""But I will not speak and therefore provide the PM with more chances to lie and confuse everybody.""

'Other damaging stories will come out'

Mr Cummings also claimed that evidence was being kept from the Cabinet Office inquiry because staff are worried it would be seen by the PM.

He suggested this means that more evidence, including pictures, will keep emerging once the report is released.

""I know others are very worried about handing things to the Cabinet Office because they know the PM will see everything SG collects,"" Mr Cummings said.

""This inevitably means that evidence, including photos, is not given to her and instead will keep leaking after her report. (To stress, this is a consequence of beliefs about the PM's integrity, not SG's.)

""Other damaging stories will come out until he is gone.""

""Many officials are desperate"" to see Mr Johnson gone this week, Mr Cummings suggested, as he promised to carry out an ""ask me anything"" session on his blog once the report is released.

Report police have provided 'a lot of information' to investigation

Speaking during a visit to a hospital on Monday, Mr Johnson said people would have to ""wait"" for the Cabinet Office report to come out.

Mr Cummings latest comments come as an unnamed source told The Daily Telegraph that Metropolitan Police officers have provided ""a lot of information"" to Ms Gray.

When asked how significant this material is, they added: ""Put it this way, if Boris Johnson is still prime minister by the end of the week, I'd be very surprised.""

Mr Johnson has said he will make the findings of the Cabinet Office investigation public and also make a statement to MPs.

It could be up to PM what is made public

Speaking on Monday, the PM's spokesman suggested it could be up to Mr Johnson what exactly is released into the public domain.

He said: ""It's very much our intention to publish the findings in full as set out in the terms of reference.""

But asked if Ms Gray could request that the report be published in its entirety - even if the PM disagreed - the spokesman said: ""I think it is a report that comes to the prime minister.""

If it is critical of the PM, it will increase the pressure on him and could spark a vote of no confidence in his leadership if enough Conservative MPs demand a ballot.

It was only last Friday that Washington and Moscow agreed to extend a series of diplomatic talks aimed at trying to resolve the gravest threat to European security since - at least - the Cold War.

But in the intervening period, actions by both sides appear to indicate they are preparing or bracing for a wider war in Ukraine or at the very least are designed to intensify pressure on each other.

For Russia that has meant a continuation of a massive build-up of troops and weaponry around Ukraine's borders, amplifying Western fears that a ""lightning war"" - as Prime Minister Boris Johnson put in on Monday - could be imminent despite Russian denials.

For Western allies, they are not yet in the business of attempting to match boot for boot, or tank for tank - it would be a very dark day were that to happen.

NATO has also always been mindful that any move its 30 member states make in Europe is viewed by Moscow as a provocation and a potential justification for Russian reinforcements in what could quickly become an escalatory ramp towards direct confrontation.

What's going on at the Russia-Ukraine border?

But the West is still mobilising and getting ready for the worst - just in slightly different ways.

On Monday morning NATO announced it was ""putting forces on standby"" and sending extra warships and jets to eastern Europe to reinforce its defences.

This includes a Danish frigate to the Baltic Sea, four Danish warplanes to Lithuania and Spanish ships to contribute to NATO naval forces.

Image: Ukraine's volunteer military units trained in a Kyiv park at the weekend

The deployments are small compared with the Russian display of military strength and are designed to strengthen NATO's defences - rather than directly protect Ukraine, which is not a member state.

But they still demonstrate the allies are not waiting for something to happen in Ukraine before acting.

In another signal that conflict is considered more likely than a diplomatic breakthrough, Washington and London announced a decision to order the departure of some staff and families from their respective embassies in Kyiv.

Both countries said it was because of the Russian threat, though Ukraine accused them of acting prematurely and showing ""excessive caution"".

The UK also took direct aim at Russia over the weekend, accusing Moscow of scheming to install a pro-Kremlin leader to head the government in Kyiv.

British officials will have known such a statement would infuriate the Russian government.

Britain has at times in the past refrained from publicly naming and shaming Moscow over suspected attacks and plots for exactly that reason.

But information is a weapon - no more so than at times of war - and it is being wielded by both sides.

Clearly a calculation was made by London, presumably with support from Washington, that now was the right time to shine a light on suspected Russian covert attempts to subvert Ukraine's freedoms from within.

Nothing has changed here for years.

The daily exchanges with Russian-backed separatists and, what the Ukrainians are certain of, professional Russian soldiers, goes on and on.

Their biggest fear is Russian drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras. They can hear them above - when the sound stops, the mortars and grenades begin.

Amongst their ranks are two professionally contracted soldiers, foreign fighters who've joined up.

Unusually, Johnny Wood and Sean Pinner are from England. Both say they have started new lives here - which is why they're fighting.

Sean Pinner was working in waste management in England when he decided he couldn't do the 16-hour days and long commutes on the M25 any longer.

So, he says he decided to change his life, and with his military background in mind, joined the Ukrainian army.

""I had a skill set with the Royal Anglian Regiment in the British Army for nine years, and the laws changed here. They allowed foreigners to join the military, and once that was established, I could give three years here, and then get my permanent residency or citizenship.""

Image: Sean was promoted to section commander of his unit just six months after joining up

Sean was promoted to section commander of his unit just six months after joining up.

It took him a while to earn the trust of his fellow soldiers, but he now considers himself one of them - more importantly perhaps, they consider him one of theirs.

""The first year was a bit sketchy because they don't know what to make of it, it's very, this is new, why would Brits want to come out here and do this? But now I'm three years with the marines,"" he explained.

This is Sean's fourth tour of duty in Ukraine. He speaks a bit of Russian and has married a Ukrainian. Their family home is just 15km (nine miles) from the frontline - he told me he can hear the shelling from his front room when he's at home.

""My home city is Mariupol, so for all intents and purposes I am defending my adopted city now, and my family.""

I asked him what that defence might that look like if a full-scale Russian invasion were to happen.

And he, like many Ukrainian soldiers I have met, is realistic but defiant.

""All I know is that the guys are well positioned, dug in, and will fight.

""We will all fight, because these guys are defending their homes, most of the guys you speak to - really - are looking to the West, not to Russia, to move forward with their lives.

""They want to go to [university], they want to go to Germany, to the US, and if they [Russia] come across the border we're outgunned.

""We haven't got air superiority, we don't have a naval fleet - very strong naval fleet - but Ukrainians fight, so we'll give them a bloody nose that's for sure.""

Sean's contract comes to an end in December, but he's got no plans to move back to England. He says he wants to retire from the military and live in Ukraine, perhaps moving into humanitarian work.

""It's taken me a long time to integrate here, so the guys know I'm not a war tourist or war junkie, and I am with an organised unit, I'm with the government… I've integrated, so they know I'm not just sitting around and going to go home at the end of it.""

Johnny Wood, 28, is on his third rotation. He and Sean have become good friends, often visiting each other at their frontline positions.

Like his fellow Brit, he owns a house in Ukraine and has plans to start a family.

Johnny says some people think he's crazy for joining up, and when they argue he shouldn't be here he does sometimes see their point - but ultimately, he points out, his life is here now.

""That's a true argument from their side, but I'm here, my fiancee is Ukrainian, I've got a house in Ukraine, I'm building a family.

""There will always be that person who says I shouldn't be here, but at the end of the day if I'm not here, like my government's not here, so like this is the best I can do by doing what my government can't do.""

The Ukrainian army has improved a lot since 2014, but even so it is infinitely outgunned by the Russian army.

""European governments need to give Ukraine more in terms of the capacity to be able to defend themselves,"" Johnny told me when I asked him what it might be like if Russia were to invade.

""I don't think we need to send British troops or American troops, all the West needs to do is support Ukraine politically.

""Like give them as much political support as we are doing, like ramp it up and just give them the weapons they need to defend themselves and defend their country.""

Officials said about 50,000 people had tried to attend the match.

The stadium has a capacity of 60,000 but it was not meant to be more than 80% full due to COVID restrictions.

Tight match overshadowed by off-the-pitch incident

On the pitch, Cameroon won the game 2-1 to reach the quarter-finals.

Strikers Karl Toko Ekambi and Vincent Aboubakar had given Cameroon the lead by the 70th minute against the tournament newcomers, who are ranked 132nd in the world and played with a defender in goal due to a coronavirus outbreak in the squad.

""Life became hard because I didn't want to undergo the cut,"" she told me.

""So he started beating me hard, torturing me, cutting me with razor blades, so that I give in.""

And then, one night a group came to her house.

Image: Virginia says her husband will kill her if he finds her

""That is when they forced me to have the cut. But before then they tortured me.

""They cut me with knives. I didn't want to sit down. They punched me around just to make me sit down, and at the end of it… I sat because the pain was too much for me.""

Virginia is not her real name. After she was cut she managed to escape, but then she started receiving threats from her husband and his gang, and says her family were targeted too.

She's afraid she will be killed if her husband tracks her down.

""They are coming for my head. I can't go back, I really can't go back. They are waiting for me to kill me. He will track me down.""

That's why she's sought asylum here in the UK, but she's had two claims turned down. She is now appealing again.

Migrant charity says asylum seekers are trapped in 'dysfunctional' system

Virginia's story is an example of why campaigners argue asylum law needs to be more flexible, and more compassionate.

To claim asylum you have to show that you are being persecuted because of who you are. That falls into five categories under the Geneva Refugee Convention: race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.

Gender itself is not grounds for persecution, but for those escaping gender-based violence, it can be argued that you are part of a particular social group that is being targeted.

You also need to show that your own country is unable or unwilling to help you.

Policy and advocate manager at the Joint Committee for the Welfare of Immigrants, Zoe Gardner, said: ""We are a compassionate country, people hearing the stories of these people would absolutely believe that we should be able to help those people.

Image: Policy and advocate manager at the Joint Committee for the Welfare of Immigrants, Zoe Gardner

""The Refugee Convention grounds are extremely strict and extremely tight… and definitely too narrow. And really what we're looking at in the future is also there's going to be more people who are forced to move and who are displaced, who don't fit under those grounds.

""I'm thinking in particular about climate change, and how that's going to force people out of their homes. And there's no provision in the Refugee Convention for climate refugees.

""So we really need to open up more pathways to legal movement for people in all different circumstances around the world.""

Does UK get more asylum claims and has Brexit made problem worse? Your questions answered

Virginia says the police where she lived were too scared of her husband's gang to act against him.

Immigration lawyer Harjap Singh Bhangal says the bar for granting asylum is incredibly high.

""There seems to be a sort of myth that asylum is easy to get in this country. It's not. It's really hard to get.

""When you ask for asylum, you're essentially asking for international protection because your life is at danger.

Image: Immigration lawyer Harjap Singh Bhangal

""And you've got to prove at the same time, that the state is unable or unwilling to help you and provide protection, and that it was probably impossible for you to internally relocate in your country. It's a very high threshold.""

Campaigners like Zoe Gardner argue this means vulnerable women and girls could fall through the cracks.

A Home Office spokesperson told Sky News: ""We take the wellbeing of asylum seekers extremely seriously and all evidence in their claims is carefully and sensitively considered against country information, which covers issues relating to female genital mutilation and domestic violence.

""Our key focus is on trying to prevent these crimes happening in the first place, including through our community engagement and international work, and co-operation with law enforcement at the border to raise awareness of gender-based crimes.""

This group showed interest in the tools at first but did not use them to open the nuts as the other communities did eventually lost interest in them over a few months.

However, a separate group of chimpanzees living less than four miles away did use the tools to crack nuts.

Dr Koops said this suggested the primates ""acquire cultural behaviours more like humans and do not simply invent a complex tool use behaviour like nut cracking on their own"".

The findings, published in Nature Human Behaviour journal ""help to shed light on what it is (and isn't) that makes human culture unique,"" she added.

After a lengthy council of war with President Biden and other European leaders, the prime minister is expected to step up diplomatic efforts to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

But he is facing more calls to quit from Opposition leaders after new allegations that he attended a party in the Cabinet Room in 10 Downing Street on his 56th birthday in June 2020.

What parties are alleged to have taken place in Whitehall and Downing Street during lockdown?

It is reported that about 30 guests sang Happy Birthday and ate Union Jack cake in the Cabinet Room before the PM was due to chair a COVID strategy meeting to discuss the route out of lockdown.

Besides Ukraine, the regular Tuesday Cabinet meeting will also include discussions on the growing cost of living crisis and could also hear calls to scrap the national insurance hike to pay for the NHS and social care.

At the same time, ahead of Sue Gray's ""partygate"" report, the PM is facing a renewed backbench mutiny and has also been forced to concede an inquiry into claims that a junior minister, Nusrat Ghani, was sacked because she is Muslim.

Mr Johnson's emergency talks with world leaders on the Ukraine crisis, held in a virtual meeting, ended in an agreement to take all steps to prevent a Russian invasion and implement tough sanctions if an invasion goes ahead.

""The leaders agreed on the importance of international unity in the face of growing Russian hostility,"" Downing Street said after the talks. ""The prime minister underlined the real human cost of any Russian aggression and the need to take all steps within our power to prevent that outcome.

""The leaders agreed that, should a further Russian incursion into Ukraine happen, allies must enact swift retributive responses including an unprecedented package of sanctions. They resolved to continue coordinating closely on any such response.""

The birthday party allegations

The latest allegations of partying inside 10 Downing Street arose from gatherings on Mr Johnson's 56th birthday on 19 June 2020. After a surprise birthday party in the Cabinet Room, it is claimed that in the evening family friends were hosted upstairs in the PM's flat, also breaking lockdown rules.

These allegations are particularly embarrassing for the prime minister because three months before his birthday in 2020, in March, Mr Johnson wrote to a seven-year-old girl, Josephine from Hampshire, after she told him she had postponed her birthday party.

""Josephine sets a fine example to us all by postponing her birthday party until we have sent coronavirus packing,"" the PM tweeted. And he concluded his tweet with the hashtag #BeLikeJosephine.

In a further blow to the embattled PM, barrister and lockdown law expert Adam Wagner said it appeared that the Cabinet Room gathering was a party and would have been against the rules at the time.

""If this was a purely social event (which the cake and M&S; food strongly suggest it was) then it can't have fallen within any of the list of exceptions to the strict gatherings rules,"" he said. ""So everyone attending would have been liable for a £100 fixed penalty notice or prosecution.""

'They have gone slightly over the top'

But responding to the allegations, first made by ITV News, Cabinet loyalist George Eustice admitted some of the recent partying allegations were more serious than the latest claims.

""My understanding is the prime minister had a small number of family, close family members, with him outdoors in the garden to celebrate his birthday,"" he said.

""I do trust what I am told on these things and I do think that in this saga there have been some quite serious allegations made. Those have been investigated.

""I don't think that these latest allegations that have been made fit into that category. I think they have gone slightly over the top.""

Downing Street says PM was there 'less than 10 minutes'

On the gathering in the afternoon of the PM's birthday, No 10 said: ""A group of staff working in No 10 that day gathered briefly in the Cabinet Room after a meeting to wish the prime minister a happy birthday. He was there for less than 10 minutes.""

But on claims about the PM's family upstairs in his flat in the evening, No 10 insisted: ""This is totally untrue. In line with the rules at the time, the prime minister hosted a small number of family members outside that evening.""

PM is a 'national disgrace'

The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, stepped up his demands for Mr Johnson to quit, declaring: ""This is yet more evidence that we have got a prime minister who believes that the rules that he made don't apply to him.

""And so we have a prime minister and a government who spend their whole time mopping up sleaze and deceit.

""Meanwhile millions of people are struggling to pay their bills and we cannot afford to go on with this chaotic, rudderless government. The prime minister is a national distraction and he's got to go.""

The Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey demanded a police investigation into the latest claims and said: ""This can't go on any longer.

Rebecca Lanette Taylor was arrested on Tuesday and charged with the sale or purchase of a child, according to NBC News.

The 49-year-old allegedly approached a mother-of-two in a self-checkout queue of a Walmart in Crockett, Texas on 13 January.

The mother, who has not been named, had her one-year-old son in the shopping trolley and her baby in a car seat.

Taylor reportedly commented on one of the children's blonde hair and blue eyes before asking ""how much she could purchase him for"", according to an affidavit seen by NBC News.

She went on to tell the woman she had $250,000 (£185,456) in her car and she would be willing to pay that for him, but the mother ""told her no amount of money would do"".

""Taylor said that he was the perfect fit and she had been wanting to buy a baby for a long time now,"" the affidavit stated.

After telling Taylor to stay away from her son, the mother said she was asked by another woman, who was with the accused, what her child's name was but she refused to tell her.

However, the pair seemed to already know his name and started ""calling him"".

The two women then left the store and the mother started heading towards her car.

As she approached the car park, they began shouting at her and Taylor stood behind a black SUV next to the mother's vehicle.

Taylor continued to tell the mother she would give her $500,000 for the child ""because she wanted him and she was going to take him"", the affidavit said.

Eventually, she got into a black car and drove off.

Police said CCTV footage from the store matched the mother's account.

On Thursday, Taylor was released from Houston County Jail on bond but could face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125041911/http://news.sky.com/story/texas-woman-arrested-for-allegedly-trying-to-buy-child-for-500-000-at-walmart-12524696;
1640;1640;COVID-19: At least 4,000 non-COVID excess deaths caused by pandemic in England, report finds, with 32,000 missing cancer treatment;Tuesday 25 January 2022 01:50, UK;['tim baker'];['covid-19', 'coronavirus', 'nhs'];['excess', 'absence', 'higher', 'finds', 'missing', 'covid19', 'staff', 'report', 'england', 'pandemic', 'noncovid', 'cancer', 'deaths', 'treatment', 'nhs', 'rates'];"Pressure on the NHS created by COVID led to at least 4,000 excess deaths from other conditions and mean that 32,000 cancer patients who should have started treatment are still waiting, according to new analysis.

The figures come from a new report published by the CAGE centre at the University of Warwick.

It is thought to be the first such report to lay out in detail the potential impact COVID had on people without the virus trying to access healthcare.

Among the major factors thought to have affected excess deaths during the first year of the pandemic are a lack of bed space and staff shortages due to infections in workers.

Nursing levels were particularly hard hit, compared to managers and doctors, the report found.

How many people died?

For excess deaths, the study looked at data provided by NHS England, and excluded anyone who tested positive for COVID or who had the disease mentioned on their death certificate.

It said: ""We estimate that, for the period from March 2020 to February 2021 alone, there have been at least 4,003 excess deaths of hospital patients in England that, if it were not for pandemic disruptions, would not have been expected to die.""

The 4,003 figure was noted as a ""lower-bound"" - with the real figure likely higher. It means that one non-positive person died due to COVID-related healthcare issues for every 30 who died with the virus.

What happened to waiting times?

A&E; wait times also increased due to the pandemic, and time-based targets for elective treatments fell and have failed to recover.

Before the pandemic, 97% of diagnostics took place within the NHS goal of six weeks.

NHS under pressure all over, but where are the pinch points?

This fell as low as 56% in the first wave, and has only reached a high of 71% since.

""Given that the waiting list tends to be around one million entries long, these delays have affected millions of patients over the course of the pandemic,"" the report said.

How has cancer treatment been affected?

The disruption also had a ""significant negative impact"" on cancer, with at least 32,189 people not getting treatment after a decision was made to start.

""We estimate that amongst detected urgent cancer cases, 53,068 people had their cancer care delayed past the NHS set goal,"" the report added.

What caused the delays?

Aside from the fact resources were diverted to treat those with the virus, the report found delays were caused due to NHS staff being exposed to higher infection risk when cases were rising, leading to staff absences.

Frontline NHS staff - especially nurses - saw higher absence rates when services were hit by a ""significant influx"" in COVID patients.

Vaccination of NHS staff was found to ""significantly reduce the link between COVID-19 admissions and staff absence rates"".

NHS health leader warns of 'compromised' NHS care

One of the authors of the study, Dr Christopher Rauh, said: ""Our work highlights the importance of both staff absence rates and the vaccination of critical healthcare staff.""

He added: ""We find that infections have led to higher staff absence rates which have a negative effect on the accessibility and quality of healthcare services.

""This along with simply increased pressures due to high numbers of admissions has led to the avoidable loss of lives both in the short as well as the long run, for example, due to worse cancer care.

Baroness Warsi, who was also a former Conservative minister, told Sky News it sends ""a shiver"" down the spines of British Muslims to know ""that this is the kind of thing that could be happening at the heart of government"".

At the weekend, Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani said she was told by a whip, who she did not identify, that her ""Muslimness was raised as an issue"" at a meeting in Downing Street.

She said she was also told that her ""Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable"" and that there were concerns ""that I wasn't loyal to the party as I didn't do enough to defend the party against Islamophobia allegations"".

Ms Ghani was sacked as transport minister in a February 2020 reshuffle.

On Monday morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a Cabinet Office inquiry into the matter and said he takes the matter ""extremely seriously"".

The prime minister told reporters: ""We take these allegations extremely seriously, I took them very seriously when they were raised with me 18 months ago... very glad there's an investigation taking place now.

""I can't say more, really, about it.""

Speaking to Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby, Baroness Warsi welcomed the PM's announcement of an inquiry but said she hopes ""a culture change comes off the back of it"".

The former Conservative Party co-chair said she ""wasn't surprised"" at Ms Ghani's allegation ""for two reasons"".

""One, because what has happened to Nus Ghani is an open secret in Westminster - me and many, many colleagues have been aware of this for many months and the way that she has struggled to be heard.

""But secondly, because the pattern in Nus's case is very similar to what I have seen in hundreds and hundreds of other complaints that have been made to the party about Islamophobia.

Analysis: MPs fear PM will not be able to survive scandals as Ghani's claims expose instability in No 10

""And the pattern is this - that the issue of Islamophobia is seen as far less serious than other forms of bigotry, that when the issue is raised that the response is quite aggressive and colleagues feel threatened and ostracised and feel like it will be a career ending issue.

""They always push this into bureaucracy and the onus is put back on the complainant and the victim rather than those who are told about this dealing with the matter proactively - and no action is usually taken until the media shine a spotlight on it.

""And all of those ring true with almost every case that we have seen within the party and they ring true with Nus's case.""

Image: Baroness Warsi says 'a culture change' is needed

Baroness Warsi added: ""An allegation of Islamophobia at the heart of government is even more disturbing... because in the end, the Conservative Party will have an impact on its members - and there are, what, a couple of hundred British Muslims who are members of the Conservative Party.

""But the government acts in the interests of all its citizens and there are nearly four million British Muslims in this country who are looking at government right now and thinking 'is it possible for a minister to lose her job simply because of her Muslimness?'

""And it sends a shiver down their spine to think that this is the kind of thing that could be happening at the heart of government.""

In the immediate aftermath of Ms Ghani's comments, chief whip Mark Spencer said he was the whip in question.

He described her allegations as ""completely false"", adding: ""I consider them to be defamatory. I have never used those words attributed to me.""

Asked if Mr Spencer could stay in his role while the inquiry is carried out, the PM said: ""This is something I take personally extremely seriously, I took it very seriously 18 months ago, we must wait and see what the investigation produces.""

Ms Ghani has also claimed that when she raised the matter directly with the PM, he told her he could not get involved.

The president had been holding the conference following a meeting with the White House Competition Council.

As reporters were being ushered out of the room, Fox News' White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked Mr Biden: ""Will you take questions on inflation then? Do you think inflation is a political liability ahead of the midterms?""

Despite voices in the background being heard saying ""no thank you"" after the question was put to the president, he responded without realising his microphone was still turned on.

""That's a great asset - more inflation. What a stupid son of a b***h,"" the president said.

After the blunder, his mic was quickly turned off and Mr Biden looked quite surprised as he appeared to notice his mistake.

The White House has insisted repeatedly that it is focused on curbing inflation, which is at a nearly 40-year high in the US.

""I couldn't even hear him'

Mr Doocy later appeared on Fox News to discuss the incident where he explained he didn't even hear the president's response and found out what had been said once the news conference had finished.

""I couldn't even hear him because people were shouting at us to get out but somebody came up to me a few minutes later in the briefing room and said, 'did you hear what the president said?'"" Mr Doocy added.

Joking around with the hosts of the show, he said: ""The White House and the communications officials here had been signalling last week when they had their first year in office anniversary that they were going to take a different approach with reporters.

The tempo of IS activity has been slowly building over recent months and the group has always made clear its intentions to storm the many prisons that now dot north-east Syrian countryside.

The prisons have long been a ticking time-bomb and the Kurds have been warning the West for years that they were struggling to cope.

The US and UK have donated millions of pounds in training, equipment and security features, but it isn't enough.

Many of the prisons are makeshift and not designed to hold inmates for years on end.

The prisoners are kept in dreadful conditions, in cramped cells, breeding an environment rife for uprising.

Let's not forget that it was in coalition-controlled prisons in Iraq post-2003 that many of IS's senior leaders met, planned and prepared for the creation of the group.

The Syrian Democratic Forces simply don't have the money or capability of holding tens of thousands Islamic State prisoners indefinitely, many of them foreign fighters who could be dispersed back to stand trial in their home countries.

But as much as this might have been inevitable, an attack of this scale suggests a serious failure of SDF intelligence; US too.

American forces are on the ground in the area and regularly carry out patrols, coalition aircraft fly daily intelligence and surveillance missions.

How did the planning for an assault of this kind go unmissed?

We can't dismiss the possibility that someone or some people were paid off - how else do you park two cars laden with explosives right outside the walls of the largest IS prison in Syria?

Intelligence failings aside, this shows Islamic State is still capable of carrying out an attack of this complexity and size.

Image: Islamic State fighters who were arrested after the prison was attacked. Pic: SDF via AP

Syria's competing factions had led to an absence of co-ordination which IS has exposed, moving fighters and equipment around the country, often untracked.

The Global Coalition has described the prison break as ""a desperate attempt for it to replenish its ranks and regain lost momentum"".

I don't fully agree.

In 2020, the United Nations estimated there were still around 10,000 IS fighters in Iraq and Syria - no small number.

The Gweiran Prison holds between 3,500 - 5,000 IS fighters - it's no surprise that IS would at some point have a crack at breaking them out.

And they've succeeded - we don't know how many have escaped, and probably never will, but the Islamic State group is slightly bigger and more emboldened than it was this time last week.

And as for momentum, the assault on Gweiran Prison is by some way the group's biggest success in three years or more, but it comes after months of smaller attacks in Syria and elsewhere around the world.

Unquestionably, IS will use the prison break for propaganda purposes.

It will be a considerable boost to sleeper cells in Iraq and Syria, as well as affiliates in Afghanistan and parts of Africa.

Islamic State is nothing like the force it was five years ago, but neither has it disappeared - it is showing signs of growing slowly stronger.

But the British Dental Association is warning that many practices simply don't have the capacity to increase their workload despite the extra investment.

Under the scheme - described by NHS England as a ""treatment blitz"" - dentists will be paid more than a third extra to work outside their normal hours and treat people in the early morning, evening, and at weekends.

Children, people with learning difficulties, autism or severe mental health problems will be prioritised.

It's hoped the fund will help to close the gap left after an estimated 38 million appointments were missed since the start of the pandemic.

Sara Hurley, the chief dental officer for England, said: ""More than 600 urgent dental health hubs were rapidly ramped up during the pandemic to deliver urgent care for patients and the NHS is now getting key services like dentistry back to pre-pandemic levels - injecting an extra £50 million into routine services will help provide check-ups and treatment for hundreds and thousands of people.""

However, Shawn Charlwood, the chair of the BDA general dental practice committee criticised the ""time limited offer"".

Issues with supply and service were most likely to cause trouble.

A number of the issues were related to COVID-19, according to the Institute of Customer Service (ICS).

The survey from the ICS found 13% of people had made a complaint in the past year.

This is up from the 11% figure reported six months ago.

The ICS survey is carried out twice a year, and was launched in 2008.

Availability, suitability, and quality the main issues

Some 10,000 people were asked about their experiences with businesses and how they interact with them.

As well as a rise in complaints, the ICS found 16% of people had experienced problems with a brand's service in the past six months.

And 34% of customers said they would be willing to pay more for better service - the highest proportion recorded.

Research found customers experienced greater problems with availability, suitability, and quality/reliability of goods and services, compared with 12 months ago.

However, a greater range of businesses were found at the top of the poll for best customer service.

Jo Causon, CEO at the ICS said: ""There is no easy remedy for rising prices and shortages of goods, so we must all become better at dealing with delays and disappointments.

""Although satisfaction with complaint handling and overall satisfaction has improved, we need to address wider service chain issues if we are to improve the nation's performance and productivity.""

She continued: ""More customers than ever before are willing to pay a premium for quality service.

""This suggests there is an opportunity to invest in delivering the real value that customers expect and deserve.

""Those that have made our top 10 make it easy to contact the right person, and build trust that they truly care about their customers.

The 46-year-old TV chef and restaurateur rose to fame in 1999 with his BBC television show, The Naked Chef.

Now, he is set to host a Channel 4 programme called the Great Cookbook Challenge with Jamie Oliver, in which he helps aspiring cooks release their own recipe collection.

Speaking about his first publishing deal, Oliver told the Radio Times: ""I was a special needs kid from school and I never thought I'd write a book.""

The chef has been open before about how he struggled in school with dyslexia, but has since learned how to not let it hold him back.

After his first show, Oliver says he was told: ""Oh, it's a shame. Normally, we do a cookbook with a series.""

""I said, 'I've got one. I've written down all my recipes for the last five years and they're in a bin liner.'""

These were written ""on the back of fag packs, beer mats and order checks"".

Since that time, Oliver has published numerous books and become a household name.

During his expansion into the publishing industry, Oliver says at times lived in the Penguin offices and helped dress bookshop windows to sell his books.

He says the first cookbook he was ever given was written by Delia Smith.

""She knew there's a logic between simplicity, accessibility and aspiration.

British musician Albarn made the comment about the pop star in an interview with the LA Times, adding: ""I'm not hating on anybody.""

Multi-award winning singer Swift said the claims are ""completely false"" and described them as ""damaging"".

Taking to Twitter, the 32-year-old addressed Albarn saying: ""I was such a big fan of yours until I saw this.

The James Webb Telescope fired rocket thrusters for about five minutes in a final course correction to enter orbit around the sun, with NASA confirming it had gone to plan.

Flight controllers back in Baltimore celebrated and NASA administrator Bill Nelson said it meant ""we're one step closer to uncovering the mysteries of the universe"".

James Webb will give a view further back in time than ever before, to the formation of the first galaxies and stars 13.7 billion years ago.

It will also scan for signs of alien life.

Considerably bigger than its predecessor, the Hubble telescope, the new observatory has a 6.5-metre gold-coated mirror and a sunshield as big as a tennis court.

The £7.5bn telescope - named after a former NASA chief - launched on Christmas Day from French Guiana and had been decades in the making.

Monday's final stop saw the telescope inserted at the second Lagrange point - or L2, where the gravitational forces of the sun and Earth balance.

""The final mid-course burn added only about 3.6 miles per hour (1.6 metres per second) - a mere walking pace - to Webb's speed, which was all that was needed to send it to its preferred 'halo' orbit around the L2 point,"" said NASA.

Scientists for the space agency say the pull of the sun and Earth will keep the telescope in place and mean little additional rocket thrust is needed.

It will always face Earth's night side to keep its infrared detectors as cold as possible.

Image: The telescope was launched on Christmas Day

Observations from the telescope will not start until June.

The mirror is made of 18 segments which must now be carefully aligned to achieve its proper focus.

Ground teams will also spend several months activating and calibrating instruments, such as the camera and spectrograph.

Fat stored under the skin, like a paunch or a double chin, is considered less harmful than fat stored around organs such as the liver and heart.

And according to researchers, the genes people are born with determine how and where this fat is stored.

Those with the lucky genes tend to have their fat stored under the skin rather than on their organs - reducing the risk of some diseases.

Anyone with a body mass index (BMI) over 30 is considered obese.

But two people with the same BMI can have very different amounts of fat, and that fat can be distributed in different places throughout the body.

Scientists say the study's findings could explain why some obese people remain relatively healthy, while others suffer from life-changing conditions such as heart disease.

Lead researcher from Brunel University London, Dr Hanieh Yaghootkar said: ""Some people have unlucky fat genes, meaning they store higher levels of fat everywhere, including under the skin, liver, and pancreas.

""That's associated with a higher risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes.

Read more: COVID-19 pandemic shines 'harsh light' on rising obesity in young people as NHS launches 15 clinics to tackle issue

""Others are luckier and have genes that mean higher fat under the skin but lower liver fat and a lower risk of diseases like type 2 diabetes.""

As part of the study, 37 diseases were tested. A total of 12 of those, including coronary artery disease and stroke, were found to be directly related to the genes which determine where the fat is stored.

Nine of the conditions were found to be unrelated to where a person's fat is stored and instead were most likely a result of simply carrying too much weight. These included deep vein thrombosis and arthritic knees.

People still urged to consider obesity as a hazard to their health

However, researchers continue to warn people that being obese is still a serious health hazard - regardless of fat storage location.

It is hoped the study will help doctors to determine if they should be targeting the adverse effects of someone's obesity, or be trying to get them to shed a few pounds.

Professor of human genetics at the University of Exeter, Timothy Frayling said: ""For example, there are many treatments that can lower the high-fat levels in the blood and around the organs that do not affect the extra weight a person carries.

""In contrast, for other conditions, it may be more important to reduce the extra weight as much as, or more than, the damaging high sugar and fat levels in the blood.""

Speaking to Sky News on the second anniversary of the tragedy, Andrew McGinley said he is now calling for legal reform in the Republic of Ireland to ensure the families of those who are mentally ill can be included in their treatment.

On 24 January 2020, Andrew's children Conor, nine, Darragh, seven, and three-year-old Carla were suffocated at the family home in Newcastle, Co Dublin by their mother Deirdre Morley.

In May 2021 she was found not guilty of their murders by reason of insanity and was committed to the Central Mental Hospital in Dublin.

Two years ago, Mr McGinley returned to his home from work as the emergency services arrived.

""I just arrived back and the first responders were there, the medics and the fire brigade,"" he said.

""It was then I thought 'where are the children?' I discovered the bodies in the house when I went in. You just think 'how does this happen to you, how does it happen to your family?'

""You read about it elsewhere. You just look for answers and two years later I'm still looking for answers. I know exactly how the children died. Now I just need to know why.""

Deirdre Morley had been receiving psychiatric care before the deaths, but Andrew said he hadn't realised the full extent of her illness.

Shortly before the children were killed, he said: ""Deirdre was talking about going back to work and was talking about recovery, about being nearly fully recovered.""

'It left me with more questions'

Now the bereaved father wants legislative reform so that families of those who are mentally ill can be included in their treatment.

""With every piece of information that came out in the trial, there was so much I was hearing for the first time,"" he said. ""It's just left me with so many more questions.

""If I was included all the way along, I wouldn't have those questions, I'd already know the answers. I just think it's vital for the support circle of people getting treatment, where it's appropriate, should be included.""

Asked if he has forgiven his wife, Mr McGinley said: ""I can't forgive how the children died. At the trial, it was relayed through the Garda files what Conor's last words were, and they haunt me. It's difficult.

Image: Mrs Morley had been receiving psychiatric care before the deaths

""I understand she was ill. The Dee I knew and loved was a loving, caring mother, she was a nurse. I accept she was ill, but it's hard to process.""

'You never recover, you cope'

Mr McGinley has now honoured his eldest child Conor's wishes for a YouTube channel by creating Conor's Clips, where he uploads videos of his children to nearly 8,000 subscribers.

""It was something he [Conor] had asked me about before Christmas 2020,"" said Mr McGinley. ""He'd started writing down ideas for what he wanted to do, and it was going to be little comedy clips and all five of us were going to be involved.""

""It's helped me cope. Helped me manage somewhat. People talk about recovery. You never recover, you cope and you manage.

""I dread to think if I didn't have Conor's Clips, what would I be doing. Because every morning the alarm clock goes off and it hits you like a sledgehammer, what's happened.

""But then the next thing I think about is what I can do for the kids, and what can I do with Conor's Clips. That's what helps me.""

Image: Mr McGinley says waking up every day is ""like a sledgehammer""

Mr McGinley has also set up a charity for his second son, called As Darragh Did, which marked the second anniversary by allocating €16,000 to good causes, and a snowman-themed colouring competition called Snowman for Carla.

He says these legacy projects are a way of keeping his children's memories alive, and help him cope with the trauma on a day-to-day basis.

""It's to remember them"", he said. ""It's to remember Conor, Darragh and Carla. To keep the promises.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125070804/http://news.sky.com/story/mental-health-irish-father-of-three-children-killed-by-their-mother-calls-for-law-reform-12524631;

The appeal relates to a lawsuit filed by script supervisor Mamie Mitchell, who alledges Baldwin fired a prop gun when it was not called for in the script.

It was the second suit brought against the actor following the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was shot on the set of the Western film on location in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in October.

Who was Halyna Hutchins? The tributes to 'brilliant' cinematographer following her death

Image: Script supervisor Mamie Mitchell (left) and her lawyer Gloria Allred held a media conference when they filed the lawsuit in November 2021

Baldwin's legal team say there is nothing in Ms Mitchell's allegations to suggest that anyone knew the prop weapon contained live ammunition leading up to the ""unprecedented"" incident.

""Nothing about the plaintiff's allegations suggest that any of the defendants, including Mr Baldwin, intended the prop gun to be loaded with live ammunition,"" lawyers said, in documents reported by US media outlets.

""Moreover, nothing about the plaintiff's allegations suggests any of the defendants knew the prop gun contained live ammunition.

""The absence of such allegations of course makes sense because the incident is apparently unprecedented in the filmmaking industry.""

Baldwin's lawyers made the submissions at Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday 24 January, according to court documents.

When filing the lawsuit in November, Ms Mitchell's lawyer Gloria Allred accused the actor of playing ""Russian roulette"" when he fired the gun without checking it and without having an armourer do so in his presence.

The star is also facing another lawsuit brought by the head of lighting on the film, Serge Svetnoy, who claimed he was suffering ""severe emotional distress"" following the incident.

As well as Baldwin, both lawsuits name nearly two dozen defendants associated with the film including David Halls, the assistant director who handed the actor the gun; and Hannah Gutierrez Reed, who was in charge of weapons on the set.

Tongan authorities had been wary of accepting international aid - due to the risk of COVID-19 - after the South Pacific island nation was hit by a tsunami following an undersea volcanic eruption almost two weeks ago.

Since the pandemic began, it has recorded just a single case of COVID-19 and avoided any outbreaks - and it is one of the few countries in the world that is currently completely virus free.

'They need aid desperately - but don't want the risk of COVID'

Australia's defence minister Peter Dutton said he was working with the Tongan authorities to keep HMAS Adelaide - which left Brisbane last week - at sea to make sure there is no threat to Tonga's 105,000 residents, after 23 crew members tested positive for the virus.

""They need the aid desperately, but they don't want the risk of COVID,"" Mr Dutton told Sky News.

""We will work through all of that as quickly as we can.""

Data suggests about 61% of Tongans are fully vaccinated.

It is the second aid shipment that has been sent to the archipelago after the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai underwater volcano erupted on 13 and 15 January.

A C-17 Globemaster military transport plane was turned around mid-flight after somebody was diagnosed with the virus.

Communications being restored

A cable company official has said internet services could be restored within two weeks, although the connection to the smaller islands may take longer to repair.

Some limited international call services have been restored.

Samieula Fonua, who chairs the board at Tonga Cable Ltd, the state-owned company which owns the fibre-optic cable, said a repair ship had left from Papua New Guinea and was due to stop over in Samoa by Monday to pick up supplies.

It should arrive in Tonga by 1 February, with repairs to the cable expected to happen by 8 February, restoring internet to 80% of Tonga's customers.

1667;1667;Australian Open: 'Where is Peng Shuai?'

Tennis stars joined in the criticism after footage emerged on Sunday of a woman being intercepted at Melbourne Park wearing a shirt with an image of Peng on the front and the message ""Where is Peng Shuai?"" on the back.

Peng disappeared from public view for nearly three weeks in November 2021 when she appeared to accuse a former Chinese vice premier, Zhang Gaoli, of sexually assaulting her in the past.

Last month she denied ever accusing anyone of sexual assault and said a social media post she had written had been misunderstood.

Tennis Australia first responded by stating that the clothing breached its rule on ""political messaging"".

Fans are free to wear, ""Where is Peng Shuai?"" shirts at the Australian Open but they must not become ""disruptive"", Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley said on Tuesday amid criticism of its earlier stance on the issue.

""If anyone's coming on site with the express intent of disrupting the comfort and safety of our fans, they're not welcome,"" he said.

""We can't sell tickets in advance and have people come in and feel unsafe because there's a large group of people that are using (the tournament) as a platform to espouse their views on whatever topic it is.""

He added that the security worker was following the tournament's protocols at the weekend, but following a review, the woman involved in the incident would be invited back to the tournament because she was not trying to cause disruption.

Activists are now reportedly planning to distribute hundreds of ""Where is Peng Shuai?"" T-shirts in time for Saturday's Australian Open women's final.

Image: Navratilova had criticised the tournament organisers' earlier stance on the issue

U-turn on ban welcomed

Tennis great Martina Navratilova and French player Nicolas Mahut had voiced their outrage about the crackdown.

Mahut said the restrictions came as Melbourne Park carried signage for 1573, a Chinese distillery.

""What's going on!?"" What lack of courage! What if you did not have Chinese sponsors #1573. beyond disappointed,"" he posted on social media.

Three-time Australian Open singles champion Navratilova had accused the Australian Open of being ""cowardly"" and ""capitulating"" to China by preventing fans from wearing T-shirts showing support for Peng.

Responding to the U-turn, Navratilova tweeted: ""This is excellent news - well done Australian Open and kudos to Craig Tiley for doing the right thing here!!! #whereisPengShuai""

Tennis Australia: Peng's safety is our primary concern

Tennis Australia organisers had previously said: ""To ensure that the Australian Open remains a welcoming, safe and inclusive event for everyone, we have a longstanding policy of not allowing banners, signs or clothing that are commercial or political.""

In a later statement, Tennis Australia said it understood ""people have strongly held personal and political views on a range of issues"".

The party's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the rules around gatherings at the time were ""clear"" and this event ""breaches the rules"".

He told Sky News: ""Why was there one rule for young people across the country who couldn't have birthday parties, for our own Queen and sovereign who couldn't have a birthday party, but a different situation for Boris Johnson?""

What is alleged to have happened on 19 June 2020?

Downing Street has admitted staff ""gathered briefly"" in the Cabinet Room on the day in question.

ITV News reported 30 people attended and shared cake, despite mixing between households indoors being banned at the time.

Its report added that Carrie Johnson, the PM's wife, had organised the surprise get-together, which also included a rendition of Happy Birthday for Mr Johnson.

Those present are understood to have eaten picnic food from Marks & Spencer at the gathering which is said to have lasted for about 20 to 30 minutes.

Interior designer Lulu Lytle has admitted she was at the event, but said she was only there ""briefly"" while waiting to talk to the PM about the refurbishment of the couple's Downing Street flat.

In the evening, family friends were hosted upstairs in the prime minister's official residence in a further breach of the rules, ITV has reported.

In response to the claim of the afternoon event, a Number 10 spokeswoman said: ""A group of staff working in Number 10 that day gathered briefly in the Cabinet Room after a meeting to wish the prime minister a happy birthday.

""He was there for less than 10 minutes.""

Disclosure adds to string of 'partygate' claims

It is the latest in a string of events that took place in Downing Street and government departments during COVID restrictions in 2020 and 2021.

Mr Johnson has admitted attending a garden party in Downing Street in May 2020, which was described by one of his aides as a ""bring your own booze"" event.

But he has claimed he thought it was a ""work event"" and that ""nobody told me"" it was against the rules.

The revelation that officials held two parties in Downing Street the day before the Queen sat alone at Prince Philip's funeral in April last year has also provoked fury.

Number 10 later apologised to the Queen and said Mr Johnson was not in Downing Street that day.

The row, dubbed ""partygate"", has led to calls for the PM to resign and seen some of his own MPs call for him to go.

A Cabinet Office investigation, led by senior civil servant Sue Gray, is due to report back this week.

A Cabinet Office spokesperson said this inquiry, led by senior civil servant Sue Gray ""is continuing"", and there is ""ongoing contact"" with the Met.

Sky News understands Ms Gray's report will not be published while the Met's investigation is ongoing.

Reacting to the news, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson had become a ""national distraction"" and should resign.

""With Boris Johnson's Downing Street now under police investigation, how on earth can he think he can stay on as prime minister?""

How did we get here?

Disclosures surrounding a range of gatherings in Downing Street and a number of government departments during COVID restrictions in 2020 and 2021 have put pressure on Boris Johnson, with the prime minister facing calls to resign from opposition parties and some of his own backbench MPs.

In the latest revelation, Number 10 has admitted the PM had a birthday celebration inside Downing Street during the first COVID lockdown in 2020.

Mr Johnson has already admitted attending a garden party in Downing Street in May of that year, which was described by one of his aides as a ""bring your own booze"" event.

But he has claimed he thought it was a ""work event"" and that ""nobody told me"" it was against the rules.

The revelation that officials held two parties in Downing Street the day before the Queen sat alone at Prince Philip's funeral in April last year has also provoked fury.

Number 10 later apologised to the Queen and said Mr Johnson was not in Downing Street that day.

What happens now?

The Met wrote to the Cabinet Office on Tuesday morning, formally requesting that it refers all relevant information from its inquiry in relation to the events under investigation to support the force's work.

At this stage there is no estimate for how long its investigation will take.

Commissioner Dick said the force will not be giving a ""running commentary on our current investigations"", but updates will be provided at ""significant points"".

And she said the fact that police were now investigating a number of events does not mean that fixed penalty notices ""will necessarily be issued in every instance and to every person involved"".

Police had assessed ""several other events"" that appeared to have happened in Downing Street and in Whitehall, but they were not thought to have reached the threshold for criminal investigation, the commissioner told the London Assembly.

Met chief explains police approach to past allegations of rule-breaking

Setting out the force's approach towards historic allegations of COVID rules being broken, Commissioner Dick said it would ""not normally be"" a proportionate use of the Met's resources.

But she said investigations were launched for ""the most serious and flagrant type of breach"" where there was evidence and three criteria were met.

""My three factors were and are: there was evidence that those involved knew, or ought to have known that what they were doing was an offence.

""Where not investigating would significantly undermine the legitimacy of the law.

""And where there was little ambiguity around the absence of any reasonable defence.

""So in those cases, where those criteria were met, the guidelines suggested that we should potentially investigate further and end up giving people tickets.""

'We police without fear or favour'

Prior to her statement, Commissioner Dick was told that public trust in the Met had ""severely waned"" given how the parties in Downing Street had taken place in such proximity to the force's officers.

But defending the force, she said: ""We police without fear or favour. We police impartially and we police in an operationally independent manner.""

Commissioner Dick said she understood the ""deep public concern"" about the allegations.

She added: ""The vast majority of people have acted responsibly during the pandemic, many, many people - including many Londoners and my colleagues - have made huge sacrifices and they have suffered considerable loss during the pandemic.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125111741/https://news.sky.com/story/met-launches-investigation-into-a-number-of-downing-street-events-12524866;

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday that the situation is ""under control"" and there is ""no reason to panic"".

However, the Ukrainian government has acknowledged the threat from Russia is real and is due to accept a shipment of US military equipment to bolster its defences.

Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said that, as of Monday, Russia's armed forces had not formed what he called battle groups, ""which would have indicated that tomorrow they would launch an offensive"".

""There are risky scenarios. They're possible and probable in the future,"" he told Ukraine's ICTV channel on Monday. ""But as of today... such a threat doesn't exist.""

Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine's national security and defence council, echoed that sentiment, saying: ""As of today, we don't see any grounds for statements about a full-scale offensive on our country.""

The statements come as Russia started making combat readiness inspections, involving more than 6,000 troops, in its southern military district which borders Ukraine, the Russian state-owned news agency RIA has reported.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement on developments in the region in the House of Commons today, where he said he joined a virtual meeting with world leaders including US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, last night.

Mr Johnson said: ""We agreed that we would respond in unison to any Russian attack on Ukraine, in unison by imposing co-ordinated and severe economic sanctions heavier than anything we have done before against Russia.

""And we agreed on the necessity of finalising these measures as swiftly as possible in order to maximise their deterrent effect.""

The prime minister also warned that if the ""worst happens"" in Ukraine the country's resistance ""would be dogged and tenacious, and the bloodshed comparable to the first war in Chechnya or Bosnia"".

It comes as Foreign Minister Liz Truss has said she will visit Ukraine next week, as she reiterated a warning to Russia that any incursion into Ukrainian territory would come at a severe economic cost.

Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said Russian President Vladimir Putin will talk to his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron later this week.

Mr Macron is also planning to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

The US move is in tandem with actions by other NATO member governments to bolster a defensive presence in eastern Europe.

Denmark is sending a frigate and F-16 warplanes to Lithuania, Spain is sending four fighter jets to Bulgaria and three ships to the Black Sea to join NATO naval forces, and France stands ready to send troops to Romania.

However, Germany has chosen not to supply Ukraine with weapons - despite the Ukrainian government asking for defence aid.

Russia has massed an estimated 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine in recent weeks but denies it is preparing to invade - denouncing US and NATO preparations for war as Western ""hysteria"".

Intense diplomatic activity in recent weeks has failed to ease tensions.

The UK is withdrawing some diplomats and dependents from its embassy in the Ukrainian capital, while the US State Department has ordered the families of all American personnel at the US Embassy in Kyiv to leave the country, and said non-essential embassy staff could leave.

Ukraine, a former Soviet state, has been locked in a bitter tug-of-war with Russia for almost eight years.

In 2014, following the removal of a Kremlin-friendly president in Ukraine, Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in the country's industrial heartland in the east.

The fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels has since killed more than 14,000 people, and efforts to reach a peaceful settlement have stalled.

In the latest stand-off, Russia has demanded guarantees from the West that NATO would never allow Ukraine to join and that the alliance would curtail other actions, such as stationing troops in former Soviet bloc countries.

Some of these, like any pledge to permanently bar Ukraine, are non-starters for NATO, creating a seemingly intractable stalemate that many fear can only end in war.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125160713/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraines-leaders-appeal-for-calm-and-say-attack-is-not-imminent-as-russia-makes-combat-readiness-inspections-near-border-12525021;

Lisa Smith, 39, from Dundalk in Co Louth, has pleaded not guilty to charges of being a member of the so-called Islamic State group and with financing terrorism.

She left the Irish military after she converted to Islam in 2011 and later travelled to IS-controlled territory in Syria.

There, after a previous marriage ended, she married Sajid Aslam, a UK national who the prosecution contends undertook ""border patrol"" for Islamic State.

The Special Criminal Court in Dublin was told that Aslam ""had done a snipers course on her advice.""

Lisa Smith had a daughter, born in June 2017, before returning to Ireland in December 2019 after the collapse of Islamic State's territory.

She was arrested at Dublin Airport and charged with terror offences.

On Tuesday - the first day of her trial - prosecuting counsel Sean Gillane SC told the court that Ms Smith had ""endeavoured to access IS-controlled territory and sought out the means by which this could be done"".

He said that ""she subscribed to the reciprocity of allegiance and protection, and in that sense, she enveloped herself in the standard or black flag of Islamic State"".

'No split between good and bad IS'

Mr Gillane continued that ""there is no duality or split between a good Islamic State and a bad one, into which one might fall by happenstance or misfortune"".

It is the prosecution's case that to ""make hijra"" (emigrate) in this specific context is ""a central act of allegiance to this proto-state"", and an ""act without which the terrorist group cannot survive"".

""It is the lifeblood of the Islamic State,"" Mr Gillane continued.

Execution by drowning in a cage

""It needed fighters, and it is our case that it also needed all those who could give sustenance and vitality to the group... to answer that call in this context is to self-identify as a member of that group.""

The court also heard of Lisa Smith's involvement with various Facebook and Telegram groups. In one discussion about IS's execution of five men by drowning in a cage, the prosecution said that Lisa Smith replied: ""OK, now I understand why they were drowned. I didn't know the other half of the story.""

The prosecution was due to continue outlining its case on Tuesday afternoon.

""If only people knew how hard he works to get fitter and how low his confidence has been. Don't worry Alfie I'll always be your biggest fan.""

South African World Cup winner Tendai Mtawarira, known as 'Beast', was one of the famous names who told the youngster he had faced similar issues.

""People silently bullied me about my size and questioned whether I was the correct age for my age group,"" he replied on Twitter.

""Keep your head high and never let the haters get to you. The game of rugby is for all.""

Aside from the Premiership Final, there may be another top-level match in store for him, as current Wales star, Louis Rees-Zammit, tweeted: ""I want to see you at a Gloucester game ASAP"".

England legend Brian Moore told the boy those trolling him are ""idiots who try to make themselves feel better by running down other people"".

1682;1682;Dorset knob-throwing competition too popular to be held, organisers say;Tuesday 25 January 2022 15:56, UK;['tim baker'];['dorset'];['website', 'held', 'competition', 'knob', 'village', 'popular', 'valley', 'event', 'dorset', 'say', 'knobthrowing', 'biscuit', 'moores', 'organisers', 'festival'];"Dorset's 'knob-throwing' festival has become too large to hold, according to organisers.

The Dorset Knob Throwing and Frome Valley Food Festival - which includes a contest to throw a type of biscuit called a knob as far as possible - was last held in 2019.

It was first held in the Dorset village of Cattistock in 2008.

The event has not been held since due to the pandemic.

And in a post on its social media page, the organisers said: ""It is with great sadness that the Dorset Knob Throwing and Frome Valley Food Festival is unable to go ahead on 1 May 2022.

""We had over 8,000 people attend the 2019 event, meaning it has reached such a size that it simply cannot be run by a small village committee.

""We've looked at various options but sadly couldn't make any of them work for this year for many reasons.

""We also sadly lost the support of our event management team late in 2021 and agreements with Moores Biscuits to provide the biscuits for the event's games also took much longer than anticipated.

""We hope the event can return in years to come.""

The Dorset knob is ""a savoury biscuit that is crisp, golden, and steeped in tradition"", according to Moores Biscuits.

On the knob-throwing committee's website, the competition rules are set out.

It states: ""Three knobs are thrown underarm and the furthest is measured at its final resting place; unlimited entries are available per contestant and there are no age restrictions"".

Named after a ball-like clothing fastener

One foot must stay on the ground while throwing.

The furthest knob thrown is measured - if the baked good breaks, the umpire decides where to measure from.

The Moores Bakery website says the biscuit takes its name from a Dorset Knob button - which is where a button is sewn around to make a ball-like clothing fastener.

It adds: ""The Dorset Knob started life sometime before 1860 when the Moores family began baking in West Dorset.

""After the day's bread baking was finished it was the custom to make Dorset Knobs by adding butter and sugar to the leftover dough and hand rolling them in small buttons.

""They were then baked in the dying heat of the bread oven to dry them out like rusks.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125160713/http://news.sky.com/story/dorset-knob-throwing-competition-too-popular-to-be-held-organisers-say-12525065;

Following a seven-week trial, Star's mother Frankie Smith, 20, and her partner, Savannah Brockhill, 28, were convicted over her death.

Brockhill was found guilty of Star's murder. Smith was found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a child.

The court heard concerned family and friends made at least five referrals to social services in the eight months leading up to her death.

However, the case was repeatedly closed as the local authority failed to recognise the scale of abuse that was being inflicted on the toddler.

Warning: This story contains distressing details about the treatment and subsequent death of a child.

Image: Star Hobson died in September 2020 from injuries she received at her home

Smith gave birth to Star just before her 18th birthday, in May 2019.

Months later, she separated from Star's father, Jordan Hobson, and quickly began a relationship with Brockhill after they met at a pub.

The first referral is made

Smith's friend Hollie Jones raised concerns over the care of Star and potential domestic violence issues between the couple and made the first referral on 23 January 2020.

Police and social services visited, but no concerns were raised, and the case was dropped.

In February, Smith's great-grandmother, Anita Smith, looked after Star for 10 weeks. She said when she picked Star up, the child appeared depressed and had lost weight.

Smith visited Star a couple of times when she was under Anita's care, with Star gaining weight and seeming happier.

Referrals dismissed

In May 2020, Anita Smith made a second referral to social services - but the case was closed, with the couple claiming the complaint was ""malicious"".

The following month, Jordan Hobson put the third referral in to social services after seeing a video of Star on Facebook where she had bruises on her face.

Smith blamed this on an accident involving a coffee table, and although she was taken to hospital by social services, the doctor concluded it was nothing unusual.

Two days later, a close friend of Smith's mother made a fourth referral. Videos taken on Brockhill's phone around this time show a number of clips where Star appears exhausted and treated without love - including one where she falls off her chair and a laugh is heard.

On 2 September, a fifth referral is made by Frank Smith, Star's paternal great-grandfather. Police and social services visited, but Smith was not present.

Smith dismisses concerns over bruising

An unannounced visit on 4 September saw Smith brush off concerns about bruising.

The house officer then attempted to arrange a meeting, but Smith repeatedly postponed, making excuses such as Star having a sickness bug.

Nine days later, CCTV images appeared to show Brockhill striking Star 21 times while she is staying with her at work. The footage, from a camera at a recycling plant in Doncaster where Brockhill was working, showed her delivering repeated blows to the child over the course of three hours while she sat in her car seat.

On 15 September, social services closed the case.

Star died a week later, on 22 September.

The day before, CCTV showed her mother dragging her through Bradford like a puppet, with the toddler seen crying when she tried to walk.

The day of Star's murder

On the day of Star's death, Smith texted Brockhill that she had ""had enough"".

In an exchange, Brockhill said: ""You doing? x""

Smith replied: ""Sorting this child out, gave her food and she ate it all and now she's sat on the floor saying no and nipping and biting her arm.""

Brockhill: ""Daft child.""

Smith: ""Ragged my hair out, smacked me, sick to death of it.""

Brockhill: ""Do what you did last night and put her in a corner.""

Smith: ""Done it. Stood crying at the wall.""

Brockhill: ""Good x""

Just before 3pm, Brockhill arrived at Smith's flat to discover Star had torn up a ticket from Smith's favourite band. The internet search history on Brockhill's phone showed ""Rubettes signed ticket"" at 3.03pm.

At 3.34pm, the internet search history on Smith's phone showed ""how to bring a baby out of shock"" and ""shock in babies"".

At 3.45pm, Smith called 112, which went through to an operator in Glasgow. Glasgow then contacted West Yorkshire Police, and at the same time Smith texted 999.

Four minutes later, Smith's phone was put through to the ambulance service, where Brockhill tells the operator she ""heard a bang"" and found Star on the floor.

Paramedics arrived at 4.04pm to find Star lifeless and pale, wearing only a disposable nappy.

She was taken to hospital and pronounced dead just before 5pm.

Image: A referral was dismissed as 'malicious'

Social services response

A joint statement from safeguarding agencies in Bradford said they ""deeply regret"" missing warning signs in Star's case.

The statement was given by Marium Haque, interim director of children's services at Bradford Council, Helen Hirst, chief officer, Bradford District and Craven Clinical Commissioning Group, and Bradford District Commander Chief Superintendent Sarah Jones of West Yorkshire Police.

It said: ""We want to say first and foremost that we're sorry for the death of Star. This was a child's life cut cruelly short.

""Anyone who has followed the trial will want to know what more could have been done to help protect Star.""

The agencies said there was much to learn from the case, and that action had been taken to ""improve our practice so that we learn those lessons - but we need to fully understand why opportunities to better protect Star were missed"".

""We must also learn everything we can from the awful murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes. A national review has been established to enable this to happen. If we can contribute our learning to this review, we will do.""

The agencies said ""support and assistance"" was offered to Star's family at the time, ""but we all deeply regret that not all the warning signs were seen that could have led to firmer statutory enforcement action"".

A Local Child Safeguarding Practice Review, being written by an independent author, is expected to be published next month.

""It will provide partners and colleagues in our district and across the country with clear recommendations so we can better protect children in our care,"" the statement added.

The Department for Education said the death of Star was ""deeply disturbing"" and added it would ""not hesitate"" to remove children's services control from Bradford Council ""if necessary"".

Police conduct investigation

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) began an independent investigation in October 2020 following a referral from West Yorkshire Police, due to the fact officers had contact with Star's family prior to her death.

A spokesperson said: ""Our investigation, which will look at the police response to two reports Star suffered injuries in the months before her death in September 2020, was suspended while criminal proceedings took place.

""Our investigation will resume once the trial has concluded.""

They added: ""Our thoughts are with Star Hobson's family, loved ones and all those affected by her tragic death.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125160713/http://news.sky.com/story/star-hobson-after-five-referrals-to-social-services-what-opportunities-were-missed-to-save-16-month-old-toddler-12489862;

Shane Lee Brown has accused two police departments in Nevada in the federal civil rights lawsuit of wrongful arrest and negligence.

The 25-year-old alleges that Henderson and Las Vegas police detained him for six days after mistaking him for Shane Neal Brown when he was pulled over in January last year, NBC News reports.

The lawsuit claims that the mix-up began after the traffic stop, in which he failed to provide a driver's licence, prompting his arrest.

After he was pulled over, Brown ""established his identity by providing his name, social security number, and social security card to the officer"", the lawsuit states.

It adds: ""While performing a records check, the unknown HPD Officers confused Shane Lee Brown with a different Shane Brown, a 49-year-old white man, who was the subject of an outstanding felony bench warrant for ownership or possession of firearm by prohibited person.""

The younger Brown was held in the Henderson Detention Center from 8 to 10 January 2020. He was then transported to the Clark County Detention Center after a bench warrant issued by Las Vegas police certified that ""Shane Brown"" was the man wanted on the felony warrant, the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit describes Shane Neal Brown as 5ft 11in with brown hair, blue eyes and a bushy white beard, and says he had been convicted of a crime in 1994.

Shane Lee Brown, however, is 5ft 7in and was not even born when the other Shane Brown was convicted, the lawsuit claims.

A judge authorised his release on 14 January 2020, after having been informed of his identity by public defender Shannon L Phenix, the lawsuit says.

The lawsuit added that the younger Brown had repeatedly told police officers and their supervisors that he was not the older, white Shane Brown who was wanted on the felony warrant.

In addition to the two police departments, the lawsuit also names Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, the head of the Las Vegas police, Henderson Police Chief Thedrick Andres, and the city of Henderson as defendants.

A spokesperson for Las Vegas police declined to comment on behalf of the department and Lombardo on Monday, citing ""pending litigation"".

Records show that the older Brown accepted a plea deal and was sentenced to up to six years in prison with credit for time served in February 2020.

Shane Lee Brown was not charged with any crime, and according to his lawsuit, is seeking a jury trial and more than $500,000 (£371,146) in compensatory damages.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125160713/http://news.sky.com/story/black-man-spends-days-in-jail-after-being-mistaken-for-a-suspect-who-is-white-and-twice-his-age-12524857;

Her family said: ""It is with the heaviest of broken hearts that we must announce Isla gained her angel wings early hours of this morning, it was very peaceful and surrounded by the continued love of Nicola, Michael & Millie.

After becoming ill at the age of two, Isla was initially treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, according to West Ham United.

Isla's mother Nicola Caton launched a fundraising campaign in May 2017 to help pay for her daughter's care, which received support from the likes of boxer Tyson Fury, rapper Guvna B and dozens of former players.

""We were told in 2018 that Isla had three months to live so we sold everything we had and raised a lot of money and took Isla to Barcelona for life-saving treatment,"" her mother Nicola Caton said on her fundraising page.

""We stayed in Spain for two years fighting but when COVID hit we had to return home.""

In March 2019, it was announced that Isla was cancer-free, but the disease came back.

Family told treatment was 'no longer effective'

Her mother previously said that in the past five years Isla ""has undergone more treatment than I can even express - from chemo, radiation, two stem cell transplants, countless amounts of bone marrow taken, brain surgery as well as a 12-hour op to remove the main tumour.""

""She has had immunotherapy and MIBG therapy as well as so so much more,"" she continued.

In December 2021, her parents Nicola and Michael were told that her treatment was no longer effective and she would have just a few weeks to live.

On Isla's last JustGiving page, Nicola said: ""We have now decided to spend our time making sure Isla has the most wonderful life we can give her and to make as many amazing memories as we can so instead of fundraising for medical costs we now feel it's time to give Isla as much happiness as humanly possible - if anyone deserves it, it's our baby girl.""

She added: ""Isla is a real life superhero and we pray with all we are that we can get her well but for now we live for today and make that as magical as we can.""

The country first legalised the use of marijuana in 2018 for medical use and research, but now the Narcotics Control Board has dropped it from its list of controlled drugs.

People can grow cannabis plants at home under the new rule, but must notify their local government first, health minister Anutin Charnvirakul said.

He added that cannabis cannot be used for commercial purposes without further licences.

Recreational marijuana use in grey area

The rule must be published in the official Royal Gazette and 120 days must pass before home cannabis plants will become legal.

It comes after cannabis was removed from the list of illegal drugs under Thailand's Narcotics Law last month.

Production and possession of marijuana remain regulated for now due to a tangle of related laws - leaving the legal status of recreational marijuana use in a grey area.

Police and lawyers said it was unclear if possession of marijuana would no longer be an offence subject to arrest.

But the country's health ministry is set to present a separate draft bill to parliament this week, which will provide details on the legal use of cannabis, including its production and commercial use, as well as guidelines on recreational use.

Paisal Dankhum, a food and drug regulator chief, previously said that homegrown cannabis should be used for medical purposes like traditional medicine, adding there would be random inspections.

Hefty fines

The draft bill pledges that those who grow cannabis without notifying the government could face fines of up to 20,000 baht (£449).

And people who sell the plant without a licence could be handed a fine of up to 300,000 baht (£6,742) or three years in jail.

Health minister Mr Anutin has been the driving force behind decriminalising the drug in Thailand, and the latest rule is expected to help promote cannabis products as a major industry in the country.

Last week, he said that the delisting ""responds to the government's urgent policy in developing marijuana and hemp for medical and health care benefits, developing technology and creating income for the public"".

In October, an off-duty Dr Tom Prichard helped restart a fan's heart after they collapsed in the stands at Newcastle United's ground St James' Park.

Last night Dr Prichard was working for Middlesbrough FC's medical team when an elderly man collapsed in the stands at Ewood Park during a game against Blackburn Rovers.

The Rovers supporter, who was situated in the lower tier of the Jack Walker Stand, took ill midway through the second half.

With the help of Middlesbrough physiotherapist Chris Moseley, CPR was carried out, before the man was transferred to an ambulance and then hospital.

The game - which Blackburn won 1-0 - was halted for 12 minutes while the emergency was handled.

In a statement, Blackburn praised both club medical teams for treating the man, adding that he was later ""alert and stable"".

Middlesbrough manager Chris Wilder was praised for alerting the referee to the situation in the stands.

Speaking after the game, Blackburn Rovers manager Tony Mowbray said: ""It was mentioned in the dressing room, the whole team were asking after him.

""This club is a very caring club about the community and we'll be doing everything we can to support the gentleman and his family and we wish him well.""

While he was on duty for yesterday's game, Dr Prichard was just a fan at a match between Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur four months ago.

""It was all very difficult. He was trapped in between some seats. It was quite noisy. I couldn't hear what the defibrillator was telling me. It was all a bit different. So it was a bit of a struggle. But plenty of extra support arrived which was very helpful.""

The PM is under pressure following a raft of disclosures surrounding gatherings in Downing Street and a number of government departments during COVID restrictions.

Mr Johnson has already admitted attending a garden party in Downing Street in May of that year, which was described by one of his aides as a ""bring your own booze"" event.

Dr Gary Jenkins, 54, suffered multiple brain injures when he was assaulted in Bute Park, Cardiff, in the early hours of 20 July 2021.

He died at the University of Wales hospital on 5 August.

Jason Edwards, 25, Lee Strickland, 36, and a 17-year-old girl who cannot be named for legal reasons are on trial for his murder at Merthyr Crown Court in South Wales.

Dafydd Enoch, prosecuting, said the attack was motivated by ""greed, homophobia and straight-up violence"".

He told the court that the trio had been ""in search of vulnerable gay men who were in the park for sex"" to rob when they set upon Dr Jenkins, who pleaded for his life.

The teenager was 16 at the time and Lewis Williams, a witness who tried to intervene, described her as ""evil"" and ""sadistic"", the court was told.

Mr Enoch said audio from nearby CCTV picks up the girl shouting ""money"" before all three defendants laugh as they punch and kick the consultant psychiatrist.

""He pleads over and over again until he cannot speak no more,"" Mr Enoch said.

""He then moans and grunts as he's cruelly beaten and the life is kicked out of him.""

""Edwards says, 'Stamp on his head, stamp on his head'. There's homophobic abuse. [The youth] at the end is heard saying, 'Yes, I needed that'. These defendants were indulging in sport.""

Defendants admit manslaughter

Mr Enoch said the girl was filmed on CCTV cameras meeting her co-defendants and after buying alcohol at the nearby Esso garage on Cathedral Road, they entered the park via the Castle Road entrance and sat by the Summerhouse Cafe.

Owen Hill, who is expected to give evidence during the trial, described being lured by the three around the back of the cafe with the suggestion of a sexual encounter with Strickland.

However, sensing something was wrong, he left.

The court was told Dr Jenkins, who was bisexual and became estranged from his wife, moved back to Cardiff from London around six years ago. He was open about his sexuality and regularly went to the park at night ""looking for sexual contact with other men"".

Image: The trio entered the park via the Castle Road entrance and sat by the Summerhouse Cafe, the court was told

Dr Jenkins finished work at around 5pm, went for food in Canton, a city neighbourhood, and then drinks in the city centre before going to the park, Mr Enoch said

The jury was shown images of a bloodied and bruised Dr Jenkins, taken while he lay in intensive care after the assault.

All three defendants have accepted being present during the attack and pleaded guilty to the manslaughter and robbery of Dr Jenkins and the assault of Mr Williams.

'Insult to our intelligence'

Strickland's defence team is expected to argue for diminished responsibility due to him being intoxicated at the time, while Edwards and the girl are to claim they didn't mean to seriously harm Dr Jenkins, the court was told.

The girl told police officers that she participated in the attack out of fear of the two men, a claim Mr Enoch called ""an insult to our intelligence"".

""Not one scintilla of remorse has been shown by these defendants, who left (Dr Jenkins) for dead on his own, in the dark, in the park,"" Mr Enoch added.

""As they punched and kicked the pleading and begging Dr Jenkins over a period of 13 minutes or more, shouting at him and humiliating him, we don't think they intended to give him a black eye or bruise. There can only be one sensible conclusion, we say.""

In an expletive-laden interview, the star of Game of Thrones and Cyrano described the studio's decision as: ""f****** backwards"".

The new version of the 1937 animated film is slated for release in 2023 and is set to star Rachel Zeglar as the princess, with Gal Gadot playing the Evil Queen, according to IMDB.

Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, accused the studio of double standards by championing racial diversity but failing to address damaging stereotypes.

""There's a lot of hypocrisy going on I've got to say,"" the Emmy winner told Marc Maron's WTF podcast.

""No offence to anything but I was a little taken aback by [the fact that] they were very proud to cast a Latino actress as Snow White, but you're still telling the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

""They were so proud of that, and all love and respect to the actress and the people who thought they were doing the right thing but I'm just, like, 'what are you doing?'""

He urged the company to rethink the project.

""Take a step back and look at what you're doing there,"" he said. ""It makes no sense to me.""

He continued: ""You can be progressive in one way but you're still making that f****** backwards story of the seven dwarves living in the cave.

""What the f*** are you doing, man. Have I done nothing to advance the cause from my soapbox?

""I guess I'm not loud enough.""

Snow White 'needs to be updated'

CNN quoted him as saying the story can still be told, but it needs to be updated to today's standards.

He said: ""If you tell the story of Snow White with the most f***** up, progressive spin on it? Let's do it. All in.""

The casting of the dwarves has not yet been announced.

Snow White and the Huntsman, an updated version released ten years ago, faced a backlash after the dwarves were played by actors of heights close to the average who were then digitally downsized, according to Insider.

Seinfeld actor Danny Woodburn compared the move to ""blackface"", while Little People of America"" threatened to hold a ""100-midget march"", the news site said.

And speaking in the Commons, the prime minister told MPs: ""I welcome the Met's decision to conduct its own investigation because I believe this will help to give the public the clarity it needs and help to draw a line under matters.""

The Met wrote to the Cabinet Office on Tuesday morning, formally requesting that it refers all relevant information from its inquiry in relation to the events under investigation to support the force's work.

At this stage there is no estimate for how long its investigation will take, although sources have told Sky News it will take ""weeks, not days"".

Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said it's ""quite right"" that Ms Gray and the Met Police are investigating alleged events in Downing Street and Whitehall for potential breaches of coronavirus regulations.

Asked if he wants the report to be published in full and as soon as possible, Mr Raab replied: ""These are all matters for Sue Gray.""

Birthday gathering the latest revelation to emerge

The PM is under pressure following a raft of disclosures surrounding gatherings in Downing Street and a number of government departments during COVID restrictions.

Opposition parties have called on him to resign, with some of his own backbench MPs also demanding Mr Johnson go.

In the latest revelation, Number 10 has admitted the prime minister had a birthday celebration inside Downing Street during the first COVID lockdown in 2020.

Mr Johnson has already admitted attending a garden party in Downing Street in May of that year, which was described by one of his aides as a ""bring your own booze"" event.

But he has claimed he thought it was a ""work event"" and that ""nobody told me"" it was against the rules.

The revelation that officials held two parties in Downing Street the day before the Queen sat alone at Prince Philip's funeral in April last year also provoked fury.

This counterintuitive argument is being pushed by Mr Johnson’s inner circle, who say that since the PM vehemently claims his innocence, and thinks the outcome of the investigation can only fall in his favour, only this full police probe can exonerate him and draw a line under the matter satisfactorily in the eyes of the public.

Over optimistic? Possibly. Desperate? Maybe. But these are unprecedented times.

Live reaction and fallout as police investigation launched - politics latest

A clean bill of health from the Metropolitan Police and Sue Gray inquiry is just one possible outcome of the maelstrom that Mr Johnson finds himself in - almost every other outcome from the probes and inquiries into his behaviour would be worse.

Several of them could end up with him being ousted from office sooner or later. Despite the bravura poise he adopted in the Commons during a statement on Ukraine, this remains a moment of maximum peril for the prime minister.

There are now three main ways Mr Johnson’s premiership could potentially end.

The first is a fatal blow in the Sue Gray report, which may come in the coming hours or days, and opinion in the Conservative Party settling firmly on the idea he must exit Number 10.

The second is the police sanctioning Mr Johnson personally at the conclusion of their investigation, which would also make it hard for Tory MPs to offer their continued support.

The third is that Conservative MPs, who will play a role whatever happens, decide the weight of problems facing the prime minister make him certain to be an electoral drag in future elections.

This does provide a crack through which Mr Johnson could yet climb to reset his premiership, but having lost the confidence of the Scottish party, many of the MPs in the new intake, and some of his party grandees, this is an uphill task.

The Metropolitan Police inquiry into Mr Johnson is likely to take several weeks at least, which elongates the period before Tory MPs can draw a line under the issue. The Sue Gray report is expected much sooner, but the mood in Whitehall has been darkening for days.

For those wondering if things could get worse, there are signs they could.

Sky News understands that Ms Gray has been handed photos of Mr Johnson at an event in Downing Street with wine bottles, which suggest revelry against the spirit and letter of pandemic lockdown law.

It is unknown whether such images will be published in the final report, but two different sources confirm their existence. For some wavering backbenchers that might be problematic enough.

To underline how rapidly things are moving, the discussion among Tory MPs appears to have already moved beyond questions like who might run for leader, and whether Mr Johnson should stay on.

Instead many are already talking about how the change should happen. Should frontrunner Rishi Sunak do a deal with fellow favourite Liz Truss, for instance, to avoid a bruising contest and speed things along? Would guaranteeing her a great office of state in return for not running against him be enough? Would a less obvious candidate serve the party better?

""I'm personally devastated. On a practical level, I've got to earn a living, so that's obviously a stress. I have colleagues that are single parents and they don't know where they're going to get the income to be able to survive,"" she tells me.

She says the decision to be vaccinated or not is an entirely personal one and must not be forced on anyone against their will.

Her stance means she will lose her job even though she has four children and a mortgage.

She says her decision is fully supported by her husband and health worker colleagues, both vaccinated and unvaccinated.

I asked Mrs Thompson if she agrees the vaccines had saved thousands of lives.

She accepts this but adds that individuals should weigh up the personal risk involved and then make an informed opinion.

Mrs Thompson says she has a history of myocarditis and this is one of the reasons she chose not to get vaccinated, in case there is an elevated risk to her health.

I tell Mrs Thompson that the government, backed by data from their own scientists, insists on vaccines for all NHS staff as it reduces transmission and protects patients.

She says she has not seen enough evidence to convince her that is true.

Conservative Huw Merriman, who is chairman of the Transport Select Committee, told MPs it was a ""blackhole of consumer legislation which needs a fix"".

It's one of the proposals in the Bexhill and Battle MP's Consumer Protection (Double Charging) Bill.

Mr Merriman said a typical beneficiary would be ""the driver who parks their car on a local authority car park, puts their annual season ticket on the dashboard, they close the door, and the ticket slips down and is not displayed correctly"".

He added: ""Despite being able to prove that they have a season ticket registered to their car, they have not displayed the pass and it is this which delivers them a £60 fine.""

The soldier's telephone rang and he was given new orders, turning us around, then taking a sharp right down another track where a car was waiting for us.

As we appeared in his rear-view mirror the driver in the non-descript car moved off, and the soldier was told to follow.

""I've never been here before, I've no idea where we are headed,"" he explained.

We had already been told we couldn't film anything that could identify our location. No signposts, no distinguishing countryside, not even electricity pylons.

We were being taken to a top-secret base in the middle of nowhere - a camp inside a wood in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.

For the first time, a news organisation had been granted permission to visit one of the most important locations to the Ukrainian military right now.

We pulled up and then trudged through the snow to what appeared to be a series of wooden shacks hidden in the forest, smoke rising from thin tin chimneys.

Ukraine's best defence against Russia

An armed soldier standing on the inside of a locked and strangely intricate metal garden gate told us to wait and then radioed inside.

A few minutes later we were allowed in to be greeted by senior officers.

Inside the camp, soldiers were drawing up into units and being given instructions by officers.

We were then escorted through the base to an area where a series of sloping bunkers, covered in branches of cut down trees, dipped into the ground.

Peeking out of the branches was the enormous barrel of a tank.

This base, which stretches for miles through the forest, is the Ukrainian military's best hope of defence against a Russian invasion: a tank battalion on standby to fight.

Soon after our arrival, soldiers started removing the branches and the tank engines roared into life.

One by one they were gunned out of their snow-covered bunkers and, in a cacophony of sound and spraying mud, made their way to an open plain.

Image: Maxim Nazarenko, one of the Tank Troop Commanders, said Ukraine is preparing for all possibilities

As the tension continues to grow over a potential Russian invasion, the tank crews are undergoing intense training and inspection.

The tanks are usually concealed in miles of snowy forest.

The crews here are working on evasion tactics knowing that they'll likely be outgunned by the Russian forces' more sophisticated equipment, and more importantly its sheer numbers.

These tanks, all modified in the city of Kharkiv here in the east, are widely regarded as better than the ones used by the Russians. And the Ukrainian military has been taking delivery of as many as they can get since the separatist uprising in Donetsk and the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Maxim Nazarenko, one of the Tank Troop Commanders here, told me they're preparing for all possibilities.

""Our training has intensified. Troops are being strengthened, supervision of equipment is being strengthened, everything comes down to that. Personnel are being trained; equipment is being prepared. Everyone is in enhanced mode, in standby mode.""

Ukraine ready despite 'concerns'

He told me they're aware of the realities of facing up to the Russian Army, but that they're ready, and determined to ""give them a proper answer"" if their territory is compromised.

""There are always concerns, even in times when there is no war. And, of course, there are concerns now as well. But in order to reduce it, we fulfil different standards, prepare, and improve our skills to fight the enemy.""

We watch on as the tanks carve up the earth, manoeuvring from their hideouts through mud, ice and snow. It's pretty much frozen here already - both armies could easily find themselves easily bogged down.

The US referred to supporting this NATO Response Force, or NRF, when it put 8,500 troops on ""heightened alert"" to deploy to Europe as tensions escalate with Russia and the potential for a new invasion of Ukraine looms large.

There is no plan to send NATO forces into Ukraine in the event of a Russian attack as the country is not a member state.

But the alliance has made clear it would bolster NATO's eastern and southeastern flank with more troops to shore up its own defences.

The NRF draws on servicemen and women from across the 30-country NATO alliance.

Units slot into a land, air, sea or special operations role for a 12-month period during which time they are the first responders in an emergency - from a military threat to a natural disaster.

The North Atlantic Council - the main political decision-making body of the alliance - can decide to activate the force. For example if recommended to do so by NATO's top military commander, US General Tod Wolters.

The NRF has never been mobilised to respond to a Russian threat - yet.

At the sharpest end of the NRF is a ""spearhead force"" of some 20,000 military personnel - including a 5,000-strong land brigade.

They are at the very highest level of readiness to fight.

For land forces, that usually means seven days' notice to move, though that mobilisation time has been cut to five days because of tensions with Russia - and even down to 48 hours for some elements.

France leads the high-readiness land brigade this year, having taken over from a Turkish unit.

It is due to handover to a German brigade in 2023 - an example of how roles rotate. It was the UK's turn in 2017.

There are also warplanes, warships and special operations forces across the alliance on short notice to mobilise, comprising some 15,000 servicemen and women in total.

The Royal Navy's HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carrier took over command of the maritime arm of the high-readiness force at the start of the year on the flagship's maiden deployment.

With land, sea and air combined, the so-called Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, or VJTF, was created by allies to bolster defences after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 - a move that caught NATO off guard and triggered a significant overhaul of its defence policy.

The NATO Response Force also comprises another 20,000 military personnel in a follow-on role and ready to mobilise if a crisis lasts beyond a few days or weeks.

They are in turn split between 10,000 troops on notice to move within 30 days, and the others ready in 45 days.

Explainer: What's happening with Russia and Ukraine?

What do satellite images reveal about Russian bases?

As well as the emergency troops, NATO already has forces operating across its eastern and southeastern flanks in deployments on land, at sea and in the air to deter Russian aggression.

A high-profile part of this are four battle groups - each with about 1,000 soldiers - based in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and also in Poland.

The so-called Enhanced Forward Presence was established in 2016 as a direct response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and backing of separatists in the east of Ukraine from 2014.

The UK heads the Estonia battlegroup, Latvia has Canada, Germany is in the lead in Lithuania, and the US heads the battle group in Poland.

NATO has signalled it is ready to increase its presence along its eastern and southeastern borders should President Putin decide to launch a new invasion of Ukraine.

Boris Johnson has revealed that British forces would contribute to any new NATO deployments but did not say how many personnel are being considered.

The high-readiness troops and NATO deployments across Europe are designed to respond to an emergency or to deter threats.

However, they are not the only forces that allies would turn to in the event of a military attack against a member state.

Such an offensive would likely prompt allies to invoke Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty, which states than that an attack against one is an attack on all.

This would enable the alliance to draw on the individual militaries of each country - a total strength of some 3.5 million military personnel.

But that level of force would only really ever be called upon at a moment of existential peril on the level of a third world war.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220125230816/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-how-many-nato-troops-are-ready-if-russia-launches-new-invasion-12525392;

The latest results from the REACT-1 study, which is based on around 100,000 random tests across England, show that the infection rate in primary school-age children was 7.8% - and rising - during the study period of 5 to 20 January.

By contrast infection rates in adults were far lower and falling, with people over 75 least likely to have COVID at 2.4%.

Opposing trends in the old and young

The opposing trends meant that across the population infections decreased at first but have since begun to level off at what is still a high rate.

Professor Christl Donnelly from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling at Oxford University, and one of the researchers, said it's unclear how long infection rates will continue rising in children.

""As someone with a child who goes to school, that is a potential risk factor for the rest of the family.

""But there has already been a lot of transmission among adults and a lot of vaccination as well.

""So we will see (high infection rates) played out in children and then potentially people who come into contact with them having a risk as well.""

Christmas break delayed Omicron surge in children

The researchers say children were more likely to be infected with Delta than Omicron before Christmas. But the new variant has now spread to all age groups.

Prof Donnelly said the festive break disrupted normal behaviour patterns, with adults who had been working from home having more social contacts, but children having fewer because they weren't at school.

How accurate is the data?

The decrease in cases followed by a more recent levelling off - much like a hockey stick - mirrors the trend in daily reported cases on the government dashboard.

Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and US troops attempted to storm the Gweiran prison, in the city of Hassakeh, after it was seized by militants last Thursday.

Around 850 children are thought to have been caught up in the clashes, which have lasted six days, UNICEF said.

More than 220 people have been killed and around 550 militants have surrendered so far, according to the SDF.

The fighting has also forced over 45,000 civilians, mostly women and children, to flee from their homes.

""These families fled in such a hurry with almost nothing on them in harsh winter weather. Many have already been displaced and fled violence from other parts of Syria,"" Ms Touma added.

Dozens of inmates escape while others take over prison

Dozens of IS inmates managed to escape during the attack, which has seen a car bomb detonated and vehicles used to ram through the prison walls.

Other prisoners have taken over part of the facility and some are still holed up in nearby buildings.

The UN's children's agency said fighting must end immediately so the children, some of which are as young as 12, can leave safely.

They were all detained during the US-backed campaigns that drove IS from its last territorial enclave in Syria back in 2019.

A new study found the likely extent of aortic stenosis within Britain exceeds the NHS's capacity to treat.

Aortic Stenosis is when the main valve taking blood from the heart stiffens or narrows.

Many who have the issue are only diagnosed when it is too late for treatment.

If it is caught early, the condition can be monitored by doctors. Surgery, including replacing the aortic valve in an open heart procedure, can be necessary.

An international study with experts from the universities of Glasgow and Southampton, was started to establish the extent of the disease in the UK.

The report was published in the journal Open Heart, and estimated in 2019 that 291,448 men and women aged 55 and over had severe aortic stenosis.

Of this, 68% had symptoms - meaning 92,389 did not show signs of the potentially fatal condition.

According to the NHS, symptoms include: chest pain or a feeling of pressure/tightening in the chest, spreading out to arms, shoulders, neck and stomach; breathlessness during moderate to strenuous activity; and blackouts during exertion when the heart is working hard.

The authors went on to predict that 59% of people with aortic stenosis will ""die within five years without proactive management"".

They added the disease is a ""common condition"" in the UK, and warned ""without appropriate detection and intervention, survival prospects are likely to be poor"".

Roughly 20,000 new patients would benefit from treatment each year - but the researchers said this is ""discordant with current capacity within the NHS"".

On Tuesday afternoon, it was understood that Number 10 would publish the report compiled by the senior civil servant around midday today and then the PM would make a statement in the Commons after PMQs.

But it is now believed the document will not be released for publication until later this afternoon at the earliest, with the chances of this being delayed until Thursday growing.

The prime minister has vowed to make a statement and answer questions in the House of Commons after the Gray report has been made public.

Opposition parties had voiced concern on Tuesday that, if published today, they would not be given sufficient time to read the document before any potential statement from the PM later in the day.

But uncertainty has been cast over its publication as Ms Gray's team hold discussions with the Metropolitan Police after they announced a criminal investigation into allegations of lockdown-breaching parties in Downing Street.

Met Police launch criminal investigation into Downing Street parties

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick announced the force was investigating ""a number of events"" for potential breaches of COVID-19 regulations at a meeting of the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee.

Speaking in the Commons yesterday, Mr Johnson said he welcomed the police probe, saying he believed it would ""help draw a line under matters"".

The Met wrote to the Cabinet Office formally requesting that it refers all relevant information from its inquiry in relation to the events under investigation to support the force's work.

At this stage there is no estimate for how long its investigation will take, although sources have told Sky News it will take ""weeks, not days"".

Sky News understands the Met has not raised an objection to the Cabinet Office inquiry being released before its criminal investigation has concluded.

Labour call for publication of Gray report 'in full'

Number 10 has so far held back from confirming the report will be published in full, with ministers committing only to releasing the ""full findings"".

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said anything less than a full publication of the report would amount to a ""cover-up"".

Downing Street reiterated on Tuesday afternoon that the government wants the report to be published ""as soon as possible"" and insisted Number 10 is not trying to block its publication.

The prime minister's official spokesperson told reporters talks are taking place between Ms Gray's inquiry team and the Metropolitan Police to decide what can be published from her investigation into the 'partygate' row.

Ms Gray's report is likely to provide a factual account of what happened at a number of alleged parties, and may present a judgement on whether the events breached rules in place at the time.

Johnson's leadership under severe pressure

Mr Johnson's leadership is under severe pressure amid the ongoing 'partygate' scandal and could be put to a vote if more than 54 Conservative MPs submit letters of no confidence to the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs.

It is thought the next few days will be pivotal for the prime minister as he and his officials remain braced for the document's release.

The Telegraph reported that Mr Johnson spent time meeting with 15 Conservative MPs individually in his office on Tuesday evening as he sought to build support ahead of the Gray report's publication.

Meanwhile, the discussion among Conservative MPs appears to have already moved beyond questions like who might run for leader, and whether Mr Johnson should stay on.

PM facing growing calls to resign

Earlier this month, the PM issued an apology in the House of Commons for attending an event in the Number 10 garden on 20 May 2020, claiming he thought it was a ""work event"", and asked people to wait for Ms Gray to publish her findings.

Opposition parties and some critics on his own backbenches say any evidence he has misled parliament would amount to a breach of the ministerial code and require the prime minister's resignation.

And yesterday evening, it was understood that Ms Gray had received photographs showing Mr Johnson and others close together with wine bottles when COVID rules were in place as part of her investigation.

It is unknown whether such images will be published in the final report, but two different sources confirm their existence.

Speaking to reporters, Sir Keir said cabinet ministers ""need to look themselves in the mirror and ask themselves why they're still supporting this PM"" following the announcement of a Met police probe into Downing Street parties.

The latest reports of a coronavirus rule break came less than 24 hours after Number 10 admitted the prime minister had a birthday celebration there during the first COVID lockdown in 2020.

The revelation that officials held two parties in Downing Street the day before the Queen sat alone at Prince Philip's funeral in April last year also provoked fury.

A total of 155 plants, 16 fish species, 17 amphibians, 35 reptiles, and one mammal have been found in the Greater Mekong region of southeast Asia, conservation charity WWF has said.

The discoveries showed the area, which spans Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, is rich in wildlife diversity but also highlighted the need to protect species and habitats from being lost, the organisation added.

Among the unusual finds was a Popa langur monkey, which is expected to be listed as critically endangered.

About 200 to 250 of the langurs are thought to be living in the wild in four isolated locations and are threatened by hunting, habitat loss, agriculture, and timber extraction.

The first evidence of the primates' existence was collected from specimens more than a century ago, which are now featured at London's Natural History Museum.

What other species were found?

An orange-brown knobbly newt with a racing stripe down its back, which was first spotted in a 20-year-old photo, was found in Thailand, along with an orange and grey rock gecko.

In Vietnam and Cambodia, a big-headed frog was found and in Burma, a colourless cave-dwelling fish was discovered.

The word's first succulent bamboo, whose stem can inflate and deflate during the dry and wet seasons, was also among the newly-found species after being identified in Laos.

A plant with a pungent odour from the ginger family that was first found in a shop in eastern Thailand, a mulberry tree from Vietnam, and a series of begonias from Laos and Burma have also been described as new species.

""They require out greatest respect""

Regional wildlife lead at WWF-Greater Mekong, Dr Yoganand Kandasamy, said more than 3,000 species have been spotted in the area in the past 24 years.

She added: ""The Greater Mekong region is no doubt a world heavyweight contender for species discoveries.

""These species are extraordinary, beautiful products of millions of years of evolution, but are under intense threat, with many species going extinct even before they are described.

""They require our greatest respect, utmost attention, and urgent actions to protect their habitats and minimise exploitation.""

WWF-UK's director of science Mark Wright urged governments, who will meet for the UN global biodiversity summit later this year, to commit to halting and reversing the destruction of nature by 2030.

He added that the new findings show the ""extraordinary diversity and inventiveness of nature"" but also serve as a ""timely reminder of the extreme jeopardy that so many of these species and habitats face.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126050825/http://news.sky.com/story/more-than-220-new-animal-and-plant-species-discovered-in-greater-mekong-wwf-says-12525571;

The temporary order, that demands the 45-year-old woman stop harassing, stalking, and contacting the tech firm's chief executive, was issued by a court on Friday.

In a petition for the order, Apple said the Virginia woman started harassing Mr Cook in October 2020 when she tweeted that they were married and he was the father of her twin children.

She is also accused of emailing Mr Cook 200 times in the space of a month, with messages showing a ""significant escalation in tone"" and becoming ""threatening and highly disturbing"", NBC reported, citing the petition.

In one message, the mum allegedly send a photo of a loaded handgun and in another, she said she would never forgive or forget Mr Cook.

Apple claimed she set up dozens of companies in his name across California, New York, and Virginia, including one with ""Safe Sexclinic, Cook HIV"" in its name.

In September last year, the petition suggests the woman sent an email to Mr Cook that said she was applying to be his roommate in Palo Alto.

Once officers arrived, she supposedly told them she was staying locally and ""could get violent"".

The woman allegedly continued emailing and tweeting at Mr Cook, asking in a December message for $500 million cash and saying in a January tweet that he would be ""suicided in his condo.""

Those roles have made him a two-time best actor Oscar winner, with three other nominations - for Dead Man Walking, Sweet And Lowdown and I Am Sam - also under his belt, as well as praise for his work behind the camera on films such as Into The Wild.

Penn has also made headlines outside his performances; his marriage to Madonna in 1985 made them one of the most famous couples in the world at the time, and he is also a star who has never been afraid to speak his mind on political issues or use his platform to highlight causes he believes in.

So with the 61-year-old's children, daughter Dylan and son Hopper, following in his footsteps, it is no surprise they would turn to him for advice on how to navigate the industry. His latest project, Flag Day, not only sees Penn both acting and directing for the first time, but also starring alongside his children.

Based on the true story of US journalist Jennifer Vogel's account of her life with her father, the notorious conman, counterfeiter and bank-robber John Vogel, the film follows the pair over 20 years.

Dylan, 30, whose mother is actress Robin Wright (Forrest Gump, House Of Cards), grew up in northern California, away from Hollywood, and never set out to follow her famous parents into acting. She is a successful model and had ambitions of working in the industry but behind the camera. However, Sean says he always envisioned her playing the part of Jennifer Vogel.

Having encouraged her and Hopper, who plays Jennifer's brother Nick Vogel, the star tells Sky News the industry is very different to the one he started out in in the early 1980s, and shares his advice for his children.

""The business I knew is not the business of today,"" he says. ""Especially with the lingering effects of the COVID pandemic, you know, on every level of the business or the creative filmmaking, one wonders what the future is going to be.

""With the injection of streaming, the convenience, capability of seeing films at home theatres and so on - which would not have been my guidance... I'm still a guy who fell in love with the girl whose name is cinema in a movie theatre in the dark with strangers. I think the kinds of stories that interest me are the ones that want to be experienced in that way.""

Image: Dylan plays Jennifer Vogel, who wrote the memoir the film is based on. Pic: Vertigo Releasing

In 2022, there is an ""extraordinary amount of content"", he says, likening today's culture of streaming to a huge bookstore where people don't cross paths. ""It seems to be a less unifying experience for culture and society at any given time than it was when I fell in love with it.""

However, he continues: ""That said, there is [also] some of the most extraordinary writing, acting, directing. The good things are really kind of miraculously good - though built to addict; this is not taking a couple of hours of our volunteered time to go in and have a cultural experience, this is something that's meant to grab us and hold us as long as it can.

""For actors getting involved in the world today, you're talking about very prestigious things in terms of how the business is perceived, which is to get a part in a series. Well, that part in a series might mean you're not going to do any other parts for six years.

""The actor's career, I would find it very treacherous were I starting today... I think all of the things, from the audition process to the selectivity to the competition, I think it's all on a much higher level than it was. So I worry, given that I have been encouraging to both of my kids... there's a part of me that just hopes that they've got their laser focus on the path through that all that interests them and is of value to them, so that they don't get distracted by all the noise of too big a library.""

Flag Day, which also stars Katheryn Winnick, Josh Brolin and Regina King, presents an intimate portrait of a young woman who struggles to rise above the wreckage of her past - while reconciling the inescapable bond she has with her father.

It might be her first major role, but Dylan's performance will certainly silence any critics who might question why she got the part.

She read Jennifer Vogel's book as a teenager, but never felt ready to take on the role until now. While Vogel clearly had a very complex relationship with her father, Dylan says she was able to see similarities with her own circumstances.

""It's a very complicated relationship between Jennifer and her father, and I think I can relate to that,"" she says. ""But [it's] also very different in the way that my dad and I are very transparent with each other, whereas Jennifer was always striving to have that with her father but wasn't given that in return.

""I think in terms of life experience, I do feel like there's a parallel with me and Jennifer in terms of trying to find your authentic self and kind of identifying yourself as separate from your family. I think that that rang true for me.""

As a child of two very famous parents, Dylan says she has always been conscious of forging her own path.

""If people know who my parents are before I walk into room, there's a perception that's preconceived,"" she says. ""So I think I felt a little disabled by that at times and felt insecure before walking into a room or going to a new school or starting a new job.

""Then as I got older, [I realised] that's just a part of who I am. I am separate, I am an individual, but that's always going to be a part of my identity.""

Sarah Moulds was sacked from her position at the Mowbray Education Trust in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, last month after the footage was shared online.

It showed a woman repeatedly slapping the animal after it ran into a road.

The video was investigated by the RSPCA after anti-hunting activists, the Hertfordshire Hunt Saboteurs, posted it on Twitter.

Animal lover Ricky Gervais retweeted the video to his 14 million followers, while TV presenter and conservationist Chris Packham also shared it.

At the time, the RSPCA described it as ""really upsetting"" and urged anyone with information to come forward.

Now, the organisation has confirmed a prosecution case has been brought against Ms Moulds and she is due to appear in Boston Magistrates' Court on Monday.

In a statement, a spokesperson from the organisation said the 37-year-old has been accused of two offences under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 against a grey pony named Bruce.

The charity is expected to allege Ms Moulds caused Bruce ""unnecessary suffering"" by ""kicking and hitting him, and for not taking reasonable steps to ""protect the animal from pain, suffering, injury or disease"".

Both of the alleged offences occurred in November while Ms Moulds was taking part in one of Britain's oldest foxhound packs - The Cottesmore Hunt.

After a public outcry following the release of the video, she was suspended and then sacked by Mowbray Education Trust.

She was also removed from a voluntary position at her local branch at the pony club.

The western lowland silverback was found dead by his ""heartbroken"" care team at Zoo Atlanta in Georgia, US, on Tuesday morning.

Ozzie's cause of death is unknown, but he is said to have lost his appetite since last week and was being provided with supportive care to encourage him to eat and drink.

But over the last 24 hours he had been treated for facial swelling, weakness and an inability to eat or drink, the zoo said.

Raymond B King, the zoo's president and chief executive, said: ""This is a devastating loss for Zoo Atlanta. While we knew this time would come someday, that inevitability does nothing to stem the deep sadness we feel at losing a legend.

""Ozzie's life's contributions are indelible, in the generations of individuals he leaves behind in the gorilla population and in the world's body of knowledge in the care of his species.

""Our thoughts are with his care team, who have lost a part of their lives and a part of their hearts.""

Last year, Ozzie was one of 13 gorillas at Zoo Atlanta who tested positive for COVID-19.

Officials said they believed the apes contracted it from a fully vaccinated zoo worker who was wearing protective equipment. The worker was asymptomatic.

The zoo said it would release the results of Ozzie's post-mortem after it is completed by the University of Georgia's veterinary college.

Ozzie was the only surviving member of the original generation of gorillas who arrived at Zoo Atlanta with the opening of its Ford African Rain Forest in 1988.

COVID among children and teenagers is keeping infection levels high, according to a new study.

Infections of the virus have slowed down in England recently, but the highest prevalence was in primary school children at 7.81% between 5 and 20 January this year, while overall it was 4.41%.

This means that during this period one in 23 people in England was infected with Covid.

Professor Elliott, director of the React programme from Imperial's School of Public Health, said: ""There is good news in our data in that infections had been rapidly dropping during January, but they are still extremely high and may have recently stalled at a very high prevalence.

""Of particular concern is that there is rapidly increasing prevalence among children now they are mixing more following the start of the school term and, compared with December, prevalence in older people aged 65-plus has increased seven- to 12-fold, which may lead to increased hospitalisations.

""It's therefore vital that we continue to monitor the situation closely to understand the impact of the Omicron variant, which now makes up almost all infections in the country.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126100851/http://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-news-latest-live-updates-new-covid-variant-could-prolong-current-wave-uk-reports-highest-daily-deaths-for-11-months-12507015;

Over recent months, as reports of alleged rule-breaking parties have emerged, several political officials and civil servants have been named in association with events in Downing Street and Whitehall.

While it is not known how much detail will be included in Sue Gray's findings, the report could identify failings in how Number 10 was run and lead to sackings or resignations from the prime minister's senior team.

Dan Rosenfield

Mr Rosenfield was appointed Downing Street's chief of staff in January 2021, following the resignations of the PM's key aides Lee Cain and Dominic Cummings, and the departure of his long-time strategic adviser Sir Edward Lister.

According to a report in The Times, Mr Rosenfield may have attended a Christmas quiz in December 2020, as a chance to meet other staff before formally starting his role. Downing Street denied the allegations.

Image: Dan Rosenfield was private secretary to former chancellors Alistair Darling and George Osborne

Conservative MPs have been critical, claiming he does not understand the parliamentary party, and have urged Boris Johnson to replace him.

Mr Rosenfield was private secretary to former chancellors Alistair Darling and George Osborne, but had worked as a consultant in the private sector before taking up his current role.

Simon Case

Cabinet Secretary Simon Case has been the country's most senior civil servant since he was appointed to the role in 2020.

Image: Cabinet Secretary Simon Case was initially responsible for the investigation into the partygate events

He was initially responsible for the investigation into the partygate events but was forced to recuse himself after admitting an event had taken place outside his own office in December 2020.

A Cabinet Office said Mr Case had ""played no part in the event"" but had walked through the office in which it took place on the way to his own.

Ed Oldfield

Downing Street's 23-year-old head of broadcast media was brought into the partygate scandal when he was heard joking about a Number 10 party in a leaked video obtained by ITV.

In the video which led to fellow adviser Allegra Stratton's resignation, Mr Oldfield could be heard asking Ms Stratton questions as she prepared for daily Number 10 briefings which were eventually scrapped.

Image: Ed Oldfield, 23, could be heard on the video which led to Allegra Stratton's resignation

Mr Oldfield asks: ""I've just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night, do you recognise those reports?""

Ms Stratton replies: ""I went home"", before Mr Oldfield presses further, asking: ""Would the prime minister condone having a Christmas party?""

Mr Oldfield remained in post, despite the PM ordering an investigation into the alleged Number 10 parties, with Downing Street saying at the time that the head of broadcast was not under any probe.

Shelley Williams-Walker

Another senior aide, the prime minister's head of operations was allegedly nicknamed 'DJ SWW' after playing tunes from a laptop on a photocopier in the basement at a Number 10 party on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral.

According to initial reports in The Telegraph, on 16 April 2021 Downing Street staff had a boozy party where one individual was sent to the shop to fill a suitcase of wine and another broke the prime minister's son's swing.

On the roof of Number 10, the flag was at half-mast ahead of Prince Philip's funeral - an event which saw the Queen sitting alone due to lockdown rules.

There are said to have been two parties on this date which later merged - marking the departure of a photographer and the PM's former official spokesperson James Slack.

Ms Williams-Walker worked with Mr Johnson when he was foreign secretary, subsequently becoming part of his leadership campaign team and then joining him in Number 10.

She is also known as the aide in the viral video confiscating a disposable cup from the PM during the general election campaign after it was handed to him by then fellow special adviser Rob Oxley.

Martin Reynolds

The prime minister's principal private secretary was thrust into the spotlight as the man behind the notorious ""bring your own booze"" email sent to Downing Street staff, inviting them to ""socially distanced drinks"" in the Number 10 garden on 20 May 2020.

The leaked email, seen by ITV News, placed Mr Reynolds - who was appointed to his role in October 2019 - firmly at the centre of the Downing Street partygate row.

The same month, according to an initial report by the Guardian, Mr Reynolds was seen in the Downing Street garden alongside the PM and several other staff at a time when the guidance said people could only meet one person who they did not live with outdoors.

On 11 January, a Number 10 spokesperson said that the PM had ""full confidence"" in Mr Reynolds and that he will continue in his role despite calls to resign.

As the PM's principal private secretary, Mr Reynolds is a prominent adviser to the PM and leads operations inside Number 10.

He previously worked his way up the Foreign Office ranks to become principal private secretary to the foreign secretary, a role which he held when Mr Johnson headed the department as foreign secretary from 2016 to 2018.

Stuart Glassborow

The prime minister's deputy principal private secretary is said to be in line to leave Number 10 alongside Mr Reynolds, according to some reports.

A plan, reportedly referred to by the PM as 'Operation Save Big Dog', is expected to see a clear out of some key officials from Number 10 following the publication of Sue Gray's investigation.

Mr Glassborow was principal private secretary to the Treasury before taking up the deputy PPS position in Number 10 in May 2019.

Jack Doyle

The former Daily Mail journalist was appointed director of communications in April 2021, replacing Mr Slack who quit to become deputy editor-in-chief at The Sun newspaper.

Mr Doyle is alleged to have attended a Downing Street party on 18 December, addressing staff members who were at the event and giving out awards.

ITV News claimed there were 50 people at the gathering.

Akram, from Blackburn, held four people hostage during the incident, but they were released unharmed.

Last week, it emerged that Akram arrived in the US at Kennedy Airport in New York on 29 December and was questioned by customs officials, but as there were no red flags in the system he was allowed to enter the country, according to NBC.

He had told family members he wanted to get married and was going to go to Texas to find a Mexican bride.

After two days he asked relatives in Britain for more money to get to Texas and took a flight to Dallas Fort Worth on New Years' Eve, the broadcaster said.

He stayed in homeless shelters in the Dallas area in the days before the attack on Saturday, and is understood to have purchased a gun on the streets which had been stolen in 2020.

Akram demanded release of al Qaeda suspect

During the standoff with police in Colleyville, Akram demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist who is suspected of having ties to al Qaeda and was convicted of trying to kill US troops in Afghanistan.

The prison where Siddiqui is serving her sentence is in nearby Fort Worth.

Dinklage, who is best known for playing Tyrion Lannister in the epic fantasy series and who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia himself, accused the studio of double standards by championing racial diversity, but failing to address damaging stereotypes.

Latina actress Rachel Zegler will play the princess in the live-action remake of the 1937 animated film, while Israeli star Gal Gadot will portray the Evil Queen.

Responding to the actor, Disney said it is ""consulting with members of the dwarfism community"" on the film, adding: ""To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters.

""We look forward to sharing more as the film heads into production after a lengthy development period.""

Previously speaking on Marc Maron's WTF podcast, Dinklage said: ""There's a lot of hypocrisy going on I've got to say.

""No offence to anything but I was a little taken aback by [the fact that] they were very proud to cast a Latino actress as Snow White, but you're still telling the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

""They were so proud of that, and all love and respect to the actress and the people who thought they were doing the right thing but I'm just, like, 'what are you doing?'""

He urged the company to rethink the project.

The Beijing Olympics, which start on 4 February, will be the first Winter Games to use almost 100% artificial snow, relying on more than 100 snow generators and 300 snow-cannons working flat-out to cover the ski slopes.

""This is not only energy and water intensive, frequently using chemicals to slow melt, but also delivers a surface that many competitors say is unpredictable and potentially dangerous,"" said the Slippery Slopes report, produced by researchers at Loughborough University and the Protect Our Winters environment group.

Scottish freestyle skier Laura Donaldson warned that if ""freestyle super pipes are formed from snow-making machines in a poor [natural snow] season, the walls of the pipe are solid, vertical ice and the pipe floor is solid ice"".

""This is dangerous for athletes,"" she added.

The fears about conditions echo those expressed during last summer's Tokyo Olympics, when athletes fainted and collapsed due to heat in a city that is on average 2.86C hotter than in 1900.

Image: Half pipes are more dangerous when made from artificial snow, athletes have warned

'Unfortunate truth'

""The risk is clear: manmade warming is threatening the long-term future of winter sports,"" the report warned, citing further studies. It added that global heating is also ""reducing the number of climatically suitable host venues for the Winter Olympiad"".

It said the snowy slopes outside Beijing mask ""an unfortunate truth: they will be the result of an estimated 49 million gallons of chemically-treated water frozen through snow machines"".

The Beijing organising committee has issued a sustainability report saying the Games' ""smart snowmaking system"" could use 20% less water than traditional methods.

Earlier this week Beijing said Chinese authorities would tackle polluters to ensure the Games would be held in a ""good environment"", as particularly heavy smog clogged up the capital.

Of the 21 venues used for the Winter Games since the French resort of Chamonix hosted the first in 1924, researchers estimate that, by 2050, only 10 will have the ""climate suitability"" and natural snowfall levels to host an event.

Chamonix is now rated ""high risk"" along with venues in Norway, France and Austria, while Vancouver in Canada, Sochi in Russia and Squaw Valley in the United States are deemed ""unreliable"".

The four remaining members of Rakuda announced in December they will take a hiatus from the music scene, with a view to possibly reforming later this year.

Before Ackland was produced from the cells, Judge Robert Linford had warned those sitting in the public gallery to remain quiet or they would be removed.

He said: ""These cases are understandably fraught with emotion and feelings running high and that is to be expected, but this is a court of law and these proceedings must be conducted with that fact well in mind.""

Ray Tully QC, defending, had applied for Ackland not to be arraigned as he was waiting on the outcome of further psychiatric assessments.

A further case management hearing will take place on a date to be fixed and Ackland, of Radcliffe Close, Southway, Plymouth, was remanded in custody.

Mr Justice Garnham will preside over the trial, which will begin on 3 May and last up to 10 days.

Before adjourning proceedings, Judge Linford thanked the members of the public for ""conducting themselves in a quiet and orderly way"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126150924/http://news.sky.com/story/bobbi-anne-mcleod-musician-cody-ackland-accused-of-murdering-teen-to-face-trial-later-this-year-12525793;
1765;1765;Carer who suffocated suspected thief during citizen's arrest cleared of manslaughter;Wednesday 26 January 2022 13:57, UK;[];['bristol'];['manslaughter', 'suffocated', 'mr', 'victim', 'told', 'citizens', 'cleared', 'wiltshire', 'carer', 'court', 'minutes', 'restraint', 'wanted', 'suspected', 'smith', 'thief', 'arrest'];"A man who suffocated a suspected burglar while performing a citizen's arrest in the street has been cleared of manslaughter.

Nathan Smith, a 38-year-old carer, knelt on Craig Wiltshire's back for nine minutes in the early hours of 20 November 2019 after tackling him to the ground.

He refused to ease off when the victim, 43, told him he could not breathe twice, telling him ""I don't give a s*** what you can and can't do"".

Mr Wiltshire died in hospital two weeks later.

On Wednesday, a jury at Bristol Crown Court cleared Smith of manslaughter after four hours and seven minutes of deliberations.

Smith said he believed Mr Wiltshire was ""pretending"" to be in distress so that he would be released and could escape, and denied any wrongdoing.

Mr Wiltshire was suspected of being behind a string of thefts and break-ins in the Bristol suburb where Smith was working as a live-in carer.

However, there was no active police investigation into the crimes despite repeated complaints to the police, so the thief was never caught.

Victim had pre-existing heart condition

A post-mortem revealed that Mr Wiltshire had the sedative diazepam and the heroin-substitute methadone in his system, as well as a pre-existing heart condition.

Smith said he was unaware that the victim was vulnerable to cardiorespiratory arrest, and that he did not know leaving someone in the prone position for a prolonged period of time was dangerous.

During the trial, the prosecution argued that Smith took the opportunity to punish Mr Wiltshire for his alleged crimes because he was angry.

Prosecutor James Ward said Smith hurled abusive insults at the victim including calling him a ""f****** piece of shit"" as proof he wanted to hurt him.

Smith said in response: ""I was being loud so other people would come, I didn't want to shout 'help' so he knew I needed help, and I wanted to make him think I was more in control than I was.""

He denied being angry or wanting to punish Mr Wiltshire, adding: ""I just wanted the police to come and get him.""

Smith also told the court he feared Mr Wiltshire had a weapon on him because he had been reaching for his pockets.

Method of restraint not 'inappropriate'

Professor Jason Payne-James, expert in forensic and legal medicine, told the court he did not believe Smith's method of restraint, as a member of the public with no training, was inappropriate.

He added: ""In terms of the persistence of the prone restraint, I believe that would have been inappropriate if police personnel had continued that for that length of time without moving or monitoring (Mr Wiltshire).""

Jurors also heard from a neighbour in the area, Kimberly Lock, who said the community had been ""terrorised"" by the break-ins, adding she had extra locks fitted to her house, including a sliding bolt to her bedroom.

CCTV footage also captured Smith's employer Michael Crooks adding his weight to Mr Wiltshire for a few minutes, while his son Ben Crooks is seen kicking him twice.

Both have admitted a charge of common assault and were not charged with manslaughter.

The jury was told to assume that Mr Wiltshire was the man suspected of committing burglaries in the community over the previous weeks, and that the arrest was not a case of mistaken identity.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126150924/http://news.sky.com/story/carer-who-suffocated-suspected-thief-during-citizens-arrest-cleared-of-manslaughter-12525767;

Nearly a third (29%) thought that the Russian government reducing gas supplies to Europe was the key driver, and 28% blamed increasing global demand.

Sky News has previously reported that oil and gas companies are enjoying record profits as a result of the rising price of energy, leading both the Liberal Democrat and Labour parties to call for a windfall tax to help ease the financial pain for UK consumers, something that the government has so far resisted.

There have also been calls from the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of around 20 Conservative MPs for the government to provide solutions to the cost of living and the energy price crisis by scrapping green levies from energy bills and increasing gas drilling in the North Sea.

But only 13% of the 2,000 people surveyed agreed that removing green levies from bills was the answer, and even fewer thought that fracking or more gas from the North Sea was the right approach.

Half of those questioned said that the best option was to decrease reliance on gas by using more renewable energy and better insulating homes.

However, the survey did reveal significant concern about the cost of getting to the UK's target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Although there was broad (73%) support for the target itself, nearly a third of people agreed with the statement ""we can't afford to implement policies intended to address climate change, they cost the taxpayer and consumers too much at a time when they can afford them least.""

'Future generations will suffer'

Just over half agreed with ""we can't afford not to implement policies intended to address climate change - the damaging effects of climate change are here already - and future generations will suffer further if we don't act now.""

The government's Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that the cost of getting to net zero in the UK will be nearly £1.5trn, although that investment should eventually deliver over £1trn of savings.

The Treasury has not ruled out tax rises or reducing public spending to find the money to pay for this, and the issue has become the subject of growing dispute among Conservative benches.

A report from consultancy group McKinsey recently said that global spending on reaching net zero could be up to $9.2trn per year up to 2050, although this would be far less than the cost of not tackling climate change.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126150924/http://news.sky.com/story/energy-crisis-a-third-of-people-blame-profiteering-by-energy-companies-for-gas-price-rises-new-poll-12525762;

Data released by the Office for National Statics found people from these two groups remained at higher risk of death from COVID-19 during the third wave - even after adjusting for vaccination status.

From 13 June 2021 onwards, the risk for Bangladeshi communities from the virus was 4.4 and 5.2 times greater than white British men and women.

COVID news latest - New variant could prolong current wave, experts warn

Image: Two groups remained at higher risk of death, even taking vaccination status into account

It was more than two times greater even when adjusting for vaccine status and other variables such as socio-economic factors.

During the third wave, Pakistani men were found to be 3.5 times more likely to die from COVID than the white British group.

Even when factoring in vaccine status and other relevant variables, they were still 1.2 times more likely to die from COVID.

""Remaining unexplained risk may be attributable to factors that we have not been able to account for in the analysis,"" the research said.

""The Cabinet Office Race Disparity Unit has explored the evidence around COVID-19 risk factors, but further work is needed to increase our knowledge and understanding of the possible mechanisms underlying this unexplained risk.""

This does not suggest the vaccine is not effective within these groups but means differences in vaccination coverage does not explain the observed differences in mortality risk.

Vaccines explain mortality in other groups

However, the study also found vaccine uptake did explain a large part of the differences in mortality between other ethnic groups.

The rate of death involving COVID-19 has been higher for almost all ethnic minority groups throughout the pandemic, and this was seen again during the third wave, from 13 June 2021 onwards.

While factors - such as geography and age - explained some of the excess risk, differences in vaccine uptake explain the rest.

For example, men and women from black Caribbean and black Caribbean backgrounds were seen to be at a higher risk from COVID - two groups with the lowest vaccination rates among those aged over 50.

But adjusting for vaccination status (alongside other factors) eliminated the excess risk for these groups and suggested they were at no greater risk than the white British population.

Vahé Nafilyan, senior statistician at the ONS, said: ""Today's analysis shows that since the vaccination programme began, the risk of death from COVID-19 has continued to be higher in most ethnic minority groups than in the white British ethnic group.

""As already highlighted in our analyses of earlier periods, these differences in mortality are largely explained by socio-demographic and economic factors and health.

""For the first time, we show that the lower vaccination coverage in some ethnic groups also contributes to the elevated risk of COVID-19 death, particularly in the black African and black Caribbean groups.""

Nine in 10 young teenagers have antibodies

Separate data released by the ONS also found approximately 98% of the UK's population now has COVID-19 antibodies and nine in 10 young teenagers are also likely to have antibodies.

The estimates, which are for children aged 12 to 15, range from 88% in Wales, to 91.7% in Scotland, 90.9% in England, and 90.7% in Northern Ireland.

It is the first time data has been published for this age group.

It takes between two and three weeks after infection or vaccination for the body to make enough antibodies to fight the virus. Antibodies then remain in the blood at low levels, although these levels can decline over time to the point where tests can no longer detect them.

The figures have been calculated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and are based on a sample of blood test results for the week beginning 3 January 2022.

The very high level of antibodies among young teenagers reflects both the prevalence of coronavirus but also the impact of the vaccination programme, with first doses made available for 12 to 15 year olds in September 2021.

Second doses are now being rolled out to this age group.

The ONS said there is a ""clear pattern"" between vaccination and testing positive for COVID-19 antibodies but ""the detection of antibodies alone is not a precise measure of the immunity protection given by vaccination"".

Majority adhered to isolation rules

The ONS found between 4 January to 8 January, the majority (79%) of survey respondents who did test positive for the virus fully adhered to self-isolation guidance.

This was broadly in line with levels reported for September (78%) and November (75%), and slightly higher than levels seen in December 2021 (74%).

Biologists at the California Academy of Sciences said Methuselah, who weighs 40lbs, was brought to the San Francisco museum in 1938 from Australia.

She is being given the ""best possible care"" and ""hopefully thrives"" - but can be ""a little picky"" with her food.

A primitive species with lungs and gills, Australian lungfish are believed to be an evolutionary link between fish and amphibians.

She likes fresh figs and belly rubs

The Australian lungfish is a threatened species but the museum has two others which are younger and believed to be aged in their 40s or 50s.

Methuselah likes to eat fresh figs, get belly rubs and is named after the Biblical figure, Noah's grandfather, who was said to have lived to be 969-years-old.

Her first appearance in the San Francisco Chronicle was in 1947: ""These strange creatures, with green scales looking like fresh artichoke leaves, are known to scientists as a possible 'missing link' between terrestrial and aquatic animals.""

The previous oldest Australian lungfish on record was at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago - but died in 2017 at the age of 95.

""By default, Methuselah is the oldest,"" said Allan Jan, senior biologist at the California Academy of Sciences and the fish's keeper.

Methuselah's caretakers believe the fish is female, although it is difficult to determine the species' sex without a risky blood draw.

Image: Senior biologist Allan Jan said Methuselah enjoys a belly rub. Pic: AP

The academy is planning to send a tiny sample of her fin to researchers in Australia, who will try to confirm the sex and determine the fish's exact age.

Mr Jan said Methuselah likes getting rubbed on her back and belly and has a ""mellow"" personality.

He added: ""I tell my volunteers, pretend she's an underwater puppy, very mellow, gentle, but of course if she gets spooked she will have sudden bouts of energy.

""But for the most part she's just calm.

""We just give her the best possible care we can provide, and hopefully she thrives.""

The Falcon 9 booster from Elon Musk's space company has been drifting since February 2015, when it helped put a weather satellite into orbit.

It's now expected to hit the moon on 4 March at 2.58km/s, according to Bill Gray - a data analyst who tracks near-Earth objects.

He said it's the ""first unintentional case"" of space junk hitting the moon that he is aware of.

""For those asking: yes, an old Falcon 9 second stage left in high orbit in 2015 is going to hit the moon on March 4. It's interesting, but not a big deal,"" he tweeted.

The moment of impact will not be observable as it's forecast to hit the far side of the moon.

""The bulk of the moon is in the way, and even if it were on the near side, the impact occurs a couple of days after New Moon,"" Mr Gray said in his blog.

However, he said there will be a short viewing window of a day or two in early February when it ""will be bright, close and moving fast"".

These final observations should allow experts to refine the impact point to around a kilometre, possibly better, and the new crater may allow scientists to learn something about the geology of that part of the moon.

As well as large pieces of space junk such as the Falcon booster, NASA says there are about 23,000 pieces of debris bigger than a softball orbiting Earth at speeds of up to 17,500mph.

They were doing that at gatherings of ordinary folk all over London during the pandemic, regularly citing their gentle ""4Es"" approach of Engage, Explain, Encourage and, as a last resort, Enforce the unprecedented coronavirus health laws.

It was a Metropolitan Police initiative that was later adopted across the country, but seemingly not in a small area of Westminster.

It's more than a suspicion and it was a damning statement from London Assembly member Unmesh Desai that preceded the commissioner's revelation of the No 10 investigation: ""The proximity of your officers to the rule-breaking taking place... the perception that you're covering for those in power has been building for some time.""

'We will find out about that'

How many officers might have known what was going on? Well, those who guard the gates to Downing Street past whom the suitcase of wine bottles must have been trundled, the PM's protection team and the cop on the door, for starters, though the Commissioner spoke mysteriously of ""the ones you see"", suggesting there are others.

Dame Cressida wouldn't be drawn on whether her officers had turned a blind eye but added, ominously: ""In relation to anything they may have seen or heard or done or not done... if that's a relevant matter we will find out about that.""

The bigger issue, of course, is how far her special inquiry team goes in search of new evidence. It's unlikely anyone will get arrested, but principal suspects and key witnesses are likely to be interviewed ""under caution"", the more formal process that's short of having your collar felt.

But whatever the force does it will be damned, as it was the last time it launched a major investigation into the then Labour government and other political parties over the cash-for-honours scandal in 2006.

His lordship said later he was arrested only so detectives could get access to documents he would have handed them willingly anyway.

Investigation leaks hastened PM's departure

The upshot was that no one was ever charged, and the police were accused of overreacting, but the leaks from the investigation were thought to have damaged the Labour Party and hastened Blair's resignation months later.

Why is the Met now investigating?

The police decided to investigate on Sunday, according to The Times, after receiving evidence from Sue Gray's Cabinet Office team of potential criminal breaches.

Dame Cressida explained that although police guidance has been to not investigate potential COVID breaches ""long after they are said to have taken place"", three key criteria for those ""serious"" and ""most flagrant"" allegations that should be probed had been met.

They are:

evidence that those involved knew or ought to have known they were committing an offence

that by not investigating it would significantly undermine the legitimacy of the law

that there is little ambiguity over the absence of any reasonable defence

Who is leading it?

The Met inquiry will be carried out by detectives from the force's Special Enquiries Team, which specialises in sensitive cases and will be overseen by senior management.

It will be led by Jane Connors, the force's deputy assistant commissioner and lead for COVID enforcement.

A Scotland Yard source described her to the Telegraph as the ""epitome of no nonsense"".

She played a key role in the strategic response to the 2017 Westminster terror attack and has been in charge of handling the Extinction Rebellion protests that have crippled parts of London.

How is it different to the Gray inquiry?

The police have much wider-reaching powers than Sue Gray and the Cabinet Office.

Reports have claimed that some Downing Street staff have been reluctant to give evidence to the Gray inquiry, but they would have to if asked to by detectives.

The Met can interview both potential organisers and guests of any events and compel them to submit phone records and other material.

They are still allowed to answer 'no comment', however.

Detectives already have access to CCTV footage from outside Downing Street and other government buildings and any notes or reports made by protection officers guarding them.

But they could ask for further footage to track people's movements.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:44 Joshua Rozenberg gives his take on the scope of the Met inquiry

What could the punishment be?

The Coronavirus Act 2020 meant police could issue fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to anyone breaking the rules.

Initially this meant a £60 fine, doubling each time for repeat offences. People had 28 days to pay or they risked being arrested or summoned to court.

On 13 May 2020, this was increased to £100 and in September to £200 - reduced to £100 if paid within 14 days, and doubling up to £6,400 for repeat offences.

In August 2020 the law also changed so that organisers of large events of 30 people or more could be fined up to £10,000.

Those who attended gatherings of at least 15 people risked an £800 maximum fine.

Image: A police officer reminds people of COVID rules in Brighton in May 2020

Human rights barrister Adam Wagner told Sky News that any potential fine will depend on what the law was at the time of an alleged offence.

He added that officials could also be prosecuted for misconduct in public office - not just under the COVID act - ""if their conduct was in breach of public trust and was serious enough"".

But legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg said that being a common law offence, prosecution guidance on misconduct in public office is ""terribly vague and unclear"".

""The Crown Prosecution Service would need to offer independent advice to the police on this,"" he told Sky News.

What will it cover?

Dame Cressida refused to reveal which alleged events could be included in the investigation, but said that FPNs ""will not be issued in every instance and to every person"".

Here we look at which events the Met investigation could cover and what the rules were at the time.

15 May 2020

A photo published by The Guardian shows Boris Johnson, his wife Carrie, principal private secretary Martin Reynolds and then-special adviser Dominic Cummings in the Downing Street garden.

Former health secretary Matt Hancock was also reported to be there, alongside around 20 other staff.

Sources claim they drank wine and ate food and the prime minister was there for 15 minutes when he said his colleagues deserved a drink for ""beating back coronavirus"".

What were the rules?

Only two people were allowed to socialise with each other - only outdoors - not in private gardens - and providing social distancing was maintained.

In England FPNs were set at £100.

20 May 2020

An email obtained by ITV News showed that the PM's principal private secretary Martin Reynolds emailed staff on 20 May 2020 inviting them to ""some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"" that evening.

It read: ""Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening. Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!""

Mr Johnson admitted he attended the drinks at around 6pm and stayed for 25 minutes to thank staff - 40 of which are believed to have been there.

He later said he ""believed implicitly"" it was a work event.

What were the rules?

The same rules on meeting one other person outside applied at this point, with £100 fines doubling for repeat offences.

On the same day a man named Nuradeem Mohammad was stopped by police in Ealing Road, west London for ""being in a gathering of over two people without reasonable excuse"", court documents reveal.

The 28-year-old was fined £100 and made to pay £134 court costs, the Evening Standard reported.

19 June 2020

The prime minister celebrated his birthday inside the Cabinet Room at Number 10, according to ITV News.

His wife Carrie Johnson is alleged to have brought him a cake and other members of staff were there to sing him happy birthday.

The broadcaster also claims family friends of the PM were hosted upstairs at Downing Street.

Number 10 has said the reports are ""totally untrue"" and that staff gathered for 10 minutes to wish the PM a happy birthday in the afternoon and in the evening a small number of friends were hosted in the garden ""in line with the rules"".

What were the rules?

From 1 June 2020 groups of six people were allowed to meet outdoors, including in private gardens, providing they maintained social distancing of two metres.

13 November 2020

On the day Mr Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings was seen leaving Downing Street with a box of his belongings, he said a party was held inside the Downing Street flat where the PM and his wife Carrie live.

Number 10 denied this.

The Times reported separately that Mr Johnson gave a leaving speech for his outgoing head of communications Lee Cain.

Image: Dominic Cummings leaves Downing Street with a box of his things on 13 November 2020

What were the rules?

England was in its second national lockdown between 5 November and 2 December.

People were not allowed to leave home unless for essential reasons - and they were only allowed to meet one other person from outside their household to socialise - as long as it was outdoors and not in a private garden.

On 31 August, rules were brought in that could see people fined £10,000 for organising or facilitating large gatherings of more than 30 people.

Participating in a gathering of more than 15 people also carried maximum fines of £800.

On 24 September the on-the-spot fine for single COVID breaches was also increased to £200, decreasing to £100 if paid within 14 days.

25 November 2020

The Treasury confirmed that ""impromptu drinks"" happened there while staff were working on the Autumn Spending Review.

According to The Times around two dozen civil servants were present.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was not there and was not aware of it.

What were the rules?

Lockdown rules were still in place with £10,000 maximum fines for large gatherings.

In Rubery, Worcestershire that month a woman called Andrea Lloyd was fined £200 by West Mercia Police when her ex-partner dropped off their son at her home.

She was taken to court for refusing to pay the fine, but the case was later dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.

10 December 2020

Permanent Secretary at the Department for Education Susan Acland-Hood confirmed to MPs that a Christmas party was held there which was also attended by then-education secretary Gavin Williamson.

The story was first reported by the Daily Mirror.

What were the rules?

London was in Tier 2 COVID restrictions after it emerged from the second lockdown.

Groups of six people could meet outdoors, but indoor mixing with anyone outside your household was banned in homes, pubs and restaurants.

Hospitality venues were only allowed to serve alcohol with substantial meals and had to take last orders at 10pm and close by 11pm.

15 December 2020

A photo published by the Sunday Mirror showed Boris Johnson taking part in an online Downing Street Christmas Zoom quiz.

He was flanked by colleagues and staff were reported to have huddled around computers in various groups around Downing Street.

The newspaper claimed alcohol was consumed during the quiz, which was hosted by the PM for between 10 and 15 minutes.

What were the rules?

London was still in Tier 2 restrictions with £10,000 maximum fines for large gatherings.

16 December 2020

After a report in the Daily Mirror, the Department for Transport confirmed that ""fewer than a dozen staff who were working in the office had a low-key, socially distanced, gathering in the large open-plan officer after work"" that day.

They said ""food and drink was consumed"" and apologised for the ""error of judgement"".

What were the rules?

On 16 December, London moved into Tier 3 COVID restrictions.

This meant all pubs, bars and restaurants being closed except for takeaway, drive-through or delivery.

Groups of six could meet outside - but not in private gardens - and all indoor mixing of households was banned.

17 December 2020

A virtual quiz was held in the private office of Cabinet Secretary Simon Case. He did not take part but is thought to have walked in at one point, so knew it was happening.

Sky News understands the event was referred to as 'Christmas Party' in e-calendars and involved six people on the rota in the office and six at home. It allegedly lasted an hour and included drinks and snacks.

Simon Case had to be replaced by Sue Gray in leading the inquiry into Downing Street parties after the story emerged.

Separately that evening then director-general of the COVID Taskforce Kate Josephs admitted to hosting ""drinks in our office in the Cabinet Office to mark my leaving the civil service"".

What were the rules?

London was still in Tier 3 COVID restrictions, with £10,000 maximum fines for large gatherings.

18 December 2020

Around 40 staff are reported to have had a cheese and wine evening inside Downing Street, with Secret Santa gifts exchanged and awards handed out by director of communications Jack Doyle.

People stayed until 2am, Sky News understands.

Former adviser to Boris Johnson Allegra Stratton was forced to resign after being caught on camera joking about the event at a fake press conference.

What were the rules?

London was still in Tier 3 restrictions.

The following month, when England was in its third national lockdown, nine Met Police officers were fined £200 each for eating inside a closed restaurant in Greenwich, southeast London.

Like in Tier 3, lockdown rules closed all hospitality venues apart from takeaways.

16 April 2021

Two gatherings were held inside Downing Street on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral, the Daily Telegraph reported.

They were held in different parts of the complex, but joined up later in the evening, each with around 30 guests, sources said.

The first was a leaving party for the PM's outgoing director of communications James Slack.

And the second was reportedly for a departing Downing Street photographer, attended mainly by younger members of staff in the basement.

The newspaper said that drinking and dancing went on until at least midnight, with one person sent to the Co-op on the Strand with a suitcase to fill with alcohol.

Following the reports, an apology was made to the Queen and a Number 10 spokesman said the PM was not in Downing Street on the day of the events.

""It is deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning and Number 10 has apologised to the Palace,"" the PM's spokesperson said.

What were the rules?

Indoor socialising with other households was banned.

People were allowed to meet with a group of six people or two households outside.

Pubs and restaurants were open but could only serve customers outdoors.

Fines of up to £10,000 for large gatherings of more than 30 people were still being imposed.

On the Isle of Man on 25 April 2021, a man named Sam Culshaw was arrested and fined £1,000 for being in a car with someone not in his household.

The team's Olympic passes were shipped to Jamaica while they were training in Europe and have now been sent by FedEx to the UK.

However, after arriving at Stansted airport last Friday, the crucial documents have still not been released for delivery which is jeopardising the team's chances of making their flights to Beijing from London's Heathrow airport this Friday.

Pilot Shanwayne Stephens told Sky News: ""It's a shame that something so simple could put four years of hard work in jeopardy.

He added: ""We would be heartbroken if we missed our flight. We would really appreciate it if the accreditation could be delivered in the coming days.""

The Jamaican quartet is made up of Stephens, Ashley Watson, Matthew Wekpe and Nimroy Turgott.

While fully committed to pursuing their Olympic dream, they do not have the kind of funding enjoyed by most of their rivals - they told Sky News they simply can't afford to miss their flights which have cost approximately £20,000.

Accreditation more vital than usual

The strict COVID-19 protocols around the Winter Olympics mean that accreditation passes are even more vital than usual.

Image: Due to funding limitations, the quartet cannot afford to miss their flights on Friday

Performance director Mark Silva, who is trying desperately to get the accreditations released, told Sky News: ""I've been chasing this for days now, all FedEx will tell me is that they have escalated the request.

""We can't sort out the visas properly until we have the accreditations and this is properly stressful - the whole Olympic dream depends on us making that flight on Friday.""

It's 24 years since Jamaica had a four-man bobsleigh team at the Winter Games - the very first team they entered in 1988 inspired the hit film Cool Runnings.

The 2022 team have been finalising their preparations this week on a practice track at Bath University while they wait for their accreditations.

FedEx and London Stansted airport have been approached for comment.

Mandatory wearing of face masks is being scrapped as part of the lifting of Plan B measures - with work from home guidance and COVID passports also being dropped.

Sainsbury's told Sky News it will continue to have a number of safety measures in its stores in an effort to keep customers and staff safe.

Its guidance will also apply to Argos and Habitat stores, which are part of the Sainsbury's business group.

A spokesperson for Sainsbury's said: ""Safety remains our highest priority.

""From Thursday, we're asking our customers and colleagues in England to continue to wear a face covering in our stores if they are able to.

""In Scotland and Wales face coverings remain mandatory for those who can wear them in our stores, in line with the latest government restrictions.

""We continue to have a range of safety measures in all of our stores, including screens and sanitising stations.""

Waitrose and John Lewis are ""suggesting"" customers and staff should wear a face covering when inside their stores.

A John Lewis spokesperson told Sky News: ""We value the safety of our customers and partners and continue to follow the latest government guidelines.

""From Thursday, we'll be suggesting people wear masks in our stores, although it will be down to individuals to make a personal choice.""

The pair were part of The Smiths, famous for hits such as This Charming Man and There Is A Light That Never Goes Out, for about five years together, in the 1980s.

They split in 1987 after press speculation of a rift between guitarist Marr and singer Morrissey and never reformed - however both have gone on to have successful solo careers.

Writing on his website, Morrissey said: ""This is not a rant or an hysterical bombast. It is a polite and calmly measured request: Would you please stop mentioning my name in your interviews?

""Would you please, instead, discuss your own career, your own unstoppable solo achievements and your own music? If you can, would you please just leave me out of it?""

He also said that they have not known each other for 35 years, adding that they both made each other as successful as they are.

""Can you not just leave it at that? Must you persistently, year after year, decade after decade, blame me for everything…from the 2007 Solomon Islands tsunami to the dribble on your grandma's chin?""

Morrissey continues: ""If I was, as you claim, such an eyesore monster, where exactly did this leave you? Kidnapped? Mute? Chained? Abducted by cross-eyed extraterrestrials? It was YOU who played guitar on 'Golden Lights' - not me.

""Yes, we all know that the British press will print anything you say about me as long as it's cruel and savage. But you've done all that. Move on. It's as if you can't uncross your own legs without mentioning me.""

He goes on to wish good health upon the guitarist, and asks him several more times to leave him out of interviews.

""Please stop. It is 2022, not 1982.""

Marr responded to the letter, tweeting: ""Dear [Morrissey].

1785;1785;Boris Johnson authorised evacuation of animals from Afghanistan, Foreign Office emails suggest;Wednesday 26 January 2022 17:38, UK;[];['afghanistan', 'boris johnson'];['prime', 'authorised', 'office', 'minister', 'afghanistan', 'nowzad', 'boris', 'farthing', 'animals', 'emails', 'suggest', 'johnson', 'pen', 'foreign', 'evacuation'];"Whistleblower emails have raised further questions over Boris Johnson's insistence that he did not intervene to assist animal charities during the evacuation of Afghanistan.

Last December the prime minister dismissed claims made by a former Foreign Office official that the government prioritised animals over people as ""complete nonsense"".

But new emails released by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, which is conducting an inquiry into the government's handling of the Afghanistan crisis, suggest Mr Johnson did personally authorise rescue efforts for pets and animals.

In other news, emails just published by @CommonsForeign re the Afghan evacuation refer to the PM giving personal authorisation for the Nowzad animals to be evacuated.



This was denied by No10 spokesman. pic.twitter.com/tvzx8Gi6vG — Tamara Cohen (@tamcohen) January 26, 2022

What do the new emails say?

On 25 August 2021, an official working for Foreign Office minister Lord Goldsmith sent an email to the Foreign Office ""special cases"" team regarding the possible evacuation of an unnamed animal charity.

In it the official writes: ""Equivalent charity Nowzad, run by an ex-Royal Marine, has received a lot of publicity and the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated, [animal charity - name redacted] are hoping to be treated in the same capacity"".

This appears to support claims made last year in written evidence by whistleblower Raphael Marshall, a desk officer at the Foreign Office, that the department ""received an instruction from the prime minister"" to use ""considerable capacity"" to help animals leave the country that were being cared for by Nowzad, run by Paul ""Pen"" Farthing.

""There was a direct trade-off between transporting Nowzad's animals and evacuating British nationals and Afghan evacuees, including Afghans who had served with British soldiers,"" he said.

Asked about this at the time, the PM said: ""No, that's complete nonsense.

""What I can tell you is that Operation Pitting, to airlift 15,000 people out of Kabul in the way that we did over the summer, was one of the outstanding military achievements of the last 50 years or more.

""The role of the Foreign Office, the role of Border Force, everybody involved in it, the Home Office officials, they did an absolutely outstanding job, processing very difficult, very complex claims, incredibly quickly.""

Image: Pen Farthing, founder of British charity Nowzad, called for the evacuation of animals from Afghanistan

Mr Farthing launched a campaign to get his staff and animals out of Afghanistan as the Taliban overran Kabul, using a plane funded through donations.

The UK government sponsored clearance for a charter flight, which sparked claims that animals had been prioritised over people.

Asked about the new emails, the PM's official spokesman said: ""It remains the case that the PM didn't instruct officials to take any particular course of action.""

This was reiterated by a Number 10 spokesperson, who said: ""The prime minister had no role in authorising individual evacuations from Afghanistan during Op PITTING, including Nowzad staff and animals.

""At no point did the prime minister instruct staff to take any particular course of action on Nowzad.""

I did not authorise & do not support anything that would have put animals’ lives ahead of peoples’. My position, which I made clear publicly, was that the UK should prioritise evacuating people. I never discussed the NOWZAD charity or their efforts to evacuate animals with the PM — Zac Goldsmith (@ZacGoldsmith) January 26, 2022

Lord Goldsmith tweeted: ""I did not authorise & do not support anything that would have put animals' lives ahead of peoples'.""

He added that he ""never discussed the Nowzad charity or their efforts to evacuate animals with the PM"".

And Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said ""at no point"" was he told by Mr Johnson to ""evacuate Pen Farthing, his workforce or his pets"".

""As I made clear at the time, we were not going to put pets before people and as the actions showed, Pen Farthing left last and his workforce had to leave after the evacuation was concluded via other means,"" he said in a statement.

Image: The defence secretary denied the government 'put pets before people'

""The evacuation was a Ministry of Defence led operation, supported by application processing by the Home Office and FCDO.

""The idea that an environment minister and his officials had any authority or responsibility in the running of the evacuation is ludicrous.""

However, Dominic Dyer, an animal rights campaigner who lobbied the prime minister to evacuate Pen Farthing and his animals, told Sky News that Boris Johnson ""played a key role in the evacuation operation"".

He said the newly-released emails ""vindicate what I've been saying since August"" - that ""there were clear lines being given by senior officials that the prime minister was giving strong support to the project"".

Asked why the PM denied it, Mr Dyer added: ""It became a difficult situation, with Ministry of Defence seeing problems with the whole operation... there was a lot of tension between different Whitehall departments.""

PM told to come to Commons and face MPs

Labour MP Chris Bryant, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told Sky News: ""This goes back to the moral authority of the prime minister and whether the prime minister tells the truth.""

He said the PM should face MPs and answer questions.

""His authority, integrity and honour are on the line. He should come to the chamber and defend it,"" Mr Bryant said.

Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said: ""Once again, the prime minister has been caught out lying about what he has been doing and deciding.

""He should never have given priority to flying animals out of Afghanistan while Afghans who worked for our armed forces were left behind.""

Layla Moran, foreign affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said the ""damning revelation shows that Boris Johnson has once again repeatedly lied to the British people"".

""Boris Johnson's house of cards continues to come tumbling down. He must immediately make a public statement to correct the record and for once tell the truth,"" she said.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126180428/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-authorised-evacuation-of-animals-from-afghanistan-foreign-office-emails-suggest-12525830;

Sky News understands from three government sources that, as of Wednesday afternoon, the report is yet to have been sent to Number 10 as senior civil servant Ms Gray is running it past lawyers, HR and the Metropolitan Police to make sure the document can be published in full.

This requires a delicate checking process to be carried out due to the duty of care there is to Downing Street staff who may be implicated in the report.

PM braces for release of 'partygate' report - politics live

The prime minister has vowed to make a statement and answer questions in the House of Commons after the Gray report has been made public.

But with the House of Commons having adjourned for the day almost three hours earlier than scheduled before 5pm, any consideration of the findings in the chamber by MPs will now have to wait until Thursday at earliest.

Meanwhile, earlier today, the prime minister failed to explicitly commit to publishing the full report once the findings of the long-awaited inquiry are finally received by Downing Street.

Asked at PMQs by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer if he will release the entirety of Ms Gray's report, the prime minister replied: ""We've got to leave the report to the independent investigator, as he knows, of course when I receive it, of course, I will do exactly what I said.""

Questioning the PM, Sir Keir noted the ministerial code states that ministers who knowingly mislead parliament are expected to offer their resignation

""Does the prime minister believe that applies to him?""

Mr Johnson replied: ""Of course, but let me tell the House that I think he is inviting a question about an investigation which is - as you know, Mr Speaker, I cannot comment - and which he, as a lawyer, will know that I can't comment on.""

Speaking to Kay Burley earlier on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the government would release the ""findings"" from the Cabinet Office inquiry.

However, she said there could be ""security issues"" which mean parts of it are ""problematic to publish"".

Ms Truss also said Boris Johnson has her ""100% support"" as the prime minister faces calls, including from some of his Conservative MPs, to resign over the partygate revelations.

The foreign secretary said she did not attend any parties in Downing Street and was not invited to any.

The crisis engulfing the PM deepened on Tuesday when the Metropolitan Police announced it is investigating a ""number of events"" in Downing Street and across Whitehall for potential breaches of COVID-19 regulations.

On Wednesday afternoon, Conservative MP Mark Logan told Sky News a ""change to the infrastructure around the prime minister"" was needed, adding: ""But I believe if he digs - and when he digs deep - is that we can make that change and we can get over what has been a difficult couple of weeks for the government and for the country.""

Uncertainty over report's publication

Expectations had been raised that Mr Johnson would address the Gray report's findings in the Commons on Wednesday lunchtime.

On Tuesday afternoon, it was understood that Number 10 would publish the report compiled around midday and then the PM would make a statement in the Commons after PMQs.

But the timing still remains unclear.

PM's predicament has arguably worsened - but he seems to be less at sea Beth Rigby Political editor @BethRigby Arguably Mr Johnson's predicament has worsened since a week ago - new revelations and a police investigation - but he seems, for now, to be slightly less at sea. One senior neutral backbencher told me they think the ""Save Boris"" operation is doing a good job. ""They are definitely steadying the ship. The question is now dividing into two parts: does Boris Johnson survive for now, given the prospect of replacing him too grizzly and draining? And then, does he lead us into the next election? If we save him now but he's still flatlining in a few months, well then that is a question for later in the year."" But all of these efforts could come to nothing should the Sue Gray report deliver evidence that condemns the PM in the eyes of wavering MPs. For all Mr Johnson's allies, there are plenty of opponents. It is known there's a lot of unease amongst the 50-strong One Nation Tories who were ostracised by this PM and his team over Brexit. This group doesn't operate as a unit and will take decisions individually, but it's fair to say a lot of them are thoroughly fed up with Mr Johnson. There is also the band of 2019-ers who were poised to put letters in last week and are now waiting to see what the Gray Report says. And for all the speculation about the report, no-one really knows what is in it apart from Sue Gray. We don't know when it will be delivered to Number 10, ready for publication, although the expectation is that it could come as early as tonight and certainly within the coming days. I'm told by government sources that Ms Gray is checking the report with lawyers, human resources and the Met police to make sure what she sends to Downing Street can be published in full. MPs will then have to decide whether they can fall in behind him or call for him to go. He's in the danger zone. The best he can hope for is to avoid a confidence vote, which will be triggered should 54 of his own MPs decide they've had enough and submit letters of no confidence. But even if he can survive the coming weeks, can he ever really recover in the eyes of the public and his party? It was just over two years ago that Boris Johnson won a majority of 80. Now he's in office but not in power. I've never witnessed such an astonishing fall from grace.

It is thought many MPs are likely to be away from Westminster on Thursday, instead attending ceremonies to mark Holocaust Memorial Day in their constituencies.

Opposition parties had voiced concern on Tuesday that, if published today, they would not be given sufficient time to read the document before any potential statement from the PM later in the day.

Sky News understands Ms Gray wants the report to be published in full and it will cover all the alleged events, not just those the police are not investigating.

Labour has called for the report to be published ""in full"" - with Sir Keir saying anything less would amount to a ""cover-up"".

The party could try and use parliamentary procedures to try and force the publication of the document in full.

Such an attempt could take the form of a ""humble address"", effectively a message to the Queen demanding the publication of papers.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick announced on Tuesday that the force was investigating ""a number of events"" for potential breaches of COVID-19 regulations.

Mr Johnson has welcomed the probe and said it would ""help draw a line under matters"".

Sources have told Sky News this investigation will take ""weeks, not days"".

1787;1787;FIFA president Gianni Infantino says World Cup every two years could mean African migrants 'don't need to die in the sea';Wednesday 26 January 2022 17:24, UK;[];['fifa'];['president', 'sea', 'world', 'gianni', 'future', 'unacceptable', 'migrants', 'cup', 'mean', 'fifa', 'football', 'rest', 'dont', 'infantino', 'need', 'include'];"FIFA President Gianni Infantino has said his plan to hold the World Cup every two years could stop African migrants dying in the Mediterranean Sea.

Mr Infantino made the comments at a session of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe - a transnational organisation focused on human rights.

The FIFA boss is one of the main backers of the Future of Football strategy, designed to promote greater inclusion of non-European teams, mainly through more regular tournaments.

He said on Wednesday: ""This topic is not about whether we want a World Cup every two years, but about what do we want to do for the future of our football.

""I think about the rest of the world… and the vast majority of Europe, then we have to think about what football brings.

""Football is about opportunity, about hope, about the national teams.

""We cannot say to the rest of the world give us your money, but watch us on TV. We need to include them.""

Speaking specifically about Africa, Mr Infantino added: ""We need to find ways to include the whole world to give hope to Africans so that they don't need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find maybe a better life but, more probably, death in the sea.

""We need to give opportunities, to give dignity. Not by charity but by allowing the rest of the world to participate. Maybe the World Cup every two years is not the answer. We discuss it.""

The comments have been heavily criticised as ""completely unacceptable"" by anti-racism campaign group Kick It Out chief executive Tony Burnett.

He said: ""It is completely unacceptable to suggest that a biennial World Cup, predominantly set up to drive further profits for FIFA, could be a solution for migrants who risk their lives, sometimes fleeing war-torn countries, to seek a better life.""

UEFA president Alexsander Ceferin has also expressed ""grave concerns"" over the Future of Football project.

He claims it will undermine and clash with smaller regional tournaments such as the Africa Cup of Nations and the Copa America.

Critics have also argued it would leave players overworked and exhausted, while supporters say it will give smaller nations more chances to qualify to play at international level.

Other backers include ex-Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, now chief of global football development at FIFA, Saudi Arabia, and former footballers such as Michael Owen and Yaya Toure.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126180428/http://news.sky.com/story/fifa-president-gianni-infantino-says-world-cup-every-two-years-could-mean-african-migrants-dont-need-to-die-in-the-sea-12525891;
1788;1788;US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer to retire at end of his term, reports say;Wednesday 26 January 2022 17:40, UK;['amar mehta', '@amarjournalist_'];['us supreme court', 'united states'];['president', 'law', 'senate', 'end', 'breyer', 'supreme', 'reports', 'mr', 'stephen', 'say', 'court', 'retire', 'biden', 'conservative', 'justice', 'term'];"Liberal US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer will retire at the end of his term, NBC News has reported.

Press secretary Jen Psaki said the White House had no additional details on the reports.

His retirement would give Joe Biden his first Supreme Court appointment of his presidency.

President Bill Clinton appointed Mr Breyer in 1994 after Harry Blackmun stepped down from the role.

Mr Bryer is one of the three remaining liberal judges and at 83, he is the court's oldest member.

The justice has been a pragmatic member of an increasingly conservative court, trying to force majorities with more moderate justices right and left of centre.

In 2020, former President Donald Trump appointed conservative justice, Amy Barrett after Ruth Ginsburg died from cancer.

Mr Breyer's departure is expected to happen over the summer but it won't change the conservative-liberal make-up, with Mr Biden likely to nominate a liberal.

The appointment will almost certainly be confirmed by the Senate, where Democrats have a slight majority.

Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, will be the oldest member of the court at the age of 73.

Who could President Biden nominate?

Experts have already started drawing up potential nominees, California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, US Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, prominent civil rights lawyer Sherrilyn Ifill and US District Judge Michelle Childs, whom Mr Biden has nominated to be an appeals court judge.

Ms Childs is a favourite of Republican James Clyburn, who made a crucial endorsement of Mr Biden just before South Carolina's presidential primary in 2020.

Who is Stephen Breyer?

Mr Breyer was often overshadowed by his fellow liberal Ms Ginsburg, but during his time on the Supreme Court, he has penned two opinions pieces in support of abortion rights on a court closely divided over the issue, and he laid out his growing discomfort with the death penalty in a series of dissenting opinions in recent years.

However, Breyer also shared views on displaying the Ten Commandments on government property, illustrating his search for a middle ground.

In 2005, he was the only member that barred Ten Commandments display in two Kentucky courthouses but allowed one to remain in Texas.

Mr Breyer is a frequent public speaker and is known for his elaborate, at times far-fetched, hypothetical questions to lawyers during arguments,

He also spent time working for the late Senator Edward Kennedy when the Massachusetts Democrat was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

His time working in the Senate led to his appointment by President Jimmy Carter as a federal appeals court judge in Boston, and he was confirmed with bipartisan support even after Mr Carter's defeat for reelection in 1980.

MR Breyer served for 14 years on the First US Circuit Court of Appeals before moving up to the Supreme Court.

Born in San Francisco, Breyer became an Eagle Scout as a teenager and began a stellar academic career at Stanford, graduating with the highest honours.

He attended Oxford, where he received first-class honours in philosophy, politics and economics.

Mr Breyer then attended Harvard's law school, where he worked on the Law Review and again, graduated with the highest honours.

His first job after law school was as a law clerk to Goldberg and he then worked in the Justice Department's antitrust division before splitting time as a Harvard law professor and a lawyer for the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Mr Breyer and his wife, Joanna, a psychologist and daughter of the late British Conservative leader John Blakenham, have three children - daughters Chloe and Nell and a son, Michael - and six grandchildren.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126180428/http://news.sky.com/story/us-supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-to-retire-at-end-of-his-term-reports-12525987;

And who wouldn't feel fed up when faced with this level of attrition? Every day new blows rain down on the prime minister and No 10, with his own MPs caught in the crossfire.

Just this afternoon, leaked official emails revealed the prime minister had personally intervened to help evacuate over 150 stray cats and dogs from Afghanistan.

This contradicted his on-camera claim that he hadn't stepped in to help Pen Farthing, founder of charity Nowzad, to secure safe passage for animals from Kabul at a time when fleeing Afghans were unable to board flights.

On Monday there were the new revelations of a No 10 gathering, complete with cake to celebrate the PM's birthday, during the first lockdown when such meetings were banned. Yesterday, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation into events at Downing Street after concluding parties crossed the threshold for a ""serious and flagrant"" breach of lockdown rules. Our prime minister now faces being questioned by the police, under caution or as a witness. Is there anything more unedifying than that?

But what MPs are really bracing for is the much-awaited Sue Gray report. There's no doubt its findings could trigger a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, which is why its publication has become such a pivotal moment for Boris Johnson and his government. Many MPs have publicly said they are holding their judgement over his future until they have seen this report.

""If Gray finds deliberate wrongdoing by Boris Johnson or any outright disregard of the rules, I think enough of my colleagues will say enough is enough and call for a vote of confidence,"" is how one former cabinet minister put it to me.

Boris Johnson and his allies know all too well the acute political danger he is in. A week ago, when he faced the cameras to answer accusations that he did know in advance about the 'Bring Your Own Booze' gathering in Downing Street on 20 May 2020, he looked defeated. Now in the kill zone, he's fighting - hard.

Image: Boris Johnson takes a drink of water during PMQs

And in recent days, the ""Save Boris"" operation has kicked into gear, organised by old allies - such as Conor Burns and Nigel Adams - and smart organisers, such as former deputy chief whip Chris Pincher and transport secretary Grant Shapps, who helped run the MPs operation for Mr Johnson's leadership bid back in July 2019.

In the Chamber on Wednesday you saw the operation in effect. Whereas last week Mr Johnson opened PMQs only to watch Bury South MP Christian Wakeford defect to Labour and see party grandee David Davis demand his resignation, this week Mr Johnson was enveloped by cheering colleagues and supportive interventions.

Arguably Mr Johnson's predicament has worsened since a week ago - new revelations and a police investigation - but he seems, for now, to be slightly less at sea.

""I think there is an increasing sense of perspective, especially considering the Ukranian situation and the rise of a new election with a new untested leader against one who recently won a majority of 80,"" said one senior minister who has been trying to shore up support for Mr Johnson. ""I think this is focusing minds.""

This is the tactic being used by Mr Johnson's team: to try to reassure waverers it's better the devil you know than the devil you don't, while reminding MPs the public will be unforgiving should the party be changing its a leader at a time of a possible overseas conflict and domestic cost-of-living crisis.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:38 Keir Starmer pressures Boris Johnson to resign over partygate scandal

One senior neutral backbencher told me they think the ""Save Boris"" operation is doing a good job. ""They are definitely steadying the ship. The question is now dividing into two parts: does Boris Johnson survive for now, given the prospect of replacing him too grizzly and draining? And then, does he lead us into the next election? If we save him now but he's still flatlining in a few months, well then that is a question for later in the year.""

But all of these efforts could come to nothing should the Sue Gray report deliver evidence that condemns the PM in the eyes of wavering MPs.

For all Mr Johnson's allies, there are plenty of opponents. It is known there's a lot of unease amongst the 50-strong One Nation Tories who were ostracised by this PM and this team over Brexit. This group doesn't operate as a unit and will take decisions individually, but it's fair to say a lot of them are thoroughly fed up with Mr Johnson. There is also the band of 2019-ers who were poised to put letters in last week and are now waiting to see what the Gray report says.

And for all the speculation about the report, no-one really knows what is in it apart from Sue Gray. We don't know when it will be delivered to Number 10, ready for publication, although the expectation is that it could come as early as tonight and certainly within the coming days. I'm told by government sources that Ms Gray is checking the report with lawyers, human resources and the Met Police to make sure what she sends to Downing Street can be published in full.

MPs will then have to decide whether they can fall in behind him or call for him to go. He's in the danger zone. The best he can hope for is to avoid a confidence vote, which will be triggered should 54 of his own MPs decide they've had enough and submit letters of no confidence.

But even if he can survive the coming weeks, can he ever really recover in the eyes of the public and his party? It was just over two years ago that Boris Johnson won a majority of 80. Now he's in office but not in power.

Following a meeting with clubs today, postponement guidance has been amended, after several matches were called off in December and January.

There have been 22 postponements in the Premier League under the COVID-19 criteria since the Omicron variant led to an increase in cases among players and staff at top-flight clubs.

The last match to be called off was the North London derby between Arsenal and Tottenham on 16 January, which drew criticism from Spurs.

Image: Arsenal succesfully applied for their match against Tottenham to be called off earlier in January

The Premier League accepted Mikel Arteta's sides request to postpone, with the club citing ""COVID, injuries and players away with their countries at AFCON"".

Tottenham said they were ""surprised"" by the league's decision, while Gary Neville said Arsenal's request should have been rejected.

Under the previous rules, where a club could not field 13 outfield players and a goalkeeper either from its squad list or its appropriately experienced under-21 players, the match would be postponed. At least one of the unavailable players had to have tested positive for COVID-19.

Now, at least four of the players absent and leaving a club with less than the minimum 14 eligible players must be positive COVID-19 cases.

It was announced on Monday that the number of positive COVID-19 cases in the Premier League had fallen for the fourth week in a row.

In the seven days up to and including 23 January, there were 16 new cases among players and staff, from 6,221 tests - the lowest number of infections in a week since 5 December.

The new guidance will come into effect ahead of the next round of Premier League fixtures, on 5 February.

Clubs criticised for taking 'advantage' of situation

In recent weeks, former Premier League players, including Sky Sports' pundits Jamie Carragher and Neville, have been vocal critics of the slew of postponements.

Speaking on Friday Night Football on the 14 January, both said that England's top clubs should stop using COVID-19 as an excuse to cancel games.

""I honestly believe that all teams, not just in the Premier League but the EFL now, must be made to play their fixtures,"" said Neville.

Image: Former Premier League players turned pundits, Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher, have criticised clubs for taking 'advantage' of the situation

""If it was purely down to COVID in extraordinary circumstances where there was 10 or 15 players out, but we're now talking about teams for the last few weeks where there's no doubt they've been calling games off based upon whether they think they've got the best squad or team to win a game. It's got to stop.

""Manchester United and other teams have got 30 to 40 players in their squad - I'm not having they can't get 13 to 16 players together.

""It has to stop now this and we have to make teams play.""

While Carragher said: ""If it's an outbreak of COVID and it's decimated the squad I can understand that, but players being in the AFCON tournament and just normal injuries, that's got nothing to do with it.

""You've got U23 squads and younger players, and this is an opportunity where they can get a chance.

""I know there's a lot riding on Premier League games but at this moment there's no doubt teams up and down this country are taking advantage of the situation.""

The updated league rules still allow the Premier League board to consider other factors when an application for a postponement is made, such as the status of any COVID-19 outbreak at a club and the proximity to the fixture in question, a club's ability to safely prepare for a match and any advice from the UK Healthy and Security Agency or other public health bodies.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220126190904/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-premier-league-clubs-agree-to-change-coronavirus-guidance-after-controversial-postponements-12525911;

At least one person has survived the capsizing in the Atlantic Ocean between the Bahamas and Florida after the suspected human smuggling operation went badly wrong during a storm several days ago.

He was taken to hospital suffering from dehydration and sun exposure after being found sitting on the hull, 45 miles east of Fort Pierce Inlet, by the crew of a merchant vessel early on Tuesday.

The man told his rescuers that he was in a group of 40 people who left the Bahamas island of Bimini on Saturday night.

He said the boat capsized in bad weather on Sunday morning and no-one had worn life jackets.

At the weekend, a small craft advisory had been issued for a severe cold front blowing through the dangerous passage with winds up to 23mph and swells up to three metres, according to the coastguard.

Crews on at least four ships and five aircraft have already scanned an area about the size of New Jersey, according to Captain Jo-Ann F Burdian.

They plan to continue searching throughout Wednesday before re-assessing the operation.

""We are using every piece of information we can to make sure we are exhausting our search efforts,"" Capt Burdian said.

""But we can't search forever.""

She also admitted ""the longer they remain in the water... exposed to the marine environment... with every moment that passes, it becomes much more dire and more unlikely"" that survivors would be found.

Bahamas is stepping stone to reach US

Migrants have long used the Bahamas as a stepping stone to reach Florida and the US.

They usually try to take advantage of breaks in the weather to make the crossing, but the vessels are often dangerously overcrowded and at risk of capsizing.

Court documents filed in New York show he has denied all allegations against him and ""hereby demands a trial by jury on all causes of action asserted in the complaint"".

Ms Giuffre accuses the Duke of York of forcing her to have sex more than two decades ago at a London home of convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell.

Earlier this month, following a judge's decision to allow Ms Giuffre's lawsuit to proceed, Buckingham Palace announced Andrew would have his military titles and patronages removed and would fight the case as a private individual.

The duke, 61, is being sued by Ms Giuffre, 38, formerly known as Virginia Roberts, in a US civil case. He has always strongly denied all the allegations against him.

In the 11-page document filed on Wednesday, lawyers for Andrew set out his response to Ms Giuffre's allegations.

It says he denies the allegation that he sexually abused her when she was under 18.

The document, submitted to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, also sets out a series of defences ""without assuming the burden of proof, and expressly denying any and all wrongdoing"".

It includes arguments that the claim should be dismissed because Ms Giuffre is a permanent resident of Australia and that by entering into the 2009 agreement with Jeffrey Epstein she ""waived the claims now asserted in the complaint"".

Russia has massed about 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border in recent weeks and is holding military drills at multiple locations in Russia, with similar exercises planned in neighbouring Belarus, which also borders Ukraine.

Moscow has denied it is planning an assault on Ukraine.

Washington has also made it clear that Russia's push for the Western alliance to pull back troops and weapons from eastern Europe is also a non-starter.

The top diplomat said the document stressed the US is standing by its often-stated positions - ""there is no change, there will be no change"".

He said the document, handed to officials in the Russian capital by the US ambassador, outlines a diplomatic path forward if the Kremlin chooses it, as America tries to avert a military offensive.

It contains a ""principled and pragmatic"" evaluation of Moscow's concerns and reflects that the US is open to dialogue.

Some 8,500 US troops have been put on heightened alert to go to eastern Europe to bolster NATO forces, but not to Ukraine itself.

NATO currently has about 4,000 troops in multinational battalions in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, backed by tanks, air defences and intelligence and surveillance units.

Analysis Mark Stone US correspondent @Stone_SkyNews The written document delivered to the Russian leadership by America's ambassador to Moscow is the written response to demands made by Russia weeks ago. Russia issued a highly unusual eight-point draft treaty in mid-December which effectively demanded a fundamental shift in Europe's defensive security measures. President Putin called for the removal of NATO troops and weapons from counties who joined NATO after 1997. He also called for an end to further NATO expansion, a demand which, if agreed to, would bring an end to the alliance's open door policy. It would amount to giving Russia a veto on NATO membership. Although the Americans won't release their document (they argue that private diplomacy has more chances of success) they have made clear that none of the Russian demands have been met. The Americans have simply repeated their willingness to discuss, in good faith, ways of mutually reducting arms in the region. Critics are arguing that America is simply dancing to Russia's tune by going along with a charade of document exchanges responding to undeliverable demands. The concern is that it gives the Russians time to prepare for an invasion. Of course it also gives the west time to hone their threatened sanctions, to bolster NATO defences in Europe, and to arm the Ukrainians.

NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has called on Russia to immediately de-escalate the situation.

Henry ""Michael"" Williams has been charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm after being accused of selling a weapon to Malik Faisal Akram just two days before the siege.

Akram, from Blackburn, used the gun when he entered Congregation Beth Israel in Colleysville, Texas, on 15 January.

He held the synagogue's rabbi and three others hostage while demanding the release of an al Qaeda suspect during a 10-hour stand-off with the FBI.

The rabbi then threw a chair at Akram and a SWAT team swarmed the place of worship, shooting the 44-year-old hostage-taker dead.

All of the victims survived the ordeal and were released unharmed.

Prosecutors say Williams, who has previously been convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and attempted possession of a controlled substance, sold Akram a semi-automatic pistol.

He initially told investigators that he recalled meeting a man with a British accent but did not remember his name.

Leon McCaskre, 41, was wanted for allegedly breaching a stalking restraint order and not turning up for a court hearing.

On Monday he attacked his ex-wife Yasmin Chkaifi, 43, stabbing her multiple times in a west London street, before a motorist drove into and killed him in an apparent attempt to stop the attack.

It is thought she might have been hit by the car, too.

The Metropolitan Police has referred itself to the police watchdog because of its previous contact with Ms Chkaifi.

The Independent Office for Police Complaints has been asked to investigate the force's previous contact with Ms Chkaifi to see if it could have done more to protect her.

The driver of the car, 26, was arrested on suspicion of murder and later bailed.

Some witnesses said he was among those who tried to help the woman but were threatened by the knifeman in Maida Vale at 9am on Monday.

He is then said to have got back into his car and appeared to use it to drive at the knifeman to try to stop the attack.

Ms Chkaifi's family reportedly hailed the car driver as ""our hero.""

Trudy Harrison, the prime minister's parliamentary private secretary (PPS), contacted the firm on 25 August - a few days before the operation to get Britons and eligible Afghans out of Kabul concluded - according to a charter employee who worked with her on the matter.

The employee said Ms Harrison, who is also the MP for Copeland, made clear to the company that she worked for the prime minister - repeatedly referring to ""the boss"".

The charter flight firm felt it was obvious her requests came with the prime minister's backing.

Ms Harrison was also keen to ensure members of the media were on the plane to watch the animals being evacuated to turn it into a good news story, the source at the company said.

When approached by Sky News, the MP confirmed that she did contact a number of companies to help with the evacuation effort ""as a constituency MP"" - however, none of her constituents were directly involved.

Ms Harrison admits she did tell staff she was PPS to the prime minister, but states Mr Johnson was not involved in any plans around evacuation.

""I was in touch with a whole raft of people and companies, there was a real focus on trying to be as helpful as possible in enabling organisations to understand government procedures and that's the case here,"" she told Sky News.

""I did this as a constituency MP at all times, but I am the prime minister's PPS so I will have made that clear.

""I had no conversations with the prime minister at any time about encouraging him to authorise or support in any way Pen Farthing and the team.

""I did speak to Ben Wallace and Ben told me in no uncertain terms that it was not possible to prioritise in this situation.""

Image: The UK government sponsored clearance for a charter flight, which sparked claims that animals had been prioritised over people

'PM had no role in individual evacuations'

The charter employee who worked with Ms Harrison told Sky News the MP introduced herself and said a Virgin Atlantic flight which had been lined up to help evacuate animals and people for the Nowzad charity had fallen through and she wanted help to find another flight.

They added that Ms Harrison told the firm the money was being provided by a private sponsor but she said her ""boss"" was very keen to make sure something happened to get the animals out quickly.

Animals that were being cared for in Afghanistan by Nowzad, run by Paul ""Pen"" Farthing, were eventually airlifted on a plane unrelated to the firm Ms Harrison contacted - with some staff evacuated by road routes.

Number 10 said the prime minister had ""no role"" in the evacuation of Nowzad staff and animals.

""The PM had no role in authorising individual evacuations from Afghanistan during Operation Pitting, including Nowzad staff and animals,"" a Number 10 spokesperson said.

""At no point did the PM instruct staff to take any particular course of action on Nowzad.""

Emails suggest Johnson did authorise animal rescue

The latest revelation comes after whistleblower emails raised further questions over Mr Johnson's insistence that he did not intervene to assist animal charities during the evacuation of Afghanistan.

Last December, the prime minister dismissed claims made by a former Foreign Office official that the government prioritised animals over people as ""complete nonsense"".

But new emails released by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, which is conducting an inquiry into the government's handling of the Afghanistan crisis, suggest Mr Johnson did personally authorise rescue efforts for pets and animals.

On 25 August 2021, an official working for Foreign Office minister Lord Goldsmith sent an email to the Foreign Office ""special cases"" team regarding the possible evacuation of an unnamed animal charity.

Ms Harrison's first contact with the charter company occurred on the same day - when she also emailed Mr Farthing ensuring him that his staff and animals could be evacuated.

Image: The PM's parliamentary private secretary Trudy Harrison sent a letter on 25 August assuring Pen Farthing that his staff and emails could be evacuated

Johnson 'played key role in evacuation'

Dominic Dyer, an animal welfare campaigner who worked with Pen Farthing, told Sky News the prime minister also got involved directly in the campaign to help evacuate Nowzad staff and animals on 25 August and this unblocked issues.

Mr Dyer, who lobbied the prime minister to evacuate Pen Farthing and his animals, said Mr Johnson ""played a key role in the evacuation operation"" and that the newly-released emails ""vindicate what I've been saying since August"" - that ""there were clear lines being given by senior officials that the prime minister was giving strong support to the project"".

In the Foreign Office letter, the official writes: ""Equivalent charity Nowzad, run by an ex-Royal Marine, has received a lot of publicity and the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated, [animal charity - name redacted] are hoping to be treated in the same capacity"".

""There was a direct trade-off between transporting Nowzad's animals and evacuating British nationals and Afghan evacuees, including Afghans who had served with British soldiers,"" he said.

This appears to support claims made last year in written evidence by whistleblower Raphael Marshall, a desk officer at the Foreign Office, that the department ""received an instruction from the prime minister"" to use ""considerable capacity"" to help animals leave the country that were being cared for by Nowzad.

Image: Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said at 'no point' was he told by the PM 'to evacuate Pen Farthing, his workforce or his pets'

Ministers dispute claim PM authorised evacuation of animals

Asked about this at the time, the PM said: ""No, that's complete nonsense.

""What I can tell you is that Operation Pitting, to airlift 15,000 people out of Kabul in the way that we did over the summer, was one of the outstanding military achievements of the last 50 years or more.""

Mr Farthing launched a campaign to get his staff and animals out of Afghanistan as the Taliban overran Kabul, using a plane funded through donations.

The UK government sponsored clearance for a charter flight, which sparked claims that animals had been prioritised over people.

Asked about the new emails, the PM's official spokesman said: ""It remains the case that the PM didn't instruct officials to take any particular course of action.""

On Wednesday, Lord Goldsmith tweeted: ""I did not authorise & do not support anything that would have put animals' lives ahead of peoples'.""

He added that he ""never discussed the Nowzad charity or their efforts to evacuate animals with the PM"".

While Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said ""at no point"" was he told by Mr Johnson to ""evacuate Pen Farthing, his workforce or his pets"".

Britain has been in talks with the US about potential deployments as concern mounts over what action Russian President Putin may take as he continues to mass tens of thousands of troops and weaponry around Ukrainian borders.

A Whitehall source stressed that no decision had yet been taken but that sending hundreds more British forces to ""eastern Europe"" was an option - ""one of many"".

A second Whitehall source said nothing had been signed off but confirmed a new deployment was possible, though they said it was still ""very much speculation"".

Such a move could be used as a last-ditch effort to make the Kremlin think twice if diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis fail because it would be the exact opposite of what Mr Putin has demanded.

He wants all NATO forces to withdraw from eastern and central European countries, saying their presence poses a security threat to Russia. NATO denies the claim.

It would also bolster protection for nervous eastern NATO member states that worry they could be next to face a Russian attack should President Putin decide to go on the offensive again in Ukraine.

CNN reported on Wednesday that the US and a handful of allies, including the UK, were in discussions to send thousands more personnel to eastern European NATO countries ahead of any potential further move into Ukraine by Russia.

Ukraine is not one of the alliance's 30 members but has said it would like to join - a desire that is one of the major flashpoints of friction between the West and Moscow.

France has offered to lead any new battlegroup in Romania

They would be similar to so-called Enhanced Forward Presence deployments in the three Baltic states and Poland.

These were founded in 2016 as part of NATO's move to bolster its defences and ability to deter Russian aggression after the Crimea annexation in 2014 and its backing of separatists in eastern Ukraine.

The UK leads the Estonia battlegroup, contributing about 800 servicemen and women. It also contributes some 150 troops to a US-led battlegroup in Poland.

It was not immediately possible to confirm this detail.

Sky News understands the report - which is being compiled by the senior civil servant - is still yet to have been sent to Number 10.

It is believed the delay is in part due to Ms Gray wanting to run the document past lawyers, HR and the Metropolitan Police to make sure the document can be published in full.

It was thought that on Wednesday a delicate checking process was being carried out to ensure a duty of care was being given to Downing Street staff who may be implicated in the report.

Uncertainty surrounds publication of Gray report

The prime minister has vowed to make a statement and answer questions in the House of Commons once the long-awaited Gray report has eventually been made public

Suggestions that this could happen on Wednesday afternoon were dealt a blow after the Commons adjourned almost three hours early, before 5pm.

Expectations had been raised that Boris Johnson would address the Gray report's findings in the Commons yesterday lunchtime.

PM fails to commit to publishing Gray report 'in full'

But along with questions regarding the timing of the report's publication, there is also speculation around just how much of Ms Gray's work will be made publicly available.

Yesterday, Mr Johnson failed to explicitly commit to publishing the full report once the findings of inquiry are finally received by Downing Street.

Asked at PMQs by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer if he will release the entirety of Ms Gray's report, the prime minister replied: ""We've got to leave the report to the independent investigator, as he knows, of course when I receive it, of course, I will do exactly what I said.""

Sir Keir said anything other than the document being published ""in full"" would amount to a ""cover up"".

Sky News understands Ms Gray wants the report to be published in full and it will cover all the alleged events, not just those the police are not investigating.

It is believed the Labour Party could try and use parliamentary procedures to try and force the publication of the document in full if the government choose not to do so.

Such an attempt could take the form of a ""humble address"", effectively a message to the Queen demanding the publication of papers.

Mr Johnson's spokesman said it is the government's ""intention"" to ""publish it as received"".

Explainer: Who is party investigator Sue Gray?

Also during PMQs, the prime minister told MPs he would not resign as he continued to dodge questions about the investigations into Downing Street parties.

In the third successive Wednesday session dominated by partygate, the PM admitted he would have to resign if found to have broken the ministerial code - but remained adamant that this was not the case.

Mr Johnson replied: ""Of course, but let me tell the House that I think he is inviting a question about an investigation which is - as you know, Mr Speaker, I cannot comment - and which he, as a lawyer, will know that I can't comment on.""

Sir Keir asked Mr Johnson whether, given he acknowledged the ministerial code applies to him, he would be resigning for misleading parliament over the partygate furore.

""No,"" the PM replied.

Met Police launch criminal investigation

The announcement by Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick that her force was investigating ""a number of events"" for potential breaches of COVID-19 regulations has placed more pressure on the PM.

But on Wednesday afternoon, Conservative MP Mark Logan told Sky News a ""change to the infrastructure around the prime minister"" was needed.

Six Nations chief executive Ben Morel said they would look to rearrange any games disrupted by COVID-19 at the earliest opportunity: ""What I've learned is that there is so much scenario planning you can do. You need to be ready for any kind of circumstances.

""What we will do is schedule any match at the soonest possible time. What that time is depends on many different circumstances. But hopefully everything will work as planned.""

The ""Heart of Gold"" singer made the decision after objecting to his songs being played on the same platform that offers Joe Rogan's podcast, which has been known to air vaccine-sceptical views.

""Spotify has become the home of life-threatening COVID misinformation,"" Young said on his website. ""Lies being sold for money.""

The streaming giant said it tried to achieve balance and had removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to COVID since the start of the pandemic.

""We want all the world's music and audio content to be available to Spotify users,"" the company said in a statement.

""With that comes great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators.""

It added: ""We regret Neil's decision to remove his music from Spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon.""

The Joe Rogan Experience podcast was acquired by Spotify in 2020, reportedly for more than $100 million (£77m).

Since then, it has grown to be the top-rated podcast on the platform.

The paintings, featuring elderly men and women, were commissioned by the Prince of Wales to serve as a lasting reminder of the horrors of the Nazi regime.

As the artwork was unveiled at the Queen's Gallery in London ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day, the heir to the throne was left moved by one survivor who rolled up her sleeve to reveal a concentration camp tattoo.

Lily Ebert, 98, also showed the prince a golden pendant she hid from camp guards in her shoe and her daily bread ration.

She told the prince: ""Meeting you, it is for everyone who lost their lives,"" and Charles replied: ""But it is a greater privilege for me,"" and touched her shoulder.

'Auschwitz took everything'

In July 1944, a 20-year-old Mrs Ebert, along with her mother and five siblings, were transported to Auschwitz.

Her parent and some of her siblings were condemned to death in the gas chamber after encountering the infamous Josef Mengele, notorious for his experiments on those in the camp, while the remaining family members were put to work.

Speaking about her pendant in the shape of an angel, she said: ""This necklace is very special. It went through Auschwitz and survived with me. Auschwitz took everything, even the golden teeth they took off people. But this survived.

""I put it in the heel of my shoe but the heel wore out so ... I put it every day in the piece of bread that we got to eat. So that is the story of it. I was five years old when I got it from my mother for my birthday.

""My mother did not survive. My little brother and little sister did not survive.

""They arrived and they saw Dr Mengele, he took them straight away. I have worn my necklace every day since I survived.""

A reminder of the 'depths of depravity' people can fall to

In the foreword for a catalogue accompanying the exhibition, Prince Charles wrote we are all ""responsible for one another, for our collective history"".

He added: ""One of the starkest reminders of this was the Holocaust, when a third of Europe's Jews were brutally murdered by the Nazi regime as it sought to extinguish not just the Jewish people, but Judaism.

Image: 'We are all responsible for one another, for our collective history'

""Seven portraits. Seven faces. Each a survivor of the horrors of those years, who sought refuge and a home in Britain after the war, becoming an integral part of the fabric of our nation.

""However, these portraits represent something far greater than seven remarkable individuals. They stand as a living memorial to the six million innocent men, women, and children whose stories will never be told, whose portraits will never be painted.""

The prince went on to say the portraits ""stand as a permanent reminder"" of the ""depths of depravity and evil humankind can fall to when reason, compassion and truth are abandoned.""

Who else is featured?

Also featured in the exhibition is a painting of Helen Aronson, who was among a group of around 750 people liberated from a Nazi-run ghetto in Poland out of 250,000 people sent there.

Ministers hope the Suffolk plant would increase the UK's long-term energy resilience, and that nuclear power will boost Britain's energy security in the face of volatile gas prices.

""We need to ensure Britain's future energy supply is bolstered by reliable, affordable, low carbon power that is generated in this country,"" said Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng.

New nuclear will not only ""insure greater energy independence,"" but ""create high-quality jobs and drive economic growth"", he said.

Nuclear power can generate electricity without the climate-heating pollution associated with burning fossil fuels like gas, and is a part of the government's strategy to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

But ""more renewables will help to bring bills down more quickly and are quicker to build while employing people right across the UK,"" said Jess Ralston from energy think tank ECIU.

The price of wind and solar power has fallen dramatically in recent years.

""In light of current volatile gas prices affecting bills at least for the next few years, it will surely be a priority for the government to look at how they can reduce bills,"" added Ms Ralston. ""Ways to significantly reduce the costs of new nuclear would need to be found.""

Simone Rossi, CEO of EDF, said the funding help protect the UK from energy shocks, lower energy costs and boost jobs.

'Tacit admission'

Negotiations between the Government and EDF, the project developer, began last year. Ministers hope the cash will help progress the plans and attract more cash from private investors.

Greenpeace UK said handing out taxpayers' money was a ""tacit admission"" that nuclear was not commercially viable.

If built, Sizewell C could power the equivalent of about six million homes and support up to 10,000 jobs in Suffolk and across the UK. The plant will be a ""near replica"" of Hinkley Point C in Somerset.

Unions welcomed the step forward, but Unite urged the government to ""take the handbrake off"" and ""agree a funding model that allows Sizewell to start without any further delay"".

The government has committed to bringing at least one large-scale nuclear project to a final investment decision in this Parliament, as long as it provides ""value for money"".

The rules introduced over the Christmas period due to the rise of the Omicron variant have lapsed.

The other nations in the UK are also moving to less stringent restrictions, but are not opening up to the level of England.

The advice for pupils and staff to wear masks in classrooms was removed on 20 January, and work from home advice eased on 19 January.

From 27 January in England Events and venues will no longer be required by law to use the NHS COVID pass - but can still use on a voluntary basis

Face coverings no longer legally required by law in any setting, except public transport in London where they will remain mandatory. Public health guidance will continue to advise using face coverings in “crowded and enclosed spaces”

Masks will no longer be advised by the Department for Education to be worn in communal areas - although local directors of public health have some leeway to reintroduce measures

Any local introduction of face coverings must be routinely reviewed and “removed at the earliest possibility”

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""The tireless efforts of NHS and care staff, and the army of volunteers, as well as the phenomenal response of the British public means over 37 million people have been boosted. I want to thank everyone who has come forward to get boosted now.

""Our vaccines, testing and antivirals ensure we have some of the strongest defences in Europe and are allowing us to cautiously return to Plan A, restoring more freedoms to this country.

""As we learn to live with COVID we need to be clear eyed that this virus is not going away so if you haven't already - please come forward for your first, second or booster jab.""

Face coverings will still be mandatory on Transport for London services.

And supermarkets Sainsbury's and Waitrose will be asking people to continue wearing masks in their shops.

On Tuesday this week, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced that, from 4am on 11 February, there will be no requirement for vaccinated passengers arriving in England to do post-arrival lateral flow tests.

Those who are not fully vaccinated - two jabs, or a single Janssen jab - will need to test before they depart for England, and take a post-arrival PCR test, and complete a passenger locator form.

But they will no longer need to isolate, or complete a day eight test.

Crowds are set to return to Welsh sporting events in the next fortnight, and nightclubs will also reopen.

Nightclubs reopened this week in Northern Ireland, although a domestic COVID certificate was still required for entry.

Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: ""The recent decline in community case rates and individuals requiring hospitalisation is encouraging and it's thanks to the public, who have taken up vaccination and followed the Plan B measures closely, that we've got to this point.

""However we should not be complacent. The pandemic is not over yet and we will need to remain cautious to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.

""I encourage everyone to get the vaccine as soon as they can, to continue testing regularly with lateral flow tests - particularly before periods of high risk and before seeing anyone who is vulnerable - and to take a PCR test if they have symptoms.""

An interesting bit of analysis from Nick Hargrave, a former Downing Street adviser to both David Cameron and Theresa May.

In a length Twitter thread, he effectively suggests Boris Johnson will likely survive the coming weeks - but at a significant cost.

He writes: ""Often said that Tory MPs are the most sophisticated electorate in the world. If only it were so. In reality most are risk averse, career minded and swayed by the psychology of the crowd.



""For all his failings, the Prime Minister knows this and has a keener sense of human frailty then many.""



Mr Hargrave says Mr Johnson's last two PMQs appearances were ""all about the projection of strength and not giving a toss, mixed with a Johnsonian dollop of humour to diffuse the earnest.""

""His subtext is clear,"" he says.

""I'm not going anywhere no matter how bad it gets. You didn't elect me for ethics. So to get me out you're going to have to take me out.""

He suggests that Cabinet members realise they ""probably won't win a leadership election"".

Mr Hargrave concludes: ""Obviously you are heavily wounded and months ahead a s***show Inc more leaks. Labour pleased. But you live to fight another day and gamble Labour's political operation nowhere near 1990s levels of instinct.

Angel Lynn was found lying with catastrophic injuries in the carriageway of the A6 near Loughborough on 17 September 2020.

The 19-year-old was taken to hospital where she has remained ever since, now requiring round-the-clock care.

On Wednesday, Chay Bowskill was found guilty of kidnap, coercive and controlling behaviour, and perverting the course of justice.

The 20-year-old, of Empingham Drive, Syston, was sentenced to a total of seven and a half years in prison.

A second 20-year-old man, Rocco Sansome, was also found guilty of kidnap and handed a 21-month long sentence.

As part of the trial at Leicester Crown Court, jurors were shown disturbing footage of the moment Bowskill chased down Miss Lynn and bundled her inside a silver van.

The vehicle, which was being driven by a Sansome, then sped off and at some point in the journey, Miss Lynn fell out of the vehicle as it travelled along the A6.

She was later discovered by a passer-by who contacted Leicestershire Police.

'I will never get to walk my daughter down the aisle'

Following the result of the court case, Miss Lynn's family issued a heart-breaking statement saying their ""lives have changed beyond recognition forever"".

Her father Paddy Lynn said: ""Angel was so full of life and had such a great future ahead of her. That future has sadly been taken away from her.

""The catastrophic injuries Angel suffered will mean life will never be the same for her or our family. Every day is not only a huge struggle for Angel but also a huge struggle for our family and friends.""

He added: ""We try to remain strong but we know that every day will be difficult and a struggle for us all, especially for Angel.

""I know that Angel will never get married now and I will never get to walk my daughter down the aisle.

""Nikki and I will never be grandparents to Angel's children. We don't know what the future holds for our daughter but we try to put smiles on our faces each day but inside our hearts are bleeding out.""

Commenting after the sentencing of Bowskill and Sansome, Detective Chief Inspector Tony Harward said no verdict ""can make up for the quality of life this young woman has lost"".

1827;1827;Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee: New series Pam & Tommy and the story of the ultimate sex tape scandal;Thursday 27 January 2022 03:32, UK;[];['lily james', 'pamela anderson'];['sex', 'anderson', 'tommy', 'tape', 'scandal', 'series', 'pam', 'lee', 'hilton', 'narrative', 'ultimate', 'know', 'internet', 'pamela'];"Rather than a wedding band, Pamela Anderson had Tommy Lee's name tattooed on her ring finger, the inking marking a commitment made just 96 hours into their wild romance.

It was February 1995 when the nuptials took place, the ultimate Baywatch babe swapping her famous red swimsuit for a white string bikini to marry the Motley Crue rocker on a beach in Cancun, Mexico.

Anderson and Lee very quickly became a 1990s tabloid dream; the Playboy pin-up and the tattooed bad boy, a couple who couldn't keep their hands off each other - and weren't afraid to let people (journalists and photographers included) know about it.

Read more: Baywatch: Revisiting the '90s dream - and difficulties - with the stars

By the end of the year, Anderson was pregnant with their first child and details of the sex tape that would soon become infamous had emerged. The theft of the private tape, filmed during the couple's honeymoon and stolen from their home in Malibu, California, by a disgruntled contractor, left the Baywatch star ""devastated"".

Despite the couple's efforts to curtail it once they found it was gone, the tape snowballed. Coinciding with the early days of the internet, the footage went from underground bootleg-VHS curiosity to full-blown global headline-maker, the first celebrity sex tape to go viral.

When sex tapes featuring Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian came out in later years, the narrative was the same: the women were laughed at, vilified; the men were deemed sex gods. Given the fame it brought them, questions were raised about whether the footage had been leaked by the subjects themselves. And the videos became known as the Pamela Anderson sex tape, the Paris Hilton sex tape, the Kim Kardashian sex tape; in Hilton and Kardashian's cases, do you even remember the names of the men involved? (Bizarrely, Rick Salomon, who made the tape with Hilton, later went on to marry Anderson).

Years later, the subject of her own tape inevitably comes up whenever Anderson is interviewed. She has never watched it, never made any money off it herself - despite others reportedly making millions - she tells interviewers, sometimes laughing off their jokes about it. She was an actress and model who had posed naked and spoken openly about her sex life; for years, she was fair game.

The leaking of a tape like this now would be considered revenge porn. Watching some of those clips in 2022 brings about a similar sense of unease evoked by the footage of inappropriate questioning in old Britney Spears interviews, which came to the fore as her conservatorship fight made headlines last year.

Post #MeToo, the world views stories such as this very differently now. And yet, Anderson and Lee's story is being dramatised in the new series Pam & Tommy, starring Lily James and Sebastian Stan and billed as ""a love story, crime caper and cautionary tale rolled into one"".

Anderson has had no involvement in the series. Which begs the question: why is the story being retold for entertainment, almost 30 years later?

James, who is usually associated with ""English rose"" roles in shows and films such as Downton Abbey and Rebecca, has been transformed beyond recognition to become the all-American (well, Canadian) bombshell. In interviews, she has spoken of the ""misogyny"" Anderson was faced with and how women have always been held to much higher standards than men.

But after making tabloid headlines herself in 2020, when she was linked to her married The Pursuit Of Love co-star Dominic West, she must know all too well what it is like having your personal life gossiped about by the world.

Director Craig Gillespie, known for films including I, Tonya and Cruella, says the aim was to change the narrative, to shine a spotlight on how Anderson and Lee (to a much lesser extent), were treated at the time and present the story in ""a much kinder"" way.

""[People] don't realise what victims they were,"" he tells Sky News. ""This was a deeply personal tape. It wasn't [just] a sex tape, it was an hour-and-a half-long, like all of their relationship and some beautiful moments and happened to have [a few] minutes of explicit stuff on there that was in a safe, in a garage, at their home. And then this happens and with no accountability from anyone.""

Image: Director Craig Gillespie says he hopes the show changes the narrative of the story from the misogyny of the 1990s

On Anderson not being involved, he says: ""I just have to respect however she wants to feel about it... In my heart, I felt like we were doing a really empathetic portrayal of what was happening and the victimisation that had happened with them and just how heinous it was, so I thought it was something that was a real opportunity to change the narrative and the perspective of what happened back then... Looking at it through today's lens was a really unique opportunity.""

Gillespie also says Anderson and Lee's story ""colliding"" with the rise of the internet makes for a ""powerful commentary"" on society and how the way we consume news and information has changed.

""[It was] like the beginning of this obsession with the internet and how we're so complicit. It's like there's no accountability for how we consume this, you know, almost like the internet is our get out of jail free card. So it was fascinating. And the way that we get to come into this story with preconceived notions...

""We have those judgements as we come into the show, we think we know what we thought we knew from what we saw back then, and we see how sort of incredibly wrong we were, and so quick to judge and to consume these soundbites and formulate an opinion that destroyed people's lives.""

The series does address the misogyny. ""I'm on that tape, same as you,"" Stan's Lee tells James's Anderson in one scene. ""No, not like me you're not,"" she replies.

But is it enough to warrant bringing it all back? Like the tape itself, no doubt millions will be watching.

Lee's representatives declined to comment when contacted by Sky News. Anderson's representatives did not respond to requests for comment, although according to sources quoted in US reports she has said she won't be watching and finds the idea of the series ""painful"".

It will be interesting to see if the ""kinder"" approach changes her mind - but once again, the story is out there without her consent.

The catalogue of collectable stamps - worth £5,000 - was snatched from a 72-year-old man in Enfield, north London.

He has been ""deeply affected"" by the ""cowardly"" attack, which happened as he walked through an alleyway from Canning Square to Magpie Close, Scotland Yard said on Thursday.

The suspect, described as an olive-skinned male wearing a hooded top, walked past the pensioner before turning and grabbing him from behind at around 10.20pm on 10 December 2020.

He rifled through the victim's pockets and took his wallet which contained his Freedom Pass and debit card. He also stole his mobile phone, an umbrella and the stamp collection.

Detective Constable William Darko said: ""This was a cowardly offence committed against a vulnerable elderly gentleman who has been deeply affected by the incident.

""Sadly, we are well aware that the effects of becoming a victim of robbery can run far deeper than a loss of property.

""I know that some time has passed since this incident occurred and urge anyone who was offered the stamps for sale, or bought the stamps, to contact police immediately.

""If you don't want to speak directly to police, call Crimestoppers - but please do make the call.""

1830;1830;COVID-19: Changes to periods from coronavirus vaccines 'small' and quickly reverse' says expert;Thursday 27 January 2022 04:04, UK;[];['covid-19', 'coronavirus'];['vaccines', 'change', 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'changes', 'women', 'study', 'small', 'male', 'expert', 'cycle', 'quickly', 'following', 'periods', 'reverse', 'vaccine', 'womans'];"Any changes to a woman's period following a COVID-19 vaccine are ""small"" and go on to ""quickly reverse"", according to an expert.

More than 36,000 women reported changes to their periods to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) following a jab.

Writing in The BMJ - formerly known as the British Medical Journal - Dr Victoria Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, said the latest evidence showed changes to cycles are ""limited but reassuring"".

Dr Male also highlighted that periods can vary naturally.

She drew attention to a study carried out in the US which showed the first dose of a vaccine was not linked to a change in timing of a woman's next period.

After a second dose, there was an average delay of 0.45 days.

The greatest changes were faced by women who had two doses of a vaccine within one cycle, who faced an average delay of 2.32 days.

This scenario is unlikely in the UK, as longer periods between jabs are advised.

The study found that any change in length to someone's cycle returned to normal after a couple of months.

A separate study from Norway asked women about changes to the periods both before and after vaccination.

Some 38% of women reported changes after getting a first dose.

The study did identify heavier than normal bleeding as the change most associated with vaccination.

Dr Male wrote: ""The findings from both these studies are reassuring: changes to the menstrual cycle do occur following vaccination, but they are small compared with natural variation and quickly reverse.""

She added: ""The MHRA says that current evidence does not support a link between changes to menstrual periods and COVID vaccination in the UK, and it continues to advise that anyone noticing a change to their periods that persists over several of cycles, or who has any new vaginal bleeding after the menopause, be treated according to the usual clinical pathways.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127111004/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-changes-to-periods-from-coronavirus-vaccines-small-and-quickly-reverse-says-expert-12525750;

In our first few days in Herat, we've met whole families who've sold their kidneys so they can eat.

In one case, three brothers and their two sisters told us they flogged their organs for around £1,150 a piece to buy food for the rest of the family.

We've sat with a mother grieving over her toddler who starved to death. We've heard multiple parents tell us how they're now resorting to selling their children.

Yes, selling them.

And we've spoken to emotional doctors who tell us they can't afford even the dressings for infected wounds nor the basic tools to do life-saving operations.

This is Afghanistan post-pull out for foreign troops. This is the country in which a coalition of nations spent 20 years, shelling out billions of dollars to ""rebuild it"".

This is the nation where so many lives were sacrificed - thousands - both foreign troops and ordinary Afghans.

Image: One woman shows the scar from surgery to remove a kidney

This is the part of the world which the United Nations now says is fast becoming the centre of the globe's worst humanitarian disaster.

Afghanistan was poor and in difficulties before the chaotic withdrawal of foreign troops last August.

Now, with the Taliban in power and the rest of the world still not officially recognising the legitimacy of their government, it's the Afghan people who're having to resort to ever more extreme measures to survive.

The desperation in communities

In a small village community outside Herat, we saw the desperation and desolation of poverty.

We're concealing the exact location of the village and protecting the identities of all the villagers who spoke to us for their own safety. Our arrival along with the village elder prompted streams of people to come out of their mud houses and tents.

Within minutes, old women were thrusting medical documents into our hands pleading with us for help while mothers clutching babies begged us for food.

Image: The humanitarian situation is getting truly desperate for millions of Afghans. Pic: Chris Cunningham

Rows of people of varying ages and with a variety of chronic diseases and disabilities were lined up for us to see - each one with a relative urging us to somehow deliver some hope and relief to them.

This area seems to us utterly barren, with no water or shrubbery for miles around. In many cases the only currency these families have is their organs - and with so many having already resorted to selling them, it's now their young who're being put on the market.

We spoke to a mother and father who've both sold their kidneys.

All they'd got left to sell now was one of their eight children - so they were thinking the unthinkable. The 25-year-old mother told us: ""About six months ago, my three-year-old son died of hunger. I can't see them all lose their lives... at least this way, someone else will feed them.""

Image: Alex Crawford talks to mother and father who have already sold their kidneys and are now thinking of selling a child because their situation is so desperate. Pic: Chris Cunningham

Her voice was breaking with emotion as she told us. Her husband told us he hadn't yet decided which child to sell but such was their desperation he would sell the child off for less than the price of his kidney.

""We have nothing left to sell,"" he said. ""We have to sell our children now and I'm prepared to do this for even 20,000 Afghanis (about £150 or $200). I can't go to sleep every night with them crying that they are hungry.""

Taliban say it is a 'myth'

The Taliban says this is all a Western myth, dreamed up by evil, dishonest Western media to discredit them.

They also say all girls in the country are in education, that schools and universities are all open and they're not rounding up female activists or carrying out vendettas against those who worked with the foreign troops once stationed here for two decades.

Image: Taliban at a checkpoint. Pic: Chris Cunningham

The Taliban appear to have ""alternative facts"" to what many others are living through on the ground in Afghanistan.

The rapid withdrawal of foreign troops in August saw the Taliban sweep into power. The international community imposed sanctions and billions of dollars-worth of assets were frozen in overseas bank accounts, mostly American.

It's meant the economy has virtually collapsed with few jobs and very little hard currency available for ordinary Afghans.

The lack of worldwide recognition of the Taliban government has meant a country which was previously almost wholly dependent on foreign aid has seen that all but dry up.

And respect for women's' rights has repeatedly been cited by global donors as a condition for restoring that aid.

But the dilemma for the international community is trying to balance the pressure exerted on the Taliban to respect human rights, against the obvious and deepening suffering of the Afghan people.

The little aid which is seeping in is not nearly adequate for the millions who need it.

Hospitals run out of treatments

So, in the Herat Regional Hospital in Herat City, we found doctors like Dr Mohammad Aqel Halimee emotional and tearful over not even having enough dressings to bandage his young patients in the children's ward of the hospital's burns unit.

Image: Doctor Mohammad Aqel Halimee from Herat Hospital burns unit talks to Alex Crawford. Pic: Chris Cunningham

Many have badly infected injuries caused by deep burns from open fires which families use to try to keep warm in mid-winter.

But with most parents unable to pay for the medicines or bandages, never mind expensive surgeries, their children are often sent home to die.

Dr Aqel said the medics suffer badly from the emotional toll taken on them.

""I have a bad sensation,"" he said. ""Because (it's all down to the) lack of materials... I have the ability to treat them but lack of materials and bandages means I can't help them.""

Many kidney buyers from across border

In the village community on the outskirts of Herat city, I was allowed into a room to see a group of women who'd all sold their kidneys.

In this highly conservative society, they wouldn't even show their faces in public, never mind their bare midriffs - but they allowed me to film them so long as their faces weren't shown.

Many of them were still teenagers or in their early twenties and already had multiple children. I noticed a number of them were pregnant again.

But there's a lucrative kidney trade in this area with the region's proximity to the Iranian border and many of the buyers are from across the border - and this extreme poverty has driven more Afghans onto the operating tables to try to wipe out debts and provide food for their families.

Image: A group of women from the same village who have all sold a kidney for money. Pic: Chris Cunningham

Since the Taliban came into power, there's apparently been a clamping down on kidney transplants but our investigations seem to indicate this has just sent the trade deeper underground.

Many were nervous about talking to us about it because of fears over repercussions from the Taliban who are attempting to portray a certain image to the outside world.

'We have no choice'

One teenage mother told us she'd been operated on about a month ago.

The angry, red weal of her scar seemed to back this up.

""We have no choice,"" she said, ""We do this to feed our children.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:43 How did the Taliban pay for the takeover?

There are so many of them heading into the city for operations, they complain its driven down the organ price - only 150,000 Afghanis (£1,150 or $1,500) for the women compared to earlier payments of 200,000 Afghanis (£1,500 or $2,000) for the men.

The village elder did his best to try to persuade the couple not to sell any of their children, a number of whom were sitting with us listening to this discussion.

And then he turned to us.

1833;1833;Milky Way discovery as astronomers uncover 'spooky' spinning object unlike anything seen before;Thursday 27 January 2022 10:43, UK;[];['space'];['discovery', 'team', 'unlike', 'spooky', 'milky', 'saidthe', 'star', 'observations', 'ms', 'object', 'uncover', 'radio', 'astronomers', 'spinning', 'seen', 'way', 'hurleywalker'];"Astronomers have discovered a mysterious spinning object in the Milky Way that emits a radio wave beam every 18 minutes - and is unlike anything seen before.

The object has been observed to release a huge burst of radio energy for a whole minute every 18 minutes.

Researchers estimate that it is around 4,000 light years away and could be a new class of slowly rotating neutron star with an ultra-powerful magnetic field that can be detected by radio telescopes.

The observation is known as a radio transient, which refers to an object that periodically releases brief flashes of radio signals, as if it is switching on and off in space.

'Spooky' discovery

""It was kind of spooky for an astronomer because there's nothing known in the sky that does that,"" said Natasha Hurley-Walker, of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research at Curtin University, who led the team that made the discovery.

Image: The star icon shows the position of the mysterious repeating transient in the Milky Way, as viewed by Earth

While the occurrences have been seen before - usually as very quick events that flash on and off within seconds or milliseconds or as longer pulses that last days - radio transients had not previously been detected appearing and disappearing over a few hours, Ms Hurley-Walker said.

The team is carrying out more research to figure out what is causing the bursts of energy, but the astronomers think it could be a so-called magnetar, which is a special type of ""dead"" star with an ultra-strong magnetic field.

Ms Hurley-Walker said the prospect of a repeating radio signal in space may cause some to think it could be a dispatch from aliens, but she said the observations spanned a wide range of frequencies - indicating that they have a natural origin.

First discovered by a student

Former undergraduate student at Curtin University, Tyrone O'Doherty, first discovered the object by looking at Milky Way observations from March 2018 and May 2018 and searching for any differences.

He said he hadn't expected to make such a fascinating discovery, telling a news briefing: ""It really feels quite surreal to have found something like this.""

To confirm the discovery, Ms Hurley-Walker sifted through extensive archives stretching back to 2013, to see whether the telescope had picked up any other activity from the object.

She found that it had switched on in the first part of 2018, emitting 71 flashes of radio signals from January until March, before switching off again. As she and her colleagues saw in their own observations, the pulses came at regular intervals.

""It's just every 18.18 minutes, like clockwork,"" she said.

Unleashing further details will require observing the object when it is active again or finding similar objects elsewhere in the Milky Way, Ms Hurley-Walker said.

The team also found that the newly detected object appears to be spinning much more slowly than other magnetars, suggesting it has outlived others that usually last only a few thousand years.

But Ms Hurley-Walker said it could also be an entirely new type of cosmic object that caused the flashes of energy.

""Because we didn't expect this kind of radio emission to be possible, the fact that it exists tells us that some kind of extreme physical processes must be happening,"" she said.

The researchers detailed the finding in a study published this week in the journal Nature.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127111004/http://news.sky.com/story/milky-way-discovery-as-astronomers-uncover-spooky-spinning-object-unlike-anything-seen-before-12526377;

It follows the arrest of two men in their 30s yesterday as part of the ongoing investigation into the incident that took place last week.

The second man has been released from custody.

The man who was charged is scheduled to appear before Carlow District Court this morning.

Peadar Doyle, 66, was brought to the post office in Co Carlow last Friday by two men and reportedly carried up to the counter.

When the group approached, a ""concerned staff member enquired about the wellbeing of the man being propped up"", the Irish Times said.

At that point, the two men ""dropped the man and left the post office"", it was reported.

Staff then apparently attended to the man and found he had died.

According to RTE, a man initially called into the post office on Staplestown Road in Carlow town to collect a pension on behalf of an elderly man.

But he was reportedly told that the recipient had to be present, and two men arrived a short time later with the deceased.

No money was handed over, the Irish Independent said.

Earlier this week, a man named Declan Haughney admitted to the Irish Mirror that he was one of the men who took Mr Doyle, apparently his uncle, to the post office, but insisted he had not realised he had died.

He claimed he and another man took Mr Doyle on a five-minute walk from his home on Pollerton Road, Carlow, to collect his pension last Friday morning.

The 40-year-old said he had lived with his uncle throughout his life and believes he may have died on the way to Hosey's post office on Staplestown Road.

He said he and another man linked arms with him and dragged him to the post office.

""He was walking like normal and then I reckon he died,"" he said, adding that Mr Doyle started ""dragging his heels"" at one point.

""We were grand like then all of a sudden he started going all slumpy,"" he said.

""We thought nothing of it because Peadar had had heart attacks and all.""

The Irish Times previously reported that police believe Mr Doyle died before his body reached the post office at 11am.

Foul play has reportedly been ruled out but a post-mortem was only able to estimate the time of death as some time on Friday morning.

Andrew vehemently denies the allegations, with his lawyers describing them as ""baseless"" and suggesting his accuser may suffer from ""false memories"".

His legal team have now also published a detailed document outlining his defence.

Here, Sky News looks at who's who in the Giuffre-Andrew case and who has been called as witnesses.

Accuser

Virginia Giuffre

Image: Virginia Giuffre is now 38 and lives in Australia

Virginia Giuffre, now 38, was known as Virginia Roberts at the time she alleges she was the victim of ""sexual assault and battery"" at the hands of Prince Andrew.

She met Ghislaine Maxwell in 2000 in Florida, where she grew up. Ms Giuffre alleges Maxwell recruited her for her boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.

Ms Giuffre, who was 17 at the time, claims she was flown to London in 2001 and made to have sex with Prince Andrew after a night out at Tramp nightclub in Mayfair.

A now-famous photograph of the pair together at Maxwell's Belgravia home is alleged to have been taken on that night.

Image: Prince Andrew and a young Virginia Roberts pictured in a photo believed to have been taken in 2001. Pic: Rex/Shutterstock

She also claims the same thing happened at Epstein's New York mansion and private Caribbean island Little St James.

Ms Giuffre was referenced several times in Maxwell's sex trafficking trial last year but was not one of the four victims who gave evidence.

She signed a confidential agreement with Epstein in 2009 that saw him give her $500,000 in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

Prince Andrew's legal team tried to use it to get her latest lawsuit thrown out as it said ""any other person"" should not face future litigation, but the argument was thrown out by the judge.

Defendant

Prince Andrew

Image: Prince Andrew, 61, will face a civil trial in the US between September and December

The Duke of York, 61, is not facing criminal charges, but is instead facing a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre at the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In his 2019 Newsnight interview, Andrew denied ever meeting Ms Giuffre and said that on the night she claims the first assault took place, he took his daughter Princess Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking before returning home.

He also said he could not be sure the photo of the pair of them had not been edited.

Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him, with the most recently revealed court documents claiming Ms Giuffre may suffer from ""false memories"".

His team argue this is evidenced by the fact that ""the circumstances under which (he) allegedly assaulted her have repeatedly changed over the years"".

They claim the lawsuit is ""in an effort to deflect from her own participation"" in Epstein's scheme.

Andrew is not facing any legal action in the UK. The Metropolitan Police reviewed a document in the US civil case, but in October 2021 the force said that had been completed.

The US lawsuit is being brought under legislation in New York that allows victims of alleged child abuse to launch cases long after the normal legal window for prosecution.

Jeffrey Epstein

Image: Jeffrey Epstein was jailed in 2008 and 2019

Prince Andrew told BBC Newsnight in 2019 that he met Jeffrey Epstein in 1999 through their mutual friend Ghislaine Maxwell.

This was reiterated in his recent legal defence document, which says they met ""in or around 1999"".

In the now-famous 2019 Newsnight interview he admitted to flying on Epstein's private plane, staying on his private island and inviting him to both Windsor Castle and Sandringham.

Epstein, a billionaire financier, was charged with soliciting prostitution from underage girls in 2008 and served a short prison sentence after negotiating a plea deal.

Image: Maxwell and Epstein are pictured together before his death

Andrew confirmed he stayed at Epstein's New York mansion for several days in 2010 - after his conviction - but told the BBC it was when he cut ties with him. ""It was a convenient place to stay,"" he said.

His legal defence in the Giuffre case states it is not true that he was a ""frequent guest in Epstein's various homes around the world"".

It also claims that Ms Giuffre's civil lawsuit against him is void due to the $500,000 agreement she made with Epstein in 2009. This argument was previously thrown out by the judge.

Epstein, 66, killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested again the previous month on suspicion of further sex trafficking offences.

Ghislaine Maxwell

The daughter of the late media tycoon Robert Maxwell, Ghislaine lived, worked and travelled with Jeffrey Epstein through the 1990s and early 2000s.

They are believed to have dated in 1991, but stayed close after the break-up, after which she began recruiting underage girls for him.

She is believed to have met Virginia Giuffre in Florida in 2000, when she is alleged to have trafficked her for Epstein.

Ms Giuffre has never formally taken legal action against Maxwell, but she was referenced several times in the socialite's trial last year.

Her London home is where Ms Giuffre alleges the first sexual assault by Prince Andrew took place and she appears in the background of a photograph thought to have been taken that night.

Following her ex-boyfriend's death in 2019, she was arrested at her New Hampshire home by the FBI and jailed in New York.

After a trial she was last year convicted of multiple counts of sex trafficking underage girls for Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s.

She faces decades in prison as she awaits sentencing.

Witnesses for Andrew

Robert Giuffre

Prince Andrew's legal team has requested to hear evidence from Virginia Giuffre's husband Robert from Australia where the couple live.

Court documents claim that Mr Giuffre is likely to have information about his wife's ""alleged emotional and psychological harm"".

They want to question him about her relationship to Epstein and Maxwell and any role she may have had ""recruiting underage girls"" for Epstein.

Prince Andrew's lawyer says Mr Giuffre met his wife in Thailand in 2002 while she was training to be a massage therapist - at Epstein's expense.

His legal team allege she was involved in ""recruiting one or more women to perform sexual acts for Jeffrey Epstein - who funded the trip"".

Dr Judith Lightfoot

The other witness sought by Prince Andrew's side is Dr Judith Lightfoot, Virginia Giuffre's psychologist.

His legal team says she has ""relevant information"" about Ms Giuffre's ""alleged abuse by Epstein and Maxwell, childhood abuse and trauma, and claimed emotional and psychological harm and damages"".

Melissa Lerner, Andrew's Los Angeles-based lawyer, says that ""Dr Lightfoot's records (or lack thereof) reflecting (Ms Giuffre's) allegations against (Andrew) is relevant to preparation of his defence for trial"".

The duke's lawyers want her ""opinion"" on Ms Giuffre's emotional state and any ""theory of false memories"".

Court papers request notes from ""all sessions"" with Ms Giuffre, as well as any prescriptions she issued.

Dr Lightfoot is also resident in Australia and is being asked to provide testimony from there by 29 April.

Witnesses for Virginia Giuffre

Shukri Walker

Virginia Giuffre's legal team has requested evidence from a woman called Shukri Walker.

She claims to have seen Prince Andrew ""with a young girl"" at Tramp nightclub in London ""around the time that [the] plaintiff contends he abused her in London"" after visiting the venue.

Court documents state: ""Because Prince Andrew has denied ever meeting [the] plaintiff or being at Tramp nightclub during the relevant time period, Ms Walker's testimony is highly relevant"".

Ms Walker's lawyer is Lisa Bloom, who has also represented several of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged victims.

Ms Bloom previously told The Guardian that Ms Walker ""remembers the night clearly because she never saw a royal before or since"".

Ms Walker has been requested to submit evidence through a deposition to the Royal Courts of London.

Robert Olney

Ms Giuffre's lawyers have also requested evidence from Robert Olney, who previously worked as Prince Andrew's equerry - or assistant.

Court documents state: ""Plaintiff has reason to believe that Mr Olney has relevant information about Prince Andrew's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, as Mr Olney's name appears in publicly available copies of Epstein's phone book (or 'Black Book').""

The ""black book"" also contained the details of a string of high-profile figures, including Prince Andrew, former US President Donald Trump and Bill Clinton.

He would also have to submit a deposition in London.

Prince Andrew is being represented by Hollywood lawyer Andrew Brettler.

Based in Los Angeles, Mr Brettler is best known for representing several celebrities accused of sexual assault.

Recently he defended actor Armie Hammer who was investigated over claims he raped a woman during their four-year relationship, which he denied.

The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) concluded its nine-month probe in December and has submitted its evidence to the District Attorney's Office.

His other clients include comedian Chris D'Elia, who in 2020 was accused of sexual harassment, grooming and soliciting nude pictures of underage girls. He denied the allegations, which were later withdrawn by the claimant.

Mr Brettler also defended singer-songwriter Ryan Adams, who was accused of engaging in sexual communications with an underage fan. The FBI investigation was dropped after the fan admitted lying about their age.

The lawyer has claimed that the emergence of the Me Too movement has created an ""assumption of wrongdoing based on an accusation, even an anonymous one"".

On the Andrew case he is working with fellow California-based lawyer Melissa Lerner and their counterpart in the UK - Gary Bloxsome of Blackfords law firm.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127122528/https://news.sky.com/story/whos-who-in-the-prince-andrew-sex-assault-case-12517485;
1840;1840;Beijing Winter Olympics: Jamaican bobsleigh team given green light to fly to Games after passes retrieved from Stansted Airport;Thursday 27 January 2022 12:48, UK;[];['beijing winter olympics', 'jamaica'];['team', 'stansted', 'given', 'sky', 'green', 'olympics', 'light', 'winter', 'retrieved', 'bobsleigh', 'watson', 'passes', 'documents', 'wekpe', 'vital', 'jamaican'];"Delays in retrieving the Olympic passes for Jamaica's four-man bobsleigh team have now been resolved, after the crucial documents got stuck at Stansted Airport.

The team's official accreditation had arrived in the UK from Jamaica last Friday but delays releasing them for delivery had been jeopardising their chances of making their flights to Beijing on Friday.

However, on Thursday the airport told Sky News: ""We are pleased to have resolved the issue and successfully delivered the items. We wish them all the best in the games.''

The team said they received the package of documents at 11pm on Wednesday night.

The Jamaican quartet is made up of Shanwayne Stephens, Ashley Watson, Matthew Wekpe, and Nimroy Turgott.

It is the first time in 24 years that Jamaica has had a four-man bobsleigh team at the Winter Games and the very first team that entered in 1988 inspired the hit film Cool Runnings.

Mr Watson told Sky News they ""want to become the best Jamaican team in history"".

Cool Runnings, he said, had brought the team worldwide fame.

""People ask me if I've got a lucky egg"", he said, referencing the egg Sanka Coffie asks his teammates to kiss for luck before the races in the movie.

The delay with passes was a ""very stressful situation"", but the team is excited to be able to head to Beijing tomorrow.

They do not have the same funding enjoyed by most of their rivals, so faced losing up to £20,000 in costs, had the documents not arrived in time.

The strict COVID-19 protocols around the Winter Olympics mean that accreditation passes are even more vital than usual.

While awaiting the vital documents, the 2022 team have been finalising their preparations on a practice track at Bath University.

Appearing on Sky News this morning, 1988 captain Dudley 'Tal' Stokes wished the team luck, adding: ""Focus, concentrate, execute and enjoy what you can.""

The plaintiffs, now aged between 17 and 27, were living in the Fukushima region in March 2011 when an earthquake triggered a tsunami that lead to the disaster.

They are seeking 616 million yen (£4m) in compensation from Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and will file a class-action lawsuit at Tokyo District Court on Thursday, according to Japanese media reports.

An expert investigation committee set up by the government has not recognised a causal link between radiation exposure from the Fukushima disaster and thyroid cancer, and a possible correlation could be the focal issue in the lawsuit.

The six plaintiffs were aged between six and 16 at the time of the nuclear disaster and were diagnosed with thyroid cancer between 2012 and 2018, The Mainichi reported.

Two of them had one side of their thyroid removed, while the rest had their thyroid extracted completely and need to take hormonal drugs for the rest of their lives, according to the newspaper. In one patient, cancer had spread to their lungs.

As of June 2021, 266 people had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer or suspected thyroid cancer following a Fukushima Prefectural Government survey on thyroid glands involving around 380,000 people who were aged 18 or under at the time of the disaster.

Lawyers claim that five of the six plaintiffs had their cancer detected in the survey. The other was diagnosed with cancer after voluntarily undergoing testing at a hospital.

The cancer discovery rate in the survey is several tens of times higher than usual, lawyers argue.

The prefectural government has pointed to the possibility of ""overdiagnosis"" through which many cancer cases requiring no treatment have been found, but the legal team says their clients' cancer progressed.

Lawyers have also highlighted that none of the six plaintiffs' cancer is hereditary, and argue it is highly likely that they developed the disease due to the nuclear disaster.

""Some plaintiffs have had difficulties advancing to higher education and finding jobs, and even given up on their dreams for their future,"" Kenichi Ido, the head of the legal counsel said.

TEPCO said in a statement that it would respond to the case sincerely after hearing the content of the claims and arguments in detail.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127130954/http://news.sky.com/story/six-thyroid-cancer-patients-to-sue-over-fukushima-radiation-12526268;

But it was a story about dogs and cats that threatened to take over in August 2021 as Pen Farthing desperately tried to get the dogs his charity Nowzad had rescued, and his staff, out of Afghanistan.

Supporters raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to charter a flight to evacuate them but former marine, Mr Farthing, then accused the Foreign Office of blocking the evacuation flight.

Eventually, Mr Farthing and his animals left Afghanistan on 28 August, two days before the final British evacuation flight as part of Operation Pitting. Some of his staff were not allowed into the airport by the Taliban, despite being granted British visas but made it out through Pakistan.

Controversy at the time

While Mr Farthing had a lot of support as he tried to get the animals and his staff out, there was also major criticism of him and the government's response.

One of the main issues of contention was claims animals' lives were being placed above human lives, with hundreds of Afghans eligible to be evacuated by the British left behind.

The government was accused of allowing British troops to divert their attention from evacuating people to help with getting the dogs out and using up valuable time when humans could have been evacuated.

Mr Farthing was also accused of threatening Defence Secretary Ben Wallace's special adviser, with a leaked voicemail accusing him of blocking the flight and warning he would ""destroy"" him if he did not approve the flight immediately.

The charity head apologised and said he did that ""out of frustration"" but denied the other claims, saying his charter flight did not need troops, was paid for privately and was given the go-ahead by the government.

Did Boris Johnson personally intervene?

At the time, the PM denied he intervened to get the dogs out and on 27 January said it was ""total rhubarb"" he approved the airlift.

But Dominic Dyer, a friend of Mr Farthing's who co-ordinated the Nowzad evacuation, said he lobbied Mr Johnson's wife, Carrie, who is a friend.

Mr Dyer said he was in no doubt she persuaded her husband to intervene.

Then Raphael Marshall, a former Foreign Office employee involved in Operation Pitting, gave written evidence to parliament that the Foreign Office had ""received an instruction"" from the PM to use ""considerable capacity"" to help evacuate the animals.

He also alleged British soldiers were put at risk to help them.

But Mr Farthing denied this, telling the government Mr Marshall's evidence is ""unverified"" and ""nonsense"".

Why has the issue raised its head again?

As part of an ongoing inquiry into the Afghanistan evacuation, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee released relevant documents at the end of January 2022.

This included an email to the Foreign Office evacuation team from an official saying Nowzad had ""received a lot of publicity"" and ""the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated"".

In December 2021, Mr Johnson said it was ""complete nonsense"" he had intervened.

One of the newly released documents, from Mr Raphael to the committee, said a colleague told the team ""we are doing the dogs"" and the PM had issued this instruction in an emergency COBRA meeting or National Security Council meeting.

He also told the committee ""several"" colleagues messaged on Teams saying the PM had instructed them to ""call forward Nowzad's staff for evacuation"".

PM's aide 'negotiated Nowzad evacuation with charter company'

Following the release of the latest emails, an employee of a charter plane company told Sky News the PM's parliamentary assistant Trudy Harrison contacted them to try to get a plane to transport Mr Farthing and his dogs out of Kabul.

The employee said Ms Harrison, who is also the MP for Copeland, made clear to the company that she worked for the prime minister - repeatedly referring to ""the boss"" and the firm felt it was obvious her requests came with the PM's backing.

Ms Harrison confirmed she contacted a number of companies to help the evacuation effort and did say she was the PM's aide but said he was not involved in the plans.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127141028/http://news.sky.com/story/afghanistan-what-happened-with-pen-farthing-and-the-animal-evacuation-and-did-boris-johnson-intervene-12526551;
1846;1846;COVID-19: North Korea set to reopen borders and resume trading with China;Thursday 27 January 2022 12:28, UK;[];['covid', 'covid-19', 'china', 'north korea'];['trading', 'borders', 'trade', 'korea', 'covid19', 'korean', 'china', 'pandemic', 'kim', 'pyongyang', 'border', 'train', 'resume', 'north', 'set', 'south', 'reopen'];"North Korea is poised to reopen its borders amid fears its fragile economy is on the brink of collapse following a strict two-year lockdown.

Pyongyang has shown signs it will finally ease tough restrictions as it resumed freight train traffic into neighbouring China last week.

Trade between the two nations - crucial to North Korea - is said to have slumped by 80% in 2020.

And it plunged again by two-thirds between January and September last year after North Korea sealed off its borders, according to South Korean estimates.

The tentative reopening comes after North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles on Thursday, in what is said to be the sixth missile test conducted this month.

Analysts have dismissed the launches as a ""cry for attention"" by supreme leader Kim Jong-un.

But Pyongyang is ""running hard in what it perceives to be an arms race with Seoul"", said international affairs professor, Leif-Eric Easley, based at Ewha University in the South Korean capital.

""The (Kim Jong Un) regime is developing an impressive diversity of offensive weapons despite limited resources and serious economic challenges,"" Mr Easley added.

The US has condemned the launch - said not to pose an immediate threat - as it vowed to remain committed to a diplomatic approach and urged North Korea to engage in dialogue.

The first North Korean freight train is thought to have crossed the Yalu River before returning to unload cargo at an airfield in the border town of Uiju.

The airfield is said to have been converted to disinfect imported supplies, believed to include medicine and food.

China's foreign ministry said trade would be maintained across the border while pandemic controls remain.

But South Korean officials say it is unclear whether the North will fully reopen land trade with China.

And experts believe trading will be significantly smaller than pre-pandemic levels.

Partially reopening its border after a prolonged period means North Korea now faces the question of how to acquire and administer vaccines.

It is the only country in the world ""without a real plan"", according to Seoul's Institute of National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea's main spy agency.

""North Korea could end up being the planet's last battlefield in the war against COVID-19,"" analyst Lim Soo-ho said.

The nation insists it has had zero virus infections.

But it responded to the pandemic by restricting cross-border traffic and trade, banning tourists and banishing diplomats - amid reports troops were ordered to shoot trespassers on sight.

Kim Jung-un acknowledged his previous vision for the economy was not working in 2020 and issued a new development for the following five years.

However a review in December last year indicated the plan had yielded ""disappointing"" results.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127141028/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-north-korea-set-to-reopen-borders-and-resume-trading-with-china-12526484;

""Dad was a talented comedy writer and comedian in a particularly golden vintage,"" they said in a statement paying tribute.

""Incidentally he never really liked the terms 'comedy writer' or 'comedian', instead preferring hack and entertainer, and always thought the term 'national treasure' meant he'd just been dug up. He was, in his words, arrogant in his humility.

""He had a gift for friendship (as anyone who still has a landline will testify) and a genius for putting people at their ease. Oh yes, and he made many people laugh. A lot. Over many years.""

Cryer's family said his funeral would take place in the coming weeks and would be followed later by a ""more inclusive"" memorial service.

They also thanked doctors, nurses and consultants who cared for their father, mentioning the names of people from the Macmillan Cancer Support charity. ""It'll be of no surprise to those that knew and worked with him that he was telling an Archbishop of Canterbury joke to a nurse not long before he died.

But speaking during a visit to Wales on Thursday, Mr Johnson said: ""I can tell you that the military always prioritised human beings and that was quite right.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:14 Nandy: 'PM's story is not credible'

Fresh questions about the government's account began to be raised on Wednesday after the emergence of new whistleblower emails which were released by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.

The committee, which is conducting an inquiry into the government's handling of the Afghanistan crisis, disclosed communications which suggest the PM did personally authorise rescue efforts for pets and animals.

On 25 August 2021, an official working for Foreign Office minister Lord Goldsmith sent an email to the Foreign Office ""special cases"" team regarding the possible evacuation of an unnamed animal charity.

In it, the official writes: ""Equivalent charity Nowzad, run by an ex-Royal Marine, has received a lot of publicity and the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated, [animal charity - name redacted] are hoping to be treated in the same capacity.""

This appears to support claims made last year in written evidence by whistleblower Raphael Marshall, a desk officer at the Foreign Office, that the department ""received an instruction from the prime minister"" to use ""considerable capacity"" to help animals leave the country that were being cared for by Nowzad, run by Paul ""Pen"" Farthing.

New emails raise further questions

Correspondence obtained by Sky News between managers at the airline states Ms Harrison said that the transport secretary would ""provide whatever assistance is needed"" to get the animals out and that her efforts had the backing of the government.

There is no further suggestion that the transport secretary had given Ms Harrison any such assurances.

She was requesting help from Virgin to find a plane to make the trip, a plan which eventually fell through.

In a separate email the process of fast-tracking permission for the flight to leave Afghanistan was also discussed after Ms Harrison reportedly said she could guarantee it.

The emails cast doubt on Ms Harrison's claim that she had been acting ""as a constituency MP at all times"".

On Wednesday, Sky News reported that Ms Harrison also contacted a private charter company to arrange a flight saying that her ""boss was keen"".

Downing Street has said the prime minister had ""no role"" in authorising the evacuation.

In a series of emails between staff and senior managers at Virgin Atlantic, Ms Harrison's promises to remove obstacles with the help of various government ministers are outlined in detail.

In one email, sent on 23 August between a senior manager at the company who had been approached directly by Ms Harrison and a second Virgin Atlantic boss the senior manager states: ""My local MP, Trudy Harrison, is PPS to the PM and has sought my advice this evening on the mechanics of transportation of a Mr Farthing and his Afghanistan based rescue dogs and cats plus other evacuees from Kabul imminently.

""She has said relevant permissions would be fast-tracked in government.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:49 Emails: PM Ok'd animal evacuation

In a second email, the same senior manager then emails the chief executive of Virgin the day after, stating that Ms Harrison has full government backing for her intervention.

The exchange reads: ""My local MP Trudy Harrison (who is Boris Johnson's PPS and works at No 10) has enquired of me yesterday evening whether we can provide transportation for Mr Pen Farthing and his rescue animals and others from Kabul... She has said the transportation secretary will provide whatever assistance is required.

""This being a government-backed situation and clearly incredibly sensitive I trust it's in order to bring it to your attention in case you wish to deal with it personally yourself.""

Ms Harrison told Sky News she was acting as a constituency MP. None of her constituents were directly involved in the evacuation.

The aide to the prime minister also emailed the Virgin CEO Shai Weiss directly on the 24 August, a day before she approached the charter company for help to find an alternative plane.

Ms Harrison says ""we are keen to engage in early preparedness as this is a more complex and particularly high profile operation"".

She also states that specific flight codes would be needed from UK defence and that ""we very much hope [they] will be forthcoming, subject to an effective process prioritising those in most urgent need"".

Sky News understands the funding for the charter flight Ms Harrison tried to arrange on the 25 August was being provided by a US philanthropist and campaigner.

Animals that were being cared for in Afghanistan by the Nowzad charity, run by Paul ""Pen"" Farthing, were eventually airlifted on a plane provided by a separate Polish charter company and staff escaped by a land-route.

Ms Harrison told Sky News: ""I was assisting Pen Farthing and Nowzad as a constituency MP in response to many Copeland constituents' requests to assist.

Vitali Klitschko, a previous world heavyweight boxing champion, criticised Germany for supplying Ukraine with 5,000 military helmets while stopping short of providing weapons.

""It's a joke"", he told Sky's Dominic Waghorn.

""I want to say thank you… but it's not enough. It's not really help.""

He said that Germans ""have to decide which side"" they are on, as ""right now, it is not clear"".

Mr Klitschko's comments come after he scalded Germany's government in an interview with German newspaper Bild, saying: ""What kind of support will Germany send next? Pillows?""

The dispute highlights the complicated task the US faces in its attempts to build agreement with European allies - some of which maintain strong business relations with Russia and rely heavily on it for energy - on a strong sanctions package if Moscow attacks.

'We need support'

Meanwhile, Mr Klitschko sent his thanks to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Britain for sending weapons to Ukraine.

""It is very important to us, especially at this moment,"" he said, adding: ""We are appreciative of our friends, for Great Britain, Boris Johnson, and also the United States.

""We need support - we need support in any way, political support, economical support, weapon support. We need defensive weapons.""

He said he was ""very much"" worried about the current situation, along with the Ukrainian people.

""We have never had so many military forces on the border of Ukraine in the history of the country,"" he said.

On Wednesday, the UK and US both said that personal sanctions could be imposed on Russian President Vladimir Putin if Russia invades its neighbour.

'Ukraine wants to be a European country'

Mr Klitschko, who has served as mayor of Kyiv since 2014, said that Ukraine wants to be a European country - and to be ""more than a democratic European country"".

""And we are right in our constitution - it is our way to be a part of the European family.""

But he said Ukraine's vision is ""not the plan of our eastern neighbour"", meaning Russia.

""The plans of Russia - the plans of the president of Russia - is to rebuild Russian empire,"" he said.

He said Mr Putin has been ""very open"" about his strategy.

'We have to defend our country'

""I guess it is the main point why the Russians are so aggressive,"" Mr Klitschko said, adding: ""We in Ukraine are peaceful people, we are not aggressive to anyone.

""We never think about war and we hope it will never, ever happen.

""But right now, in this situation, we have to prepare to defend our country.""

On whether Ukraine is ready to fight Russia, Mr Klitschko said: ""We don't have any other choice. If someone attacks us we have to defend our families, our cities.

""I've been dogged by good luck all my life.""

But anyone who knew him, worked with him or loved his work knew it was much, much more than that.

Quite simply, Cryer, who has died at the age of 86, was an innately funny man, a prolific talent with impeccable comic timing and a punchline always readily available.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:06 Barry Cryer's moth joke

During a career that spanned seven decades, he was a presence on many much-loved TV series, a long-serving panellist on radio show I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, and wrote for a generation of British comedians such as Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett, and Tommy Cooper, as well as US stars including Bob Hope and Richard Prior.

Whether his jokes came from the pen or the stage, they made millions laugh over the years - and inspired scores of younger comics to follow in his footsteps.

Image: Barry Cryer (right) worked with comedy stars including the late Ronnie Corbett

Born in Leeds in 1935, Cryer went on to study English literature at university in the city before beginning his career in entertainment in variety theatre. After moving to London, he started writing for Irish performer Danny La Rue.

It was a chance meeting with the late David Frost at a nightclub that saw him move into the world of TV writing. It was the start of a long-running partnership, with Cryer going on to work on several Frost shows on both the BBC and ITV, including Frost Over England and Frost On Sunday.

""You can't cater for that,"" Cryer once said of their meeting. ""It's serendipity. It just happened, and I've been in the right place at the right time quite a few times in my life.""

The star also appeared on a string of panel shows, including That's Showbusiness, Blankety Blank, and What's My Line?, at the same time writing material for some of British comedy's biggest names, including as one of the main writers on the hit show The Two Ronnies.

Barry Cryer's best one-liners ""Quick - the noise made by a dyslexic duck""

""I'm 59 and people call me middle-aged. How many 118-year-old men do you know?""

""I met my wife and Ronnie Corbett on the same day. I tossed a coin... and married her""

""A wife is in the bathroom trying on a new dress. She comes out and says to her husband: 'Does my bum look big in this?' He says: 'Oh be fair, love, it's quite a small bathroom'""

""Picasso was burgled and did a drawing of the robbers. Police arrested a horse and two sardines""

""Analysing comedy is like dissecting a frog. Nobody laughs and the frog dies""

Billy Connolly, Russ Abbot, Bobby Davro, Jasper Carrott, Morecambe and Wise, Les Dawson, Stanley Baxter, Dick Emery, Dave Allen, Frankie Howerd and Mike Yarwood were among those he worked with over the years.

He was made an OBE in 2001 and was also a member of the entertainment charity the Grand Order of Water Rats. In 2018, he was given a lifetime achievement award for his comedy career by the British Music Hall Society.

Cryer also had another, more unusual addition to his long and distinguished CV - a surprise number one hit thanks to his cover of 1958 novelty song Purple People Eater. Already popular following its release, the comedian's version gained success in the Nordic countries, achieving a number one in Finland.

Image: Cryer pictured at the Oldie of the Year awards in 2015

Funny to the end, he launched the podcast Now, Where Were We? with one of his sons, actor and writer Bob, just a month before his death, featuring chats with famous pals he hadn't seen since for a while due to the pandemic. Guests included Stephen Fry, Danny Baker, Miriam Margolyes and Sanjeev Bhaskar.

""There is some very explicit language used in punchlines from time to time,"" the synopsis for the show reads. ""But Barry's nearly 90, so it's sort of delightful, isn't it?""

Known as Baz by those who loved him, Cryer leaves behind Theresa, his wife of almost 60 years, and their children Tony, David and Jack, as well as Bob; grandchildren Ruby, Tom, Evan, Archie, Hope, Martha and Connie, and great-granddaughter Isobel.

Following his death, his family encouraged people to share their memories and ""celebrate Baz"", paying tribute to ""a talented comedy writer and comedian"" who they said actually preferred the terms ""hack and entertainer"" - and would joke that ""the term 'national treasure' meant he'd just been dug up"".

Cryer had a ""gift for friendship (as anyone who still has a landline will testify) and a genius for putting people at their ease"", they said, adding with his typical comic timing: ""Oh yes, and he made many people laugh. A lot. Over many years.""

Stars of comedy young and old also shared their tributes to and memories of ""one of the absolute greats of British comedy"". They paint a picture of a man who was always there for others, be it making birthday calls or taking the time to offer his words of wisdom.

His own advice to young comics? ""You'll get knocked back when you start, but keep coming back. Dust yourself down and pick yourself up. We all had it to start with and it will happen.

""But the good ones survive.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127170957/http://news.sky.com/story/barry-cryer-obituary-the-comedy-star-and-writer-whose-innate-sense-of-humour-and-perfect-comic-timing-kept-us-laughing-for-decades-12526595;

One million children will die if relief money isn't sent to the country soon, one former UN general has said.

Last August, the UK government promised to double aid sent to the country, but just £145 million out of £286 million has been dispersed so far - meaning nearly half the amount remains unspent and the financial year ends in April.

The country is so starved, and its population so desperate, parents have resorted to selling their children and kidneys just to survive.

A report from Sky's correspondent Alex Crawford depicted the horror of life in Afghanistan, a part of the world which, the United Nations said, is becoming the globe's worst humanitarian disaster.

'Just the tip of the iceberg'

Sir Mark Lowcock, a former UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told Sky News: ""That graphic, compelling, heartbreaking set of stories is really the tip of the iceberg of what's going on in Afghanistan right now.

""The vast majority of the population are starving and that is the reason people resort to these extreme measures.

Image: Men showing their kidney operation scars. Pic: Chris Cunningham

""It's not at all appropriate to enforce a sort of collective punishment on the total population of the country because you don't like the regime that those people haven't chosen.""

He called on the government to release the rest of the promised funds: ""Where is the rest of that money, what are they waiting for?""

Afghanistan currently has billions of its own money stuck outside the country, frozen by foreign governments, which he said could be released to pay teachers and health workers directly.

The UN is seeking £4.4bn to help solve the humanitarian crisis.

""This is a significant requirement but the good news is quite a lot of it could be funded from Afghanistan's own resources,"" said Sir Mark.

He added that while people ""are right to be concerned"" by the Taliban, the price is being paid by children and innocent women.

'One million children will die'

Baroness Valerie Amos, also a former UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told Sky News: ""The world food programme estimates if we don't urgently get money into the country and help people that there will be three million children under five who will face acute malnutrition by March.

""Of those, a million children will die.""

She added: ""We have to find a way of restoring the economy in Afghanistan without getting money into the hands of the Taliban and we have plenty of experience of doing this.""

Sir Mark added: ""It's not just a question of morality and humanity - that it's not acceptable to impose a collective punishment on 40 million people for things they didn't do - it's also going to be counterproductive because it will antagonise people further, it will create grievances.""

'We don't want to work with the Taliban'

Ben Slater, a former British soldier who led an escape effort from Afghanistan after he was stranded in Kabul, said the selling of children has been happening since the fall of Kabul.

""The selling of young girls, for around $200-$300 (£149-240), started immediately, weeks after the takeover,"" he told Sky News.

""Most families live day by day, hand to mouth. That has been going on for months.

""The selling of organs is horrific and they are fetching about $3,000 (£2,240) on the black market at the moment.""

Mr Slater runs Nomad Concepts Group and said the sending of funds into the country had to be managed carefully by the international community.

""A lot of international businesses - including ours - we do not want to work with the Taliban,"" he said. ""We do not want to be put in a position where our funds are going to the Taliban.""

The flight on the private government Airbus A321 taken last week, which the Independent reported was opted for due to security concerns, is estimated to have cost £500,000.

The Foreign Office said the trip as within the rules set out by the ministerial code and that using the chartered plane allowed Ms Truss and her delegation to have ""private discussions on sensitive security matters"".

But Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the move shows the public ""exactly quite how little respect this Conservative government has for taxpayers' money"".

""It is obscene that government ministers are jet setting yet are hiking taxes and refusing to do anything to help working families when they are feeling the pinch of the cost of living crisis,"" Ms Rayner said.

""Tories waste disgusting amounts of public money on their own vanity and comfort, Labour wants to see families see a cut to energy bills, that is the difference.""

Image: Liz Truss travelled to Australia last week to speak to government officials

Labour chairman of the Commons Committee on Standards, Chris Bryant, added in a tweet: ""For comparison, my first trip as a Foreign Office minister was on easyJet at 6am and we didn't pay for speedy boarding.""

Meanwhile, the SNP's spokesperson for the environment, Deidre Brock, said reports of Ms Truss chartering a private jet to Australia would constitute ""a grotesque misuse of taxpayers' money to fund her jet-set lifestyle"".

""With a record like this, 'Lavish Liz' will make a fitting successor to Boris Johnson,"" she said.

The ministerial code says that ministers can authorise non-scheduled flights ""when a scheduled service is not available, or when it is essential to travel by air, but the requirements of official or parliamentary business or security considerations preclude the journey being made by a scheduled service"".

Approached on the claim, the Foreign Office said commercial flights to Australia at the time Ms Truss was travelling were fully booked and that using a standard commercial flight would have separated the foreign secretary from her protection team.

Image: Angela Rayner said the report is proof that the Conservatives 'waste disgusting amounts of public money on their own vanity and comfort'

They said the private jet also gave Ms Truss the flexibility to return to the UK at pace if needed.

""It's necessary for the foreign secretary to travel abroad to pursue UK interests around security, trade and technology, as she did during this visit to Australia,"" a spokesperson for the department said.

""Travelling this way allows ministers to have private discussions on sensitive security matters and flexibility to respond to rapidly changing global events.

""This trip used government transport and was fully within rules.""

The Airbus A321, which Ms Truss had used for her trip, can only be used by the government.

The Foreign Office added that all information on the trip would be set out in regular transparency data.

Ms Truss co-authored a policy paper called Back to Black in 2009 where she and others outlined how: ""Every public sector worker should feel personal responsibility for the money they spend and the money they save.

""They should spend taxpayers' money with at least the care they would give to their own.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127170957/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-criticise-reports-liz-truss-charted-private-jet-for-trip-to-australia-which-cost-taxpayers-500-000-12526715;

He also admitted obstructing PC Steven Ozden.

The court heard that Chew had given the name and old address of his brother to the police officer but he was found out after commenting on the incident in The Sun newspaper.

During an earlier hearing, Rabah Kherbane, defending, said Chew has several conditions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism which would make it difficult for him to follow proceedings.

Chew had at least 26 previous convictions including public order offences, and he was on licence after being released from custody in July 2020.

As well as the eight-week jail sentence, he was ordered to pay £1,058 in costs and compensation.

About six months after the second dose of any COVID vaccine, protection against death with the dominant variant is around 60% in that age group.

But the UKHSA said that the figure rises to around 95% two weeks after a booster dose.

COVID news latest - live updates

Protection against hospitalisation after a booster was around 90% for the Pfizer shot, dropping to 75% between 10 and 14 weeks after the dose.

For Moderna, effectiveness against hospitalisation was 90-95% up to nine weeks after the booster.

Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at UKHSA, said: ""The evidence is clear - the vaccine helps to protect us all against the effects of COVID-19 and the booster is offering high levels of protection from hospitalisation and death in the most vulnerable members of our society.""

The agency also said that its initial analysis of vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron sublineage - BA.2 - found similar protection against symptomatic disease.

It found that 25 weeks after the first two doses of a vaccine, protection against symptomatic disease was 9% for BA.1 and 13% for BA.2.

But this increased to 63% and 70% respectively two weeks after a booster dose.

Almost 65% of those eligible have received a booster or third dose.

Earlier on Thursday, the UKHSA published its weekly COVID-19 surveillance report, showing that the highest rates of the virus are in those aged between five and nine, and the lowest rates are among those aged 70 to 79.

In an 11-page document submitted to the court, he individually addressed each of Ms Giuffre's 73 points and outlined 12 ""affirmative defences"" he plans to use at trial.

He also requested a trial by jury, something Ms Giuffre had already done when she first lodged the lawsuit in August last year.

Who's who in the Prince Andrew sex assault case?

In a bid to win the case, Andrew's lawyers are using, among other things, the court's jurisdiction, Ms Giuffre's 2009 legal settlement with Jeffrey Epstein and her alleged ""own wrongful conduct"" while associated with him.

Here Sky News looks at what the key points in Prince Andrew's defence are.

Virginia Giuffre doesn't live in the US

Andrew's first ""affirmative defence"" is a ""lack of subject matter jurisdiction"".

It states: ""Giuffre's complaint should be dismissed because this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the action, due to Giuffre's improper assertion of diversity jurisdiction notwithstanding that she is a permanent resident of Australia and not a domiciliary of Colorado.""

Last year, Ms Giuffre filed her lawsuit with the US District Court for the Southern District of New York as the state's Child Victims Act allows alleged victims of sexual assault to bring claims long after the usual statutory time limit.

She and her husband used to live in Colorado, but Andrew's lawyers argue that she is now a ""permanent resident of Australia"", which should prevent her from taking legal action in the US.

Sky News legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg notes that if this is accepted by the judge it ""may be impossible"" for Ms Giuffre to pursue her claim.

2009 Epstein agreement

The Duke of York's second defence falls under the term ""waiver and release"".

Earlier this month a secret $500,000 (£370,000) agreement made between Ms Giuffre and Epstein in 2009 was made public.

It was released because Andrew's lawyers believed it contained a clause that would exempt him from the current legal action.

In exchange for the money, Ms Giuffre agreed to ""forever discharge… any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant… from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia Roberts, including state or federal...""

Andrew's lawyers claim that ""through her own actions"" by entering into the agreement she has ""waived the claims now asserted in the complaint"".

Image: Andrew was stripped of his military titles this month

Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected the duke's legal team's bid to get the case thrown out on that basis, but they are continuing to pursue the defence.

Ms Giuffre accused of 'wrongful conduct'

In his sixth defence, Andrew accuses Ms Giuffre of ""wrongful conduct"" under the US legal defence of ""unclean hands"".

Although not specific, he alleges that in her dealings with Epstein, Ms Giuffre has not always behaved in line with the law and thus should be ""barred in whole or in part"" from bringing any legal action against him.

In response, Ms Giuffre's lawyer David Boies suggested this is ""purporting to blame the victim of the abuse for somehow bringing it on herself"".

Maxwell 'not a close friend'

In his response to Ms Giuffre's lawsuit, Andrew denies that he was a ""close friend of Ghislaine Maxwell"".

He admits that both Maxwell and Epstein attended his 40th birthday party in 2000, but denies that during the same year he threw Maxwell a birthday party at Sandringham, with Epstein ""among the guests"".

In his 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, the duke said it was through Maxwell - a mutual friend - that he met Epstein.

He also told the BBC he and Maxwell had met up earlier that year.

Image: Maxwell and Epstein were both invited to Andrew's 40th birthday party

""She was here [in the UK] doing some rally,"" he said, but the pair did not discuss Epstein.

Not 'sufficient evidence' that photo of Andrew and Giuffre 'exists'

In her lawsuit, Ms Giuffre alleges that the now-famous photograph showing her and Prince Andrew with Ghislaine Maxwell in the background was taken ""at Maxwell's home prior to Prince Andrew sexually abusing"" her.

This is believed to have been on 10 March 2001 when the trio are alleged to have gone to Tramp nightclub in Mayfair before returning to Maxwell's Belgravia home.

Andrew told Newsnight he took his daughter Princess Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking that night before returning home to Windsor.

His defence states that he ""lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegations that there exists photographic evidence of his alleged meeting with Giuffre"".

In his Newsnight interview, Andrew said: ""Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken.""

Image: Virginia Giuffre is pictured outside court

He claimed he didn't believe it was him as he did not usually dress that way to go out in London and would not engage in public displays of affection such as putting his arm around a woman's waist.

Andrew denies being a 'frequent guest in Epstein's various homes'

In line with what he said to the BBC in 2019, Andrew's legal document confirms that he met Jeffrey Epstein ""in or around 1999"".

But he denies becoming a ""frequent guest in Epstein's various homes around the world"".

Epstein had residences in New York, Palm Beach and his private island Little St James.

Image: Jeffrey Epstein is pictured in front of a private jet

During the Newsnight interview, Andrew said he stayed at Epstein's New York mansion in 2010 as it was a ""convenient place to stay"" during a trip in which he cut ties with the disgraced billionaire.

His legal team says there is not ""sufficient evidence"" that he began flying on Epstein's private planes from 1999 - while Ms Giuffre's lawyers claim this is evidenced in ""available flight logs"".

They also argue a ""lack of sufficient evidence"" for Ms Giuffre's claims that Epstein's ""Black Book"", which ""documented his frequent travel with young girls and powerful individuals on his private plane"", included ""12 different contact numbers listed for Prince Andrew"".

What happens next?

The document submitted this week is merely procedural as without a formal response, Ms Giuffre would win her case by default.

Now he has answered it officially, a trial date is pencilled in for between September and December this year.

This is likely to be by jury as both parties have requested it.

Joshua Rozenberg explains that this is fairly commonplace in US civil trials.

""He's saying I'm not going to admit anything really,"" he told Sky News. ""You've got to prove all the allegations against me in front of a jury and I'm denying everything.""

He could be compelled to give evidence in person at trial, as it ""wouldn't look good"" to a jury to be absent, Mr Rozenberg adds, although there are arrangements for him to give evidence in advance.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220127200941/http://news.sky.com/story/what-are-the-main-points-in-prince-andrews-defence-against-virginia-giuffres-sex-abuse-lawsuit-12526321;

Emerging from the 50-minute talks in Dublin, fishing representatives said that a buffer zone will now be used for the five-day missile drills.

While the operational details still need final approval from Moscow, it is understood from sources that the buffer zone will be flexible and will keep 60 to 80 kilometres (37 to 49 miles) between Russian and Irish vessels.

The row, which garnered international media attention, came after Russia warned Irish aviation authorities of plans to hold live-fire naval drills, including the firing of rockets, around 240km (149 miles) off the southwestern coast of Ireland.

The exercises will take place outside Ireland's territorial waters, but well inside its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

Earlier on Thursday, the Irish government issued a safety notice to all seafarers warning of the exact location of the Russian military exercises, which will be carried out from 3-8 February.

""The Russian Federation has indicated that the exercises will include the use of naval artillery and launching of rockets,"" the government warning said.

Fishermen were angry at the potential disruption to their traditional fishing grounds, and this week said that up to 60 trawlers planned to peacefully disrupt the Russian plans by fishing as normal in the area.

The row, and the ensuing media attention, prompted Russian Ambassador Yury Filatov to invite fishing representatives for talks on Thursday.

'Pathway for coexistence'

Speaking after the meeting, Brendan Byrne, chief executive of the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association, said they had reached ""an accommodation where there is a pathway for coexistence for the naval exercises and for our fishing fleet"" during the planned military drills next week.

He said a joint proposal for a ""buffer zone"" between the two sides would be used, pending final sign-off from the Russian government.

Image: Mr Byrne said he had been impressed by how well briefed the Russian ambassador had been

Mr Byrne said he had been impressed by how well briefed the Russian ambassador had been, and said the fishermen had been better treated by the Russians than by their own government.

""We've been given assurances by the ambassador that this will be safe,"" said Patrick Murphy, chief executive of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation.

""He accepted our concerns, and accepted the validity of what we're entitled to do, which is to go fishing within our fishing grounds.""

Russia says 'No threat to Ireland'

Russia had said that the live-fire exercises posed ""no threat"" to Ireland.

Mel Stride, who chairs the influential Commons Treasury Select Committee, told Sky News that ""for a period of one year, the increase should be jettisoned"" as the economy is managing better than the Office for Budget Responsibility had predicted it would.

Mr Stride warned Treasury ministers to be mindful that ""cost of living pressures are very prevalent"" and said shelving plans to hike National Insurance payments in April would be ""one way of helping to address some of that"".

Earlier this week, Downing Street said Boris Johnson remains ""committed"" to the proposed rise.

The prime minister's official spokesperson told reporters Mr Johnson believes the proposal is the ""right approach"" to ""tackling the massive backlog"" facing the NHS and to ""address the long-standing problem of fixing our social care system"".

Asked whether reports that members of Mr Johnson's cabinet will back a move to delay the rise are accurate, the PM's spokesperson added: ""Cabinet took a collective decision to take this action, to put money into our NHS, to tackle the backlogs, to resolve the long-standing problem of social care and to fund a pay rise for nurses. The cabinet stands behind that decision.""

In September, the PM announced that National Insurance contributions will rise by 1.25% to pay for the social care system in England in a bid to end the ""unpredictable and catastrophic costs"" faced by many.

A social care package, which the prime minister has called ""the biggest catch-up programme"" in the NHS's history, will be funded through a new, UK-wide 1.25% health and social care levy from April 2022.

The decision to put up contributions broke the Conservative Party's 2019 election manifesto pledge.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:00 This year promises to be a tough one for many, with the price of food, fuel and energy all rising.

The 1.25 percentage point increase is predicted to raise about £36bn which, in the early years, will mainly be used to tackle the NHS backlog.

What is the PM's plan for social care?

The PM's plan to overhaul the social care sector includes:

• A government pledge to invest £36bn over the next three years to help the NHS recover from the pandemic

• Investment in reforming the social care sector

• A promise that from October 2023, nobody will pay more than £86,000 for their social care - regardless of their assets

• That the government will fully cover the cost of care for those with assets under £20,000, and contribute to the cost of care for those with assets of between £20,000 and £100,000

Concerns about hike amid cost of living crisis

The plan was signed off by ministers at a cabinet meeting four months ago, but now it is understood that some ministers are calling for it to be halted as household bills continue to soar.

Mr Stride made clear to Sky News he was expressing his own views and not those of the committee he chairs.

Asked if he thought the proposed rise should go ahead in April, he told Sky News' deputy political editor Sam Coates: ""I don't, actually - because I think the chancellor has had some recent news which has given him a bit more space to manoeuvre in the short term.

""So, I think for a period of one year, that increase should be jettisoned.

""And the increased space that he's got of course is that the economy is doing better than the OBR - the Office for Budget Responsibility - was projecting back at the time of the budget by about the same amount that he would lose by not having that increase.

""And of course, cost of living pressures are very prevalent, it is going to be very difficult for a lot of people this year - and this will be one way of helping to address some of that.""

Mr Stride added that ""given the circumstances at the moment and the kind of pressures there are out for people"", delaying the rise ""would be the right thing to do"".

Image: Senior Conservative David Davis has called for the move to be scrapped

MPs pressure government to scrap cut

Other members of the PM's own party, including former cabinet minister David Davis, have called for the hike to be scrapped amid the ongoing cost of living crisis.

And Brexit minister Lord Frost quit his role at the tail end of last year in protest at government tax increases.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Johnson said the ""terrible strain"" the coronavirus pandemic has put on the health service means the National Insurance hike is essential, but did not explicitly say the rise would take place in April.

Pushed on whether the proposal should be halted, the prime minister vowed to tackle the cost of living crisis by helping ""getting people into work"".

For one thing, it really does feel empty. The streets are dotted with houses, but there is nobody around.

For another, there is a decommissioned East German nuclear power plant not far from the harbour.

And thirdly, Lubmin is home to just about the most controversial building project in the world.

Image: Lubmin is home to just about the most controversial building project in the world

For here, in a turning off the main road, you can find the place where Nord Stream 2 pops up from the earth - a mass of long, wide pipes that emerge from the ground and then get funnelled off in various directions.

Explainer: How the Nord Stream 2 pipeline has been controversial from the start

Not heard of it? You will.

Nord Stream 2 is a pipeline that connects Russia with Germany, capable of bringing in enough natural gas to power around 26 million households.

It is, depending on your perspective, either a commercial triumph that secures Germany's energy security for years to come, or a warning sign of how Russia can exploit its natural resources to beguile western governments.

It might well be both.

Image: Nord Stream 2 is expected to be complete by the end of the year

Germany's pivot away from nuclear power stations

By the end of this year, Germany will have closed all its nuclear power stations and will lean ever more on natural gas as it grows its renewable energy sector.

Nord Stream 2, combined with the earlier Nord Stream 1 pipeline, are designed to ensure that supply.

Building the second pipeline has long been controversial.

While former chancellor Angela Merkel insisted it was simply a commercial venture, much of the rest of the world has seen it as a geopolitical exercise by the Kremlin.

Certainly, the pipeline creates a sense of dependency upon Russia, which is awkward at the best of times but all the more inflammatory when Russian troops are massing on the Ukrainian border.

Viewed from a bank on the other side of the road, Nord Stream 2 is the sort of thing you could drive past with just a shrug of curiosity.

It's a mass of steel, concrete and low-rise buildings.

For the moment, with the pipeline yet to start work, it is still. And yet this building is loaded with political weight.

Germany to defy NATO?

NATO allies have no desire for a military conflict with Russia.

Image: Increased tensions between Ukraine and Russia have put Germany's relationship with the Kremlin under the microscope

Instead, their plan for deterring, or punishing, President Vladimir Putin revolves around the spectre of punitive economic sanctions and an obvious target would be Russia's lucrative energy sector.

So that's the problem for Germany. Imposing sanctions on Russia could mean disrupting its own energy supplies or even shuttering Nord Stream 2 for good.

Olaf Scholz, the relatively newly-elected chancellor, was reluctant to agree and his hesitancy reverberated around the world.

By the time he agreed to support the sanctions proposals, Germany had been castigated by politicians in America, Britain, Poland and beyond.

Image: Thorsten Benner says that the backlash has forced Germany to change its position

""I do think the backlash against the German position does register and it has influenced the position of the government to now put sanctions on the table,"" says Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank based in Berlin.

""As a nation, we are reputation-sensitive. Nord Stream 2 is now on the table in terms of sanctions.

""It has taken a long time - a few weeks ago the chancellor was reluctant to put it on the table but now he's confirmed that if Russia does attack Ukraine then that could have consequences for Nord Stream.""

It was that specific hesitation that spooked people - the idea that Germany, the richest nation in the European Union, might not join a NATO sanctions programme.

'Irritating' statement has created a 'disastrous' image of Germany

Even now, after Chancellor Scholz has conceded that he would accept sanctions, the point has had to be reinforced repeatedly, most recently by his foreign minister Annalena Baerbock. Trust has been tarnished.

Its defenders would say that Germany is in a curious, delicate position.

Lubmin, for instance, stands in land that was, until a few decades ago, East Germany, and there are millions of Germans who grew up under Communist control, looking towards Moscow as their political hub.

Similarly, there is a theory that Germany retains a deep-rooted guilt over the suffering it imposed upon Russia during the Second World War.

Certainly, the shame of that conflict still moulds an engrained desire to favour diplomatic negotiations over military conflict.

While other NATO members talk of sending weapons to Ukraine, Germany has sent thousands of helmets and has blocked the export of German-made weapons from Estonia, even though the weapons in question are aged howitzers that date back to the days of East Germany.

Image: Thomas Erndl says 'irritating statements' have led to a 'disastrous image' emerging of Germany

Thomas Erndl believes that ""irritating statements"" have led to a ""disastrous image"" emerging of Germany.

As an opposition politician from the CSU party, he might be expected to be critical. But he is also the vice chairman of Germany's highly-respected foreign affairs committee, and he is sure that his country is getting things wrong.

""I think the government should revisit its position and think about supplying weapons to Ukraine,"" he tells me.

""We need to increase Ukraine's defence capabilities. If the government cannot go that far then at least they should allow other countries to supply deliveries.

""When Germany was, in the past, on the front line in the Cold War, we could rely on others. Now it is up to us to support the countries on the frontline.

""We need to get that message into our people so they know what's up and why it's important to support the Ukrainians.""

Jermaine Cools was just 14 when he was killed last November in Croydon, south London, in a record year for teen murders in the capital.

At his funeral, three of the pallbearers were schoolchildren. Seeing them carry a coffin covered in pictures of the teenager was a reminder this was another life cut too short.

Image: 'We've been living in a lot of pain,' Jermaine's father Julius says

Scores of well-wishers packed the Shiloh Church in Thornton Heath for the teenager's funeral. Those gathered included his friends, family, members of the police force and the Deputy Mayor of London, Sophie Linden.

Speaking after the service, Jermaine's father Julius described the last few months as ""terrible"".

He said: ""Our son was everything, to be honest.

""We've been living in a lot of pain, we don't sleep at night, we just wake up and keep asking ourselves why?""

In a year in which 30 young people were killed, including five in Croydon, a borough some people have dubbed London's knife crime capital, Julius also had words for young people involved in the violence.

""The knife is not a game thing, it's a serious thing,"" he added. ""It's not a toy. Take a book, read a Bible, sing a song. It's not a toy thing and [like] a lot of people's parents, we're going through this pain.""

Friends and family remember 'good boy'

Mourners at the service watched a short video clip filled with pictures of Jermaine before they heard anecdotes from friends and family about someone his sister Amanie simply described as a ""good boy"".

Image: Scott Reynolds spoke in the service about playing PlayStation games with his brother

Another one of the pallbearers was his brother Scott Reynolds, who spoke in the service about playing PlayStation games with Jermaine, who would often buy him peanut fudge bars.

He said he ""couldn't breathe"", when he was looking down at the coffin as he spoke at the pulpit.

""I tried not to think of him in the coffin, it's just sad,"" Scott said. ""To me, in life, it's something I always know, you're supposed to look after your younger brother and then me being on the stage and looking down on my little brother is something I didn't want to do.""

This wasn't just a funeral, it was a fightback. The community leaders who gathered wanted to use the day to signal to the police that tackling knife crime will take a joint effort between themselves, the police and parents.

Malaki Thorpe, 18, of Fairview Road in Tottenham, has been charged with two counts of racially aggravated actual bodily harm and one count of possession of an offensive weapon following the incident on Wednesday.

Police were called to Cadoxton Avenue, Haringey, at 9.50pm after receiving reports that two men had been assaulted.

They were taken to a north London hospital to be treated.

Thorpe will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court today.

A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said the incident is being treated as a hate crime.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled"" by the incident.

""This attack is a terrible reminder, on Holocaust Memorial Day, that such prejudice is not consigned to history, but remains a very real problem in society. We must stamp out antisemitism."" he said.

Home Secretary Priti Patel described the incident as an ""absolutely despicable attack"".

The lowest level of restrictions are now being imposed - meaning nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, and social distancing guidance will be scrapped.

The rule of six will no longer apply to gatherings in venues such as hospitality, cinemas, and theatres - and licenced premises will no longer need to only provide table service or collect punters' contact information.

What are the different COVID-19 rules across England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland?

Crowds will be able to return to outdoor sporting events as the Six Nations rugby tournament kicks off next week - with Wales due to host Scotland at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on 12 February.

The easing of restrictions brings to an end tougher rules that had been in place since Boxing Day.

However, COVID passes will still be required at larger outdoor events attended by more than 4,000 unseated guests, or 10,000 seated - as well as nightclubs, cinemas, theatres, and concert halls.

Although the Welsh government will continue to advise people to work from home, it is now no longer a legal requirement.

However, businesses, employers and other organisations must undertake a coronavirus risk assessment - and implement reasonable measures to minimise the spread of the virus.

Self-isolation period cut to five days

The self-isolation period in Wales has also been cut to a minimum of five full days, effective from today.

The new rules mean people will be able to end their isolation as long as they have two negative lateral flow tests on days five and six.

It will bring the nation in line with the measures in place in England and Northern Ireland.

Health minister Baroness Eluned Morgan said: ""After carefully reviewing all the available evidence, we believe that testing on days five and six together with five full days of isolation will have the same protective effect as a 10-day isolation period.

""But it is really important everyone self-isolates and uses lateral flow tests in the way advised to ensure they protect others from the risk of infection.""

Face masks

Masks will continue to be required in most indoor public places in Wales, with secondary school pupils asked to wear face coverings until half-term.

This is in contrast to England, where the rule has been axed - although they are still required in some businesses and are mandatory on all Transport for London services, including the Tube.

What are the rules on face masks?

First Minister Mark Drakeford said the rules will be reviewed in three weeks on 10 February.

Restrictions have been eased gradually as part of a phased plan after cases peaked in Wales at just over 2,300 per 100,000 people in early January, before dropping back to round 500 cases.

Meanwhile, The i reports that measures to tackle the cost of living crisis are being delayed because of the ongoing political turmoil surrounding allegations of parties in Downing Street.

On Thursday, the US ambassador to the UN asked the security council to meet publicly on Monday.

Russia has manoeuvred around 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine, though Moscow has denied it plans to invade its former Soviet neighbour.

Russia 'engaging in destabilising acts'

""Russia is engaging in other destabilising acts aimed at Ukraine, posing a clear threat to international peace and security and the UN Charter,"" ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement.

""This is not a moment to wait and see. The council's full attention is needed now, and we look forward to direct and purposeful discussion on Monday,"" she added.

Any member of the security council could call for a procedural vote to block the meeting. At least nine votes are needed to win such a vote and Russia, the US, Britain, France, and China cannot use their vetoes.

""As we continue our relentless pursuit of diplomacy to de-escalate tensions in the face of this serious threat to European and global peace and security, the UN Security Council is a crucial venue for diplomacy,"" Ms Thomas-Greenfield said.

The UN Security Council has met dozens of times to discuss the Ukraine issue since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but it is unable to take action as Russia has veto powers.

Difference in interpretation surrounds US-Ukraine phone call Mark Stone US correspondent @Stone_SkyNews The US has now called for a UN Security Council in New York on Monday.

Remember that Russia takes over the rotating presidency of the security council in February, so to get a meeting in beforehand is clearly useful. That's the first bit of news. The second is rather more intriguing. There was a phone call this afternoon US time between presidents Zelensky of Ukraine and Biden of America. It was a chance for the two of them to catch up. They've clearly spoken a lot over the course of the past week or so. But there is a big difference in interpretation of how that phone call went. The Americans have released a pretty bland statement saying that it went pretty well: President Biden reaffirmed the readiness of the United States along with its allies to respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine. Biden also underscored the commitment of the United States to Ukraine's sovereign and territorial integrity. But the Ukrainians are suggesting that President Biden, and this is being reported in the US media, that President Biden said that Kiev could be overrun, that Russian forces may attempt to occupy it, and to ""prepare for impact"". That is apparently what President Biden said to President Zelensky. To which the Americans, in the form of the spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, has said not true, this is not the right interpretation. ""President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February. He has said this previously and publicly and we've been warning about this for months. Reports of anything more or different from that are completely false.""

Biden calls Ukrainian president

Mr Biden's warning came in a phone call with Mr Zelenskiy in which they also agreed on ""joint actions for the future"" and discussed possibilities of financial support.

The US has also sought to reassure the EU it will help them find alternative gas supplies if Russia cuts them off. EU nations rely on Russia for around a third of their gas supplies.

It comes after the US threatened to block the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany if Moscow makes a move on Ukraine.

Ned Price, a US State Department spokesperson, said: ""I want to be very clear: if Russia invades Ukraine one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.

""We will work with Germany to ensure it does not move forward.""

Another high-level call will take place on Friday morning - this time between Russian President Vladimir Putin and French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.

Russia says US has not addressed security concerns

Earlier on Thursday, Russia said the US had not addressed its main security concerns - though stressed both sides would keep the door open to further dialogue.

The US and NATO had submitted written responses on Wednesday to Russia's demands for a redrawing of post-Cold War security arrangements in Europe.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow needed time to review and would not rush to conclusions.

But he said US and NATO statements describing Russia's main demands as unacceptable did not leave much ground for optimism.

""Based on what our (US and NATO) colleagues said yesterday, it's absolutely clear that on the main categories outlined in those draft documents ... we cannot say that our thoughts have been taken into account or that a willingness has been shown to take our concerns into account,"" Mr Peskov said. ""But we won't rush with our assessments.""

The public-facing arm of the spy agency GCHQ encouraged everyone to read new guidance published on its website entitled: ""Actions to take when the cyber threat is heightened.""

Paul Chichester, director of operations at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said: ""While we are unaware of any specific cyber threats to UK organisations in relation to events in Ukraine, we are monitoring the situation closely and it is vital that organisations follow the guidance to ensure they are resilient.

""Over several years, we have observed a pattern of malicious Russian behaviour in cyber space. Last week's incidents in Ukraine bear the hallmarks of similar Russian activity we have observed before.""

Ukraine was hit on 14 January by what Ukrainian officials described as a ""massive cyber attack"" that targeted some 70 government websites.

Oleksiy Danilov, the top security adviser to Ukraine's president, told Sky News at the time that he was 99.9% sure Russia was behind the assault.

The Kremlin has denied the claim.

Officials from the NCSC are ""urgently"" helping the Ukrainian government investigate the attack and discover who was behind it.

The cyber offensive unfolded as Russia amasses more than 100,000 troops and weaponry close to Ukraine's borders.

The military mobilisation has prompted fears in Western capitals of a new Russian invasion of its neighbour - eight years after President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and backed separatists in the east.

The NCSC said in a statement on Friday: ""While the government is not attributing responsibility for the recent cyber incidents in Ukraine, the NCSC is urgently investigating them.

""Incidents of this nature are similar to a pattern of Russian behaviour seen before in previous situations.""

This included a global cyber attack in 2017 that cost businesses around the world hundreds of millions of pounds.

The UK has previously accused Russian military intelligence of launching the NotPetya attack against government IT systems in Ukraine.

The malware then spread across 64 other countries, including the UK.

Cyber hostilities are a form of attack that can take place in a grey zone under the threshold of war or as part of a physical, military invasion.

The new NCSC warning appears designed to try to ensure British companies and other organisations are better prepared in case another cyber attack against Ukraine then infects the internet worldwide.

It is a sign of how a conflict in one part of the world can impact anyone, anywhere because cyber weapons do not respect geographical boundaries.

The ""guidance encourages organisations to follow actionable steps that reduce the risk of falling victim to an attack"", the cyber centre said.

These actions are listed on its new guidance, which was published last week - three days after the cyber attack against Ukrainian government websites became public.

They include things like patching systems; enabling multifactor authentication; and checking that backups and restore mechanisms are working.

Any organisation that falls foul of a cyber attack is advised to report the incident to the NCSC.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220128050946/http://news.sky.com/story/british-firms-warned-to-check-their-cyber-defences-over-fears-of-new-russian-attacks-12526947;

On Thursday afternoon, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss described a Sky News report showing how Afghans are resorting to desperate measures to feed themselves after the Taliban takeover as ""extremely, extremely concerning"".

It came after Baroness Amos, a former UN under-secretary-general, told Sky News that if money wasn't urgently sent into the country, there would ""be three million children under five who will face acute malnutrition by March. Of those, a million children will die.""

The Foreign Office has now pledged £97m of emergency aid for Afghanistan this winter, which the department says will provide over 2.7 million people with food, health services and water amid a worsening crisis.

Last August, the UK government promised to double aid sent to the country, but up until now just £145 million out of £286 million has been dispersed.

The country is so starved, and its population so desperate, Sky News found parents resorting to selling their children and kidneys in order to feed their families.

The government said the latest allocation of support means the UK has now delivered on its promise to double UK aid.

Ms Truss said: ""The UK continues to provide vital humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan. We have doubled UK aid this year to save lives, protect women and girls and support stability in the region.

""The funds announced today will mean essential food, shelter and health supplies will reach those who are most in need.""

Reports of organ selling 'extremely concerning'

Speaking to broadcasters earlier, the foreign secretary was asked about the Sky News report highlighting the desperation of the country's population.

""Well, they are extremely, extremely concerning and that is why we have upped the level of humanitarian aid into Afghanistan and that is why we are working very hard with partners across the international community to secure peace and stability in Afghanistan,"" she said.

The Foreign Office said the funds announced today will also be used to help survivors of gender-based violence and provide support for essential child protection services.

Aid agencies will prioritise those most at risk and the funding will be primarily channelled through the UN Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, World Food Programme (WFP), and United Nations Children's Fund, the department added.

Efforts 'simply not good enough'

But Labour said the government's efforts to help those in Afghanistan have been ""simply not good enough"".

Labour's shadow development minister Preet Kaur Gill said: ""Just this week the government confirmed that barely half the monies promised for Afghanistan had reached the country. This is simply not good enough.

""The remaining £141 million should be released immediately.

""The UN have made an appeal for $4.4bn. Labour are calling on the government to convene a pledging conference as a matter of urgency.""

'The tip of the iceberg'

Referring to Alex Crawford's Sky News report from Afghanistan on Thursday, Sir Mark Lowcock, another former UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said: ""That graphic, compelling, heart-breaking set of stories is really the tip of the iceberg of what's going on in Afghanistan right now.

""The vast majority of the population are starving and that is the reason people resort to these extreme measures.

""It's not at all appropriate to enforce a sort of collective punishment on the total population of the country because you don't like the regime that those people haven't chosen.""

Afghanistan currently has billions of its own money stuck outside the country, frozen by foreign governments, which Sir Mark said could be released to pay teachers and health workers directly.

'We've got days'

Former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, now chief executive of the International Rescue Committee charity, told Sky News that the problem could be relieved by paying the country's civil servants directly and allowing the banking system to operate.

Mr Miliband said: ""The World Bank is allowing staff employed by NGOs to be paid... We know that more than half the country's civil servants are teachers; paying them through international institutions including the World Bank or UN institutions, has been done in other places, for example in Yemen.

""Paying public servants does not mean paying the people who are running their departments.

""We've haven't got months to sort this out, we've got days. But it is sortable.""

Mr Biden appeared with Mr Breyer at the White House to formally announce his retirement.

During his election campaign in 2020, the president vowed to make the historical nomination to the Supreme Court, and he reiterated his promise on Thursday.

Mr Biden said: ""Our process is going to be rigorous. I will select a nominee worthy of Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence and decency.

""While I've been studying candidates' backgrounds and writings, I've made no decision except one: the person I nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity - and that person will be the first black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court.

""It's long overdue, in my view.""

Who are some of the contenders?

Potential nominees include Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was appointed to the US Court of Appeal last year.

Leondra Kruger, who is currently a judge on the Supreme Court in California, is another option.

And also in the running is Michelle Childs, a federal district court judge in South Carolina.

Mr Breyer has been in the role for 28 years, having been appointed by Bill Clinton in 1994.

The justice has been a pragmatic member of an increasingly conservative court, trying to force majorities with more moderate justices right and left of centre.

It's a lifetime role, but at the age of 83, there were some calls for the liberal judge to step aside.

In his retirement letter, he said he will depart at the end of the court's current term in June if a successor is confirmed.

Trump's legacy still lives on

Mr Biden said he wants the Senate, which is controlled by the Democrats, to ""move promptly"" once he has chosen his nominee.

Democrats can confirm a nominee without a single Republican vote because in 2017, Republicans changed the Senate rules to no longer require the approval of 60 of the 100 senators to allow nominations to move forward.

Even though Mr Breyer's replacement will be liberal, the court will still have a conservative majority of 6-3.

The force has doubled the reward money for finding the man, who targeted the city's gay community.

The ""Doodler"" is suspected of killing at least five gay white men between January 1974 and June 1975.

He is believed to have targeted men at gay clubs and restaurants and had sex with them before launching his attacks.

Four bodies were located around Ocean Beach, while a fifth was found at Golden Gate Park.

Sixth victim tied to killer

On Thursday, police said a potential sixth victim had been tied to the killer.

It comes after local newspaper the San Francisco Chronicle released a series of articles last year which followed cold case detectives as they investigated the death of Warren Andrews.

The San Francisco Police Department has now confirmed it believes Andrews' death is connected to the serial killer.

""On April 27, 1975, Andrews was a victim of an assault at Land's End,"" the department said in a statement. ""Andrews was found unconscious and never regained consciousness dying several weeks later.""

Lands End is a popular hiking spot located around 1.5 miles from Ocean Beach, where four of the other victims' bodies were found.

While other victims had been stabbed to death, Andrews was beaten to death with a rock and a tree branch.

In 2018, San Francisco police released a sketch of how the killer could have aged after 40 years.

It was based on the original descriptions given by two men who survived assaults in July 1975. Both were stabbed with knives.

Dr Alvin Helden of Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) made the find during field work with students in the Kibale National Park and it belongs to a group of insects so rare that its closest relative was last seen in 1969.

It has been named Phlogis kibalensis and is from the leafhopper family, with its distinctive metallic sheen, pitted body and leaf shaped male reproductive organs.

Image: The discovery was made at the Kibale National Park in western Uganda

Before the new discovery, made in 2018, the last recorded sighting of a leafhopper from the rare Phlogis genus was in Central African Republic in 1969.

Leafhoppers are closely related to cicadas but much smaller, with the newly discovered male species measuring just 6.5mm long.

Dr Helden said he noticed under a microscope the male bug was of a new species due to the shape of its reproductive organs, which have a bit that looks like ""little leaves"" and is ""towards the tip of the structure"".

The insects mainly eat plant sap and are preyed on by spiders, beetles and parasitic wasps, as well as birds.

Dr Helden, a member of the Applied Ecology Research Group at ARU, said: ""To find this new species is a once in a lifetime achievement, particularly as it's closest relative was last found in a different country over 50 years ago. I knew it was something very special as soon as I spotted it.

""Leafhoppers of this genus, and the wider tribe, are very unusual in appearance, and are rarely found. In fact, they are so incredibly rare that their biology remains almost completely unknown, and we know almost nothing about Phlogis kibalensis.

""There are some wonderful places, like the Kibale National Park in Uganda, where wildlife will survive, but outside national parks and reserves, the amount of rainforest that has been cleared in the tropics is devastating.

""Rare species could be living anywhere, but deforestation means it is inevitable that we will be losing species before we have discovered them.""

Sources have confirmed that Sue Gray, the senior civil servant leading the inquiry into a series of events in Downing Street and across Whitehall which are alleged to have broken COVID-19 lockdown rules, will comply with the Met's request.

She is now assessing whether she is in a position to finish the process or whether there will now be a delay.

Gray put in 'invidious position'

Advertisement

It is understood Ms Gray's team have not ruled out finalising a version that passes muster with the Met. Whatever is published will take into account the force's latest statement.

Sky's political editor Beth Rigby notes that this amounts to an invidious position for Ms Gray, who has to decide whether to put a partial version of her report out now, or wait until the police investigation is complete.

Her report, which is likely to have a significant impact on Boris Johnson's future as prime minister, has not yet been delivered to Number 10.

The Met announced earlier this week it was investigating a ""number of"" gatherings in 2020 and 2021 for potential breaches of COVID regulations.

In its latest statement released on Friday, the force said: ""For the events the Met is investigating, we asked for minimal reference to be made in the Cabinet Office report.

Met's latest statement is significant - but whether it's good or bad news for the PM is unclear Rob Powell Political correspondent @robpowellnews This statement from the Met goes some way to explaining why the Gray report has been delayed. But it also throws the publication of this crucial inquiry into doubt. The fact officers have asked for ""minimal reference"" to be made to events they are investigating raises the potential that details about the most serious allegations could be scaled back, if the report is to published before the police inquiry concludes. Labour has already warned of the potential for the Gray report to be watered down if details around certain events are removed. Then there is the question about what Sue Gray does next. Faced with accusations of releasing an incomplete report, the famously thorough civil servant may decide it is in fact better to hold off on publication until the Met has finished its inquiries. That could mean weeks of waiting though. This all, on a basic level, is good for Boris Johnson. But it also scrambles the political calculations being made by those trying to remove him. Do they now wait for the full Gray report to be released? At which point the political dynamic may have shifted, especially if the prime minister is exonerated by the Met. Or do they act now? There are also legal questions over why exactly the Met believes the Cabinet Office report presents a risk of prejudice, given there is no apparent prospect of a jury trial resulting from the inquiry. Today's intervention from the Met confirms what we all thought: that the decision to launch a criminal investigation threw a major spanner into the Cabinet Office inquiry. But it also substantially changes the prime minister's political outlook. Whether that's for good or for ill is still not clear.

""The Met did not ask for any limitations on other events in the report, or for the report to be delayed, but we have had ongoing contact with the Cabinet Office, including on the content of the report, to avoid any prejudice to our investigation.""

Officers are currently investigating possible breaches of COVID rules that could warrant fixed penalty notices rather than more serious offences, according to the PA news agency.

Westminster has been braced for the publication of the Gray report, but this latest police statement throws the timing of that into doubt.

Politicians and legal figures question Met's move

Some legal figures have questioned the rationale behind the force's request.

Reacting to the statement, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the report ""must be published in full and undoctored without further delay"".

""People are understandably concerned that this increasingly looks like a cover up,"" he said.

This criticism was echoed by the Liberal Democrats, with the party leader Sir Ed Davey telling Sky News the delay is an ""utter fiasco and it's got to stop"".

Sir Ed said he is ""worried about any growing perception of a stitch up"" between the government and the leadership of the Metropolitan Police.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted to ""see Sue Gray's report in full and the investigation finished as quickly as possible"", claiming the government is ""paralysed"" by the ongoing police investigation.

Asked whether, given he was previously director of public prosecutions, he saw any issues of prejudice, Sir Keir said: ""Any issues of prejudice have got to be worked through but this whole mess, this whole paralysing of politics, is being caused by the prime minister and his wrongdoing.""

Fran Hall, a spokesperson for the COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group who lost her police officer husband to COVID, said the Gray report has ""turned into a circus"".

""Tragically, it seems here that the Metropolitan Police have broken the trust of the public by first refusing to investigate flagrant law breaking, and now demanding any other investigations hide the most serious illegalities happening at Downing Street,"" she said.

""It's incredibly painful and they have let families like mine down. My husband was completely committed to justice, and he would have been appalled by this.""

Have internal disagreements led Met to change position?

When a police investigation into partygate was launched on Tuesday, the Met briefed journalists that they did not believe the full publication of the Gray report would prejudice their own investigation.

That position changed on Friday morning, with the force now requesting only ""minimal"" reference be made in the Gray report to events they are examining.

According to Sky's deputy political editor Sam Coates, senior officers are pointing towards an internal disagreement as the reason for the change.

He understands the police officers involved in the actual investigation have made it clear they object to the release of the full report, and insisted the force change its position as a result.

Number 10 says it hasn't asked Gray to go back to the Met

Downing Street said it has not asked Ms Gray's team to go back to the Met to make sure her report does not interfere with the police investigation.

A spokesman for the PM said: ""No, you'll be aware that the terms of reference clearly set out that the Cabinet Office would keep in contact with the police and again it's an independent investigation.

""We haven't been privy to the details of that investigation or any of its content. So that would be a matter for the investigations team and the Met.""

Asked if Number 10 had spoken with the Met about the Gray report and what could be published, the spokesman told journalists: ""Not that I'm aware of, no.""

Asked if it was correct that the Met's announcement had no involvement from No 10, he said: ""I believe that's correct.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220128170951/http://news.sky.com/story/partygate-met-police-wants-minimal-reference-in-sue-gray-report-to-events-it-is-investigating-12527038;

In a rare interview, Moderna's chief medical officer told Sky News that the Omicron wave had peaked in many countries and we are ""coming out of the pandemic phase"".

Dr Paul Burton warned the BA.2 subvariant that is already dominant in Denmark needs to be closely monitored, but the spring should bring relative stability.

However, he predicted Omicron would return as a significant threat next autumn - and Delta must not be forgotten.

He said: ""We think Omicron will still be here. This is a virus we can't eradicate anytime soon.

""Delta caused a lot of hospitalisation and death. Omicron causes a lot of that as well but it's more through bulk of infection.

""So what we have to do is be ready with a vaccine that can protect against all of that.

""Right now we're going with an Omicron booster but we think we may need to combine it with some Delta protection too.""

Moderna has recently begun clinical trials of an Omicron-specific booster.

But Dr Burton revealed that the company will soon begin tests of a super-booster that also protects against flu, which could become an annual ""winter tune-up"".

""I'm confident that we can get to a once yearly vaccine,"" he said.

""So then you can go to your pharmacy or doctor and get a single flu and COVID injection, get tuned up for winter, and get protected. And we'd hope to be able to bring that out in the winter of 2023.

""People don't like getting injections, it's inconvenience, it stings a bit.

""The more we can do to make it simple for people - a single shot - is very appealing.""

Dr Burton also said that resistance to the vaccine from high-profile figures such as Novak Djokovic needs to be countered with clear facts on the benefits of the jab.

""I think there's a lot of misinformation and a lot of confusion as well,"" he said.

""The fact that vaccination, with boosting, reduces your risk of dying and being hospitalised by 97% gets lost on people.

""If other people want to make choices and not get vaccinated, that's up to them. But the general public need to know the information and be confident.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220128170951/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-moderna-developing-single-booster-jab-to-protect-against-omicron-and-delta-variants-12527456;

Speaking at an event in Brussels, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday that the build-up of Russian troops at the borders with Ukraine and Belarus is not necessarily the only way Moscow plans to put pressure on Western allies.

""We need to be prepared for a wide range of different forms of aggression,"" he said, listing several examples.

It comes as Sky News' international editor Dominic Waghorn asked Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy whether he was playing down the threat of an imminent invasion to protect his country's economy and that the US was right to claim that a major border offensive was a ""real possibility"".

The leader replied: ""The question of the possible escalation is not less acute as (it is) for the US and other partners.""

But he added the conflict with Russia has been going on since 2014, saying Ukraine ""has been in this situation for eight years so we should be looking up but also looking on the ground"".

""We may lose the economy of our country, people come first. The probability of the threat is there. In 2021 it was the same, in 2020 it was less,"" he said.

He continued: ""Yes, it (an invasion) may happen unfortunately, but let's put three dots here, not just one full stop and say 'yes for sure it will happen'.""

Meanwhile, Russia has launched a series of military drills near its borders with both of its former Soviet neighbours.

The Kremlin is thought to be mobilising infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, alongside war planes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea and warships in the Black Sea and Arctic.

NATO has bolstered its presence in the Baltic Sea region in response, while the US has ordered a further 8,500 troops to be on high alert for deployment to eastern Europe.

Russia has repeatedly insisted it will not invade Ukraine, but foreign minister Sergei Lavrov warned on Friday: ""There won't be a war as far as it depends on the Russian Federation, we don't want a war.

""But we won't let our interests be rudely trampled on and ignored.""

Putin tells Macron Moscow's principal concerns not met

In a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, Vladimir Putin said that the US and NATO's proposals on security do not meet Moscow's main concerns.

But the Kremlin said Mr Putin would closely study the proposals before deciding on further action.

A build-up of as many as 150,000 Russian troops on the Ukrainian border began late last year as Russia demanded that Ukraine be banned from joining NATO and the alliance scales back its military operations in eastern Europe.

Moscow wants to keep its former Soviet neighbour in its 'sphere of influence' following its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Negotiations between Russia and the West last week proved largely unsuccessful, with US President Joe Biden telling Ukraine's President Zelenskyy in a phone call on Thursday that Russia could invade as soon as next month.

The US and NATO formally rejected Russia's demands this week but outlined a number of secondary areas where there could be room for negotiation and an opportunity to avoid full-scale war.

Earlier this month, Buckingham Palace announced Andrew would have his military titles and patronages removed.

He will also no longer style himself as His Royal Highness - HRH.

The statement read: ""With the Queen's approval and agreement, the Duke of York's military affiliations and Royal patronages have been returned to the Queen.

""The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.""

This now appears on the Royal Family's website, which previously only referred to his November 2019 statement.

Gusts could reach up to 80mph in exposed coastal areas, but more widely 60mph as the low pressure system passes over Northern Ireland, Scotland and the top half of England as it heads eastwards towards Denmark.

The warnings are in place between 4am on Saturday and noon on Monday.

Met Office chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: ""The impacts of Storm Malik are going to be greatest in Denmark on Sunday, but the track of the storm in the preceding hours means that the UK will be dealt a glancing blow as Malik moves eastwards on Saturday.

""For those in the North of the UK there will be high winds and rain on Saturday, with showers possibly turning wintry in the high ground in the North.

""The highest winds are expected in exposed coastal areas in the North and East of Scotland, but it will be a windy day for most.""

Further south, the weekend weather will feature some blustery winds, with some small amounts of rain.

The daily growth of infections was estimated at between -6% to -2%, compared with -6% to +1% the previous week.

Meanwhile, the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows infection rates and hospitalisations decreased across England in the week ending 23 January.

The infection rate fell to 4.82%, while hospitalisations of COVID patients decreased to 16.01 per 100,000 people.

Netflix is being accused of misrepresenting ""one of the most significant career achievements"" of female chess champion Nona Gaprindashvili in the series.

The Georgian chess player has taken issue with a line in the drama which her lawyers said had been broadcast ""before millions of viewers worldwide"" and ""tarnished (her) personal and professional reputation"".

The Queen's Gambit is about fictional chess player Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy), but frequent references are made to real-life figures from the game - including Gaprindashvili.

In the final episode of the series, a commentator during a chess game compares Harmon's achievements with that of Gaprindashvili's but says the real-life figure ""never faced men"" while playing - even though she did.

In its defence, Netflix said that ""no reasonable viewer would have understood the line to convey a statement of fact"" due the series being ""an entirely fictional work,"" according to legal documents obtained by the PA news agency.

It adds that for viewers to know that there is an alleged defamation, they would need a ""knowledge of competitive Soviet chess in the 1960s"".

However, in a court ruling on Thursday, a California Central District Court judge said that there was no evidence of ""precluding defamation claims for the portrayal of real persons in otherwise fictional works.

""On the contrary, the fact that the series was a fictional work does not insulate Netflix from liability for defamation if all the elements of defamation are otherwise present,"" the legal documents said.

Gaprindashvili's lawyers said that she was the first woman in history to be made an International Chess Grandmaster, adding: ""During Plaintiff's career, she encountered severe prejudice because she was a woman - and often the only woman - competing amongst men.

""When the series aired, multiple news outlets and various individual internet users commented on the inaccuracy of the line.

""Plaintiff states that the line 'misrepresented one of (her) most significant career achievements... before millions of viewers worldwide' and 'tarnished (her) personal and professional reputation'.""

They continued: ""Plaintiff's life-long career is in the world of competitive chess, in which she remains an active leader, role-model, and competitor.

""Plaintiff contends that the line cuts to the heart of her hard-won standing in her profession.

""The professional reputation and brand of Gaprindashvili was inextricably bound up with her courageous efforts to face and defeat estimable male opponents when chess was overwhelmingly a man's world.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220128170951/http://news.sky.com/story/netflix-to-face-the-queens-gambit-defamation-case-from-chess-grandmaster-12527281;

Among those with the highest rates of vaccination were:

• GPs and nurses - 87.2% of whom have had two jabs and a booster

• Head teachers - 86.8% of whom have had two jabs and a booster

In a written statement on Friday, education minister Michelle Donelan announced the salary threshold for student loan repayments in England will be frozen at the current levels of £27,295 per year, £2,274 a month or £524 a week for 2022-23.

But Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said the moves equates to a real-terms £150 increase in the amount students with loans will have to repay each year.

""That'll be a 6 or 7% real terms reduction and hence a real terms increase in repayments of c. £150 a year on graduates with student loans,"" Mr Johnson tweeted.

He added: ""Not an obvious response to 'cost of living crisis'.""

Labour's shadow universities minister Matt Western similarly noted: ""We have a cost of living crisis made in Downing Street, and whilst Number is in paralysis - (Chancellor) Rishi Sunak is raising taxes on millions of people.

""Labour has a plan to help hard-working families, including cutting VAT on energy bills, saving most households £200, paid for by a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producer profits.""

Image: Some experts said the freeze represents a real-terms £150 increase in the amount to be repaid each year

But Ms Donelan maintained in her statement that ""the system provides value for money for all of society at a time of rising costs"".

""It is now more crucial than ever that higher education is underpinned by just and sustainable finance and funding arrangements, and that the system provides value for money for all of society at a time of rising costs,"" Ms Donelan wrote.

""This government has already confirmed that we will freeze maximum tuition fee caps again for the 2022/23 academic year, the fifth year in succession that we have held fee caps at current levels.""

Loan repayments for post-graduate students will also be frozen at £21,000 per year, £1,750 a month or £404 a week in 2022-23.

It had been reported that, ahead of his budget, the chancellor was considering recommendations set out in the 2019 Augar review - which said deductions for student loan repayments should be applied once an individual earns £23,000 rather than the current rate of £27,295.

In October, a former Conservative education secretary called on Rishi Sunak to push ahead with proposals to lower the earning threshold for student loan repayments.

Lord Baker of Dorking, who served as education secretary under Margaret Thatcher, told Sky News he ""strongly"" supported the proposed reduction as ""would-be students should realise the obligation they will be taking on"".

The month before, another former Conservative minister said the earnings threshold should be lowered to tackle the ""depressing experience"" of student debt rising every year.

Lord Willetts, who oversaw a hike in tuition fees when he was universities minister, said at the time that a higher threshold ""particularly upsets"" parents of graduates who see their debt increase each year.

Ben Waltmann, senior research economist at the IFS, said the freeze ""effectively constitutes a tax rise by stealth on graduates with middling earnings"".

""Graduates with the lowest earnings do not reach the repayment threshold for student loans so they will be unaffected by the freeze. Those with the highest earnings will pay off their loans either way, so the freeze just means that they will repay their loans quicker,"" he said.

""For a graduate earning £30,000, this announcement means that they will pay £113 more towards their student loan in the next tax year than the government had previously said.""

But Nick Hillman, director at the Higher Education Policy Institute, described the move as ""sensible"".

""Few students or recent graduates will welcome this announcement but it is sensible because the current system has become out of kilter, with taxpayers paying much more than originally planned.

""It is also, however, a very modest and short-term announcement for just one year, reflecting the continuing failure to respond to the 2019 Augar report properly by setting out a long-term plan.""

Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, NUS vice-president for higher education, added: ""We were totally opposed to reducing the salary repayment threshold for student loans.

""So I suppose like thousands of others with their own stories, I'm angry about that.""

They were still waiting for their vaccines. I'm fortunate to have been double-vaccinated and boosted when I got COVID two weeks ago. Felt like a cold.

""The media needs to stop spotlighting opinions that are not rooted in facts or science.""

As a @UNICEFCanada ambassador I have seen the organization's efforts to deliver vaccines to underprivileged families around the world. It's a reminder of how lucky we are to be living in places where vaccine delivery and storage are not an issue. Please, PLEASE appreciate that. — Simu Liu (刘思慕) (@SimuLiu) January 28, 2022

And her Ant-Man colleague, David Dastmalchian, tweeted: ""It's so unfortunate when people with a large platform use that platform to share irresponsible things"".

Lilly is not the only Marvel star to cause controversy with regards to vaccine mandates - Black Panther actress Letitia Wright appeared to share an anti-vaccination video on social media last year following reports (which she denies) that she was sharing misinformation on the set of the film's sequel.

1947;1947;Highway Code: Everything you need to know as the road rules change from today;Saturday 29 January 2022 03:04, UK;[];['electric cars', 'highway code', 'cycling', 'roads'];['users', 'code', 'change', 'highway', 'know', 'pedestrians', 'today', 'road', 'way', 'waiting', 'updated', 'riding', 'cyclists', 'need', 'rules'];"A major overhaul of the Highway Code comes into force today in a bid to improve road safety for cyclists and pedestrians.

The new guidance includes a hierarchy of road users - with drivers expected to be aware of cyclists, pedestrians and horse riders.

Nine sections of the code have been updated with 50 rules added or amended - including motorists now expected to give way to people crossing or waiting to cross at a junction.

Here, Sky News outlines everything you need to know about the new Highway Code guidance.

People facing the greatest risk in the event of a collision - pedestrians and cyclists - will be prioritised above motorists, who have the most responsibility to consider others.

However, the new rules do not ""remove the need for everyone to behave responsibly"".

Image: New priority at junctions

Crossing junctions

Motorists and cyclists should give way when pedestrians are crossing or waiting to cross at a junction.

Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings and also parallel crossings - which include a cycle route alongside the black and white stripes.

Walking, cycling or riding in shared spaces

Cyclists should not overtake pedestrians or horse-riders closely or at high speed in shared spaces.

They should try and alert others of their presence, for example by ringing the bell, and anticipate people could be deaf, blind or partially sighted.

People walking should take care not to obstruct pathways.

Cyclist positioning

Cyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of their lane on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and when approaching junctions.

The guidance suggests it can be safer to ride ""two abreast"" or side by side, particularly when accompanying children or people with less experience.

Cyclists should be considerate of other road users particularly when in riding in groups.

The updated code explains they should exercise caution when passing parked vehicles, leaving around 1m to avoid being hit if a car door opens.

Opening car doors

Drivers and passengers should open doors using their hand on the opposite side - for example their left hand to open a door on their right.

The technique, known as the Dutch Reach, encourages people to turn their head and look over their shoulder - reducing the chance of a door opening in the path of others.

Roundabouts

Motorists should give priority to cyclists, horse riders and people driving horse-drawn vehicles and should not try to cut across their lane.

Image: The rules have been revamped in a bid to boost safety for cyclists and pedestrians

Overtaking

Drivers overtaking more vulnerable road users should leave at least 1.5 metres (5ft) when travelling at speeds of up to 30mph.

More space should be given when driving at higher speeds.

At least two metres distance should be left when passing people walking in the road, such as when there is no pavement.

Overtaking cyclists at junctions

Cyclists going straight ahead at a junction have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road markings indicate otherwise.

Charging electric vehicles

Motorists should park as close as possible to public charging points to avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing cables.

Image: An electric charging cable connected to a Jaguar I-Pace electric car at a residential home.

The rules are advisory so failing to comply will not result in a fine.

However concerns have been raised that the new guidance could have an adverse impact on safety.

AA president, Edmund King, said drivers are ""likely to get hit by another vehicle from behind"" if they stop on busy roads to allow someone to cross.

Pedestrians could also be put at risk if one vehicle gives way but another going in the opposite direction fails to stop.

Image: Nine sections of the Highway Code have been updated and 50 rules added or amended

It comes as an AA survey of 13,700 people found 33% were unaware of the changes, announced earlier this month - while 4% said they had ""no intention"" of reading them.

""Drivers will have to make their own judgements on what they should do in the scenarios they find themselves in,"" Mr King said.

He tweeted on Friday: ""Most people seem to understand it is about common sense, common courtesy and hopefully will bring a common cultural change.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220129030935/http://news.sky.com/story/highway-code-everything-you-need-to-know-as-the-road-rules-change-from-today-12527340;

Jim Justice performed the stunt as he took aim at his critics towards the end of his televised State of the State address on Friday.

Midler responded in a tweet by suggesting a dog's rear end would make a better governor than Mr Justice.

The actress and singer had been singled out by the 70-year-old Republican after she described the people of West Virginia as ""poor, illiterate and strung out"" in a tweet in December.

Midler was criticising the state's Democratic senator Joe Manchin for voting against President Joe Biden's signature ""Build Back Better"" plan.

Mr Justice hadn't forgotten her choice of words when he said during his speech on Friday: ""Absolutely too many people doubted us.

""They never believed in West Virginia... they told every bad joke in the world about us.""

He then picked up his bemused-looking English bulldog, named Babydog, and swung her backside towards the cameras as he said: ""And so from that standpoint, Babydog tells Bette Midler and all those out there, kiss her hiney!""

Mr Justice laughed as he received a round of applause.

Midler later posted a chart on Twitter which claims West Virginia falls behind most other states in key areas such as health and education.

She wrote: ""Here are the state rankings of all the areas and agencies for which the so-called 'Governor' of WVA, #JimJustice, is responsible. Judging from these rankings, I'd say his dog's a** would make a better governor than him!""

Midler had earlier retweeted a post which showed Mr Justice holding Babydog's rear in the air.

1949;1949;Britney Spears conservatorship: Star Trek icon Nichelle Nichols and pop-art pioneer Peter Max - is #FreeBritney just the beginning?;Saturday 29 January 2022 02:48, UK;['gemma peplow', '@gemmapeplow'];['britney spears', 'star trek'];['max', 'conservatorship', 'libra', 'nichelle', 'legal', 'star', 'case', 'trek', 'court', 'maxs', 'pioneer', 'peter', 'spears', 'nichols', 'icon', 'popart'];"In November 1968, the black actress Nichelle Nichols shared what was a milestone on-screen kiss with her white Star Trek co-star William Shatner.

While African-American actresses before her had often found themselves typecast in roles such as maids or housekeepers, Nichols' Lieutenant Uhura was light years ahead of her time. The kiss, aired just a year after the US Supreme Court had declared interracial marriage legal, was groundbreaking.

The star would often be asked in interviews about meeting Martin Luther King following the first series in 1966, and would recall with a twinkle in her eye how it was he who encouraged her to stick with Star Trek when she was thinking of leaving for Broadway. And Barack Obama once confirmed he had a crush on her when he was young, she cheekily told the world on Twitter in 2012.

A pioneer whose impressive CV doesn't stop with her acting career, Nichols also worked with NASA, helping to recruit women and those from ethnic minorities to become astronauts.

The meaning of the word ""uhura"" in Swahili is freedom, but there are some arguing that this is not the case for Nichols now. Aged 89 and suffering from dementia, she is sadly stuck in the middle of a legal fight that is gaining traction as the whole world is suddenly familiar with the word at the centre of it: conservatorship.

Britney Spears' case, famously brought to an end after almost 14 years at a momentous court hearing in November, has shone a spotlight on the thousands of others living under the legal agreements, also known as guardianships, across the US.

Spears, who was just 26 when her conservatorship was established, is a very different case to most, as the legal arrangements usually apply to much older people. However, the star's story has undoubtedly raised questions about how conservators should be appointed and assessed.

In the months before her case came to a head, the issue was also highlighted in the film I Care A Lot, starring Rosamund Pike, which told the story of an unscrupulous court-appointed guardian preying on her wealthy elderly wards.

Other celebrities who have lived under conservatorships include The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson in the 1990s, actor Mickey Rooney and US radio DJ Casey Kasem before their deaths, as well as actress Amanda Bynes more recently.

Guardianships that are disputed leave relatives, friends, associates at war - and those they are put in place to protect stuck in the middle, even if both sides do believe they have their loved-ones' best interests at heart. Nichols' case is one of them. Artist Peter Max, a US countercultural star of the 1960s and '70s whose art is said to be worth millions of dollars, is another.

Now, those seeking to ""free"" Nichols, Max and more have the support of the grass-roots campaigners who without question helped Spears' fight: #FreeBritney. In Max's case, his daughter has Spears' lawyer Mathew Rosengart on board, too.

How many people do conservatorships affect in the US?

According to a 2018 report by the US National Council On Disability, there were an estimated 1.3 million active adult guardianship or conservatorship cases in America at the time, with courts overseeing at least $50bn (about £37bn) of assets.

Each state has its own set of guardianship laws. According to the US Department of Justice, guardians are put in place by a court to make personal and/or financial and property decisions when an individual cannot make those decisions themselves. The aim is to protect the vulnerable - but should be a last resort, the DOJ says, as they remove an individual's legal rights and restrict independence.

US family and divorce lawyer Christopher Melcher, who is based in Los Angeles, says it is hard to know how many conservatorships run smoothly or not as most involved are not famous like Spears or Nichols or Max, so are not high-profile. However, he believes there are flaws in the system.

Image: #FreeBritney campaigners pictured outside the court on the day the star's conservatorship was lifted in November 2021

""A conservatorship is taking control from one adult and placing it in the hands of another,"" he says. ""That's done to protect the person, but then also provides the opportunity for abuse because this is done through a court order but the control is happening on a constant basis outside the presence of the court.

""There's going to be decisions made for this person. They're going to have their friends and family potentially excluded from them. They're going to have their bank account taken away from them.

""Another thing to understand is that we as adults have the right to make bad decisions. And so if our parent, our elderly parent, wants to give their money away or wants to be involved with a new romantic partner or wants to gamble it, they can do that. And the child who expects that inheritance, of course, is going to be anxious and want to keep that from happening. But if it's just poor decision making, that's not a basis for conservatorship.

""The only way that we can put a conservatorship over another is when they are subject to undue influence or fraud or unable to care for basic needs for food, clothing and shelter. It has to be at that level.""

Does this happen in the UK? In the UK, there is a similar law called a deputyship, in which someone is granted the ability to make decisions on behalf of someone lacking mental capacity. Under UK law, you can apply for a deputyship over someone who has severe brain damage or illness, dementia or severe learning disabilities, according to The University Of Law. This can also be granted under two types of deputies: property and financial affairs or personal wellbeing. However, the law in the UK is far more restricted than US conservatorship law, the university says.

#FreeNichelle

Outside the Stanley Mosk court house, the very same court house that heard Spears' case, protesters earlier in January rallied to #FreeNichelle, as they did for the singer for years.

Actress and producer Angelique Fawcette, a friend of Nichols', claims the star was forced into a conservatorship by her son, Kyle Johnson, also an actor, in 2018, which she describes as coercive.

Image: Nichols gave her friend Angelique Fawcette, who contests her conservatorship, away on her wedding day

She is supported by organisations including Kasem Cares, set up to help those fighting elder exploitation and isolation, of which she now is a board member; Secure Women, and the Touch Of Rose Project, born out of the #FreeBritney movement in order to help others.

Fawcette claims Nichols' money has been mishandled and that her home was sold against her will. There are also others who have fought the conservatorship separately.

Lawyers for Johnson did not respond to Sky News' requests for an interview. However, in a statement posted on a GoFundMe page, Nichols' younger sister, Marian Smothers, says it is not Johnson that her sibling needs protecting from, but others fighting the conservatorship. She set up the GoFundMe page to cover legal fees related to the case, which so far has raised more than $180,000.

It is a messy, complicated fight involving allegations from both sides that is now dominating Nichols' final years.

Fawcette's objections to the conservatorship were over-ruled at the court hearing earlier in January, but she has vowed to keep going. She claims Nichols, who gave her away at her wedding, asked her to ""have her back"" years before the legal agreement was put into place.

""I think that a lot of people, they tend to believe family because that's our culture. But what has occurred in Britney Spears' case is that we have now seen an actual case where the family members are not always working in a manner which would benefit the conservatee,"" she said.

An alternative to conservatorship

Fawcette concedes Nichols does need some help, but believes it does not need to be so controlled. ""I don't believe in conservatorship,"" she says. ""Conservatorship strips you of your human and civil rights, you have no say in anything that you want to do. I believe in supported decision making.""

#FreeBritney campaigner Megan Radford, one of the first to use the phrase back in 2009 as she believed even back then that all was not well with the star's conservatorship, is supporting Fawcette.

""The most gut-wrenching part of this whole thing to me is that she was truly a pioneer in the civil rights movement, with her role as Lieutenant Uhura and then her work recruiting minority scientists and astronauts for NASA,"" she says. ""She did all of this work to ensure the civil rights of other black Americans in this country and now she has been completely stripped of her own civil rights. It's not okay.""

#FreePeterMax

During his career, Peter Max has presented portraits to everyone from Bill Clinton and Taylor Swift, and has been the official artist for major events including the 1994 World Cup, the Grammys and the Super Bowl.

Photo agency archives show him pictured at gallery and social events with everyone from Yoko Ono to Prince Edward to Quincy Jones over the years, and his work has been featured on stamps, magazine covers and album sleeves by artists including Yes and Aretha Franklin.

Now 84 and suffering from dementia, he has been in a guardianship for several years but the problems started in 2019; in his case, his guardians are attorneys appointed by the court.

His son, Adam, supports the legal arrangement, while his daughter, Libra, is contesting it. The courts in New York have heard that Max consents to the guardianship and have so far denied his daughter's motions to end it.

In the latest development, Max's current personal guardian, Barbara Lissner, is suing Libra for defamation. Like Nichols' case, it is a hugely complex situation. Despite the lawsuit, Libra says she is still determined to speak out.

""My father has a loving family and a loving community,"" she tells Sky News. ""There is no one in his life that is a danger to him. There is absolutely no reason we should have the government in our life.""

Initially, Libra Max was happy with her father's conservatorship, and says it worked well with the guardian who was initially appointed. However, when his original conservator retired, things changed, she claims. She says she and her brother, Adam, are now only able to see their father on supervised visits. Adam, however, supports the guardianship and says Ms Lissner is doing a ""wonderful job"".

Image: Max pictured at his studio in New York in 1986. Pic: AP

He says visits are regular and it is not that they are supervised, but rather it is ""medically necessary"" for caregivers to be on hand ""to be near him and watching him"".

Larry Flynn, who was appointed Max's property guardian in 2016, says the legal arrangement worked well for years and that there are ""no grounds to remove Ms Lissner, she's doing a fine job"".

The ""elephant in the room"", he says, is Peter Max's artwork, which he says is worth millions of dollars, and that he has worked on many guardianships but never seen one before ""where the manner in which people are approaching it is so dysfunctional"".

In a statement sent to Sky News, Phillips Nizer, the law firm appointed to represent Max's interests, said Libra Max's claims are ""demonstrably false"" and that Elizabeth Adinolfi, his court-appointed attorney ""would be the first to object if Peter's safety or well-being were at risk"".

Like Fawcette, Libra Max has shared videos of her father, which seem to suggest he does not want the conservatorship, on a #FreePeterMax channel on YouTube.

Image: Matthew Rosengart, the lawyer who took over Spears' case, signed up to the team trying to end Peter's Max's conservatorship following his result with the star

However, Phillips Nizer said that Max had ""expressed his preference for independent court-guardians"".

They continued: ""The independent court-appointed guardians are doing an extraordinary job under challenging circumstances, which include the ongoing efforts by Libra Max to disrupt the guardianship. To date, no court has validated her claims or granted her requests.""

The movement started by #FreeBritney

Teresa Kennedy, from the organisation Elder Dignity, says the question of why a conservatee should have to be isolated from family and friends, regardless of whether they need help with finances or not, often goes unanswered.

""Whether it's complicit or complacency, it doesn't really matter,"" she says, because those in power often ""won't listen to the 'crazy' family member"".

Image: Peter Max met Spears early in her career. Pic: Libra Max

She continues: ""You have to ask the question: if this was a child and there was any question about the child's guardian, wouldn't that guardian be removed?""

Coincidentally, Libra Max says her father met Spears after painting a portrait of the star early in her career, before either of them were living under conservatorships. Libra says Spears' case has ""given me a voice"".

Both Adam Max's lawyer Robert Johnson and Mr Flynn say Max's case is ""nothing like"" the Spears case.

""Britney is only 40 years old,"" Mr Johnson said. ""It's clear from her public appearance and public comments that she really didn't need a guardian or a conservatorship... Peter is an older man, so the necessity for a guardianship is a completely different scenario.""

But Libra Max says the outcome of Spears' case proves people were wrong to dismiss the star's fans. ""I think there's a lot more awareness now because of Britney,"" she says. ""[#FreeBritney campaigners] were sort of discredited as just 'crazy fans'. But they really started a very powerful, important social justice movement, a human rights movement.

""It's not in my nature to go public, I knew I was going to get backlash. It's whistleblower retaliation. It was very frightening and it was a hard decision. But the only thing that is going to solve this is exposure - just like Britney.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220129030935/http://news.sky.com/story/britney-spears-conservatorship-star-trek-icon-nichelle-nichols-and-pop-art-pioneer-peter-max-is-freebritney-just-the-beginning-12526790;
1952;1952;'I became the devil': The trauma of the woman wrongly suspected of murdering an entire family in Clydach;Saturday 29 January 2022 03:25, UK;['david mercer', '@davidmercersky'];['wales'];['woman', 'morris', 'family', 'alison', 'wrongly', 'mandy', 'lewis', 'murdering', 'trauma', 'crime', 'clydach', 'suspected', 'devil', 'murders', 'welsh', 'entire', 'morriss'];"As an angry mob gathered outside a police station, Alison Lewis thought she was going to be killed.

The former Welsh women's rugby international, and ex-policewoman, had been arrested over the brutal killings of three generations of the same family - and a ""baying, screaming"" crowd was waiting for her.

After four days of intense questioning on suspicion of the quadruple murder in Clydach, South Wales, Alison was released on bail and hid in the back of a car as she left the station.

Image: Alison Lewis pictured in 2002

""I became the devil,"" she tells a new documentary.

""That's all they wanted was my blood.

""I remember lying on the floor of the car thinking: 'I'm going to die here in the back of this car and I won't be able to prove I'm innocent'.

""I really thought I was going to be killed.""

A year before her arrest, Alison's lover Mandy Power had been found dead along with Mandy's mother Doris and daughters, Katie, 10, and Emily, aged eight.

Image: Mandy Power and her daughters Katie and Emily were murdered

The family had been bludgeoned to death with a pole in an ""orgy of savagery"", prosecutors said, before their house was set on fire in June 1999.

Now, a new four-part series takes a forensic look at the biggest murder investigation in Welsh history - with Alison agreeing to a TV interview about the case for the first time in more than a decade.

Image: Mandy Power's mother Doris Dawson was killed

Filmmaker Owen Phillips, who went to school near Clydach at the time of the murders, said the early media focus on Alison was partly because of her ""unorthodox"" relationship with Mandy and her martial arts training, which included a black belt in karate.

He tells Sky News: ""The headlines were obsessed with Alison because she was a black belt, she was a Welsh rugby international, she'd been a police officer - all those things were tantalising for journalists.

""I feel for Alison. She said she loved Mandy. They were preparing to have a life together.

""She had the trauma of the murder and then she was a suspect.""

Image: Alison Lewis gave evidence during a trial over the murders

At the time of her affair with Mandy, Alison was married to Stephen Lewis, an officer with South Wales Police, who was also arrested on suspicion of the murders.

His twin brother Stuart, who was a police officer too, was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.

They were all released without charge.

Former builder David ""Dai"" Morris - who claimed he had a fling with Mandy - was eventually convicted of the murders and spent 22 years in jail before his death in August last year.

A blood-stained gold chain found at the crime scene had led police to Morris, with paint found on the jewellery matching paint used on kitchen cabinets at his flat.

Morris always protested his innocence and his family have vowed to clear his name.

""They completely believe he didn't do it and they'll say it's not a question of blind faith,"" Phillips says of Morris's family.

""They can't let it go - if they did, they'd feel like it was a betrayal.

""The police and the family of Mandy Power 100% think David Morris is guilty and would like this to go away.

""It's torn the community apart. People are entrenched in their views about who did it.""

Image: Morris's sister Debra Thomas has long protested her brother's innocence

The Clydach murders investigation was the largest and most complex homicide probe ever undertaken by a Welsh police force.

Morris was convicted of the murders in 2002 - but the verdict was quashed on appeal due to a conflict of interest by a defence solicitor.

However he was convicted again during a retrial in 2006 and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

A BBC documentary in 2020 questioned the safety of the conviction after it featured interviews with two potential witnesses.

Image: Morris died in August 2021

But after the documentary aired, South Wales Police said no information had been provided that undermined Morris's conviction.

Following a forensic review of the case material, the force revealed in October that a blood-stained sock found at a crime scene linked Morris to the murders.

The sock, widely believed to have been used by Morris during the killings, identified the presence of DNA that linked him or a male relative on his paternal side to the crime scene.

The development prompted a rare statement from Mandy's family who called on Morris's supporters to accept his guilt.

They said: ""The loss and grief our family went through and continue to go through is heart-breaking and affects so many aspects of lives.

""No family should ever go through what we have and still do.""

Image: A gold chain led police to Morris

Phillips, who has previously worked on the documentaries Barrymore: Body In The Pool and Leaving Neverland, hopes his new series will finally address ""what really happened that night in the summer of 1999 in Clydach"".

""Those sort of things don't really happen in those sort of communities - close-knit, industrial communities,"" he says.

""Everybody knows everybody, it's gossipy - so when it happened it was like an atom bomb for the whole community and all the surrounding towns and villages because of the brutality and the strangeness.

""For 12 months, there were no arrests. You can imagine the fear and paranoia that was happening where people were worried about who could have committed these murders.

""As well as it being an interesting case with extraordinary details, I think there is a legitimate reason for opening this up and looking at it again.

""One of the difficult things is separating the fact and fiction, the gossip from the truth.""

Last week, Mr Johnson asked defence and security chiefs to consider further defensive military options in Europe during a high-level intelligence briefing.

This weekend, he will consider a range of options to alleviate Russian aggression in the region, including further deployments and bolstering NATO's defences.

Tougher sanctions are expected to be announced by the Foreign Office on Monday, allowing the UK to target Russia's strategic and financial interests.

""He has said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months.""

Chris Philp, a minister in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, told Sky News there is ""deep concern"" about the ""unprecedented"" build-up of Russian troops on the border, particularly after units from the east of Russia redeployed to the region.

The civil lawsuit was filed by a musician, dancer and choreographer identified only as Jane Doe, who is suing the Grammy-winning singer for $20m (£15m) in damages.

The allegation

It says she was invited by Brown to meet him at Star Island in Miami - the home of Sean Combs, better known as P Diddy - in December 2020.

The filing said when she arrived she boarded a yacht and accepted Brown's offer of a drink as they discussed her career.

But after a second drink, the woman suddenly began to feel disoriented and physically unstable.

She said Brown then dragged her to a bedroom, removed her clothing and had sex with her without her consent, according to the lawsuit.

Brown's response

Brown posted on Instagram: ""Whenever I'm releasing music or projects, 'THEY' try to pull some real bulls**t.""

His post included a blue cap emoji, which is used as slang to indicate someone is lying.

In her lawsuit, the woman said Brown phoned her the next day and told her to take an emergency contraceptive pill.

She allegedly saw Brown twice after the encounter.

The complaint says at one of those meetings he became ""irate"" when she turned down an invitation to his bedroom.

The lawsuit, which was filed in Los Angeles Crown Court, said the woman has experienced ""dramatic mood swings, loss of appetite, panic attacks and has engaged in self harm"".

She is seeking a jury trial.

Previous legal troubles

Brown pleaded guilty to assaulting singer Rihanna when the pair were dating in 2009. He was sentenced to five years of probation, community service and counselling for domestic violence.

He was also accused of raping a woman in a hotel room in Paris in 2019. The singer denied the allegation and filed a defamation complaint against the accuser, and no charges were filed.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220129051004/https://news.sky.com/story/chris-brown-accused-of-drugging-and-raping-woman-on-florida-yacht-12527813;
1956;1956;'He absolutely will do it': Why Putin seems poised to attack Ukraine - after one of surest signs yet;Saturday 29 January 2022 10:10, UK;['deborah haynes', '@haynesdeborah'];['russia', 'ukraine'];['president', 'surest', 'signs', 'nato', 'russia', 'poised', 'russian', 'putin', 'attack', 'expert', 'ukraine', 'military', 'western', 'way', 'absolutely'];"Surprise and shock; maximum lethal force; and objectives secured with speed - that is what could be expected if Russia's military launches a new invasion of Ukraine, according to a well-regarded defence and security expert.

There is still no certainty that Russian President Vladimir Putin will opt for new military action but Britain, the United States and other NATO allies appear increasingly concerned that hostilities are more likely than a negotiated solution to the crisis.

""Right now, he holds all the cards. I think he absolutely will do it,"" one western military officer, who has been analysing the situation, said.

Why is Russia worried about NATO - and what does it have to do with Ukraine?

Image: Vladimir Putin has consistently denied any plans to launch a further invasion of Ukraine

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused the West of inciting ""panic"" with their warnings of an imminent invasion.

Yet the reality on the ground is hard to ignore - unless it really is a highly elaborate bluff.

A mobilisation of Russian troops and weaponry around Ukraine's borders has continued to expand - now numbering some 130,000 military personnel - despite condemnation by western allies and pressure on the Kremlin to drawdown.

In one of the surest indicators the Russian military is preparing to attack rather than simply conducting training exercises, the Reuters news agency reported that supplies of blood and other medical materials to treat casualties were forming part of the Russian build-up.

President Putin has consistently denied any plans to launch a further invasion of Ukraine - though he had also denied any involvement in Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 until it was a fait accompli.

He has instead, this time, accused NATO of posing a security threat to Russia, while issuing demands to allies to pull all NATO troops out of eastern and central European countries that were once in the then Soviet Union's sphere of influence.

The Russian leader also wants the alliance to guarantee no further expansion eastwards, such as allowing Ukraine to join the club.

NATO has made clear such requests will be impossible to meet but diplomats have spent weeks trying to come up with a way to bridge the ideological gap between the two sides.

Talks are continuing, with Boris Johnson the latest western leader due to hold a call with President Putin this coming week.

Yet the British defence and security expert - whose opinion is highly regarded on Russia's way of war but who asked to remain anonymous to be able to share their thoughts more freely - pointed to increasingly threatening rhetoric from the Russian side, the intensification of troop movements and the use of ""maskirovka"" (military and political deception).

""We may be reaching the point when Putin considers that the Western position will not now change sufficiently to enable him to get what he wants without invasion,"" the expert wrote in a note seen by Sky News.

This calculation could of course change were the United States and its allies to suddenly capitulate.

It could be altered - in a different way - by a ""rapid deployment of US forces to Eastern Europe and a credible promise to defend Ukraine, coupled with credible threat of draconian sanctions on Russia,"" the expert said.

The expert said the West was ""somewhere between these two stools"".

Image: A Ukrainian soldier cleans his position in a trench on the front line in the Luhansk region. Pic: AP

US President Joe Biden said on Friday he would be moving US troops to Eastern European NATO countries ""in the near term"" but there has consistently been no indication from the US, the UK or others that they are ready to put forces into Ukraine other than as military trainers.

""Putin can see that our publicly expressed position is hollow. It is no deterrent to his taking military action because there is no strong political will to act and no adequate military ability to do so in any meaningful way either. To Putin, we are seen to lack the necessary moral fibre,"" the expert wrote.

""So, that lack of moral fibre, which till now has encouraged Putin to believe that he could win without a shooting war, will now encourage him to feel that he can win the shooting war if he feels the need to start it.

""At this point, Russian military doctrine comes into play directly. This prescribes: achieving surprise and shock; maximum use of all lethal force available; rapid tempo of operations; and quick achievement of the decisive objectives of the operation.""

The expert said that objectives of any operation may not include the physical occupation of all of Ukraine.

""But they must include the destruction of Ukraine's capability to offer military resistance, the replacement of its government system, and the prevention of its receiving external help,"" the expert added.

Other analysts though believe that President Putin may choose a more limited, less risky option but one that still secures gains and projects strength - such as securing control of eastern parts of Ukraine already held by Russia-backed separatists.

The expert said: ""The Russian military operation will, of course, be accompanied by a ramped-up political operation, massive disinformation campaign, economic warfare (such as with gas, wheat), all cloaked in maskirovka.

Researchers used the colourless, odourless, tasteless and chemically non-reactive gas xenon to investigate possible lung damage in patients who have not been admitted to hospital but still experience the symptom.

Initial results of the Explain study suggest there is significantly impaired gas transfer in the lungs to the bloodstream in long COVID patients - despite other tests including CT scans coming back normal.

MRI scans detect abnormalities in long COVID patients

Fergus Gleeson, the study's chief investigator, as well as professor of radiology at the University of Oxford and consultant radiologist at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""We knew from our post-hospital COVID study that xenon could detect abnormalities when the CT scan and other lung function tests are normal.

""What we've found now is that, even though their CT scans are normal, the xenon MRI scans have detected similar abnormalities in patients with long COVID.

""These patients have never been in hospital and did not have an acute severe illness when they had their COVID-19 infection.

""Some of them have been experiencing their symptoms for a year after contracting COVID-19.

""There are now important questions to answer. Such as, how many patients with long COVID will have abnormal scans, the significance of the abnormality we've detected, the cause of the abnormality, and its longer-term consequences.

""Once we understand the mechanisms driving these symptoms, we will be better placed to develop more effective treatments.""

Radiologists observe how xenon moves from lungs into bloodstream

Patients lay in an MRI scanner and breathed one litre of xenon, which had been altered so it could be seen using MRI.

The gas, which is safe to inhale, behaves similarly to oxygen, allowing radiologists to observe how it moves from the lungs and into the bloodstream.

The pilot study had 36 participants split into three groups. The full Explain study will recruit around 400 participants.

The groups included patients diagnosed with long COVID who had been to long COVID studies and had normal CT scans, people who had been in hospital with coronavirus and discharged more than three weeks ago and who had normal or nearly normal CT scans and who were not experiencing long COVID.

The third group was an age and gender-matched control group who had no long COVID symptoms and had not been admitted to hospital with the virus.

Dr Emily Fraser, respiratory consultant who leads the Oxford Post-COVID Assessment Clinic, said people should not give up on the current exercises and rehab work they are doing.

1961;1961;Why is Russia worried about NATO - and what does it have to do with Ukraine?;Saturday 29 January 2022 05:32, UK;['kieran devine', '@kierand99'];['data and forensics', 'nato', 'ukraine'];['nations', 'russia', 'worried', 'nato', 'members', 'sky', 'russian', 'does', 'ukraine', 'troops', 'weapons', 'germany'];"Ukraine is caught in the middle of a tussle between NATO and Russia which will have profound effects on geopolitics for years to come, according to an expert who spoke to Sky News.

The crisis, which has seen Russian troops mass on the Ukrainian border, is exposing differences between NATO members, with Germany even blocking the export of some weapons to Ukraine in recent days.

So what exactly is NATO and is Russia right to be worried about it?

The history

Founded in 1949, the 12 original members of NATO struck a treaty that meant if any members were attacked, all members would seek to come to their assistance in collective defence. In the 1950s NATO allies formed a bloc against countries aligned with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, such as Warsaw Pact nations like East Germany and Poland. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 a group of non-aligned countries separated Russia from NATO members. But by 2020 NATO had expanded to include Poland, Romania, and the Baltic nations amongst others, while Russia had formed what it called the CSTO alliance with Belarus and several other nations.

Russian demands

Russia has demanded that NATO guarantees Ukraine will never join the alliance, something the organisation couldn't realistically offer, according to Ed Arnold, a research fellow at the defence think tank RUSI.

He also believes the view that NATO is ""encircling"" Russia and posing a threat is misguided:

""Very little of Russia's landmass is actually bordered by NATO… which is fundamentally a defensive alliance. European nations don't really want to have to station troops in eastern Europe, as it's expensive.

""Russia's actions are more about trying to project itself as a great power again.""

Even if NATO members don't want to have to supply troops and weapons, some have come to Ukraine's aid in light of the Russian build-up.

NATO's response

Use the arrows below to scroll through the maps:

Will the equipment make a difference?

Much of the weaponry sent comes in the form of anti-tank missiles. However, according to Sam Cranny-Evans, a military science analyst at RUSI, the weapons will have only a minor effect should Russia take action.

""Russia will likely conduct 'non-contact warfare' initially should they engage, meaning they will operate at long-range using cruise missiles and reconnaissance assets to find targets. NLAWs, the weapons the UK have provided, are only effective at around 800 metres - that's not going to deter Russia.""

Image: A Ukrainian service member holds a next-generation light anti-tank weapon (NLAW), supplied by Britain

But the sending of weapons is likely to have a second effect - by signalling how committed some countries are in confronting Russia and shoring up NATO.

The German reluctance to grant the export of Estonian artillery would appear to show a divergence in this regard.

Some have pointed to the importance of Russian natural gas imports to Germany to explain this decision.

But Germany is not alone in failing to send weaponry. Canada has also declined, despite having supported Ukraine with over £500m of military training and humanitarian aid since 2014.

These decisions may reflect differences of opinion over whether a show of force or de-escalation are the best ways to confront the Russian threat.

Regardless of how unified NATO members are, Ed Arnold is clear that the situation will leave lasting effects:

""There's going to be probably fairly major changes in the next couple of years due to this… NATO and the EU might sort themselves out once and for all, as Russia is the most acute threat to Europe since the Cold War and it's not going away.""

Meanwhile, the publication of the long-awaited Gray report - which could decide the PM's future - was thrown into disarray on Thursday when Dame Cressida Dick said her officers had opened a criminal inquiry.

The force has been accused of watering down the report as it asked Ms Gray to make only ""minimal reference"" to No 10 events which are subject to a criminal investigation, buying more time for Mr Johnson.

Lawyers have also criticised the Met's response, and some have questioned how the Met's investigation could be prejudiced if only lesser offences were being considered.

Publication of reports and other inquiries can often be delayed until a police investigation and any court case is concluded, typically to avoid prejudicing a jury.

However, if police investigate under coronavirus laws there would be little risk as the penalty for breaking lockdown rules is a fine and highly unlikely to result in prosecution.

Nazir Afzal, a former chief Crown prosecutor for the North West, said on Twitter: ""This is absolute nonsense from the Met Police.

The former zookeeper's jail term was shortened by one year following his conviction for trying to hire two different men to kill animal welfare activist Carole Baskin.

Exotic - whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage - was originally sentenced in 2020 to 22 years in prison.

Wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, the 58-year-old still had his trademark mullet hairstyle, but the bleach-blonde was fading to grey.

Baskin and her husband also attended the proceedings, and she said she was fearful that Exotic could threaten her.

""He continues to harbour intense feelings of ill will toward me,"" she said.

Both Exotic and Baskin starred in the Netflix documentary Tiger King which became an international hit in 2020, with a second series released last year.

Exotic's supporters packed the courtroom on Friday, some wearing animal-print masks and shirts that read Free Joe Exotic.

His lawyers said they would appeal against both the resentencing and petition for a new trial.

The latest hearing came after a federal appeals court ruled last year that Exotic's prison term should be shortened.

The appeal judges agreed with Exotic that his two separate murder-for-hire convictions should be treated as one, because both had the aim of arranging Ms Baskin's death.

Baskin runs a rescue sanctuary for big cats in Florida and had criticised Exotic's treatment of animals.

Prosecutors said Exotic offered $10,000 to an undercover FBI agent to kill Baskin during a recorded December 2017 meeting.

In the recording, he told the agent: ""Just like follow her into a mall parking lot and just cap her and drive off.""

Neighbouring Cleethorpes - a bellwether seat - also voted Conservative.

How voters view partygate will be crucial in places like these Lincolnshire constituencies - along with their perceptions of Boris Johnson and whether he broke the rules he made and is fit for office.

But in Great Grimsby, the sense of great expectation exuded by Westminster in anticipation of the Sue Gray report is hard to find.

And the overwhelming message is that people are tired of hearing about partygate and want to move on with their lives after the trauma of the pandemic.

The fish market

Grimsby's fishing heyday has long gone. On the day we visited the fish market, they were selling cod and haddock to traders - and all of it had come from Iceland. But there seemed little interest in the forthcoming Gray report.

Martin Boyers, chief executive of Grimsby Fish Market, said: ""I don't think many people at Grimsby Fish Market are interested in the Sue Gray report or understand who she is.""

Boris Johnson visited the fish market on the campaign trail in 2019, and he impressed traders with his Brexit message.

Patrick Salmon, owner of Alfred Enderby fish smokers, said: ""Whether somebody has a party, it doesn't affect my economy or my businesses.

""Yes, it's bad form, but I'm not convinced any other person would have done any differently.""

I asked them if they personally knew anyone who was angry with Mr Johnson over allegations of ""bring your own bottles of booze"" gatherings and other alleged lockdown breaches. They all chorused: ""No.""

But Mr Waters, from Grimsby, raised the spectre that there will be people in this part of the world for whom partygate will cost the Conservative Party votes.

Mr Waters says he's never voted in his life, apart from for Brexit.

But he says: ""I think there's a lot of people who will not vote for him again because of everything that's happened. He's done a good job on other things, and there's more pressing things in the world now than talking about garden parties and cakes. It's what he does for the country, not when he's at home.""

1967;1967;Pregnant New Zealand journalist says she's had to turn to Taliban for help after being denied entry to home country;Saturday 29 January 2022 20:20, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];['taliban', 'new zealand'];['zealand', 'country', 'help', 'shes', 'told', 'pic', 'jim', 'bellis', 'ms', 'denied', 'pregnant', 'married', 'turn', 'journalist', 'entry', 'taliban'];"A pregnant New Zealand journalist has said she had to turn to the Taliban for help after being locked out of her home country due to its strict coronavirus rules.

Charlotte Bellis, who worked for Al Jazeera, said it was ""brutally ironic"" that she had once questioned the Taliban about their treatment of women and girls and was now asking the same question of her own government.

""When the Taliban offers you - a pregnant, unmarried woman - safe haven, you know your situation is messed up,"" she wrote in the New Zealand Herald.

New Zealand has imposed some of the strictest lockdowns in the world, shutting its borders and reporting just 52 virus deaths among its five million population.

The country requires returning citizens to spend 10 days in military-run quarantine hotels. Stories of citizens stranded abroad in dire circumstances have caused embarrassment for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

Ms Bellis said her ""miracle"" daughter was conceived a week after she attended the Taliban's first press conference since they took power.

For years she had been told by doctors she could not have children, then ""during the fall of Kabul, a miracle"".

She realised she was pregnant with her partner, freelance photographer Jim Huylebroek, a contributor to The New York Times, days after returning to Qatar - where it is illegal to be pregnant and unmarried.

It was here that she was told by a doctor in Qatar: ""I can't treat you and I can only say you need to get married or get out of the country as soon as possible.""

Ms Bellis repeatedly tried to get back into New Zealand, waking up at 3am daily to try the country's lottery-style system, but without success.

She resigned from Al Jazeera in November and the couple moved to Mr Huylebroek's native Belgium, but she was only to stay a matter of months because she was not a resident.

The only other place the couple had visas to live was Afghanistan.

She wrote: ""I organised a meeting with senior Taliban contacts, ""you know how I am dating Jim from The New York Times, but we're not married, right?""

""Yes, yes we respect you both and you are foreigners, that is up to you. I nervously continued. ""Well, I am pregnant and I can't get back into New Zealand. If I come to Kabul, will we have a problem?""

Image: Ms Bellis worked for Al Jazeera covering Afghanistan. Pic: Jim Huylebroek

""One translated for the other and they smiled.""

They then told her: ""Just tell people you're married and if it escalates, call us. Don't worry. Everything will be fine.""

She claims she sent 59 documents to New Zealand authorities requesting an emergency return, but her application was rejected.

Chris Bunny, the joint head of New Zealand's Managed Isolation and Quarantine system, told the Herald that Ms Bellis's emergency application did not fit a requirement that she travel within 14 days.

He said staff had reached out to her about making another application that would fit the requirements.

However, Ms Bellis said on Twitter: ""Our rejection email states even if we apply within 14 days, we have no evidence that we need time-critical treatment.""

As she awaits a final decision on whether or not she can return, being pregnant in Afghanistan ""can be a death sentence"".

Ms Bellis said she had wanted to leave by 30 weeks for fear of her daughter coming early, ""in which case the treatment would likely be a warm blanket and a prayer.""

Kay Duddy, 75, says her brother Jackie, 17, cannot rest until that happens and is directly appealing to former members of the British Parachute Regiment.

She said: ""Please put your hands up and say you did it, so we can lay our wee brother to rest.

""My wee brother, Jackie Duddy, has been buried for 50 years but up to this minute in time, he hasn't been laid to rest.

""How can you lay somebody to rest without justice for what happened that awful day?""

Thirteen people were shot dead when members of the Parachute Regiment opened fire following a civil rights march in Londonderry on 30 January 1972.

Only one suspect - identified as ""Soldier F"" - was ever charged. He was facing prosecution for double murder, but the case collapsed before it had begun.

Colum Eastwood, the local MP and leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), said: ""The idea that unarmed people, marching for their own civil rights, for justice and democracy, were gunned down on their own streets by a special forces regiment is beyond belief.

""It's beyond belief that it was allowed to happen, that it was lied about, that it was covered up for decades after decades.""

The victims were exonerated by a lengthy and costly public inquiry and David Cameron, the then prime minister, apologised following its publication in 2010.

The current government's plan to halt historical prosecutions has caused deep hurt here, where the lack of justice still haunts this community.

Freya McClements, Northern Ireland editor of the Irish Times and a native of Derry, said: ""Imagine if this happened in London or Liverpool or Manchester or Birmingham.

""This is why Bloody Sunday has had this long tale that has impacted not just on the families and on the city, but on the troubles and how that developed.

""Bloody Sunday was absolutely the cataclysmic turning point that sent Northern Ireland tumbling into decades of violence.""

To mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, the city will fall silent at the precise moment the first British Army shot rang out.

Television footage of a priest waving a blood-stained handkerchief as he sought help for a wounded teenager became the defining image of the day.

That teenager was Jackie Duddy - and although five decades have passed, his sister Kay thinks about him ""every day"" of her life.

""That awful day, we didn't lose a brother. We lost a generation,"" she said.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220129200941/http://news.sky.com/story/bloody-sunday-grieving-sister-appeals-to-her-brothers-killer-on-50th-anniversary-12528147;

""Those who want to leave can do so but they need to do it now,"" she told followers at a meeting of European far-right leaders in Madrid.

""Having people here while their heart or their mind is elsewhere is unbearable.

Image: Marine Le Pen and her niece Marion Marechal in 2016

""It is a total lack of dignity and respect towards all of our supporters.""

It comes as her niece voiced approval for Ms Le Pen's rival Eric Zemmour, saying he was a better candidate for the country's presidential election.

Her niece, Marion Marechal, made the comments in an interview with French newspaper Le Parisien, saying her aunt showed a ""lack of logic and vision"".

Ms Marechal is herself a popular figure among far-right voters, and an ideological divide between the two has been speculated about for years.

She is reportedly considering joining Mr Zemmour's party, which holds more extreme views on issues like immigration.

Ms Le Pen's party National Rally - formerly National Front - had already suffered the defection of two EU lawmakers.

A tussle on the far-right

Image: Eric Zemmour and Marine Le Pen are two far right candidates challenging Emmanuel Macron for the French presidency

Ms Le Pen is placing second or third in opinion polls, as both her and Mr Zemmour battle for the support of nationalist voters in a bid to face current president, Emmanuel Macron, in the next round.

Her father led National Rally for years until she took over in 2011, with the party dominating far-right politics for decades, but it has failed to achieve major electoral success.

Ms Le Pen will be hoping to improve on regional election results last year, which saw her party fail to win any of mainland France's 12 regions.

Mr Zemmour, a far-right TV pundit, entered the race in November, and has since voiced anti-Islam and anti-migrant views.

This month, he was fined €10,000 (£8,350) for hate speech over remarks made on a right-wing TV channel in which he called young migrants killers, thieves and rapists in 2020.

He said he would appeal the decision.

European Parliament member Gilbert Collard joined Mr Zemmour's Reconquest party from National Rally in a sign the TV pundit's entrance into the race could split the hard-right vote, with more extreme voters attracted to his radical views.

Macron likely to seek re-election

Image: Emmanuel Macron looks likely to win re-election according to polls

Mr Macron is leading polls, however, and is expected to win the 2022 election comfortably.

This is despite also performing poorly in the country's regional elections with the ruling Republique en Marche party failing to win a single region outright.

Most candidates voiced frustration at low turnout, with only 33% of France's voting population taking part.

The incumbent is yet to formally confirm he will seek re-election with the announcement expected soon.

This year, protests broke out when Mr Macron said he wanted to ""p*** off"" people who had not been vaccinated against COVID-19.

Mr Johnson is under pressure from some Conservative MPs to scrap or at least delay the increase to win back support as he awaits the findings of Whitehall and police inquiries into claims of lockdown-busting parties held in Downing Street.

But Mr Johnson, together with Chancellor Rishi Sunak, has now made a firm commitment to go ahead with the 1.25 percentage point increase in April, which they say will tackle backlogs in the NHS caused by the pandemic and reform social care.

Writing in The Sunday Times, they hailed the ""progressive"" policy and insisted there was ""no magic money tree"" to provide the needed funding.

""We must clear the COVID backlogs, with our plan for health and social care - and now is the time to stick to that plan. We must go ahead with the health and care levy. It is the right plan,"" they said.

""It is progressive, in the sense that the burden falls most on those who can most afford it.

""Every single penny of that £39 billion will go on these crucial objectives - including nine million more checks, scans and operations, and 50,000 more nurses, as well as boosting social care.""

Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak said they are both ""tax-cutting Conservatives"" and said they ""believe passionately that people are the best judges of how to spend their own money"".

""We want to get through this Covid-driven phase, and get on with our agenda, of taking advantage of our new post-Brexit freedoms to turn the UK into the enterprise centre of Europe and the world.

""We want lighter, better, simpler regulation, especially in those new technologies in which the UK excels. We are also Thatcherites, in the sense that we believe in sound money. There is no magic money tree.""

In April, national insurance is due to rise by 1.25 percentage points for workers and employers.

From 2023, it is due to drop back to its current rate, with a 1.25% health and social care levy then applied to raise funds for improvements to care services.

Political opposition to the change has come from all sides of the Commons, as MPs fear the impact that cost of living pressures could have on stretched household budgets.

Both were taken to Royal Stoke University Hospital, where the boy passed away and the man remains for treatment.

Staffordshire Police said people should avoid the area. The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner, the force added.

It was confirmed earlier that a 60-year-old woman had died after being hit by a fallen tree in Aberdeen. Scotland has seen winds of more than 100mph.

It comes as parts of the country reel from the impact of Storm Malik, with more than 130,000 homes and businesses suffering power cuts and widespread travel disruption.

And there are warnings another storm is set to batter the UK with strong winds, snow and heavy rain within hours.

Widespread power outages

Northern Powergrid said about 48,000 of its customers had their power restored as of 4pm - out of more than 78,000 affected since the problems began, mostly in the Northumberland and County Durham area.

It is currently responding to more than 600 concurrent reports of damage, which will require repair.

Many of those affected were also left without power following Storm Arwen late last year, with criticism then of the government's slow response.

Chorus of 'whoops' as power restored to town Becky Cotterill News correspondent @RLCotterill There was a small chorus of ‘whoops’ as the lights in the pub and several shops and houses came back on around 9pm. Rothbury in Northumberland had been without power all day, but the engineers working to undo Storm Malik’s damage were finally successful, at least for this town. A local mobile fish and chip shop - and its generator - provided a hot dinner for most residents before the electricity was restored. “We’re not normally out on a Saturday night so it’s what stock we’ve got left. But we’ve done our best to feed as many people as possible,” said Mary Wilkins, who owns Rothbury Food Truck. We met Lynne Farquha who lives nearby as she came to pick up dinner for her family, she was disappointed to find the fish had run out. “I have a little boy he needs to be kept warm and fed and watered and it’s really hard,” she said. Thankfully the return of the electricity will keep much of the town warm tonight. But they are still vulnerable as Storm Corrie approaches. This town knows only too well the devastating effect that a big storm can have. Arwen’s destruction in November is still fresh in their memory. “We were hit badly and there were properties that were without power for up to eleven days,” said local councillor Steven Bridgett.

Stewart Sexton, 58, in Alnwick, was left without power after the damage caused by Arwen - and has found himself fighting to heat his home again.

He told PA news agency: ""It's exactly like last time - no light, heat, hot water, no mobile signal in our village, which in itself is disgraceful.

""We can't do anything, it's awful here. Will we be left 10 days this time without heat, water, or mobile signal? I am standing on a hill to get this message to you.""

Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said 52,300 homes and businesses lost electricity, impacting those mainly in Aberdeenshire, Angus, Perthshire, and the Moray Coast.

An update at 11am said only 3,800 were reconnected due to ""significant damage"" to the network caused by wind-blown trees and debris.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the impact of Storm Malik as ""severe"" and said many SSEN customers may be left without power over the weekend.

In Greater Manchester, a woman had to be rescued by firefighters after a tree fell on to the roof of her car.

She received first aid from a fire service technician before being transferred to the care of the North West Ambulance Service.

Another tree crushed a van in Apperley Bridge, Bradford - just moments after the man inside had got out.

Storm Corrie due to bring even more dangerous winds

The extensive damage caused by Malik is due to be followed by Storm Corrie, which is expected to hit the UK on Sunday.

The move comes as the Foreign Office is expected to announce tougher sanctions on Monday, which will allow the UK to target Russia's strategic and financial interests.

Speaking of of the UK's plan to contribute more troops to NATO, Mr Johnson said: ""This package would send a clear message to the Kremlin - we will not tolerate their destabilising activity, and we will always stand with our NATO allies in the face Russian hostility.

""If President Putin chooses a path of bloodshed and destruction, it will be a tragedy for Europe. Ukraine must be free to choose its own future.

Moscow has denied it is planning to invade Ukraine, while at the same time amassing some 120,000 troops near the border of its Eastern European neighbour.

Russia has also expanded its military build-up to include supplies of blood that would allow it to treat casualties - another key indicator that Moscow is preparing an invasion, sources told Reuters news agency.

The UK already has more than 100 troops providing training in Ukraine, 900 military personnel based in Estonia, and a Light Cavalry Squadron of around 150 people is deployed to Poland.

Britain, the United States and other NATO allies appear increasingly concerned that hostilities are more likely than a negotiated solution to the crisis.

Labour has accused Mr Johnson of ""playing catch up with other world leaders"" on deterring Russian aggression against Ukraine.

Shadow defence secretary John Healey said the government is ""paralysed by a mess of its own making"" domestically as the PM awaits the highly anticipated partygate report from senior civil servant Sue Gray.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian reservists, some clutching mock wooden rifles, have taken part in military exercises on the outskirts of the country's capital Kyiv.

Ukraine has launched a new territorial defence force this year, which it wants to build up into a corps of up to 130,000 people.

Among the reservists are a lawyer, an IT programmer, and a freelancer in online advertising.

While they may stand little chance against the much bigger and better-equipped professional Russian army, reservists like them could be tasked with protecting civilian sites in Kyiv amid any conflict.

It come as Russia has said it will not conduct naval exercises in international waters in the Irish Sea next week following a request from the Irish government to relocate the manoeuvres.

Ireland was notified last week that the exercises would take place around 240km (149 miles) off the south west coast within its exclusive economic zone but not its territorial waters, meaning it was permitted under international law.

The powerful nor'easter, which are common for the region at this time of year, has flooded coastlines and blocked roads across 10 states, leaving treacherous conditions in its wake.

In New York, governor Kathy Hochul urged people to stay inside, warning of sub-zero wind chills after the storm passed through.

""This is a very serious storm, very serious. We've been preparing for this. This could be life-threatening,"" she said.

""It's high winds, heavy snow, blizzard conditions - all the elements of a classic nor'easter.""

Elsewhere, Boston was preparing for potentially record-breaking snowfall.

US meteorologist Anthony D Torres told Sky News: ""These nor'easters happen every year, but the powerful ones like this one happen maybe once or twice a decade. And this particular storm, if it produces more than 70cm of snowfall in Boston, would be the largest snowfall ever observed from a single storm in the Boston metropolitan area.""

Speaking to local media on Saturday, Boston City Councillor Ruthzee Louijeune said: ""This is going to be a historic blizzard.

""It's the power of the wind and the amount of snow that makes this one particularly dangerous.""

Residents in the city have been warned to stay indoors as the storm prepares to pass over.

Planes, trains, and automobiles all halted across the East Coast

Airlines had already cancelled more than 5,000 flights scheduled to depart between Friday and Saturday, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. More than 8,500 flights have been delayed.

More than 90% of Saturday schedules at Boston's Logan Airport and New York's LaGuardia were scrapped, according to FlightAware.

Amtrak trains on the busy corridor between Washington and Boston have all been halted, with delays or cancellations across much of the rest of the rail network.

Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee issued a state-wide ban on cars using the roads, as well as telling tractors and trailers to stay off the tarmac for now.

NBC correspondent Chris Pollone in Boston told Sky News that ""today is a day to stay home"".

""Of course, this area is used to heavy snowfall, but what's going to make it so dangerous is the heavy wind that's coming in blizzard-like conditions,"" he said.

""They say that people who are on the roads won't be able to see anything, and so they're saying it's really a day to stay in, allow the ploughs to do their work and clear the roads.""

The war games had angered Irish fishermen, who said up to 60 trawlers would continue to fish as normal in the area, peacefully disrupting the Russian manoeuvres.

But while Ireland did fire a broadside at Russia over the drills, it lacked the military muscle to do much else.

This evening, however, Russia's ambassador to Ireland said the exercises would be moved.

Yury Filatov said in a statement: ""In response to the requests from the Irish government as well as from the Irish South and West Fish Producer's Organisation, the Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation Sergey Shoigu has made a decision, as a gesture of goodwill, to relocate the exercises by the Russian Navy, planned for February 3-8, outside the Irish exclusive economic zone (EEZ), with the aim not to hinder fishing activities by the Irish vessels in the traditional fishing areas.""

Brendan Byrne of the Irish Fish Processors & Exporters Association told Sky News that he ""welcomed the sensible decision"", and said that it was ""a great boost for the fishing industry.""

Mr Byrne said that the Russians ""may have miscalculated"" in organising exercises in a lucrative fishing ground, and that ""the Irish fishing industry wasn't going to back down."" He said his organisation is now calling for a 10-year moratorium on naval exercises by any country within Ireland's EEZ, for ecological and fishing reasons.

Ireland's minister for foreign affairs Simon Coveney tweeted: ""This week I wrote to my counterpart, the Minister of Defence of Russia, to request a reconsideration of naval exercises off the Irish coast.

""This evening I received a letter confirming the Russian exercises will be relocated outside of Ireland's EEZ. I welcome this response.""

The planned naval exercises, against the backdrop of the Ukraine crisis and with the strident response of Irish fishermen, had captured international media attention.

They were David taking on Goliath - amateur investors going up against the might of the financial system.

A year on from the GameStop phenomenon and interest in the ""meme stock"" has not died down.

""I call it 'the events' because so much happened in that month,"" says Jonah Tulis, producer and director of GameStop: Rise of the Players.

The documentary, which was released in US cinemas this week, follows GameStop investors as their actions explode into an international news story.

""That was a moment. It was the beginning of a new era,"" the 31-year-old says.

The saga began in January 2021 when the struggling video game retailer saw an unprecedented rise in its share price.

Amateur, or retail investors, communicated on social media, particularly Reddit, and created a surge in interest in the company.

They thought the market was undervaluing the ""bricks-and-mortar"" computer game store, and rallied around it, forcing the price of the stock upwards with their purchases.

""It was wild… they acted on instinct. It was impossible at the time to gauge what retail investors could do,"" says Tulis.

These investors had also realised that large hedge funds were ""short-selling"" GameStop - they were betting against the value rising.

So, when the opposite happened, and the value went up, they were dealt a heavy blow, losing billions of dollars - and the ""war on Wall Street"" narrative was born.

By the middle of the month, shares in the company had soared over 500% since the beginning of the year, with many saying the online Reddit group r/wallstreetbets was responsible.

""Overall, our subjects made life-changing money - in the millions. And these were not rich people to begin with,"" adds Tulis, who also directed the film Console Wars.

'The end of the Wild West'

Image: The GameStop phenomenon became popular on social media website Reddit

Today, many on Reddit thread r/wallstreetbets are optimistic that this was not a one-off phenomenon.

The community of mostly well-informed amateur traders now boasts over 11.5 million followers.

There are ""definitely gonna be some major fireworks late Jan start Feb"", one comment reads.

""Only if you get the word out and make it a real event. Imagine the campaigning we can do to advertise the anniversary,"" says another.

Despite the continued hype, GameStop share prices have been falling since the start of this year.

Other ""meme stocks"" like cinema chain AMC Entertainment are also still spoken about, despite the share price almost returning to its pre-hype norm.

Some users seem pessimistic about the future.

""It's probably the end of the Wild West,"" writes one.

There are ""tough days ahead"", says another, in reference to higher interest rates on the horizon, which would dampen stock market gains.

""A few will make it big on meme stocks but most will lose a lifetime of savings,"" warns one.

These are thoughts echoed by some experts.

Investing for profit ""can be like a pyramid scheme in that the first ones in make a lot of money, the last ones in are the suckers and they get burnt,"" says Dr Jorge Guira, associate professor at the University of Reading.

He thinks pandemic lockdowns played a big part in the phenomenon.

""GameStop has done well relatively compared to how it was before, however it dropped 35% - more than the S&P; 500 which dropped 10% this year,"" he adds.

""This seems to reflect that people are now living more regular lives, rather than acting out the 'boredom market hypothesis' where people express themselves through these trades.""

On 28 January 2021, trading app RobinHood temporarily restricted the buying of some volatile stocks, including GameStop, in a move that sparked outrage.

Many felt it was unfair.

The company explained that it was forced to take action to make sure it could meet its requirements as a broker with the unprecedented volume of trade happening.

""We never want our customers to be surprised with trading restrictions again,"" it said in a statement this week.

RobinHood is continuing to make changes to its operations in response to the saga, doubling their customer support team and strengthening their compliance and risk infrastructure.

""The retail investing revolution has shown us that a new generation of investors wants their voices to be heard,"" it added.

""Our work has only just begun.""

Regulation reform may be coming

Image: Financial regulations may be reformed in the wake of the GameStop saga

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a government agency founded to prevent market manipulation, has proposed reforms as part of its investigation.

It may bring in tougher rules for hedge funds to improve the transparency of their activities.

""We can definitely expect the SEC to do something,"" says James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University's McDonough business school.

""Those who engage in short-selling say that more disclosure will make them public targets… and I think they have a point there, but at some point there does need to be the right amount of disclosure. Right now, we have too little.""

A new era in investing for ordinary people

On Reddit, the ""armchair investors"" doubt Wall Street is scared of them.

""The big dawgs rule the market,"" warned one, ""and most of the retail folks that play this game lose.""

Despite these sentiments, there remains a loyal community of excited investors backing GameStop.

Tulis believes this is the beginning of a trend which isn't going away.

""There is something special about how people are finding companies they believe in - companies they're connected to,"" he says.

""When I think of AMC or GameStop, there is an automatic sense of comfort.""

""Things have changed so much - you don't have to call a broker to buy a stock anymore.

""It's so much more accessible and that is going to allow a lot more people to invest with their hearts, whether it is for better or worse.""

The rucksack must be small.

Don't forget your important documents.

A first aid kit is essential.

As is a good knife.

It's a stark contrast to her Instagram, which is full of smiling photos of her with friends or enjoying holidays, like many young people her age.

Anastasiia's video has been viewed around 180,000 times and clocked up more than 400 comments.

Some thank her for the advice, others accuse her of stirring up fear.

For Anastasiia the situation is clear: ""To the people who comment saying I am spreading panic: Our country has been at war for eight years. This is basic information you need to know. Informed = armed.""

She is one of many Ukrainians who have gone online seeking and sharing practical advice as the spectre of a Russian invasion looms over them.

Data from Google Trends, which analyses the popularity of search queries, shows that searches for ""Russia Ukraine War"" in Ukrainian have increased dramatically over the past month.

The data also shows that people have been increasingly searching for information about the emergency survival bags Anastasiia talks about in her video.

Searches for ""bug-out bag"", a nickname for the emergency bag, have risen sharply over the last month.

As well as searching for information about bug-out bags, people are talking about them on social media.

Posts such as this simple illustration showing what to pack in a bug-out bag are common across Twitter.

And comments have appeared in various Facebook groups that were not designed to discuss the potential conflict.

One post in a prominent Facebook group for teachers provides a ""step-by-step guide"" on making bug-out bags for adults and children.

But Ukrainians are not just talking about packing a bag that can be tucked away in a corner and hopefully forgotten about.

Online posts talk of other practical measures. They urge people to make digital copies of their passports. They discuss first aid training. Others query whether it is worth buying a gun.

""Fill up your bathroom tub with water,"" one person writes on Reddit, an online forum.

Meanwhile, a mother on Facebook writes: ""Develop your family plan.""

""This sounds pretty strange right now, but thoughtful actions and planning will make things much easier,"" she adds.

She suggests setting up a meet-up location, having all family members carry fully charged power banks for mobile phones, knowing where all the local hospitals are and writing down phone numbers on paper.

""There may be no internet or electricity,"" she warns.

These discussions are not just among strangers online.

Ukrainian news channels have been airing dedicated segments on how to prepare a bug-out bag, with one recent segment amassing more than 60,000 views online.

The presenter begins the piece, saying: ""Almost on a daily basis everyone is saying that the Kremlin is proactively preparing for a full-scale incursion into our state. How can one stay calm in this?""

It goes on to give tips about making copies of documents, having plenty of cash and being prepared to go analogue.

""You should be prepared [deal with] problems with internet,"" the reporter says. ""Experts recommend to have a printed map with you... rather than to rely on a GPS navigator. Maps and documents are better to be wrapped up in a plastic bag so that they won't get wet by accident.""

The government has also been sharing information online to help people prepare.

This map issued by the government shows where bomb shelters are located across the city, although some have claimed the information is not up-to-date.

Online searches for these bomb shelters have increased in much the same way as for bug-out bags.

In Kyiv, searches for ""bomb shelter"" in Ukrainian have almost reached the levels seen almost eight years ago with the annexation of Crimea.

Questions over whether the whole country could be drawn into war have been on Ukrainian minds since Russia began moving troops closer to their shared border last year.

But for many, the spectre of invasion isn't new - with fighting in eastern Ukraine continuing to this day.

This is reflected online with some joking that their preparation involves drinking red wine and trying not to be nervous.

While others plainly tell commenters to calm down.

Wolverhampton and Sheffield will be the first of 20 areas picked to benefit from a ""radical new regeneration programme"" launched by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC).

The chosen locations will be prioritised for a £1.5bn Brownfield Fund made available from April 2022.

The cash to fund the work was allocated by the Treasury last year as part of a £1.8bn sum for brownfield regeneration promised by the chancellor at the last budget.

Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said: ""We are on a mission to regenerate the nation, transforming derelict areas in our towns and cities into thriving places people are proud to live and work in.

""We are refocusing Homes England and empowering local leaders to support levelling up, delivering Kings Cross style transformational regeneration projects across the country - starting in Wolverhampton and Sheffield.

""This huge investment in infrastructure and regeneration will spread opportunity more evenly and help to reverse the geographical inequalities which still exist in the UK.""

But Lisa Nandy, Labour's shadow levelling up secretary, accused the government of handing out ""rehashed pots of money and policies"".

She said: ""The limit of this government's ambition for Britain can't surely be this? Rehashed pots of money and policies for just 20 places. High streets will only thrive when people have money in their pockets to spend.

""We need good jobs, decent wages, genuinely affordable housing and action to deal with the unfolding cost of living crisis so people can spend in their local economy and young people no longer have to get out to get on. Instead, they've handed a few local areas a fiver and nicked a tenner.""

He also called on North Korea to stop creating tensions and to return to talks.

North Korea has conducted several missile launches since then, varying in weapon types, launch locations and showing increasing sophistication.

It has launched hypersonic and long-range cruise missiles, as well as missiles launched from railcars and airports.

Possible future tests

While North Korea has not tested its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons since 2017, its leaders earlier this month suggested they could restart such tests.

Forecasters say another deep low-pressure system, named Storm Corrie, will bring further unsettled weather - especially to Scotland - later today and into tomorrow.

Corrie will bring winds of up to 90mph in some exposed coastal locations and mountainous areas of Scotland.

Around 34,000 customers are still without power across the north of England and Scotland, power companies have said.

Yesterday, a nine-year-old boy in Staffordshire and a 60-year-old women in Aberdeen were killed by falling trees.

On Saturday, a group of kayakers also had to be rescued after becoming stranded on an island river amid strong winds and waves. Kent Police and a marine unit got as close as possible before officers swam ashore, negotiating100m of thick mud to help those stuck.

Now, amber and yellow severe weather warnings for wind are in force, which state ""flying debris is likely"" with possible damage to trees and buildings.

The Met Office warning said: ""Injuries and danger to life is likely from large waves and beach material being thrown onto coastal roads, sea fronts and properties.""

Chief Meteorologist, Dan Suri, said: ""Storm Corrie will bring very strong winds to the north of the UK, especially northern Scotland, on Sunday. This follows just one day after Storm Malik moves through, also bringing a spell of very strong winds.

""Storm Corrie will bring gusts of up to 90mph in exposed coastal locations in northern Scotland, with 70-80mph gusts more widely in the north.""

The Met Office has also said that most of Scotland north of Perth will see wintry showers and falling temperatures that will allow ice to form, increasing the likelihood of accidents.

'Hunker down for next 24-hours'

Robert Colburn, emergency response manager for Red Cross Scotland, said he and his team are ""ready and on standby"" if required.

""All of these things, anything that is weather, you can do your preparation but you just have to sit and wait and see what happens when it actually hits,"" he said.

""There are lots of things that people can do preparing - this afternoon, for example, prepare to stay at home. If you don't have to go out, certainly don't go out. Have your mobile phone charged. Have available battery-powered radio and torches, just in case you get a power outage. Have easy to prepare snacks in the house, bottles of water.""

A nine-year-old boy died after a tree fell on him and a man in Winnothdale, Staffordshire, at around 1pm on Saturday.

Both were taken to Royal Stoke University Hospital, where the boy passed away and the man remains for treatment.

Separately, a woman died after being hit by a fallen tree in Aberdeen.

Sky Sports reporter Keith Downie shared images of damage after his three-month-old car was crushed by a falling ""100ft"" tree which ""broke off during the storm... fell down onto the side of the house, bounced off the side wall and careered through both of the cars"".

He told Sky News: ""It's a scene of utter devastation, I have to say. I was pretty badly shaken all day yesterday knowing how close that I was to it when it came down.

""And I suppose aided by the fact that I'm working tomorrow and it's transfer deadline day for Sky Sports News and I cover Newcastle United and I'm expecting it to be a pretty busy day as far as potential transfer business is concerned.""

Senior Tory backbencher Robert Halfon told Sky News the government should instead look at windfall taxes on big businesses, or raising capital gains tax, in order to boost health spending after the COVID pandemic.

He is one of a number of Conservatives to call for Mr Johnson and Rishi Sunak to abandon their plans for a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance contributions from next April.

That pressure led to reports suggesting the PM was ""wobbling"" on whether to go ahead, but he and his chancellor have this weekend used a Sunday Times article to double down on the tax hike.

Image: The PM and chancellor recommitted to the tax rise in a joint Sunday Times article

Speaking to Sky News' Trevor Phillips On Sunday, Mr Halfon said he was in agreement with ministers that extra cash was needed to help the NHS deal with backlogs caused by the COVID crisis, and to fund social care reforms.

""There is an umbilical cord between the British people and the NHS, and they want that money spent,"" said the former minister, who now chairs the House of Commons' education committee.

""I also agree that we shouldn't borrow to pay for this because all that does is defer tax rises and also puts pressure on interest rates. What I'm just asking the government to do is to go back to the drawing board and look at how they raise that money.

""I've suggested that the government looks at windfall taxes on big businesses, particularly oil companies, for example, who have been raking it in over the past couple of years. Perhaps increase capital gains tax as well, so we can raise those funds for the NHS without hitting low-income workers.""

Johnson and Sunak defend 'progressive' policy

MPs approved the £12bn a year tax hike last year, but there are growing concerns over the impact of the increase on British households amid surging inflation and looming rises in energy bills.

The pressure on the PM to scrap the rise has also grown amid open speculation among Tories about Mr Johnson's future in Downing Street over the partygate scandal.

But in their Sunday Times article, Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak stated there is ""no magic money tree"".

In a pointed show of unity, the pair wrote: ""We must go ahead with the health and care levy. It is progressive: the burden falls most on those who can most afford it.

""Every penny of that £39bn will go on crucial objectives - including nine million more checks, scans and operations, and 50,000 more nurses, as well as boosting social care.""

""We are tax-cutting Conservatives. We believe people are the best judges of how to spend their money.""

Questions over 'Thatcherite' credentials

Lord Frost, the prime minister's former Brexit minister who quit the government last month over his concerns about tax rises and COVID restrictions, challenged Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak's assertion in the newspaper article that they are ""tax-cutting Conservatives"".

Lord Frost highlighted analysis that shows the UK's tax burden is on course to reach its highest level since the early 1950s.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was on Sunday quizzed about a contrast between Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak's pledge that they are ""Thatcherites"" and the projected rise in the tax burden to levels last seen in the UK's post-war recovery.

She told Sky News the government had taken ""difficult decisions"" due to the ""extraordinary circumstances"" of the COVID pandemic, but added: ""We are committed to cutting taxes, we are committed to driving up growth, we are committed to using our new regulatory freedoms [after Brexit].""

Labour frontbencher Lisa Nandy accused the government of having ""really missed the point"" with its ""levelling up"" agenda.

""They have got to get money back into people's pockets,"" the shadow levelling up, housing and communities secretary told Sky News.

""Right across this country, town centres are not thriving, high streets are falling apart.

""Because not only have we seen good wages, good jobs depart from many parts of the country over recent decades, it's been turbocharged in the last 10 years.

Yes, it's possible to score a knockout in one fell swoop. But to do that, you've got to land a big punch in the right place.

Moreover, if you miss, you'd better get on the attack again sharpish before your opponent has chance to catch their breath.

What we've seen over the last week is a battered Boris Johnson picking himself up off the mat as his adversaries stare at their gloves and wonder whether their fists were quite as furious as they had first thought.

Big domestic and international issues have helped the prime minister.

This week will see him - take a deep breath:

• Mark the anniversary of Brexit by bringing forward deregulation plans

• Speak to Vladimir Putin to try and avoid war on Europe's doorstep

• Fly out to the fringes of Russia to show solidarity with Ukraine

• Flesh out a key part of his legislative agenda by revealing how he plans to ""level up""

• Potentially unveil cost of living support ahead of huge rises in energy prices.

These are all serious topics in their own right. But, be under no illusion, they play a part in the prime minister's political recovery as well.

Rebel Conservative MPs may find it harder to agitate for a confidence vote in Mr Johnson if, at the same time, he's inspecting troops in the snowy wilds of eastern Europe.

It may all look especially awkward for members of the 2019 ""Red Wall"" intake if they are attempting to remove a prime minister on the same day he's announcing investment in their patches.

The confirmation that the controversial rise in national insurance is going ahead also gives us an indication that Mr Johnson's political stock may be in the ascendancy.

Shelving the manifesto-busting hike would have placated many of the backbenchers that have been gunning for him.

The fact he has now explicitly committed to it tells us the man in Number 10 believes he still has the political authority to push through something that's hated by many in his party.

But perhaps the two biggest catalysts of this recent reprieve came from developments that at first looked damaging.

Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker

The defection of Bury South MP Christian Wakeford to Labour sapped urgency and venom out of the plot to remove the prime minister.

More crucially, the launch of a police inquiry into ""partygate"" allegations - and the resulting delay in the publication of the Sue Gray report - stunted the building political crescendo and gave Mr Johnson time to dust himself off.

The Metropolitan Police's request for ""minimal reference"" to some Downing Street events also lessened the likelihood of a knockout blow arriving in the form of an unredacted report full of gory details around who knew what about government gatherings.

What could the Gray inquiry mean for Boris Johnson?

What's the difference between the police inquiry and Sue Gray's?

However, this isn't to say the prime minister will be able to return to full strength.

Many Conservative MPs agree the partygate scandal has permanently hobbled Mr Johnson and inflicted numerous chinks in his political armour.

This at a time when he's facing huge pressure over rising prices and the cost of living, as well as ballooning NHS waiting lists.

The local elections in May are another point of danger and the first post-partygate test of whether the prime minister is still an electoral asset.

Then there's the chance of a sucker punch arriving in the coming days.

Even with redactions, the Gray report may still be critical enough of Mr Johnson to trigger a rush to remove him.

That may be compounded by leaks of damaging information or other interventions intended to take down the government.

It could all be exaggerated if there's suspicion of a cover-up, with the most serious allegations removed from the Gray inquiry outcome.

There is no doubting the gravity of the crisis and the need for all NATO allies to be ready to bolster their defences and ability to deter Russian aggression.

But the Kremlin will know that Mr Johnson's strong language - saying on Sunday that he has ""ordered our Armed Forces to prepare to deploy across Europe next week"" - rings pretty hollow when looking at the size of Britain's army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, the quantity of modernised warships, tanks and jets and the size of ammunition stockpiles.

Of course, the UK is part of the 30-member NATO alliance, which includes the far larger and more powerful United States.

But it is worth considering - when the British prime minister chooses unilaterally to make a political statement about what the UK can do to help deter Russia - how decades of hollowing out Britain's defences by successive governments, botched equipment procurement programmes and significant cuts mean that the ability for the UK to project power for a sustained period - while still significant - is limited.

The numbers spell this out pretty starkly.

The full-time trained strength of the Armed Forces in April 2010 was around 177,800 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Royal Marines.

The number now stands at around 137,100 - a drop of some 40,000 personnel - and falling, though there has been a greater emphasis on building up reserve forces.

Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, and his military chiefs stress that military power is no longer simply about mass given advances in technology, including cyber and artificial intelligence.

They are right in the sense that a modern soldier, fitted with state-of-the art communications equipment and weapons, is far more lethal than his or her counterpart from even just a decade ago.

The 80-year-old had said repeatedly that he did not want a second mandate, but was urged to change his mind after members of parliament and regional delegates failed to agree on other candidates after days of voting.

He was added to the eighth round of balloting and won with 759 votes, passing the threshold of 505 needed.

There are 1,009 ""Grand Electors"" who can participate.

Mattarella's 'sense of responsibility'

In a televised statement from the Quirinal presidential palace, Mr Mattarella told the nation he could not let his personal plans prevail over a ""sense of responsibility"" during the ""grave health, economic and social emergency"" caused by the pandemic.

He said he was committed ""to interpret the expectations and hopes of our fellow citizens"".

In the Italian political system, presidents appoint prime ministers and are often called on to resolve political crises.

Mr Mattarella's first term ends on Thursday.

'Splendid news for Italians'

Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who leads a coalition government, was among those who wanted him to stay on and telephoned party leaders to encourage them to change his mind, according to Rai state TV.

Draghi said in a statement that Mr Mattarella's re-election was ""splendid news for Italians"", and thanked him for ""his decision to go along with the extremely strong will of parliament"".

He had previously indicated he would be willing to step into the role of president, but some party leaders worried this would prompt an early election and more political instability for Italy.

""You don't change a winning team,'' ex-premier Matteo Renzi told reporters ahead of the penultimate vote.

Former PM Silvio Berlusconi, who leads the centre-right Forza Italia party and dropped his own bid to be president a week ago, said that unity ""today can only be found around"" the figure of Mr Mattarella.

Giuseppe Conte, another former prime minister, hailed him as ""the guarantor of everybody: impartial, authoritative"".

'Bartering away the presidency'

On the right, while the League and Forza Italia parties eventually embraced Mr Mattarella's extended tenure, the Brothers of Italy, which has not joined them in government, denounced the lobbying behind the scenes.

Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni accused her allies of ""bartering away"" the presidency to make sure the government stays in place until the legislature ends in 2023.

Relations among the governing parties have deteriorated during the election process amid disagreements about who should become president.

Mr Draghi's coalition includes the main centre-left and centre-right parties, as well as the right-wing League, the once anti-establishment 5-Star movement, and a number of smaller parties.

""And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons because they are being treated so unfairly.""

One police officer who responded to the scene died the day after the attack, while four others who guarded the Capitol later took their own lives.

Mr Trump was accused of sparking the disorder by claiming the election was rigged, and at a rally on the day of the mayhem told them to ""fight like hell"".

Although he eventually told the mob to ""go home"" he added: ""We love you, you're very special.""

Before leaving office, Mr Trump pardoned numerous political allies, friends, and associations, including his former chief strategist Steve Bannon.

He has been vocal in his criticism of the Democrat-led house for its ongoing investigation into the riot.

More than 700 people have been arrested and charged with federal crimes in connection with the riots - the largest investigation in the Justice Department's history.

Of these, 150 people have been charged with assaulting police officers, and more than 50 charged with conspiracy.

A statue of Canadian hero Terry Fox - who lost a leg to bone cancer and then trekked across the country in 1980 - was draped in an upside-down Canadian flag calling to ""mandate freedom"".

The move caused widespread condemnation, including from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Mr Trudeau retweeted a statement from the Terry Fox Foundation that said: ""Terry believe in science and gave his life to help others"".

Canada's Defence Staff Chief General Wayne Eyre said those involved in the demonstration ""should hang their heads in shame"", tweeting: ""I am sickened to see protesters dance on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and desecrate the National War Memorial.

Canada has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world and the premier of the province of Quebec who is proposing to tax the unvaccinated is popular.

Police had been prepared for the possibility of violence and warned residents to avoid downtown. A parliament security official advised politicians to lock their doors, amid reports their private homes may be targeted.

However, the Canadian Trucking Alliance said a great number of the protesters who gathered in Ottawa had no connection to the trucking industry, and said they had a separate agenda to push.

The alliance said the vast majority of drivers are vaccinated.

Some opposition Canadian Conservative politicians served coffee to protestors, while former US President Donald Trump weighed in, telling a rally in Texas: ""We want those great Canadian truckers to know that we are with them all the way. They are doing more to defend American freedom than our leaders by far.""

However, former US Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman, who served under President Barack Obama, said ""the threat against democracy is not only happening in America"".

It's the lowest number of cases reported since 14 December, when there were 59,610.

The figures compare with the 72,727 infections and 296 deaths that were confirmed yesterday, and 78,317 and 75 reported this time last week.

The latest government data doesn't include the deaths and cases figures for Northern Ireland because they weren't provided in time.

The latest UK vaccination figures show a further 52,295 people have had their third jab - bringing the total to 37,263,317.

Another 37,477 have had a second dose, bringing the total to 48,385,074, while a further 17,652 people have had their first jab - bringing the total to 52,331,601.

The latest figures come as vulnerable children aged between five and 11 are now eligible for their first jab.

Some 500,000 children who are either most at risk of coronavirus or live with someone vulnerable are now able to get their jabs.

Joseph Aquilina, 45, a neurodiversity consultant from Thames Ditton, celebrated the ""lucky"" opportunity for his son Xavier, 11.

Xavier, who has benign rolandic epilepsy, said: ""It is exciting to be able to be less vulnerable.""

2008;2008;Chicago: Man who spent 20 years in jail released after twin confesses to murder;Sunday 30 January 2022 16:11, UK;[];['chicago'];['murder', 'confesses', 'trial', '20', 'kevin', 'twin', 'mr', 'man', 'chicago', 'case', 'dugar', 'court', 'county', 'jail', 'spent', 'smith', 'released', 'drop'];"An American man who spent nearly two decades in jail for a 2003 murder has been released years after his identical twin confessed to the crime.

Kevin Dugar was convicted in 2005 over a deadly gang-related shooting and was sentenced to 54 years in prison.

A gunman had opened fire on three people in Chicago's Uptown area, killing Antwan Carter and wounding Ronnie Bolden, according to NBC Chicago.

Mr Dugar has long maintained his innocence, refusing a plea deal that would have reduced his jail term to 11 years.

Twin writes confessional letter

His fate appeared to be sealed until his twin brother, Karl Smith, wrote him a letter in 2013 admitting he had carried out the murder.

The siblings had dressed alike until the eighth grade and had impersonated each other for years, The Chicago Tribune reported.

Their last names are different because Smith took his mother's maiden name.

Initially, the admission had little impact on Mr Dugar's case, with a judge ruling in 2018 that Smith's confession was not credible, according to The Chicago Tribune.

Prosecutors said Smith had nothing to lose by speaking up for his brother because he was already serving out a 99-year prison sentence for a home invasion that saw a child shot in the head, which he could not appeal.

A lawyer with the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law's Center on Wrongful Convictions took Mr Dugar's case back to court, however, and the Illinois Court of Appeals overturned that decision in 2021 - a move that eventually led to his release.

Image: Karl Smith admitted to the murder in a letter to his twin brother Kevin Dugar

Mr Dugar could face trial again if charges not dropped

Cook County authorities must now decide whether to put him on trial again or drop the charges.

His lawyer Ronald Safer told NBC News he hoped the case would not have to go to court again, describing it as a ""stranger than fiction"" tale that was ""made for TV"".

""We are hopeful that the [Cook County] state's attorney will drop the case against Kevin and then do what they will, but drop the case against Kevin because he's innocent,"" he said.

""It's clear that he's innocent, but if they persist, we will go to trial, and we will vindicate him at trial.""

The Cook County state's attorney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

'Relishing his freedom'

Mr Dugar broke down into tears as he was reunited with his loved ones, Mr Safer said.

""You know, you would think it's just unmitigated joy, but the adjustment, the wounds that are inflicted by wrongful incarceration, are deep and enduring and there is an adjustment period that lasts a lifetime, but particularly in the early days are very, very challenging,"" he said.

""So, [he is] relishing his freedom, but it is a difficult adjustment,"" he said.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220130170444/https://news.sky.com/story/chicago-man-who-spent-20-years-in-jail-released-after-twin-confesses-to-murder-12528722;

Climate change, particularly a warmer ocean, likely impacted the strength of the storm, scientists have said.

But his message is far more problematic.

Mr Kennedy is one of America's leading anti-vaccine activists, and his popularity is soaring.

As the Biden administration pleads with people to get vaccinated against COVID, particularly in states where less than half the population is double-jabbed, Mr Kennedy is spearheading the resistance.

The US has been hard hit by the Omicron variant and there are around 145,000 people hospitalised with COVID nationwide this week, slightly down from last week but still higher than any prior surge.

Experts believe one factor in why the US is still seeing record numbers of hospitalisations and deaths may be patchy vaccination rates.

Misinformation around vaccines is infecting certain populations, and it's spreading online.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:16 How do you make a misinformation vaccine?

Mr Kennedy claims CDC 'manipulates data' on COVID jabs

In a rare interview with mainstream media, Mr Kennedy told Sky News that the CDC, the official US health protection agency, is a ""sock puppet for Moderna and Pfizer"" which ""manipulates data"" on COVID vaccines.

Similar falsehoods can be found on the website for Mr Kennedy's non-profit, Children's Health Defense.

Visits to the website have skyrocketed, from 150,000 per month before the pandemic to a peak of 4.7 million in August, although Kennedy claims that figure is now closer to six million a month.

The website casts doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccine and amplifies rare instances of so-called ""vaccine injury"" while simultaneously claiming the CDC is manipulating real-world data which indicates the vaccine is safe.

Image: Sky's Martha Kelner speaking to Robert F Kennedy

Posts from Mr Kennedy's charity 'shared more often than news sources'

Research from Indiana University's Observatory on Social Media, which tracks vaccine-related content on Twitter, shows that posts from the Children's Health Defense website are now being shared more often on the platform than mainstream news sources.

Analysis of tweets using the word ""vaccine"" shows more shares to the Children's Health Defense website than any other site in the last week.

It has twice as many shares than the CDC, indicating the scale of the problem for those trying to combat misinformation around the COVID vaccine.

""Robert F Kennedy Jr is probably the most notorious and leading anti-vaxxer in the United States right now,"" Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, told Sky News.

""He's really rocketed up the league table because he's taken advantage of that Kennedy name to draw in people from both sides of the political aisle of the political spectrum.

""And what he's been able to do is soften the messaging, bring some sophistication to the messaging, which is just old-fashioned nonsense that vaccines harm you, or they cause other diseases.""

Image: Imran Ahmed said 'he's taken advantage of that Kennedy name to draw in people from both sides of the political aisle'

Growing donations to Mr Kennedy's charity

Donations to Children's Health Defense have increased exponentially, too.

Filings with charity regulators show revenue more than doubled in 2020, to $6.8m (£5m).

According to tax filings, Kennedy's was paid $255,000 (£212,000) by Children's Health Defense in 2019 and $345,561 (£257,775) in 2020, an increase of more than $90,000 (about £67,000).

Asked by Sky News if he was profiting from a public health crisis, Mr Kennedy said: ""If you're worried about somebody profiting from a public health crisis, you should be getting Pfizer or you should be investigating Moderna and the Silicon Valley billionaires.

""I've given all of my book profits to the charity, so this has cost me, it is the opposite of profits for me personally.

""I've given almost a million dollars in profits to the charity, so I have a dramatic net loss.""

Mr Kennedy says he is 'saving lives'

When asked if he was putting lives at risk by amplifying misinformation around the COVID vaccine, Mr Kennedy bristled and said: ""I know we are saving people's lives, and we're saving democracy because children should not be getting this vaccine.""

He also said he did not believe that in some hospital COVID wards, up to 99% of patients were unvaccinated.

At a rally in Washington DC this month opposing vaccine mandates, Mr Kennedy Jr compared COVID-19 vaccine requirements in the US to conditions in Nazi Germany and said people living under Nazi rule ""could hide in an attic, like Anne Frank did"".

He later apologised for his comments and his wife, the actress Cheryl Hines, condemned the comparison.

While cases are low compared to other countries, China has a ""zero-tolerance"" policy when it comes to fighting the virus, which includes trying to stop chains of transmission as soon as they are discovered.

Residents are also being asked to test in the run-up to the Games at one of the 19 spots around Beijing, according to state media, adding that just 12 cases have been recorded in the latest 24-hour reporting period.

Sky Sports News reports that Eriksen is close to joining the west London club, just seven months after suffering a cardiac arrest in a game against Finland.

Eriksen left Inter Milan last month by mutual consent, after being suspended by the Italian medical authority from playing in Serie A due to a rule prohibiting the use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) device.

Chief executive Daniel Ek also said the streaming giant will publish its ""long-standing platform rules"", to be more transparent about ""the policies that guide our content more broadly"".

Young and Mitchell removed their music from Spotify because it hosts The Joe Rogan Experience (TJRE) podcast, which has discouraged young people from getting vaccinated against coronavirus and shared a number of false claims about the jab.

The rules tell contributors not to promote dangerous, deceptive, sensitive or illegal content on its platform.

The guidance adds that ""breaking the rules may result in the violative content being removed from Spotify"".

Ukraine has a military force of around 250,000 personnel.

Reservists have been taking part in military exercises on the outskirts of the country's capital, Kyiv.

Britain has had a 100-strong training mission in the country that has trained around 22,000 Ukrainian military personnel since 2015.

NATO

The NATO Response Force is a 40,000-strong force ready to mobilise in the event of a crisis.

This includes a 5,000-strong ""spearhead"" very high-readiness army brigade, as well as 15,000 military personnel to operate warplanes, warships, and special operational forces across the alliance.

NATO also has another 20,000 military personnel ready to ""follow-up"" if a crisis lasts beyond a few days or weeks.

As well as the emergency troops, there are four battle groups of around 1,000 soldiers each, based in Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and Lithuania.

Sky News understands that NATO allies have been considering the possibility of setting up new 1,000-strong battle groups based in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Slovakia.

NATO also oversees five Air Policing missions, which involves a 24/7 presence of fighter aircraft poised to react with short notice to airspace violations.

Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, they strengthened air-policing in the Baltic States and Poland, with allies also sending fighters to help the Bulgarian and Romanian air forces.

United Kingdom

Britain has 900 troops in Estonia, heading up the NATO battle group of around 1,000 military personnel in the country.

Danish, French, and Estonian forces make up the rest of this battle group, part of the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence set up in 2016.

More than 100 British troops are providing training in Ukraine, and a Light Cavalry Squadron of around 150 servicemen and women are deployed to Poland as part of a US-led battle group.

The Royal Navy's HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carrier took command of the maritime arm of NATO's high-readiness force at the start of the year.

Hundreds gathered around the modest Bloody Sunday monument in the Bogside, among them Ireland's prime minister, Taoiseach Micheal Martin.

Having laid their wreaths, families stood in silence, but when it came to the government's de-facto amnesty for veterans, they did not mince their words.

The prime minister is expected to travel to Eastern Europe in the coming days - as well as hold a call with Vladimir Putin - amid growing tensions between Moscow and the West over Russia's build-up of troops on Ukraine's border.

At the same time, Mr Johnson is still awaiting a senior civil servant's report into multiple claims of COVID breaches in Downing Street during lockdown restrictions.

The publication of Sue Gray's report has been delayed by the launching of a Metropolitan Police investigation into a number of the partygate allegations.

This has piled the pressure on the prime minister over a scandal that has seen Conservative MPs openly question Mr Johnson's future in Number 10.

Johnson 'sitting on a time bomb'

Lord Dannatt, the former chief of the general staff, claimed the ongoing partygate inquiries were a ""time bomb"" sitting under Mr Johnson.

""I think Boris Johnson is in a very precarious position,"" he told Times Radio. He said that ""at a time of an international crisis"", the UK's ""flawed"" leadership meant that the West was ""weakened"" in its response.

Asked if the partygate row was undermining the UK's response to the Ukraine situation, he said: ""Of course it is. We are weakened.

""He [Mr Johnson] will travel to Moscow, or wherever he's going in Eastern Europe, this week, but everyone will know that he's a man with a time bomb sitting under him.""

The retired army officer added: ""We've got to sort out the leadership of this country. We've got to get that sorted out. Either get behind Boris Johnson or get rid of him and let Rishi [Sunak] or someone take over.""

The prime minister's political opponents at Westminster have also claimed Mr Johnson is unable to deal with major issues - including soaring energy bills - due to the lingering partygate scandal.

But, speaking to Sky News' Trevor Phillips On Sunday show, Ms Truss dismissed the suggestion that the government was ""paralysed"" by the partygate row.

""I don't recognise your characterisation of the situation,"" the foreign secretary said, citing her recent visits to Brussels and Northern Ireland and upcoming trip to Ukraine.

""We are working to supply more troops to the borders of the Baltics, we are working to up our sanctions package, we are 100% focused on our day job.""

She also referenced Michael Gove's forthcoming ""levelling up"" paper, and the ongoing booster jab rollout.

Labour: UK 'being held back' by PM

Speaking on the same programme, Labour frontbencher Lisa Nandy rejected a suggestion the opposition had missed an opportunity to force Mr Johnson out of Number 10.

""All of this is up to the public, in the end the prime minister, if he stays, will have to face the public in a general election,"" she said.

""The president has been briefed on the details of the incident,"" a statement by Mr Herzog's office said. ""There was no danger posed nor is there danger posed to the president and his delegation.""

The Emirati defence ministry said the missile was intercepted and destroyed on Monday morning, adding that its debris fell on an uninhabited area. It did not say where the missile was targeting and it was the third-such attack in recent weeks.

Houthi military spokesman Yehia Sarei tweeted that the rebels would make an announcement about an attack in the coming hours that reached into ""the depths of the UAE"".

The missile fire further escalates tensions across the Persian Gulf, which previously had seen a series of assaults near - but never indisputably on - Emirati soil, as Yemen's war continues to rage.

Deepening ties between the two nations

President Herzog arrived in the UAE on Sunday in the first official visit by the country's head of state.

The visit is the latest sign of deepening ties between the two nations as tensions rise in the region, with mutual hostility towards Iran and fears over its nuclear programme pushing them closer together.

On Sunday, Mr Herzog discussed security and bilateral relations with Abu Dhabi's powerful Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the de facto Emirati leader.

During two hours of talks, Mr Herzog urged more countries in the region to join in recognising Israel and condemned the recent aerial attacks on Abu Dhabi claimed by Houthi rebels.

'A common view'

""I wish to emphasise that we completely support your security requirements and we condemn in all forms and language any attack on your sovereignty,"" Mr Herzog told Sheikh Mohammed, according to his office.

Sheikh Mohammed said the two countries share a ""common view of the threats to regional stability and peace, particularly those posed by militias and terrorist forces"".

Media coverage has been tightly controlled, with journalists invited neither by the Israeli leader nor by Emirati authorities, and no accompanying news conferences.

'Denial of rights'

The UAE and Israel normalised relations in the 2020 in a series of US-brokered diplomatic deals between Israel and Arab states, which had long-avoided formal relations with Israel over its decades-old conflict with the Palestinians.

Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas, which opposes countries normalising relations with Israel, said such visits ""encourage the occupation to continue escalating its aggression against our Palestinian people and denial of their rights"".

Although the UAE has largely withdrawn its own forces from Yemen, it is still actively engaged in the conflict. It supports militias fighting the Houthis, who seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in September 2014.

The missile attacks targeting the UAE come as the Houthis face pressure and are suffering heavy losses on the battlefield.

Yemeni government forces, allied and backed by the UAE, have pushed back the rebels in key provinces.

Authorities enraged pet lovers with an order to kill more than 2,200 hamsters after tracing an outbreak to a store where an employee tested positive for the Delta variant on Monday 17 January.

Eleven hamsters at the store, named Little Boss, also tested positive.

At least several of them had been imported from the Netherlands, where the outbreak at the store is believed to have originated.

Dozens of pet shops that sold hamsters can now reopen after being ordered to close.

However, importing the rodents remains banned.

Thousands of hamsters were culled after people who bought one of the rodents on or after 22 December were ordered to surrender them for testing and what the government described as ""humane dispatch"".

The customers were also told they would be subject to mandatory testing and were urged not to go into the community until their tests had returned negative.

The city's agriculture, fisheries and conservation department said it has tested 1,134 samples from animals other than hamsters, such as rabbits and chinchillas, and none of them had COVID-19.

Five shops still closed

Five stores, including Little Boss, have remained closed because they had not yet ""passed the virus test"", the government said.

""All the other concerned pet shops on the other hand have been thoroughly disinfected and cleaned and the environmental swabs collected from these shops have all passed the COVID-19 virus test,"" officials said.

The government said on Friday it would compensate pet shops trading in hamsters, offering a one-off payment of up to HK$30,000 (US$3,850).

Researchers in Hong Kong have said they found evidence pet hamsters can spread COVID-19, linking them to human infections in the city as part of a study published in The Lancet medical journal, which has not yet been peer reviewed.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned that another storm due to hit the region on Sunday may be ""more severe for parts of Scotland"" than anticipated.

Excessively strong winds and heavy rain caused the temporary closure of several bridges in Denmark on Saturday, including the key Oresund road and rail bridge connecting Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malmo.

Health workers in England were meant to be fully vaccinated by April but Health Secretary Sajid Javid has been under growing pressure to scrap the rule.

There have been concerns that the sector could be left with a massive staffing crisis due to the number of workers refusing to be vaccinated.

The Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Javid will meet ministers on the COVID-operations cabinet committee today where he is expected to confirm the U-turn.

The government is ending the policy because Omicron is milder than previous variants of the virus, the newspaper said.

But it comes just a week after the Department Of Health And Social Care said there were no plans to change the policy, despite reports suggesting ministers were considering a delay in its implementation.

On the second anniversary of the UK's official departure from the EU, the prime minister is pledging to ""further unleash the benefits of Brexit"" with a promise to cut £1bn worth of red tape for British businesses.

The plans will be viewed at Westminster as part of a so-called ""Operation Red Meat"" by Mr Johnson to shore up support from Conservative MPs with a flurry of attractive-looking policies for traditional Tory voters.

Image: Boris Johnson is vowing to 'further unleash the benefits of Brexit'

The Brexit Freedoms Bill, which Number 10 is promising to bring forward ""in due course"", is aimed at making it easier to amend or remove laws retained from the UK's 47-year membership of the EU.

Downing Street said, under current rules, reforming and repealing such laws would take several years due to the need for primary legislation for many changes, even if minor and technical.

The new bill is aimed at ensuring that changes can be made more easily and quickly, while Number 10 said the bill was also expected to end the ""special status"" of EU law - made before 1 January 2020 - in the UK's legal framework.

The plans will build on the work of former Brexit minister Lord Frost, who launched a drive to scrutinise thousands of remaining EU regulations and to identify those that could be improved or repealed.

Officials across government are currently continuing that review of retained Brussels laws, even though Lord Frost has since quit the government amid concern at the ""direction of travel"" of Mr Johnson's administration.

As well as unveiling the plans for the new bill, the government will today also publish a new document setting out how ministers are using new post-Brexit freedoms to benefit the UK's economy in areas such as artificial intelligence, data, transport, and the environment.

Mr Johnson said: ""Getting Brexit done two years ago today was a truly historic moment and the start of an exciting new chapter for our country.

""We have made huge strides since then to capitalise on our newfound freedoms and restore the UK's status as a sovereign, independent country that can determine its own future.

""The plans we have set out today will further unleash the benefits of Brexit and ensure that businesses can spend more of their money investing, innovating and creating jobs.""

Attorney General Suella Braverman said that setting up a mechanism to deal with retained EU law was ""essential"".

""It means we can move away from outdated EU laws that were the result of unsatisfactory compromises within the EU, some of which the UK voted and lobbied against - but was required to adopt without question,"" she added.

However, Scottish Culture Secretary Angus Robertson criticised the idea, which he said was devised with ""little discussion, consultation with, or indeed respect for, the Scottish parliament and government"".

He added: ""This makes a mockery of the UK government's recent commitment to reset relationships with the devolved governments.

Image: Labour questioned why the government isn't using a post-Brexit ability to cut VAT on energy bills

""Within days of the UK government promising more respectful ways of working, we were informed of what is clearly a rushed exercise over the weekend with nothing more than a vague verbal briefing.

""If these proposals involve changing the law in devolved policy areas, then pressing ahead without the consent of the Scottish parliament would demonstrate yet again the UK government's intent to undermine devolution.""

Meanwhile, Labour highlighted one area where the government is so far refusing to take advantage of the post-Brexit ability to diverge from EU rules.

Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said: ""For all this talk from the government about the potential legislative freedom we have outside the EU, they still refuse to make a concrete change the Labour Party has been demanding in this area for months, which is the removal of VAT on people's energy bills.

""The British public overwhelmingly support Labour's proposed change, and it is time the government started listening.""

During the 2016 EU referendum campaign, Mr Johnson's Vote Leave campaign hailed a cut to VAT on energy bills as one of the potential benefits of Brexit.

Earlier this month, Conservative MPs voted against a Labour motion to cut VAT on household energy bills.

Chernobyl is close to the Ukrainian capital. And that makes it strategically important because north of the exclusion zone is the border with Russian ally Belarus.

Ukraine has been increasing military deployments to the zone, and we had come to find out why.

Svetlana was our guide. The radiation is in the ground, she said, sinking deeper every year. In places, it is far stronger than others, where chunks of reactor had fallen after the explosion 36 years ago.

Don't touch anything, especially the dogs, was the advice. Radiation can stay in their fur, apparently.

And she gave us a radiation counter, a small device like a USB thumb drive - it would let us know if we had been over exposed by the end of the day.

We drove through the snow, past deserted villages reclaimed by the forest. And on to Prypyat.

There is a sense of tranquillity but also disorientation at the knowledge this was once a thriving, bustling town of 50,000.

Chernobyl was one of the stars in the Soviet Empire's constellation of nuclear power stations, and its people were rewarded. Life here was good until the reactor went off.

Prypyat is stuck in a time when Russia called the shots. Faded hammers and sickles are everywhere. It is a time Russia's leader Vladimir Putin harks back to.

The order to empty Chernobyl's vast exclusion zone came from Moscow. There are now fears of fresh orders sending in Russian troops to claim it again on their way to Kyiv.

There is nothing for an invading army to take here, except for the shortest route to the Ukrainian capital.

If they chose to sweep south towards Kyiv, they would pass what was once the most dangerous place in the world.

You can now stand within 300 metres of the huge concrete and metal sarcophagus that's been built over the exploded reactor number four.

Our guide's radiation detector registered 1.0 - the recommended safety level is 0.3, but it was safe for a short while we were told.

The heightened Russian threat has prompted Ukraine to step up its deployment inside the exclusion zone, sending in 7,500 more border guards in the last two months.

""Chernobyl area is an area of increased danger,"" Lieutenant Colonel Yuri Shakraichuk of the Ukraine State Border Guard Service told Sky News. ""We increased the strength of protection, we increased the number of patrols, and we increased the number of people in these patrols.""

We joined border guards on patrol. They look like other soldiers, but among their kit are radiation dosimeters.

""If the device goes off,"" Lieutenant Colonel Shakraichuk told Sky News, ""the patrol will leave the contaminated territory as soon as possible. Also, all the routes that border patrols walk are monitored and patrols don't go to the places where the ionising radiation is high. To monitor the contaminated areas, we use drones.""

If the Russians do invade, the border patrol would hope to see them coming and order in reinforcements. If Russian forces can sweep through Chernobyl, the land to Kyiv is flat farmland and forest. Just a few hours tank drive to the Ukrainian capital.

To leave the exclusion zone requires sweeping for radiation. The underside of our vehicle was scanned by a device on a long pole. We were led into a hut and a contraption out of science fiction. We stood and waited in its metal confines before it declared us ""clear"".

Our radiation data neck pieces were submitted. No one had been overexposed.

Then on to the Stalkers Hotel, just outside the zone.

Stalkers are people who slip into the zone to stay a few nights. The appeal was giving authorities the slip, our guide told us, but it was also very dangerous for stalkers and the people they moved among afterwards.

Any particles of radiation they pick up are passed on to the outside world without detection.

Chernobyl is passing from being a sinister, forbidden world to a place attracting tourists, journalists, and stalkers.

Ukrainians hope that can continue once the pandemic and crisis with Russia can pass.

2031;2031;Is your job at risk? The roles most likely to be moved out of the UK due to remote working;Monday 31 January 2022 06:15, UK;[];['unemployment', 'technology'];['chocolate', 'job', 'office', 'sky', 'offshoring', 'pandemic', 'told', 'moved', 'remote', 'working', 'roles', 'likely', 'uk', 'jobs', 'risk'];"Remote working could cost swathes of Britons their jobs as firms look to move roles outside the UK, recruiters have warned.

With companies ""struggling to coax workers back into the office"", there is ""much less downside to offshoring"" than there was before the pandemic, according to Randstad, one of the world's largest recruiting companies.

The firm told Sky News growing wage demands are ""emboldening some global employers to move jobs to low-cost centres"".

Victoria Short, chief executive of Randstad UK, said salary increases that are well above inflation in business and finance are ""making short-term offshoring attractive again"" and ""could signal the start of 'Offshoring 2.0'.""

""Remote working is something of a double-edged sword for employees, especially those in tech and finance,"" she said.

""Almost everyone likes it. But it's set to lead to more outsourcing overseas.""

Mexico is a potential destination for these jobs, which are less likely to move to India than they once were because the country has a staffing shortage, she said.

IT roles 'being moved to Eastern Europe'

LaFosse Associates, a recruitment firm with a focus on technology, said they are seeing some IT support roles being moved outside the UK.

""What you could find here in the UK, you can now find cheaper elsewhere,"" said Lucas Howman, head of digital outcomes.

He told Sky News many of their large corporate clients are choosing to base these roles in Eastern European countries, where salaries are lower but time zones are similar.

He said there has also been a rise in ""anywhere jobs"" where candidates can choose whether they want to be based in the UK or elsewhere.

With applicants from around the world applying for these jobs, he acknowledged that ""it does make it more competitive"".

""You have to weigh your own pros and cons,"" he said.

Internal support roles 'could be offshored'

Odgers Berndtson, another global recruiter, told Sky News the pandemic has shown employers that many roles they thought could only be done in a UK office can be done anywhere.

Mark Freebairn, partner and head of the board and CFO practices, said that before 2020, regulators would have ""fainted"" if they had been told private data was going to be handled from people's homes - but this is now the norm.

He said the jobs being considered for offshoring tend to be ones delivering services to internal staff, such as IT, facility management, back office finance and back office HR - or ones where teams are already spread out across the world.

""Has the market reached a defined conclusion?"" he said. ""No. Are people starting to make moves to explore that? 100% Yes.""

How can people protect their jobs?

Asked what people can do to protect their jobs from offshoring, he said: ""Instinctively, my answer is: be more present.

""Show the people that are going to be making those decisions the value in having you around.

""If you're sat at home, saying to everyone 'I can do my job from my home, don't need to be in the office', you are basically saying to everybody, 'this job can be done from anywhere. As long as I'm prepared to be awake at the time when I need to be, I can do this from Australia, China, Latvia, Finland, Canada, Alaska - it doesn't make any difference'.""

He said it is difficult to predict what is going to happen because it is still not known how much of work will keep being done remotely after the threat of the pandemic recedes.

The proof of this uncertainty is in the fact that many employers have not given up some of their office spaces yet - even as they sit empty and cost them significant amounts of money, he said.

If most people end up back in the office three or four days a week, he said ""we're pretty much back to where we were, in which case the gains that we make by doing offshoring - or whatever it might be - become much more marginal"".

Remote work 'like chocolate'

When his company surveyed workers, he said they found that most people want to continue working from home as much as they want in the future - but most also said they really miss the collegiate nature of working with others in an office.

""My metaphor is: a five-year-old will simultaneously be sick for eating too much chocolate whilst asking for more chocolate,"" he said.

""And at some point, someone's got to step in and say 'no, if you eat more chocolate you'll carry on being sick and that's not good for you'.

""We're sort of at that point a bit.

""And at the moment, everyone's worried that if they're the one that says 'no stop eating chocolate', the child will resign.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220131060845/http://news.sky.com/story/is-your-job-at-risk-the-roles-most-likely-to-be-moved-out-of-the-uk-due-to-remote-working-12527495;

Isolation periods for those who test positive for COVID have also been cut from 14 days to 10 day, with further reductions if the person has a negative test on days five and six.

Care homes will have to follow outbreak management rules for 14 days, rather than 28; and by 16 February care workers will be asked to take lateral flow tests before their shifts, replacing the current system of weekly PCR tests.

In December, it was announced care home residents would only be allowed three named people as regular visitors, in an effort to protect them from the rapidly-spreading Omicron variant.

The government said it changed the rules for care home visits ""to balance the current COVID-19 risk and the need to keep people safe in line with clinical advice"".

Staff testing was also increased to three lateral flow tests per week, as well as a weekly PCR.

COVID crisis: Are care homes now safer?

Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said last week: ""I know how vital companionship is to those living in care homes and the positive difference visits make, which is why we continued to allow three named visitors and an essential care giver under Plan B measures.

Boris Johnson is yet to receive a copy of senior civil servant Sue Gray's report, but it is expected in a matter of days.

A redacted version of the report is also likely to be made public this week, the redactions being in line with a request from the Metropolitan Police, which is also investigating the Downing Street gatherings.

On Friday evening the Met said it had received information to support its investigation, but said it was not trying to delay the release of Ms Gray's report.

Commander Catherine Roper, who leads the Met's Central Specialist Crime Command, said the timing of the document's release was a matter for the Cabinet Office.

Ms Roper also said the force had asked for ""minimal reference"" to be made in the report to the ""relevant events"", to ""protect the integrity of the police investigation"" and to be ""as fair as possible to those who are subject to it"".

""This will only be necessary until these matters are concluded, and is to give detectives the most reliable picture of what happened at these events. We intend to complete our investigations promptly, fairly and proportionately,"" she said.

""We have not delayed this report and the timing of its release is a matter for the Cabinet Office inquiry team.""

Ms Roper said the offences under investigation, if proven, would normally result in the issuing of a fixed penalty notice.

""Should a recipient dispute the fixed penalty notice then the case will be referred back to the Met where officers will consider whether to pursue the matter in a magistrates' court,"" she said.

""As the commissioner said, we will not be giving a running commentary but we will continue to update when significant progress is made in the investigative process.""

While he waits, the prime minister is expected to unveil plans for a ""Brexit Freedoms Bill"", allowing retained EU laws to be more easily removed.

Health workers in England were meant to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by April, but Health Secretary Sajid Javid has been under growing pressure to scrap the rule.

There have been concerns that the sector could be left with a massive staffing crisis due to the number of workers choosing not to be vaccinated.

Speaking to Kay Burley, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said Omicron was now the dominant variant of COVID and was generally resulting in milder disease than other strains.

""Any decision that's taken this week will reflect that reality,"" he said.

""I can't prejudge the decision that is going to be made, but obviously we do recognise those realities and that does open a space where we can look at this again.""

According to the Daily Telegraph, the health secretary will meet with ministers on the COVID-operations cabinet committee on Monday, where he is expected to confirm the U-turn.

Mr Clarke said the policy of mandatory jabs is something that ministers have ""always kept under review"".

""We've been trying to strike, throughout this pandemic, the right balance between having the maximum impact in terms of measures that support public safety in the face of the virus, but also have the minimum impact in terms of our wider freedoms as a society,"" he said.

Both the Royal College of GPs and the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) had urged for the deadline to be postponed and the British Medical Association called for an ""urgent impact assessment"" on how the policy would affect staffing numbers.

Conservatives MPs welcomed news of the expected U-turn, with Romford MP Andrew Rosindell writing on Twitter: ""These free-thinking NHS workers' jobs are saved and quite right too.

""Well done all those who had the courage to stand up for the values of a free society.""

Forest of Dean MP Mark Harper added: ""My backbench colleagues and I have been pushing hard to spare the sack for tens of thousands of NHS and care workers.

Analysis by Tamara Cohen



The threat of Sue Gray’s report, and whether or not it will galvanise Tory MPs to oust him, still hangs over Boris Johnson.

But meanwhile the business of government must go on. Today we expect an announcement of more severe sanctions the government intends to apply to the assets of Russian individuals and companies if Putin’s troops invade Ukraine.

Both the prime minister and foreign secretary are expected to visit the snowy Russian borderlands in the first half of this week. Treasury minister Simon Clarke claimed this morning that Boris Johnson is ""standing up to Putin"" while other countries ""drag their feet"".

Domestically, the PM has tried to stamp out speculation he was about to U-turn on the proposed National Insurance hike – due in April – in a joint article with the Chancellor on Sunday saying it must go ahead, in a sign he will not respond to the partygate crisis by giving in to every demand of Tory rebels.

The government's long-awaited levelling-up plans, including what critics have seized on as a reheated announcement from last year's spending review, will be published on Wednesday. And dozens of the prime minister's fiercest Tory critics will be cheered if – as suspected – the plan to force NHS workers to be double jabbed is now dropped.

The PM's allies hope Sue Gray's report, not as yet handed to Downing Street, will now be so significantly neutered due to material taken out at the behest of the Met police and so jar with the seriousness of the gathering threat of war in Europe and cost of living crisis, that he survives even a damaging write-up of his conduct.

The immediate moment which the PM's enemies had hoped might trigger a no-confidence vote did not come last week as planned. But it still may throw this week’s plans up in the air.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220131100903/http://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-latest-news-uk-sue-gray-report-parties-partygate-live-12514080;

The consultant anaesthetist, who has been treating coronavirus patients since the start of the pandemic, told Kay Burley on Monday he was surprised to even be offered the jab.

He said: ""I never thought I would need to be vaccinated. I always thought healthy people wouldn't be offered the vaccine; it was going to go to vulnerable people.""

NHS staff, he said, ""do not want to be coerced"" into getting a vaccine and making them mandatory is ""wrong"".

Speaking for himself, he said he believes he has ""natural immunity"" after contracting the virus earlier in the pandemic.

Asked if he accepted the view of other medics that he is being selfish, he replied ""okay"", while suggesting 100,000 of his colleagues in the NHS feel the same.

People are unwilling to take it, he said, because it's ""still in experimental trial stages, [it's] a vaccine that has side effects that are not really clearly talked about at present and people are concerned that they are higher than are being shared"".

The vaccine, he added, ""isn't very effective at stopping serious disease in a healthy population, because a healthy population doesn't very get serious disease from COVID"".

Dr James said data showing vaccines increase levels of immunity doesn't take into account those who have natural immunity and doesn't apply to Omicron.

""I will not be having a vaccination, not unless the entire landscape of COVID and the vaccine changes and vaccine mandates are wrong.""

He also questioned the reliability of data on asymptomatic transmission, calling it ""not real world data"", as it came from ""computer model engineering"".

George Seda, the police commander for the region, said that the blast occurred outside the town of Mandera, in the northeastern part of Kenya, near the borders of Somalia and Ethiopia.

It is not clear how many people were in the vehicle, which local media say was a matatu, a type of privately owned shared taxi or minibus.

Witnesses said the number killed could rise because others have been seriously injured.

Police suspect the explosive device was placed by al Shabaab extremists operating in the area, who had come from Somalia.

The attackers fled towards the border, a police report said on Monday.

The Netherlands and German embassies also asked their citizens to be alert.

The launch of the Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) was first reported by South Korean and Japanese authorities.

North Korea's state news agency KCNA released a set of images showing both the launch of the missile and photos of Earth it says were taken from a camera installed on the missile's warhead.

Image: North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-Un, pictured in Pyongyang in December last year Pic: AP

It was the seventh test conducted by North Korea this month and the first time a nuclear-capable missile of that size has been launched since 2017.

North Korea has previously said the Hwasong-12 can carry a ""large-size heavy nuclear warhead"", and analysts estimate it has a range of 2,800 miles (4,500km).

Sunday's test ""confirmed the accuracy, safety, and operational effectiveness of the produced Hwasong-12 type weapon system"", North Korean state news agency KCNA reported.

State media coverage of the launch made no mention of the United States, and leader Kim Jong Un was not reported to have attended.

North Korean officials said this month the tests are for self defence and not targeted at any specific country.

However, the range of the missile is sufficient to reach Guam, home to US military bases that in past times of tensions sent advanced warplanes to the Korean Peninsula in shows of force.

In August 2017, at the height of animosities with the then-Trump administration, North Korea threatened to make ""an enveloping fire"" near Gaum with Hwasong-12 missiles.

The US is concerned North Korea's escalating missile tests could be precursors to resumed tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and vowed an unspecified response ""designed to show our commitment to our allies"", a senior US official told Reuters reporters in Washington.

Some experts say North Korea's recent testing spree is meant to win sanction relief or international recognition as a legitimate nuclear state.

North Korea has said it is open to diplomacy, but that Washington's overtures are undermined by its support for sanctions and joint military drills and arms build-ups in South Korea and the region.

Amid a flurry of diplomacy in 2018, including summits with Donald Trump, Mr Kim declared his nuclear force complete and said he would suspend nuclear testing and launches of the country's longest-range missiles.

Image: A railway-born missile is launched during firing drills according to state media on 14 January

He said he was no longer bound by that moratorium after talks stalled in 2019, and North Korea suggested this month it could restart those testing activities because the US had shown no sign of dropping its ""hostile policies"".

It is unclear if IRBMs such as the Hwasong-12 were included in Mr Kim's moratorium, but none had been tested since 2017.

South Korean Defence Minister Suh Wook visited his country's Army Missile Command on Monday to check its readiness in the face of the North Korean launches, the ministry said in a statement.

""North Korea's series of missile test-fires, including intermediate-range ballistic missiles, pose a direct and serious threat to us and a grave challenge to international peace and stability,"" Suh said after being briefed. ""We will maintain a full military readiness posture that can respond immediately to any situation.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220131120847/http://news.sky.com/story/north-korea-confirms-test-launch-of-biggest-ballistic-missile-in-years-12529306;

Health workers in England were meant to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by April, but Sajid Javid has been under growing pressure to get rid of the rule.

There have been concerns that the sector could be left with a massive staffing crisis due to the number of workers choosing not to be vaccinated.

Asked if the government was about to perform a U-turn, the prime minister said: ""My view on NHS workers, everybody involved in looking after vulnerable people, all healthcare professionals should get a vaccine. That's absolutely clear.

""I think that Sajid Javid, the health secretary, is saying a bit more later on about how you might deal with different variants of coronavirus because they have different implications when it comes to transmission.""

Government recognises 'realities' of current situation

Speaking to Kay Burley on Sky News earlier, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said the current coronavirus situation ""does open a space"" to look again at the policy.

Mr Clarke said Omicron was now the dominant variant of COVID and was generally resulting in milder disease than other strains.

""Any decision that's taken this week will reflect that reality,"" he said.

""I can't prejudge the decision that is going to be made, but obviously we do recognise those realities and that does open a space where we can look at this again.""

According to the Daily Telegraph, the health secretary will meet ministers on the COVID-operations cabinet committee on Monday, where he is expected to confirm the U-turn.

Mr Clarke said the policy of mandatory jabs is something that ministers have ""always kept under review"".

""We've been trying to strike, throughout this pandemic, the right balance between having the maximum impact in terms of measures that support public safety in the face of the virus, but also have the minimum impact in terms of our wider freedoms as a society,"" he said.

Tory MPs welcome reports of U-turn

Both the Royal College of GPs and the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) had urged for the deadline to be postponed and the British Medical Association called for an ""urgent impact assessment"" on how the policy would affect staffing numbers.

Conservative MPs welcomed news of the expected U-turn, with Romford MP Andrew Rosindell writing on Twitter: ""These free-thinking NHS workers' jobs are saved and quite right too.

""Well done all those who had the courage to stand up for the values of a free society.""

Isaac Herzog is making his first state visit to the Gulf state, two years after the countries forged diplomatic relations under the Abraham Accords, agreements that were brokered by the United States.

He arrived on Sunday and early on Monday morning, decided to continue with his visit after the Emirati defence ministry said it intercepted and destroyed a Houthi missile, the debris from which fell on an uninhabited area.

Earlier, on Sunday, Mr Herzog had discussed security and bilateral relationship with the UAE's rule, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

On a visit to Dubai's Expo 2020 world fair on Monday, Israel's president, who holds a ceremonial role in the country's parliamentary democracy, said: ""I hope and I believe that more and more nations will soon follow the UAE lead and join the Abraham Accords.""

The UAE, by signing up to the Abraham Accords, was the first normalise relations between an Arab country and Israel since Jordan in 1994. Since then, Arab League members Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco have reached similar agreements with Israel.

Before the accords, it was impossible to telephone Israel from the UAE and there were no direct flights. Most Israelis couldn't visit the country.

En route to the UAE, Mr Herzog's plane flew over Saudi Arabia, which the Israeli president said was ""a very moving moment"".

Riyadh has yet to follow its Gulf neighbours in solidifying ties with Israel, but Israeli officials express hope this will happen.

The US-brokered normalisation agreements between the UAE, Bahrain and Israel were signed at the White House in September 2020, but have angered the Palestinians.

Increased tensions amid historic talks

In the last two weeks, Houthi rebels have twice attacked the UAE with drones and missiles.

Overnight, the Emirati defence minister said a missile was intercepted at 12.20am (local time) and destroyed.

Image: Mr Herzog's trip will continue, despite increased security concerns after an attack by the Houthi rebels

Both the Emirates and the US condemned the attack.

The UAE did not say where the missile came down and what happened is difficult to verify as the country's top prosecutor has threatened anyone, including journalists, who films or posts images of incidents like the missile and drone attacks, that they would face criminal charges in the UAE.

Some 30 minutes after the attack, the Emirates' defence ministry released black-and-white footage it said showed the destruction of a ballistic missile launcher in Yemen's al Jawf.

The Houthi group, meanwhile, said it had fired a number of ballistic missiles at Abu Dhabi and also launched several drones at Dubai.

Yahya Sari, the military spokesman for the Iran-aligned Houthis, said in a television warning that the headquarters of international businesses in the UAE will be targeted in the coming period.

The UAE is part of a Saudi-led coalition which entered Yemen's conflict in March 2015 in support of the internationally recognised government against the Houthis.

What happens now?

The senior civil servant's findings are expected to be made public within hours and the prime minister will make a statement in the House of Commons from around 3.30pm which will then be followed by questions from MPs.

Mr Johnson's spokesman said: ""The findings will be published on gov.uk and made available in the House of Commons library this afternoon and the prime minister will then provide a statement to the House after people have had the opportunity to read and consider the findings.""

Downing Street has said it will publish the report in the full form it has received from the inquiry, but the PM's spokesman said he ""can't confirm at this point"" if what has been removed from the Gray report because of the Met's investigation will ever be published.

Sources have told Sky News the update is a version of the report that complies with the Metropolitan Police's request that it make only ""minimal reference"" to events that are being looked at as part of its criminal probe, rather than the full details of all events examined during the investigation.

According to Sky's deputy political editor Sam Coates, the use of the word ""update"" to describe the document given to Downing Street indicates a full document will still be released by Ms Gray once the police investigation concludes.

In his latest comments on Monday morning, Mr Johnson said he ""sticks absolutely to what he's said in the past"" about alleged breaches of COVID rules in Downing Street.

Speaking on a visit to the port in Tilbury, Essex, the PM would not be drawn when asked whether the report would be a ""whitewash"" after the Met's request.

Although the PM has committed to publishing the report in full, opposition parties have expressed fears that redactions could mean the details of the most serious breaches will never be made public.

Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, recently said he wanted the report published ""in full and the investigation finished as quickly as possible"", claiming the government was ""paralysed"" by the police probe.

""Any issues of prejudice have got to be worked through but this whole mess, this whole paralysing of politics, is being caused by the prime minister and his wrongdoing,"" he said.

How did we get here?

Mr Johnson has come under pressure to resign over the partygate revelations concerning gatherings that took place in Downing Street and across Whitehall in 2020 and 2021 when COVID-19 restrictions were in place.

If the Cabinet Office report is critical of the PM - particularly if the findings indicate he may have misled parliament - it could further imperil his position and spark a no-confidence vote in his leadership if enough of his Conservative MPs demand a contest.

In the latest revelation, Number 10 has admitted the PM had a birthday celebration inside Downing Street during the first COVID lockdown in 2020.

Mr Johnson has already admitted attending a garden party in Downing Street in May of that year, which was described by one of his aides as a ""bring your own booze"" event.

The revelation that officials held two parties in Downing Street the day before the Queen sat alone at Prince Philip's funeral in April last year also provoked fury.

Ms Duffield, who said she cannot afford to take libel action against those making the comments, hit out at the party's leadership, claiming: ""Neither the Labour Party or either the former or current Leader or the Whips' Office have done anything at all to stop it, to offer me any support, help or legal assistance.""

She praised Kent Police, the security team in parliament and the office of Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, but added: ""It is the Labour Party that have offered me no support at all since I unexpectedly became an MP 5 years ago.

""I am today considering my future in the Party very carefully.""

Ms Duffield missed the party's annual conference in September on security advice.

It came after reports she had received online threats from transgender campaigners.

Ms Duffield has previously been branded a ""transphobe"" on social media for making the comment that ""only women have a cervix"".

She has also been criticised for her opposition to transgender women being able to access single-sex spaces such as domestic violence refuges, school toilets and prisons.

But the MP said ""this issue in no way relates to my stance on women's rights"".

Police said she fell from an apartment building in Manhattan, New York, and her death was most likely the result of suicide.

She was pronounced dead at the scene on West 42nd Street, where her body was found at about 7am on Sunday morning.

Her family said in a statement: ""In devastation and great sorrow, we share the passing of our beloved Cheslie.

""Her great light was one that inspired others around the world with her beauty and strength.

""She cared, she loved, she laughed and she shined.

""Cheslie embodied love and served others, whether through her work as an attorney fighting for social justice, as Miss USA and as a host on Extra.

""But most importantly, as a daughter, sister, friend, mentor and colleague - we know her impact will live on.""

Kryst won the Miss USA pageant in May 2019 and was a top 10 finisher in the Miss Universe competition that year.

When she was crowned, it made history as it was the first time three black women were the reigning Miss USA, Miss Teen USA and Miss America, according to NBC New York.

Although her fame came from her pageant achievements, she was also a lawyer who worked for a firm based in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Won Miss North Carolina on fifth attempt

Kryst was born on 28 April 1991 in Jackson, Michigan, and went to high school in South Carolina before graduating with honours from the University of South Carolina.

She earned a law degree and a master's of business administration from Wake Forest University.

We are devastated to learn about the loss of Miss USA 2019 Cheslie Kryst. She was one of the brightest, warmest, and most kind people we have ever had the privilege of knowing.

Kryst told the North Carolina Bar Association's blog in 2019 that she was inspired to enter pageant competitions by her mother, April Simpkins, who was Mrs North Carolina in 2002.

""Her title provided her with a platform to advocate for issues that were important to her and people listened,"" Kryst said.

It took Kryst five tries to win the North Carolina title before she went on to take Miss USA.

She acknowledged her tenacity by citing a quote widely attributed to Winston Churchill: ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""

'Passionate about criminal justice reform'

Her time at the Charlotte offices of the law firm Poyner Spruill LLP appeared to be fruitful, reaching the position of diversity adviser in 2020 after her pageant sabbatical in 2019.

Kryst received an Emmy nomination in 2020 for her work as New York correspondent at Extra, a popular entertainment programme in the US.

In an article for The Times, Nikki da Costa - the prime minister's former head of legislative affairs - said a proposal to allow families to meet indoors to support one another through their grief was rejected by Number 10 because it was thought it would ""send the wrong message to the public"".

The policy would have allowed those who had lost close family, had a miscarriage or been through the stillbirth of a child or neonatal death to form bereavement support bubbles.

Ms da Costa, who left her role in Downing Street in September 2021, claims the decision not to go ahead with bereavement bubbles came just weeks before Number 10 staff held parties on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral in April 2021.

PM's former aide says bereavement bubble plans were vetoed

She said she felt ""frustrated"" to hear some in Downing Street calling for the public to get ""a sense of proportion"" when they had knowingly taken decisions against COVID rules themselves.

""As we prepared the road map out of lockdown in 2021, I and others pushed again for a policy that had been discounted previously because infection rates were so high: to allow bereavement support bubbles for those who had lost close family, suffered miscarriage, the stillbirth of a child or neonatal death,"" Ms da Costa wrote in The Times.

""It was worked up as an option for Step 2, the transmission impact would not have been significant, and it was included in a submission to the prime minister. Three days later it was unpicked.""

Ms da Costa said Number 10 vetoed the plans as it was thought that an expansion of support bubbles ""would signal that everyone could relax their guard"".

""And this is why I am angry when I see some saying it's important to get a sense of proportion, because if we in Number 10 could be that hard-hearted because we thought it was the right thing to do, then those involved in those kinds of decisions also owed it to the country to be as hard on themselves and their own conduct,"" she continued.

What were the COVID support bubble rules?

The government introduced COVID support bubbles in June 2020 which allowed adults living alone or single parents living alone with children under the age of 18 to mix indoors without adhering to social distancing rules.

The police allowed elderly people who were living alone and not shielding to form a bubble with one friend or family member and couples who did not live together to visit and stay with each other - so long as one of them was living alone.

The support bubble rule allowed those eligible to group with another household and, together, to be treated as a single household.

It meant they could visit each other in their homes rather than meeting outside as everyone else had to at the time.

PM's former aide: Number 10 'failed' public

In her newspaper article, Ms da Costa also said Downing Street officials have ""failed"" to be ""honest and upfront"" about the allegations of parties held in Number 10 and across Whitehall when COVID rules were in place.

Ms da Costa, who also worked for former PM Theresa May, wrote: ""If we in Number 10 could be that hard-hearted because we thought it was the right thing to do, then those involved in those kinds of decisions also owed it to the country to be as hard on themselves and their own conduct.""

She added: ""If Number 10 failed in that as a collective, as it seems clear, it needs to be recognised as a failure of and by those at the top.""

Her comments come as the wait for the report into ""partygate"" to be published continues.

Compiled by senior civil servant Sue Gray, the report is expected to be heavily redacted following a decision by the Metropolitan Police to start its own inquiry into the events.

Last week, the force has asked Ms Gray to include ""minimal reference"" to parties that will form the basis of its inquiries.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220131130904/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-bereaved-support-bubble-plan-rejected-by-no-10-as-it-would-send-wrong-message-to-public-pms-ex-aide-claims-12529352;

In letters from prison, German drifter Christian B - as he is known in the German judicial system - wrote that he survived as a drug dealer because he was careful.

""I was never caught by the police because I followed a few key principles.

Image: German prosecutors believe Christian B abducted Madeleine

""Where possible, only driving during the day so that my battered 'hippy bus' didn't attract attention, only driving on the roads I needed to and, most importantly, never provoking the police. So that means not committing any crimes, certainly not abducting anyone.""

Christian B is currently serving a seven-year sentence in a German prison for the rape of an elderly American widow in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in 2005, two years before three-year-old Madeleine vanished from the family's rented holiday apartment in the same resort.

German prosecutors believe he abducted Madeleine and have been building a case against him for three years, though they have not arrested or questioned him.

It's the first time Christian B, 44, has responded publicly to various statements from prosecutors in the German city of Braunschweig, where investigators are working with support from Scotland Yard detectives and Portuguese police.

Eighteen months ago his lawyer Friedrich Fulscher stopped Christian B from corresponding with Sky News, but it's believed the suspect wrote out of frustration that his own denial had not been heard.

In his letters to reporter Jetta Rabe of the Sat1 TV entertainment channel, Christian B wrote that he had nothing to do with Madeleine's disappearance.

""Having said that, this was just as absurd to me at the time as starting a nuclear war or slaughtering a chicken.""

He added: ""I see no reason to comment on the accusations made by the Braunschweig public prosecutor's office. In theory, I could sit back and relax and just wait for the findings.""

Christian B, who has convictions for child sex offences, had travelled between Praia da Luz and Germany in a camper van for several years before Madeleine vanished in May 2007.

Prosecutors say they have a compelling but circumstantial file of evidence against him, including data records that show his mobile telephone was in use on the night close to the Ocean Club complex where Madeleine's parents had left her and her younger twin siblings asleep in their unlocked apartment while they dined with friends nearby.

In a documentary the Sat1 producers say they will also reveal evidence that Christian B had carried out repair work at the holiday centre.

Prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said: ""We are grateful to the Sat1 team for sharing certain findings with the public prosecutor's office.

""There are witnesses who might prefer to speak to the media than to us or the police. If this produces any ideas, we will of course follow these up.""

The German authorities are currently investigating Christian B over three separate sex crime allegations, including the rape of an Irish holiday worker.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220131155723/https://news.sky.com/story/madeleine-mccann-suspect-claims-it-would-have-been-absurd-for-him-to-have-abducted-her-12529606;

Sarah Moulds appeared in court after a video was shared online which appeared to show a woman repeatedly hitting the animal when it ran into the road.

The footage led to Ms Moulds losing her job at the Mowbray Education Trust in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, in December last year.

Appearing at Boston Magistrates' Court, the 37-year-old spoke only to confirm her name, address and date of birth and that she indicated she would give pleas of not guilty during a brief hearing.

Ms Moulds is accused of two offences under the Animal Welfare Act against a grey pony called Bruce Almighty.

The RSPCA allege she caused him unnecessary suffering by ""kicking and hitting"" him, and by failing to take reasonable steps to protect the animal from pain, suffering, injury or disease.

The date of the allegations is 6 November last year, in the area around The Drift in Gunby, Lincolnshire.

Ms Moulds is reported to have been participating in the Cottesmore Hunt, one of Britain's oldest foxhound packs, when the alleged incident occurred.

Widespread outrage after footage shared

The RSPCA investigated the footage of the alleged incident that had been posted by the Hertfordshire Hunt Saboteurs, activists who are against hunting.

The animal charity had appealed to the public for information, describing the video as ""really upsetting"".

Animal lover Ricky Gervais retweeted the video to his 14 million followers, while TV presenter and conservationist Chris Packham also shared it.

The backlash led to Ms Moulds being removed from a voluntary position at a local pony club, while the Cottesmore Hunt said a ""thorough internal investigation"" had meant a ""follower will not participate in trail hunting"" with them.

The former teacher was granted unconditional bail and will now face a trial.

However, Rogan has now promised to be more ""balanced"" and Spotify is introducing a ""content advisory"" to any podcast episode that discusses coronavirus.

Amid the controversy, more than $2bn (about £1.5bn) was wiped off Spotify's market value last week.

Here, Sky News takes a look at how it started, the artists taking a stand, and what Spotify and Rogan have said about it.

Who is Joe Rogan?

With a podcast listened to by millions around the world, there are already plenty of Joe Rogan fans out there. But for those who don't know who he is, Rogan, 54, is a stand-up comedian, MMA enthusiast and commentator and former reality TV host, who launched The Joe Rogan Experience podcast in 2009.

Billed as a long-form conversation show, it has amassed a huge following over the years and featured everyone from Bernie Sanders and Elon Musk - who infamously smoked cannabis during the interview - to Miley Cyrus and Kanye West.

Spotify acquired The Joe Rogan Experience in 2020, reportedly for more than $100m (£77m), and it is the top-rated podcast on the platform.

Rogan has previously attracted controversy over his COVID-19 views, having suggested the young and healthy should not get vaccinated. He has also said he used ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug used mainly on horses that has no proven benefit against COVID, after contracting the virus.

How did the row start?

Earlier in January, some 270 scientists and medical professionals signed an open letter to Spotify urging bosses to take action against Rogan, accusing him of spreading falsehoods on the podcast.

Then, Neil Young, 76, threatened to pull his music from the streaming service.

Image: Neil Young says he is prepared to take the hit on his streaming income

Young - who contracted polio as a child, shortly before the vaccine for the disease became available, fans have pointed out - posted a letter on his website addressed to his manager and his record label, Warner Music Group, demanding that Spotify no longer carry his music. It has since been deleted.

""I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform... They can have Rogan or Young. Not both,"" Young wrote in the letter, according to US media reports.

The following day, Young posted again on his website, saying that while Spotify represented 60% of his worldwide streaming income, it had become a ""damaging force"" and he was ""taking the hit... in the name of truth"".

Young is best known for hits including Heart Of Gold, Rocking In The Free World and Cinnamon Girl. His music has now been removed from the platform, with Spotify saying it ""regrets"" the musician's decision.

The streaming giant said it tried to achieve balance, having removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to COVID since the start of the pandemic.

Which other artists are involved?

A few day's after Young's decision, Joni Mitchell announced she was standing ""in solidarity"" with the star by removing her music from Spotify.

Image: Joni Mitchell says she stands in 'solidarity' with Young

Mitchell said the streaming giant was allowing ""irresponsible people"" to spread lies that were ""costing people their lives"".

""I've decided to remove all my music from Spotify,"" Mitchell said in a statement on her official website. ""Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives. I stand in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue.""

Mitchell, 78, is another Grammy winner, best known for songs including Big Yellow Taxi and Chelsea Morning.

There was speculation on social media that Barry Manilow would also follow suit. However, the singer released a statement on Twitter saying he did not know where the reports had come from.

What has this got to do with Harry and Meghan?

In 2020, Prince Harry and Meghan signed a lucrative multi-year partnership with Spotify for an undisclosed sum - estimated to be worth around $25m (about £18m), in late 2020.

The deal was to host and produce podcasts under their brand Archewell Audio. However, apart from a ""holiday special"" released on 29 December 2020, they have not released any other material.

Image: Harry and Meghan signed a deal with Spotify in 2020

Commenting on the Rogan row, the couple claimed they expressed concerns about the spread of misinformation on the platform last April. However, they said they would continue to work with the company.

In a statement sent to Sky News, an Archewell spokesperson said: ""Since the inception of Archewell, we have worked to address the real-time global misinformation crisis. Hundreds of millions of people are affected by the serious harms of rampant mis- and disinformation every day.

""Last April, our co-founders began expressing concerns to our partners at Spotify about the all too real consequences of COVID-19 misinformation on its platform. We have continued to express our concerns to Spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis.

""We look to Spotify to meet this moment and are committed to continuing our work together as it does.""

What has Spotify said?

On 30 January, bosses for the platform announced it will now add a ""content advisory"" to any podcast episode which discusses coronavirus.

The streaming giant's chief executive Daniel Ek also said that ""long-standing platform rules"" will be published to be more transparent about ""the policies that guide our content more broadly"".

Image: Spotify boss Daniel Ek says podcasts about COVID will now come with a 'content advisory'

In a post on Spotify's website announcing the steps being taken, Mr Ek said: ""Personally, there are plenty of views on Spotify that I disagree with strongly... it is important to me that we don't take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them.""

He then went on to outline how any podcast episode about COVID will now be accompanied by a content advisory.

""This advisory will direct listeners to our dedicated COVID-19 Hub, a resource that provides easy access to data-driven facts, up-to-date information as shared by scientists, physicians, academics and public health authorities around the world, as well as links to trusted sources,"" he said.

Mr Ek said the company would also begin publishing its platform rules, which tell contributors not to promote dangerous, deceptive, sensitive or illegal content on its platform, and guidance adds that ""breaking the rules may result in the violative content being removed"".

Mr Ek also said the company will ""begin testing ways to highlight our platform rules in our creator and publisher tools to raise awareness around what's acceptable and help creators understand their accountability for the content they post on our platform"".

Spotify shares were up 2% in pre-market trading on Monday but still at their lowest since May 2020, after the controversy

and a broader sell-off of tech stocks in January eroded more than a quarter of the platform's value.

Rogan's pledge

Following the post by Mr Ek, Rogan released a 10-minute video on social media to address the controversy, saying he will try to ""balance out"" the opinions expressed on his show and that he supports Spotify's content advisory plans.

Image: Rogan says he wants to 'show all kinds of opinions' on his show

Responding to claims he has spread dangerous misinformation about the virus, the podcaster said he was ""interested in having conversations with people that have differing opinions"" and was not focused on ""only talking to people that have one perspective"".

He apologised if he offended anyone and added that he ""was not trying to promote misinformation"". However, he said he would ""try harder to get people with differing opinions"" immediately after those with controversial opinions who appear.

""So my pledge to you so that I will do my best to try to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people's perspectives so we can maybe find a better point of view,"" he said.

""I don't want to just show the contrary opinion to what the narrative is. I want to show all kinds of opinions so that we can all figure out what's going on and not just about COVID, but about everything about health, about fitness, wellness, the state of the world itself.""

Analysis: A positive step - but more work still to be done Victoria Elms Digital investigations journalist @victoriaelms Spotify's announcement marks a positive step towards addressing misinformation on the platform. But while it tells us more about the kind of content Spotify says it does not allow, it does not reveal what the company is doing to enforce these rules behind the scenes. A Sky News investigation last year found more than 150 hours of hateful content on the platform, which the company removed after we reported it to them. But just how much Spotify is doing to seek out and remove violative content beyond responding to user reports is not known.

Sky News Spotify investigation

COVID-19 aside, a Sky News investigation in December 2021 found antisemitic, racist and white supremacist material in podcasts on Spotify.

We found podcasts totalling several days' worth of listening promoting extreme views such as scientific racism, Holocaust denial and far-right antisemitic conspiracy theories.

While some of the most shocking material was buried inside hours-long episodes, in some cases, explicit slurs could be found in episode titles and descriptions while album artwork displayed imagery adopted by white supremacists.

Spotify removed the content after we reported it to the streaming giant and said it does not allow hate content on its platform.

Key points in the version of the Gray report include:

• 16 events in 2020 and 2021 were investigated - the Met Police are looking into 12 of them

• Some of the behaviour surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify

• A number of the gatherings should not have been allowed to take place or to develop in the way that they did

• At least some gatherings represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of government but also of the standards expected of the entire population

• There were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office

• The garden at 10 Downing Street was also used for gatherings without clear authorisation or oversight. This was not appropriate

• Some staff wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work but at times felt unable to do so

• Steps must be taken to ensure every government department has a ""clear and robust"" policy over excessive alcohol consumption in the workplace - which is ""not appropriate""

Analysis: Slight reprieve for Boris Johnson but Sue Gray clear full report needs to be published Beth Rigby Political editor @BethRigby Sue Gray's conclusion is clear in its criticism, and there is no getting away from it being bad for Boris Johnson, but it is also partial. As far as opposition sources are concerned the key line is on page five, where Sue Gray says it has not been possible to provide a ""meaningful report"" due to the limitations created by the ongoing Met police investigation. So when Sue Gray references the fact she has gathered significant evidence from 70 witnesses and concludes serious failures having been made, it puts the prime minister under huge pressure to commit to releasing the full document when the police investigation concludes. The prime minister is now going to have to go to parliament and explain all of this away. The partial nature of the report may have given him a slight reprieve, but Sue Gray has made clear there is a full picture waiting to be revealed to the British people. The opposition, and some in his own party, will want a commitment that will happen.

No 'meaningful report' at this stage

Last week, the Met Police launched a criminal investigation into potential breaches of COVID regulations in Downing Street and Whitehall and requested Ms Gray's report make only ""minimal reference"" to events it is looking at.

The 12 gatherings being looked into by the Met include an event that happened at the Downing Street flat on 13 November 2020, the night aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain left their Number 10 roles, and an event to mark the PM's birthday on 19 June 2020.

The Met Police revealed on Monday afternoon officers are reviewing ""at pace"" more than 300 images and 500 pages of information handed over by the Cabinet Office on Friday.

They said officers are now confirming which individuals need to be contacted for their account and will be issued with a fixed penalty notice if police deem them to have breached COVID regulations - which they can dispute in a magistrates' court.

Ms Gray said the police investigation means she is ""extremely limited in what I can say"" so it is ""not possible at present to provide a meaningful report"" setting out all she has discovered

She said she has opted not to publish factual accounts of events not under investigation by police because to do so would damage her overall findings.

A No 10 spokesman said after the Met's investigation is complete, the PM will ask Ms Gray to update her work ""in light of what is found"" and that will be published.

PM apologises

Addressing MPs in the Commons, Mr Johnson said: ""I want to say sorry - and I'm sorry for the things we simply didn't get right and also sorry for the way this matter has been handled.

""It's no use saying this or that was within the rules and it's no use saying people were working hard. This pandemic was hard for everyone.""

Mr Johnson told MPs he was making changes to the way Downing Street and the Cabinet Office are run ""so that we can get on with the job that I was elected to do and the job that this government was elected to do"".

""First it is time to sort out what Sue Gray rightly calls the fragmented and complicated leadership structures of Downing Street which she says have not evolved sufficiently to meet the demands of the expansion of Number 10 and we will do that, including by creating an office of the prime minister with a permanent secretary to lead Number 10,"" he said.

Finishing his statement, the PM said: ""I get it, and I will fix it. I want to say to the people of this country I know what the issue is.

""It is whether this government can be trusted to deliver, and I say 'yes we can be trusted to deliver'.""

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The prime minister must keep his promise to publish Sue Gray's report in full when it is available, but it is already clear what the report disclosed is the most damning conclusion possible.""

Mr Johnson reacted to Sir Keir by accusing him of failing to prosecute notorious sex offender Jimmy Savile while he was director of public prosecution, prompting Nazif Afzal, a former chief Crown prosecutor, to call the PM a ""disgrace"".

Tory MPs decide if they are supporting PM or not

The PM has come under increasing pressure to resign over the partygate revelations following the report's release.

Some of his backbenchers have already called for Mr Johnson to go, while a number of others have said they were waiting for the release of the Gray report before deciding whether to send a letter to the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs demanding a contest.

Former cabinet minister and vice-chair of the Conservative Party Andrew Mitchell told the Commons the PM no longer has his backing.

Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said if Mr Johnson fails to publish the Sue Gray report in full ""he will no longer have my support"".

And former PM Theresa May said the report demonstrates that No 10 ""was not observing the regulations they had imposed on members of the public"".

She said this means her successor ""had not read the rules or didn't understand what they meant and others around him, or they didn't think the rules applied to Number 10"".

Speaking during a visit to the Port of Tilbury, in Essex this morning, Boris Johnson said he believes it is ""absolutely clear"" that NHS staff should get vaccinated.

The prime minister said: ""My view on NHS workers, everybody involved in looking after vulnerable people, all healthcare professionals should get a vaccine. That's absolutely clear.""

There were concerns that the sector could be left with a massive staffing crisis due to the number of workers choosing not to be vaccinated.

Liz Truss said it means a much broader range of oligarchs and businesses could be sanctioned because of their significance to the Kremlin.

Until now, the UK was only able to sanction those linked to the destabilisation of Ukraine.

'Nothing is off the table'

""Whether you support Russia's aggressive actions against Ukraine, or you're of wider significance to the Kremlin, we will have the power to sanction you,"" Ms Truss said.

""Nothing is off the table and there will be nowhere to hide.

""This will amount to the toughest sanctions regime against Russia we have had in place yet, and mark the biggest change in our approach since leaving the European Union.""

Britain has so far imposed sanctions on around 180 people and 48 entities such Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014.

The prime minister's official spokesperson said: ""The Russian elite should be in no doubt that we have significant powers and will take them further, which will place massive pressure on them should they continue on this path of aggression.""

Kremlin says sanctions will backfire

It comes after the Kremlin said the UK's threats to impose economic sanctions were alarming and warned such actions would backfire by hurting British companies.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the threat was an attack on Russian businesses. He said it undermined Britain's investment climate and inflamed tensions in Europe.

Mr Peskov told a briefing that Russia will respond to any such action in a way that would be based on its interests.

PM and foreign secretary to meet Ukrainian president

Meanwhile, Downing Street has said Boris Johnson and Ms Truss will travel to Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday.

On Monday, the prime minister told reporters he will tell the leader to ""step back from the brink"".

Mr Johnson said further incursion into Ukraine would spell ""disaster for Russia"".

During a visit to the Port of Tilbury in Essex, the PM said: ""What I will say to the president, as I've said before, is that I think we really all need to step back from the brink and I think Russia needs to step back from the brink.

""I think that an invasion of Ukraine, any incursion into Ukraine beyond the territory that Russia has already taken in 2014 would be an absolute disaster for the world, but above all it would be a disaster for Russia.""

Defence secretary says eastern European countries will experience consequences of instability

Britain's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has travelled to Hungary for talks with the country's defence minister, Tibor Benko.

Mr Wallace said: ""It's really important that President Putin hears from allies and friends across Europe our disquiet and our worries about what is happening in Ukraine. It's very important to deliver some clear messages.""

The photo, published by The Guardian, showed Boris Johnson, his wife Carrie, principal private secretary Martin Reynolds and then-special adviser Dominic Cummings in the Downing Street garden.

Former health secretary Matt Hancock was also reported to be there, alongside around 20 other staff.

Police investigating: Yes

Reports of the ""bring your own booze"" party in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020 - just two months into the first lockdown - caused outrage.

First published by ITV News, the report revealed that the prime minister's principle private secretary Martin Reynolds emailed around 100 staff inviting them to ""some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"".

It read: ""Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening. Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!""

Just an hour before, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden had appeared at a Downing Street news briefing and told people they could only meet one other person from outside their household.

Around 40 staff are thought to have attended, with the PM present for around 25 minutes, he said to ""thank staff"" for their work on the pandemic.

18 June 2020: ""A gathering in the Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall on the departure of a No 10 private secretary""

Police investigating: Yes

No details have been released about a gathering at the Cabinet Office on 18 June 2020 - in either the media or in Ms Gray's report.

The Met have decided it meets the threshold to form part of their investigation, so details may be released when the force publishes its findings.

19 June 2020: ""A gathering in the Cabinet room in No 10 Downing Street on the prime minister's birthday""

Police investigating: Yes

On the afternoon of Boris Johnson's birthday in 2020, ITV News reported that several Number 10 staff gathered in the Cabinet room.

His wife Carrie Johnson allegedly presented him with a cake and everyone sung him Happy Birthday.

Later that day, ITV News claimed a number of the couple's family friends were hosted in the Downing Street flat.

Number 10 has repeatedly insisted the reports are ""totally untrue"" and that instead a maximum of six guests spent time in the garden that evening, in line with the rules at the time.

The so-called ""Christmas party"" event involved six people working in the Cabinet Office and a further six working from home.

Staff were reported to have enjoyed drinks and snacks throughout.

The Daily Telegraph first reported that two gatherings were held inside Number 10 the evening before the Queen was forced to sit alone at her husband Prince Philip's funeral.

They took place in separate parts of Downing Street but later came together - when COVID restrictions banned indoor mixing.

The first was a leaving party for the PM's then-head of communications James Slack - now deputy editor-in-chief at The Sun.

There were around 30 guests in total at both parties, with one involving a member of staff being sent to The Co-op on The Strand with a suitcase to fill with alcohol.

Reports claimed someone broke the PM's son's swing in the Downing Street garden, while one aide DJed for other staff.

Sue Gray report - live: Police handed 300 photos in ""partygate"" probe

Those Tory MPs who did support him from the backbenches appeared to be reading out whips' office handouts. Some of those MPs were very obviously reading.

Amid all the bluster and attacks on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who, as director of public prosecutions, prosecuted journalists but not Jimmy Savile, the PM claimed - was a big broken promise and a major evasion.

The broken promise came in response to former Tory chief whip Mark Harper, when the PM failed to honour his pledge to publish the Sue Gray report in full when it's handed over.

The evasion came when asked repeatedly whether he attended a party, highlighted in the Gray report, on 13 November 2020, allegedly to celebrate the sacking of Dominic Cummings.

Surrounded by some glum faces and silence on the Tory benches, the PM began by declaring: ""I get it and I will fix it"", and promising to create and office of the prime minister, an updated civil service code and a new permanent secretary appointed.

Really? Is that it? Mr Johnson then started talking about Brexit and COVID and was lucky the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, didn't interrupt him for straying out of order.

But immediately after his Jimmy Savile attack on the Labour leader came two moments of high drama. First, Theresa May said the PM didn't read the COVID rules, didn't understand them or thought they didn't apply to him. Wow!

A flustered Mr Johnson had no answer to that.

Next Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, seemed determined to get himself thrown out of the chamber by repeatedly accusing the PM of lying.

It's a stunt he's pulled before, in 2018 when John Bercow was speaker and he accused Mrs May of lying. This time, eventually, Sir Lindsay Hoyle obliged and Mr Blackford was marched out of the chamber by a sword-wielding sergeant-at-arms.

Then came another assassination attempt from the Tory backbenches. Standing alongside his close friend and ally David Davis, who two weeks ago told Mr Johnson ""In the name of God, go,"" Tory grandee Andrew Mitchell said he could no longer support the PM. Vicious.

Image: Andrew Mitchell said he could no longer support the prime minister

By this stage, there was a lot of shouting at his opponents from the PM and he sounded rattled. Then his friend Sir Bernard Jenkin rose. Relief, surely. The PM must have been hoping for some respite.

No such luck. Sir Bernard, a Brexit crony the PM appointed to the plum post of Liaison Committee chairman, said Mr Johnson would be judged on how he governs over the next few months. Ouch!

As his grilling went on the prime minister was getting more and more shifty. Quizzed by Mr Harper on publishing the full Gray report when it's delivered he said he would decide at the time. That broken promise has the potential to land the PM in big trouble.

But there was more grief from senior Tory backbenchers, led by those MPs dumped from senior posts by the prime minister. He has created a lot of enemies in his two years as prime minister.

Image: Sir Bernard Jenkin warned the PM would be judged on how he governs over the next few months

Sir Robert Buckland, sacked from the Cabinet last year, ominously told the PM he will be judged on his conduct over the next few months. It sounded like the wily Sir Robert may be poised to write a no-confidence letter to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee.

And the saintly Julian Lewis, who lost the Tory whip when he defeated the PM's candidate, Chris Grayling, for the post of chairman of the high-powered Intelligence and Security Committee, demanded publication of the full report now.

In all, after the PM answered questions for just under two hours, the whole session could have been worse, but not much.

It was two hours dominated by questions about previous denials given to MPs by the prime minister over the past few months. He kept repeating the riposte: ""Wait for the police report and Sue Gray's full report.""

If some of his statements in the Commons do turn out to have been misleading or - as Opposition MPs claim - lies, he will be in serious trouble and probably forced to resign.

With this statement, the PM will have hoped to buy himself some more time.

Joseph Kelly, 36, appeared on trial at Lanark Sheriff Court on Monday where he denied the nature of the message posted on 3 February last year.

The tweet said: ""the only good Brit soldier is a deed one, burn auld fella buuuuurn.""

The charge under the Communications Act alleges Mr Kelly made a public social media post that was ""grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character, and that did utter offensive remarks about Captain Sir Tom Moore, now deceased"".

Janet Hunter Jess, a member of the public who saw the tweet, told the court she was hurt at reading the message.

The 72-year-old, whose family served in the armed forces, said: ""To see someone wishing British soldiers dead, it still hurts me. It still hurts me that anybody would disrespect someone that had given their life for the country.""

Luzier Jeffery, Mr Kelly's then-neighbour, said she was ""shocked"" when she saw the tweet.

""First of all, the gentleman in question had done so much to raise awareness and funds for the NHS in England and became a bit of a national hero at the time, but then the fact it referred to British soldiers as well,"" the 51-year-old told the court.

""If you have had anybody who fought for your country, it just left a bad taste.""

She said she spoke to Mr Kelly after he was arrested and claimed he told her he had ""done a lot of stupid things in my time but that's one of the worst"".

""He regretted it from what I can remember, it was a spur of the moment,"" she told the court.

Cameron Smith, defending, told the court the tweet could not be described as ""grossly offensive"".

He argued that while it might be ""unpleasant"" and ""unsavoury"", it did not pass the threshold.

Mr Smith told the trial the message was not about a protected characteristic, such as race, religion, or gender, and did not incite violence.

At one point in the trial, Sheriff Adrian Cottam threatened to put Mr Kelly in the cells if he did not stop shaking his head as prosecutor Liam Haggert spoke about Sir Tom.

Sir Tom, who walked 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday to raise more than £32m for the NHS, died in Bedford Hospital on 2 February after testing positive for COVID-19.

He was knighted by the Queen in recognition of his efforts.

Those include a ""gathering in the No 10 Downing Street flat"" on 13 November, 2020 - the night Mr Johnson's former aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain left their roles.

Also under investigation is the 19 June 2020 event in which Mr Johnson was ""ambushed by cake"", in the words of minister Conor Burns, in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to mark the Prime Minister's 56th birthday. Mr Burns later insisted Mr Johnson had told him there was no cake.

Carrie Johnson, the Prime Minister's wife, reportedly organised the surprise complete with a chorus of ""happy birthday"" and interior designer Lulu Lytle also admitted attending while carrying out controversial work on their Downing Street flat.

In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said: ""Our position from the start has been that, while we don't normally investigate breaches reported long after they are said to have taken place, if significant evidence became available we would assess it. That is now the situation and why we have acted.

""As part of the investigation it is necessary for us to contact those who attended these events to get their account. As a result, the Met has requested that any information identified as part of the Cabinet Office investigation about these events, is not disclosed in detail. This request only applies for the duration of our investigation and does not apply to events we are not investigating.""

The force added: ""Having received the documentation from the Cabinet Office on Friday 28 January, we are now reviewing it at pace to confirm which individuals will need to be contacted for their account. This prioritisation will include reviewing all the material from the Cabinet Office, which includes more than 300 images and over 500 pages of information.

""If following an investigation, officers believe it is appropriate, because the Covid regulations have been breached without a reasonable excuse, a fixed penalty notice would normally be issued. Once the penalty is paid, the matter is considered closed. Alternatively individuals may decide to dispute the notice. In these circumstances officers will consider whether to pursue the matter in a magistrates' court.""

PM's apology

Mr Johnson apologised to the Commons after the publication of Ms Gray's report and promised a shake-up of No 10.

He said: ""I get it and I will fix it.""

Police investigating at least 12 gatherings

Ms Gray's report listed 16 events she had examined as part of her inquiry, but said only four were not now being investigated by the police.

""Unfortunately, this necessarily means that I am extremely limited in what I can say about those events and it is not possible at present to provide a meaningful report setting out and analysing the extensive factual information I have been able to gather,"" she said.

Here, Sky News outlines the most important points in the report.

• Sue Gray concludes that ""a number"" of gatherings ""should not have been allowed to take place or to develop in the way that they did""

• She finds that ""some of the behaviour surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify""

• Ms Gray says ""at least some of the gatherings represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time""

• Ms Gray believes there were ""failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of Number 10 and the Cabinet Office""

• An event at the Downing Street flat on 13 November 2020, the day Dominic Cummings left Number 10, is confirmed as being one of 12 events being investigated by the Metropolitan Police

• Ms Gray says the garden at No 10 Downing Street was also used for gatherings without clear authorisation or oversight. This was not appropriate, she adds.

• She acknowledges she was ""extremely limited in what I can say about those events and it is not possible at present to provide a meaningful report setting out and analysing the extensive factual information I have been able to gather""

• But she does say ""some staff wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work but at times felt unable to do so""

• She continues: ""The structures that support the smooth operation of Downing Street have not evolved sufficiently… the leadership structures are fragmented and complicated and this has sometimes led to the blurring of lines of accountability""

• She concludes: ""There is significant learning to be drawn from these events which must be addressed immediately across government"" and that ""this does not need to wait for the police investigations to be concluded""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220131214036/http://news.sky.com/story/sue-gray-report-ten-key-findings-as-it-says-lockdown-gatherings-difficult-to-justify-12529675;

The singer-songwriter was pictured displaying her bare baby bump while out in New York with her rapper boyfriend A$AP Rocky.

Despite freezing temperatures in the city, Rihanna can be seen wearing her bright pink coat open at the bottom, with nothing on underneath, to proudly share her stomach.

The couple were photographed walking around the Harlem neighbourhood, where A$AP Rocky is from, at some time on Friday or over the weekend, and the images were first published on Monday by US media outlets.

Neither Rihanna nor the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, have issued a statement confirming the news.

However, the pictures suggest the star, 33, is several months pregnant and is not hiding it.

In an interview with GQ in May 2021, Mayers, also 33, described Rihanna as ""the love of my life"". Asked if he was ready to be a father, he replied: ""If that's in my destiny, absolutely... I think I'd be an incredible, remarkably, overall amazing dad. I would have a very fly child. Very.""

Rihanna is one of the most famous women in the world and one of the biggest-selling music artists of all time, known for hits including We Found Love, Umbrella, Diamonds, Work, Rude Boy and more.

She is also a businesswoman, having launched her own fashion and beauty brands Fenty and Fenty Beauty, and was officially declared a billionaire by Forbes in August 2021.

In November 2021, she was declared a national hero by the prime minister of her home country Barbados.

Earlier in January, the star pledged $15m (£11.1m) to fighting for climate justice through her Clara Lionel Foundation, which is named after her grandparents.

The foreign secretary becomes the second member of the cabinet to test positive for COVID in the past few days, after Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi revealed a positive result from Sunday.

Ms Truss was in the House of Commons earlier today when Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologised to the country following the publication of a pared back version of the Sue Gray report.

Neither was wearing a mask during proceedings. They were separated by Home Secretary Priti Patel, also mask-less, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who was wearing a mask.

On Ms Truss's other flank was Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who was wearing a face covering.

The foreign secretary was also at a meeting of hundreds of Conservative MPs this evening.

She left the gathering early and hurried past Sky News correspondents without replying to questions.

Earlier today, Ms Truss was in the Commons to give an update on new legislation in response to Russian pressure on the Ukrainian border.

Among the measures announced were new financial restrictions on individuals who are significant to the Kremlin.

She told MPs that ""nothing is off the table and there will be nowhere to hide"".

Parents are being urged to make sure children have had their MMR vaccinations and other routine jabs before starting school.

The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. Children can receive their first dose on the NHS at the age of one, and the second dose is available when they are three years and four months old.

Between July and September last year - the most recent figures - just 88.6% of children in England had received their first MMR dose by the age of two, while just 85.5% had received both doses by the age of five.

The World Health Organisation says that 95% of children need to be vaccinated to keep measles away.

Measles is highly infectious and can cause pneumonia, encephalitis (brain inflammation), and damage to the immune system which leaves children more susceptible to other infections.

In rare cases, it can also cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which can lead to destruction of the central nervous system, loss of motor control, epilepsy, and death.

Despite this, 48% of parents and guardians of children aged five and under did not know that measles can lead to serious complications.

Potentially fatal disease

The figures, from research commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care, and the UKHSA, also found that only 38% knew measles could be fatal.

Some 56% were unaware that two doses of the MMR vaccine give 99% protection against measles and rubella.

It is estimated that the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1968 has prevented 20 million measles cases and 4,500 deaths in the UK.

The US CDC says that while rubella rarely causes serious cases in children, up to 70% of adult women may experience arthritis and it can cause serious problems, including brain infections, bleeding problems, miscarriages and birth defects.

Mumps too can result in complications, especially among adults, including inflammation of the testicles, ovaries, breast tissue, pancreas, brain and spinal cord (meningitis).

'Big impact on immunity'

Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said: ""The MMR vaccine offers the best protection from measles, mumps and rubella which is why we're calling on parents and carers to make sure their children are up to date with their two doses.

""Even a small drop in vaccine coverage can have a big impact on population immunity levels and lead to outbreaks.""

Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and medical director for primary care at NHS England, said: ""It is incredibly important that all parents and guardians ensure their child is up to date with their routine vaccinations, including MMR, as these vaccines give children crucial protection against serious and potentially deadly illnesses and stop outbreaks in the community.

""If your child has missed a vaccination, please contact your GP practice to book an appointment as soon as you can to make sure they have maximum protection against disease.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201090832/http://news.sky.com/story/measles-vaccination-rates-drop-to-their-lowest-level-in-a-decade-12530000;

""Even in the last moments of January 2021 [the night before the coup], I was with my media colleagues and we were having fun after work. Even though we were experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak, we had some freedom. But now, we have nothing.

""The positive thing is people [around the world] are noticing and understand that we are losing our rights in the country. They recognise people are being oppressed.

""I don't feel the international community has taken the situation seriously. Myanmar's junta has never cared about the international community, even though people in the early days wanted international troops [to fight against them].""

Charlotte Bellis's situation gained worldwide media attention after she said she was forced to turn to Afghanistan's Taliban for refuge after being locked out of New Zealand due to its strict COVID border policies.

In a news conference on Tuesday, New Zealand's deputy prime minister Grant Robertson said that the government department in charge of the system that ensures people do not have COVID-19 before they enter the country had now offered her a place, as well as flight arrangements.

He added: ""There is a place in MIQ (Managed Isolation and Quarantine) for Ms Bellis and I urge her to take it up.""

Bellis, who is 25 weeks pregnant, accepted the place and said in a statement: ""I will be returning to my home country New Zealand at the beginning of March to give birth to our baby girl.

""We are so excited to return home and be surrounded by family and friends at such a special time.""

Mr Robertson denied that Bellis was given preferential treatment because she had gained a worldwide audience for her complaint, resulting in embarrassment for a government proud of its COVID policies.

He said: ""What it sends is a message that the staff of (the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment) who have to deal with emergency application are dealing with very difficult and challenging cases on a daily basis.

""They always try to make contact with people and try to make arrangements that work.""

Bellis, 35, is expecting her first child with Belgian partner and news photographer Jim Huylebroek.

Both had been based in Afghanistan while Bellis reported in that country for Qatar-based news channel Al Jazeera.

She found out she was pregnant soon after returning to Qatar late last year, news that forced her to resign and leave the country, as being unmarried and pregnant is illegal.

She said she tried to stay in Belgium but the lengthy residency process would have left her with an expired visa.

In the end, she returned to Afghanistan with the reassurance of Taliban contacts that she would be safe, despite the regime's strict interpretation of Islam.

Meanwhile, she continued her attempts to find a way back to New Zealand, initially joining the many thousands of overseas-based New Zealanders trying to get a place in mandatory hotel isolation via a government-run lottery.

Image: Bellis is 25 weeks pregnant. Pic: Jim Huylebroek

The strict border policy has played a large part in the country's low COVID-19 case numbers but it has also been heavily criticised for keeping many New Zealand citizens effectively locked out of their own country.

With no success in the lottery and with her pregnancy advancing as she waited in impoverished Afghanistan, Bellis applied for allocation under the emergency scheme, which allows places for people who fit into a narrow list of categories. But she was rejected.

Her story came to light when she wrote a column in the New Zealand Herald soon afterwards, saying: ""When the Taliban offers you - a pregnant, unmarried woman - safe haven, you know your situation is messed up.""

She later said: ""It is my legal right to go to New Zealand, where I have health care, where I have family. All my support is there.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201090832/http://news.sky.com/story/pregnant-new-zealand-journalist-who-sought-refuge-in-afghanistan-after-being-locked-out-of-her-own-country-accepts-offer-to-return-with-place-in-quarantine-12530012;

The UK's biggest supermarket chain launched the Jack's brand - named after its founder Jack Cohen - in 2018 as part of a bid to learn how it could bring down costs and challenge the discounters Aldi and Lidl who had been taking market share for years.

But it said on Monday that six Jack's stores would now be converted to Tesco superstores, with the remaining seven sites to close in the coming months.

Tesco said that around 130 jobs would be affected, including some head office roles, but it hoped to find them new work within the business.

Image: The stores had 1,800 of their own brand range items

The seven sites listed for closure were:

• Hull

• St Helen's

• Walton

• Castle Bromwich

• Middlewich

• Barnsley

• Liverpool North

It was also confirmed by Tesco that meat, fish and deli counters at 317 store sites would be closed down due to changing customer demand.

However, that was not expected to lead to any redundancies as the staff hit would be offered alternative work. The chain said it currently had 3,000 vacancies in all.

Tesco said it would retain counter services at just 279 stores where custom had been maintained.

The company said it was making the changes to ""ensure we remain focused and competitive in a fast-changing market"".

Its boss in the UK and Ireland, Jason Tarry, said: ""We have learnt a huge amount from Jack's and this has helped Tesco become more competitive, more efficient and strengthened our value proposition, including through the launch of Aldi Price Match.

""In turn, this has enabled us to consistently attract new customers to Tesco from our competitors over the last two years and we know they increasingly recognise the value they can find at Tesco.

""With the learnings from Jack's now applied, the time is right to focus on ensuring we continue to deliver the best possible value for customers in our core business.""

Figures released earlier this month by Kantar Worldpanel showed Tesco had outperformed its major rivals over the 12 weeks to Boxing Day.

Instead the Metropolitan Police is investigating a dozen events over eight different dates. They have been handed more than 300 photos and more than 500 pieces of paper evidence. And the prime minister is entwined in it.

Four of those events being looked at by the Met were reportedly attended by the prime minister himself.

One of those events - which he denies took place - is an alleged party in his private Downing Street flat.

When it comes to what the PM potentially knew and when, the jury is still out, the evidence not in.

So Mr Johnson's refrain ""wait for Sue Gray"" has morphed into ""wait for the Met"".

He came to the House of Commons armed with an apology - ""I get it and I will fix it"" - and promised to improve his No 10 operation.

But the mood in the Commons was sulphurous, with none other than the former prime minister Theresa May leading the criticism.

On the face of it, the prime minister was bullish and in full strong-man mode.

But a hint of the pressure being applied behind the scenes by his party became all too clear when No 10 was bounced into committing to publish the Gray findings in full once the police investigation is complete.

The PM had repeatedly refused to give colleagues that undertaking in the Commons just hours earlier.

This a reminder that, for all the public show of strength, he is a leader still out of control of his parliamentary party.

He is also still vulnerable to events beyond his control.

The Metropolitan Police is now investigating what happened in No 10 on the back of evidence uncovered by the Gray report.

The prime minister repeatedly told the Commons no rules were broken in his No 10. Can he really square that circle?

And when the full findings come out, can he reassure enough of his MPs to avoid a confidence vote, and enough of the public to give him a second hearing as prime minister?

His allies believe he can ride out this storm, stressing that there is no mood in the parliamentary party to change leaders, and the PM needs time to put the No 10 operation back together and his premiership back on track.

They hope the public will lose interest and the scandal will peter out.

But there is no doubt that his is now a deeply-divided party, split over their leader and what should become of him.

As former justice secretary Robert Buckland told me on Monday night, the ""jury is still out"" and ""we haven't come to the end of the process"".

Former chief whip Mark Harper agreed - ""I don't think he's out of the woods at all"".

Ms Giuffre is suing the duke in her home country of the US, claiming she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, Andrew's friend and a convicted sex offender, to have sex with the royal when she was 17 - a minor under US law.

The duke is also alleged to have sexually abused Ms Giuffre during a visit to Epstein's private island, Little St James, and on a separate occasion at Epstein's Manhattan mansion.

Image: Virginia Giuffre pictured with lawyer David Boies in 2019

The duke has denied all of the allegations.

What are the main points in Prince Andrew's defence?

Earlier in January, it emerged that Ms Giuffre's lawyers requested help to get testimony from two potential witnesses in the UK, including the duke's former assistant Mr Olney.

Court documents revealed Judge Lewis A Kaplan wrote to the Senior Master of the Queen's Bench Division with the aim of having Mr Olney testify about the duke's communications with Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Ms Giuffre, and the duke's travel to Epstein's properties.

In a separate letter to the High Court, the judge also requested testimony from Shukri Walker - the second potential witness in the UK, who claims to have seen Andrew in Tramp nightclub in London.

Ms Walker's testimony should cover questions about the presence of the duke and Ms Giuffre at the nightclub in March 2001, and any interaction between the pair, the judge said.

Who's who in the Prince Andrew sex assault case?

Meanwhile, Judge Kaplan has also written to the Australian Attorney General requesting assistance in getting testimony from Ms Giuffre's husband Robert, and her psychologist Dr Judith Lightfoot.

The judge asked for Mr Giuffre's testimony to include how he met his wife, any discussions they had about Andrew, her alleged childhood trauma and abuse, and her relationship with Epstein and Maxwell.

The letter also requests testimony about the emotional and psychological harm Ms Giuffre says she has suffered, the Giuffre household finances, and her role in trafficking and recruiting young girls for Epstein.

The judge asked Dr Lightfoot to give evidence about Ms Giuffre's medical treatment, her diagnosis, childhood trauma, the theory of false memories, and her claims regarding Andrew.

The prime minister will hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv in a show of support for Ukraine as tensions on the country's border rise amid fears of an invasion by Mr Putin's forces.

Mr Johnson's visit will coincide with the UK announcing £88m of new funding for Ukraine to support stability there and help reduce its reliance on Russian energy supplies.

Mr Johnson said: ""It is the right of every Ukrainian to determine how they are governed. As a friend and a democratic partner, the UK will continue to uphold Ukraine's sovereignty in the face of those who seek to destroy it.

""We urge Russia to step back and engage in dialogue to find a diplomatic resolution and avoid further bloodshed.""

The PM said on Monday evening he still hopes to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to defuse the Ukraine crisis after a planned phone call between them was cancelled.

It comes after a tense meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday, a meeting which had been requested by the US to discuss Moscow's troop build-up.

Russia's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said US talk of war was ""provocative"", adding that there was ""no proof"" Moscow was planning military action in Ukraine.

But US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: ""The provocation is from Russia, not from us or other members of this council.""

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was meant to be accompanying Mr Johnson to Ukraine but on Monday night she said she tested positive for COVID-19 so will be staying behind.

She had earlier appeared without a face mask on the front bench in the House of Commons before announcing a strengthening of sanctions legislation that will give the UK the power to target any company or person linked to the Russian state.

Explainer: What's in the Sue Gray report and which Downing Street parties did she investigate?

Ukraine's president will surely question if Boris Johnson's focus is on Kyiv Deborah Haynes Security and Defence Editor @haynesdeborah Boris Johnson, on a flying visit to Kyiv, seems keen to take a leading role amongst Britain's allies in confronting Russia over Ukraine and threats to wider European security. His critics question whether he is seizing on this foreign crisis to deflect from mounting political woes at home. But there is no doubt that Ukraine's government needs and is hugely appreciative of any UK support given the threat it has faced from Moscow since the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the recent massing of more than 100,000 Russian troops near its borders. Still, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy surely will not be able to help but wonder whether his visitor has other things on his mind than the prospect of invading Russians. Mr Johnson had to delay a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday – a key element in what is meant to be a high-impact week of British diplomacy – because he was in the Commons fending off questions about parties during COVID lockdown In another blow, the prime minister will be travelling to Kyiv solo after his foreign secretary, Liz Truss, tested positive for coronavirus. However, despite all the – forced and unforced – distractions, the UK has still managed to fly out plane-loads of anti-tank weapons – some 2,000 in total – to Ukraine along with a team of around 30 specialist military trainers to teach the Ukrainian armed forces how to use the kit. Britain has also taken a prominent role in helping Ukraine's navy to rebuild after it was decimated by Russia's annexation of Crimea, where its headquarters were based. Outside Ukraine, the UK has pledged to send hundreds more troops to join a NATO deployment on the alliance's eastern flank if needed. That mission, established six years ago, is designed to deter any Russian attack on a NATO member rather than directly prevent a new offensive against Ukraine, which is not – yet at least – part of the transatlantic alliance. But NATO's 30 member states have yet to agree on any expansion of their footprint in the east, such as the Baltic States, and the Black Sea region in the southeast.

Sue Gray report overshadows PM's visit

Ms Truss then attended a packed meeting of Tory MPs where Mr Johnson was making his case to keep his job following the release of the Sue Gray report into lockdown parties at Downing Street and Whitehall.

The report was pared back due to the recently announced Metropolitan Police investigation into 12 out of 16 events in 2020 and 2021 while COVID restrictions were in place - including the PM's birthday celebration and a gathering in his Downing Street flat.

Behaviour surrounding the gatherings ""hard to justify""

Mr Johnson promised to make major changes to the way No 10 and the civil service is run after apologising and insisting: ""I get it and I will fix it"".

Despite Ms Gray's limited update on her investigation, she was still scathing about the culture and leadership that led to the events while the country was abiding by strict restrictions.

Opposition MPs used Mr Johnson's statement in the Commons to again call for his resignation, with Sir Keir Starmer accusing the PM of ""hiding behind a police investigation"" and the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford being escorted out of the Commons for refusing to withdraw accusations Mr Johnson lied to parliament.

Angela Richardson, Cabinet Minister Michael Gove's aide, announced on Monday afternoon she resigned from her role last week over the partygate scandal.

Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said if Mr Johnson fails to publish the Sue Gray report in full ""he will no longer have my support"".

And former PM Theresa May said her successor ""had not read the rules or didn't understand what they meant and others around him, or they didn't think the rules applied to Number 10"".

Conservative MP Aaron Bell said he was unable to hug his family after travelling hundreds of miles to go to his grandmother's funeral in 2020 and asked: ""Does the prime minister think I'm a fool?""

This beat the old record of 440.6 miles set in 2018.

Also in 2020, a single lightning flash over Uruguay and northern Argentina lasted 17.1 seconds. The previous record was 16.7 seconds.

Both regions are two of the few places in the world prone to the type of intense storms that can produce what are called ""megaflashes"", said Randall Cerveny of Arizona State University, head of records confirmation for the WMO.

Different coronavirus measures around the world will mean airlines are unable to move individually in allowing passengers to travel without coverings, sources have told The Times.

Other such travel rules are being eased by individual governments, with tests for fully vaccinated arrivals in England being scrapped from next Friday, 11 February.

But the newspaper reports that UK carriers are seeking ""international consistency"" before lifting the rule on masks, and will ""act as one"" when easing measures.

A senior aviation source said: ""Until there is a harmonised lifting of mask mandates on flights by governments worldwide it is simpler for airlines to keep the rules in place.""

Most British airlines are following guidelines from bodies including the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

The guidelines say that masks should be worn for the duration of flights, except when eating and drinking.

What are the airlines saying?

Virgin Atlantic told Sky News it adheres to guidance from international and local aviation regulators and governments and has no plans to lift the face mask measure yet.

""We continue to input to the regulators and work together across industry to see when changes can be made, however until further notice, we will require all customers and crew to continue to wear face masks for the duration of their flights, as well as at the airports,"" said a statement.

Neil Sorahan, Ryanair's chief financial officer, also said that there were no plans to change the rules.

He said: ""Masks will be something that will be with us for a while longer to come. If that is the price we have to pay for the next few months, into summer - it's a small price to pay.""

Mr Sorahan said the mask rule would remain in place, similar to how rules on passengers removing liquids from hand luggage at security have been kept over the years.

That measure was introduced in 2006, when police foiled a plot to blow up airliners using liquid explosives.

Another airline source told The Times: ""We'll almost certainly keep the same policy until it is safe to move. For example, the rules in the US are very clear on masks. It would be ridiculous of us to ask passengers to put them on when we enter their airspace.""

And another said that although there were ""hopes that one day we will have a world with no masks… they are going to be with us for a long time"".

Jack Sweeney, 19, turned down an initial offer of $5k to shut down the @ElonJet account, saying the payment wouldn't replace the satisfaction he received from running it.

The SpaceX and Tesla chief described the tracker, which uses publicly available air-traffic information, as a potential threat to his safety.

The University of Florida student described himself to Business Insider as a fan of Mr Musk and said he had created the bot as it ""would reveal what business is going on and where he is going"".

Mr Sweeney has launched similar accounts tracking the planes of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. The accounts state that they track the aircraft, not who may or may not be onboard.

The student also has a part-time job with a company called UberJets, which tracks chartered flights and allows its customers to identify cheap seats.

Student reveals messages from Musk

Mr Sweeney shared a direct message from Mr Musk, in which the tycoon said: ""Can you take this down? It is a security risk.""

""I don't love the idea of being shot by a nutcase,"" he adds.

Eventually, Mr Musk said: ""How about $5k for this account and generally helping make it harder for crazy people to track me?""

As this point, the teenager tried to upsell: ""Any chance to up that to $50k? It would be great support in college and would possibly allow me to get a car, maybe even a Model 3.""

The billionaire eventually declined, explaining it didn't feel right to pay to shut down the account, but Mr Sweeney said that advice he had shared about protecting the jet's identifying number appeared to have been adopted.

The teenager said he had made the correspondence public to try to reopen negotiations with Mr Musk, whether for an increase on the initial monetary offer or an internship.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201120841/http://news.sky.com/story/teenager-asks-elon-musk-for-50k-to-delete-twitter-account-tracking-the-billionaires-private-jet-12530130;

Some of the ""pork pie"" plotters are publicly recanting - one of them, Gary Sambrook, tweeting that he now supports the PM.

But even his allies concede that if the police find he personally broke the law, hand him a fixed penalty notice, or any damaging photos - after all 300 have been handed to the police - come to light, the mood could turn quickly.

The gathering in his flat, allegedly to celebrate the departure of Dominic Cummings on 13 November, which the PM and his wife have both denied, is the biggest cause of concern for his MPs.

Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News this morning that the prime minister is ""unfit for office"" and Tory MPs are ""debasing themselves"" by keeping him there.

Boris Johnson has seized on Sue Gray's suggestion that he will waste no time in overhauling his operation. He told MPs last night that would create panels of MPs to feed in policy ideas - promptly triggering calls from some in the room for him to reduce environmental taxes on energy bills, which the PM then defended.

Several MPs said the PM told colleagues to contact him with their ideas. He was saying ""WhatsApp me. You've got my number"", one said. ""I know I can be slow to reply... he's raised expectations very high"".

The PM also promised to bring in new people to No10 - although did not comment on the future of any of his current staff, and to take advice in some capacity from his old campaign manager Lynton Crosby.

The laboratory will continue operating until 2030 following a commitment made by President Biden and Vice President Harris last month, but its long-term future is unsustainable.

For more than 20 years, the ISS has been ""a beacon of peaceful international scientific collaboration,"" said NASA administrator Bill Nelson, but all of its mission goals will have been completed by the end of this decade.

International space station mission goals Enable deep space exploration

Conduct research to benefit humanity

Foster a US commercial space industry

Lead and enable international collaboration

Inspire humankind

NASA expects the future of space science collaboration to lie with commercially operated space platforms and has published a report about how it will be making this transition, including pulling the ISS out of the sky.

""While the ISS will not last forever, NASA expects to be able to operate it safely through 2030,"" the report states.

The agency has testified to Congress that it plans to purchase crew time for ""at least two - and possible more"" NASA astronauts aboard commercial space stations by the early 2030s. Several companies, including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, have plans to launch their own commercial orbiters.

Extending the life of the International Space Station to 2030 is intended to give private industry in the US the time to develop the capabilities needed to operate the microgravity platforms.

How will it de-orbit?

In the perfect scenario, the space station's orbiting altitude will be slowly lowered from its current altitude of 408km (253 miles).

As the altitude of the ISS drops it will encounter an ever-denser atmosphere, adding more drag and pulling it lower still.

The space station will still be travelling so fast that it will begin to heat and cast off debris in a path behind it.

The plan to avoid this debris damaging people or property is to have the ISS crash into an uninhabited area of the south Pacific Ocean, near to Point Nemo.

Point Nemo has been called a spacecraft cemetery because - as the point on the Earth most distant from any land - it is where decommissioned spacecraft are typically aimed when returning to the Earth.

But, of course, there are challenges. NASA warns that if there was higher solar activity this would expand the Earth's atmosphere and thus increase the resistance to the space station's velocity, making it slow and fall quicker - potentially meaning it misses its mark.

As the ISS approaches Point Nemo, its operators will fire its thrusters and those of several vehicles still attached to it for one last time to give it the final push into the sea.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201120841/http://news.sky.com/story/nasa-plans-to-take-international-space-station-out-of-orbit-in-january-2031-by-crashing-it-into-spacecraft-cemetery-12530194;

Grocery prices in the four weeks to 23 January rose by 3.8%, according to data company Kantar.

It adds to the cost of living surge facing households with consumer price inflation in December recorded at the highest level since 1992 and expected to climb further this spring as energy bills go up.

High fuel prices and the prospect of more interest rate rises are adding to the headache.

Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ""Prices are rising on many fronts, and the weekly shop is no exception.""

The latest grocery inflation rate recorded by Kantar was up from 3.5% in December.

It has not been higher since May 2020, when it was skewed by retailers scaling back promotions as they sought to discourage stockpiling in the early months of the pandemic.

""Taken over the course of a 12-month period, this 3.8% rise in prices could add an extra £180 to the average household's annual grocery bill,"" Mr McKevitt said.

""We're now likely to see shoppers striving to keep costs down by searching for cheaper products and promotions. Supermarkets that can offer the best value stand to win the biggest slice of spend.""

Image: Crisps were among the products to see price rises

Kantar said prices were rising fastest in products such as savoury snacks, fresh beef and crisps while falling in fresh bacon, vitamins and beer.

The industry data also showed a 3.8% fall in overall supermarket sales in the 12 weeks to 23 January compared with the same period a year ago, though they were 8% higher than pre-pandemic levels.

Kantar said it reflected the start of a return to shopping patterns that were normal before the pandemic as consumers go back to eating out and need to put less in their trolley on each trip.

The shift in habit was most noticeable in London, with take-home sales of food and drink down 11%.

Meanwhile online purchases were down 15% year-on-year, though at 12.5% of all grocery spending still represented twice the share of the market than before COVID-19 struck.

As for the daily deaths figure, this was 51 yesterday, giving a total of 155,754 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

Under-reporting

The number of new cases reported by the government has always been lower than the level estimated by the Office for National Statistics, but the gap has become wider since the arrival of the Omicron variant.

High levels of under-reporting will still be affecting the government's daily figures, meaning the true volume of cases in the UK is increasingly unclear.

The dashboard numbers are limited to all positive lab-confirmed PCR test results in the UK, plus positive lateral flow tests in Northern Ireland and, in England, any positive lateral flow tests not followed by a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours.

Although the dashboard will now also include figures for COVID-19 reinfections in England and Northern Ireland - this data will still be affected by how many people are reporting their test results.

The new study, compiled by 140 researchers in 100 countries, estimates the world to have 73,300 species, with 9,000 not even yet discovered.

But most undiscovered species are rare and live in tropical forests, which are being chipped away at by human activity or its consequences, including the climate crisis, deforestation and fires.

Despite our reliance on trees for things like regulating weather and providing food, timber, medicine and work, we still ""lack a fundamental understanding of how many species exist on our planet"", researchers said.

This knowledge would help us assess which systems can best cope with global change, which need conserving, or how future changes will impact ecosystems, they added.

The report is based on a database of more than 35 million trees in more than 100,000 sites around the world.

Researchers combined this data with statistical techniques to estimate the overall number of tree species.

South America is home to almost 17,000 species and an expected 40% of all undiscovered tree species.

The plane's right wing then lifts, leaving the jet moving along the runway at an angle with its left set of wheels on the ground.

Tuvalu's foreign minister Simon Kofe, who highlighted the threat of climate change to his low-lying Pacific Island nation by recording a speech for the United Nations climate conference standing knee-deep in seawater, has also been nominated.

Thousands of people, from members of parliaments worldwide to former winners, can propose candidates.

Attenborough, 95, whose TV nature programmes have won him worldwide acclaim, and Ms Tsikhanouskaya, who is in exile in Vilnius, are being backed by Norwegian lawmakers who have a track record of picking the winner.

Attenborough, best known for his landmark TV series illustrating the natural world, including Life on Earth and The Blue Planet, was nominated jointly with the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which assesses the state of biodiversity worldwide for policymakers.

They were chosen for ""their efforts to inform about, and protect, Earth's natural diversity, a prerequisite for sustainable and peaceful societies,"" said Norwegian Green Party leader, Une Bastholm.

'Brave, tireless and peaceful'

Ms Tsikhanouskaya was denied power by what Sky's Moscow correspondent Diana Magnay called ""a blatantly rigged election"" in August.

Norwegian parliamentarian Haarek Elvenes recognised her ""brave, tireless and peaceful work"" for democracy and freedom in her home country.

Pope Francis was nominated for his efforts to help solve the climate crisis as well as his work towards peace and reconciliation.

Mr Kofe was nominated by the leader of Norway's Liberal Party, Guri Melby, for his work in highlighting climate change issues.

The World Health Organisation, which has been at the forefront of the global response to the coronavirus pandemic, is nominated for the second year running.

Other nominees revealed

Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said the organisation is ""likely to be discussed in the Committee for this year's prize"".

Other nominees revealed by Norwegian lawmakers are the International Criminal Court in the Hague, WikiLeaks and Chelsea Manning, NATO, aid organisation CARE, Iranian human rights activist Masih Alinejad, and the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum for cooperation for Arctic nations, Reuters said.

The ONS said recent survey figures showed 66% of adults in Britain had experienced an increase in the cost of living over the past month, with higher energy bills cited as a cause by four in five.

Of those experiencing the cost of living rises, 32% said they were cutting back on their use of fuels such as gas and electricity, the ONS said.

Meanwhile, 53% were spending less on non-essentials and 26% were digging into their savings.

Energy bills rose sharply in October for millions of households when regulator Ofgem lifted the cap on standard tariffs charged by suppliers by 17.1% for gas and 8.7% for electricity.

They are set to see a further big increase in the spring with the expected announcement of a further increase in the cap after wholesale gas prices surged over recent months.

At the start of this year, they were on average four times higher than at the same period in 2021.

The ONS noted that before the January 2019 introduction of the price cap - a policy designed to protect consumers from unfairly high bills - fluctuations in the price of gas and electricity had been ""smaller and more frequent"".

Lower income households are likely to be hit disproportionately by energy price increases since they spend a higher proportion of their income on utility bills, the ONS said.

Former Scotland international Goodwillie joined Raith Rovers on a two-and-a-half-year deal from Clyde on transfer deadline day.

Goodwillie, who previously played for clubs including Dundee United, Blackburn Rovers and Aberdeen, was ruled to be a rapist in a civil court case in 2017, although no criminal proceedings were instructed.

He was ordered to pay £100,000 in damages by a judge after it was ruled he raped a woman in a flat in West Lothian in 2011. The Crown had previously decided not to prosecute Goodwillie due to insufficient evidence.

The striker, who has three Scotland caps, is currently the top scorer in the SPFL, having netted 15 times for Clyde so far this season.

McDermid was the shirt sponsor of Raith Rovers in 2014, and in 2010 the North Stand at Starks Park was renamed the McDermid Stand in honour of her father, who was a scout for the Kirkcaldy club.

She tweeted on Tuesday: ""I have this morning ended my lifelong support of @RaithRovers over their signing of the rapist David Goodwillie. I have cancelled next season's shirt sponsorship over this disgusting and despicable move. This shatters any claim to be a community or family club.

Since its release on to Disney+ on Christmas Eve, streaming of the film's soundtrack has soared, as fans get their fix of the Lin-Manuel Miranda-penned music.

And now, the tune We Don't Talk About Bruno from the film has landed at number one on the US Billboard 100 - giving Disney its first American chart-topper in almost two decades after knocking Adele's Easy On Me off the top spot.

The track, which also gives song-writing supremo Miranda his first ever US number one, follows the film's magical family as they try to avoid talking about their sibling Bruno, after a number of his prophecies came true.

As well as landing at the top of the US charts, it has also spent two weeks at number one on the UK's Top 40 charts, where it becomes Disney's first ever original chart-topper - and it has eyes on a third week.

Encanto quietly opened in cinemas in November 2021, but quickly shot to popularity once it was released online.

We Don't Talk About Bruno is only the fifth song by Disney, which is famous for its aminated musicals, to ever break into the US top five.

Aladdin's A Whole New World was the last track to hit number one in 1993, while Frozen's Let It Go (2013), Pocahontas' Colours Of The Wind (1995) and The Lion King's Can You Feel The Love Tonight (1994) round out the rest of the studio's top five tracks.

Surface Pressure, another track from the film, performed by Jessica Darrow, also appears in the UK and US top 10s, underlining the film's popularity on music streaming platforms.

In the lead role, the film stars Brooklyn Nine-Nine actress Stephanie Beatriz, who recently told Sky News, when talking about the film's co-writer and song-writer Lin-Manuel Miranda: ""I love him. He's amazing.

""I've known him since we were both like young, poor artists in New York. He's an incredible person, friend, collaborator, artist. I love his work and I think he's an amazing person.""

On Spotify, the world's biggest music streaming service, We Don't Talk About Bruno has notched up almost 102 million listens worldwide - but that is still some way behind the likes of Let It Go (517 million) and A Whole New World (209 million).

However, it was streamed in the US alone 39.5 million times last week, so it could soon surpass the other most popular tracks from the studio some time soon.

An investigation was launched after a complaint that an officer had sex with a drunk person in a police station, but it later uncovered much more.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct appealed for more evidence and other Metropolitan Police officers came forward with evidence of colleagues involved in bullying, violence towards women, perverting the course of justice and using discriminatory language.

WARNING - This article contains offensive language

The investigation centred largely on Charing Cross police station near Trafalgar Square in central London and led eventually to one officer being sacked and others being disciplined.

The watchdog's findings included:

• Police officers exchanged highly offensive racist, sexist and homophobic messages with claims that it was ""banter"" becoming a cover for bullying and harassment

• Messages about police officers attending a festival dressed as known sex offenders and a molested child were sent within a WhatsApp group containing 17 police officers

• Details of messages from WhatsApp groups and a Facebook chat group referring to rape including ""I would happily rape you"" and ""if I was single I would happily chloroform you""

• One police officer was referred to as ""mcrapey raperson"" in a WhatsApp exchange. When officers on his team were asked to provide an explanation for this nickname, one explanation given was that there were rumours about him bringing a woman back to the police station to have sex with

• Evidence of racism including a number of messages with references to African children, Somali people and Auschwitz

• Homophobic language used by officers including one entry that said ""f*** you bender""

• Use of derogatory terms about people with disabilities

• WhatsApp messages about domestic violence, plus sexually explicit, misogynistic and demeaning conversations

• Female officers who challenged sexual harassment were told it was part of police culture, that they should accept, ""play the game or stay quiet"", or leave

• Police officers on probation were intimidated and threats made to cut their hair and belongings

Dismissed as 'banter'

The IOPC's regional director Sal Naseem said: ""The behaviour we uncovered was disgraceful and fell well below the standards expected of the officers involved.

""While these officers predominantly worked in teams in Westminster, which have since been disbanded, we know from other recent cases that these issues are not isolated or historic.""

Investigators reviewed thousands of messages exchanged by officers, many of which it described as highly sexualised, discriminatory or referring to violence. When questioned, officers dismissed the messaging as banter.

Image: One officer has been sacked and others have been disciplined. File pic

Mr Naseem said: ""Our investigation showed the officers' use of 'banter' became a cover for bullying and harassment. Colleagues were afraid to speak out about these behaviours for fear of being ostracised, demeaned or told to get another job.

""We are grateful to those officers who were brave enough to speak to us about the cultural issues that existed within these teams, realising that in doing so they risked further bullying. This took courage.

""Hopefully our learning report and recommendations will give officers the confidence to come forward in the knowledge that people are listening and that changes will be made.""

'I read their messages with disgust and shame'

Of 14 officers investigated, two were fired for gross misconduct and put on a barred list to stop them ever working again for the police. Two officers resigned and two others were disciplined.

The Metropolitan Police apologised and said the officers' conduct did not represent the values of the force. It acknowledged it would have damaged trust and confidence in the Met.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid said: ""I am angry and disappointed to see officers involved in sharing sexist, racist and discriminatory messages. It's clear we have a lot of work to do to ensure bullying and discrimination does not exist in any part of the Met.""

Commenting on the watchdog's findings, Priti Patel said: ""Being a police officer is a privilege which has been abused by these sickening officers.""

The Home Secretary said she expected the force and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to implement the report's recommendations ""as soon as practically possible"".

'Damage public trust in the police'

The IOPC made 15 recommendations to ""seek to tackle underlying cultural issues"" and urged the Met to ""publicly commit to being an anti-racist organisation with a zero-tolerance policy towards sexism, misogyny, bullying and harassment"".

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""I am utterly disgusted by the behaviour outlined in this IOPC report, which details the shocking evidence of discrimination, misogyny, harassment and bullying by police officers. The conduct of these officers was totally unacceptable and what has been revealed by these investigations will only further damage public trust and confidence in the police.""

It's easy to forget this conflict has been going since 2014. It's now just part of life for those who have stayed behind.

But the scars of the fighting litter the landscape, destroyed and abandoned homes are everywhere.

These towns and villages are sometimes completely abandoned, but the ones that are not are very quiet.

We're in the town of Krymske, in Luhansk region, and apart from the movement of soldiers most of the streets are empty. The conflict and COVID-19 are a double whammy to life here.

""It's terrible. War is war. What can I say? If they shoot grads [rockets] for the whole week, what do you think that is like for us?""

The defensive trenches in this part of eastern Ukraine are essentially overwatch positions to keep an eye on the movements of Russian-backed separatists - and more importantly any invasion by the Russian army.

Conditions in the trenches here in Krymske are miserable and dangerous. The soldiers say in recent weeks there's been more activity and more firing from the other side, especially at night.

Peering through his camouflaged viewing hatch, Artur Vlasov explained that the separatists are never far away.

""We can see their movements because it's a short distance... They walk, they rotate. In Russian military uniform, well, in the same green uniform.""

There's a real sense that this freezing frontline is frozen - waiting for some sort of breakthrough that could relieve the tension.

Image: Most of the streets are empty except for the movement of soldiers

As diplomatic moves and meetings among leaders take place both in Ukraine and abroad, the fact is the two sides are stuck between the battle lines already drawn.

For the soldiers who fight here, and people who live here, there's nothing to suggest this will change.

We stopped at a checkpoint to ask the soldier on duty if he'd be willing to speak us.

Our local producer Azad Safarov introduced me by name, and the soldier replied: ""I know him, we met in Afghanistan in 2008, you were there, right?""

Then he turned to Azad and explained I was filming with his unit back then at a military base.

To be honest I've met hundreds of soldiers through the years, and when they're in their uniforms it's sometimes difficult to distinguish between them.

The 110-minute film, titled The Great Year Of Victory, 2021 and aired on KRT, showcased the North Korean leader's successes in missile development, construction, and efforts to beat the pandemic.

At one point, the leader of the secretive country is seen slowly descending a set of steps, followed by a group of officials, during a visit to a rainy construction site.

A notably slim Kim is carrying an umbrella and appears to be struggling somewhat, but the narration is classically sycophantic.

""Kim Jong Un,"" the narrator said, ""showed us his fatherly side by doggedly braving snow, rain, and wind while taking on the fate of the nation.

""He treated people like his own children, showing his motherly side, where he completely dedicated his own body to realise people's dreams.""

Image: It was all a bit too much for some of the delegates

This has been seen as a possible reference to the dictator's recent weight loss.

The film also includes much of the content observers have come to expect from such efforts.

He is seen talking at various meetings, addressing a conference of rapt officials (some in tears) and meeting people at various locations.

Military might

As usual, North Korea's military prowess features, with tanks, artillery, parading, cheering troops and countless missiles on show, some of which are seen being launched.

Image: A drone waters crops

Jets and helicopters, trailing coloured smoke and fireworks, criss-cross the sky.

Kim is also seen on a horse, first on a beach in the opening shot and later galloping through a forest.

It should be noted, however, that he is filmed from behind in the first scene, filmed at sunrise, so it is impossible to be certain it is him.

The film shows a drone watering crops and swooping shots of a new residential development, images which contrast sharply with the hardships faced by North Koreans.

Increasing food shortages accelerated by Western sanctions brought in to deter its missile programmes, drought, and floods are some of the issues, UN agencies have said.

Niall Burgess, who was secretary general of the department of foreign affairs (DFA) at the time, tweeted a selfie on 17 June 2020 showing a group of officials in the department's Iveagh House headquarters celebrating Ireland's election to the UN Security Council.

The picture - captioned ""now we're walking on air…"" - showed a tightly-gathered group of around 20 people, with champagne bottles and glasses visible, but was deleted a short time later.

What were Ireland's rules at the time - and how were they broken?

Ireland's lockdown rules meant indoor gatherings of more than six people were banned.

People were urged to work from home where possible, and physical distancing and face mask guidance was in place.

An internal DFA report into the event, published last night, found a ""serious breach"" of social distancing rules had occurred at the gathering, which ""caused offence, inflicted reputational damage on the Department and undermined internal morale"".

The report stated that Mr Burgess was found to be ""largely responsible for facilitating the breach of social distance guidance that occurred"".

It recommended that he pay €2,000 (£1,670) to a charity providing assistance to people affected by COVID, and that the three other senior officials visible in the photograph donate €1,000 (£835).

All have agreed to do so, and the report added that no further action would be taken.

The review also concluded that the event was not organised or pre-planned, and that the staff gathered at Iveagh House were ""conducting essential business"".

What's the reaction been?

The minister for foreign affairs, Simon Coveney, said the report was ""fair and balanced"", and described the gathering as a moment of careless celebration that only lasted for around a minute.

But Sinn Fein has called for an independent investigation.

The party's finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty said that ""there is no accountability in this report, and an internal investigation was never going to provide it"".

""It is clear that an independent investigation is the only way to get to the bottom of this,"" he said.

""Sinn Fein have already communicated this to the Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin] in a letter last week.

English star Stephenson Ardern-Sodje, who plays Simba, said that they ""were subjected to racial and homophobic abuse, both verbally and with the threat of violence, while on the way home after the show in Dublin"".

Speaking on social media, Mr Ardern-Sodje said that ""it was a huge blow that hit us hard as a company, opening old wounds for many"".

He added: ""This isn't the first time many of us have experienced something like this, and it's unlikely to be the last, but in these darker moments it's good to be reminded 'that the night must end and that the sun will rise'.""

Another British actor, Rushand Chambers, posted: ""It's just upsetting, all the work, time and energy we've given to then be subjected to behaviour like this.""

""Dublin has been a good experience as well I want to make that clear,"" Mr Chambers added. ""The theatre and audience are beautiful! But we can't ignore the ugly side too. The country needs healing, it's just not our job to do so.""

Fellow cast member Melvin Le Blanc added: ""This needs to stop!!""

What is understood to have happened?

Irish police told Sky News that they were investigating an incident that took place last Friday, 28 January, at Hanover Street East in Dublin.

The street is a very short distance from the Bord Gais Energy Theatre, where The Lion King has been running for the past month.

It's understood that shortly before 11pm, a number of the production's members were subjected to verbal abuse from a group of male youths, after leaving the theatre.

Gardai say no arrests have yet been made, and anyone with any information is asked to contact Pearse Street Garda Station.

In a statement, the theatre said: ""We are saddened to share that several of the performers and crew of The Lion King, currently performing at Bord Gais Energy Theatre in Dublin, were recently subjected to racial abuse on their way home from the theatre.

""It is shocking that something so vile and appalling happened to our colleagues who have brought such joy to thousands of theatregoers since the show opened on 31 December.

""We fully stand with the performers and crew and have put plans in place to support those affected by this incident. We also urge that those responsible be held accountable and have reported this incident to An Garda Siochana.""

Members of the production, which runs in Dublin until Friday, are from the UK, South Africa and France, as well as Ireland.

Speaking at a news conference alongside Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, the prime minister said: ""It goes without saying that a further Russian invasion of Ukraine would be a political and humanitarian disaster... it would be a military disaster as well.""

He warned that a ""package of sanctions and other measures"" is being prepared to be enacted when the ""first Russian toecap crosses into Ukrainian territory"".

Mr Johnson said: ""It is vital that Russia steps back and chooses a path of diplomacy and I believe that is still possible.""

He went on to say Russian troops on Ukraine's border are a ""clear and present danger"" and accused Russia's President Vladimir Putin of trying to redraw the security map of Europe.

Russia has placed more than 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine.

But President Putin has denied he is planning an attack on its neighbour.

Mr Johnson is due to have a phone call with the Russian president tomorrow.

In an earlier news conference, President Putin accused the West of ignoring Russia's security proposals and said its main security demands have not been satisfied.

But he went on to say that he wants to avoid negative scenarios and that a way needs to be found to protect everyone's security.

When asked on Tuesday morning if any fixed penalty notices would be made public as part of the Metropolitan Police's investigation into the partygate scandal, the prime minister's spokesman said it was for the Met to decide whether to reveal who has been fined.

But hours later, after being asked again, he said: ""As the Met have made clear, generally speaking with Fixed Penalty Notice, individuals are not published in any way. Obviously, we are aware of the significant public interest regarding the prime minister, and would always look to provide what updates we can on him specifically.""

Asked if that meant No 10 would reveal if Mr Johnson was given a fixed penalty notice, the spokesman said: ""Hypothetically, yes.""

No 10 indicated it may not reveal the names of other officials and MPs if they are fined after the Met pointed to College of Policing guidance that says the names of people handed fixed penalty notices, the likely punishment for breaching COVID regulations, would not normally be revealed.

Conservative MP hands in letter of no confidence

The U-turn comes as another Tory MP has handed in a letter of no confidence in Mr Johnson.

Peter Aldous, MP for Waveney in Suffolk, said he has written to Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, advising him he has no confidence in Mr Johnson as leader of the Conservative Party.

""After a great deal of soul-searching, I have reached the conclusion that the prime minister should resign,"" he wrote.

""It is clear that he has no intention of doing so.

""I have never taken such action before and had hoped that I would not be put in such an invidious position.""

Mr Aldous, who has been an MP since 2010, is among a handful of Tory MPs who are understood to have handed in letters of no confidence following the lockdown events in Downing Street and Whitehall - with 54 letters needed to trigger a leadership vote.

Number 10's latest comments come after the release of a partial version of Sue Gray's report into Downing Street gatherings during COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 and 2021.

Facing MPs in the Commons on Monday, Mr Johnson apologised and promised a shake-up of Number 10, insisting: ""I get it and I will fix it.""

The Met Police is investigating 12 gatherings, including an event that happened at the Downing Street flat on 13 November 2020 and an event to mark the PM's birthday on 19 June 2020.

The force said on Monday that it has received more than 300 photos and 500 pieces of paper as part of its inquiries.

'Taken for mugs'

Downing Street has said Mr Johnson will ask Ms Gray to ""update her work"" once the Metropolitan Police's investigation is finished and ""he will publish that update"".

Speaking to Sky News earlier on Monday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said people who followed COVID rules ""will feel like they've been taken for mugs"" by the PM.

Sir Keir said Mr Johnson is ""debasing the office"" of PM and has ""got to go"" in the wake of the release of a partial version of the Gray report, which he described as being as ""damning as it could be"".

Also speaking to Burley, deputy PM Dominic Raab claimed Mr Johnson cannot answer specific questions about lockdown parties in Downing Street because he does not want to prejudice the police investigation.

""If he does start answering specific questions that have been referred to the police, he will be accused, in fact fairly and rightly, of prejudicing or preventing or interfering in that investigation,"" Mr Raab said.

""He is considered a vital witness to our investigation and will be offered support from professionals to help him come to terms with the terrifying situation he was confronted with.""

Driver had pleaded with police to de-arrest him

Abraham had been arrested on suspicion of murder but was later released on bail until late February.

Last week he pleaded with the police to de-arrest him saying he ""just wanted to stop him hurting anybody further"" and it was ""never my intention to harm"" McCaskre.

McCaskre ambushed his 43-year-old ex-partner Chkaifi and repeatedly stabbed her in Maida Vale, west London, on 24 January.

Several witnesses tried unsuccessfully to stop the knifeman, before the driver ran him over in a blue Renault Clio.

McCaskre died at the scene on Chippenham Road and Chkaifi was also pronounced dead after the attack.

Abraham said his car stalled after McCaskre went under it, and he and other members of the public attempted to free him so they could give him first aid but they were unsuccessful.

Thousands signed a petition calling for him not to face criminal charges.

That compares to 92,368 cases on Monday - a sharp rise on Sunday's figure because reinfections in England and Northern Ireland were included for the first time.

Data for Scotland and Wales will be added in the ""days ahead"", the government website said.

A further 219 coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded in the UK - compared to 51 announced on Monday.

A reinfection is defined as someone who tests positive for COVID-19 more than 90 days after a previous infection.

Any positive tests within 90 days are said to be part of the same ""infection episode"".

The arrival of the Omicron variant has made a difference, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said.

Reinfection rates averaged around 1.4% of cases until 16 November 2021, when a ""spike in infections took place following the emergence of Omicron"", the UKHSA commented.

""Following that increase in the number of people infected, reinfections rose - with reinfections now representing around 10% of episodes per day.""

Professor Steven Riley, the UKHSA's director general of data and analytics, said: ""Reinfection remained at very low levels until the start of the Omicron wave. It is right that our daily reporting processes reflect how the virus has changed.""

A total of 37,342,083 people have now had a third or booster vaccine - equivalent to 64.9% of the population aged 12 and over.

Elsewhere, many countries have not reached their Omicron infection peak, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said.

Its technical lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, said measures to curb the variant's spread should be eased slowly.

The WHO's emergencies chief, Mike Ryan, has urged countries to chart their own path out of the pandemic and not blindly follow others in relaxing measures.

""If you open doors quickly you better be able to close them pretty quickly as well,"" he said.

And powerful immunity T cells - which are thought to play a role in long-term protection from serious COVID - are able to recognise Omicron, a study from the University of Cape Town in South Africa has found.

Breivik killed eight people with a car bomb in Oslo before gunning down 69 people, most of them teenagers, at a Labour Party youth camp in July 2011.

Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) figures show huge amounts were wasted on useless equipment, while millions of pounds has been spent getting out of contracts or storing PPE at ports.

Some £673m worth of equipment was found to be totally unusable, according the 2020/21 accounts, while £750m was spent on items that expired before being used.

COVID-19: The latest from the UK and across the world

Nearly £2.6bn was spent on ""items not suitable for use in the NHS"", but which the department thinks can be sold or given to charities.

The DHSC also said the value of its remaining stock had been slashed by £4.7bn as the price of PPE dropped.

Equipment that was scheduled to be delivered after the end of the financial year will lose £1.2bn in value, the figures show.

The £8.7bn total also includes £111.5m for not moving containers full of PPE from a port to their storage facility on time.

No 10 said: ""We stand by the decision to purchase the items that we did. We were acting in a highly competitive global market with many countries imposing export bans and obviously we were seeking to secure PPE for frontline clinicians.""

At the start of the pandemic, prices for protective equipment rose sharply as countries clamoured to get hold of items such as face masks.

The closure of schools led to a loss of around £1.25m as the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme (SFVS) was temporarily suspended.

Almost £250,000 of produce has been donated to food charities, the DHSC said.

Some of the ventilators ministers ordered ""did not fully meet functionality requirements at the time"", incurring costs of £1.1m.

Officials wrote off laboratory equipment valued at £663,000 after two regional testing sites were closed and ""there being no alternative options for repurposing or storing these assets"".

Additionally, a stockpile of intensive care unit items was created to prevent shortages.

The department was forced to pay out £649,000 for two flights from China that were cancelled because the PPE they were meant to be bringing to the UK was not available.

Another cancellation fee, this time of £339,000, was incurred following the cancellation of two contracts for quarantine hotels.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201180834/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-nearly-9bn-spent-on-ppe-during-coronavirus-pandemic-written-off-accounts-show-12530502;

The former actor and comedian, 84, was released last June after nearly three years in prison.

His conviction was overturned by Pennsylvania's Appeals Court, which found Cosby thought he had a non-prosecution agreement with a former district attorney when he gave damaging testimony in his accuser's 2005 lawsuit.

However, the testimony he gave in light of the deal eventually led to his arrest in 2015.

Cosby was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, who waived her anonymity, in 2018 and vowed to serve all 10 years of his sentence rather than acknowledge any remorse.

On Monday, in a 15-page response, Cosby lawyer Jennifer Bonjean strongly rejected the recent attempt to revive his criminal case, claiming it was ""unjustified"".

The bid to review the case, which has been brought by District Attorney Kevin Steele, is something of a long shot.

Just one percent of petitions are accepted by the US Supreme Court.

However, Mr Steele believes there is a chance. The non-prosecution promise is only alluded to in a 2005 news release from the district attorney at the time, who said there was not enough evidence to arrest Cosby.

Mr Steele does not think that amounts to an immunity agreement.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201180834/http://news.sky.com/story/bill-cosbys-lawyers-ask-us-supreme-court-not-to-revive-sexual-assault-case-12530235;

The operation was launched after female students in the city reported the behaviour of some drivers which ""made them feel threatened and unsafe"".

Police decided to crackdown on the problem by sending undercover officers to some of the areas identified by the students.

""Women should feel safe to walk our streets""

They say the ""harassment of women and girls in any way is unacceptable"" - and released an image of one driver having his details taken by officers after they were caught ""making comments by officers which were classed as causing alarm and distress"".

It comes amid an ongoing movement to end violence and harassment against women, with a number of Reclaim These Streets protests and vigils having taken place across the UK over the last year.

Detective Superintendent Tanya Wilkins of Bradford District Police told Sky News: ""Bradford Police take all reports of violence against women and related offences such as harassment very seriously, and believes women should feel safe to walk our streets.

""Before Christmas officers were made aware of concerns expressed by female students of the behaviour of some drivers in the city which made them feel threatened and unsafe including harassment and harassing comments made against them.

""As many of these reports were third-hand only, plain clothes female officers have been conducting patrols in identified student areas to gain a better understanding of any problems and build an intelligence picture of what is taking place.

""In a recent operation a driver was spotted making comments by officers which were classed as causing alarm and distress under the Public Space Protection Order in place in the city, and a report has been made.""

She said uniformed patrols would also continue in affected areas.

""Harassment of women and girls in any way is unacceptable and we will look to utilise any necessary Police and Partnership powers to positively tackle any issues identified at an early stage,"" she added.

The Reclaim These Streets movement, which rose to prominence following the murder of Sarah Everard, aims to highlight ""street harassment of women and girls"", ""educate boys and men to take responsibility for the problem of violence against women and girls"" and work ""to challenge misogyny in the way our laws are written and enforced"".

""Streets should be safe for women regardless of what we wear, where we walk or what time of day or night it is,"" the group says.

Brady, a former The Apprentice and Celebrity Big Brother star, compared the MailOnline columnist and GB News presenter to convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein during an online campaign lasting more than two months in 2021, Sheffield Crown Court heard during a hearing on Tuesday.

Brady also accused Mr Wootton, the former executive editor of The Sun, of being a sex offender and a murderer and posted an explicit picture of himself and invited Mr Wootton to engage in sexual activity, the court was told.

The 31-year-old will be sentenced on Friday and faces up to six months in prison after pleading guilty to one count of harassment. He was remanded in custody following Tuesday's hearing.

He had originally been due to go on trial in 2021 but proceedings were delayed due to legal problems, the court heard.

On Monday, he agreed to plead guilty to a less serious charge.

Laura Marshall, prosecuting, said that Mr Wootton had been consulted about this and said he ""simply wants the course of conduct to end"".

The prosecution's case was not opened and details of the offences were not given in court. However, the charge was outlined by the clerk, who said Brady's harassment of Mr Wootton took place between 13 February and 28 April 2021 and included using WhatsApp, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, online blogs and YouTube to cause the journalist ""alarm and distress"".

Flack had died a year earlier, on 15 February 2020. She had been in a relationship with Brady and they were engaged briefly in 2018.

Brady had been remanded in custody in mid-December after a judge expressed concerns about his behaviour towards camera crews and photographers outside court and other actions inside the courtroom.

Judge Jeremy Richardson told Brady on Tuesday: ""I am pleased that this case has, at last, been resolved...

""As I have made clear already, the desire of everybody in this case, including myself, is for you to stop doing what you did. You must move on with your life, it is to be hoped, to sunnier uplands.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201180834/http://news.sky.com/story/caroline-flacks-ex-fiance-andrew-brady-pleads-guilty-to-harassing-mailonline-and-gb-news-journalist-dan-wootton-12530404;

Analysis of the business completed by the 20 clubs showed £295m was spent in total - up from £70m in 2021.

Deloitte's Sports Business Group said it was the second-highest total since 2003, with the bottom five teams accounting for more than 50% of the expenditure as they battle to avoid relegation.

Net spend, player purchases minus player sales, came in at £180m - the highest on record.

Liverpool made the made expensive purchase of the window, as Luis Diaz joined the 2019/20 champions from Porto for an initial £37.5m (potentially rising to £49m).

Newcastle United's new Saudi-led consortium splashed the cash on deals including Bruno Guimaraes - for £35m from Lyon (rising to £40m) - and Chris Wood from Burnley for £25m. The club spent a league-high of £85m in total.

Deloitte said that Premier League spending accounted for nearly 50% of gross expenditure across Europe's ""big five"" leagues (the top divisions in England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy).

Dan Jones, head of the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: ""This transfer window indicates the financial pressures of COVID on Premier League clubs are easing, with spending firmly back to pre-pandemic levels and remarkably among the highest we've ever seen in January.

""The Premier League continues to lead the way globally, retaining its status as the world's biggest domestic football league in financial terms, again supported by full stadia and securing strong overseas broadcast deals.

""Other large European leagues are also edging back to higher spending, but it is Premier League clubs that have notched up the largest total spend in this transfer window, spending almost 150 million pounds more than Serie A clubs, the closest competitor.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201180834/http://news.sky.com/story/premier-league-january-transfer-window-spending-back-at-pre-pandemic-levels-12530449;

Richard Scorer, head of abuse and public inquiries at Slater and Gordon, added: ""I echo the widespread disgust at what we saw and heard in the House of Commons yesterday as Boris Johnson tried to distract from the Sue Gray update.

""As one of the lawyers who represented many of Savile's victims, I can confirm that these allegations against Sir Keir Starmer are completely unfounded and unjustified.

""Sir Keir did more than any other director of public prosecutions to advance the rights of victims.

""No DPP can control every decision. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was much better under his leadership.

""Weaponising their suffering to get out of a political hole is disgraceful.""

Sir Keir: 'It's obviously not true'

Sir Keir told Sky News on Tuesday it is a ""ridiculous slur peddled by right-wing trolls"" and he could see the ""disgust"" on the faces of Conservative MPs behind Mr Johnson as he made the accusation.

""They knew that he was going so low with that slur, with that lie - he had been advised not to do it because it's obviously not true, but he does it because he doesn't understand what honesty and integrity means,"" Sir Keir said.

Image: Sir Keir Starmer denied the accusation in the Commons

Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he was ""far from satisfied that the comments in question were appropriate"" but said ""procedurally nothing disorderly occurred"".

Downing Street said Mr Johnson stands by his comments but his official spokesman refused to repeat the assertion, arguing that it would clash with the principle of civil service impartiality.

However some Tory MPs spoke out against the comments, including former chief whip Julian Smith, who said the ""smear"" against Sir Keir ""is wrong and cannot be defended, it should be withdrawn"".

Fact check

In 2020, fact-checking charity Full Fact looked into the claim Sir Keir had stopped Savile being charged in 2009, when Sir Keir was head of the CPS.

It said the decision not to prosecute Savile was made on the grounds of ""insufficient evidence"", with the allegations against the DJ dealt with by local police and a reviewing lawyer for the CPS.

""A later investigation criticised the actions of both the CPS and the police in their handling of the situation,"" Full Fact found.

""It did not suggest that Mr Starmer was personally involved in the decisions made.""

A Chinese manufacturer made 10,800 tea cups, mugs and plates to mark the Queen's 70-year reign.

The only problem was the inscription.

Wholesale Clearance UK, which sells unwanted stock in bulk, has picked up the collection.

It comments on its website: ""You will notice this is probably more at home on the shelf next to Peckham Spring (Del Boy's bottled water which glowed yellow in the dark) as these are in fact celebrating the Queen's Platinum Jubbly.

""These are... as you say... the Creme de la Menthe! So if you are a fan of the Queen and Del Boy... two birds with one stone.""

Andy White, from the company based in Poole, Dorset, said it was a ""bit of fun"".
