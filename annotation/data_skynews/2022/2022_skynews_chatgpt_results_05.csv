A limited version of the Cabinet Office inquiry by top civil servant Ms Gray has been made public after weeks of delay.

The 12-page document, which was pared back due to the Met Police investigating some of the gatherings, is likely to prove pivotal in determining the prime minister's future as he faces anger over the partygate scandal.

Boris Johnson apologised to the Commons and promised a shake-up of No 10, insisting: ""I get it and I will fix it.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:16 Sue Gray report: Key points

Key points in the version of the Gray report include:

• 16 events in 2020 and 2021 were investigated - the Met Police are looking into 12 of them

• Some of the behaviour surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify

• A number of the gatherings should not have been allowed to take place or to develop in the way that they did

• At least some gatherings represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of government but also of the standards expected of the entire population

• There were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office

• The garden at 10 Downing Street was also used for gatherings without clear authorisation or oversight. This was not appropriate

• Some staff wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work but at times felt unable to do so

• Steps must be taken to ensure every government department has a ""clear and robust"" policy over excessive alcohol consumption in the workplace - which is ""not appropriate""

Explainer: What's in the Sue Gray report and which Downing Street parties did she investigate?

Analysis: The hidden meanings behind Sue Gray findings

Analysis: Slight reprieve for Boris Johnson but Sue Gray clear full report needs to be published Beth Rigby Political editor @BethRigby Sue Gray's conclusion is clear in its criticism, and there is no getting away from it being bad for Boris Johnson, but it is also partial. As far as opposition sources are concerned the key line is on page five, where Sue Gray says it has not been possible to provide a ""meaningful report"" due to the limitations created by the ongoing Met police investigation. So when Sue Gray references the fact she has gathered significant evidence from 70 witnesses and concludes serious failures having been made, it puts the prime minister under huge pressure to commit to releasing the full document when the police investigation concludes. The prime minister is now going to have to go to parliament and explain all of this away. The partial nature of the report may have given him a slight reprieve, but Sue Gray has made clear there is a full picture waiting to be revealed to the British people. The opposition, and some in his own party, will want a commitment that will happen.

No 'meaningful report' at this stage

Last week, the Met Police launched a criminal investigation into potential breaches of COVID regulations in Downing Street and Whitehall and requested Ms Gray's report make only ""minimal reference"" to events it is looking at.

The 12 gatherings being looked into by the Met include an event that happened at the Downing Street flat on 13 November 2020, the night aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain left their Number 10 roles, and an event to mark the PM's birthday on 19 June 2020.

The Met Police revealed on Monday afternoon officers are reviewing ""at pace"" more than 300 images and 500 pages of information handed over by the Cabinet Office on Friday.

They said officers are now confirming which individuals need to be contacted for their account and will be issued with a fixed penalty notice if police deem them to have breached COVID regulations - which they can dispute in a magistrates' court.

Ms Gray said the police investigation means she is ""extremely limited in what I can say"" so it is ""not possible at present to provide a meaningful report"" setting out all she has discovered

She said she has opted not to publish factual accounts of events not under investigation by police because to do so would damage her overall findings.

A No 10 spokesman said after the Met's investigation is complete, the PM will ask Ms Gray to update her work ""in light of what is found"" and that will be published.

PM apologises

Addressing MPs in the Commons, Mr Johnson said: ""I want to say sorry - and I'm sorry for the things we simply didn't get right and also sorry for the way this matter has been handled.

""It's no use saying this or that was within the rules and it's no use saying people were working hard. This pandemic was hard for everyone.""

Mr Johnson told MPs he was making changes to the way Downing Street and the Cabinet Office are run ""so that we can get on with the job that I was elected to do and the job that this government was elected to do"".

""First it is time to sort out what Sue Gray rightly calls the fragmented and complicated leadership structures of Downing Street which she says have not evolved sufficiently to meet the demands of the expansion of Number 10 and we will do that, including by creating an office of the prime minister with a permanent secretary to lead Number 10,"" he said.

Finishing his statement, the PM said: ""I get it, and I will fix it. I want to say to the people of this country I know what the issue is.

""It is whether this government can be trusted to deliver, and I say 'yes we can be trusted to deliver'.""

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The prime minister must keep his promise to publish Sue Gray's report in full when it is available, but it is already clear what the report disclosed is the most damning conclusion possible.""

Mr Johnson reacted to Sir Keir by accusing him of failing to prosecute notorious sex offender Jimmy Savile while he was director of public prosecution, prompting Nazif Afzal, a former chief Crown prosecutor, to call the PM a ""disgrace"".

Tory MPs decide if they are supporting PM or not

The PM has come under increasing pressure to resign over the partygate revelations following the report's release.

Some of his backbenchers have already called for Mr Johnson to go, while a number of others have said they were waiting for the release of the Gray report before deciding whether to send a letter to the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs demanding a contest.

Former cabinet minister and vice-chair of the Conservative Party Andrew Mitchell told the Commons the PM no longer has his backing.

Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said if Mr Johnson fails to publish the Sue Gray report in full ""he will no longer have my support"".

And former PM Theresa May said the report demonstrates that No 10 ""was not observing the regulations they had imposed on members of the public"".

She said this means her successor ""had not read the rules or didn't understand what they meant and others around him, or they didn't think the rules applied to Number 10"".

The prime minister said: ""My view on NHS workers, everybody involved in looking after vulnerable people, all healthcare professionals should get a vaccine. That's absolutely clear.""

There were concerns that the sector could be left with a massive staffing crisis due to the number of workers choosing not to be vaccinated.

Liz Truss said it means a much broader range of oligarchs and businesses could be sanctioned because of their significance to the Kremlin.

Until now, the UK was only able to sanction those linked to the destabilisation of Ukraine.

'Nothing is off the table'

""Whether you support Russia's aggressive actions against Ukraine, or you're of wider significance to the Kremlin, we will have the power to sanction you,"" Ms Truss said.

""Nothing is off the table and there will be nowhere to hide.

""This will amount to the toughest sanctions regime against Russia we have had in place yet, and mark the biggest change in our approach since leaving the European Union.""

Britain has so far imposed sanctions on around 180 people and 48 entities such Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014.

The prime minister's official spokesperson said: ""The Russian elite should be in no doubt that we have significant powers and will take them further, which will place massive pressure on them should they continue on this path of aggression.""

Kremlin says sanctions will backfire

It comes after the Kremlin said the UK's threats to impose economic sanctions were alarming and warned such actions would backfire by hurting British companies.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the threat was an attack on Russian businesses. He said it undermined Britain's investment climate and inflamed tensions in Europe.

Mr Peskov told a briefing that Russia will respond to any such action in a way that would be based on its interests.

PM and foreign secretary to meet Ukrainian president

Meanwhile, Downing Street has said Boris Johnson and Ms Truss will travel to Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday.

On Monday, the prime minister told reporters he will tell the leader to ""step back from the brink"".

Mr Johnson said further incursion into Ukraine would spell ""disaster for Russia"".

During a visit to the Port of Tilbury in Essex, the PM said: ""What I will say to the president, as I've said before, is that I think we really all need to step back from the brink and I think Russia needs to step back from the brink.

""I think that an invasion of Ukraine, any incursion into Ukraine beyond the territory that Russia has already taken in 2014 would be an absolute disaster for the world, but above all it would be a disaster for Russia.""

Defence secretary says eastern European countries will experience consequences of instability

Britain's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has travelled to Hungary for talks with the country's defence minister, Tibor Benko.

Mr Wallace said: ""It's really important that President Putin hears from allies and friends across Europe our disquiet and our worries about what is happening in Ukraine. It's very important to deliver some clear messages.""

""It is clear that we all are in agreement that we don't want instability, we don't want war in the east, we don't want casualties, we don't want migrant flows, we don't want high fuel prices and high food prices which would inevitably flow from any action.""

US President Joe Biden has said Washington is ready for any scenario.

Instead the Met Police's probe, launched last week, will look at whether laws were broken at 12 of the 16 gatherings.

The remaining four ""are not considered to have reached the threshold for criminal investigation"".

Due to the Met's request for ""minimal reference"" to be made to the 12 events detectives are investigating, Ms Gray says it is ""not possible at present to provide a meaningful report setting out and analysing the extensive factual information"".

Reports of the ""bring your own booze"" party in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020 - just two months into the first lockdown - caused outrage.

First published by ITV News, the report revealed that the prime minister's principle private secretary Martin Reynolds emailed around 100 staff inviting them to ""some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"".

It read: ""Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening. Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!""

Just an hour before, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden had appeared at a Downing Street news briefing and told people they could only meet one other person from outside their household.

Around 40 staff are thought to have attended, with the PM present for around 25 minutes, he said to ""thank staff"" for their work on the pandemic.

The Daily Telegraph first reported that two gatherings were held inside Number 10 the evening before the Queen was forced to sit alone at her husband Prince Philip's funeral.

They took place in separate parts of Downing Street but later came together - when COVID restrictions banned indoor mixing.

The first was a leaving party for the PM's then-head of communications James Slack - now deputy editor-in-chief at The Sun.

There were around 30 guests in total at both parties, with one involving a member of staff being sent to The Co-op on The Strand with a suitcase to fill with alcohol.

Reports claimed someone broke the PM's son's swing in the Downing Street garden, while one aide DJed for other staff.

But while he certainly mentioned Brexit at every opportunity and appeared to claim the whole ""partygate row"" was a Remainer plot, his strategy flopped.

Mr Johnson couldn't control his tormentors on the Opposition benches or the would-be assassins on his own side, led by Theresa May, who must have enjoyed her moment of revenge.

Sue Gray report - live: Police handed 300 photos in ""partygate"" probe

Those Tory MPs who did support him from the backbenches appeared to be reading out whips' office handouts. Some of those MPs were very obviously reading.

Amid all the bluster and attacks on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who, as director of public prosecutions, prosecuted journalists but not Jimmy Savile, the PM claimed - was a big broken promise and a major evasion.

The broken promise came in response to former Tory chief whip Mark Harper, when the PM failed to honour his pledge to publish the Sue Gray report in full when it's handed over.

The evasion came when asked repeatedly whether he attended a party, highlighted in the Gray report, on 13 November 2020, allegedly to celebrate the sacking of Dominic Cummings.

Surrounded by some glum faces and silence on the Tory benches, the PM began by declaring: ""I get it and I will fix it"", and promising to create and office of the prime minister, an updated civil service code and a new permanent secretary appointed.

Image: Boris Johnson pictured speaking in the Commons: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor

Really? Is that it? Mr Johnson then started talking about Brexit and COVID and was lucky the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, didn't interrupt him for straying out of order.

But immediately after his Jimmy Savile attack on the Labour leader came two moments of high drama. First, Theresa May said the PM didn't read the COVID rules, didn't understand them or thought they didn't apply to him. Wow!

A flustered Mr Johnson had no answer to that.

Next Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, seemed determined to get himself thrown out of the chamber by repeatedly accusing the PM of lying.

It's a stunt he's pulled before, in 2018 when John Bercow was speaker and he accused Mrs May of lying. This time, eventually, Sir Lindsay Hoyle obliged and Mr Blackford was marched out of the chamber by a sword-wielding sergeant-at-arms.

Then came another assassination attempt from the Tory backbenches. Standing alongside his close friend and ally David Davis, who two weeks ago told Mr Johnson ""In the name of God, go,"" Tory grandee Andrew Mitchell said he could no longer support the PM. Vicious.

Image: Andrew Mitchell said he could no longer support the prime minister

By this stage, there was a lot of shouting at his opponents from the PM and he sounded rattled. Then his friend Sir Bernard Jenkin rose. Relief, surely. The PM must have been hoping for some respite.

No such luck. Sir Bernard, a Brexit crony the PM appointed to the plum post of Liaison Committee chairman, said Mr Johnson would be judged on how he governs over the next few months. Ouch!

As his grilling went on the prime minister was getting more and more shifty. Quizzed by Mr Harper on publishing the full Gray report when it's delivered he said he would decide at the time. That broken promise has the potential to land the PM in big trouble.

But there was more grief from senior Tory backbenchers, led by those MPs dumped from senior posts by the prime minister. He has created a lot of enemies in his two years as prime minister.

Image: Sir Bernard Jenkin warned the PM would be judged on how he governs over the next few months

Sir Robert Buckland, sacked from the Cabinet last year, ominously told the PM he will be judged on his conduct over the next few months. It sounded like the wily Sir Robert may be poised to write a no-confidence letter to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee.

And the saintly Julian Lewis, who lost the Tory whip when he defeated the PM's candidate, Chris Grayling, for the post of chairman of the high-powered Intelligence and Security Committee, demanded publication of the full report now.

In all, after the PM answered questions for just under two hours, the whole session could have been worse, but not much.

It was two hours dominated by questions about previous denials given to MPs by the prime minister over the past few months. He kept repeating the riposte: ""Wait for the police report and Sue Gray's full report.""

If some of his statements in the Commons do turn out to have been misleading or - as Opposition MPs claim - lies, he will be in serious trouble and probably forced to resign.

With this statement, the PM will have hoped to buy himself some more time.

Joseph Kelly, 36, appeared on trial at Lanark Sheriff Court on Monday where he denied the nature of the message posted on 3 February last year.

The tweet said: ""the only good Brit soldier is a deed one, burn auld fella buuuuurn.""

The charge under the Communications Act alleges Mr Kelly made a public social media post that was ""grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character, and that did utter offensive remarks about Captain Sir Tom Moore, now deceased"".

Janet Hunter Jess, a member of the public who saw the tweet, told the court she was hurt at reading the message.

The 72-year-old, whose family served in the armed forces, said: ""To see someone wishing British soldiers dead, it still hurts me. It still hurts me that anybody would disrespect someone that had given their life for the country.""

Luzier Jeffery, Mr Kelly's then-neighbour, said she was ""shocked"" when she saw the tweet.

""First of all, the gentleman in question had done so much to raise awareness and funds for the NHS in England and became a bit of a national hero at the time, but then the fact it referred to British soldiers as well,"" the 51-year-old told the court.

""If you have had anybody who fought for your country, it just left a bad taste.""

She said she spoke to Mr Kelly after he was arrested and claimed he told her he had ""done a lot of stupid things in my time but that's one of the worst"".

""He regretted it from what I can remember, it was a spur of the moment,"" she told the court.

Cameron Smith, defending, told the court the tweet could not be described as ""grossly offensive"".

He argued that while it might be ""unpleasant"" and ""unsavoury"", it did not pass the threshold.

Mr Smith told the trial the message was not about a protected characteristic, such as race, religion, or gender, and did not incite violence.

At one point in the trial, Sheriff Adrian Cottam threatened to put Mr Kelly in the cells if he did not stop shaking his head as prosecutor Liam Haggert spoke about Sir Tom.

Sir Tom, who walked 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday to raise more than £32m for the NHS, died in Bedford Hospital on 2 February after testing positive for COVID-19.

He was knighted by the Queen in recognition of his efforts.

Boris Johnson's birthday

Those include a ""gathering in the No 10 Downing Street flat"" on 13 November, 2020 - the night Mr Johnson's former aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain left their roles.

Also under investigation is the 19 June 2020 event in which Mr Johnson was ""ambushed by cake"", in the words of minister Conor Burns, in the Cabinet Room at No 10 to mark the Prime Minister's 56th birthday. Mr Burns later insisted Mr Johnson had told him there was no cake.

Carrie Johnson, the Prime Minister's wife, reportedly organised the surprise complete with a chorus of ""happy birthday"" and interior designer Lulu Lytle also admitted attending while carrying out controversial work on their Downing Street flat.

In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said: ""Our position from the start has been that, while we don't normally investigate breaches reported long after they are said to have taken place, if significant evidence became available we would assess it. That is now the situation and why we have acted.

""As part of the investigation it is necessary for us to contact those who attended these events to get their account. As a result, the Met has requested that any information identified as part of the Cabinet Office investigation about these events, is not disclosed in detail. This request only applies for the duration of our investigation and does not apply to events we are not investigating.""

The force added: ""Having received the documentation from the Cabinet Office on Friday 28 January, we are now reviewing it at pace to confirm which individuals will need to be contacted for their account. This prioritisation will include reviewing all the material from the Cabinet Office, which includes more than 300 images and over 500 pages of information.

""If following an investigation, officers believe it is appropriate, because the Covid regulations have been breached without a reasonable excuse, a fixed penalty notice would normally be issued. Once the penalty is paid, the matter is considered closed. Alternatively individuals may decide to dispute the notice. In these circumstances officers will consider whether to pursue the matter in a magistrates' court.""

PM's apology

Mr Johnson apologised to the Commons after the publication of Ms Gray's report and promised a shake-up of No 10.

He said: ""I get it and I will fix it.""

Police investigating at least 12 gatherings

Ms Gray's report listed 16 events she had examined as part of her inquiry, but said only four were not now being investigated by the police.

""Unfortunately, this necessarily means that I am extremely limited in what I can say about those events and it is not possible at present to provide a meaningful report setting out and analysing the extensive factual information I have been able to gather,"" she said.

Here, Sky News outlines the most important points in the report.

• Sue Gray concludes that ""a number"" of gatherings ""should not have been allowed to take place or to develop in the way that they did""

• She finds that ""some of the behaviour surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify""

• Ms Gray says ""at least some of the gatherings represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time""

• Ms Gray believes there were ""failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of Number 10 and the Cabinet Office""

• An event at the Downing Street flat on 13 November 2020, the day Dominic Cummings left Number 10, is confirmed as being one of 12 events being investigated by the Metropolitan Police

• Ms Gray says the garden at No 10 Downing Street was also used for gatherings without clear authorisation or oversight. This was not appropriate, she adds.

• She acknowledges she was ""extremely limited in what I can say about those events and it is not possible at present to provide a meaningful report setting out and analysing the extensive factual information I have been able to gather""

• But she does say ""some staff wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work but at times felt unable to do so""

• She continues: ""The structures that support the smooth operation of Downing Street have not evolved sufficiently… the leadership structures are fragmented and complicated and this has sometimes led to the blurring of lines of accountability""

The singer-songwriter was pictured displaying her bare baby bump while out in New York with her rapper boyfriend A$AP Rocky.

Despite freezing temperatures in the city, Rihanna can be seen wearing her bright pink coat open at the bottom, with nothing on underneath, to proudly share her stomach.

The couple were photographed walking around the Harlem neighbourhood, where A$AP Rocky is from, at some time on Friday or over the weekend, and the images were first published on Monday by US media outlets.

Neither Rihanna nor the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, have issued a statement confirming the news.

However, the pictures suggest the star, 33, is several months pregnant and is not hiding it.

In an interview with GQ in May 2021, Mayers, also 33, described Rihanna as ""the love of my life"". Asked if he was ready to be a father, he replied: ""If that's in my destiny, absolutely... I think I'd be an incredible, remarkably, overall amazing dad. I would have a very fly child. Very.""

Rihanna is one of the most famous women in the world and one of the biggest-selling music artists of all time, known for hits including We Found Love, Umbrella, Diamonds, Work, Rude Boy and more.

She is also a businesswoman, having launched her own fashion and beauty brands Fenty and Fenty Beauty, and was officially declared a billionaire by Forbes in August 2021.

In November 2021, she was declared a national hero by the prime minister of her home country Barbados.

Earlier in January, the star pledged $15m (£11.1m) to fighting for climate justice through her Clara Lionel Foundation, which is named after her grandparents.

Neither was wearing a mask during proceedings. They were separated by Home Secretary Priti Patel, also mask-less, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who was wearing a mask.

On Ms Truss's other flank was Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who was wearing a face covering.

Among the measures announced were new financial restrictions on individuals who are significant to the Kremlin.

She told MPs that ""nothing is off the table and there will be nowhere to hide"".

Parents are being urged to make sure children have had their MMR vaccinations and other routine jabs before starting school.

The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. Children can receive their first dose on the NHS at the age of one, and the second dose is available when they are three years and four months old.

Between July and September last year - the most recent figures - just 88.6% of children in England had received their first MMR dose by the age of two, while just 85.5% had received both doses by the age of five.

The World Health Organisation says that 95% of children need to be vaccinated to keep measles away.

Measles is highly infectious and can cause pneumonia, encephalitis (brain inflammation), and damage to the immune system which leaves children more susceptible to other infections.

In rare cases, it can also cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which can lead to destruction of the central nervous system, loss of motor control, epilepsy, and death.

Despite this, 48% of parents and guardians of children aged five and under did not know that measles can lead to serious complications.

Potentially fatal disease

The figures, from research commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care, and the UKHSA, also found that only 38% knew measles could be fatal.

Some 56% were unaware that two doses of the MMR vaccine give 99% protection against measles and rubella.

It is estimated that the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1968 has prevented 20 million measles cases and 4,500 deaths in the UK.

The US CDC says that while rubella rarely causes serious cases in children, up to 70% of adult women may experience arthritis and it can cause serious problems, including brain infections, bleeding problems, miscarriages and birth defects.

Mumps too can result in complications, especially among adults, including inflammation of the testicles, ovaries, breast tissue, pancreas, brain and spinal cord (meningitis).

'Big impact on immunity'

Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said: ""The MMR vaccine offers the best protection from measles, mumps and rubella which is why we're calling on parents and carers to make sure their children are up to date with their two doses.

""Even a small drop in vaccine coverage can have a big impact on population immunity levels and lead to outbreaks.""

Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and medical director for primary care at NHS England, said: ""It is incredibly important that all parents and guardians ensure their child is up to date with their routine vaccinations, including MMR, as these vaccines give children crucial protection against serious and potentially deadly illnesses and stop outbreaks in the community.

""If your child has missed a vaccination, please contact your GP practice to book an appointment as soon as you can to make sure they have maximum protection against disease.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201090832/http://news.sky.com/story/measles-vaccination-rates-drop-to-their-lowest-level-in-a-decade-12530000;'ARTICLE-2: health'

Many democratically elected politicians including the country's de-facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and President U Win Myint were detained.

Others fled or were forced into hiding.

The military regime said concerns of widespread electoral fraud in the 2020 vote was the reason it needed to take power and declare a state of emergency.

The coup sparked mass peaceful protests across the country which in some areas turned to armed resistance after junta security forces responded with lethal force.

More than 1,500 people have been killed and more than 11,000 have been arrested by the regime in the last year according to monitoring group, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners Burma (AAPPB).

Three people spoke to Sky News about their lives since the coup.

Charlotte Bellis's situation gained worldwide media attention after she said she was forced to turn to Afghanistan's Taliban for refuge after being locked out of New Zealand due to its strict COVID border policies.

In a news conference on Tuesday, New Zealand's deputy prime minister Grant Robertson said that the government department in charge of the system that ensures people do not have COVID-19 before they enter the country had now offered her a place, as well as flight arrangements.

He added: ""There is a place in MIQ (Managed Isolation and Quarantine) for Ms Bellis and I urge her to take it up.""

Bellis, who is 25 weeks pregnant, accepted the place and said in a statement: ""I will be returning to my home country New Zealand at the beginning of March to give birth to our baby girl.

""We are so excited to return home and be surrounded by family and friends at such a special time.""

Mr Robertson denied that Bellis was given preferential treatment because she had gained a worldwide audience for her complaint, resulting in embarrassment for a government proud of its COVID policies.

He said: ""What it sends is a message that the staff of (the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment) who have to deal with emergency application are dealing with very difficult and challenging cases on a daily basis.

""They always try to make contact with people and try to make arrangements that work.""

Bellis, 35, is expecting her first child with Belgian partner and news photographer Jim Huylebroek.

Both had been based in Afghanistan while Bellis reported in that country for Qatar-based news channel Al Jazeera.

She found out she was pregnant soon after returning to Qatar late last year, news that forced her to resign and leave the country, as being unmarried and pregnant is illegal.

She said she tried to stay in Belgium but the lengthy residency process would have left her with an expired visa.

In the end, she returned to Afghanistan with the reassurance of Taliban contacts that she would be safe, despite the regime's strict interpretation of Islam.

Meanwhile, she continued her attempts to find a way back to New Zealand, initially joining the many thousands of overseas-based New Zealanders trying to get a place in mandatory hotel isolation via a government-run lottery.

Image: Bellis is 25 weeks pregnant. Pic: Jim Huylebroek

The strict border policy has played a large part in the country's low COVID-19 case numbers but it has also been heavily criticised for keeping many New Zealand citizens effectively locked out of their own country.

With no success in the lottery and with her pregnancy advancing as she waited in impoverished Afghanistan, Bellis applied for allocation under the emergency scheme, which allows places for people who fit into a narrow list of categories. But she was rejected.

Her story came to light when she wrote a column in the New Zealand Herald soon afterwards, saying: ""When the Taliban offers you - a pregnant, unmarried woman - safe haven, you know your situation is messed up.""

She later said: ""It is my legal right to go to New Zealand, where I have health care, where I have family. All my support is there.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201090832/http://news.sky.com/story/pregnant-new-zealand-journalist-who-sought-refuge-in-afghanistan-after-being-locked-out-of-her-own-country-accepts-offer-to-return-with-place-in-quarantine-12530012;'ARTICLE-5: politics'

The UK's biggest supermarket chain launched the Jack's brand - named after its founder Jack Cohen - in 2018 as part of a bid to learn how it could bring down costs and challenge the discounters Aldi and Lidl who had been taking market share for years.

But it said on Monday that six Jack's stores would now be converted to Tesco superstores, with the remaining seven sites to close in the coming months.

Tesco said that around 130 jobs would be affected, including some head office roles, but it hoped to find them new work within the business.

The seven sites listed for closure were:

• Hull

• St Helen's

• Walton

• Castle Bromwich

• Middlewich

• Barnsley

• Liverpool North

It was also confirmed by Tesco that meat, fish and deli counters at 317 store sites would be closed down due to changing customer demand.

However, that was not expected to lead to any redundancies as the staff hit would be offered alternative work. The chain said it currently had 3,000 vacancies in all.

Tesco said it would retain counter services at just 279 stores where custom had been maintained.

The company said it was making the changes to ""ensure we remain focused and competitive in a fast-changing market"".

Its boss in the UK and Ireland, Jason Tarry, said: ""We have learnt a huge amount from Jack's and this has helped Tesco become more competitive, more efficient and strengthened our value proposition, including through the launch of Aldi Price Match.

""In turn, this has enabled us to consistently attract new customers to Tesco from our competitors over the last two years and we know they increasingly recognise the value they can find at Tesco.

""With the learnings from Jack's now applied, the time is right to focus on ensuring we continue to deliver the best possible value for customers in our core business.""

Instead the Metropolitan Police is investigating a dozen events over eight different dates. They have been handed more than 300 photos and more than 500 pieces of paper evidence. And the prime minister is entwined in it.

Four of those events being looked at by the Met were reportedly attended by the prime minister himself.

One of those events - which he denies took place - is an alleged party in his private Downing Street flat.

When it comes to what the PM potentially knew and when, the jury is still out, the evidence not in.

So Mr Johnson's refrain ""wait for Sue Gray"" has morphed into ""wait for the Met"".

He came to the House of Commons armed with an apology - ""I get it and I will fix it"" - and promised to improve his No 10 operation.

But the mood in the Commons was sulphurous, with none other than the former prime minister Theresa May leading the criticism.

On the face of it, the prime minister was bullish and in full strong-man mode.

But a hint of the pressure being applied behind the scenes by his party became all too clear when No 10 was bounced into committing to publish the Gray findings in full once the police investigation is complete.

The PM had repeatedly refused to give colleagues that undertaking in the Commons just hours earlier.

This a reminder that, for all the public show of strength, he is a leader still out of control of his parliamentary party.

He is also still vulnerable to events beyond his control.

The Metropolitan Police is now investigating what happened in No 10 on the back of evidence uncovered by the Gray report.

The prime minister repeatedly told the Commons no rules were broken in his No 10. Can he really square that circle?

And when the full findings come out, can he reassure enough of his MPs to avoid a confidence vote, and enough of the public to give him a second hearing as prime minister?

His allies believe he can ride out this storm, stressing that there is no mood in the parliamentary party to change leaders, and the PM needs time to put the No 10 operation back together and his premiership back on track.

They hope the public will lose interest and the scandal will peter out.

Ms Giuffre is suing the duke in her home country of the US, claiming she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, Andrew's friend and a convicted sex offender, to have sex with the royal when she was 17 - a minor under US law.

The duke is also alleged to have sexually abused Ms Giuffre during a visit to Epstein's private island, Little St James, and on a separate occasion at Epstein's Manhattan mansion.

Image: Virginia Giuffre pictured with lawyer David Boies in 2019

The duke has denied all of the allegations.

What are the main points in Prince Andrew's defence?

Earlier in January, it emerged that Ms Giuffre's lawyers requested help to get testimony from two potential witnesses in the UK, including the duke's former assistant Mr Olney.

Court documents revealed Judge Lewis A Kaplan wrote to the Senior Master of the Queen's Bench Division with the aim of having Mr Olney testify about the duke's communications with Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Ms Giuffre, and the duke's travel to Epstein's properties.

In a separate letter to the High Court, the judge also requested testimony from Shukri Walker - the second potential witness in the UK, who claims to have seen Andrew in Tramp nightclub in London.

Ms Walker's testimony should cover questions about the presence of the duke and Ms Giuffre at the nightclub in March 2001, and any interaction between the pair, the judge said.

Who's who in the Prince Andrew sex assault case?

Meanwhile, Judge Kaplan has also written to the Australian Attorney General requesting assistance in getting testimony from Ms Giuffre's husband Robert, and her psychologist Dr Judith Lightfoot.

The judge asked for Mr Giuffre's testimony to include how he met his wife, any discussions they had about Andrew, her alleged childhood trauma and abuse, and her relationship with Epstein and Maxwell.

The letter also requests testimony about the emotional and psychological harm Ms Giuffre says she has suffered, the Giuffre household finances, and her role in trafficking and recruiting young girls for Epstein.

The judge asked Dr Lightfoot to give evidence about Ms Giuffre's medical treatment, her diagnosis, childhood trauma, the theory of false memories, and her claims regarding Andrew.

""We urge Russia to step back and engage in dialogue to find a diplomatic resolution and avoid further bloodshed.""

The PM said on Monday evening he still hopes to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to defuse the Ukraine crisis after a planned phone call between them was cancelled.

It comes after a tense meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday, a meeting which had been requested by the US to discuss Moscow's troop build-up.

Russia's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said US talk of war was ""provocative"", adding that there was ""no proof"" Moscow was planning military action in Ukraine.

But US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: ""The provocation is from Russia, not from us or other members of this council.""

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was meant to be accompanying Mr Johnson to Ukraine but on Monday night she said she tested positive for COVID-19 so will be staying behind.

She had earlier appeared without a face mask on the front bench in the House of Commons before announcing a strengthening of sanctions legislation that will give the UK the power to target any company or person linked to the Russian state.

Explainer: What's in the Sue Gray report and which Downing Street parties did she investigate?

Ukraine's president will surely question if Boris Johnson's focus is on Kyiv Deborah Haynes Security and Defence Editor @haynesdeborah Boris Johnson, on a flying visit to Kyiv, seems keen to take a leading role amongst Britain's allies in confronting Russia over Ukraine and threats to wider European security. His critics question whether he is seizing on this foreign crisis to deflect from mounting political woes at home. But there is no doubt that Ukraine's government needs and is hugely appreciative of any UK support given the threat it has faced from Moscow since the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the recent massing of more than 100,000 Russian troops near its borders. Still, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy surely will not be able to help but wonder whether his visitor has other things on his mind than the prospect of invading Russians. Mr Johnson had to delay a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday – a key element in what is meant to be a high-impact week of British diplomacy – because he was in the Commons fending off questions about parties during COVID lockdown In another blow, the prime minister will be travelling to Kyiv solo after his foreign secretary, Liz Truss, tested positive for coronavirus. However, despite all the – forced and unforced – distractions, the UK has still managed to fly out plane-loads of anti-tank weapons – some 2,000 in total – to Ukraine along with a team of around 30 specialist military trainers to teach the Ukrainian armed forces how to use the kit. Britain has also taken a prominent role in helping Ukraine's navy to rebuild after it was decimated by Russia's annexation of Crimea, where its headquarters were based. Outside Ukraine, the UK has pledged to send hundreds more troops to join a NATO deployment on the alliance's eastern flank if needed. That mission, established six years ago, is designed to deter any Russian attack on a NATO member rather than directly prevent a new offensive against Ukraine, which is not – yet at least – part of the transatlantic alliance. But NATO's 30 member states have yet to agree on any expansion of their footprint in the east, such as the Baltic States, and the Black Sea region in the southeast.

Sue Gray report overshadows PM's visit

Ms Truss then attended a packed meeting of Tory MPs where Mr Johnson was making his case to keep his job following the release of the Sue Gray report into lockdown parties at Downing Street and Whitehall.

The report was pared back due to the recently announced Metropolitan Police investigation into 12 out of 16 events in 2020 and 2021 while COVID restrictions were in place - including the PM's birthday celebration and a gathering in his Downing Street flat.

Analysis: The hidden meanings behind Sue Gray findings

Sue Gray report: Main comments There was a ""serious failure"" to observe high standards expected in the heart of government

Behaviour surrounding the gatherings ""hard to justify""

Excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace

Some staff wanted to raise concerns but felt they were not always able to

Mr Johnson promised to make major changes to the way No 10 and the civil service is run after apologising and insisting: ""I get it and I will fix it"".

Despite Ms Gray's limited update on her investigation, she was still scathing about the culture and leadership that led to the events while the country was abiding by strict restrictions.

Opposition MPs used Mr Johnson's statement in the Commons to again call for his resignation, with Sir Keir Starmer accusing the PM of ""hiding behind a police investigation"" and the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford being escorted out of the Commons for refusing to withdraw accusations Mr Johnson lied to parliament.

Strong criticism from Tory MPs

Despite Mr Johnson trying to woo Conservative MPs to support his leadership, more Tory MPs spoke out against the PM.

Former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell told the Commons that the PM no longer has his backing.

Angela Richardson, Cabinet Minister Michael Gove's aide, announced on Monday afternoon she resigned from her role last week over the partygate scandal.

Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said if Mr Johnson fails to publish the Sue Gray report in full ""he will no longer have my support"".

And former PM Theresa May said her successor ""had not read the rules or didn't understand what they meant and others around him, or they didn't think the rules applied to Number 10"".

Conservative MP Aaron Bell said he was unable to hug his family after travelling hundreds of miles to go to his grandmother's funeral in 2020 and asked: ""Does the prime minister think I'm a fool?""

Andrew Bridgen told Sky News the ""buck stops with the PM"" and he thinks ""this is death by 100 cuts, damaging again, his support is ebbing away slowly"".

But others spoke out in his support, with Gary Sambrook, who is a 2019 intake MP - of which many have called for the PM to go - saying ""we love"" Mr Johnson.

Different coronavirus measures around the world will mean airlines are unable to move individually in allowing passengers to travel without coverings, sources have told The Times.

Other such travel rules are being eased by individual governments, with tests for fully vaccinated arrivals in England being scrapped from next Friday, 11 February.

But the newspaper reports that UK carriers are seeking ""international consistency"" before lifting the rule on masks, and will ""act as one"" when easing measures.

A senior aviation source said: ""Until there is a harmonised lifting of mask mandates on flights by governments worldwide it is simpler for airlines to keep the rules in place.""

Most British airlines are following guidelines from bodies including the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

The guidelines say that masks should be worn for the duration of flights, except when eating and drinking.

What are the airlines saying?

Virgin Atlantic told Sky News it adheres to guidance from international and local aviation regulators and governments and has no plans to lift the face mask measure yet.

""We continue to input to the regulators and work together across industry to see when changes can be made, however until further notice, we will require all customers and crew to continue to wear face masks for the duration of their flights, as well as at the airports,"" said a statement.

Neil Sorahan, Ryanair's chief financial officer, also said that there were no plans to change the rules.

He said: ""Masks will be something that will be with us for a while longer to come. If that is the price we have to pay for the next few months, into summer - it's a small price to pay.""

Mr Sorahan said the mask rule would remain in place, similar to how rules on passengers removing liquids from hand luggage at security have been kept over the years.

That measure was introduced in 2006, when police foiled a plot to blow up airliners using liquid explosives.

Another airline source told The Times: ""We'll almost certainly keep the same policy until it is safe to move. For example, the rules in the US are very clear on masks. It would be ridiculous of us to ask passengers to put them on when we enter their airspace.""

And another said that although there were ""hopes that one day we will have a world with no masks… they are going to be with us for a long time"".

Jack Sweeney, 19, turned down an initial offer of $5k to shut down the @ElonJet account, saying the payment wouldn't replace the satisfaction he received from running it.

The SpaceX and Tesla chief described the tracker, which uses publicly available air-traffic information, as a potential threat to his safety.

The University of Florida student described himself to Business Insider as a fan of Mr Musk and said he had created the bot as it ""would reveal what business is going on and where he is going"".

Mr Sweeney has launched similar accounts tracking the planes of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. The accounts state that they track the aircraft, not who may or may not be onboard.

The student also has a part-time job with a company called UberJets, which tracks chartered flights and allows its customers to identify cheap seats.

Student reveals messages from Musk

Mr Sweeney shared a direct message from Mr Musk, in which the tycoon said: ""Can you take this down? It is a security risk.""

""I don't love the idea of being shot by a nutcase,"" he adds.

Eventually, Mr Musk said: ""How about $5k for this account and generally helping make it harder for crazy people to track me?""

As this point, the teenager tried to upsell: ""Any chance to up that to $50k? It would be great support in college and would possibly allow me to get a car, maybe even a Model 3.""

The billionaire eventually declined, explaining it didn't feel right to pay to shut down the account, but Mr Sweeney said that advice he had shared about protecting the jet's identifying number appeared to have been adopted.

The teenager said he had made the correspondence public to try to reopen negotiations with Mr Musk, whether for an increase on the initial monetary offer or an internship.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201120841/http://news.sky.com/story/teenager-asks-elon-musk-for-50k-to-delete-twitter-account-tracking-the-billionaires-private-jet-12530130;'ARTICLE-8: entertainment and culture'

Some of the ""pork pie"" plotters are publicly recanting - one of them, Gary Sambrook, tweeting that he now supports the PM.

But even his allies concede that if the police find he personally broke the law, hand him a fixed penalty notice, or any damaging photos - after all 300 have been handed to the police - come to light, the mood could turn quickly.

The gathering in his flat, allegedly to celebrate the departure of Dominic Cummings on 13 November, which the PM and his wife have both denied, is the biggest cause of concern for his MPs.

Boris Johnson has seized on Sue Gray's suggestion that he will waste no time in overhauling his operation.

The laboratory will continue operating until 2030 following a commitment made by President Biden and Vice President Harris last month, but its long-term future is unsustainable.

For more than 20 years, the ISS has been ""a beacon of peaceful international scientific collaboration,"" said NASA administrator Bill Nelson, but all of its mission goals will have been completed by the end of this decade.

International space station mission goals Enable deep space exploration

Conduct research to benefit humanity

Foster a US commercial space industry

Lead and enable international collaboration

Inspire humankind

NASA expects the future of space science collaboration to lie with commercially operated space platforms and has published a report about how it will be making this transition, including pulling the ISS out of the sky.

""While the ISS will not last forever, NASA expects to be able to operate it safely through 2030,"" the report states.

Advertisement

The agency has testified to Congress that it plans to purchase crew time for ""at least two - and possible more"" NASA astronauts aboard commercial space stations by the early 2030s. Several companies, including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, have plans to launch their own commercial orbiters.

Extending the life of the International Space Station to 2030 is intended to give private industry in the US the time to develop the capabilities needed to operate the microgravity platforms.

How will it de-orbit?

In the perfect scenario, the space station's orbiting altitude will be slowly lowered from its current altitude of 408km (253 miles).

As the altitude of the ISS drops it will encounter an ever-denser atmosphere, adding more drag and pulling it lower still.

The space station will still be travelling so fast that it will begin to heat and cast off debris in a path behind it.

The plan to avoid this debris damaging people or property is to have the ISS crash into an uninhabited area of the south Pacific Ocean, near to Point Nemo.

Point Nemo has been called a spacecraft cemetery because - as the point on the Earth most distant from any land - it is where decommissioned spacecraft are typically aimed when returning to the Earth.

But, of course, there are challenges. NASA warns that if there was higher solar activity this would expand the Earth's atmosphere and thus increase the resistance to the space station's velocity, making it slow and fall quicker - potentially meaning it misses its mark.

As the ISS approaches Point Nemo, its operators will fire its thrusters and those of several vehicles still attached to it for one last time to give it the final push into the sea.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201120841/http://news.sky.com/story/nasa-plans-to-take-international-space-station-out-of-orbit-in-january-2031-by-crashing-it-into-spacecraft-cemetery-12530194;'ARTICLE-4: science and technology'

Grocery prices in the four weeks to 23 January rose by 3.8%, according to data company Kantar.

It adds to the cost of living surge facing households with consumer price inflation in December recorded at the highest level since 1992 and expected to climb further this spring as energy bills go up.

High fuel prices and the prospect of more interest rate rises are adding to the headache.

Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ""Prices are rising on many fronts, and the weekly shop is no exception.""

The latest grocery inflation rate recorded by Kantar was up from 3.5% in December.

It has not been higher since May 2020, when it was skewed by retailers scaling back promotions as they sought to discourage stockpiling in the early months of the pandemic.

""Taken over the course of a 12-month period, this 3.8% rise in prices could add an extra £180 to the average household's annual grocery bill,"" Mr McKevitt said.

""We're now likely to see shoppers striving to keep costs down by searching for cheaper products and promotions. Supermarkets that can offer the best value stand to win the biggest slice of spend.""

Image: Crisps were among the products to see price rises

Kantar said prices were rising fastest in products such as savoury snacks, fresh beef and crisps while falling in fresh bacon, vitamins and beer.

The industry data also showed a 3.8% fall in overall supermarket sales in the 12 weeks to 23 January compared with the same period a year ago, though they were 8% higher than pre-pandemic levels.

Kantar said it reflected the start of a return to shopping patterns that were normal before the pandemic as consumers go back to eating out and need to put less in their trolley on each trip.

The shift in habit was most noticeable in London, with take-home sales of food and drink down 11%.

Meanwhile online purchases were down 15% year-on-year, though at 12.5% of all grocery spending still represented twice the share of the market than before COVID-19 struck.

A resumption of socialising and working in the office seems to have encouraged consumers to scrub up, with razor blade sales up 14% and 20% more demand for deodorant.

Dry January provided a boost to alcohol-free beer, with sales up by 5%.

Monday's figure came after 52,295 cases were reported on Sunday - the lowest figure since 14 December before Omicron had peaked.

As for the daily deaths figure, this was 51 yesterday, giving a total of 155,754 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

The total number of deaths with COVID on the death certificate currently stands at 176,813.

Under-reporting

The number of new cases reported by the government has always been lower than the level estimated by the Office for National Statistics, but the gap has become wider since the arrival of the Omicron variant.

High levels of under-reporting will still be affecting the government's daily figures, meaning the true volume of cases in the UK is increasingly unclear.

The dashboard numbers are limited to all positive lab-confirmed PCR test results in the UK, plus positive lateral flow tests in Northern Ireland and, in England, any positive lateral flow tests not followed by a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours.

Although the dashboard will now also include figures for COVID-19 reinfections in England and Northern Ireland - this data will still be affected by how many people are reporting their test results.

Reinfections spiked during Omicron wave

Professor Steven Riley, director general of data and analytics at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: ""Reinfection remained at very low levels until the start of the Omicron wave.

""It is right that our daily reporting processes reflect how the virus has changed.

""We continue to see downward trends in case numbers and incidence of illness as we work to reduce the impact of the pandemic on our day-to-day lives.

The new study, compiled by 140 researchers in 100 countries, estimates the world to have 73,300 species, with 9,000 not even yet discovered.

But most undiscovered species are rare and live in tropical forests, which are being chipped away at by human activity or its consequences, including the climate crisis, deforestation and fires.

Despite our reliance on trees for things like regulating weather and providing food, timber, medicine and work, we still ""lack a fundamental understanding of how many species exist on our planet"", researchers said.

This knowledge would help us assess which systems can best cope with global change, which need conserving, or how future changes will impact ecosystems, they added.

The report is based on a database of more than 35 million trees in more than 100,000 sites around the world.

Researchers combined this data with statistical techniques to estimate the overall number of tree species.

South America is home to almost 17,000 species and an expected 40% of all undiscovered tree species.

Oceania and Eurasia have roughly 4,500 species each, Africa has 3,500 and North America 1,800.

Thousands of people, from members of parliaments worldwide to former winners, can propose candidates.

Attenborough, 95, whose TV nature programmes have won him worldwide acclaim, and Ms Tsikhanouskaya, who is in exile in Vilnius, are being backed by Norwegian lawmakers who have a track record of picking the winner.

Attenborough, best known for his landmark TV series illustrating the natural world, including Life on Earth and The Blue Planet, was nominated jointly with the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which assesses the state of biodiversity worldwide for policymakers.

They were chosen for ""their efforts to inform about, and protect, Earth's natural diversity, a prerequisite for sustainable and peaceful societies,"" said Norwegian Green Party leader, Une Bastholm.

'Brave, tireless and peaceful'

Ms Tsikhanouskaya was denied power by what Sky's Moscow correspondent Diana Magnay called ""a blatantly rigged election"" in August.

Norwegian parliamentarian Haarek Elvenes recognised her ""brave, tireless and peaceful work"" for democracy and freedom in her home country.

The ONS said recent survey figures showed 66% of adults in Britain had experienced an increase in the cost of living over the past month, with higher energy bills cited as a cause by four in five.

Of those experiencing the cost of living rises, 32% said they were cutting back on their use of fuels such as gas and electricity, the ONS said.

Meanwhile, 53% were spending less on non-essentials and 26% were digging into their savings.

Energy bills rose sharply in October for millions of households when regulator Ofgem lifted the cap on standard tariffs charged by suppliers by 17.1% for gas and 8.7% for electricity.

They are set to see a further big increase in the spring with the expected announcement of a further increase in the cap after wholesale gas prices surged over recent months.

The ONS noted that before the January 2019 introduction of the price cap - a policy designed to protect consumers from unfairly high bills - fluctuations in the price of gas and electricity had been ""smaller and more frequent"".

Lower income households are likely to be hit disproportionately by energy price increases since they spend a higher proportion of their income on utility bills, the ONS said.

Former Scotland international Goodwillie joined Raith Rovers on a two-and-a-half-year deal from Clyde on transfer deadline day.

Goodwillie, who previously played for clubs including Dundee United, Blackburn Rovers and Aberdeen, was ruled to be a rapist in a civil court case in 2017, although no criminal proceedings were instructed.

He was ordered to pay £100,000 in damages by a judge after it was ruled he raped a woman in a flat in West Lothian in 2011. The Crown had previously decided not to prosecute Goodwillie due to insufficient evidence.

The striker, who has three Scotland caps, is currently the top scorer in the SPFL, having netted 15 times for Clyde so far this season.

McDermid was the shirt sponsor of Raith Rovers in 2014, and in 2010 the North Stand at Starks Park was renamed the McDermid Stand in honour of her father, who was a scout for the Kirkcaldy club.

She tweeted on Tuesday: ""I have this morning ended my lifelong support of @RaithRovers over their signing of the rapist David Goodwillie. I have cancelled next season's shirt sponsorship over this disgusting and despicable move. This shatters any claim to be a community or family club.

Since its release on to Disney+ on Christmas Eve, streaming of the film's soundtrack has soared, as fans get their fix of the Lin-Manuel Miranda-penned music.

And now, the tune We Don't Talk About Bruno from the film has landed at number one on the US Billboard 100 - giving Disney its first American chart-topper in almost two decades after knocking Adele's Easy On Me off the top spot.

The track, which also gives song-writing supremo Miranda his first ever US number one, follows the film's magical family as they try to avoid talking about their sibling Bruno, after a number of his prophecies came true.

As well as landing at the top of the US charts, it has also spent two weeks at number one on the UK's Top 40 charts, where it becomes Disney's first ever original chart-topper - and it has eyes on a third week.

Encanto quietly opened in cinemas in November 2021, but quickly shot to popularity once it was released online.

We Don't Talk About Bruno is only the fifth song by Disney, which is famous for its aminated musicals, to ever break into the US top five.

Aladdin's A Whole New World was the last track to hit number one in 1993, while Frozen's Let It Go (2013), Pocahontas' Colours Of The Wind (1995) and The Lion King's Can You Feel The Love Tonight (1994) round out the rest of the studio's top five tracks.

Surface Pressure, another track from the film, performed by Jessica Darrow, also appears in the UK and US top 10s, underlining the film's popularity on music streaming platforms.

In the lead role, the film stars Brooklyn Nine-Nine actress Stephanie Beatriz, who recently told Sky News, when talking about the film's co-writer and song-writer Lin-Manuel Miranda: ""I love him. He's amazing.

""I've known him since we were both like young, poor artists in New York. He's an incredible person, friend, collaborator, artist. I love his work and I think he's an amazing person.""

On Spotify, the world's biggest music streaming service, We Don't Talk About Bruno has notched up almost 102 million listens worldwide - but that is still some way behind the likes of Let It Go (517 million) and A Whole New World (209 million).

However, it was streamed in the US alone 39.5 million times last week, so it could soon surpass the other most popular tracks from the studio some time soon.

An investigation was launched after a complaint that an officer had sex with a drunk person in a police station, but it later uncovered much more.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct appealed for more evidence and other Metropolitan Police officers came forward with evidence of colleagues involved in bullying, violence towards women, perverting the course of justice and using discriminatory language.

WARNING - This article contains offensive language

The investigation centred largely on Charing Cross police station near Trafalgar Square in central London and led eventually to one officer being sacked and others being disciplined.

The watchdog's findings included:

• Police officers exchanged highly offensive racist, sexist and homophobic messages with claims that it was ""banter"" becoming a cover for bullying and harassment

• Messages about police officers attending a festival dressed as known sex offenders and a molested child were sent within a WhatsApp group containing 17 police officers

• Details of messages from WhatsApp groups and a Facebook chat group referring to rape including ""I would happily rape you"" and ""if I was single I would happily chloroform you""

• One police officer was referred to as ""mcrapey raperson"" in a WhatsApp exchange. When officers on his team were asked to provide an explanation for this nickname, one explanation given was that there were rumours about him bringing a woman back to the police station to have sex with

• Evidence of racism including a number of messages with references to African children, Somali people and Auschwitz

• Homophobic language used by officers including one entry that said ""f*** you bender""

• Use of derogatory terms about people with disabilities

• WhatsApp messages about domestic violence, plus sexually explicit, misogynistic and demeaning conversations

• Female officers who challenged sexual harassment were told it was part of police culture, that they should accept, ""play the game or stay quiet"", or leave

• Police officers on probation were intimidated and threats made to cut their hair and belongings

Dismissed as 'banter'

The IOPC's regional director Sal Naseem said: ""The behaviour we uncovered was disgraceful and fell well below the standards expected of the officers involved.

""While these officers predominantly worked in teams in Westminster, which have since been disbanded, we know from other recent cases that these issues are not isolated or historic.""

Investigators reviewed thousands of messages exchanged by officers, many of which it described as highly sexualised, discriminatory or referring to violence. When questioned, officers dismissed the messaging as banter.

Image: One officer has been sacked and others have been disciplined. File pic

Mr Naseem said: ""Our investigation showed the officers' use of 'banter' became a cover for bullying and harassment. Colleagues were afraid to speak out about these behaviours for fear of being ostracised, demeaned or told to get another job.

""We are grateful to those officers who were brave enough to speak to us about the cultural issues that existed within these teams, realising that in doing so they risked further bullying. This took courage.

""Hopefully our learning report and recommendations will give officers the confidence to come forward in the knowledge that people are listening and that changes will be made.""

'I read their messages with disgust and shame'

Of 14 officers investigated, two were fired for gross misconduct and put on a barred list to stop them ever working again for the police. Two officers resigned and two others were disciplined.

The Metropolitan Police apologised and said the officers' conduct did not represent the values of the force. It acknowledged it would have damaged trust and confidence in the Met.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid said: ""I am angry and disappointed to see officers involved in sharing sexist, racist and discriminatory messages. It's clear we have a lot of work to do to ensure bullying and discrimination does not exist in any part of the Met.""

Commenting on the watchdog's findings, Priti Patel said: ""Being a police officer is a privilege which has been abused by these sickening officers.""

The Home Secretary said she expected the force and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to implement the report's recommendations ""as soon as practically possible"".

'Damage public trust in the police'

The IOPC made 15 recommendations to ""seek to tackle underlying cultural issues"" and urged the Met to ""publicly commit to being an anti-racist organisation with a zero-tolerance policy towards sexism, misogyny, bullying and harassment"".

The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""I am utterly disgusted by the behaviour outlined in this IOPC report, which details the shocking evidence of discrimination, misogyny, harassment and bullying by police officers. The conduct of these officers was totally unacceptable and what has been revealed by these investigations will only further damage public trust and confidence in the police.""

It's easy to forget this conflict has been going since 2014. It's now just part of life for those who have stayed behind.

But the scars of the fighting litter the landscape, destroyed and abandoned homes are everywhere.

These towns and villages are sometimes completely abandoned, but the ones that are not are very quiet.

We're in the town of Krymske, in Luhansk region, and apart from the movement of soldiers most of the streets are empty. The conflict and COVID-19 are a double whammy to life here.

""It's terrible. War is war. What can I say? If they shoot grads [rockets] for the whole week, what do you think that is like for us?""

The defensive trenches in this part of eastern Ukraine are essentially overwatch positions to keep an eye on the movements of Russian-backed separatists - and more importantly any invasion by the Russian army.

Conditions in the trenches here in Krymske are miserable and dangerous. The soldiers say in recent weeks there's been more activity and more firing from the other side, especially at night.

Peering through his camouflaged viewing hatch, Artur Vlasov explained that the separatists are never far away.

""We can see their movements because it's a short distance... They walk, they rotate. In Russian military uniform, well, in the same green uniform.""

There's a real sense that this freezing frontline is frozen - waiting for some sort of breakthrough that could relieve the tension.

Image: Most of the streets are empty except for the movement of soldiers

As diplomatic moves and meetings among leaders take place both in Ukraine and abroad, the fact is the two sides are stuck between the battle lines already drawn.

For the soldiers who fight here, and people who live here, there's nothing to suggest this will change.

We stopped at a checkpoint to ask the soldier on duty if he'd be willing to speak us.

56;56;2150;2150;Kim Jong Un: North Korean leader seen limping and riding horse in new film about his 'achievements';Tuesday 1 February 2022 14:51, UK;[];['kim jong un', 'north korea'];['leader', 'filmed', 'jong', 'horse', 'missile', 'korean', 'drone', 'kim', 'various', 'officials', 'limping', 'north', 'riding', 'seen', 'film'];"Kim Jong Un is seen limping in a documentary outlining his achievements over the last year broadcast on the country's state-run television channel.

The 110-minute film, titled The Great Year Of Victory, 2021 and aired on KRT, showcased the North Korean leader's successes in missile development, construction, and efforts to beat the pandemic.

At one point, the leader of the secretive country is seen slowly descending a set of steps, followed by a group of officials, during a visit to a rainy construction site.

A notably slim Kim is carrying an umbrella and appears to be struggling somewhat, but the narration is classically sycophantic.

Fatherly and motherly

""Kim Jong Un,"" the narrator said, ""showed us his fatherly side by doggedly braving snow, rain, and wind while taking on the fate of the nation.

""He treated people like his own children, showing his motherly side, where he completely dedicated his own body to realise people's dreams.""

Image: It was all a bit too much for some of the delegates

This has been seen as a possible reference to the dictator's recent weight loss.

The film also includes much of the content observers have come to expect from such efforts.

He is seen talking at various meetings, addressing a conference of rapt officials (some in tears) and meeting people at various locations.

Military might

As usual, North Korea's military prowess features, with tanks, artillery, parading, cheering troops and countless missiles on show, some of which are seen being launched.

Image: A drone waters crops

Jets and helicopters, trailing coloured smoke and fireworks, criss-cross the sky.

Kim is also seen on a horse, first on a beach in the opening shot and later galloping through a forest.

It should be noted, however, that he is filmed from behind in the first scene, filmed at sunrise, so it is impossible to be certain it is him.

The film shows a drone watering crops and swooping shots of a new residential development, images which contrast sharply with the hardships faced by North Koreans.

Increasing food shortages accelerated by Western sanctions brought in to deter its missile programmes, drought, and floods are some of the issues, UN agencies have said.

Niall Burgess, who was secretary general of the department of foreign affairs (DFA) at the time, tweeted a selfie on 17 June 2020 showing a group of officials in the department's Iveagh House headquarters celebrating Ireland's election to the UN Security Council.

The picture - captioned ""now we're walking on air…"" - showed a tightly-gathered group of around 20 people, with champagne bottles and glasses visible, but was deleted a short time later.

Image: Mr Burgess swiftly deleted the tweet after posting it

What were Ireland's rules at the time - and how were they broken?

Ireland's lockdown rules meant indoor gatherings of more than six people were banned.

People were urged to work from home where possible, and physical distancing and face mask guidance was in place.

An internal DFA report into the event, published last night, found a ""serious breach"" of social distancing rules had occurred at the gathering, which ""caused offence, inflicted reputational damage on the Department and undermined internal morale"".

The report stated that Mr Burgess was found to be ""largely responsible for facilitating the breach of social distance guidance that occurred"".

It recommended that he pay €2,000 (£1,670) to a charity providing assistance to people affected by COVID, and that the three other senior officials visible in the photograph donate €1,000 (£835).

All have agreed to do so, and the report added that no further action would be taken.

The review also concluded that the event was not organised or pre-planned, and that the staff gathered at Iveagh House were ""conducting essential business"".

What's the reaction been?

The minister for foreign affairs, Simon Coveney, said the report was ""fair and balanced"", and described the gathering as a moment of careless celebration that only lasted for around a minute.

But Sinn Fein has called for an independent investigation.

The party's finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty said that ""there is no accountability in this report, and an internal investigation was never going to provide it"".

""It is clear that an independent investigation is the only way to get to the bottom of this,"" he said.

""Sinn Fein have already communicated this to the Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin] in a letter last week.

English star Stephenson Ardern-Sodje, who plays Simba, said that they ""were subjected to racial and homophobic abuse, both verbally and with the threat of violence, while on the way home after the show in Dublin"".

Speaking on social media, Mr Ardern-Sodje said that ""it was a huge blow that hit us hard as a company, opening old wounds for many"".

He added: ""This isn't the first time many of us have experienced something like this, and it's unlikely to be the last, but in these darker moments it's good to be reminded 'that the night must end and that the sun will rise'.""

Another British actor, Rushand Chambers, posted: ""It's just upsetting, all the work, time and energy we've given to then be subjected to behaviour like this.""

""Dublin has been a good experience as well I want to make that clear,"" Mr Chambers added. ""The theatre and audience are beautiful! But we can't ignore the ugly side too. The country needs healing, it's just not our job to do so.""

Fellow cast member Melvin Le Blanc added: ""This needs to stop!!""

What is understood to have happened?

Irish police told Sky News that they were investigating an incident that took place last Friday, 28 January, at Hanover Street East in Dublin.

The street is a very short distance from the Bord Gais Energy Theatre, where The Lion King has been running for the past month.

It's understood that shortly before 11pm, a number of the production's members were subjected to verbal abuse from a group of male youths, after leaving the theatre.

Gardai say no arrests have yet been made, and anyone with any information is asked to contact Pearse Street Garda Station.

In a statement, the theatre said: ""We are saddened to share that several of the performers and crew of The Lion King, currently performing at Bord Gais Energy Theatre in Dublin, were recently subjected to racial abuse on their way home from the theatre.

""It is shocking that something so vile and appalling happened to our colleagues who have brought such joy to thousands of theatregoers since the show opened on 31 December.

""We fully stand with the performers and crew and have put plans in place to support those affected by this incident. We also urge that those responsible be held accountable and have reported this incident to An Garda Siochana.""

Members of the production, which runs in Dublin until Friday, are from the UK, South Africa and France, as well as Ireland.

He warned that a ""package of sanctions and other measures"" is being prepared to be enacted when the ""first Russian toecap crosses into Ukrainian territory"".

Mr Johnson said: ""It is vital that Russia steps back and chooses a path of diplomacy and I believe that is still possible.""

He went on to say Russian troops on Ukraine's border are a ""clear and present danger"" and accused Russia's President Vladimir Putin of trying to redraw the security map of Europe.

When asked on Tuesday morning if any fixed penalty notices would be made public as part of the Metropolitan Police's investigation into the partygate scandal, the prime minister's spokesman said it was for the Met to decide whether to reveal who has been fined.

But hours later, after being asked again, he said: ""As the Met have made clear, generally speaking with Fixed Penalty Notice, individuals are not published in any way. Obviously, we are aware of the significant public interest regarding the prime minister, and would always look to provide what updates we can on him specifically.""

Asked if that meant No 10 would reveal if Mr Johnson was given a fixed penalty notice, the spokesman said: ""Hypothetically, yes.""

No 10 indicated it may not reveal the names of other officials and MPs if they are fined after the Met pointed to College of Policing guidance that says the names of people handed fixed penalty notices, the likely punishment for breaching COVID regulations, would not normally be revealed.

The U-turn comes as another Tory MP has handed in a letter of no confidence in Mr Johnson.

Peter Aldous, MP for Waveney in Suffolk, said he has written to Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, advising him he has no confidence in Mr Johnson as leader of the Conservative Party.

""After a great deal of soul-searching, I have reached the conclusion that the prime minister should resign,"" he wrote.

""It is clear that he has no intention of doing so.

Also speaking to Burley, deputy PM Dominic Raab claimed Mr Johnson cannot answer specific questions about lockdown parties in Downing Street because he does not want to prejudice the police investigation.

""If he does start answering specific questions that have been referred to the police, he will be accused, in fact fairly and rightly, of prejudicing or preventing or interfering in that investigation,"" Mr Raab said.

""He is considered a vital witness to our investigation and will be offered support from professionals to help him come to terms with the terrifying situation he was confronted with.""

Driver had pleaded with police to de-arrest him

Abraham had been arrested on suspicion of murder but was later released on bail until late February.

Last week he pleaded with the police to de-arrest him saying he ""just wanted to stop him hurting anybody further"" and it was ""never my intention to harm"" McCaskre.

McCaskre ambushed his 43-year-old ex-partner Chkaifi and repeatedly stabbed her in Maida Vale, west London, on 24 January.

Several witnesses tried unsuccessfully to stop the knifeman, before the driver ran him over in a blue Renault Clio.

McCaskre died at the scene on Chippenham Road and Chkaifi was also pronounced dead after the attack.

Abraham said his car stalled after McCaskre went under it, and he and other members of the public attempted to free him so they could give him first aid but they were unsuccessful.

Thousands signed a petition calling for him not to face criminal charges.

Members of Ms Chkaifi's family were reported to have described Abraham as ""a hero"".

Reinfection rates averaged around 1.4% of cases until 16 November 2021, when a ""spike in infections took place following the emergence of Omicron"", the UKHSA commented.

""Following that increase in the number of people infected, reinfections rose - with reinfections now representing around 10% of episodes per day.""

Professor Steven Riley, the UKHSA's director general of data and analytics, said: ""Reinfection remained at very low levels until the start of the Omicron wave. It is right that our daily reporting processes reflect how the virus has changed.""

A total of 37,342,083 people have now had a third or booster vaccine - equivalent to 64.9% of the population aged 12 and over.

Elsewhere, many countries have not reached their Omicron infection peak, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said.

Its technical lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, said measures to curb the variant's spread should be eased slowly.

The WHO's emergencies chief, Mike Ryan, has urged countries to chart their own path out of the pandemic and not blindly follow others in relaxing measures.

""If you open doors quickly you better be able to close them pretty quickly as well,"" he said.

Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) figures show huge amounts were wasted on useless equipment, while millions of pounds has been spent getting out of contracts or storing PPE at ports.

Some £673m worth of equipment was found to be totally unusable, according the 2020/21 accounts, while £750m was spent on items that expired before being used.

COVID-19: The latest from the UK and across the world

Nearly £2.6bn was spent on ""items not suitable for use in the NHS"", but which the department thinks can be sold or given to charities.

The DHSC also said the value of its remaining stock had been slashed by £4.7bn as the price of PPE dropped.

Equipment that was scheduled to be delivered after the end of the financial year will lose £1.2bn in value, the figures show.

The £8.7bn total also includes £111.5m for not moving containers full of PPE from a port to their storage facility on time.

No 10 said: ""We stand by the decision to purchase the items that we did. We were acting in a highly competitive global market with many countries imposing export bans and obviously we were seeking to secure PPE for frontline clinicians.""

At the start of the pandemic, prices for protective equipment rose sharply as countries clamoured to get hold of items such as face masks.

The closure of schools led to a loss of around £1.25m as the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme (SFVS) was temporarily suspended.

Almost £250,000 of produce has been donated to food charities, the DHSC said.

Some of the ventilators ministers ordered ""did not fully meet functionality requirements at the time"", incurring costs of £1.1m.

Officials wrote off laboratory equipment valued at £663,000 after two regional testing sites were closed and ""there being no alternative options for repurposing or storing these assets"".

Additionally, a stockpile of intensive care unit items was created to prevent shortages.

The department was forced to pay out £649,000 for two flights from China that were cancelled because the PPE they were meant to be bringing to the UK was not available.

Another cancellation fee, this time of £339,000, was incurred following the cancellation of two contracts for quarantine hotels.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201180834/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-nearly-9bn-spent-on-ppe-during-coronavirus-pandemic-written-off-accounts-show-12530502;'ARTICLE-3: health'

The former actor and comedian, 84, was released last June after nearly three years in prison.

His conviction was overturned by Pennsylvania's Appeals Court, which found Cosby thought he had a non-prosecution agreement with a former district attorney when he gave damaging testimony in his accuser's 2005 lawsuit.

However, the testimony he gave in light of the deal eventually led to his arrest in 2015.

Cosby was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, who waived her anonymity, in 2018 and vowed to serve all 10 years of his sentence rather than acknowledge any remorse.

On Monday, in a 15-page response, Cosby lawyer Jennifer Bonjean strongly rejected the recent attempt to revive his criminal case, claiming it was ""unjustified"".

The bid to review the case, which has been brought by District Attorney Kevin Steele, is something of a long shot.

Just one percent of petitions are accepted by the US Supreme Court.

However, Mr Steele believes there is a chance. The non-prosecution promise is only alluded to in a 2005 news release from the district attorney at the time, who said there was not enough evidence to arrest Cosby.

Mr Steele does not think that amounts to an immunity agreement.";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201180834/http://news.sky.com/story/bill-cosbys-lawyers-ask-us-supreme-court-not-to-revive-sexual-assault-case-12530235;'ARTICLE-4: entertainment and culture'

The operation was launched after female students in the city reported the behaviour of some drivers which ""made them feel threatened and unsafe"".

Police decided to crackdown on the problem by sending undercover officers to some of the areas identified by the students.

""Women should feel safe to walk our streets""

They say the ""harassment of women and girls in any way is unacceptable"" - and released an image of one driver having his details taken by officers after they were caught ""making comments by officers which were classed as causing alarm and distress"".

It comes amid an ongoing movement to end violence and harassment against women, with a number of Reclaim These Streets protests and vigils having taken place across the UK over the last year.

Detective Superintendent Tanya Wilkins of Bradford District Police told Sky News: ""Bradford Police take all reports of violence against women and related offences such as harassment very seriously, and believes women should feel safe to walk our streets.

""Before Christmas officers were made aware of concerns expressed by female students of the behaviour of some drivers in the city which made them feel threatened and unsafe including harassment and harassing comments made against them.

""As many of these reports were third-hand only, plain clothes female officers have been conducting patrols in identified student areas to gain a better understanding of any problems and build an intelligence picture of what is taking place.

""In a recent operation a driver was spotted making comments by officers which were classed as causing alarm and distress under the Public Space Protection Order in place in the city, and a report has been made.""

She said uniformed patrols would also continue in affected areas.

""Harassment of women and girls in any way is unacceptable and we will look to utilise any necessary Police and Partnership powers to positively tackle any issues identified at an early stage,"" she added.

The Reclaim These Streets movement, which rose to prominence following the murder of Sarah Everard, aims to highlight ""street harassment of women and girls"", ""educate boys and men to take responsibility for the problem of violence against women and girls"" and work ""to challenge misogyny in the way our laws are written and enforced"".

""Streets should be safe for women regardless of what we wear, where we walk or what time of day or night it is,"" the group says.

Brady, a former The Apprentice and Celebrity Big Brother star, compared the MailOnline columnist and GB News presenter to convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein during an online campaign lasting more than two months in 2021, Sheffield Crown Court heard during a hearing on Tuesday.

Brady also accused Mr Wootton, the former executive editor of The Sun, of being a sex offender and a murderer and posted an explicit picture of himself and invited Mr Wootton to engage in sexual activity, the court was told.

The 31-year-old will be sentenced on Friday and faces up to six months in prison after pleading guilty to one count of harassment. He was remanded in custody following Tuesday's hearing.

He had originally been due to go on trial in 2021 but proceedings were delayed due to legal problems, the court heard.

On Monday, he agreed to plead guilty to a less serious charge.

Laura Marshall, prosecuting, said that Mr Wootton had been consulted about this and said he ""simply wants the course of conduct to end"".

Image: Mr Wootton is a GB News presenter and MailOnline columnist, and former executive editor of The Sun

The prosecution's case was not opened and details of the offences were not given in court. However, the charge was outlined by the clerk, who said Brady's harassment of Mr Wootton took place between 13 February and 28 April 2021 and included using WhatsApp, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, online blogs and YouTube to cause the journalist ""alarm and distress"".

Flack had died a year earlier, on 15 February 2020. She had been in a relationship with Brady and they were engaged briefly in 2018.

Brady had been remanded in custody in mid-December after a judge expressed concerns about his behaviour towards camera crews and photographers outside court and other actions inside the courtroom.

Judge Jeremy Richardson told Brady on Tuesday: ""I am pleased that this case has, at last, been resolved...

""As I have made clear already, the desire of everybody in this case, including myself, is for you to stop doing what you did. You must move on with your life, it is to be hoped, to sunnier uplands.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201180834/http://news.sky.com/story/caroline-flacks-ex-fiance-andrew-brady-pleads-guilty-to-harassing-mailonline-and-gb-news-journalist-dan-wootton-12530404;'ARTICLE-6: entertainment and culture'

Analysis of the business completed by the 20 clubs showed £295m was spent in total - up from £70m in 2021.

Deloitte's Sports Business Group said it was the second-highest total since 2003, with the bottom five teams accounting for more than 50% of the expenditure as they battle to avoid relegation.

Net spend, player purchases minus player sales, came in at £180m - the highest on record.

Liverpool made the made expensive purchase of the window, as Luis Diaz joined the 2019/20 champions from Porto for an initial £37.5m (potentially rising to £49m).

Newcastle United's new Saudi-led consortium splashed the cash on deals including Bruno Guimaraes - for £35m from Lyon (rising to £40m) - and Chris Wood from Burnley for £25m. The club spent a league-high of £85m in total.

Deloitte said that Premier League spending accounted for nearly 50% of gross expenditure across Europe's ""big five"" leagues (the top divisions in England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy).

Dan Jones, head of the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: ""This transfer window indicates the financial pressures of COVID on Premier League clubs are easing, with spending firmly back to pre-pandemic levels and remarkably among the highest we've ever seen in January.

""The Premier League continues to lead the way globally, retaining its status as the world's biggest domestic football league in financial terms, again supported by full stadia and securing strong overseas broadcast deals.

""Other large European leagues are also edging back to higher spending, but it is Premier League clubs that have notched up the largest total spend in this transfer window, spending almost 150 million pounds more than Serie A clubs, the closest competitor.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20220201180834/http://news.sky.com/story/premier-league-january-transfer-window-spending-back-at-pre-pandemic-levels-12530449;'ARTICLE-7: sports'

Richard Scorer, head of abuse and public inquiries at Slater and Gordon, added: ""I echo the widespread disgust at what we saw and heard in the House of Commons yesterday as Boris Johnson tried to distract from the Sue Gray update.

""As one of the lawyers who represented many of Savile's victims, I can confirm that these allegations against Sir Keir Starmer are completely unfounded and unjustified.

""Sir Keir did more than any other director of public prosecutions to advance the rights of victims.

""No DPP can control every decision. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was much better under his leadership.

""Weaponising their suffering to get out of a political hole is disgraceful.""

Sir Keir: 'It's obviously not true'

Sir Keir told Sky News on Tuesday it is a ""ridiculous slur peddled by right-wing trolls"" and he could see the ""disgust"" on the faces of Conservative MPs behind Mr Johnson as he made the accusation.

""They knew that he was going so low with that slur, with that lie - he had been advised not to do it because it's obviously not true, but he does it because he doesn't understand what honesty and integrity means,"" Sir Keir said.

Image: Sir Keir Starmer denied the accusation in the Commons

Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he was ""far from satisfied that the comments in question were appropriate"" but said ""procedurally nothing disorderly occurred"".

Downing Street said Mr Johnson stands by his comments but his official spokesman refused to repeat the assertion, arguing that it would clash with the principle of civil service impartiality.

However some Tory MPs spoke out against the comments, including former chief whip Julian Smith, who said the ""smear"" against Sir Keir ""is wrong and cannot be defended, it should be withdrawn"".

Fact check

In 2020, fact-checking charity Full Fact looked into the claim Sir Keir had stopped Savile being charged in 2009, when Sir Keir was head of the CPS.

It said the decision not to prosecute Savile was made on the grounds of ""insufficient evidence"", with the allegations against the DJ dealt with by local police and a reviewing lawyer for the CPS.

Wholesale Clearance UK, which sells unwanted stock in bulk, has picked up the collection.

It comments on its website: ""You will notice this is probably more at home on the shelf next to Peckham Spring (Del Boy's bottled water which glowed yellow in the dark) as these are in fact celebrating the Queen's Platinum Jubbly.
