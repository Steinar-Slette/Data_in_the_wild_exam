0;0;5240;5240;‘Shame, ageism and nudity – there’s a lot to identify with’: actor David Pevsner on his memoir;2022-01-06T14:00:05Z;['Emine Saner'];['Stage', 'Acting', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'Pornography', 'Broadway', 'Theatre', 'Culture', 'Society'];"There were things in the first draft of his memoir, says David Pevsner, that his editor thought were “maybe TMI, maybe a bridge too far”. I can’t begin to imagine what was deemed unacceptable, because there is TMI – sample line: “I have always been a copious ejaculator” – on just about every page of Damn Shame, an entertaining, touching and absolutely filthy book. My goodness, the filth! “There is that,” he says with a laugh. Pevsner describes himself, self-deprecatingly, as “a minor player in the entertainment biz”; he’s had small roles in big TV dramas such as Grey’s Anatomy and Modern Family, and bigger roles in small ones. He has been on Broadway, touring productions and off-Broadway hits. He’s not a well-known face, though if you’re a subscriber to his OnlyFans account, where he shares erotic photos and videos of himself, you will be very familiar with his body; Pevsner is, I believe, the only person I’ve interviewed whose erection I have seen. Along the way, to supplement his theatre salary, he has been an escort and a “naked maid”, which had things in common with sex work while also including vacuuming (not a euphemism). He appears, smiling and charming (and dressed), over Zoom from his home in Los Angeles. The online porn has lost Pevsner two acting agents, although it is presumably fairly lucrative in itself. Now 62, he had been posing for nude photographs since his early 30s. It was partly about exploring his own sexuality, he says. “It made me curious to see how far I can take it, how far I could explore what’s really going on inside. I would watch porn and be like: ‘I wish I had the guts to do that.’”
His own explicit photos and videos are also partly political. At his age, it’s about broadening the idea of older people and sex. “It is important because we’re so used to the idea that you get to a certain age and go: ‘I’m done, nobody’s going to want me any more.’ I don’t want people to feel that way. I want them to know that it’s never too late. I’m 62, I’m still desirable. I want people to not shut down, and there’s a lot of shutdown when it comes to age.” The overarching theme of Pevsner’s book is overcoming shame and it’s pretty fair to say, from his exploits, he appears to have largely succeeded. “One of the reasons there’s so many stories of [my childhood in the book] is that you get to know me, my insecurities,” he says. “When we get to the more explicit stuff, people may find some of it a little shocking, but they’ll understand why it’s there.” Pevsner grew up in a Jewish family in Skokie, a suburb of Chicago, where his father was a jeweller. He was an awkward, shame-ridden child and teenager, loathing his body and confused by his developing sexuality. “I couldn’t say: ‘I’m gay,’ until college,” he says. He had girlfriends at school in an attempt to stop the homophobic bullying, though it didn’t always work. “It was demoralising.” He pauses: “There were nights I cried myself to sleep, thinking: ‘I am abnormal.’ I wish I could go back and say: ‘You are so normal. You’re normal but crazy, and crazy in a good way.’ I was a sweet, funny, smart kid. But I had that angst running through me, and I couldn’t talk to anybody about it.” As a child, he discovered his parents’ recordings of Broadway musicals and loved singing along to radio jingles in the car. He would put on little plays at school, although this often attracted more bullying, “so I stopped doing it”. It was going to college, Carnegie Mellon University, to do performing arts, where, he says, “I was finally among other weirdo artists like me. It was helpful to find my tribe, because I didn’t have confidence and had a lot of shame.” It was there that he came out. After graduating, Pevsner moved to New York in 1982 and got theatre work fairly steadily, often working away on touring musicals, then coming back to the city to pick up jobs as a waiter. He talks lovingly of New York in the 80s; how exciting it was, but also frightening. The Aids epidemic hit the city hard. Pevsner would run into friends he hadn’t seen for a while, and realise they were ill. He appeared in a Broadway production of Fiddler on the Roof and “we had a couple of losses there. We just lost so much – personally, professionally.”
For Pevsner, who had only recently started exploring his sexuality, the risk of contracting HIV “put the fear of God into me about sex, and that closed me up a little bit. But I also felt we were all in it together. There was a brotherhood there. We could all kind of put our arms around each other and say: ‘We’ve got to get through this.’” He was scrupulous about safer sex “so I came out OK – but damaged, as many of us did”. The stigma around HIV, and the political inaction, made him furious – and still does, his voice rising at the memories. “They couldn’t get funding early on because Ronald Reagan and [then New York mayor] Ed Koch couldn’t even say ‘Aids’. It was ‘somebody else’s problem’. That created a lot of anger in us.” He writes that living through the crisis – “used as a way to slut-shame gay men” – was probably a reason he later embraced sex so enthusiastically. By the mid-90s, Pevsner’s theatre work was drying up. He’d had success off-Broadway, but it didn’t pay much. His agent had told him he would never get “straight” roles. So he took a job as a “naked maid”, cleaning houses while nude, a role that could take a sexual turn depending on the person who hired him. After that, escort work was not a huge leap. It wasn’t just about money. Pevsner calls his couple of years working as an escort “the best job I ever had outside of showbiz. I met lots of great people who were happy that I was there. I’m a caretaker guy; there were times when they would be like: ‘My mom just died, and I just needed to feel something.’ So I would go and we would talk. It wasn’t all just about, you know, plugging each other up. I just found it was something I took to.”
Did he ever feel exploited? “Absolutely, when it was just: ‘Do your job and leave.’ But I enjoyed that as well – as long as I was the one in control. It just tapped into so much about my libido, my sexual ability, my caretaking. There was a lot of psychology involved with it, a lot of role-playing. It was all the things I was good at!” There are some alarming scenes in his book (one involves toenails) but he insists that escorting wasn’t a bad experience: “I can’t say that that’s how it is for everybody.” Still, he stopped in his 40s, and started a decluttering business. Alongside, Pevsner wrote songs – putting his filthy poetry to music – for the revue show Naked Boys Singing!, and performed two of his own one-man shows. It has not been, of course, to everyone’s taste. Does he mind criticism? “I used to,” he says. He remembers sending a CD of his songs to a friend, a successful Broadway musical director, who was scathing. “He was just like: ‘I hate this. Why do you think this dirty stuff is funny?’ I thought [my songs were] funny, clever and sexy. Some people are offended by it. Some people did not want to hear a song about anal warts, for instance.” He smiles, mischievous. “But to me, it’s one of the funniest songs I’ve ever written. It’s where I learned, after really heavy criticism, you’re not going to please everybody. You’ve got to write with your heart, put it out there. And somebody will respond.” It is what he wants to do with his book. “A lot of it is a fish-out-of-water story,” and many people can relate to that, he says. “The elements of shame, ageism, the fear of sexuality and nudity – there’s a lot to identify with.” Does it all – the filthy songs, the online porn, the eye-popping memoir – make him feel very exposed? “I guess I do,” he says, after a pause. “But I am gobsmacked and thrilled that I had the guts to do it.” Damn Shame: A Memoir of Desire, Defiance, and Show Tunes by David Pevsner is published by Penguin Random House.";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/06/shame-ageism-and-nudity-theres-a-lot-to-identify-with-actor-david-pevsner-on-his-memoir;5
1;1;5241;5241;Broad’s bittersweet blitz proves a point he should not have had to make | Andy Bull;2022-01-06T14:00:04Z;['Andy Bull'];['Stuart Broad', 'Ashes 2021-22', 'England cricket team', 'Australia cricket team', 'The Ashes', 'Australia sport', 'Cricket', 'Sport'];"Around half-five on the second afternoon, Joe Root turned, again, to Stuart Broad and asked him to come back for his sixth spell of the innings. The sun was a little lower but other than that the only thing that had changed since he finished his last, less than an hour previous, was that Australia had pressed further ahead. The two batsmen Broad had been bowling to then, Usman Khawaja and Mitchell Starc, were still in, and that much better set, Mark Wood had run out of luck, Jimmy Anderson had run out of inspiration, the partnership was up to 40 runs and Australia were closing in on a total of 400. Whatever little flutter of hope England had when the last wicket fell had faded away again, and left everyone who shared in it feeling all the more foolish for thinking it would ever be any other way. Which fits. The decision to leave Broad out of the team for two of the first three Tests was a poor bit of judgment that will come to define this tour, as well as the career of the coach who made it. Like Broad said, given the way England batted in those matches picking him wouldn’t have made so very much difference. But it would have at least shown that the management knew who was in their own best XI.
Now he had been selected, Broad didn’t need much persuading to come back for that extra spell. He needed one more wicket for his five-fer, and a place on the SCG honours board alongside his dad Chris, who made a century there in 1988. It had been 18 months since Broad last took five wickets in an innings, against West Indies at Old Trafford in 2020. Of course he missed the last few months of that stretch after he tore his calf during a training session before the second Test against India during the summer just gone. It was a bad injury, which needed surgery, and three months of recuperation. Kevin Pietersen warned Broad that a similar injury had finished his own playing career. Broad is 35, and has a second life lined up in TV, there must have been times when it felt touch and go whether it would end his too. For the first two weeks, he couldn’t even put weight on his foot. After that, there were the long hours treading water in a swimming pool, followed, as he got fitter, by lonely road and gym sessions, then trips to Wimbledon Cricket Club to take tentative steps in the nets, and solitary journeys up to Loughborough to bowl stretches of 10, 12, 14 overs in front of his rehab team. At the front of his mind all the time, the lure of one more tour to Australia, and the prospect of taking the new ball in the first innings at Brisbane, and bowling to David Warner again. The promise of it got him through. Of course it didn’t work out the way he’d dreamed it, it rarely does. Broad has ended up a bit-part player on tour, picked for one Test on a flat track in Adelaide and then another now the series is over already. There was a time when he would have spoken out about exactly how he felt about it, like he did when they dropped him from the Test against West Indies at the Rose Bowl in 2020, but this time he’s tried, some minor grumbling apart, to bite his lip. The men picked ahead of him, Ollie Robinson and Anderson, made a strong case with their wickets, and besides, there were plenty of other good judges making Broad’s point for him in the papers and on TV.
It must have left him addressing those same questions all over again, about whether, and why, exactly, he wanted to go on flogging himself for a team who didn’t seem to rate him enough to pick him when they needed him. He said before this Test that he wasn’t going to make a spur-of-the-moment call about retirement. He says he’ll make the decision between now and the spring tour to the West Indies. But first, he had a point to prove. This was the 19th five-fer of Broad’s career. The highlights make it look as good as any of them. He got Warner, of course, in the classic fashion, just the way the two of them must have pictured it, with a delivery from around the wicket that zigged one way and then zagged the other, Steve Smith, too, and Cameron Green, caught behind with similar deliveries, then a vicious bouncer to remove Pat Cummins, and a cutter that had just enough on it to beat Khawaja to finish. That last one was his 125th in Ashes cricket. Among Englishmen, only Ian Botham has more, with 128.
But it wasn’t his best bowling, Broad often takes his wickets in fits and sparks, there was none of that this time, just a lot of craft, sweat, and toil. It took him 29 overs – the last time he bowled that many in an innings in which he took five was back in 2009 – and there were moments when Khawaja, Starc and Nathan Lyon were laying into him, when he looked just as vulnerable as any of his teammates. But he persisted, bowling a line and length that, the data showed, he’d often struggled to find on his previous three tours here. He drew more false shots from batsmen than he has done in the past, too. And he made his point. How bittersweet for the team that it came so late.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/06/stuart-broad-bittersweet-blitz-proves-a-point-he-should-not-have-had-to-make-ashes-cricket;4
2;2;5242;5242;Elvis Costello: ‘The OBE is just another bauble in my china cabinet’;2022-01-06T14:00:04Z;['Dave Simpson'];['Elvis Costello', 'Music', 'Pop and rock', 'Culture'];"Best gig ever: 3.30 in the morning, sun coming up, watching from the front as you played to an uninterested crowd at Oxford’s Trinity College May ball, 1981. You must have thought you’d sold your soul to the devil. kiwisimmo The fee was good and we needed new amplifiers. I remember lots of “girls” – as they might have called them in an upper-class novel – being sick in the bushes and people tearing around in outfits. They made the mistake of giving us rooms and free champagne. Pete [Thomas], our drummer, was an enthusiastic drinker in those days and took off into the night wearing a gown and a tiara. Does accepting an OBE show you are not the person who wrote Any King’s Shilling? pipini It’s just another bauble in my china cabinet, along with the MTV Video Music award, which no one knows I’ve got, either. Look, my grandfather Pat McManus was in the Royal Irish Regiment and died from illness resulting from wounds he got fighting for king and country. My dad [Ross McManus] went in through the tradesman’s entrance to sing at the Buckingham Palace staff ball in 1962. So, apart from the fact that my mum told me to go and have a laugh, I thought: “I’m going in through the front door.” It doesn’t change my view of the idea of empire as ludicrous and hideous. One of the gentlemen working there was a fan and he’d written this great setlist on Buckingham Palace notepaper. That’s my nicest memento of it.
I loved The Death of Magic Thinking [from his new album, The Boy Named If] on your recent US tour. Does it have anything to do with Joan Didion’s book The Year of Magical Thinking? justalackey The song is about the terror of leaving childhood, when the wonderful inventions of your imagination come up against teenage lust and algebra. The Sopranos writer David Chase gave me the title when I met him at a supper 11 years ago. I told him my boys had started school and he said: “School. The death of magic thinking.” I knew exactly what he meant. I believe This Year’s Model is your best LP. Do you agree? aubraccity Every 35 days I’d agree, and on another day I’d recommend something like North, which a lot of people didn’t like, but came from the heart. The music industry prefers the orthodox to new ideas, but I’ve always tried to do something else, even at the risk of losing some of my audience. Oliver’s Army contains a phrase that seemed shocking then, but now is considered unspeakable. If you rewrote the couplet, what would its replacement be? DaveDumanis I believe I was wide awake when I wrote the song about career opportunities, but sadly that two-word slang is a historical fact. It was a derogatory term for Irish Catholics, which I sang to make the point. One dreads to think how the officer class spoke about people of colour. Perhaps I’d express the same idea differently now. I’ve tried changing that verse, but after 44 years I’m done singing it. I’ll sing (What’s So Funny ’Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding instead.
Seeing Taylor Swift release new versions of her albums, are there any of your albums you would like to revisit? TeardropsStart We did This Year’s Model as Spanish Model, with Spanish-speaking singers, but if Taylor Swift wants to record all my albums, I’ll not stop her. What percentage of your audiences is female? FifiCorr It depends on whether I open my eyes. I told Iggy Pop that I’d always imagined the [Hollywood venue] Whisky a Go Go would be full of girls in hipsters doing the pony dance, like in films, but by the time I played there it was people wearing bin liners. He said that in the 1960s it was exactly like I’d imagined, but often the reality – in the words of John Cooper Clarke – is some shaven-headed chap with his long-suffering wife saying: “I’m freezing, Charlie, haven’t they finished yet?” while listening to our set. Any news of the long-mooted new Burt Bacharach/Costello music for a possible Broadway show? Paul_Hocker Burt and I were in Capitol studios in the summer with a 30-piece orchestra, cutting two new songs for a collection looking at our nearly 30-year collaboration. We worked on two musical scores simultaneously about 12 years ago, but sadly Painted from Memory and a proposed Austin Powers musical ran into legal complications. At least we got to work together again. He’s 93 and the intensity of his focus is undimmed. He’ll go: “Elvis, in bar six, you’re not singing the right melody.”
Which cover versions of your songs have you enjoyed, apart from Robert Wyatt’s Shipbuilding? NewProfile Robert’s is the original and mine is the cover, because it was written for Robert to sing. My favourite cover is Roy Orbison doing The Comedians live at the Cocoanut Grove [in Los Angeles]. I was the rhythm guitarist in the band and when you met this lovely gentleman you’d never imagine he had that power of voice. Oddly enough, my most covered music is The Juliet Letters. There’s an incredible Polish cabaret version, a piano version, string quartets, all sorts. Have you ever met or wanted to work with Neil Young? quilt The first time I played the Bridge School benefit [Young and his late wife Pegi’s event for speech-impaired children], in 1990, I heard this disembodied voice singing harmony during Alison, and Neil walked out with a hand mic. It was great. He played Slane Castle in Ireland when I lived there and my agent, who is also Neil’s, said I should surprise him and sing on Rockin’ in the Free World. I slunk on stage, Booker T from the MGs was singing backing and he pointed to a piano and said: “Take it, Elvis,” like in a dream. Fiona Apple’s performance of I Want You on YouTube is stunning, disturbing and even upsetting. What more can you tell us? Strawwdog Imagine being stood next to Fiona when she did it. It was at some crazy production in Atlantic City. I’d never assume that anyone from a younger generation would know who we are, but she threw herself into it. As the guitarist, I was just trying to match her intensity. By way of thanks, we put a lot into our version of her song I Know. Do you agree that your Saturday headline on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury in 1987 is the festival’s finest two hours? Bestbeforeoctober88 I could win money in a pub quiz or provoke uncontrollable laughter by suggesting I ever headlined the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury, but it was different then. I’d say ’84 was better. More recently, I was third on the bill to the Rolling Stones and managed to get into the inner sanctum. I was chatting to Keith Richards, Mick Taylor and Ronnie Wood when Charlie Watts, bless him, came up and, without saying hello to me, said: “Hey Woody? Who is this fella, married to Diana Krall? What’s that about?” It was fantastic, because, being a jazzer, he was a huge fan of my wife.
How do you feel about the lemonade? wjelly [He laughs.] In the 70s, I was the backing vocalist on an advert my dad did for R White’s Lemonade. Secret Lemonade Drinker saved Christmas when we were broke, and after I had a hit they revived it. I actually preferred Moorhouse’s green cream soda, which was big in Birkenhead. I’ve discovered that Moorhouse’s became R White’s, so it seems I was drinking R White’s long before I knew it. Tramp the Dirt Down and Shipbuilding being obvious exceptions, why have you steered clear of political songwriting? Ummmmm I never sit down and think: “I am now going to write a political song,” but if we’re speaking about things I’ve sensed or seen, then perhaps I can interest you in the following titles from our catalogue of human misery and wickedness and the groovy lessons there: Less Than Zero, Night Rally, Oliver’s Army, Little Palaces, Pills and Soap, Invasion Hit Parade; [This Sad] Burlesque from The Juliet Letters; Bedlam and She’s Pulling Out the Pin from The Delivery Man; The River in Reverse; Red Cotton from the unfinished opera The Secret Songs; Bullets for the New-born King and One Bell Ringing from National Ransom, American Gangster Time; all the songs with the Roots on Wise Up Ghost; Blood & Hot Sauce from the A Face in the Crowd score; We Are All Cowards Now from Hey Clockface; and I guess Nick Lowe’s (What’s So Funny) ’Bout Peace, Love and Understanding. Does that answer the question? What would be your favourite Liverpool FC XI? TheJohnYoung The 1965 FA Cup side, which I can still name. When Roger Hunt died this year, it was really a moment. When people ask who my ultimate hero was, expecting someone from music, the only person I ever thought of in heroic terms was Roger Hunt. I could never play football any good, but Roger looked like a footballer; he never got sent off. He was like a Roy of the Rovers kind of invention and after he stopped playing he went back and worked in his family business. He didn’t haunt the club.
Which is the best invention – space travel or gravy? Stuntman Gravy is ghastly. I don’t like it, because I come from another planet. For years, in Little Palaces, I heard: “The sedated homes of England / Who does defend the lies?” instead of: “The sedated homes of England / Are theirs to vandalise.” Any other examples of this? peilefella I like that line and might use it from now on. I once recorded a demo of Bob Dylan’s You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go for a George Jones record I was hoping to persuade him to let me produce. I sang it as a country song and in all honesty sang: “Relationships have all been bad / Mine have been like lanes and rambles.” Much later, somebody pointed out that the line was actually: “Verlaine’s and Rimbaud’s”. My guess is that George Jones was not a huge fan of French symbolist poetry. You find yourself on stage at the 2024 Republican National Convention with Donald Trump in the front row.

3;3;5243;5243;Edward O Wilson obituary;2022-01-06T13:50:13Z;['Georgina Ferry'];['Biology', 'Biodiversity', 'Science', 'US news', 'World news', 'Alabama', 'Society'];"When the naturalist Edward O Wilson was a boy of seven, the dorsal spine of a fish that he was reeling in near his home in Mobile, Alabama, damaged his right eye. He lost the sight of that eye and subsequently suffered partial hearing loss in his teens. These disabilities led Wilson, a passionate naturalist from an early age, to focus on small organisms, particularly ants, that he could study at close range. Observing their tiny worlds led him to a global vision of the importance of biological diversity in the survival of species including our own. Wilson, who has died aged 92, has been called a modern Charles Darwin for his influence as both a close observer and a unifying theorist. He was also a campaigner whose humane and elegant writings were among the first in recent times to argue that we have a moral duty to value other species, not only for their own sake but also for the sake of future human generations. Fascinated by the apparent selflessness of social insects such as ants and bees, which would sacrifice themselves to protect their colony, in 1975 he published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The book sought to provide an evolutionary explanation (based on the work of the Oxford University zoologist William Hamilton) for the existence of apparently altruistic behaviour in a wide range of species. A single chapter addressed altruism in human societies, suggesting that humans evolved to support the reproductive success of their close relatives as a way of ensuring that the altruistic individual’s genes were represented in succeeding generations. Although Wilson argued that human altruism and social structures were also products of culture, his book provoked a resurgence of the “nature v nurture” debate. Soon after its publication, a number of high-profile biologists, psychologists and sociologists from his own university, Harvard, wrote a furious letter to the New York Review of Books, denouncing him for biological determinism and implying that he was providing support for racist and sexist beliefs. Long before the days of the Twitterstorm, opponents whipped up such rage against Wilson that in 1978 protesters dumped a jug of iced water over him as he sat on the platform at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Not in any way deterred, Wilson followed up with On Human Nature (1979), for which he won his first Pulitzer prize. Today most scientists accept, as Wilson argued, that genetically determined “human nature” includes the capacity to develop extremely flexible patterns of social behaviour under the influence of culture. By the time Sociobiology was published Wilson had already developed ideas that would prove even more influential in ecology and conservation. As a young researcher, he had travelled widely in his quest to document some of the millions of species of ants and other invertebrates. Observing and collecting in New Guinea, the South Pacific and the Florida Keys, he began to think about how different species disperse, compete, survive or become extinct in a confined area such as an island. With the ecologist Robert MacArthur he wrote The Theory of Island Biogeography (1967), showing how a balance developed between immigration of new species and the extinction of previous residents based on birth and death rates and the number of individuals the environment could support. They distinguished between animals that produce many young and invest little in their care (r-strategists) and those that produce fewer young but care for them in early life (K-strategists), depending on the stability of the environment. Today ecologists recognise that there is a continuum between the two life history strategies, but the concept has been highly influential. Wilson’s numerous contributions to his field also include the discovery that insects used complex systems of chemical signals to organise their societies. Just as Darwin developed much of his theory of natural selection from studying finches in the Galapagos archipelago, Wilson’s work had implications far beyond island habitats. As burgeoning human populations encroach on wild spaces, they confine the habitat that remains to smaller and smaller parcels. Wilson’s work showed how this has led to a collapse in biological diversity, with consequences beyond the loss of individual species. In the latter part of his life he became a prominent advocate for the conservation of biodiversity. His book Biophilia (1986) argued that an affinity for other species is fundamental to humanity. In 2016, aged 87, he published Half Earth: Our Planet’s Fight for Life, building on an earlier idea that we should set aside half of the planet’s surface for wildlife. His language was forthright and decidedly un-academic. “We’re extinguishing Earth’s biodiversity as though the species of the natural world are no better than weeds and kitchen vermin,” he wrote. “Have we no shame?” Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he was the only child of Edward Wilson, a former army accountant, and Inez (nee Freeman). His parents divorced when he was seven, briefly placing him as a boarder in the Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Mississippi. As he wrote in his autobiography, Naturalist (1994), the strict discipline of the school, and the southern code of behaviour inculcated by his father, left him with a belief that he should “never back down if honour is at stake”; he attributed his later willingness to face up to his academic opponents to this upbringing. He dealt with the unhappiness in his home life by focusing intently on the natural world, deciding at the age of 11 to document every species of ant in his home state. At 13 he made the first report that fire ants, an invasive species, were living near his home in Alabama. While still an undergraduate at the University of Alabama, he published a survey of the fire ant’s progress across the state. He began a PhD at the University of Tennessee before transferring to Harvard, which housed the largest museum collection of ants in the world. He spent the rest of his career there, winning a second Pulitzer prize in 1991 for his monumental volume The Ants (co-authored with a fellow entomologist, Bert Hölldobler). He retired from teaching in 1996 but continued to write and campaign as professor emeritus and honorary curator in entomology. He received numerous honours, including the US national medal of science and the Crafoord prize (often regarded as a Nobel prize for ecologists). The E O Wilson Biodiversity Foundation was set up in his name in 2005 to continue his educational work in conservation. In October 2021 Wilson participated via video link in a discussion with David Attenborough on the Half Earth concept, where he was asked to comment on whether the Covid-19 pandemic would change attitudes to the interconnectedness of species. He replied that in future the pandemic would be regarded as “just a flick on a movie screen”, but, he added “We will never come out from under the loss of species that we have been carelessly allowing to happen just by our ordinary everyday activities. Extinction is for ever.” Wilson married Irene Kelley in 1955 and they settled in Lexington, Massachusetts. She died in August 2021. Wilson is survived by their daughter, Catherine. • Edward Osborne Wilson, biologist, naturalist and author, born 10 June 1929; died 26 December 2021";https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/06/edward-o-wilson-obituary;6
4;4;5244;5244;Women losing their periods because of restrictive diets and excessive exercise;2022-01-06T13:47:56Z;['Sarah Marsh'];['Menstruation', 'Women', 'Life and style', 'Society', 'Health', 'Social media', 'Diets and dieting', 'Eating disorders'];"An increasing number of women are losing their monthly periods because they are following a social media trend for restrictive diets and excessive exercise, experts say. Charity heads and nutritionists have raised the alarm about the increase in hypothalamic amenorrhea, a condition where the body enters survival mode because it is under-fuelled, causing menstruation to stop. It is a reversible disorder caused by stress related to weight loss, excessive exercise and trauma. Martha Williams, a clinical advice coordinator at the leading eating disorder charity Beat, said the condition was becoming more widespread, and was often seen in people who were not underweight and did not have a low body-mass index. “There are not exact statistics on this issue but the majority of people we see have lost their periods and some of these women are not seriously underweight. Some are a healthy weight but have restrictive eating,” Williams said. Women often consulted their family doctor when their period stopped, but Williams said many GPs did not have the right training to spot the underlying cause, and prescribed the contraceptive pill to restart menstruation. Williams said the pressure of lockdown was difficult for a lot of people, and the message from the government promoting an hour of exercise a day was not helpful for everyone. “The emphasis on this message was likely quite damaging for someone struggling to regulate their exercise levels.” She added that social media could be a “problem”, because women shared edited photos of their bodies, creating unrealistic expectations of how people should look. Williams said fitness influencers would also tell their followers what they ate in a day, including how many calories, which did not help those with eating disorders. Women have been raising awareness on Instagram about the implications of overexercise and so-called clean eating – a restrictive diet concept where a person avoids refined and processed foods. Chloe Hodgkinson helps girls with disordered eating, amenorrhea and periods, based on her own experiences. When she stopped taking the contraceptive pill her period did not return, and doctors said it was normal for menstruation to be delayed. Although Hodgkinson felt it was related to the fact she was undereating, because her body mass index was not low doctors did not take her seriously. She went to a dietician who told her she had low oestrogen, after which she changed the way she approached exercise and eating, and her periods resumed.
“I have clients who have worked with a dietician or nutritionist or doctor and I help them get back into training after losing their cycle and help keep them accountable to their period journey,” she said. Hodgkinson gets more than 20 messages a day, “with girls simply wanting answers because they can’t get them anywhere else. “They can relate to me, they see old me in them now and see that I’ve come out the other side … They need to support to see that life is better this side,” she said. Renee McGregor, an eating disorder dietitian, said in the past 12 months she had had 1,000 hours of contact time with clients and 95% of them had had hypothalamic amenorrhea. “It’s a big problem, bigger than people appreciate, particularly because for so long it has been – not that it should be – accepted that when women do lots of exercise they lose their period.” She said the problem was often misdiagnosed, with women being turned away from GP surgeries and told their period had not resumed because their body was getting used to coming off the pill. “I had someone last week who was told by a gynaecologist that because they do not want children right now it’s not a problem. But not menstruating has a wider impact on physical and mental health,” she said.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/06/women-losing-their-periods-because-of-restrictive-diets-and-excessive-exercise;7

Three planes were diverted to other London airports as controllers from Air Navigation Services were forced to shut down the malfunctioning IT and guide planes in under a backup system. Passengers on British Airways flights returning from Antigua in the Caribbean and Tampa in the US found themselves landing 45 miles away at Heathrow at the end of their overnight flights. After a delay of more than two hours, the planes refuelled and continued on to the Sussex airport. An easyJet flight from Belfast was diverted to Luton airport, on the other side of London. The three flights were diverted during the “switch down” of the IT system, which started at 7.25am. Other planes were left circling and delayed until the normal systems were restored at 9.10am.
A Gatwick spokesperson said: “Earlier IT issues in the air traffic control tower this morning have been resolved and flights are arriving and departing the airport as normal. Some flights may still experience delays however and passengers are advised to check their flight status with the airline.” A spokesperson for easyJet, the biggest airline operator at Gatwick, said it was “experiencing some disruption to our flying programme as a result” of the IT failure. “While this is out of our control we apologise for the inconvenience caused by the diversion and delays and would like to thank passengers for their patience and cooperation,” they added. The disruption was limited. Only about 300 flights in total were expected to land or take off from Gatwick on Thursday, as services return towards normal levels from the depths of the pandemic. In 2019, Gatwick was the busiest single-runway airport in the world.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/gatwick-it-glitch-stops-flights-landing-taking-off-london-airport;2
6;6;5246;5246;Tracey Emin to launch ‘revolutionary’ art school in Margate;2022-01-06T13:44:53Z;['Nadia Khomami'];['Tracey Emin', 'Art', 'Kent', 'England', 'UK news', 'Art and design'];Tracey Emin has said she is launching her own “revolutionary” art school in Margate as part of her broader plan to transform the seaside town into an “artist’s haven”. The school, named TKE Studios – after her full name, Tracey Karima Emin – will be housed at a former bathhouse and mortuary five minutes from her studio. Emin said she wanted to redesign the location into 30 studios for future art students. “People will have to apply, and there’ll be really strict rules,” she said in an interview with the Times. “No subletting, no smoking, no loud music. And if people don’t want to do the rules then they won’t have a studio there. “The other thing, because the rents are going to be so low, I’m not having people having part-time jobs and then never coming in. So, I’m setting it up so they … will have time to work and paint.” Students will be required to regularly put their work on public view, Emin added, “so there’s like this constant intellectual rigour. People can’t just be passive”. The mortuary will be turned into a “mini museum” filled with her own work. Emin will also launch an accompanying artist’s residency programme at a separate location to encourage artists to permanently move to Margate, where she grew up and returned after the death of her mother. “So it’s organically making the place right for the right people,” she said. “I love art. And I love property. And this way I’m combining both my loves and doing a bit of good.” The artist, who underwent invasive treatment for a cancer diagnosis – including having her bladder and womb removed – said she had a new outlook on life and renewed sense of purpose. “You know in life you sort of amble around, and you don’t know what you’re doing, but you know you’re doing something? And then suddenly you see the light. You go: ‘Oh my God, that’s what I’m doing!’ Well, with Margate now, especially after the cancer and everything, it’s all making sense what I’m doing. I am sort of helping. I am making an artist’s haven.” Emin, who shot to fame in the 1990s with her work, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995, said last year people had not understood the “seriousness” of her art and wrote her off as a “narcissistic, deranged, screaming banshee”. Her recent exhibitions include a 2018 neon sign in St Pancras station in London that reads “I want my time with you” and last year her paintings, neons and sculpture were exhibited alongside those of Edvard Munch at the Royal Academy.;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/06/tracey-emin-to-launch-revolutionary-art-school-in-margate;5
7;7;5247;5247;Combination of cost of living crisis and Covid spell trouble for Boris Johnson;2022-01-06T13:42:35Z;['Jessica Elgot'];['Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Energy bills', 'Consumer spending', 'Politics', 'Household bills', 'UK news', 'Economic policy'];"It was between Christmas and new year that Boris Johnson began to worry about the next crisis. In the preceding weeks, Covid had been the big dividing line with his backbenchers as the prime minister wobbled over further restrictions but was chastened by an angry cabinet and a mass rebellion of his MPs over the light-touch plan B measures. But a cost of living crisis has the potential to be the much more serious matter in 2022, and the prime minister told aides he wanted work to begin on what other mitigations for rising energy prices might be necessary. Despite this, Johnson may have thought he had a few weeks’ grace with his backbenchers and friendly newspapers for having decided against new Covid restrictions. That hope was undone in the first press conference of the year when the prime minister stumbled over a question from the Sun over energy bills and the potential to cut VAT – a key Labour demand. When he entered the chamber for prime minister’s questions the following day, Johnson appeared to have come prepared for a victory parade in front of his MPs for allowing a normal Christmas and new year despite surging Covid cases.
But Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, took him immediately to task on inflation, tax rises and heating bills, and the prime minister made a string of errors in response, denying his own words on inflation and twice radically overstating the warm homes discount, saying it was a rather implausible £140 a week. Time and again his backbenchers howled about the pressures their constituents were facing on fuel, food bills and tax rises. One of his key cabinet loyalists, Jacob Rees-Mogg, had gone rogue in a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, asking for the prime minister to reconsider his plans for a national insurance rise in April, which will come just as a revised price cap is likely to drastically push up energy bills. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is not minded to pursue major interventions. And Johnson’s problem is that many of the options open to him will fall short. Of what has been suggested so far, such as an extension of the warm homes discount or even a VAT cut on bills, nothing is likely to make much of a dent in the eye-watering rises consumers are likely to see.
The cost of living crisis has the potential to be immensely damaging politically in a number of ways. Many voters who are not especially vulnerable will now care more about a sky-high energy bill than catching Covid. Labour can draw stark parallels with the start of Johnson’s time in No 10. When voters ask themselves whether they feel better or worse off, for many the answer will be the latter. MPs privately say the opposition has a chance to inflict real damage on this issue, rather than on sleaze scandals or rows over Covid restrictions, both of which can sway disgruntled voters midterm but may not ultimately be what matters in the polling booth. Crucially, the squeeze on voters’ pockets gives MPs opportunity to attack the government over their pet grievances, whether that is net zero, deregulation, tax rises or failure to be sufficiently enthusiastic about Brexit. Each one can be seen as a remedy and attract a caucus of troublemakers. A popular and deft prime minister could find ways to contain and mitigate the pressures, with the support of his backbenchers. But with more difficult decisions on the pandemic and embarrassments over sleaze and rule-breaking likely to come, Johnson’s reputation is sufficiently damaged within his own party to make the task even harder.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/06/combination-cost-of-living-crisis-covid-spell-trouble-boris-johnson;1
8;8;5248;5248;FA defends use of VAR at only nine of 32 third-round Cup ties;2022-01-06T13:38:47Z;['Paul MacInnes'];['FA Cup', 'The FA', 'Video assistant referees (VARs)', 'Football', 'Sport'];"The Football Association is to proceed with a plan to use VAR at only nine of 32 FA Cup third-round fixtures, believing the benefits of using the technology outweigh inconsistency in the way ties could be decided. Only matches played at Premier League grounds will have video refereeing because the FA Cup is not licensed to use VAR across all its fixtures. This means that West Bromwich Albion’s tie against Brighton on Saturday will not use the technology despite it being installed at the Hawthorns and there will not be uniformity in the refereeing.
The FA Cup has used VAR since 2018, when it became the first competition in England to implement it as part of a trial. The FA has never applied for a full licence to use the technology, however, which must be agreed with the football lawmaking body Ifab. Last season VAR was used only at ties where Premier League clubs were at home up to the quarter-finals, where all matches were then licensed. The FA has not yet taken a decision on whether to license later rounds this season. The FA is aware of questions over a potential imbalance in sporting standards but is reluctant to increase the running costs of the tournament, with clubs not licensed having to install the necessary minimum of four cameras and costs having to be covered to operate them and hire the necessary officials. “Video assistant referees provide match officials with additional support and should be utilised wherever possible,” the FA said. “However, only Premier League stadiums are currently licensed to use VAR due to the infrastructure, workforce and costs that are required.”
The Premier League introduced VAR permanently at the start of the 2019-20 season. The EFL opted against doing the same owing to cost, but five Championship clubs have the technology after seasons in the top flight. Reports have suggested some Championship clubs want the league to adopt “VAR light”, a scaled-down system approved for trials by Ifab.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/06/fa-cup-defends-var-nine-of-32-third-round-ties;4
9;9;5249;5249;Met investigating Tory peer Michelle Mone over ‘racist message’;2022-01-06T13:28:16Z;['David Conn'];['UK news', 'Michelle Mone'];"The Conservative peer Michelle Mone is being investigated by the Metropolitan police for an allegedly racist message she is accused of sending to a man of Indian heritage. The recipient of the message, Richard Lynton-Jones, complained to the police last summer that during a disagreement following a fatal yacht collision in 2019, Lady Mone told him in a WhatsApp message he was “a waste of a man’s white skin”. Lynton-Jones gave a statement to the police in October, providing screenshots of the messages. He is understood to have told the police in his statement that he believed Mone racially attacked him by using those words in the message, that he found it grossly offensive and felt harassed, alarmed and distressed by it. The alleged contents of WhatsApp messages, in which Mone also allegedly described Lynton-Jones’s partner as a “mental loony” and “nut case bird”, were revealed by the Guardian last month. Mone has repeatedly denied she is racist and her lawyers have questioned the authenticity of the messages. In screenshots of the messages seen by the Guardian, Mone appears to accuse Lynton-Jones and his partner of showing insufficient respect following the yacht crash off Monaco, in which a crew member was killed – an accusation they reject. The WhatsApp screenshots show the Tory peer responding after Lynton-Jones told her to back off, writing: “Your [sic] a low life, a waste of a mans [sic] white skin so don’t give us your lies. Your [sic] a total disgrace.” The Metropolitan police confirmed they were investigating. “In June 2021 police received an allegation of a racially aggravated malicious communication in relation to information posted on a messaging app,” they said in a statement. “Police spoke to the complainant and advised that for the investigation to progress a statement would need to be taken; for this to be admissible in any future court proceedings, this would need to be done in person. ”In October, the complainant gave a statement to police and the investigation continues. A 50-year-old woman has been invited to attend for an interview under caution at a future date.” Mone is understood to have been scheduled to be interviewed under caution on 23 December, but that appointment was reportedly delayed. The police declined to say when the interview was now scheduled to happen.
When the Guardian first reported on the allegedly racist message, a representative of Mone initially said: “Baroness Mone is 100% not a racist. Baroness Mone and her husband have built over 15 schools in Africa in the past three years.” Her lawyers later provided another statement in which they said Mone had “no access” to the messages and no “detailed memory of them”. “She is not prepared to comment on the messages unless and until their authenticity has been confirmed but Baroness Mone, in any event, very strongly denies that she is a racist, a sexist or that she has a lack of respect for those persons genuinely suffering with mental health difficulties.”
In separate correspondence, her lawyers also said their client believed at the time that the man had “no trace whatsoever of non-white colouring or any features” that would suggest he was not “100% white and British”. In a subsequent post on Instagram, Mone denied the WhatsApp message was racist, saying: “Since when did calling out a man on his actions after a manslaughter and his entitled white privilege constitute racism?” A lawyer for Mone indicated to the Guardian that Mone’s Instagram post did not suggest she now accepted that she sent the message. It has since been reported that Lynton-Jones has started libel proceedings against Mone, accusing her of defamation. Mone is reported to have said to friends she will vigorously defend any action. It is understood that there has been no finding of manslaughter following the yacht crash, and that part of the investigation has been closed.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/met-investigating-tory-peer-michelle-mone-over-racist-message;1
10;10;5250;5250;‘Poor meat and ill-treated animals’: Spain in uproar over minister’s remarks;2022-01-06T13:24:28Z;['Stephen Burgen'];['Spain', 'Meat industry', 'Farming', 'Cattle', 'Europe', 'Climate crisis', 'Environment', 'World news', 'Meat'];"Claims by a Spanish government minister that factory farming is damaging the environment and leading to the export of poor-quality meat have provoked a furious backlash after his comments were published in the Guardian. In an interview published on Boxing Day, Alberto Garzón, the minister for consumer affairs, defended traditional grazing “as an environmentally sustainable means of cattle farming”. “That is sustainable; what isn’t at all sustainable is these so-called mega-farms,” he said. “They find a village in a depopulated bit of Spain and put in 4,000, or 5,000 or 10,000 head of cattle. They pollute the soil, they pollute the water and then they export this poor-quality meat from these ill-treated animals.” Garzón is the coordinator of the United Left party, a junior member of the coalition government led by the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez’s, centre-left Socialist Workers party (PSOE).
His remarks have provoked outrage from the meat industry, opposition politicians and from senior members of the PSOE, forcing the government to distance itself from his comments. Isabel Rodríguez, the government spokesperson, said Garzón was speaking in a personal capacity. She added that the livestock industry was “an absolute priority” for the government and praised the “extremely high quality” of its produce. Far from contrite, Garzón rejected the claim that he was speaking on his own behalf. “What I said, I said as the minister of consumer affairs. There’s no other way of seeing it,” he said a radio interview with Cadena Ser, adding that his comments were “flawless”. “I’m not saying anything new,” he told the station. “I’m just relaying what scientists say. Everyone knows that the factory farming of meat causes pollution … and emits greenhouse gases. Europe has brought a case against Spain over the excessive level of nitrate pollution.” Garzón also pointed out that while the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition recommends people eat between 200g and 500g of meat a week, the average Spaniard consumes more than 1kg. Pedro Barato, the president of the Asaja agricultural association, accused Garzón of irresponsible behaviour and called for his resignation. “The Spanish livestock industry depends on exports to survive,” he said. “You can’t send out this sort of message in the international press.” Álvaro Mateos Amann, the president of the Basque veterinary association in Vizcaya, also demanded Garzón’s resignation, saying that the comments by what he called the “pseudo-minister” were another demonstration of “the poor quality of our political representatives and their lack of respect for the livestock sector”. The centre-right Citizens party said in a statement that “in a single paragraph” Garzón had caused “irremediable” damage to Spain’s livestock industry, while Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative People’s party, said it was “unacceptable that the government should tell the international press that Spain exports poor-quality meat from ill-treated animals”. A report published in October said that intensive pork farming probably played a major role in one of Spain’s biggest environmental disasters that led to the death of thousands of fish in the Mar Menor, a saltwater lagoon in south-east Spain. Scientists blame decades of nitrate-laden runoffs from the farms for triggering vast blooms of algae that deplete the water of oxygen, causing the fish to suffocate underwater. According to government figures, in 2021 there were 32 million pigs in Spain, in addition to seven million cows and 15 million sheep and goats. Garzón was previously attacked in July for urging Spaniards to reduce their meat consumption. “This doesn’t mean that we can’t have a family barbecue from time to time, just that we do it with a bit more restraint,” he said. “Eating too much meat is bad for our health and for the planet.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/spanish-minister-under-fire-after-mega-farm-claims-in-guardian;3

Hex, a new version of Sleeping Beauty, began preview performances in the Olivier theatre in December and company illnesses meant that almost every performance in its first week had a different combination of understudies and stand-ins, said Norris in a statement on Thursday. Three weeks of performances were then lost due to illness. The original press night was set for 15 December then postponed to 21 December and then postponed again. “We had hoped to emerge into a clearer situation in January,” continued Norris, who is also the National’s artistic director, “but while we have started performances again, fresh cases are still emerging and the creative team have had to disperse to other projects.” The planned NT Live broadcast has been cancelled.
Hex will end, as planned, on 22 January but the National has announced that it will restage the musical in November “to give it the chance to have a full run” and an official opening night. Norris said that “it will take us a long while to understand the full and ongoing impact of Covid, and we will no doubt be in a state of constant adaptation for some time yet”. Last month, the National also cancelled performances of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time at Troubadour Wembley Park theatre. Over the Christmas period, productions around the UK were beset by last-minute cancellations and postponements caused by Covid-related absences in what is usually theatre’s most profitable period. The new West End musical Moulin Rouge! has also postponed its opening night more than once due to Covid. Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new musical, Cinderella, has suspended performances until next month to “avoid more disruption and to protect the quality of the show we give our audiences” after the impact of the Omicron variant. On Tuesday it was announced that this year’s Vault festival, the London fringe spectacular comprising 600 shows, has been cancelled. It was due to start later this month. In December, a highlights audio recording for Hex, billed as a “mythic, big-hearted musical”, was released. Hex stars Rosalie Craig and has music by Jim Fortune and a book by Tanya Ronder whose plays include Dara and who is married to Norris. It has been an unprecedented time in theatre, added Norris, who said “I certainly have never made a production without an opening night”. In November 2020, the National’s production Death of England: Delroy both opened and closed on the same night as England entered its second national lockdown.";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/06/hex-national-theatre-cancels-opening-night-musical;5

Ferrier pleaded not guilty to the single charge on Thursday morning at Glasgow sheriff court. The Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP, who referred herself to the police and the parliamentary commissioner for standards , was immediately suspended from her party after the alleged rule-breaking came to light. She has clung to her position despite vociferous and ongoing calls for her to quit, including from the first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon. Prosecutors allege Ferrier “culpably and recklessly” put people at risk, making several journeys after having been told to self-isolate between 26 and 29 September 2020. The charge claims she wilfully exposed people to “the risk of infection, illness and death”, travelling throughout Glasgow and the surrounding areas as well as making journeys to and from London. Over three days, the 61-year-old is alleged to have visited a variety of local businesses and other locations within her constituency and beyond, including Lifestyle Leisure Centre, Vanilla Salon and Sweet P Boutique in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, St Mungo’s church in Glasgow and Vic’s bar in Prestwick, Ayrshire. The trial date was set for 15 August, with the case expected to last for four or five days, and a pre-trial hearing set for June. The prosecutor Mark Allan told the court: “Due to the pandemic, the trial will not be fixed for a number of months.

13;13;5253;5253;Energy boss says UK must find £20bn to ease soaring household bills;2022-01-06T13:00:09Z;['Rob Davies'];['Energy industry', 'Energy bills', 'Business', 'Consumer affairs', 'Household bills', 'Money', 'Gas', 'Commodities'];"The boss of one of the UK’s fastest-growing energy suppliers has said Britain must find £20bn to rein in soaring household bills that have compounded fears about a cost-of-living crisis in 2022. Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, said his company did not know yet how much bills would rise in the run-up to 7 February, the deadline for when the regulator Ofgem sets a new cap on what suppliers can charge customers. The record wholesale gas prices across Europe has led to forecasts that average annual bills in the UK could leap from £1,277 to more than £2,000 when the cap comes into effect in April. Jackson said talks between energy suppliers and the government would have to find a way to avoid global gas prices being passed directly on to consumers. “We’ve got to recognise that as a result of the pandemic, every sector is asking the Treasury for help and there’s not an infinite supply of money,” he said. “The reality is that the UK buys most of its energy on a global market and we’ve had to pay about £20bn more than usual this year. So, in some way or another, the UK is going to have to pay that money.” Octopus, a renewable energy provider, is one of the fastest-growing companies in the sector, with 3.1m customers. It has been at the heart of industry talks with business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who is said to be determined to avoid bailing out large energy companies. Jackson has been a leading proponent of an alternative £20bn loan scheme, under which a commercial lender makes a fund available that suppliers can dip into in order to refrain from hitting customers with sudden hikes in their energy bills. The suppliers could then pay the lender back over time with the money they make from staggered price increases, cushioning the blow to household finances.
Jackson said the sector should explore the plan, which may need government oversight but not necessarily any state funding, “before we go looking for help from the public purse or elsewhere”. “The energy sector has always had large access to private finance,” he added.
Asked whether a windfall tax should be imposed on North Sea oil companies that have made money from higher gas prices to help fund lower bills, Jackson refused to dismiss the idea. He added that it should be separate from broader efforts to reduce household bills. The expectation of rising gas bills adds to wider fears that 2022 will be characterised by a massive squeeze on the cost of living that could push more people into poverty and upend British politics. UK households face a hit of £1,200 this year, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, with more expensive energy bills piled on top of rising taxes and the effect of stalling wage increases.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/06/octopus-ceo-uk-20bn-household-bills-loan-scheme;2
14;14;5254;5254;Next rings up bumper Christmas but warns of price hikes ahead;2022-01-06T12:59:16Z;['Sarah Butler'];['Next', 'Retail industry', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Online shopping', 'Consumer affairs', 'Money'];"Next rang up £70m more sales than expected over Christmas after a surge in online orders of party dresses and suits but warned that higher clothing prices are on the way as inflationary pressures grow . Next warned of a “tougher environment” for the year ahead with clothing prices set to rise by up to 6% in the autumn after significant increases in the cost of manufacturing, shipping and hiring staff for warehouses, shops and in its technology centres. Simon Wolfson, the chief executive of Next, said: “The key level of uncertainty is the inflationary environment. I have been in business for 30 years and I don’t think I have ever been through another period of economy-wide inflation on this scale. That’s an environment we are going to have to get used to trading in … How well we fare in that environment is difficult to see.” The fashion and homewares chain is the first retailer to report its Christmas trading results, potentially giving an indication of how the high street fared in the biggest sales period of the year. The group said it now expected to make £822m in annual profits, £22m more than previously hoped for and almost 10% ahead of pre-pandemic levels, in its fifth increase in guidance in less than a year.
In the eight weeks to Christmas Day, Next said its sales rose 20% on 2019 – before the Covid pandemic – despite suffering “materially lower” levels of stocks than it had hoped for while its delivery service had struggled because of labour shortages in its warehouses and distribution networks. “The fact that our sales remained so robust in these circumstances is, we believe, testament to the strength of underlying consumer demand in the period,” the company said. Lord Wolfson said the surge in sales of suits, in particular, was “a measure of how little has been bought of those products over the last two years”. The group’s strong performance was underpinned by an 85% surge in full-price online sales compared with 2019 at its Label business, which sells brands such as Ted Baker, Nike and Mint Velvet. Online sales of Next goods in the UK and overseas were also up by more than 30% in the three months to 25 December, while sales in its UK and Irish stores fell 5.4% on 2019. Wolfson said sales in stores had been much better than the 10%-plus fall anticipatedprobably because the high street was beset by very heavy discounting two years ago. “A lot of those [businesses doing the discounting in the past] are not even trading today,” he said. “That’s likely to have helped in [Next] stores.” He added that shoppers had not been significantly deterred from coming into Next shops by the Omicron surge. Next said it was assuming there would not be further disruption fro the pandemic but it was unclear how much it had benefited from shoppers spending their savings built up during lockdowns and whether a return to spending on holidays and other social activities would hit sales of non-essential goods such as clothing. Sales are expected to rise by 7% in the year ahead, with growth slowing significantly in the latter part of 2022 as price rises force down the number of expected purchases. Next expects its prices to increase by almost 4% this spring and summer while the price of its autumn ranges would be 6% ahead of last year because of higher freight and manufacturing costs. The company said that average wages were also set to rise by 5.4% across the group driven by the April increase in the legal minimum wage as well as shortages of warehouse and technology workers.
Richard Lim, the chief executive of Retail Economics, said: “These are mightily impressive results and demonstrate the growing strength of the brand and its agility to operate through the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic.

It’s much slimmer, like a chipolata. Very smoky, with a red pepper flavour. I wouldn’t have this. Score: 5/10 Craig: It’s got spice. The first taste was quite nice, but it’s quite plain. The texture isn’t good. 4/10 GRO sizzlin’ sausages Co-op, £1.45 for six, 350g Craig: I can taste the herbs, but the content is rubbery.

16;16;5256;5256;BBC News hires ITN’s Deborah Turness as chief executive;2022-01-06T12:38:47Z;['Jim Waterson'];['BBC', 'UK news', 'London', 'Media', 'Tim Davie', 'ITN', 'TV news', 'Television industry'];The BBC has hired ITN’s chief executive to lead its news coverage, at a time when the broadcaster is struggling with substantial budget cuts and facing scrutiny over the impartiality of its coverage. Deborah Turness will inherit a newsroom that is halfway through an unpopular two-year restructuring process and has lost hundreds of experienced staff through redundancies and relocations. Its audience remains enormous across the UK and abroad but it is struggling with the transition away from traditional broadcasting formats and is regularly used as punchbag by politicians. Turness said that in an era of digital growth and innovation the BBC’s global reach gave it an edge. She said: “In the UK and around the world there has never been a greater need for the BBC’s powerful brand of impartial, trusted journalism.” She will be paid £400,000 a year – £60,000 a year more than her predecessor, Fran Unsworth. Her job title has also been upgraded from director of news to CEO of BBC News. Her background as an on-the-ground television producer could be helpful when working alongside the BBC director general, Tim Davie, who has no experience making programmes. Turness made her name during a decade-long stint as editor of ITV News, before moving to New York in 2013 to run the sprawling NBC News operation. The first woman to run a major US news network, she faced internal opposition as she dealt with the scandal over NBC host Brian Williams exaggerating claims about his experiences in Iraq. After four years in that job she returned to London to oversee two NBC-backed television channels that struggled to gain traction – a relaunch of Euronews and an abandoned plan to set up an international-focused version of Sky News. Last year Turness returned to ITN – who make news programmes for ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 – as chief executive, in what was perceived by many staff as a homecoming. Nevertheless, Davie persuaded her to jump ship and shape the future of the public broadcaster’s news operation – seeing off competition from internal BBC candidates such as Jonathan Munro and Jamie Angus. Her start date has yet to be confirmed but Turness’s first significant domestic decisions are likely to include finding a replacement for Laura Kuenssberg as political editor and managing the ongoing rotation of prominent on-air presenters. She will also have to work out whether any parts of the BBC’s news output will have to be shut down in order to meet looming budget cuts caused by years of below-inflation licence fee settlements. Any cuts are likely to cause anger among audiences and politicians, at the same time as the corporation tries to work out how to attract younger audiences who increasingly get their news from elsewhere. There are also ongoing issues around the BBC’s attempts to define impartiality in the modern media environment, with internal and external disputes over everything from coverage of transgender issues to Westminster politics and devolution matters.;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/06/bbc-news-hires-itn-deborah-turness-chief-executive;6

Occupation Student Voting record Labour in 2017; Brexit party in the European elections of 2019; Tory in the 2019 general election; Lib Dem in the most recent local elections Amuse bouche James is adamant that nothing amusing or unusual has ever happened to him Charlotte, 27, Wigan
Occupation Statutory children’s social worker Voting record Voted Ukip once and Labour twice Amuse bouche Is in the habit of giving gifts with her face printed on them For starters James I thought she was going to be one of these over-the-top liberals, where every statement is a question. Charlotte Neither of us was what the other expected. We got on more than we thought we would. James I had shish kebab, mango chicken and some other thing … Charlotte We basically got small plates of street food, all kinds of picky bits. James … lemon lollipops!
The big beef Charlotte James believes in small government, he’s very libertarian. That comes out in a lot of different ways. He went to boarding school, a fee-paying school, so I was giving him a bit of stick. He said, “No, my family aren’t wealthy – it was a school for blind kids. My mum and dad got the local authority to pay for it.” So I said, “How can you say you believe in small government, then, because you would never have got that opportunity?” James I would call myself a libertarian, but I’m not a full-on anarcho-capitalist. Education is different. I’m talking about where the state intrudes into your life – CCTV, privacy issues, Covid restrictions. The cost when it comes to people being able to maximise their economic potential and get forward in life was too high. Charlotte I said to him, “It’s not just about us – it’s about vulnerable people.” And he wasn’t having that. He’s a bit younger. With Covid, my life didn’t change much. His education stopped, his social life stopped.
James I had quite a valuable internship cancelled because of Covid lockdowns. Ironically, it was with the WHO. I felt as if the world had become single track, the only focus was on Covid. Charlotte In lockdown, with my job, I was still in and out of people’s houses, little ones snotting and sneezing; that was scary. Early on, no one had PPE. We were told to avoid face-to-face work if possible but also: “Don’t wear a mask, because the kids will be scared.” James I understood that completely. Obviously some people were in a far higher-risk situation than others.
Sharing plate James I supported leave and I’d vote leave again, but I also think Brexit hasn’t been a good thing for Britain. That’s about the way the government’s handled it – they’ve done it so badly, and it’s caused so many issues for the country, the labour and goods shortages. She didn’t have a problem with goods shortages, because she’s not a fan of massive consumerism.
Charlotte It was funny that we both voted leave. I thought I was going to meet some big remainer. With the labour shortages, wages will have to rise – that was what I hoped to see. I see the EU as a capitalist institution. If somebody’s more well-off, I can see the benefit. If you’re on the bones of your arse, you’re not going to benefit from freedom of movement. James My ideal world would involve no borders between nations in terms of immigration. I saw the EU border system as discriminatory. There has to be a benefit to being an EU member, and one of those benefits has to be preferential treatment. It’s rare I will fall out with someone over politics, because my politics are so weird.
For afters Charlotte We agreed on statues what’s the need to take them down? Nobody’s saying their behaviour was OK, but these people were of their time. But then we’re not people with black heritage. If your ancestors had suffered in the slave trade, you might feel differently. James We’re anti-racist. There should be more explanation of context, but we shouldn’t rush to take them down.
Takeaways James She’s one of the closest people to my political views I’ve found in a long time. We talked for so long, we went to the pub down the road. Charlotte We’re a bit nerdy – we’re interested in stuff other people aren’t. • James and Charlotte ate at Bombay Brew, Rochdale Want to meet someone from across the divide?

The Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) said on Thursday it had fined Google a record €150m for making it difficult for internet users to refuse cookies – small text files that build up a profile of a person’s web activity for commercial purposes. It fined Facebook €60m for the same reason.
Internet users’ prior consent for the use of cookies is a key pillar of the EU’s data privacy regulation, and a top priority for the CNIL. “When you accept cookies, it’s done in just one click,” said Karin Kiefer, CNIL’s head of data protection and sanctions. “Rejecting cookies should be as easy as accepting them.” The watchdog said the facebook.com, google.fr and youtube.com websites did not allow the easy refusal of cookies. Citing the example of Facebook, it said: “Several clicks are required to refuse all cookies, as opposed to a single one to accept them.” It said the companies had three months to comply with its orders, including making it easier for French users to decline cookies, or face extra penalty payments of €100,000 for every day of delay. A Google spokesperson said: “People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the CNIL in light of this decision.” A spokesperson for Facebook’s parent company, Meta, said: “We are reviewing the authority’s decision and remain committed to working with relevant authorities. Our cookie consent controls provide people with greater control over their data, including a new settings menu on Facebook and Instagram where people can revisit and manage their decisions at any time, and we continue to develop and improve these controls.” In 2020, the CNIL strengthened consent rights over ad trackers, saying websites operating in France should keep a register of internet users’ refusal to accept cookies for at least six months. It also said internet users should be able to easily reconsider any initial agreement concerning cookies via a weblink or an icon that should be visible on all pages of a website.";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/06/france-fines-google-and-facebook-210m-over-user-tracking-cookies;6
19;19;5259;5259;Guardiola and Dyche sidelined from FA Cup ties after Covid positives;2022-01-06T12:16:21Z;['Andy Hunter'];['Manchester City', 'Burnley', 'FA Cup', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Manchester City’s preparations for their FA Cup third-round trip to Swindon Town have been hampered after the manager, Pep Guardiola, tested positive for Covid-19 in an outbreak at the club. The Spaniard, along with his assistant Juanma Lillo, recorded the positive test on Tuesday and is in isolation. City report that seven players and 14 members of staff are isolating for Covid-related reasons. The assistant coach Rodolfo Borrell will take charge of Friday’s tie.
Borrell said of Guardiola on Thursday: “He is fine. He has the virus but fortunately he hasn’t got a lot of symptoms. We are permanently in touch via Zoom call or calls like we normally do. “We have had a Covid outbreak and at the moment with seven players unavailable and 14 staff so there is quite a bit out. We are getting it day by day and we don’t know where it is going to end.” Borrell said City were “mentally prepared” for Friday’s game and, despite the numbers in isolation and an outbreak among the club’s elite development squad too, had no plans to request a postponement. “It has possibly been one of the most easiest lineups we have had to decide,” he said. “We are going to play with the ones we have available. We don’t really have much more. Our aim is to keep playing. At this moment we can fill the team. It’s an easy lineup to decide but I don’t know what will happen in the following days. We will play with what we have got, some first-team players and some players from our second team.” Meanwhile, Sean Dyche will miss Burnley’s FA Cup tie against Huddersfield on Saturday after testing positive for coronavirus. “Burnley Football Club can confirm manager Sean Dyche will miss this weekend’s FA Cup third-round tie at home to Huddersfield, after testing positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday,” a tweet said. “Sean will now follow the mandatory self-isolation protocols.” Dyche’s assistant Ian Woan later said he believed there were also four new coronavirus cases among the players.
Dyche and Guardiola are the latest Premier League managers to miss a match because of the virus. In recent weeks Aston Villa’s Steven Gerrard, Newcastle’s Eddie Howe, Crystal Palace’s Patrick Vieira, Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta and Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp have had to stay away from games. Liverpool, who had their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Arsenal on Thursday postponed because of a Covid outbreak, currently have no plans to request the postponement of Sunday’s FA Cup tie at home to Shrewsbury. Liverpool closed down their first-team training facility on Wednesday and will review whether to reopen on Friday.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/06/covid-fa-cup-sean-dyche-burnley;4
20;20;5260;5260;Bruce Willis films – ranked!;2022-01-06T12:15:51Z;['Ryan Gilbey'];['Bruce Willis', 'Film', 'Culture', 'Die Hard', 'Pulp Fiction', 'Action and adventure films'];"20. Surrogates (2009) This futuristic thriller about “surries” – artificial doubles who do the dirty work while their owners stay home – could have had heaps more fun riffing on the disparity between the grizzled older Willis and his blond synthetic doppelganger. Still, it is nice to see him bristling with Rosamund Pike, who plays his glassy wife, and being reunited briefly with his Pulp Fiction nemesis Ving Rhames. 19. The Sixth Sense (1999) Good performance, bad movie. Willis does subtle, judicious work as the child psychologist drawn into the confidences of a boy (Haley Joel Osment) who can see the dead around him. M Night Shyamalan’s sentimental ghost story sinks under the weight of life lessons about emotional closure, and a twist that renders laughable the action of the preceding 100 minutes.
18. Unbreakable (2000) In his second consecutive film with Shyamalan, Willis again produces moving results from portentous, low-grade material. There are shades of Christopher Walken in The Dead Zone in his portrayal of an ordinary Joe baffled by his extraordinary powers. He reprised the role briefly in Split (2016) and at length in Glass (2019). 17. The Siege (1998) Nearly three years before 9/11, writer-director Edward Zwick imagined a terrorist cell launching an attack on US soil. (Post-9/11, Zwick was one of the Hollywood figures consulted by the Pentagon on counter-terrorism matters.) Rightly criticised for the insensitive handling of its Arab characters, the film has some fruitful tension between Denzel Washington, urging caution, and Willis, personifying gung-ho military might. 16. The Last Boy Scout (1991) Misogyny runs through this nasty piece of action cinema from Lethal Weapon screenwriter Shane Black and the director of Top Gun, Tony Scott. What charm it has can be attributed solely to Willis, handling the wisecracks with aplomb as a former secret service agent turned private eye, and Damon Wayans as the ex-NFL star with whom he teams up.
15. Looper (2012) The thrill of seeing Willis working with an exciting young director (Rian Johnson) in this time-loop thriller, in which he and Joseph Gordon-Levitt play the same assassin at different ages, was dulled only slightly by the fact that he had ridden that merry-go-round before in 12 Monkeys. At least he seems more at ease here than steeped in the whimsy of Wes Anderson (who cast him in the same year’s Moonrise Kingdom). 14. Billy Bathgate (1991) Robert Benton’s gangster yarn kicks off with Willis facing death in a bow tie and tux. But what a way to go: Dustin Hoffman orders the execution, Steve Buscemi ties him up, Nicole Kidman looks on aghast. You’ve heard of “Garbo Laughs!” Prepare for something almost as rare: “Willis Weeps!” 13. Mortal Thoughts (1991) In the same year, Willis was once again killed off quickly by a quality film-maker – Alan Rudolph this time (who later directed him in a jumbled 1999 adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut’s Breakfast of Champions). Other bad-guy movie roles followed but Mortal Thoughts was his first: he plays a lout whose wife (Glenne Headly) plots his demise. Willis’s then-spouse Demi Moore is her bestie. 12. Fast Food Nation (2006) In Richard Linklater’s film of Eric Schlosser’s McIndustry exposé, Willis has a cameo as the VP of fictional burger chain Mickey’s, who shrugs off the discovery that his restaurant’s patties contain faecal matter. “We all have to eat a little shit from time to time,” says the owner of modern cinema’s finest shit-eating grin.
11. Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995) This threequel is the wildest of the four further adventures of John McClane, thanks to a killer opening 40 minutes in which he is sent zigzagging across New York on a string of perilous errands. Jeremy Irons, as the taunting brother of the original film’s villain, pulls the strings; Samuel L Jackson comes to the rescue. 10. The Player (1992)/What Just Happened? (2008) Bruce plays Bruce in this brace of Tinseltown comedies. In Robert Altman’s Hollywood comeback, Willis’s death-row rescue of Julia Roberts (“Traffic was a bitch”) at the end of the film-within-a-film signals the ultimate compromise. Meanwhile, in Barry Levinson’s adaptation of Art Linson’s memoir, Willis throws a tantrum when producer Robert De Niro asks him to shed his lovingly cultivated beard – a scene based on Linson’s real-life standoff with Alec Baldwin. 9. 16 Blocks (2006) Willis sports a bristly ’tache and extra worry lines as Jack Mosley, the sad-sack cop accompanying a murder witness to court. If only he had seen Clint Eastwood in The Gauntlet, Jack would realise that this is no cakewalk: bent cops with itchy trigger fingers are out to ruin his day. The lively rapport between Willis and Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def) makes this more fun for us than it is for the characters.
8. Last Man Standing (1996) Walter Hill’s Yojimbo remake casts Willis in the Toshiro Mifune role of the bodyguard-mercenary caught between two warring gangs. It is interesting to see him squaring off against Christopher Walken: not only are the two men diametrically opposed in acting style (Walken’s ostentatious quirkiness meets Willis’s shrugging resignation) and appearance (sharp angles versus doughy softness), but they had also recently played played characters connected across a generation by a gold watch in Pulp Fiction. 7. Bandits (2001) Willis is the stickup merchant who will lay on the charm even when he’s carjacking you (“Ma’am? Don’t forget your purse!”). He and partner-in-crime Billy Bob Thornton – nicknamed the Sleepover Bandits for their habit of moving in with the bank manager the night before a robbery – acquire a third wheel in the shape of Cate Blanchett. Highlights include her and Willis bonding over their mutual love of Total Eclipse of the Heart. 6. In Country (1989) Rising 1980s Brit star Emily Lloyd is the fatherless teen living with her uncle Emmett (Willis), a droopy-moustached Vietnam veteran prone to battlefield flashbacks. “Some think he’s gonna snap,” say the townsfolk, and Willis does well this early in his career to suggest unreachable corners of a damaged psyche. “There’s something missing and I can’t get it back,” he confesses movingly as his niece cradles him in the woods.
5. Pulp Fiction (1994) As the coiled slugger who is too proud to throw a fight, Willis has never been sexier than when he is purring silly sweet nothings to his “lemon pie” (Maria de Medeiros) as they hide out in a hotel room. Nor has he been more intimidating than when his mood flips a few moments later. Quentin Tarantino compared Willis to Sterling Hayden and Robert Mitchum, calling him “the only contemporary actor who suggests the 1950s”. 4. 12 Monkeys (1995) Terry Gilliam refused to allow Willis’s entourage on the set of this La Jetée-inspired brain-scrambler, and banned him from drawing on his usual repertoire of smug smirks. The result was an impressively destabilised performance from a man who tends not to do vulnerable. He plays a time-traveller escaping a future in which 99% of civilisation has been wiped out. Gilliam later said that Willis wanted “to show that he was a real actor”. Mission accomplished.
3. Nobody’s Fool (1994) Willis is sublime as part of the flawless ensemble cast in Robert Benton’s acutely observed small-town comedy. He plays Carl Roebuck, an ornery, philandering construction boss engaged in a war of attrition with his occasional employee (Paul Newman), who wants compensation for a workplace injury. Willis raises his game to match Newman, Melanie Griffith, Jessica Tandy and a young Philip Seymour Hoffman while still exuding effortlessness. Try hard? It doesn’t show. 2. The Fifth Element (1997) Breezy abandon with a top note of irascibility has long been Willis’s brand. Even so, he has rarely enjoyed himself as visibly, or had such a transformative effect on the rest of a movie, as he does in Luc Besson’s nutty science-fiction escapade. As a cab-driving everyman, his muddy platinum dye-job and clinging tangerine Gaultier vest show him at his most swoon-worthy. His chemistry with Chris Tucker (replacing Prince in the squealing sidekick role) is a special delight.
1. Die Hard (1988) If Moonlighting, the TV romcom on which Willis jousted winningly with Cybill Shepherd, represented the foundations on which his persona was built, then the first and finest Die Hard movie was the skyscraper that lifted it into the realm of the heavenly. As John McClane, the New York cop rolling his eyes at airy-fairy Los Angelenos, he would have had an appealing Sunday-morning sluggishness in any context. Stick him in a high rise, held hostage during Christmas party season, and he brings fresh comic sparkle to the shoot-’em-up genre. Head baddie Hans Gruber (a delectable Alan Rickman) mistakes McClane for a Rambo figure, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Unlike Stallone’s brute, McClane isn’t gleeful about wreaking carnage; he would rather be having a brew in front of the TV. But if he really must bring down a crack team of terrorists singlehandedly, he’ll give it his all. Within 15 minutes of the opening credits, Willis is already wearing his trademark singlet, squint and lopsided smirk – the equivalent of Chaplin’s bowler hat, cane and moustache. Once the vest is caked with grime and gore, he is bare-chested, the dad-bod gleaming with sweat, the receding bedhead giving new hope to slobs and baldies alike. Yippee-kai-yay!";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/bruce-willis-films-ranked;5
21;21;5261;5261;Minister vows to close ‘loophole’ after court clears Colston statue topplers;2022-01-06T12:14:01Z;['Aubrey Allegretti'];['Bristol', 'Grant Shapps', 'Culture', 'Heritage', 'Law', 'Protest', 'Politics', 'Slavery', 'UK news', 'World news', 'Statues', 'Art and design', 'Black Lives Matter movement', 'Race', 'Colonialism', 'England'];"Britain is not a country where “destroying public property can ever be acceptable”, a cabinet minister has said, as Conservative MPs vented their frustration at four people being cleared of tearing down a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said the law would be changed to close a “potential loophole” limiting the prosecution of people who damage memorials as part of the police, crime, sentencing and courts (PCSC) bill. Four people – Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22 and Jake Skuse, 33 – were prosecuted for pulling down the statue during a Black Lives Matter protest on in June 2020. A further six were given “restorative justice” outcomes and ordered to pay a £100 fine, undertake unpaid work and fill in a questionnaire about their actions. Shapps said the PCSC bill would ensure that people “can’t just go round and cause vandalism, destroy the public realm, and then essentially not be prosecuted”.
Under current legislation, criminal damage can attract a sentence of up to 10 years in jail. But where the damage is less than £5,000, the maximum sentence is three months’ imprisonment and a fine of up to £2,500. However the new bill, which is being scrutinised by parliament, would let courts consider the “emotional or wider distress” caused by damage to public property, and raise the maximum sentence to 10 years regardless of the costs incurred. The move would extend to flowers or wreaths placed at memorials, such as at a gravestone or the Cenotaph. Shapps avoided contradicting the jury’s decision, acknowledging that they had “seen all the facts”, but he added: “As a broader point, I would say we’re not in a country where destroying public property can ever be acceptable.
“We live in a democratic country. If you want to see things changed you can get them changed, you do that through the ballot box, or petitioning your local council, etc. You don’t do it by going out and causing criminal damage. “We’ll always be on the side of the law and when necessary we will fix any loopholes in the law to make sure that’s always the case.” Robert Jenrick, another Tory MP and former cabinet minister, tweeted: “We undermine the rule of law, which underpins our democracy, if we accept vandalism and criminal damage are acceptable forms of political protest. They aren’t. Regardless of the intentions.” The view was echoed by other Conservative backbenchers. Lee Anderson said people should not use “mindless thuggish behaviour” if they were “offended by a statues” and instead “use the local democratic process to have them removed”. Tom Hunt, a vice-chair of the parliamentary Common Sense Group, said he was “deeply concerned by the precedent set here”, warning it “could give the green light for all sorts of political extremists to take matters into their own hands, shun the democratic processes for removing certain statues and to ransack our past”. One of the defendants, Graham, denied that toppling the Colston monument set a precedent for people to start pulling down statues. Speaking to Good Morning Britain, she said: “I completely understand people’s concerns and I really don’t think this is a green light for everyone to just start pulling down statues. “This moment is about this statue in this city in this time. I will leave the fate of monuments in other cities to the citizens of those cities.” Elsewhere the TV historian and author David Olusoga, who gave expert evidence for the defence during the trial, said the verdict showed that the jury were trying the case of the evidence and not the “culture war” around it. Speaking to Good Morning Britain, he said the jury had considered the information “directly rather than through tabloids or journalists or politicians”, enabling them to “actually react to the evidence rather than to the culture war drum beat that is built around it”. He continued: “Most people don’t understand the details of this history, of this statue, and the long campaign to have it removed peacefully. That statue standing there for 125 years was validating the career of a mass murderer. “And to people whose ancestors were enslaved by Colston and men like him, it is offensive, and you can talk to thousands of people in Bristol who found it offensive.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/minister-grant-shapps-crackdown-court-colston-four-statue;1
22;22;5262;5262;‘I wanted to be a nuisance’: the riotous rise of Hull Truck;2022-01-06T12:10:39Z;['N/A'];['Theatre', 'Hull Truck theatre', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Hull', 'UK news'];"I moved to Hull in 1971 because it was the most unlikely place in the world to start an experimental theatre company – plus rents were cheap and social security were unlikely to find us any proper jobs. I was 23 and I believed that theatre could change the world. I still do. I wanted to make uncompromising, provocative, funny, tough, sexy plays about people you didn’t see in plays, for people who didn’t go to the theatre. I wanted Hull Truck to be a nuisance. Number 71 Coltman Street was cold and dark. On the ground floor was a room full of broken furniture and feral cats. We lived and rehearsed upstairs. The play Children of the Lost Planet was devised over 12 weeks. It was about a bunch of young people of our age living in Hull and trying to negotiate their way through the minefield of sex and drugs and rock’n’roll – always write what you know about. The winter of 1972 was freezing. We only had a small fan heater and rehearsed under a tent of blankets. The heater blew up so we burnt the broken chairs from downstairs. We bought a clapped-out Morris van for £35 and a lad from the youth theatre stole us a tax disc.
We didn’t have many bookings, possibly because the administration office was the phone box outside. When we performed Children of the Lost Planet in York, the local paper wondered why we wanted to bring such disgusting people to the stage. On the way to our first London show the van broke down and we abandoned it in a pig farm in Gilberdyke. We hitched to the gig with the props and costumes. But we carried on. After Children of the Lost Planet came The Weekend After Next, The Knowledge, Oh What!, Bridget’s House, Ooh La La! and Still Crazy After All These Years. We performed countless kids’ shows, pub shows and musical cabarets. Our quest for always telling the uncomfortable truth often got us into trouble. Ironically The Knowledge getting banned in Manchester proved to be our biggest break. The theatre took exception to a rude line spoken by the ex-biker dope dealer Dooley. The day the show was pulled off there was a rave review in the Guardian, which the next day printed a piece about the ridiculous ban. We loaded up the van and headed straight for the Bush theatre in London where we performed an impromptu showcase gig. The word had got round, and we got a standing ovation. The theatre immediately booked us for a month in November. The run was a sellout.
After that followed grants, wages, a proper van, rave reviews and a telephone. We toured the length of the country garnering accolades and abuse in equal measure. One particular scene from Bridget’s House in 1976 caused a lot of fuss. Bridget (Rachel Bell) and Mo (Cass Patton) are discussing their sex lives. At one point Bridget observes that most men wouldn’t know what a clitoris was if it jumped up and bit them on the leg.
One night in Gainsborough a couple in the audience split up during the scene. He stormed out and drove off into the night. We had to give her a lift home in the truck. That same year we were invited to perform Bridget’s House at the new National Theatre. One of the few people who saw those early plays was a very young Richard Bean. When he told me he was going to write 71 Coltman Street, a dramatised story of Hull Truck, he said I would hate it. I don’t. Richard has written a terrific show. Not a word of it is actually true of course, but he has captured the spirit of what he thinks the spirit of Hull Truck was. That’s not an easy thing to do when most theatres seem to be giving in to neo-puritan censorship and politically confected culture wars. The bargain of real, proper theatre is when a group of human beings on stage get together with a group of human beings in the audience to fearlessly celebrate their human being-ness. Pass it on. 71 Coltman Street is at Hull Truck, 17 February to 12 March.";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/06/hull-truck-theatre-50-years;5
23;23;5263;5263;Kazakhstan unrest: what are the protests about?;2022-01-06T12:05:01Z;['Shaun Walker'];['Kazakhstan', 'South and central Asia', 'World news'];"Unrest in Kazahkstan is continuing, and the president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has called on a Moscow-led security alliance to provide “peacekeeping troops” to help him regain control. With a mobile reception and internet blackout across much of the country, reliable figures on casualties are hard to come by, but there have been violent clashes in Almaty and other cities. Tokayev has promised a ruthless crackdown and blamed “terrorists” trained abroad for the violence. What are the protesters angry about? The protests started at the weekend and were sparked by rising fuel prices in the west of the country. They quickly spread to encompass other regions and turned into a general protest against corruption, poverty and inequality. Protesters are angry with Tokayev and benefactor Nursultan Nazarbayev, who ruled Kazakhstan between independence in 1991 and 2019 and has remained powerful behind the scenes.
What are their demands? The protesters want reform and better standards of living, but they are not coordinated and do not have an overall leader. There are no strong opposition politicians and there is no obvious alternative government in waiting, mainly because the authorities have not allowed any opposition politics in recent years. Where is Nazarbayev now? Nazarbayev has not spoken publicly since the protests started and there are rumours he may have left the country. Protesters in one city pulled down a statue of him. His image as the “leader of the nation”, a personality cult built over years, has unravelled dramatically in a matter of days. What is the CSTO and why is it intervening? The Collective Security Treaty Organization comprises Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. It is a mutual defence pact but is not meant for internal issues. This is probably why Tokayev presented the protests as the work of “terrorists” who had been trained abroad, without giving any detail. How is Russia involved? Kazakhstan shares a long border with Russia and has a sizeable ethnic Russian population. The decision for the CSTO intervention came just as Russia has demanded security talks with the US over Ukraine and amid fears of a Russian intervention there. In the longer term, the situation will be alarming for Vladimir Putin, who may have looked at the “Nazarbayev option” as a way to leave office one day without fearing retribution. What happens next? The situation is extremely unpredictable, and with an internet and telephone blackout across much of the country on Thursday, much remains unclear. With the protest mood far from crushed and Tokayev issuing tough rhetoric, there is the potential for more violence.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/kazakhstan-unrest-what-are-the-protests-about;1
24;24;5264;5264;The Wombats: Fix Yourself, Not the World review – noughties indie returns bigger and brighter;2022-01-06T12:00:02Z;['Alexis Petridis'];['The Wombats', 'Music', 'Culture', 'Pop and rock', 'Indie'];"Scroll down the Wombats’ Spotify page and you come to the section headed “Fans also like”. It features a selection of their mid-00s contemporaries, fellow strivers in the league of what was cruelly dubbed “landfill indie”: the Pigeon Detectives, the Kooks, the Enemy, Scouting for Girls. As everyone knows, fashion is cyclical and this stuff currently lurks at the foot of fortune’s wheel: old enough to seem like yesterday’s news, not old enough to seem appealingly retro. Give it 10 years and they’ll be packing them in at 00s revival festivals, as their Britpop forebears are today, but for now, it’s strictly self-released albums and tours of venues euphemistically described as “intimate”.
By rights, the Wombats should be in the same boat as those bands, more anonymous than their peers (close your eyes and try to visualise frontman Matthew “Murph” Murphy, let alone drummer Dan Haggis), they were dumped by their major label in the same year the NME became a free sheet in the face of slumping sales. But the Wombats’ recent interviews come peppered with unexpected phrases: “their studio in LA”, “forthcoming gig at the O2 Arena” and “produced by Jacknife Lee”, the latter fresh from working with U2. It’s not just that they now play far bigger venues than 15 years ago, it’s that the venues come packed – as every reviewer notes in astonishment – with kids too young to remember the Wombats’ first flush of fame. Last year, their 2015 single Greek Tragedy belatedly went gold in the US: between the original and a subsequent remix by Swedish producer Oliver Nelson in 2020, it’s racked up nearly 175m streams on Spotify. Greek Tragedy’s success was down to one of those weird TikTok blips that makes memes of unexpected songs, but you can’t fill the O2 Arena from a social media trend. Fix Yourself, Not the World provides some convincing explanations. Their relative anonymity appears to have worked in their favour, allowing them to repurpose their sound from the post-punk guitars of Moving to New York and Let’s Dance to Joy Division to something more pop-facing, without incurring the hysterical reactions provoked by, say, Kaiser Chiefs working with Girls Aloud mastermind Brian Higgins: the Wombats didn’t make enough of a lasting initial impression to be accused of cravenly abandoning their roots. With its guitars tethered to dancefloor-focused drums, bass smoothed with electronics and concluding title track an epic synthy ballad, the Wombats’ polished and snappy fifth album won’t shake anyone with its plethora of unanticipated thrills. However, it sounds resolutely like a product of the 2020s rather than a throwback to scrappier era. The moments where it most obviously recalls the mid-00s are its least successful, the leaden glam stomp of Don’t Poke the Bear a case in point.
More prosaically, the Wombats write noticeably better songs than the current crop of artists who labour under the label “indie”. You can detect a degree of experience in their approach: the pounding opener Flip Me Upside Down and the subtly effective rhythmic shifts of Ready for the High are clearly the work of people who’ve done enough gigs to know what provokes a huge audience to jump up and down. The choruses are bigger and brighter – there’s a particularly great example on This Car Drives All By Itself – while the hooky immediacy of their melodies makes their recent TikTok trendsetter status less of a mystery than first appeared. So do the lyrics. They come unstuck when they feel obliged to tackle big issues – Work Is Easy, Life Is Hard offers a lumpy excoriation of cancel culture – but they’re good at one-liners, as evidenced by the title of If You Ever Leave, I’m Coming With You and its depiction of someone trying to rouse themselves from a melancholy, stoned torpor: “I’ll get out of bed / Stop listening to Radiohead.”
The lyrics also have a tendency to sneer at the dictates of fashion. “Fuck your role play / No construction / I’ll build it my own way: no subscribing, no reviews,” sings Murphy on Method to the Madness. And understandably so. That the Wombats’ gigs are apparently filled with teenagers seems less surprising when you consider that said teenagers are too young to remember a time when music wasn’t accessed via the all-encompassing bran barrel of streaming, or when the music press had any gatekeeping power: the notion of a band being hip or déclassé is more of a moot point than it once was. Fix Yourself, Not the World isn’t going to change the face of music, but nor is it going to do anything to impede the Wombats’ latter-day progress. • Fix Yourself, Not the World is released on Awal on 14 January.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/06/the-wombats-fix-yourself-not-the-world-review-awal-noughties-indie-returns-bigger-and-brighter;5
25;25;5265;5265;Manchester United: Richard Arnold to replace Ed Woodward as CEO on 1 February;2022-01-06T12:00:01Z;['Jamie Jackson'];['Manchester United', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Ed Woodward will step down as Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman on 1 February, with Richard Arnold, the group managing director, to replace him as the club’s CEO. Woodward announced last April he would leave his role in the wake of United’s joining of the failed European Super League, though he did not offer a date. Thursday’s news formalises his departure and ends nearly nine turbulent years as United’s most powerful executive, Woodward having superseded David Gill in May 2013.
Woodward endured a fractious relationship with a constituency of fans who blamed him for United’s failure to compete for a 21st title after Sir Alex Ferguson left at the same time as Gill with the club as champions. It is understood Woodward’s greatest regret was Ferguson’s retirement after an unprecedented 26-and-a-half-year reign that included a record 13 Premier League titles. The 50-year-old also accepts that fundamental mistakes were made in the recruitment of players and managers. Woodward believes Louis van Gaal, who was made manager in summer 2014, was given too much freedom to decide signings, and is conscious that United might have been more successful if he had made Pep Guardiola or Jürgen Klopp the No 1. Woodward appointed David Moyes as Ferguson’s successor but the Scot lasted only 34 league games, despite signing a six-year contract, before being sacked. Woodward subsequently recruited Van Gaal, José Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjær, with Solskjær’s replacement, Ralf Rangnick, as interim manager his final appointment. Van Gaal’s 2016 FA Cup and Mourinho’s 2017 League Cup and Europa League triumphs were the major trophies claimed under Woodward, who also sanctioned the £89.3m purchase of Paul Pogba, then a British record.
Joel Glazer, the executive co-chairman, said: “I would like to thank Ed for his tireless work on behalf of Manchester United during his nine years as executive vice-chairman and 16 years with the club. We are now looking forward to Richard and his leadership team opening a new phase in the club’s evolution, with ambitious plans for investment in Old Trafford, the strengthening of our engagement with fans, and continued drive towards our most important objective – winning on the pitch.” Arnold, who was appointed by a process independent of Woodward, said: “I am honoured to have the chance to serve this great club and its fans. I am determined to return that honour in any way I can.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/06/manchester-united-richard-arnold-to-replace-ed-woodward-as-ceo-on-1-february;4

27;27;5267;5267;‘Relight my fire’: Broad says ambition burning again after five-wicket haul;2022-01-06T11:33:38Z;['Ali Martin'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'Stuart Broad', 'The Ashes', 'England cricket team', 'Australia cricket team', 'Australia sport', 'Cricket', 'Sport'];"Stuart Broad declared the fire was burning once more after a five-wicket haul that raised further questions about his peripheral role during England’s failed Ashes bid. The 35-year-old had begun to doubt his international future after a low-key 2021 that was damaged by injury and ended with him missing out on the seamer-friendly pitches witnessed during the defeats at the Gabba and the MCG.
But after his five for 101 on the second day in Sydney helped stem the bleeding as Australia amassed 416 for eight declared, not least with Ben Stokes unable to bowl due to a side strain, such thoughts appeared to have melted away. Broad, who missed the back-end of the summer with a calf injury and dropped below Ollie Robinson in the pecking order, said: “I can’t say I wasn’t disappointed to miss out in Brisbane and Melbourne. But when you miss out in Test matches that actually makes you realise how special it is. “I’ve still got a burning desire to play the sport. I must admit, a few years ago I was umming and aahing and I spent a lot of time talking to my dad [former England opener Chris Broad] about it. He had a great belief that you should play the sport you love for as long as you can, while the fire burns. Because nothing replicates it in life. “I think 2021 was my worst year, with the intermittent cricket – I had a play one, miss one type experience – but bowling today made me relight that fire again. It’s a great stadium, good atmosphere and I’m bowling at the world’s best – this is what it’s about.” Meanwhile Australia’s Usman Khawaja was in an emotional mood after stroking 137 on his return to the side to win a 45th cap. Given a hero’s reception in Sydney, the city where he grew up after his parents emigrated from Pakistan when he was five years old, the left-hander reflected on the wider significance. Khawaja said: “Honestly, it was the most touching, humbling, amazing feeling out there today, getting that hundred and the roar that went up and chanting ‘Uzzie’. It’s stuff you dream of. I never expected that to happen. “To have that it was unbelievable. They talk about the American Dream, I call it the Australian Dream. I joke about it, but I’m quite serious. I’m living the Australian dream.
“My parents came over here from Pakistan to give me and my family a better life. They’ve come all the way out here and I’m representing Australia in the national sport. “I’ve gone through hard times, broken down barriers to get to where I am right now and I think at some level people can relate to that and they can see it, and I love them for it. The love I got out here today is something special and something I’ll never forget.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/06/relight-my-fire-broad-says-ambition-burning-again-after-five-wicket-haul-ashes-cricket;4
28;28;5268;5268;When American democracy crumbles, it won’t be televised | Bhaskar Sunkara;2022-01-06T11:30:01Z;['Bhaskar Sunkara'];['US politics', 'US news', 'US Capitol attack'];"Americans are not exactly known for nuance. Maybe it shouldn’t surprise us then that the rightwing protests that turned into a riot at the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021 were immediately described as a coup attempt. For most Democrats, the participants were at the very least insurrectionists guilty of sedition, or perhaps even domestic terrorists. Wall-to-wall coverage at the time on broadcast television and magazine thinkpieces waxing eloquent about the attack on “the people’s house” confirmed the assessment. For establishment Republicans, the protesters were the worst slur they could think of: they were “foreign”. George W Bush compared them to people in a “banana republic” and the Republican congressman Mike Gallagher agreed that “we are witnessing absolute banana republic crap in the United States Capitol right now.” The Florida senator Marco Rubio described the events in a tweet as “3rd world style anti-American anarchy”. But despite all the fears, the pro-Trump rioters on 6 January didn’t exactly look like hardened fascists. Most wandered disorganized to the Capitol, looked on from a distance, took selfies and then trotted back to their hotel rooms after they got bored. These weren’t the street fighters we’ve come to associate with the rise of the far right internationally. Perhaps the strongest sign that the United States wasn’t actually in danger of falling to fascism that day was the response to 6 January from American elites. It is well established that big business interests have historically aligned both with fascism, as was the case in the 1930s, and rightwing authoritarianism, and authoritarianism more generally, during moments of crisis. As the Columbia law professor Tim Wu wrote in his recent book on monopolies: “The monopolist and the dictator tend to have overlapping interests.” Trump, of course, has something in common with fascists. He uses mass communications to stoke already widespread disaffection, directing anger not at economic power brokers but at minorities and perceived cultural elites. He has encouraged violence and threats of violence against his enemies, culminating in the mobilization one year ago today.
But what he didn’t have was elite buy-in. Trump gave business what it wanted while he was in power, deregulating and cutting taxes while keeping the power of labor in check. But unlike in 1920s Italy or 1930s Germany, major commercial interests didn’t feel nearly threatened enough by workers’ organizations and the left to allow the president to overturn democratic norms. Indeed, by 6 January, they seemed to see an unstable White House as a bigger threat to their profits. In the aftermath of the Capitol riot, the pro-Trump National Association of Manufacturers called for the president to be impeached. The highly influential Business Roundtable, which represents the country’s largest corporations, issued a condemnation of the actions almost as strong. Finance capital, that great historic ally of fascism in its initial variant, wasn’t too far behind. Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said on 6 January itself: “Our elected leaders have a responsibility to call for an end to the violence, accept the results, and, as our democracy has for hundreds of years, support the peaceful transition of power.” None of this is to impute intrinsic democratic motives to the American elites. They are, after all, helping to bankroll gerrymandering efforts across the country that dilute democracy and skew results in their favor. They are pouring in millions to support the campaigns of politicians who would roll back voting rights. And they are rallying their resources to oppose legislation that would give working-class people greater power in the economy. But, for all their anti-democratic efforts, they are far from ready to openly abandon liberal democratic norms. Why risk the turmoil when their slow dismembering of democracy from the inside is protecting their profiteering even better than shock troops would? In other words, US politics is indeed in crisis – but the crisis is a slow-moving one. It’s not as dramatic as a fascist storming of a Capitol building or a military takeover. But it’s almost as harmful to democracy in the long run. ••• This brings us to the question of institutional reform. In the United States, a party doesn’t just win an election and then govern (either alone or in coalition). Rather, after a successful election they often must deal with a myriad of veto points. Due to the Senate filibuster, 60 votes (derived undemocratically with two senators from each state, including the least populated ones) are necessary to pass most legislation. And in the House of Representatives, the more democratic lower house of the legislature, elections are held every two years, often making it out of sync with Senate elections, held every six years, and presidential elections, held every four years.
A two-party system with this kind of structure all but guarantees that divided government is the norm rather than the exception – and that’s not to mention the role of a powerful judiciary. It was a political arrangement built by America’s founders to muzzle popular passions and ensure elite rule and that changes to the constitution through amendments are almost impossible to bring about. Contrary to myths about American stability, it hasn’t actually worked out that well. In the 19th century, the structure of US government, particularly its devolution of power to states, protected slavery and the power of plantation owners, which led directly to a bloody civil war. In the 20th century, things were more stable, but this required an unusual amount of elite consensus and cross-party cooperation. But that consensus became harder to maintain after the exodus of northern liberals from the Republican party and southern Dixiecrats from the Democratic party created a more ideologically coherent system. We had a center to center-left party incorporating some business interests, as well as the labor movement and a disproportionately racial-minority base of workers, on the one hand, and on the other a rightwing party of business with a solid popular base among conservative southern whites. The resulting level of polarization was not unusual by world standards, but the American political system was uniquely ill-equipped to handle polarization. In a rational system, elections would have consequences, the winning party would be able to govern, and if people disapproved of their actions, they would be voted out to allow the opposition to do the same. In the American system today, elections almost always result in divided government and the opposition can use the system’s many chokepoints to hamper the ruling party’s attempts to govern. It’s no wonder so many Americans lack faith in the ability of politics to change their lives for the better. ••• Polarization has happened in both directions, and as Ezra Klein argues in his 2020 book Why We’re Polarized, we shouldn’t follow standard talking points and denounce it as inherently bad. The anti-democratic political system in the United States functioned only with labor and Black Americans, in particular, muzzled in the last century, and some of the political tension decried by observers is coming from oppressed people asserting their rights and interests more vocally.
However, it’s clear that the Republican party has moved rightward at a much faster speed than the Democrats have moved leftward. Republican distrust of state institutions – reflected both in their skepticism of election results as well as vaccine safety – has grown more intense. Tens of millions of Trump voters justified the 6 January riot at the Capitol, think the 2020 vote was stolen, and fear the same will happen in the 2022 midterms, in which Republicans are expected to make major gains. If Trumpism was the counter-revolution inaugurated by eight years of tepid liberalism under President Obama, what kind of response would a more confident leftwing government inaugurate? That’s a question that every progressive should ask themselves, especially as they attempt to push Biden to become “the new FDR”. After all, we can expect reactionary forces to become even more aggressive if faced with a more assertive leftwing foe. How does one defuse the situation? To begin with, Democrats need to focus less on conjuring nightmares about the future (even if some of those fears are warranted) and more on offering dreams that people can believe in. That means clearer bread-and-butter messaging about the material gains that politics can offer people. They should lead with this program, while being willing to take measures to pursue institutional reform to carry out this program once in power, such as eliminating the Senate filibuster and weakening the power of the courts. The future of US politics is bleak: it’s hard not to imagine, as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp does, continued instability, a lack of trust in elections, a gridlocked Congress, and the growth of extremist groups. 6 January 2021 may have been a riot and not a coup, but there will be far more riots to come until the left figures out a way to resolve the contradictions that plague US society. And if we don’t, the specter of the right breaking the impasse through authoritarian measures will become far more present. For now, however, the problem isn’t that American democracy is about to be overthrown; it’s that America isn’t much of a democracy to begin with. We need to create one people can believe in.

29;29;5269;5269;The insurrection is only the tip of the iceberg | Sidney Blumenthal;2022-01-06T11:29:01Z;['Sidney Blumenthal'];['US Capitol attack', 'Donald Trump', 'Trump administration', 'US politics', 'Republicans', 'The far right'];"After thousands of posts appeared for weeks on a website called TheDonald.win detailing plans for the 6 January attack on the Capitol, including how to form a “wall of death” to force police to abandon defensive positions; after Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, warned his senior aides of “a Reichstag moment” like the 1933 burning of the German parliament that Hitler used to seize dictatorial power; after insurrectionists smashed several ground floor windows of the Capitol, the only ones out of 658 they somehow knew were not reinforced, that allowed rioters to pour inside; after marching to the chamber of the House chanting “Hang Mike Pence!”; after pounding on the locked doors; and as the Capitol police led members in a run through the tunnels under the Capitol for safe passage to the Longworth Building, Congressman Jody Hice, a Republican of Georgia, raced by a Democratic colleague, who told me Hice was screaming into his phone: “You screwed it up, y’all screwed it all up!” (Hice has denied the incident occurred, but the Democratic congressman stands by his account.)
Hice, an evangelical minister, professor of preaching at a Southern Baptist seminary, and radio talkshow host before his election in 2014, has notably declared that freedom of religion should not apply to Muslims and that the Sandy Hook massacre of 26 people at an elementary school by a deranged shooter occurred because liberals were “kicking God out of the public square”. He was tasked to present a challenge to Georgia’s electors before the joint congressional session convened on 6 January to certify the electoral college victory of Joe Biden. Hice performed his assignment as part of the far-rightwing Republican faction, the Freedom Caucus, directed by Congressman Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who was in constant touch that day with Mark Meadows, the Trump chief of staff and former Freedom Caucus member, and a watchful Trump himself. Just as the violent insurrection launched, and paramilitary groups spearheaded medieval style hand-to-hand combat against the police and burst into the Capitol, Hice posted on Instagram a photo of himself headed into the House chamber, with the caption, “This is our 1776 moment.” To whom was Hice shouting that “y’all” had screwed it all up? It seems likely it was Meadows. And what had they screwed up? They had screwed up the coup that led to the insurrection. The insurrection was not the coup itself. It was staged as the coup was failing. The insurrection and the coup were distinct, but the insurrection emerged from the coup. It has been a common conceptual error to consider the insurrection alone to be the coup. The coup, however, was an elaborate plot developed over months to claim that the votes in the key swing states were fraudulent, for Mike Pence as the presiding officer of the joint session of the Congress to declare on that basis that the certification of the presidential election on the constitutionally mandated date could not be done, to force that day to pass into a twilight zone of irresolution, for House Republicans to hold the floor brandishing the endless claims of fraud, to move the decision to the safe harbor of the House of Representatives, voting by states, with a majority of 26 controlled by the Republican party, to deny both the popular vote and the electoral college vote to retain Trump in office, for protests to breakout at federal buildings, and for the president to invoke the Insurrection Act to impose law and order. Presumably, any gesture to forestall the coup by the joint chiefs would be communicated at once to Trump from his agent, Kash Patel, a former aide to far-right representative Devin Nunes), sworn enemy of the “Deep State”, embedded as chief of staff to the acting secretary of defense, and presidential orders would be issued to countermand. The rally on 6 January – “will be wild”, Trump promised – was a last-ditch attempt to intimidate the vice-president with the threat of violence into fulfilling his indispensable role in the coup, to lend support to the Republicans objecting to certification, and to delay the proceedings into a constitutional no man’s land.
The insurrection may also have been intended to provide a pretext for precipitating clashes with anti-Trump demonstrators, following the example of the street violence and multiple knife stabbings perpetrated in Washington by the neo-Nazi Proud Boys chanting “1776” on 12 December, and which would then be an excuse for invoking the Insurrection Act. In the criminal contempt citation of Meadows for his refusal to testify before the select committee investigating the US Capitol attack, the committee noted that Meadows sent an email the day before the assault to an unnamed individual “that the national guard would be present to ‘protect pro-Trump people’ and that many more would be available on standby”. From whom would “pro-Trump people” be protected? In the midst of the attack, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, managed to reach a preoccupied Trump, who was riveted viewing the unfolding chaos on television at the White House, closely monitoring whether the coup would finally succeed, taking phone calls from Jim Jordan and a host of collaborators, and fending off urgent pleas to call it off from his daughter Ivanka. Trump’s first reply to McCarthy was to repeat “the falsehood that it was antifa that had breached the Capitol”, according to the Republican representative Jaime Herrera Beutler. McCarthy argued: “It’s not Antifa, it’s Maga. I know. I was there.” “Well, Kevin,” said Trump, “I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.” “Who the fuck do you think you are talking to?” McCarthy inquired in an uncharacteristic display of testosterone that soon was replaced with his regular order of servility before Trump and Jordan. The absence of antifa, and McCarthy’s refusal in the heat of the moment to lend credence to the phantom menace, may have condemned any false-flag thought of invoking the Insurrection Act. Meanwhile, the bayonet-ready national guard idly awaited orders for hours to quell the actual insurrection.
The coup was thwarted by the justice department’s rejection of Trump’s strong-arm tactics, the Pentagon’s denunciation of any hint of imposing martial law, the rebuff by state election officials to Trump’s claims of fraud, and, finally, Pence’s refusal to utter his scripted lines. At the 6 January rally, Trump said: “I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so. Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.” But Pence had already stated that he would do no such thing. Then, Trump said: “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country any more … So, we’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we’re going to the Capitol …” The insurrection was on. The coup was hardly Trump’s full-blown brainchild. It was packaged for him. It was adapted, enhanced and intensified from longstanding Republican strategies for voter suppression. The coup was a variation on the theme from a well-worn playbook. Trump eagerly grasped for the plan handed to him. More than a year before the election of 2020, in August 2019, conservative operatives in closely connected rightwing organizations began preparing a strategy for disputing election results. A “Political Process Working Group” focused on “election law and ballot integrity” was launched by Lisa Nelson, the CEO of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), heavily funded by the Koch brothers’ dark money syndicate, the Donors Trust. Nelson is also a member of the secretive Council on National Policy (CNP), composed of more than 400 rightwing Republican leaders, a roster that includes Ginni Thomas, the ubiquitous rightwing zealot and wife of supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, and Leonard Leo, vice-president of the conservative Federalist Society and the Judicial Crisis Network, “a $250m dark money operation” to pack the federal courts and deny Democratic appointments to the bench, according to the Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse. The investigative reporter Anne Nelson, in her book Shadow Network: Media, Money, and the Secret Hub of the Radical Right, describes the CNP as a nexus of “the manpower and media of the Christian right with the finances of western plutocrats and the strategy of rightwing Republican political operatives”. A board member of the CNP, Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer at the center of a host of rightwing groups, assumed control over the Alec-originated project and moved it forward. She is also a board member of the Bradley Foundation, which is a major funder of conservative organizations, including Alec and the CNP. Most importantly, she has directed the Bradley Foundation to serve as the chief funder of a group of which she is chairman, the Public Interest Legal Foundation (Pilf), a principal conservative organization seeking to purge voter rolls of minorities and immigrants, file suits that accuse local election officials of “fraud”, and attempt to overturn election results. At a February 2020 meeting of the CNP devoted to election tactics, the Pilf president, J Christian Adams, advised: “Be not afraid of the accusations that you’re a voter suppressor, you’re a racist and so forth.” Mitchell was instrumental in devising the blueprint for the coup. On 10 December 2020, 65 leading members of the CNP signed a succinct step-by-step summary of the completely elaborated plot that went little noticed except on the coup-friendly rightwing website Gateway Pundit: The evidence overwhelmingly shows officials in key battleground states – as the result of a coordinated pressure campaign by Democrats and allied groups – violated the constitution, state and federal law in changing mail-in voting rules that resulted in unlawful and invalid certifications of Biden victories. There is no doubt President Donald J Trump is the lawful winner of the presidential election. Joe Biden is not president-elect. Accordingly, state legislatures in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada and Michigan should exercise their plenary power under the constitution and appoint clean slates of electors to the electoral college to support President Trump. Similarly, both the House and Senate should accept only these clean electoral college slates and object to and reject any competing slates in favor of Vice-President Biden from these states. Conservative leaders and groups should begin mobilizing immediately to contact their state legislators, as well as their representatives in the House and Senate, to demand that clean slates of electors be appointed in the manner laid out in the US constitution.” Mitchell was by then a Trump campaign legal adviser, with direct access to Trump and working on the Georgia challenge to the results. The Trump campaign had filed a lawsuit a week earlier, on 4 December, claiming there were “literally tens of thousands of illegal votes”. On 30 December she sent the petition to Meadows with 1,800 pages of exhibits of supposed fraud, which Meadows promptly forwarded to the acting attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, who was under tremendous pressure from Trump to intervene on his behalf to throw out the election results. “Pure insanity,” the acting deputy attorney general, Richard Donoghue, told Rosen. Meadows pressured Rosen again on 1 January. “Can you believe this?” Rosen wrote Donoghue. “I am not going to respond …” The next day, Trump called the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to instruct him to “find 11,780 votes, which is one more than [the vote deficit] we have, because we won the state”. Cleta Mitchell was on the call with Trump. “Well, Cleta, how do you respond to that? Maybe you tell me?” asked Trump. She accused Raffensperger of withholding records that would prove there were more than 20,000 fraudulent votes and rigged voting machines. “All we have to do, Cleta, is find 11,000-plus votes,” said Trump. On 4 January, Trump brought Pence to the Oval Office to be pressured not to certify the results by a former Chapman University law professor, John Eastman, who was also a director of the Pilf that Mitchell chaired, and had been recruited to play professor to the slow-learning Pence, the Pygmalion of the putsch. Eastman had written a memo, “January 6 scenario”, laying out precisely how Pence should conduct the stoppage of the electoral college count to “create a stalemate that would give the state legislatures more time to weigh in to formally support the alternate slate of electors …” Eastman’s memo filled in stage directions for Pence that followed the well-developed coup plot. All Pence had to do was repeat the lines he was given: the rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain. His general counsel, Greg Jacob, however, informed him that if he obeyed Trump he would “betray his oath to uphold our laws and the constitution of the United States. That was a fool’s errand.”
Trump electors in the swing states had already met on 14 December to prepare to usurp the Biden ones. That day Trump summoned William Barr to the White House to demand his support for claims that the election returns in the swing states were fraudulent. Barr would have undoubtedly been aware of the meeting of the Trump electors rehearsing their part in the coup. Long having done Trump’s bidding from consciously lying about the Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 election to aid Trump onward, he now reached a line he would not cross and told Trump that his assertions of fraud were “bullshit”. And then he resigned. He would have no part of the coup. In came Rosen, who was subjected to rounds of coercion. When Mitchell’s role was disclosed, the Washington law firm of Foley & Lardner where she was a partner forced her to resign on 5 January, the day before the insurrection. She had neglected to tell her partners of her work for Trump. The Senate judiciary committee, in its report, released on 7 October 2021, Subverting Justice: How the Former President and His Allies Pressured DoJ to Overturn the 2020 Election, recommended that Mitchell’s activities “warrant further investigation”. The sweeping nature of the coup, involving Republican operatives, major Republican donors, organizations and members of the Congress is starkly laid out in documents the House investigating committee has obtained under subpoena. The production of documents from Meadows revealed a 38-slide PowerPoint presentation entitled Options for 6 JAN, prepared by Phil Waldron, a retired army colonel expert in psychological warfare and proliferator of conspiracy theories who worked with Trump’s lawyers. Waldron said he spoke with Meadows “maybe eight to 10 times” and briefed members of Congress. Besides reiterating the basic elements of the coup – “VP Pence rejects the electors” – Waldron added that China and Venezuela had “INFLUENCE and CONTROL over US Voting infrastructure in at least 28 States”. He urged that all electronic ballots be declared “invalid” and that Trump should “Declare National Security Emergency”. Bernard Kerik, working with Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani to spin fantasies of fraud, turned over to the House committee under subpoena a document, Strategic Communications Plan, “to educate the public on the fraud numbers” and “to disregard the fraudulent vote count and certify the duly-elected President Trump”. Replete with fallacious assertions (“Fulton County, GA, video of suitcases of fraudulent ballots”), it detailed the extensive reach of the “big lie” campaign, encompassing “Identified Legislative Leaders in each swing state”, legal teams in the key states, and ranked social media influencers to spread the message: “YOU CANNOT LET AMERICA ITSELF BE STOLEN BY CRIMINALS.” Kerik, a convicted felon, guilty of numerous crimes from tax fraud to lying under oath, rose from Giuliani’s driver to New York City police commissioner and incredibly the minister of the interior of Iraq, before serving a four-year sentence in Rikers Island jail. Like convicted felons Mike Flynn and Roger Stone – and Steve Bannon, whose trial for various felonies was ended with a preemptive pardon before a judgment – he was granted a pardon by Trump that allowed him to participate in the coup with impunity. Though under subpoena, Kerik refused to turn over to the House committee a document entitled “DRAFT LETTER FROM POTUS TO SEIZE EVIDENCE IN THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL SECURITY FOR THE 2020 ELECTIONS”. The date on Kerik’s letter, 17 December 2020, was the day that former general Mike Flynn, Trump’s disgraced national security adviser, gave an interview to the far-right Newsmax calling on Trump to “seize every single one” of the voting machines “around the country”, and “take military capabilities” in the key states to “basically rerun an election”. Flynn’s notions were echoed in the Waldron PowerPoint and in the Kerik letter. On 18 December, Flynn met at the White House with Trump at which he proposed invoking the National Emergency Act. (Flynn had circulated a call for “Limited Martial Law To Hold New Election” weeks earlier, on 1 December.) The army secretary, Ryan McCarthy, and the army chief of staff, Gen James McConville, issued a statement on the day Flynn met with Trump disavowing Flynn and any suggestion of martial law. “There is no role for the US military in determining the outcome of an American election,” they stated. The criminal citation of Meadows for contempt from the House committee to the justice department notes that he was in “nonstop” communication “throughout the day of January 6” with Kash Patel at the Pentagon, and “among other things, Mr Meadows apparently knows if and when Mr Trump was engaged in discussions regarding the national guard’s response to the Capitol riot.” The House resolution also references Meadows’ contacts with Republican state legislators, “private individuals who planned and organized a January 6 rally”, and members of Congress prepared to object to the election certification – a panoply of people involved in the coup. The committee also released texts from Fox News personalities to Meadows on 6 January imploring him to get Trump to stop the insurrection. “This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy,” wrote an anxious Laura Ingraham. The familiar relationship suggested the intertwining of Fox News as the chief outlet for Trump messaging about the “big lie” up to the insurrection. But the ties went further.
On 4 January 2022, the House committee requested the voluntary testimony of Sean Hannity as a “fact witness”. The committee wrote him that it had in its possession dozens of texts from Hannity to Meadows “indicating that you had advance knowledge regarding President Trump’s and his legal team’s planning for January 6th”, and “that you were expressing concerns and providing advice to the president and certain White House staff regarding that planning”. On the evening of 5 January, Hannity texted Meadows: “Pence pressure. WH counsel will leave.” He also appeared to have had “a conversation directly with president on the evening of January 5th (and perhaps at other times) regarding his planning for January 6th”. What did Sean Hannity know and when did he know it? When the riot was finally subdued and the Congress reconvened to certify the election, the House Republicans still rose to object. Hice, with QAnon proponent representative Marjorie Taylor Greene standing at his side, declared: “Myself, members of the Georgia delegation and some 74 of my Republican colleagues object to the electoral votes from the state of Georgia on the grounds the election conducted on November 3 was faulty and fraudulent due to unilateral actions by the secretary of state to unlawfully change the state’s election process.”
Of the thousands involved in the Capitol riot, 725 so far have been charged with various crimes. But those sentenced, mostly true believer foot soldiers of the Trump mob, were not the originators of the coup, the most dangerous sedition against the constitutional order since secession. Nor were the leaders of the militias, of the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters, present at the creation. The 6 January attack was a spawn of the coup; it was its effect, not its alpha and omega. Only those incited to sacrifice themselves in the Pickett’s Charge of the insurrection have paid the price, but none of those who conceived the coup a year earlier have been brought before a federal grand jury, charged, or apparently are even being investigated by the Department of Justice. It would be as if only the Watergate burglars were prosecuted and that was the end of the affair. All of the higher-ups involved in the scandal – chief of staff Bob Haldeman, his deputy John Ehrlichman, attorney general John Mitchell, the entire cast of complicit characters and President Richard Nixon – would have remained untouched in power. There will be more to know about the coup from the House investigation. The committee has gathered more than 30,000 documents and interviewed more than 300 witnesses. Two, three, many John Deans may testify before the cameras. Criminal referrals will probably be made. The coup of 2020 gestated within the central organizations of the Republican right, and it was a learning experiment for the Republican party as a whole. Hice has announced he will run in the Republican primary against Raffensperger for Georgia secretary of state. He is only one of the Republicans focused on taking over the states’ electoral apparatus to ensure that the next time there will be no obstacles. By December, Republicans had proposed 262 bills “to politicize, criminalize, or interfere with the non-partisan administration of elections”, with 32 becoming law in 17 states, according to the non-profit Protect Democracy group. The threat of intimidation, coercion and intimidation hangs over American politics. The coup may have failed, but it rolls on. • This article was amended on 16 and 30 January 2022.

Cage was speaking as part of a wide-ranging roundtable discussion for the Hollywood Reporter with fellow actors including Peter Dinklage, Jonathan Majors and Andrew Garfield. On being asked whether guns should be banned from film sets in the wake of the Rust shooting, Cage responded by saying that “movie stars” needed to know how to perform certain activities that may be outside the experience of workaday actors. “You need to know how to fight. You’re going to do fight scenes. You need to know how to ride a motorcycle. You need to know how to use a stick shift and drive sports cars, and you do need to know how to use a gun. You do. You need to take the time to know what the procedure is. Those are part of the job profiles.” Cage also added that these can overlap with the role of a stunt performer, in a mutually beneficial way. “The stunt man and the movie star are two jobs that coexist. Every stunt man needs to be a movie star, and every movie star needs to be a stunt man.” Hutchins died, and director Joel Souza was wounded, on the Rust set in October 2021, after a live round was discharged from a gun carried by actor Alec Baldwin, as Baldwin was rehearsing for a scene.

I took this photograph looking ahead at the Bealach na h-Uidhe pass as we walked from Inchnadamph en route to Glencoul bothy and back again. We had hiked this path as part of the Cape Wrath trail several years ago, in glorious sunshine, and we never thought it possible to get the same incredible conditions again. Yet we did! In the midst of this ongoing pandemic we were reacquainted with space, peace and the most incredible views – exactly what we needed, two humans and our two gorgeous rescue dogs out in the wilds of beautiful Scotland. It was magical. Sarah Lapping it up in Llandudno
Llandudno has it all for a visit: seaside attractions, brilliant walks (uphill) and cycle paths (flat) along the seafront. Every year we visit Llandudno to celebrate my birthday by marching over the Great Orme headland. Orme is my mother’s family name and 5 June is also Saint Tudno’s day at the lovely church on the Orme (Saint Tudno is the patron saint of Llandudno). Good to follow with Fish Tram Chips for a delightful chippy dinner. We often stay at the Empire Hotel (doubles from £65 room only) which makes a brilliant contribution to the celebration, with lovely rooms and perfect breakfasts. Dining at Dylan’s, in the magnificent Grade-II listed former Washington Hotel building on the promenade is a lovely way to finish the day. Alison A trek and a trot in Mongolia
In 2015 I took a two-week solo trip to Mongolia. While there I went on seven-day horse group trek with Stepperiders. It was under £500 for the week. Having just been through a difficult breakup it was enormously cathartic galloping over the steppe with new friends, camping by night, and enjoying homecooked food every day. I truly felt as if I was away from it all. Staying in Ulaanbaatar itself was safe, affordable and friendly. I met so many female solo travellers on my trip too, some of whom I’m still in touch with. I am not someone who normally travels alone, but I came back feeling very much empowered by it. Nadia Zuberi-Clow Peak Patagonia
This is Mount Fitz Roy, in the southern Andes. We started our trip at El Chalten, a frontier town full of walkers and climbers; beyond that there is only the mountains then the Southern Patagonian Icefield, stretching to the Pacific via Bernardo O’Higgins and Torres del Paine national parks. The eternal winds blowing off the ice field mean bad weather is frequent, and we had prepared for the possibility that in our three-day stay we might not be able to see and do anything much. But we got lucky. Pictured is our first view of the mountains, on the long drive across the Argentinian steppe. It perhaps captures a bit of our awe and excitement, but not the fierce wind that made simply getting out of the car challenging. And the next two days’ walking were magnificent.

And we thought it never rained in Atacama. Marian isn’t posing in this picture, in the Tebenquiche nature reserve near San Pedro de Atacama. She had just bought the white hat – for about £5 – to protect her from the endless searing desert sun. Made of paper, it was not suited to the mother of all thunderstorms approaching. Marian had been trying to photograph lightning, unsuccessfully as it happened. The generally apocalyptic air suited the times – it was March 2020, Covid was sweeping the globe, and the locals were despondent about the total collapse of the tourist trade. All the more reason to return one day, spend freely, and see the heat haze shimmering over the sun-baked salt flats of Atacama. John Main

The Callanish standing stones are a world-famous series of megaliths on the west coast of the Isle of Lewis. We arrived before dawn to plan our position and to set up our tripods and cameras. I ensured there were visible gaps in the stones before waiting patiently for a sunburst that I could only dream about capturing. I waited and I was rewarded. Diane Le Count Desert varnish, Namibia
This photo brings back memories of an amazing trip, exploring and camping in the deserts of Namibia. To some, this photo is empty, but not to us. This at least 55-million-year-old desert is the oldest in the world, and the landscape narrates its past. The shine on boulders is desert varnish: they’re polished by centuries of sand-laden wind. Distant mountains are inscribed with stories from pre-historic bushmen. A barely perceptible area of green reveals where the Huab river occasionally flows, and in which we watched a herd of elephants. The photo depicts our love affair with the abundance of deserts.

We followed her and her two mahouts, Lavkush and Diva, on their daily 20-minute walk to the river, amazed at how quickly she walked for someone of her size. Nearing the water, she raced ahead and eventually we heard a huge splash and saw ripples. After luxuriating in the water, Tara was led to a shallow section where we had fun scrubbing her with stones before being rewarded with a trunk shower.

33;33;5273;5273;Time on Rock by Anna Fleming review – vertiginous adventures;2022-01-06T11:00:01Z;['PD Smith'];['Autobiography and memoir', 'Books', 'Rock climbing', 'Culture', 'Sport and leisure books'];"Climbing, says Anna Fleming, is “a form of dance”, an intensely physical ballet between self and rock. This book charts her stony path to mastering the craft of traditional climbing, from being a “terrified novice” to a “competent leader”. Unlike sport climbing, where bolts are left in the rock for others to use, traditional climbing involves a lead climber who inserts metalware into cracks in the rock, to which safety ropes are attached. These are then collected by the climber’s partner.
Leading, Fleming admits, used to terrify her. But what she describes as the “electrifying charge” of risk is an essential part of learning to climb. Falling and being caught by the rope is a necessary experience. Climbing the Cuillin on Skye in her early 20s, she was saved by her rope from “the brink of a mortal abyss” when a large block she caught hold of came loose. “I walked away feeling deeply humbled, carrying an enhanced respect for the gravity of these heightened places,” she writes. Only when she returned four years later to complete the route did she feel that her “mountain apprenticeship” had been truly served. As an undergraduate she began climbing indoors: “On the wall I became a network of muscles, limbs, senses, nerves, cells and neurons; an active, thinking, sensing being.” Climbing gave her “a new map of my body”. In the early 2000s, a woman could find herself alone among men on an indoor climbing wall. Now they are full of women and girls, and the climbing community feels different: “It seems like a quiet revolution has happened in the last 10 years.” Rock climbing was a different challenge, with its changeable conditions and the need for absolute attention. It demanded an intense focus on the world at her fingertips – cracks, surface texture, flakes of rock – to find a route to the top. In this heightened state of awareness, “thousands of years vanish and I hear the acute sensitivity of my ancestors”. But at the summit a new perspective opens up, revealing distant landscapes and wildlife. These two viewpoints – the micro and the macro – offer a transformative sense of one’s place in the scheme of things. For Fleming, climbing is not about “reducing huge landscapes and environments to peaks that must be conquered”. It’s a more personal and profound experience, offering “a direct route into the spellbinding potency of place”. Nan Shepherd described “walking out of my body and into the mountain”. Fleming, too, finds that while climbing, the self disappears, “lost to movement and environment”. She describes how the “physical contact and bodily perception” of climbing offers her both a “journey into the rock” and a profound connectedness to the landscape, an existential rootedness in nature that echoes the current writing of Elizabeth-Jane Burnett and Robin Wall Kimmerer. Fleming has written a wonderfully intimate account of climbing, filled with the rough texture of rocks and the hard-won elation of reaching for the skies. This is a book about geology and place, selfhood and nature – a rich celebration of “stony matter” and our relationship to it across the ages. • Time on Rock: A Climber’s Route into the Mountains is published by Canongate (£16.99).

34;34;5274;5274;‘Ghost’ orchid that grows in the dark among new plant finds;2022-01-06T11:00:00Z;['Damian Carrington'];['Plants', 'Conservation', 'Biodiversity', 'Environment', 'Kew Gardens', 'Science', 'Wildlife', 'Wild flowers'];"A ghost orchid that grows in complete darkness, an insect-trapping tobacco plant and an “exploding firework” flower are among the new species named by scientists in the last year. The species range from a voodoo lily from Cameroon to a rare tooth fungus unearthed near London, UK. A new tree from the ylang-ylang family is the first to be named in 2022 and is being named after the actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio. He campaigned to revoke a logging concession which threatened the African tree, which features glossy yellow flowers on its trunk. The highlighted plants are among the 205 new species named in 2021 by scientists from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and their collaborators around the world. All are vital parts of the planet’s biodiversity and some may provide food and medicine. However, several are already extinct in the wild and many threatened by the destruction of forests, expanding palm oil plantations and mining. There are 400,000 named plant species and two in five are threatened with extinction. The scientists said it was a race against time to identify new plants before they disappeared for ever. In total, scientists across the world have named about 2,000 new plant species each year for at least a decade. “It’s almost bewildering that we’re still discovering so many,” said Dr Martin Cheek, at RBG Kew. “But now is our last chance to find unknown species, name them and hopefully protect them before they become globally extinct.” The new ghost orchid is one of 16 new orchids from dense and remote forests in Madagascar. It was named Didymoplexis stella-silvae by Kew’s Johan Hermans, meaning “star of the forest” as it grows in complete darkness and has star-like flowers. It has no leaves or chlorophyll for photosynthesis and gets all its nutrients in symbiosis with underground fungi. The flower only pokes through the forest-floor humus for a day to attract pollinators, which may be ants.
Three of the new orchids are already thought to be extinct in the wild due to destruction of their forest homes, including one tree-dwelling species that was probably eradicated due to the demand for geranium oil used in aromatherapy. “Sadly, Madagascar’s many unique plants are under threat from deforestation and droughts, floods, and fires caused by climate change,” said Hermans. “It really is a race against time.” The unusual tobacco plant was among seven new species found near a truck stop in Western Australia and is covered in sticky glands that trap and kill insects, most likely as a defensive measure. “The arid parts of Australia, which include most of the continent, have been thought of as almost barren, but in recent years these poorly studied areas have yielded many new and unusual species,” said Prof Mark Chase, at RBG Kew. The tropics are known hotspots for biodiversity and a spectacular new species of primrose found in Borneo was named Ardisia pyrotechnica because its shower of white flowers resembles exploding fireworks. However, it is already assessed as critically endangered, as only a few plants have been found in two locations and it is under threat from palm oil plantations. “Who knows how many thousands of plant species it will be revealed in future to have likely become extinct due to palm oil plantations,” said Cheek. “It’s sickening.”
The new pink voodoo lily has a 30cm-tall flower spike and was found in a small corner of the vast Ebo Forest of Cameroon. The tree named after Di Caprio was also found in the Ebo Forest. But despite the cancelling of logging permits in August 2020 by the president of Cameroon, Uvariopsis dicaprio remains critically endangered because its habitat remains unprotected from potential future logging.
The new fungus was first found in the UK’s Windsor Great Park under a sweet chestnut tree in 2008, but not named until now as DNA analysis of a suite of species had to be completed together. It is one of a group of unusual fungi that form mushrooms with elongated teeth under their caps, rather than gills, and are becoming rarer due to nitrogen pollution from agriculture. Another new species, a blue-berried bush from the coffee family found in Borneo, took even longer to be scientifically named. It was first seen by scientists in a painting by the eminent botanical artist Marianne North, made in 1876 during a stay by the Sarawak river. One new species was discovered not in the wild, but in the laboratory. The microscopic fungus was found lurking in a wild banana seed from Vietnam kept at Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank in Sussex. Fusarium chuoi, which has a coral colour and a velvety texture, is an “endophyte”, a fungus that lives inside a plant without causing it any visible harm. Distinguishing these from pathogenic fungi is crucial for protecting plant health, the scientists said.

35;35;5275;5275;‘Urban fire storm’: suburban sprawl raising risk of destructive wildfires;2022-01-06T11:00:00Z;['Gabrielle Canon'];['Wildfires', 'Colorado', 'US news'];"It was just after sunrise on New Year’s Eve when climate scientist Daniel Swain paused outside his home in Boulder county, Colorado. Snow was beginning to fall and a strong acrid smell – “like burned plastic”, Swain said – hung on the newly chilled breeze. A fast-moving wildfire had torn through the area the day before, leaving devastation in its wake. Driven by winds of more than 100mph, what started as a small brush fire swiftly consumed nearly 1,000 homes within 24 hours.
While relatively small in size – just 6,000 acres – the wildfire was the most destructive in Colorado’s history, a feat that speaks to the growing danger of what Swain calls the “urban fire storm”. Areas where suburban sprawl meets landscapes primed by drought and other climate conditions to burn – known as the wildland urban interface (WUI) – are growing, posing new threats in places once considered safe from wildfire. The Colorado fire engulfed neighborhoods and commercial districts alike, forcing 35,000 people to flee their homes. It torched a Target, a Tesla dealership, and a Costco, not long after unsuspecting Sunday shoppers were evacuated. Two people are still missing. “The wildland urban interface extends over a far broader area than many folks realize – and it is also dynamic,” Swain said. “Most of the time it is true that these areas are safe from wildfire but given conditionally extreme wind conditions and extreme drought, they became part of that interface.” That the fire also happened in December, a time once considered well outside of fire season, has also raised alarm. “It was strange to have the snow start falling,” Swain said, “and to have that smell of the remnants of almost 1,000 homes wafting through the air.” The area had had one of its warmest winters. This year, the 30in of snowfall Boulder typically gets by December failed to appear. The region saw just 1.6in of precipitation since the beginning of August. “That’s natural variability,” atmospheric scientist Matthew Cappucci noted on Twitter, “but in warmer world, it’s easy to evaporate more of what little water falls.” When the fire ignited, drought levels in the area were classified as “extreme” by the US Drought Monitor. It’s long been clear that what’s considered “fire season” is stretching longer, covering more months of the year. And, while that increases the number of days when a fire could start it also brings conditions in line with winter weather patterns – like dry wind – that vastly increase the danger. Strong gusts aren’t unusual in Colorado, especially in the Boulder area, but without snow and rain to dampen the risks, disaster was able to strike. “A lot of these events – from fires to mudslides – are just a consequence of extreme events many months in the making,” said Andrew Hoell, a meteorologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s physical sciences laboratory, noting the compounding effect drought and heat has had on fires. Record-low precipitation was intensified by record-high temperatures. It’s a recipe for disaster, and one that Hoell is familiar with. “I am used to talking about extreme events,” he said. But, based in Boulder, this one hit close to home. His house was spared, but many in his community, both colleagues and friends, lost their homes. “It always gets you down. But when it’s your friends, your neighborhood, your community – it is a whole different ball game.” Thousands without homes are searching through the rubble and trying to put back the pieces. Recovery is expected to take years. The cause of this blaze is still under investigation. The Boulder county sheriff, Joe Pelle, told reporters that downed power lines, which were initially suspected as the ignition source, have been ruled out.
Most fires are still started by people, intentionally or not, and with more people living in high-risk areas, the dangers only continue to mount. “What the science said is that growth is occurring faster in the wildland urban interface than anywhere else” said Carrie Berger, fire program manager of the forestry & natural resources extension fire program at Oregon State University. “That’s where people are moving most rapidly.” A third of US homes currently stand in the WUI and that number is only going to grow as the construction march into the wildland continues, and as higher temperatures increase the boundaries of burnable land. That’s why scientists and disaster experts are pushing for a shift in focus from suppression to preparation. “We live in a fire landscape,” Berger said. “I don’t think there’s any place that is safe from wildfire.” She emphasized the need for a community approach to fire safety, complete with home hardening techniques like reducing vegetation that brushes up to buildings, crafting and coordinating plans, and using fire-resistant building materials. Climate scientist Daniel Swain echoed her calls. While this disaster hit close to home, he emphasized that the next one could occur anywhere. “This is not a unique problem to Boulder county. This is not a unique problem to Colorado. This is not even a unique problem to the American west – and I think this comes at a surprise to most people,” he said. As temperatures rise and aridification spreads into other landscapes, big blazes could erupt out of the forested areas in the upper midwest. They could spread through Florida, burn in Georgia, or blacken suburban New Jersey the way they do now in California and Colorado. “All of a sudden you have conditions that really aren’t all that different from what they would be like in the west,” Swain says. “That might make things possible that were simply impossible before.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/urban-fire-storm-suburban-sprawl-wildfires-colorado;1
36;36;5276;5276;Britain’s shameful slavery history matters – that’s why a jury acquitted the Colston Four | David Olusoga ;2022-01-06T10:58:48Z;['David Olusoga'];['Black Lives Matter movement', 'Protest', 'Bristol', 'UK news', 'Slavery', 'Law'];"There were cheers from the public gallery of Bristol crown court when the verdicts of not guilty were returned. Eighteen months after Bristol’s now infamous statue of the slave trader Edward Colston was sent crashing to the pavement, the four young people who had been charged with criminal damage were acquitted. The strategy that the prosecution appears to have adopted – in a case that some now argue should never have been brought to trial – seemed to centre on asking that the jury be blind to history. Who the statue venerated, they argued, was irrelevant. This, they claimed, was an open-and-shut case of criminal damage, one in which the defendants did not even deny their role in the toppling of the statue or, in one case, helping to roll it to Bristol harbourside, from where it was cast into the water. The contention of the prosecution was that the crimes of Edward Colston, shareholder and ultimately deputy governor of the Royal African Company, the most prolific slave-trading entity in British history, should simply be set aside. That the statue depicted a man whose wealth was based on the enslavement of 84,000 men, women and children was immaterial. As was the fact that he was complicit in the deaths of 19,000 of them, who died, squirming in agony, chained to the decks of the Royal African Company’s slave ships. That should be of no concern to the jury. Their suffering, their deaths, their very existence was irrelevant to the issue at hand. In adopting such a strategy the prosecution was merely asking the jury to occupy the same stance of wilful, moral blindness that Colston’s defenders have occupied for decades.
That strategy failed because the lawyers defending the so-called Colston Four were able, through their own legal arguments and the striking eloquence of the four young defendants, to place history at the centre of this trial. In this I played a small part, appearing as an expert witness for the defence. They successfully demonstrated that the real offenders were not the Colston Four, but the city of Bristol and those who have done everything in their power to burnish the reputation of a mass murderer. The keepers of Colston’s legacy had rendered his historic crimes live and present through the erection of a statue to him. By allowing that edifice to stand for 125 years, even as Bristol became home to thousands of black people whose ancestors had been victims of the trade that the Royal African Company had pioneered, they had, so argued the defence, permitted the statue to become an “indecent display”. Having established these arguments Liam Walker QC, representing Sage Willoughby, the youngest of the defendants, argued that the Colston Four “were on the right side of history”. Jurors were invited to join them there. In the aftermath of this verdict those who now have questions to answer are Colston’s defenders. In particular the Society of Merchant Venturers, a grouping that for decades dismissed and discounted appeals for the statue to be removed or contextualised. Its strategy of muddying waters and maintaining the status quo fostered indecision and inaction. Decades of inertia were brought to an end in just under three hours – the time it took for the jury to arrive at its verdict. The merchant elite of late Victorian Bristol who erected the statue of Colston, many of them members of the Merchant Venturers, did so in the full knowledge that the man they sought to elevate to civic sainthood had been a trader in human flesh. The details of his grim career had been obscured but not obliterated. Despite what they knew they expanded the bizarre cult of rituals, religious services and exclusive dinners that had been built around him, but their most public triumph was the erection of the statue. To validate the imposition of the cult of Colston on to the wider city they falsely implied that the statue had been paid for through popular, public subscription. They did all of this confident in the belief that no one would ever question their decisions, as no one would ever come to care about Colston’s crimes or his victims. Their confidence sprang from their collective inability to envisage a future moment in which the Africans who had perished in the bellies of the Royal African Company’s ships, or on the plantations of Barbados or Jamaica, would matter to anyone in Bristol or beyond. The moment they were unable to conceive of is now. The generation for whom the lives of Colston’s victims matter deeply is the generation from whom the four defendants in this case were drawn. In the months since the murder of George Floyd millions of people across the world have examined their nations’ official histories, and the history lessons they were taught at school. They have discovered missing chapters, half-truths and lost connections between the crimes of then and the inequalities of now. As Rhian Graham, one of the Colston Four, noted in the impromptu speech she made from the pavement outside court, the dethronement of Colston was not a stand-alone event, but part of a global movement. I am writing this from Covid isolation in a hotel on the southern coast of Barbados. From my window I can see the approaches to the island, the sea lanes along which the ships of the Atlantic slave trade once passed, before docking to unload their human cargoes. To the north of me is a place called Speightstown, its nickname in the 18th century was “Little Bristol”, so firmly was it connected to the slave traders and sugar merchants of that English city 4,000 miles away. The global shift of consciousness that inspired the toppling of Colston was also a factor in the decision made by the people of this island to break decisively away from that history and become a republic. This shift in consciousness, translated into action across the world by the young, will be strengthened by this verdict; and by the very fact that when made aware of long obscured historical and moral truths, an English jury chose to placeitself – and the city of Bristol – on the right side of history.

37;37;5277;5277;French MPs pass controversial Covid vaccine bill with large majority;2022-01-06T10:56:06Z;['Kim Willsher'];['France', 'Coronavirus', 'Europe', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Society'];"French MPs have passed the government’s controversial vaccine pass bill after three days of an angry stop-start debate. The legislation, which requires people to be fully vaccinated to enjoy social, sporting and cultural activities, was approved by a large majority in the assemblée nationale in the early hours of Thursday morning. The bill was passed by 214 votes against 93 and 27 abstentions. It will now be presented to the upper house, the sénat, to be debated on Monday. Ministers had hoped to introduce the controversial measure on 15 January, but the often heated parliamentary debate was suspended twice this week. The law was first held up when MPs voted to go home just before midnight on Monday, then again on Wednesday after a row erupted over language used by the president, Emmanuel Macron’s when he promised to make life difficult for unvaccinated people. While more than 90% of French adults have been fully jabbed, one of the highest rates in the world, the remaining 10% – estimated at around 5 million people, including Brigitte Bardot, the actor turned animal activist, have refused to have the Covid vaccine. Until now they have been able to use a passe sanitaire (health pass) that required either vaccination, recovery from Covid or a negative Covid test for everyone over the age of 12 to access restaurants, bars, museums, theatres and other public places. In October, the government put an end to free Covid tests for unvaccinated people, but the new legislation goes a step further in requiring people to be fully vaccinated to access such places.
Macron said the measure was intended to coerce vaccine-hesitant people to get inoculated by further restricting their everyday activities. The law also introduces hefty fines and prison sentences for anyone caught using or supplying fake vaccine passes and for establishments that fail properly to check visitors’ vaccine status. The pass will not be required for shops or medical facilities such as hospitals and clinics. Vaccination is currently compulsory only for health workers, but the new law would extend this to those who work in venues where they are in contact with the public. Macron, who is expected to be re-elected in April, has ruled out making the vaccine obligatory for everyone. About 66,000 people had their first vaccine on Wednesday after the president’s controversial comments, the highest number in 24 hours since the beginning of October.
The prime minister, Jean Castex, told the French news and weather channel BFMTV he hoped the vaccine pass could come into force on 15 January as originally planned and described the Covid situation in France as “extremely worrying”. Castex defended Macron’s controversial use of the verb “emmerder” (widely translated as “piss off”) in his vow to put pressure on those French people who refused to be vaccinated, saying the former president, Georges Pompidou, had used the same word. Macron also angered critics by calling unvaccinated people irresponsible, adding: “Someone irresponsible is not a citizen.” “Let’s not play with words, of course the non vaccinated are still [French] citizens,” Castex said. “What the president wanted to say is that when you are a citizen of our beautiful republic, you have rights, but also duties. It’s called civic-mindedness, it’s called a sense of responsibility.” On Thursday, it was revealed Bardot was among those facing Macron’s ire: the 87-year-old actor said she had not been vaccinated as she was “allergic to all chemical substances”.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/french-mps-pass-controversial-covid-vaccine-bill-with-large-majority;1
38;38;5278;5278;UK drivers overcharged by £5m a day for petrol, claims RAC;2022-01-06T10:47:22Z;['Mark Sweney'];['Petrol prices', 'Motoring', 'UK news', 'Business', 'Money'];Motorists paid £5m more a day for fuel than they should have last month after petrol station owners refused to pass on a drop in wholesale prices to consumers, the RAC has claimed. The motoring organisation called December a “rotten month” despite the price of unleaded petrol falling by 2p per litre, after estimating that petrol retailers should have reduced the cost by 12p. The RAC said that instead of pocketing the traditional long-term margin of 6p a litre, retailers took an average of 16p a litre on petrol and 12.5p on diesel. Across December, the RAC estimates that drivers collectively lost out on £156m, or £5m a day, from the wholesale price cuts not being passed on by retailers. “December was a rotten month for drivers as they were taken advantage of by retailers,” said Simon Williams, fuel spokesperson at the RAC. “In the past when wholesale prices have dropped retailers have always done the right thing – eventually – and reduced their pump prices. “This time they’ve stood strong, taking advantage of all the media talk about ‘higher energy prices’ and banked on the oil price rising again and catching up with their artificially inflated prices, which it now has done.” The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), the body which represents independent filling stations in the UK, said that the retail fuel market was“extremely competitive” and that drivers were likely to have benefited more than the RAC’s figures indicated. “December’s pump price data is less reliable because it is taken from fuel card transactions, and there have been far fewer of these transactions because of the reduction in business activity between Christmas and New Year,” said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA. “The costs of running petrol stations rose all year, with electricity up 19%, vastly reduced margins from fuel cards as well as increased national insurance and wage inflation.” In September, the PRA chair, Brian Madderson, said he did not “condone profiteering” as petrol prices rocketed and filling stations ran dry due to panic buying. The RAC said in December it cost drivers £6 more to fill up a typical family car than if petrol retailers had stuck to taking the traditional 6p margin and passed savings on to motorists. Diesel vehicle owners paid £4 more than they potentially could have. The RAC said at the end of last year Asda had the cheapest petrol, followed by Sainsbury’s, while motorists in Northern Ireland have the cheapest petrol on average in the UK.;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/06/uk-drivers-overcharged-by-5m-a-day-for-petrol-claims-rac;4
39;39;5279;5279;Khawaja’s stand-in century a triumph for Australia’s old problem solver | Geoff Lemon;2022-01-06T10:34:58Z;['Geoff Lemon'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'Australia cricket team', 'England cricket team', 'The Ashes', 'Australia sport', 'Cricket', 'Sport'];"There was a moment early in the second day at the Sydney Cricket Ground when Steve Smith looked nailed on for a hundred. Sure, it was a dot ball, and sure, he was on seven at the time. But there was something about the way he stepped into a straight drive back at Stuart Broad, the feet moving perfectly, the timing crisp with no attempt at power, the line so straight that the bowler bent to scoop up the ball. At the ground where Smith made three international centuries in the previous Australian summer, he looked like Smith looks when he is most switched on. Yet a few hours later, it was Usman Khawaja raising his bat to the cheers of a home crowd. Broad had got the better of Smith for 67, to an uncharacteristic push at a ball that didn’t require one. Khawaja had left the bowling impeccably, defended it resolutely, and taken it on when given the opportunity, in an innings that showed all of the best parts of his game built over the course of his lengthening career.
It was the shortcomings in his game that led to Khawaja spending most of the past two and a half years outside the national team, having been dropped after the third Ashes Test at Headingley in 2019. Khawaja had not had a terrible series batting at first drop, making 40 in an important partnership at Edgbaston and 36 in another at Lord’s. But he hadn’t made a compelling score, and then ran into some bad luck or bad timing. Australia pulled the trigger on the opener Cameron Bancroft early, replacing him with Marcus Harris after two Tests. Marnus Labuschagne impressed in the third Test as Smith’s concussion replacement, and had to be retained when Smith returned. Had Australia given Bancroft one more match, he could either have succeeded and kept his spot, or been replaced by Khawaja moving up the order. But with Harris having played only once, selectors had to keep him for a stint that was ultimately worse than Bancroft’s, while Khawaja returned home to a poor Sheffield Shield season and floated out of the reckoning entirely. Since then the reasonable conclusion has been that Khawaja’s time is done. He turned 35 just before Christmas, while Labuschagne has cemented himself in Khawaja’s old spot at No 3, and Will Pucovski emerged as the young tyro most likely to accompany David Warner’s final years at the top. Warner and Smith are also moving deeper into their 30s and overall the Test team has needed to be refreshed.
But just as things change quickly in one direction, they can go quickly in the other. Khawaja had a good half-season, Pucovski was ruled out with another concussion injury, Travis Head returned a positive Covid test, and suddenly there was a spot that needed to be filled, and a job that needed to be done. Khawaja is no stranger to solving problems for Australia. During the one-day World Cup in 2019 he was thrown in at No 5 despite never having batted there in List A cricket. In the current match he was asked to bat there despite never having done so in Tests. By this point of his career the details such as where he bats don’t seem to faze Khawaja. He walked in on the first evening with Australia 117 for three, with trouble looming for the team if he failed, and instead made sure that he didn’t. He first batted through to stumps, then through the first session of the next day with Smith, before assuming the senior role once Smith was gone. Through those hours, and his 260 deliveries, his patience and concentration shone through. At times in his career Khawaja’s innings have been ended by lapses in either. After a long first session with an extra half-hour, as he moved beyond his half-century, he opened up his repertoire of strokes: that lavish cover drive, a back cut, the pull. But they were careful selections for the right occasion, not extravagances for their own sake. Through he went past tea, towards sunset, taking Australia to a point where his eventual dismissal for 137 prompted a charge towards a declaration rather than a rearguard.
Of course, there is the question of what is next. But Khawaja before this match said that he was filling in for the match in Head’s spot. He is probably right, with the longer-term holder having been anointed and having made his own match-defining century in Brisbane. Head will return for the fifth Test in Hobart. Khawaja’s assignment was short-term and it has been fulfilled immaculately. It doesn’t need to lead to anything else for it to be a triumph in its own right, a player showing that he still has what it takes years after he stopped getting that chance. Beyond Hobart, Australia will play nine Tests in Asia in the coming year. On his last visit in 2018 Khawaja made his masterpiece 140 to save a Test in Dubai. There is every likelihood that more chances will arise, and Khawaja has shown himself ready.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/06/khawaja-stand-in-century-a-triumph-for-australias-old-problem-solver-ashes-cricket;4
40;40;5280;5280;Dogs may be able to tell difference between speech patterns, study finds;2022-01-06T10:30:02Z;['Nicola Davis'];['Dogs', 'Animals', 'World news', 'Science', 'Pets', 'Life and style', 'Language', 'Neuroscience'];Dogs may appear to have selective hearing when it comes to commands but research suggests they are paying attention to human chit-chat. Researchers – who arranged for headphone-wearing dogs to listen to excerpts from the novella The Little Prince – revealed the brains of our canine companions can tell the difference between speech and non-speech when listening to human voices, and show different responses to speech in an unfamiliar language. The team said the findings supported other studies that suggest animals may share some human skills. “Our capacities to process speech and languages are not necessarily unique in all the ways we like to think they are,” said Dr Attila Andics, senior author of the study at Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary. The research involved 18 dogs of various ages and breeds that were trained to lie in an MRI scanner without restraint or sedation, but with headphones on. They were then played recordings either of humans reading excerpts from The Little Prince by Antoine De Saint-Exupéry or those same recordings cut up into small pieces and put back together in a different order so it sounded unnatural. The results, published in the journal NeuroImage, reveal the dogs’ brains showed a different activity pattern in the primary auditory cortex for speech compared with non-speech, with the findings similar regardless of whether the language used – Hungarian or Spanish – was familiar. Curiously, the longer the dog’s head was, the better their brain could distinguish speech from non-speech. The team also found the activity pattern was stronger for non-speech. “In humans, you typically see stronger response to speech,” Andics told the Guardian, adding it appears a different mechanism is at play in dogs and they are not “tuned in” to speech. “Probably what they detect is that the normal, natural speech sounds natural. And the other one sounds surprising, strange, not the typical pattern we hear,” he said. The research also revealed familiar and unfamiliar languages gave rise to different responses in the secondary auditory cortex and precruciate gyrus – but only for speech. That was important, said Andics, as it suggested the ability to distinguish between languages was not simply down to the speakers being different. Instead, the team said, the differences seen between languages for speech are probably down to exposure to the familiar language and a sensitivity to language-specific regularities. “This is also supported by the observation that older dogs show the stronger differentiation between the two languages,” said Andics. He said it made sense to explore response to human speech in dogs, since they shared our environment. But questions remained. “Whether this is something that only dog brains can do or not, or whether dogs indeed became better at detecting speech as a result of certain brain changes during these tens of thousands of years of domestication, we are not sure,” he said. Sophie Scott, professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London, said she welcomed the research. “[It is a] very nice demonstration of just how much dogs are listening to our voices and how much information they’re pulling out, even if that is not necessarily speech that is directed to them or containing words they might recognise,” she said. “Almost everything that you can find about human speech and human language and you say, ‘ah this is unique to humans’, you find an animal somewhere that can do it.”;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/06/dogs-may-be-able-to-tell-difference-between-speech-patterns-study-finds;6
41;41;5281;5281;From Bennacer to Haller: Africa Cup of Nations players to watch ;2022-01-06T10:24:29Z;['Paul Doyle'];['Africa Cup of Nations', 'Morocco football team', 'Algeria football team', 'Ivory Coast football team', 'Tunisia football team', 'Nigeria football team', 'Africa Cup of Nations 2022', 'Football', 'Sport'];"1. Romain Saïss Morocco Maybe Saïss can no longer be described as underrated after his manager at Wolves, Bruno Lage, proclaimed him to be “the Moroccan Maldini” but the 31-year-old still tends not to get a mention in discussions of the Premier League’s most reliable and inspirational defenders despite his continued excellence this season. His quality has long been recognised in Morocco, whom he has captained since 2020 and hopes to lead on a better campaign than their disappointing past two appearances in the Cup of Nations. They will certainly not be allowed to ease their way into the 2022 edition, since they face Ghana in the first group game. While Saïss drives his team on from the rear, assisted by the wonderful Paris Saint-Germain full-back Achraf Hakimi, Morocco are likely to look to Ryan Mmaee to make the difference for them up front. The 24-year-forward, who plays for Ferencvaros, has made a thrilling impact since declaring for Morocco last year, his speed and dribbling helping him to score four goals – and create another four – in four matches. Born in Belgium to a Moroccan mother, he – and his brother Samy, who could partner Saïss in central defence – will be aiming for glory in Cameroon, the birthplace of their father. That would be a lovely family story and also help vindicate the decision of the manager, Vahid Halilhodzic, to leave out Chelsea’s Hakim Ziyech for a perceived lack of commitment.
2. Ismaël Bennacer Algeria Djamel Belmadi was a hothead as a player but his serene leadership since becoming his country’s manager in 2018 is the chief reason why Algeria are the favourites to win the tournament and retain the crown they claimed in 2019. The manager has brought order where there had been disarray, finding a way to turn an array of gifted individuals into a powerful collective. There is much more to Algeria than Riyad Mahrez. Milan’s Bennacer, voted player of the last tournament, is not as spectacular as the Manchester City magician but is a dynamic, clever and constant influence in midfield, where Saïd Benrahma can also be expected to create regular problems for opponents – and chances for Youcef Belaïli, a striker who is seeking a new club after being let go last month by his Qatari employers a day after, coincidentally, scoring for Algeria to knock Qatar out of the Arab Cup. 3. Sébastien Haller Ivory Coast This striker is not defined by the past. He was a youth international for France and a flop for West Ham. Now, with Ajax, he is top scorer in the Dutch league and he set a record this season by scoring 10 goals in the Champions League group stage. He hopes to take that form into the Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, whose attack he has been leading since scoring on his debut in November 2020. In addition to one of European football’s most in-form strikers, the Elephants boast, with Franck Kessié and Ibrahim Sangaré, one of the strongest central midfields at the tournament. They could seriously complicate things for Algeria, whom they meet in the group stage and maybe later, too.
4. Hannibal Mejbri Tunisia The midfielder, who turns 19 this month, has made one senior appearance for Manchester United, a fact Ralf Rangnick has suggested he hopes to change after Mejbri returns from his latest international adventure. He impressed at last month’s Arab Cup, where he helped Tunisia to finish as runners-up. There he demonstrated not just his technical finesse but also his personality, as he fended off occasional attempts to rough him up and took plenty of creative initiative. Reaching the final in Cameroon will be much harder but with Mejbri helping Wahbi Khazri to add ingenuity to a well-drilled side, Tunisia could go far.
5. Steven Caulker Sierra Leone Caulker’s only appearance for England, in 2012, is not easy to forget: the defender scored by heading in a free-kick from Steven Gerrard, who was making his 100th appearance, but that was rather overshadowed by four goals from one of the forwards he was tasked with subduing, Zlatan Ibrahimovic (although Caulker was on the pitch for only one of them). That was all in a friendly, however, and since Caulker did not appear again for England, he is free to celebrate his roots by representing Sierra Leone, where his paternal grandfather was born. When he makes his competitive debut at the Cup of Nations, it will be a moment to savour for the 30-year-old, who has overcome mental illness to continue to enjoy his career. The former Liverpool and Tottenham defender plays for Gaziantep in Turkey, on loan from Fenerbahçe. Sierra Leone are underdogs in a difficult group but making it to the tournament is a commendable achievement for the country and for Caulker.
6. Chidera Ejuke Nigeria Nigeria’s spluttering performances over the past year led to the dismissal of Gernot Rohr, who had been the country’s longest-serving manager until being jettisoned last month. The preparations of the interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, have been hampered by the loss of key forwards: not just the brilliant Victor Osimhen but also Emmanuel Dennis and Odion Ighalo, whose Saudi club, Al Shabab, refused to let him go on similar grounds to those that enabled Watford to keep hold of Dennis. All of which is likely to increase the pressure on Kelechi Iheanacho to provide goals. He can expect high-class assistance from the wonderful winger Samuel Chukwueze but also from central areas if Eguavoen’s plan to deploy the CSKA Moscow wideman Ejuke as a No 10 pays off.

42;42;5282;5282;‘I hated it the minute it was finished’: bad body art and regrets in a tattoo removal clinic ;2022-01-06T10:00:03Z;['Sirin Kale'];['Tattoos', 'Fashion', 'Life and style', 'Beauty'];"At the temple of regret, you can have your mistakes burned away by a smiling practitioner, if you are willing to pay a hefty fee. I’m at an unremarkable office block near Monument tube station in central London, watching the remorseful have their body art erased at Pulse Light Clinic, which offers state-of-the-art tattoo removal using laser technology. As penitents of all ages, walks of life and ethnicities walk through the door, one thing becomes clear: there are a lot of terrible tattoos out there. In a spotless treatment room beside a £6,500 tattoo-removing PicoSure laser machine, senior practitioner Cherry Brierly is recounting her clients’ stories. “I had one lovely guy,” she says brightly. “He had a tattoo on his head. He was in his 60s, newly divorced. He came in and said: ‘It’s not me any more. I need to find a new wife.’” The tattoo said: “Made in London”. It disappeared in a single session. Probably the worst tattoos Brierly has removed were the terrible jokes: “‘Tupac’ written across the stomach,” she says. “Or ‘Brexit’ on the bum. Or camel drawn on a toe.” As a tattoo remover, Brierly has a direct line into the shifting vagaries of the human psyche. “One guy did practically his whole body,” she says. “Everything was tattooed. He’d gotten divorced and was a Muslim.” As some Muslims believe tattoos are forbidden, she thinks they were his way of declaring he didn’t want to be a Muslim any more. There was just one problem: he rediscovered his faith. “All that was within six months.” The most common tattoos Brierly removes, however, are tribal designs out of favour since their 90s heyday. “Tramp stamps” – a tattoo on a woman’s lower back – are also routinely sandblasted away, as are dolphins, another relic of the 90s. (Samantha Cameron has one on her foot.) More recently, Brierly has had clients coming in to have full sleeves removed, as the 2010s trend beloved of footballers and social media influencers burns itself out. And then, of course, there are names – heartbreak is always good business for the tattoo-removal trade. “We’re impulsive,” says Brierly when asked what she has learned from her career. “Very impulsive.” In an adjacent treatment room, Candice Smith is having a youthful indiscretion scrubbed clean. “I remember I was walking down the street,” says the 30-year-old social work student, from east London, “and someone said: ‘She’s got a strawberry on her leg!’ I think that did it for me.”
I contemplate the offending soft fruit, on Smith’s left calf. It is the size of a baby’s head, badly rendered in wobbly fluorescent pink. In all honesty, she’s making the right call. “It was only a small tattoo I wanted,” Smith sighs. “But it ended up being massive.” Smith can’t even remember why she got the strawberry tattoo – she is not particularly keen on the fruit but was 18 at the time, a wannabe Camden scene kid with tattoos, a face full of piercings, and an extreme haircut. “The regret kicked in as I got older,” Smith says. She’s having it lasered off so that she no longer has to worry about covering it when the weather gets warm. “Over the years,” she says, “it has just ruined every summer. I’m forever trying to cover it with the perfect length dress, and midi dresses aren’t my thing. Or culottes, which I don’t really like, but I wear because they cover the tattoo.” She is halfway through a course of six treatments, at a cost of £600, and her tattoo is much faded, although still visible. (Most tattoos take a number of sessions to be removed.) “I was shocked at how much it cost,” Smith says. “But I felt like getting this removed was very worth it for me.” Astonishingly, despite all this, she doesn’t regret the tattoo, and says it serves as a learning curve for her children. Beside her, practitioner Rene Cazzetta is programming the laser to the correct setting. Cazzetta is a smiling and ebullient presence with more than a decade’s experience in laser tattoo removal. Tattoos like Smith’s, she explains, pose a challenge, because pink is especially tricky to remove. “The way tattoo removal works,” Cazzetta says, “is that the laser breaks down the ink into very small particles, and the blood that flows under the skin takes away the ink.” The laser works on all skin types with black ink, but it can cause pigmentation – a permanent change to the colour of the skin – with coloured tattoos on black skin. Pink, yellow, and white are the most stubborn colours to remove; a practitioner may be able to fade them considerably, but a trace will remain. “They will go down in potency,” says Cazzatta, “and look like a bruise.” Some clients choose to cover up these faded remnants with a new tattoo; others are simply happy for their old ink to be barely visible. Visitors to the clinic are increasingly seeking to have their old tattoos removed and replaced by handiwork from artists more talented than the one who did the original tattoo. With darker inks, the laser can have phenomenal results: the tattoo simply vanishes, as if it was never there. Cazzetta, who is heavily tattooed, knows this first-hand: she had an ex-boyfriend’s name tattooed on her body, then had it lasered off after the breakup. “I wanted to join all my clients with their experiences,” she says drily. “I felt as if I was missing out.” As her ex-boyfriend’s name was written in fine black ink, it was soon gone. “He was removed in the space of 12 weeks,” Cazzetta smiles.
She relishes the challenge of a tattoo like Smith’s strawberry. “Every tattoo can be extremely different from another,” she says. “Some tattooists put cheaper ink in, which is harder to remove. I’ve been doing this for a decade. And still, sometimes, when a client walks in, I think: ‘OK, how will I do this?’” It is a skilled job that requires practitioners to understand how best to programme the laser for each pigment colour and skin type. The most difficult tattoo she has ever removed? A beauty spot, “because the ink was pushed so deep into the skin”. Smith has prepared for her session by rubbing anaesthetic numbing cream on to the tattoo – a must for anyone contemplating laser tattoo removal. Without it, says Brierly, “the pain is horrific. I’m not going to lie. It’s a feeling you can’t describe. Like burning hot oil.” The cream “takes the pain off,” Brierly says. “You can sit through it. It’s fine. You can still feel it, but it’s nothing like what it would be without it. Without it, it’s horrible.” The treatment itself takes less than two minutes: Cazzetta zaps the tattoo with a PicoWay laser, which flashes and looks a little like a soldering iron. (Practitioners switch between the two machines, the PicoSure and PicoWay, depending on the type of tattoo being removed.) “The only way I can explain it,” says Smith, “is that it feels like someone is stretching an elastic band and flicking you with it, without stopping.” At the end of the session, her strawberry is further faded: a berry stain, rather than a succulent fruit.
What becomes clear, after only a few hours in the clinic, is that there are a lot of tattoos out there that are not what the client had in mind. “I knew what I wanted,” says the hairdresser Roy Sword, furiously. “I drew it, and I knew exactly where I wanted it placed.” But his tattooist – Sword practically spits when he says his name – did not get it right. “I’m annoyed I didn’t go back to the woman who did my other tattoos,” says the 45-year-old, from south London. “I should have just stuck with her.” Today, he is getting two arrows, tattooed on his wrists, removed – they are too big. “I hated them the minute they were finished,” he says. Cazzetta’s next client is also someone who didn’t get the tattoo that she had in mind. “I had this whole idea of what I wanted it to look like,” says Gem Clay, a 26-year-old who works at a Lego Store and has travelled to London from Maidstone for the day. “But the artist didn’t do it like I thought it would be done. It was my first tattoo and I got really shy and said: ‘That’s fine, I love it.’” The tattoo in question is an orange maple leaf on her upper arm. Clay then added a rose to it, thinking she would like it more, but now she regrets that too, and wants both removed. This, says Brierly, is a common error. “My advice for anyone is that if you don’t like a tattoo, don’t cover it. Just get rid of it. Because it escalates. Some people get two cover-ups and then blackout over the top, and then take it off.” It’s best to treat a bad tattoo like a recipe that’s beyond saving: toss out the entire meal and start afresh, rather than trying to salvage it with additions.
Clay is in for a patch test, a legal prerequisite before she books an appointment. Cazzetta uses a laser on a portion of the tattoo, a small leaf. The laser bathes the room in a fluorescent gleam. The effect on the tattoo is remarkable: the green ink almost seems to foam, turning a cloudy yellow. Clay flinches as the laser drags the green ink to the surface of her skin: as it is her first session, she forgot to apply numbing cream. “It’s probably the most expensive tattoo I’ll ever have,” she says, “and I’m getting it removed.” Britain’s unquenchable enthusiasm for tattoos means Pulse Light Clinic is, for now, doing a roaring trade. Unless the tattoo is particularly large, most people are in and out within 15 minutes. The laser process itself takes barely any time at all – seconds, in some cases – and afterwards the area is dressed in bandages, to prevent infection and promote healing. Some people come to the clinic to have tattoos removed for professional reasons. Members of the army, cabin crew and makeup artists at upmarket department stores are all forbidden from having tattoos on display. “Sometimes clients don’t like it,” says the 30-year-old Venezuelan model Rotceh Perez, “and they have to Photoshop it out. But I didn’t really like the tattoo enough to keep it.” She’s having an angel removed from her ribs: this is her fourth session, and only a few traces of ink remain. Perez got the tattoo when she was 16. “I saw it as a kind of protection at the time,” she says. Her parents, predictably, were not thrilled. “Of course, they were mad,” she says. Now, she understands. “I will do the same with my children,” she says. “I’ll tell them: ‘Please don’t get a tattoo until you are at least 25. Then you can decide.’” Not everyone has the excuse of youth. Although a global pandemic is not a bad second. “I had coronavirus at the time,” says Tom (not his real name), a 25-year-old PR worker from London who prefers to remain anonymous, for reasons which will become clear. “I was locked in the house with the woman I was seeing at the time. And it was just a spur-of-the-moment decision. I think I was suffering from being in the house for 12 days.” Tom’s then-paramour tattooed the word ‘gravy’ on his left arm, using a needle. “I honestly can’t even remember the whole conversation [leading up to it],” says Tom. “I think it was more to do with the phrase ‘It’s all gravy’. Then I realised afterwards everyone will think I’m a northern boy – because northern boys love gravy.”
Cazzetta zaps his gravy into oblivion. “You see that blanching?” she says casually. “It’s because the laser is hot and it hits the ink and makes the ink hot. And then the steam comes up and blanches the skin white. It will go down after a few minutes.” Tom slinks off into central London once more, gravy diluted. Leaving the clinic, I can’t help but wish there was a PicoSure for all of our mistakes. Terrible boyfriend? Scald him away with a burst of concentrated light. Working in a career you hate? Laser those bosses into oblivion. Your regrets almost instantly fixed; vanished, as if they never happened. Until that day comes, tattoo removal is an option for our most visible errors of judgment. Just don’t forget the numbing cream.";https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/06/i-hated-it-the-minute-it-was-finished-bad-body-art-and-regrets-in-a-tattoo-removal-clinic;5
43;43;5283;5283;From corruption to the 'mark of the beast' – why countries like Malawi are struggling against Covid  | Madalitso Wills Kateta;2022-01-06T10:00:02Z;['Madalitso Wills Kateta'];['Malawi', 'Africa', 'World news', 'Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Health', 'Society'];"In January 2021, the Malawian rights activist Paul Msoma wrote that he was in Kamuzu central hospital, struggling to breathe. The hospital had oxygen cylinders but no flowmeters – the necessary instrument to connect him to them. I was left wondering where the funds that had been released for the country’s Covid-19 response were going. “My situation is getting bad and l desperately need oxygen,” Msoma wrote on Facebook. “Anyone who can urgently help out there please help by donating this very gadget.” Kamuzu central hospital is one of the biggest referral hospitals in Malawi and it did not seem right for such a big hospital not to have oxygen flowmeters, which are very basic medical equipment costing around £18 a piece. This was at a time when the government had released more than £5.6m for the Covid-19 response effort. Tragically, Msoma died a few days later. His call for help opened a can of worms and caused many to realise that these funds were being abused. Influential Malawians organised a citizen-led Covid-19 response and the government was brought to its senses, opening an inquiry into Covid-19 spending. An eventual report by the country’s office of the ombudsman following Nsoma’s comments indicated that 79.8% of the funds were misused, including money spent on non-Covid items like allowances for government officers. A later audit by the country’s auditor general confirmed the extensive abuse. But, to date, none of the officers involved in the abuse of the funds have been charged, despite the president, Lazarus Chakwera, promising that all those abusing these funds would face the law. The common belief on the street is that some of the people who misused the funds were politically connected government officials who could have been sharing the spoils with politicians. Meanwhile, as people were learning how the previous funds were used, Chakwera ordered another £15.8m – mostly from the Global Fund Covid-19 response mechanism and the IMF’s Rapid Credit Facility to help address the effects of the coronavirus – to be released. As it stands, people are still dying and the country doesn’t have vaccines to give its entire population. Malawi had, as of 2 January of this year, a total of 1,494,459 (7.6%) people with at least one vaccination, while just 712,848 (3.6%) have been fully vaccinated. Cumulatively the country has recorded 76,295 Covid-19 cases and 2,378 deaths, a 3.1% case fatality rate. The Covid response in Malawi has been greatly affected by rampant corruption. This affected not just procurement of vital items, but also areas like public awareness and outreach. Vaccine hesitancy is a massive problem. Currently, almost every major government hospital in Malawi including those in hard-to-reach areas has some vaccines but there are fears that even the current supply might not be fully utilised because of hesitancy. In May 2021 the country destroyed close to 20,000 doses of expired Covid-19 vaccines. This could have been better managed if funds for the epidemic response were properly used in the early stages of the disease’s spread. Much of the vaccine hesitancy in Malawi is being driven by religious beliefs, with some religious leaders telling followers the vaccines are prophesised in the Bible and are the starting stages of the branding of a “666” mark – the mark of the beast. They say every global citizen shall be required to have a mark in order to engage in any business. There is another myth that has been taking turns, where many women believe that the vaccines will make them infertile. It is difficult to reach and counter local misinformation, as 82.57% of Malawi’s population lives in rural areas, and about 65.8% of the population is literate. There currently seems to be more commitment by the country’s leadership to get the population vaccinated. The government, with support from different health organisations, has embarked on a nationwide campaign where people are being reached with mobile clinics within their communities and the result has been an uptick in vaccination.
The country’s health minister also recently announced that Covid-19 vaccination will become mandatory for some public servants such as police officers, health workers, teachers and journalists. But this has not gone down well with some rights groups, including the Malawi Human Rights Commission, which has argued against mandatory status on the grounds that vaccination should be a personal choice. The recent rise in vaccination is welcome and overdue. But there is still a need for active citizen participation to hold leaders accountable on how every penny of the country’s Covid response fund is being used, and to educate others on the dangers of the virus. This, however, isn’t going to be attainable until the country’s Anti-Corruption Bureau is adequately empowered, and Chakwera commits to full transparency for all Covid spending.

44;44;5284;5284;Crisis, what crisis? Florida Republicans deny Omicron is straining hospitals ;2022-01-06T10:00:01Z;['N/A'];['Florida', 'US news', 'US politics', 'Omicron variant', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Coronavirus'];"While Florida has experienced a record number of Covid-19 cases and sharp increase in hospitalizations in recent weeks, there is disagreement between Republicans and Democrats over whether the Omicron surge has actually overwhelmed the state’s healthcare system. For example, Florida Republican senator Marco Rubio posted on Twitter that there “is no Omicron hospital ‘surge’ in Florida. People admitted for non-Covid reasons get tested. If they test positive they get counted as a ‘Covid patient.’” Infectious disease experts and Florida hospital leaders say that – while there is some validity to the assessment that data showing an increase in Covid hospitalizations and cases can in part be attributed to increased testing – the state’s hospitals still face potentially serious staffing shortages. One hospital in the state had to close its maternity ward because of a Covid outbreak among staff. But in short, Florida has become a focal point of the often politicized debate over whether the Omicron variant is dangerous enough to overwhelm hospital systems and requires precautions taken earlier in the pandemic.
“I think there are certainly pressure points because of staffing challenges,” said Dr Joshua Lenchus, chief medical officer of Broward Health. “There has been a tremendous shift with nurses and respiratory therapists that have migrated to areas in greatest need and some areas that may compensate them better than other areas.” Florida, which its rightwing Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, touts as a place free of federal and other states’ draconian Covid-related restrictions, has seen a 566% increase in Covid cases over the past two weeks and a 246% increase in Covid hospitalizations during that time, according to data from the New York Times. Sixty-four percent of the state has been vaccinated against the virus, which is slightly higher than the country’s vaccination rate. DeSantis on Monday at a press conference described other states as “letting hysteria drive them to doing really damaging things”. While acknowledging a shortage in Covid tests, the governor and Florida’s surgeon general also said that people were testing themselves for the virus too much and that the state would issue new guidance on testing. “Without it, we’re going to be sort of stuck in the same cycle. So, it’s really time for people to be living, to make the decisions they want regarding vaccination, to enjoy the fact that many people have natural immunity,” said the state surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo. Florida Democrats blamed DeSantis for the fact that state residents have recently waited hours in line to get a Covid test. “We have not received any assistance from the state of Florida at our testing sites,” Mayor Jerry Demings of Orange county, a Democrat, said, according to NBC News. “Local governments have been left to figure it out and respond on our own. We are doing our best.” The testing shortage has also prompted some Florida residents to visit emergency rooms in search of tests. The Florida Hospital Association last week on Twitter urged people with mild or no symptoms not to visit emergency rooms for tests and instead find a testing site. “While facing the strain of workforce challenges, ERs are being put under increased pressure to provide care,” the organization stated. Lenchus, of Broward Health, attributes the demand for tests in emergency rooms to the long wait at testing sites and the fact that people don’t first turn to their primary care provider. “They show up at the emergency rooms thinking they are going to get a test,” said Lenchus. “Our hospital, as well as other hospitals, are not community testing sites. We have a limited supply of tests … like others do, and those tests should be reserved for people who are symptomatic and admitted to the hospital.” Still, Broward Health tests all patients who are admitted. While Rubio described some of the Covid hospitalization data as misleading, those tests are still important because not everyone presents with classic Covid symptoms – even though the virus could be the reason for the hospitalization – and the virus can complicate other diseases, said Dr Aileen Marty, an infectious disease expert at Florida International University. Even if a patient comes to the hospital for a different issue, a positive Covid test is important because “we have to treat that patient differently”, said Marty. The personal protective equipment “we use is different even if that person’s symptoms are not directly related to Covid”. Regardless of how representative the Covid infection and hospitalization numbers are of the scale of the problem in Florida, the virus continues to upend normal care and staffing. On 2 January, Holy Cross Health in Broward county had to shut down its labor and delivery unit because of staffing shortages due to people who became sick with the virus. Five patients have been transferred to Broward Health, and a number of other patients proactively changed their plans to physicians at the hospital, according to a Broward Health spokesperson. “There are still staffing challenges, and I think we as a healthcare community work together to ensure that the care of the community is still addressed,” said Lenchus. He and Marty both said they expected the wave to peak in the coming weeks. They are also waiting on state or federal government to provide additional monoclonal antibody treatments and Pfizer’s new antiviral pill. “I would imagine things perhaps could be better if the governor and the president played nicer together, but I would hope that as two professionals, they understand that protection of the public – which is in the oath that they swore when they took office – should take precedence over everything else,” said Lenchus. “And to their credit, when push comes to shove, when we do get into a crisis, perhaps there is some politicking, but they do come to the table and do what is right.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/florida-republicans-omicron-hospitals;7
45;45;5285;5285;At least 24 NHS trusts declare critical incidents due to Covid pressures;2022-01-06T09:55:52Z;['Aubrey Allegretti'];['NHS', 'Hospitals', 'Health', 'England', 'Coronavirus', 'Society', 'Grant Shapps', 'Infectious diseases', 'Politics', 'Health policy', 'Public services policy', 'UK news'];"More than one in six NHS trusts across England have declared a critical incident due to Covid pressures, a cabinet minister has revealed, saying the Omicron variant was putting “very real” pressure on the health service. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said ministers were trying to find the right compromise between imposing further restrictions and not allowing hospitals to be “overrun” given new cases of the virus have reached historically high levels. Of England’s 137 NHS trusts, at least 24 have declared a critical incident, Shapps said, meaning they have reached an alert level signalling priority services may be under threat. He added it was “crazy” some people were still not getting vaccinated given the increased protection a booster jab offers against the Omicron variant, but that the government would not take the “draconian approach” of making vaccines mandatory. Shapps told Sky News it was “not entirely unusual” for NHS trusts to “go critical over the winter – often with things like the flu pandemic”, but conceded “there are very real pressures which I absolutely recognise”. Plan B, which came into force last month across England with a return to work-from-home advice, face coverings and the introduction of Covid passes, was still the right way forward, Shapps said. He faced down criticism that England is out of step with the three other UK nations, which all imposed tougher restrictions in the light of the more transmissible variant. Shapps said: “What we want to do is steer the country through the Omicron wave, and I think plan B has so far been shown to be the right way forward – not shutting down the country yet again with all the costs to people’s mental health and elsewhere.”
Hospitalisations have been slower to rise than Covid cases, with ministers buoyed by the booster rollout. A further 967 people went into hospital with the virus, according to the latest daily figure published on Wednesday, taking the total to 17,276 – the highest since last February. However, the issue has been compounded further by NHS staff being among the hundreds of thousands of people self-isolating due to the rapidly increasing number of Covid cases. A further 194,747 infections were reported on Wednesday, one of the highest on record since the pandemic began. Jon Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said it was vital key workers – including NHS staff – got access to lateral flow tests that enable double-vaccinated people to end their isolation early from day seven if they test negative twice. He said there had been “problems with the supply” and added: “Ministers have really got to get a grip of that.” Some restrictions on travel have been lifted, with the requirement for all those arriving in England to get a pre-departure PCR test now scrapped. Shapps said travel restrictions were always temporary and that PCR-testing everyone who entered the country to check if they had Omicron was no longer necessary, given it is now the dominant variant in the UK and spreading fast in many other parts of the world. He said the previous testing rule had “effectively outlived its usefulness when it comes to travel”. • This article was amended on 7 January 2022 to remove a graphic.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/06/nhs-trusts-england-critical-incidents-covid-pressures-omicron;7
46;46;5286;5286;MPs call for urgent action to tackle NHS England waiting list;2022-01-06T09:50:58Z;['Alexandra Topping'];['Health policy', 'NHS', 'Coronavirus', 'Health', 'Politics', 'House of Commons', 'UK news', 'Social care', 'Hospitals'];"Plans to tackle the “catastrophic impact” of the Covid pandemic on patients in England waiting for NHS treatment could be derailed by emergency care demands and a lack of staff, MPs have said. With about 6 million people already waiting for planned treatment, the backlog caused by the pandemic is a major and “unquantifiable” challenge as more people seek care, according to the cross-party health and social care committee. A record number of 999 calls and long waits to be seen in A&E, coupled with an increase in the number of people waiting for planned care could result in an “entirely predictable staffing crisis” as burned-out staff quit the NHS. In its report, the committee calls for a wide-ranging national health and care recovery plan encompassing emergency care, mental health, GPs, community care and social care. The committee chair, Jeremy Hunt, also called for short-term measures to tackle the crisis. “We need to go a lot further. We’ve got 6 million people on the waiting list, we’ve got a crisis in our A&E departments, a record number of 999 calls, double the referrals to children and young people’s mental health in some areas,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on Thursday. “We don’t have […] a workforce plan that says how we are going to get these 4,000 doctors, and unless we do that we’re going to find this incredible frustration from taxpayers’ point of view that they’re putting the money in but they’re not getting the results out that they were promised.” The report states that of the 5.8 million patients who were waiting to start treatment in September 2021, 300,000 had been waiting more than a year and 12,000 more than two years.
MPs said government promises to carry out 9m extra checks, scans and operations would not be deliverable “without better short and long-term workforce planning”. The report noted that there were 93,000 vacancies for NHS positions and “shortages in nearly every specialty”, while there were 105,000 vacancies and a turnover rate of 28.5% in social care. Although the health secretary, Sajid Javid, had promised a plan would be produced by the end of November 2021, the report said NHS England had yet to publish details. “We remain unconvinced there are sufficient plans for recruitment and retention of staff,” said the report. MPs had previously called for short and long-term workforce projections, but plans to enshrine the requirement in law had been voted down by the government, and without that information it was “impossible for anyone” to know if enough doctors, nurses and care staff were being trained.
“This creates a gap between ministerial rhetoric about supporting frontline staff and refusal in practice to do the biggest single long-term change that would relieve the pressure they face,” the MPs said. While use of the private sector to tackle the backlog was broadly welcomed, the report noted that it risked exacerbating existing health inequalities, as private hospitals tended to be in more affluent areas, whereas waiting lists were biggest in more deprived areas. The report warned against a target culture which could compromise quality and patient safety, and the efficacy of encouraging people to call 111 for urgent but non-life threatening medical need as no evaluation had been carried out. Dr David Wrigley, the British Medical Association’s deputy council chair, said the report exposed the “gargantuan challenge” facing the NHS. “The biggest barrier to tackling the backlog caused by the pandemic is a severe staffing crisis and our calls for improved workforce planning have thankfully been heard. It’s now time for the government to listen too.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/06/mps-call-for-urgent-action-to-tackle-nhs-treatment-waiting-list;5

48;48;5288;5288;Wendy and Peter Pan review – swashbuckling bombast, darkness and laughs;2022-01-06T09:34:56Z;['Nick Ahad'];"['Theatre', ""Children's theatre"", 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Family', 'JM Barrie']";"A witty retelling of a classic that leaves no buckle unswashed and no wink to the adults unwinked, this is the kind of production that, in a normal year, would have played to packed houses over the festive season. That this isn’t a normal year means that vacant seats in the auditorium and masks on the faces of those in seats that are occupied create a more subdued atmosphere than this hugely energetic and entertaining production deserves. But it is still a show that will surely make theatre lovers out of youngsters experiencing the art form for the first time. Adapter Ella Hickson wrings out the humour in every corner of the script, from an unrequited love story between Smee and Captain Hook to near-the-knuckle jokes about the anatomical logistics of how exactly a fairy might end up on top of a tree and, more importantly, stay there. Taking JM Barrie’s original story and centring Wendy Darling in it is a smart move from Hickson and one that Amber James exploits to the full, playing the Darling girl like Dawn French in her pomp. Her counterpart, Pierro Niel-Mee, gives us a Peter Pan that is one part Rik Mayall’s Lord Flashheart with a generous helping of Robin Williams as he played the role in Hook, Steven Spielberg’s 1991 telling of the story.
It’s a modern sensibility that works for a script that is Pixarian in its ability to appeal to all ages: those who grew up with The Simpsons will look at Smee and think Smithers, while the youngsters on whom those jokes are lost will surely simply marvel at the spectacular stage fights. Jonathan Munby, who directed the original version of this for the RSC in 2013, throws everything at this, alongside co-director Rupert Hands, staging the piece with huge bombast while not shying away from the story’s dark undertones of death and grief. The production, which was staged at the Tokyo Olympics, has been hit by delays to the set arriving from Japan and cancellations caused by cases of Covid among the cast over Christmas. It has been entirely worth the wait. Wendy and Peter Pan is at Leeds Playhouse until 22 January.";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/06/wendy-and-peter-pan-review-leeds-playhouse;1
49;49;5289;5289;One of the few black female QCs in England and Wales calls for action on inequality;2022-01-06T09:19:07Z;['Haroon Siddique'];['Race', 'Barristers', 'Law', 'England', 'Wales', 'UK news', 'Inequality', 'Discrimination at work'];One of the few black female QCs in England and Wales has said the time has come for action and “no more talk” when it comes to tackling race inequality in the legal profession. Barbara Mills, who is co-chair of the Bar Council’s race working group, said the next 12 months would be “critical” to tackling systemic obstacles at the bar. These were identified in the group’s landmark Race at the Bar report, which found that there were just five black female QCs (senior barristers, also known as silks) in England and Wales (another two were announced in the latest appointments, published on 22 December). Another stark statistic was that a black female junior barrister with the same level of experience as a white male junior billed £18,700 a year less on average, and an Asian woman £16,400 less. Elsewhere, the judiciary said only 1% of judges in courts and tribunals were black, a figure that is unchanged since 2014 Mills says there had been “well-meaning people” in the profession but a more strategic approach was required to boost diversity. “If, in a year’s time – I shouldn’t say if – when, in a year’s time, we have … all sorts of stakeholders with clearly defined targets, which we can then work to and then hold them to account, that would be real progress,” said Mills. “The system didn’t get like this overnight and none of us can hope that the change will be overnight but what the race working group members and our brown and black colleagues are expecting is a sense, a feeling of visibility, that it’s changing – no more talk, just change it and let me see that it’s changing. So, I think the next 12 months are critical.” Mills said the fact that the race working group even existed, and racial inequality was being talked about openly within the profession, showed progress since she was first called to the bar in 1990. But the next step required targets – not to be confused with quotas – to pave the way for tangible action, she said. She shied away from discussing her own experience, instead focusing on “holding my hand out as I climb up”. But Mills is under no illusions about her own visibility as a black female QC, given that by comparison there are 1,303 white men and 286 white women who are silks, according to the report, which used figures calculated before the latest round of appointments. “I was really struck when I took silk,” she said. “My inbox was flooded with messages from black women who I didn’t know who were either students or young barristers, who said: ‘Oh, my God, it’s possible. Thank you, thank you for making it look and be possible.’” Targets for QCs from minority-ethnic backgrounds, as well as for appointments to the judiciary and panels, are one of a raft of recommendations in the Race at the Bar report, which focuses on access to the profession, retention, progress and culture. Mills said those asking if there was really a problem were in the minority and she “can’t understand or believe that anybody doubts the value of diversity any more”. She said: “You can’t have a system whereby in something as fundamental and as important to people as the legal system, there are those in society who think there’s an ‘us and them’ going on. It can’t be. You can’t have a system where people think: well, the person who will represent me, has no idea of my life, my culture, my heritage, what makes me me, the person who’s going to make a life-altering decision, has no idea of my culture, of who I am. That just doesn’t instil the sort of confidence in the decision-making that we require.”;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/inequality-legal-profession-england-and-wales-barbara-mills-qc;2
50;50;5290;5290;US troops in Okinawa placed under tighter Covid rules as cases rise;2022-01-06T09:17:59Z;['Justin McCurry'];['Japan', 'Coronavirus', 'US military', 'Asia Pacific', 'US news', 'World news'];US troops in Okinawa prefecture will be subject to additional Covid tests and have been reminded to wear masks off base amid criticism that military authorities failed to tackle a fresh outbreak among service personnel that has taken hold among the local civilian population in Japan. Okinawa is at the centre of the country’s latest outbreak, with cases surging in recent days from 51 on Saturday to at least 980 on Thursday – a record daily caseload for the southern island. Those figures omit infections among American troops but include those among Japanese citizens who work at US bases. An off-base mask requirement was already in place for personnel – irrespective of their vaccination status. But local US forces issued a strong reminder amid reports that servicemen and women had been spotted without face coverings, along with new measures in an attempt to prevent virus transmission. The move came after the foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, called for US personnel to be confined to their bases in a telephone call with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Hayashi “strongly requested the strengthening of measures to prevent an expansion in infections”, according to Japan’s foreign ministry, adding that he had asked Blinken to consider restricting outings by US troops “to ease worries among local residents”. The chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said he was “gravely concerned” about outbreaks at American military facilities. Japan’s government is poised to announce new Covid-19 measures in Okinawa in the coming days after a request on Thursday from its governor. “If we all work together, we hope cases will come down,” Denny Tamaki told reporters. Tamaki said this week he was “furious” at US military authorities over the “alarming rise” in cases – including those involving the Omicron variant – on Okinawa, host to more than half of the 47,000 American troops based in Japan. The expected quasi-state of emergency in Okinawa could include shorter opening hours for bars and restaurants. Tamaki has promised financial aid for businesses that comply with the restrictions. The measures would be the first in Japan since late September, when restrictions were lifted after a dramatic fall in new Covid-19 infections. Officials in Hiroshima prefecture said they would also request a quasi-state of emergency. The mask requirement – in a country where most people voluntarily wear face coverings – applies to other US bases in Japan, home to more than 100,000 service members, dependents and contractors. Late last year, Japan banned all overseas arrivals apart from Japanese citizens and returning foreign residents in an attempt to prevent the spread of Omicron. But US forces are able to enter the country and move about freely under a bilateral security agreement. US Forces in Japan (USFJ) has reported a total of 1,784 cases among personnel and their families, with about a third of them in Okinawa. The Iwakuni marine corps base in south-western Japan has reported 529 cases. USFJ said personnel must test negative for Covid-19 before leaving their base, adding that masks must also be worn on base until a negative test result is confirmed. Until recently, the US military did not adhere to Japan’s policy of testing incoming travellers for the virus on arrival and requiring them to quarantine for two weeks. The USFJ said it “now requires no less than three negative Covid-19 tests upon travelling to Japan” including one within 24 hours of arrival. “The mitigation measures we have instituted throughout USFJ are intended to protect our force’s readiness, the wellbeing of our families, and the health of Japan’s citizens,” it said. “We recognise we all have a part to play in keeping our communities safe.” Japan’s infection rate remains comparatively low, with just over 2,600 cases reported on Wednesday. But the numbers are rising, and Wednesday marked the first time that cases had exceeded 2,000 for more than three months. This article and headline was amended on 11 and 12 January 2022 to clarify that US military personnel had already been required to wear masks off base before US Forces in Japan announced additional measures, and to change some references from “soldiers” to “troops”.

51;51;5291;5291;‘We await the champion’: how Novak Djokovic’s Australian Open trip went from elation to detention;2022-01-06T09:13:09Z;['Cait Kelly'];['Novak Djokovic', 'Melbourne', 'Tennis', 'Sport', 'Australia news', 'Australian politics', 'Australian immigration and asylum'];"Novak Djokovic’s Australian Open journey started in comfort, and excitement. A photo showed the tennis star with a huge grin on his face, bags packed, as he boarded his Emirates flight from Dubai. “Let’s go 2022!” he posted to Instagram. But it ended with him trapped in an immigration hotel infamous for detaining refugees, caught in the middle of a diplomatic stoush between Serbia and Australia and a fight over his deportation playing out in the federal court.
The news that the world No 1, who refuses to reveal his vaccine status, was en route to Australia enraged many. Melbourne was one of the most locked down cities in the world, and the Covid vaccine is mandated in the majority of its workplaces. Many residents questioned why Tennis Australia and the Victorian government were allowing an unvaccinated sports star to play.
But after touching down in Melbourne about 11.30pm local time, Djokovic never made it through arrivals. Australian Border Force officials stopped him after it emerged that his team had applied for a visa that does not allow medical exemptions. In a statement, the ABF confirmed Djokovic did not meet the entry requirements and his visa was cancelled. “Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa cancelled will be detained and removed from Australia,” the statement said. As Djokovic waited alone in an airport room, the arrivals lounge filled up with media and a small number of fans. One stood in the middle of the arrival gate, waving a Serbian flag.
Slobodan Bendjo and Krstomir Dusanovic had been waiting at Melbourne airport since midnight, ready to welcome the tennis star. Armed with an accordion and a Serbian flag, the pair were walking around the airport playing music.
“We are here to await the champion,” Dusanovic said. They were not deterred by the fact the tennis star was being told to leave Australia, they said. “We’ve still here to welcome him,” Bendjo said. “He’s just here somewhere behind these walls – he’s not far away from us. “We always, when he comes here, welcome him with music. It’s a traditional thing you do. We think it’s important we continue with the tradition.”
A young fan, Andrew Mitrovic wandered in with his mum. He held a makeshift sign that said “free Nole”. They had brought tickets to see Djokovic play and were devastated he hadn’t been allowed in. About 10am, he was moved to the Park hotel in Carlton, an infamous immigration detention hotel. It houses 36 refugees – some of whom have been detained for nine years. The windows in the hotel can’t be opened – they have been sealed shut and there was recently a Covid outbreak among the detainees. An unusual crew of Djokovic supporters, refugee advocates and anti-vaxxers gathered outside the hotel.
Husband and wife Ziggy and Billy Misovic came down to show their support for the tennis star. Waving a flag from Djokovic’s home town, Belgrade, they yelled “free Novak”. “We came to support the number one,” Billy said. “It’s ridiculous, he’s got an exemption, why not let him in?” Asked about his vaccination status, Ziggy said: “It’s a private matter. Do I ask if you have Aids? It’s private.” Billy said they understood the frustration of Victorians but that Djokovic had been “humiliated”.
“My father passed away two years ago. He was in Serbia. The borders were closed, I understand [the frustration],” she said. Refugee Advocate Jenny Leah said she came every day to show her support and had never seen this many members of the media. “There are dozens of media here today, we are here every day – we get a lot of support from passing motorists, tram drivers, but never any media,” she said. “To us, it says something about the priorities of the media, and public.” The refugees are not allowed on the roof for fresh air and have recently reported finding maggots and mould in their food. Some of them have recently been released on bridging visas but the future of those left inside is unknown. Leah said Djokovic would receive very different treatment: “He’ll get to leave.”
As the afternoon wore on, a slow stream of Djokovic’s supporters from Australia’s Serbian community came out to show their solidarity. They played Serbian music, danced and one zoomed around on a scooter yelling.
Sandra Milisic, draped in a Serbian flag, said Djokovic deserved “respect”. “If this was an issue to begin with, they should have knocked him back beforehand. He deserves the respect, considering he has given support to Australia during the bushfires,” she said. During a lull in festivities from Djokovic supporters, refugee advocates climbed on top of the roof and, with huge banners, chanted “free the refugees”. A refugee in the window above them holds up nine fingers, for the number of years he has been detained. One Djokovic supporter cut through the crowd to say: “I feel so ignorant. I came here for him, and find out they’ve been locked up for nine years. It’s so wrong.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/06/we-await-the-champion-how-novak-djokovics-australian-open-trip-went-from-elation-to-detention;4
52;52;5292;5292;Tides by Sara Freeman review – an experimental study of grief;2022-01-06T09:00:00Z;['N/A'];['Fiction', 'Books', 'Culture'];"Each page of Sara Freeman’s debut novel holds a slim paragraph, two at most. And if there are two paragraphs on one page, then these are divided by the symbol of a crescent moon, so that at no point is any section of text close to touching another. At all moments, the writing in Tides has to contend with an expanse of vacant space. The experience of reading such a novel is like travelling through a series of expertly designed studio flats. You marvel at every interior you come to: a whole unto itself, not a foot wrong in the design. But then you turn the page and enter yet another four walls, the last beginning to fade from your mind. Only at the end are you able to conceive of all these paragraphs at once, imagine a whole tower block of crafted text. Prior to the novel’s start, Mara, the main character, underwent the tragedy of a stillbirth. After that, she could no longer endure any of the relationships that bordered that terrible experience – not with her husband, nor her brother, his wife and their new baby, who lived on the floor below her apartment, “their joy so firmly lodged beneath her grief”. And so she boards a bus that will take her far away, to an American seaside town: 2,353 inhabitants, a few shops, hostels, then the bay and the water beyond that. For much of the novel, she drifts from place to place, staying at various hostels, spending nights passed out blind drunk on the beach or with strange men – before she finds more permanent residence in the disused attic of a wine shop, where she has got herself a temporary job. Freeman’s chosen form, then, acts as a visual manifestation of her protagonist’s state: her refusal of proximity, her abnegation of all those people and places that had previously been contiguous to her life. Now, nothing can touch her, nothing must last. All the places she ends up in feel as interstitial as the paragraphs themselves, the attic “a square of dispossessed land” from which, after each night, “she sets to work on erasing the signs of her own presence”. This mirroring of structure and plot is smart. It can be very effective. But it also feels too artificial, too neat, to the extent that it draws attention away from the plot and towards its own ingenuity. It is an example of American literary critic and poet Yvor Winters’s “fallacy of imitative form”, his attack on modernist poetry wherein the “form succumbs to the raw material of the poem”, weakening both the poem’s ability to convey its meaning and the form itself. Freeman has suggested that Tides started as an exploration of intense sibling relationships and the way these come to seem abnormal if they continue into adulthood. As children, Mara and her younger brother Paul were inseparable (character names, as well as events occurring before the time of the novel, are drip-fed to the reader, Mara’s life a landscape under fog gradually burning away until the past is at last a clear day). Paul’s first word was “Mara”. Hers was “mine”. She carried him everywhere she went. As such, Mara has found it hard to accept Paul’s marriage, the way “every bit of life has been collectivised, their knowing too. Two skulls pressed together: two wills collapsed.” The subtle violence of the imagery perfectly expresses her abject horror at seeing her brother wrenched from her and becoming conjoined with another. Throughout Tides, there is play between singular and plural pronouns – Mara’s fear of becoming a “we” once more, and her equivalent terror at remaining an “I”. The slow revelation of the depth to which Paul and Mara were previously enmeshed is the strongest, most disturbing aspect of the book, and what makes it live in spite of its fragmented form. Freeman hammers her paragraphs down into perfected, indivisible units, without any bulk or extraneous matter. When it works, her images are light as gas. Naturally, there is an abundance of water-related imagery. After several months in the town, Mara realises no one has come to save her. “The fact solidifies beneath her, a layer of black ice under every thought.” And then, as she begins to come back to herself, in part because of a relationship with someone new, “there is summer right beneath, a current of it under a thin layer of ice”. This lover describes to her the inner workings of the tides, their “rush and release of water”, but she knows what she will remember from the conversation is not the tides’ mechanism, but “the tendon in his neck straining as he talks, the clavicle lifting like a lock”. Each image is eloquently expressed, but when it becomes the only thought on a page, without other images to jostle against, it loses its vitality. In a 2010 interview, Don DeLillo described how he limits himself to one paragraph per page when drafting his novels. It allows him to see more clearly the shape of the words. But in their final form, those paragraphs are brought back into colloquy with one another. As with stanza breaks, readers intuitively make something of these divisions; they do not require the separation of a whole page to understand the rupture that might have occurred in time, in thought, in feeling. In Tides, the splitting of paragraphs between pages does not become more than a formal pretension, one that slows down and makes less coherent an otherwise very strange and poignant novel. • Lamorna Ash’s Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town is published by Bloomsbury.

53;53;5293;5293;The 400 Blows review – François Truffaut’s coming-of-age masterwork;2022-01-06T09:00:00Z;['Peter Bradshaw'];['Film', 'Drama films', 'Francois Truffaut', 'World cinema', 'Culture'];"François Truffaut’s sublime autobiographical debut is now rereleased, a portrait of the artist as an unhappy child. He deserved every prize going simply for those heartstopping images of the children’s faces as they watch a Punch and Judy show. This is its first release in the UK since 2009, but maybe 62 years is now enough perspective to see fully how the grim scenes of home life and school life, which would have been accepted as contemporary realism in 1959 and for years afterwards, now look like historical documents. The title itself, from faire les quatre cent coups, means to hand out punishment, raise hell, sow wild oats – but this is an ironic upending. Truffaut’s alter ego, Antoine Doinel, is receiving the blows. They rain down on him. Cruelty and humiliation and desperation – and defiance – are this kid’s destiny.
Jean-Pierre Léaud played the 12-year-old lead in this and the five successive Doinel films, a role which was to define his entire life. Like Truffaut, Doinel is a truant, a delinquent, a kid from an unhappy home and a thief: he steals money, a bottle of milk, a typewriter and, most importantly of all, a piece of writing. For a class assignment, he plagiarises, or at any rate paraphrases, a passage from Balzac’s Quest of the Absolute from 1834, about the death of the alchemist Balthazar Claes, repurposing it for the supposed death of his own grandfather. Doinel even has a candlelit shrine to Balzac in the cramped family apartment, which almost burns the place down. But Doinel has a tyrannical and narrow-minded schoolteacher (veteran player Guy Decomble, resembling Maigret with his coat and pipe) who is nicknamed petite feuille – little leaf – and is a petty little pedant. Instead of applauding Doinel’s good taste and even conceding that this semi-larceny shows audacity and imagination, this man is simply satisfied with his own cleverness at spotting the borrowing and punishes the boy. It is the ultimate mortification.
Doinel knows that his mother, the brassy Gilberte (Claire Maurier), is unfaithful to his jokey, affectionate stepfather Julien (Albert Rémy); he has seen her kissing a man in the street and knows that gifts of money may be involved. So when he pretends that his mother is dead as a bizarre excuse to explain one truancy – a grotesque lie for which Julien comes to school with his still living mother and slaps Doinel’s face in front of his class – it is clearly an act of matricidal wish-fulfilment of some sort. Doinel bunks off school, roaming all around town and of course going to the movies. But despite what is perpetually written about The 400 Blows, movies are not overwhelmingly important to Doinel. They do not “save” him the way they really did save the young cinephile Truffaut, whose friendship and mentorship with critic and intellectual André Bazin meant that he was spared dire punishment for desertion during national service. Doinel spends more of his time ranging far afield outside the cinema: in real life, in the streets of Paris. But there is one in-joke: his parents take him to the movies to see Jacques Rivette’s Paris Belongs to Us (which was not actually released until 1961, two years after The 400 Blows). Maybe Doinel is Truffaut’s alternative-reality version of himself: a self without the redemption of cinema, his abortive Balzac homage standing for the loss of art. With Gilberte’s shrugging permission, Doinel is sent to juvenile detention, put in police custody with grownup criminals and ladies of the night and then the psychological “observation unit” out in the country near the coast. That brings us to the final, almost apocalyptic scene on the beach, where Doinel has ended up after running away from reform school. We know that he has never seen the sea. So how does he feel on seeing it now the first time? Does it look like freedom to him? Or another blank wall? When Truffaut freeze-frames on Doinel’s face at the very end, it shows him looking careworn and haggard for the first time: the freeze-frame has captured the moment at which the boy has become a man. This is the 401st blow – aimed at us. • The 400 Blows is released on 7 January in cinemas.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/the-400-blows-review-francois-truffaut;5
54;54;5294;5294;Novak Djokovic to remain in detention during court challenge to Australian visa cancellation;2022-01-06T08:50:52Z;['Royce Kurmelovs', 'Emma Kemp'];['Novak Djokovic', 'Australian Open', 'Australia sport', 'Australian Open 2022', 'Tennis', 'Sport', 'Australia news'];"Novak Djokovic is awaiting his Australian Open fate in a Melbourne immigration hotel as the world No 1 mounts a legal challenge against Australia’s a decision to cancel his visa Djokovic’s lawyers succeeded in a bid to stop him from being deported on Thursday with a full hearing in the federal circuit court now scheduled for Monday. The tennis champion spent eight hours detained at Melbourne airport overnight before Australian Border Force officials announced he had been denied entry into the country on Thursday morning. They cited a failure to meet Australia’s Covid vaccination exemption requirements.
It is understood the reigning Australian Open champion was relying on a previous Covid infection as the basis for his exemption to compete – but that is not recognised by the federal government.
After unsuccessfully pleading his case at the airport, Djokovic was transported to an immigration hotel in the inner Melbourne suburb of Carlton. As the political and diplomatic ramifications unfurled, Djokovic’s lawyers were working to obtain an interim injunction to stop his deportation. In a snap hearing before judge Anthony Kelly on Thursday evening, it was agreed a full hearing between the player and the home affairs minister would be heard on Monday. Djokovic cannot be deported before that hearing. The parties are due to submit evidence and submissions over the weekend. The court heard Tennis Australia had said it would need to know whether Djokovic could compete by Tuesday for scheduling purposes. The judge asked whether Djokovic could be moved to a hotel with a tennis court so he could practice. Kelly said he would try to accommodate the parties to come to a resolution but stressed the court would not be rushed. “The tail won’t be wagging the dog here,” Kelly said. “If Tennis Australia decides to do what it wants to do in running its enterprise, it will. All I can do is provide every facility available to this court to assist these parties to resolve it in the best way possible.”
The legal challenge could go all the way to the high court but there are just 11 days before Djokovic is due to start his campaign for a record 21st grand slam title at Melbourne Park. “People must be fully vaccinated as defined by Atagi [the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation] to gain quarantine-free entry into Australia,” the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Thursday. “That means people who do not meet the definition will not be approved for quarantine-free entry. “I am advised that such an exemption was not in place and as a result he [Djokovic] is subject to the same rule as anyone else. This is nothing about any one individual, it is simply a matter of following the rules, and so those processes will take their course over the next few hours and that event will play out as it should.”
The ABC reported on Thursday night that border force officials were also investigating another tennis player and an official granted medical exemptions by Tennis Australia. Djokovic’s predicament has become the epicentre of a political tit-for-tat between Morrison’s federal administration and Daniel Andrews’s state government in Victoria. The Serbian travelled to Australia after receiving an exemption from Tennis Australia and the Victorian government to compete. It was granted following a process that included assessment by two panels of health experts. Djokovic had expected that exemption would – along with his federal government-issued visa – allow him to play at the Australian Open. On arrival, however, border force officials at the airport said Djokovic was unable to justify the grounds for his exemption. Morrison said on Thursday that Tennis Australia had been advised several months ago that a recent infection did not meet the criteria for an exemption to enter Australia unvaccinated.
Tennis Australia and Victorian government officials said Djokovic, who has won nine titles at Melbourne Park including the last three, received no preferential treatment, adding he was among “a handful” of the 26 people who applied who were approved in an anonymous and independent process. Later on Thursday, the Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said Djokovic’s visa was not the state’s responsibility. “Someone issued Novak Djokovic a visa and it wasn’t the Victorian government,” Foley said. “What the Victorian government has done, what Tennis Australia has done, is acted within the law of the land.”
Mary Anne Kenny, an associate professor of law at Murdoch University, said entry into Australia required a visa and an individual exemption as an unvaccinated person. “Our laws are very byzantine, they’re very difficult to navigate and how they interact is pretty unclear,” Kenny said. “I do think it’s unfortunate it wasn’t sorted out before he got here. The minister has very broad power for [visa] cancellation. They can cancel for all sorts of reasons.”
Carina Ford, an immigration lawyer who has represented the Biloela family, suggested there were three things Djokovic needed to enter the country. “He needed a visa, he needed a travel exemption at the commonwealth level and he needed a travel exemption from Victoria because of the fact he is unvaccinated,” Ford said. “Victoria might have granted an exemption from hotel quarantine … but the travel exemption is a commonwealth issue.” The saga, fuelled by domestic political point-scoring about the country’s handling of a record surge in new Omicron infections, has created an international incident, with the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, claiming harassment of its star player. “I’ve just finished my telephone conversation with Novak Djokovic,” Vučić posted on Instagram. “I told our Novak that the whole of Serbia is with him and that our bodies are doing everything to see that the harassment of the world’s best tennis player is brought to an end immediately. In line with all norms of international law, Serbia will fight for Novak, truth and justice.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/06/novak-djokovic-to-challenge-australian-visa-cancellation-in-federal-court;4

I saw this young palmate newt emerging on the evening of 1 January. Newts should be overwintering in leaf and log piles, compost heaps and other suitable refugia from November until late February or early March, when they start moving toward breeding pools. It is troubling to spot this individual within the overwintering period. The unseasonably warm weather fooled a great deal of species into early emergence: it places them in great peril if they expend energy in an attempt to feed out of season, burn fat reserves and expose themselves to short daylight hours and cold nights that could result in their deaths. Jonathan Davies, 32, certified passive house designer, St Fagans, Cardiff ‘We’ve seen butterflies early in previous years but never daisies’
One of several daisies in my garden, photographed on New Year’s Day. I’ve never seen this before. The part of the garden where the daisy is growing doesn’t get much light as it’s shaded by a tall hedge to the south and west. Usually the grass is all that’s on show until much later (March). I’m curious about the early appearance of this species – we’ve seen butterflies very early in previous years, but never daisies. I don’t know what to think about this occurrence in relation to the health of the environment. We have had an exceptionally mild winter, the soil is not especially cold or hard, but the absence of activity in other species seems strange. Anonymous, Redlynch, Wiltshire ‘The bees are using up their winter stores’
This photo was taken in my garden on 29 December. Usually in winter the bees form a cluster around the queen while flexing their flight muscles, without beating their wings, to generate adequate heat. With minimal movement their stores of honey and nectar are usually sufficient till the weather warms up in spring. It’s mid-winter in Ireland and yet the bees are surprisingly busy and returning to the hives with pollen and nectar. It’s more like what one would expect in mid-spring at the earliest. This level of activity unfortunately leads the bees to use up their winter stores too quickly, and if late spring brings cold and frosty weather right into May (as happened here last year), then starvation becomes a serious threat to the bees. Of course, as beekeepers we can intervene by providing food for our bees to help them along. Unfortunately this can’t be done for bees of all kinds in the wild who are struggling to survive as the climate changes. All of this is concerning as pollinators of all kinds are in decline and this has huge negative implications for food production worldwide. Niall Keogh, retired teacher, Killarney, Ireland ‘I’ve never seen daffodil shoots this early’
This picture of a daffodil shoot was taken at a sheltered spot under a bay window in our front garden in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. I’d just been on my traditional New Year’s Day walk with friends in Sutton Park and I spotted these exceptional shoots of spring on our return. I was very surprised to see the shoots. I’ve never seen them this early; they usually appear in March. As an active member of our local Eco Sutton group, my surprise was undercut with a deep concern at what is happening to the environment in front of our eyes. Antony Whitehead, retired architect, Sutton Coldfield ‘Coming across a bee this early is part of a pattern’
In the Duke’s Garden at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, we saw this bee, on 3 January, tucking into a winter flowering shrub. Snowdrops and narcissi were coming out last week, the magnolias are in bud, but a bee? Elsewhere in Kew we could see buds and catkins, much earlier than in previous years. Most walks in January see us muffled up against a biting chill, but today was very pleasant with a little sunshine. Last year, I recall seeing goslings in February on a snowy morning. So, yes, seeing a bee at this time is not normal, but it is part of a pattern. While any sign that the winter is coming to a close is welcome, the implication that this is evidence of climate change – a process which appears to be accelerating – is worrying. Tony Hutchinson, 67, working in social housing and regeneration, Brentford, London ‘I was expecting them to sprout much later’
I planted some bulbs and seeds in pots on our terrace in November, and to my surprise they had already started sprouting by New Year’s Day. I suppose I was expecting them much later, perhaps in a few weeks at the earliest. The funny thing is I have no idea what I planted, so we’ll be looking out for a surprise display of flowers in a couple of months. I’m a bit worried they might not do so well if there’s a frost later in the month or in February. Vita Moltedo, 48, Islington, London ‘I was worried the ducklings might not survive through cold and lack of food’
On 28 December, I saw ducklings at Bingham’s Pond in the west end of Glasgow. Last year, the ducklings hatched in April. I was surprised to see so many in winter and worried that they might not survive due to lack of food and low temperatures. I wonder if it was the very mild weather that prompted the early laying and hatching. If the milder winter becomes more common, or the temperature drops later into winter, will it have an impact on duck and wild fowl numbers? Hopefully she’ll have another clutch in the spring anyway.

56;56;5296;5296;Wilson to the Browns? Rodgers in Denver? A look at the quarterback merry-go-round;2022-01-06T08:30:03Z;['Oliver Connolly'];['NFL', 'Seattle Seahawks', 'Green Bay Packers', 'Cleveland Browns', 'Pittsburgh Steelers', 'New Orleans Saints', 'Denver Broncos', 'Carolina Panthers', 'US sports', 'Sport', 'Aaron Rodgers'];"Last year the player empowerment movement that has swept across sports finally arrived in the huddle. Quarterbacks throughout the NFL started to flex their power. Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Matthew Stafford, and Deshaun Watson all suggested (or demanded) trades; all four were stars at the peak of their powers. It will be much the same this summer. Rodgers, Wilson and Watson will be joined in trade discussions by Kirk Cousins and Matt Ryan, and the domino effect of any moves will be felt around the league. Some decisions have already been reported. The Giants are intent on riding the Joe Judge-Daniel Jones partnership over the waterfall. The Dolphins have been the most active team in pursuit of Watson. If that plan comes to nothing, they will continue to build around Tua Tagovailoa. The Falcons should stick with Ryan, rather than jumping into a rebuild of their own. So, let’s play pin the trade on the quarterback – a quick note that these are fun trades we think should happen rather than ones we think will happen. Aaron Rodgers to the Denver Broncos Who knows what Aaron Rodgers will do? He could stay with the Packers. He could walk away from the game altogether. Most likely: He pushes through a trade away from Green Bay. Let’s take a step back to understand exactly how bonkers that is. Rodgers is on his way to winning back-to-back MVPs. He’s playing the best all-around football of his career, balancing his tap-dancing style with Matt LaFleur’s carefully choreographed system. And yet, there’s a chance that he may not play the sport next season. And there’s an even stronger chance that if he does play, it will not be in Green Bay. And this is because the Packers front office drafted Jordan Love in 2020 without consulting their Hall of Famer and refused to allow further roster input (this despite the Packers front office putting together an excellent roster and coaching staff around Rodgers). It has a whiff of Yoko sitting on the amp about it.
The Broncos have the kind of supporting cast that could convince Rodgers to ditch the Packers, particularly if Green Bay fall short in the playoffs again. Plus, the Broncos are likely to have a head coach opening, which would allow Rodgers to handpick his own man in Colorado. Denver also have the assets to further upgrade their roster. They hold five picks in the first three rounds and have bundles of cap room. Could Denver swing a double deal to pinch Davante Adams, the game’s top receiver, away from Green Bay, too? It’s plausible. Russell Wilson to the Cleveland Browns The Russell Wilson-Pete Carroll dynamic has reached breaking point. One of them will leave this offseason. Maybe both. There remains a scenario in which the Seahawks pick Wilson over Carroll, only for the quarterback to say he wants out regardless. If Wilson opts to push for a trade, there’s no better fit than the Browns. Cleveland can mimic the style of offense that brought Wilson success early in his career, while releasing enough of the handbrake to allow Russ to – yes – cook. Add to that, the Browns are loaded. Injuries and Covid issues have sapped the roster throughout this season, but there is star-level talent at every single position throughout the roster and they have as much depth as any team in the league, all under contract heading into next season. Russell Wilson 2.0 – he of his last 25 starts – has developed into a similar kind of player to Baker Mayfield: he’s risk-averse and lacks the dynamism of his early years. But he’s also ruthlessly efficient, someone who can run the same style of run-centric offense but can do so at a higher level and with more out-of-structure upside. If it’s all about winning, Wilson to the Browns makes the most sense for both sides. The Rams’ deal to send two first-round draft picks, a third round pick, and Jared Goff to the Lions in exchange for Matthew Stafford will likely send the benchmark for any future quarterback deals with potential MVP candidates. The Browns could look to recoup some value by moving Baker Mayfield elsewhere, or including him in the deal with Seattle to chip some draft picks off the overall price. And speaking of Mayfield … Baker Mayfield to the New Orleans Saints
There exists a world in which the Browns and Mayfield find a compromise. We’ve yet to see a young quarterback play out a lame-duck fifth-year on his rookie-scale deal since the NFL moved to its new contract system. Mayfield could be the first. Injuries comprised Mayfield’s prove-it year, and there’s little to no chance Cleveland opt to give him a long-term extension. Yet if the Browns are able to snag an upgrade, Mayfield will be out. In that scenario, it will be fascinating to see what his market looks like. His impressive 2020 season is fresh enough in the memory that somebody will talk themselves into trading for Mayfield, perhaps with a long-term, affordable contract tied to the deal. The Saints make sense. Sean Payton has squeezed all the juice out of the Saints’ talent-laden roster this season. One of the league’s best rosters has been hamstrung by brutal quarterback play. Mayfield may not be the long-term answer, but he would represent an upgrade over Taysom Hill and Jameis Winston at this stage in their careers. Kirk Cousins to the Carolina Panthers Cousins will account for (avert your eyes) $45m on the Vikings’ books next season. Forty-five! With just one year left on his free-agent deal, there’s little wiggle room for the Vikings to manipulate the cap number, unless, of course, they commit to the kind of long-term deal that would cause two-thirds of Minnesota to faint. This year represented the final ride of the Mike Zimmer-Kirk Cousins axis. With the duo failing to make the playoffs, the Vikings are staring down a hard reset. If Minnesota can trade Cousins early in the offseason, they will reduce his gaudy cap hit to $10m. Enter the Panthers. Carolina owner David Tepper is infamously impatient. Carolina took swings at all of the big available quarterbacks last offseason. They made a move for Stafford before the Rams blew their offer out of the water. They enquired about Wilson before he chose to return to Seattle. They were the front runner on a Watson deal before sexual assault allegations took him off the market. Not to be deterred, Carolina dealt for Sam Darnold. Oops. That was a bust. Now, they’re back on the merry-go-round, ready and willing to spend whatever draft capital it takes to land a high-level starter. Rodgers and Wilson will be at the top of the list. Beyond those two, Cousins seems like the top choice. Cousins playing on a one-year deal to prove if he can be anything more than Kirk Cousins would make sense for all parties. Teddy Bridgewater to the Pittsburgh Steelers It has been a vintage Bridgewater year. Little to get excited about; little to panic about. His lack of playmaking chops means that he can never be the kind of quarterback that elevates a good roster into a great one. Still: teams will be queuing up for Bridgewater’s brand of don’t-get-me-fired ball, most likely one that will also be dipping into the draft for a young quarterback prospect. The Steelers fit the bill. Pittsburgh will be looking for a long-term replacement for Ben Roethlisberger in the draft. But they also have the defense to win now, provided they can find a quarterback who can squeeze something out of the team’s ho-hum offense. The Steelers will aim big. It’s possible that the allure of Mike Tomlin, a settled infrastructure, and a top-tier defense could be enough for Rodgers or Wilson to try to force their way to Pittsburgh. But the AFC North is a blood bath, and the Steelers’ offensive pieces — as presently constructed, pre-free agency and the draft — don’t exactly inspire a burning in the football loins.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/06/quarterback-trades-nfl-football-2022-offseason-russell-wilson-aaron-rodgers;4
57;57;5297;5297;Football transfer rumours: Rúben Neves wanted by Manchester United?;2022-01-06T08:27:07Z;['John Brewin'];['Transfer window', 'Football', 'Sport'];"On Wednesday, the word on the street was that upwards of 11 Manchester United players wanted to leave the club, the reaction of fans being one of “good riddance”. Those reportedly most frustrated by the lack of changes under Ralf Rangnick include Jesse Lingard, Donny van de Beek, Dean Henderson and Eric Bailly. But who might replace them? Rúben Neves, one of the Wolves players to feature in Monday’s win at Old Trafford, has been linked with a move to Manchester for some time, and it may happen this summer. Dan-Axel Zagadou, a Borussia Dortmund defender available on a free this summer, is also a target. Neves appears to the be the priority, as a cure to the aching gap that is United’s midfield. They would really like to have him on board by the end of January.
Aston Villa are ambitious. That much was clear even before Dean Smith was shipped out in favour of Steven Gerrard. This month’s transfer market looks like being the latest demonstration of that ambition. There is a Liverpool theme to Stevie’s latest moves. There will be no dice on an attempt to sign Joe Gomez from his former club but Philippe Coutinho has been the recipient of a personal phone call from his one-time captain at Anfield. Getting Coutinho off the books is one of the first steps in the new Barcelona regime’s attempts to become the old Barcelona. Should he leave then Ferran Torres, signed last week, might actually be allowed to play. Sources close to Coutinho have been telling hacks that a host of Premier League clubs want to sign him. Keeping it Liverpool, the word is that they are prepared to lose the defender Nat Phillips and Divock Origi, the lucky charm super-sub who is out of contract. Origi is wanted by Lazio, and both players can leave in January, despite the club’s Covid crisis and inability to play Thursday’s Carabao Cup semi. Across Merseyside, the future of Lucas Digne remains up in the air. With Everton having bought two full-backs already in January, the Frenchman looks headed for Chelsea as a replacement for Ben Chilwell rather than Newcastle to pair up with Kieran Trippier, the expected new arrival on Tyneside. Instead, Newcastle are looking to Digne’s compatriot and another man on the Barcelona exit list, Samuel Umtiti, a World Cup winner no less.
Aaron Ramsey is another on the unwanted list, with Juventus wanting to get rid of someone on a hefty wage and who doesn’t feature too much in the first team. Where might he end up? Newcastle seems a fair bet right now, with their financial fair play situation quite decent after Mike Ashley barely spent a penny. His wages of £325,000 a week would be prohibitive to many, but maybe not Newcastle. “Ramsey, he returned today after we had given him a few days off to work, to train separately, in England,” said Max Allegri, the Juve coach. “In any case, he’s an outgoing player.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/06/football-transfer-rumours-ruben-neves-wanted-by-manchester-united;3
58;58;5298;5298;Russian paratroopers arrive in Kazakhstan as unrest continues;2022-01-06T08:26:37Z;['Shaun Walker', 'Naubet Bisenov'];['Kazakhstan', 'South and central Asia', 'Russia', 'Protest', 'Europe', 'World news'];"Russian paratroopers have arrived in Kazakhstan as part of a “peacekeeping” mission by a Moscow-led military alliance to help the president regain control of the country, according to Russian news agencies. Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, asked for the intervention from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) – an alliance made up of Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan – late on Wednesday and it was swiftly approved. It comes as violent clashes continue between protesters and the police and army in Kazakhstan. There is little reliable information on the number of casualties, but local news agencies quoted a spokesperson for police in Almaty, the country’s largest city, saying dozens of people were killed during attacks on government buildings. Almaty city authorities said on Thursday that 353 police and security forces personnel had been injured, and 12 killed. On Thursday morning, shots were fired as troops entered Almaty’s main square. Several armoured personnel carriers and dozens of troops moving on foot arrived on Thursday morning, with shots heard as they approached the crowd, Reuters witnesses said.
State television reported on Thursday that the National Bank of Kazakhstan had suspended all financial institutions. The internet in the country is mostly down as well as mobile phone reception. On Wednesday, there had been reports of violent clashes and shooting in Almaty and other cities, as well as unverified videos suggesting casualties among protesters.
On Wednesday night, Tokayev asked the CSTO to help him regain control. Armenia’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, said the alliance would dispatch forces to “stabilise” the central Asian country.
It is not clear how many troops the CSTO will send or how long they will stay in the country. Russian MP Leonid Kalashnikov told Interfax the troops would stay “for as long as the president of Kazakhstan believes it necessary”. He said they would mainly be engaged in protecting “infrastructure” in the country. Tokayev had appealed to the bloc for help, decrying the actions of “terrorists” and alleging the country had been the victim of “attacks” by foreign-trained gangs after fuel price rises triggered widespread protests. On Wednesday, demonstrators took over government buildings and reportedly stormed the airport in Almaty, the country’s commercial capital. “Almaty was attacked, destroyed, vandalised, the residents of Almaty became victims of attacks by terrorists, bandits, therefore it is our duty … to take all possible actions to protect our state,” said Tokayev, in his second televised address in a matter of hours.
The Kazakh events come at a time when all eyes have been on a possible Russian intervention in Ukraine. Images of police being overpowered by protesters are likely to cause alarm in Moscow, as another country neighbouring Russia succumbs to political unrest. Kazakhstan is part of an economic union with Russia and the two countries share a long border. The protests began in the west of the country at the weekend, after a sharp rise in fuel prices, but have spread quickly and taken Kazakhstan’s authorities and international observers by surprise. The protests have swelled amid broader discontent with Tokayev, president since 2019, and Nursultan Nazarbayev, the former leader. “Nazarbayev and his family have monopolised all sectors, from banking to roads to gas. These protests are about corruption,” said 55-year-old Zauresh Shekenova, who has been protesting in Zhanaozen since Sunday.
“It all started with the increase in gas prices but the real cause of the protests is poor living conditions of people, high prices, joblessness, corruption.” Darkhan Sharipov, an activist from the civil society movement Wake Up, Kazakhstan, said: “People are sick of corruption and nepotism, and the authorities don’t listen to people … We want President Tokayev to carry out real political reforms, or to go away and hold fair elections.” The five former Soviet Central Asian republics have been largely without protest in their three decades of independence, with the exception of Kyrgyzstan, which has had several revolutions. Kazakhstan has never held an election judged as free and fair by international observers. While it is clear there is widespread discontent, the cleansing of the political playing field over many years means there are no high-profile opposition figures around which a protest movement could unite, and the protests appear largely directionless.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/shots-heard-in-kazakhstan-as-protests-enter-third-day;1
59;59;5299;5299;Starmer the lawyer is back – and this time Johnson has nowhere to run | Zoe Williams;2022-01-06T08:00:03Z;['Zoe Williams'];['Keir Starmer', 'Labour', 'Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"“Security. Prosperity. Respect.” Keir Starmer appeared in Birmingham on Tuesday to lay out his offer to the country. It is always, if you care about the Labour party, nerve-racking to hear its leader make an account of its core values, though nothing will ever match the dispiriting moment before the 2015 leadership election, when it named one of its core values as “having strong values”. Shelving, very briefly, the question of who is and who isn’t centrist enough for the country, values are like an octave, or a deck of cards: they are fixed in number, at least the acceptable ones; they are always the same. “Another C sharp, another jack of diamonds,” you think. “Big wow.” It’s only once you’re in the middle of a game that any of them become precious or meaningful, and for far too long the Conservatives have been writing the rules. “Labour values” such as equality were effortlessly lifted, to become “levelling up”. The progressive party flailed to adapt – what next, are we all leveller uppers now? Do we level down? – not realising that the rules were always changing, and now jokers were wild in play too. The way to win against the Conservatives was not to find better, different, newer, or more traditional, or more decisive, or more interpretable values. It was to divest the Conservatives of the legitimacy of their rulebook.
So Starmer’s offer in this speech was more of a placeholder: he vowed that “if we work hard, we should have a right to job security”. I would have preferred a more radical promise, that if we work hard, we should be relatively confident that we can feed and house ourselves, then a side order of support if by circumstance we can’t work hard. He asserted, too, that “everybody has a right to be valued for who we are and what we do”. It’s a laudable idea but quite hard to measure. Yet if you connect those two thoughts – we have workplace rights, and we all have value – it represents a significant break with the last 12 years of economic reality and political discourse. The transfer of power from the worker to the employer that, with zero-hours contracts and poverty wages, has seemed inexorable, would not survive this meaningful reassertion of workplace rights. And the many cruelties of austerity have only endured this long thanks to the underpinning narrative that hardship was self-inflicted and that some (millions of) people simply had less value than others. This is an optimistic interpretation of the speech; the counterpoint, that it simply didn’t say enough about Labour’s policy intentions, is also fair. Its driving purpose was to establish the party as the dynamic vessel of, rather than a moaning participant in, anti-Conservative feeling. Boris Johnson’s critique of his opposite number has, of course, always been that he’s a lawyer – combining the insults boring, technical, elitist, an observer rather than an actor, “Captain Hindsight”. Starmer’s speech, perhaps for the first time since he became leader, performed a jujitsu move: yes he is a lawyer, and Johnson could have at it. He conveyed this explicitly, his patriotism mediated through his hinterland as the “country’s leading prosecutor”. He also did so implicitly, framing his relationship with voters as a “contract” – about as lawyerly as it comes. And he laid a very simple, yet nevertheless lawyerly trap for Johnson: the prime minister himself is unfit for office, yet the problem is with the entire party, not just one man. The Conservatives care so little about the country that they’re “gearing up for a leadership fight” precisely when we most need stability. It was a systematic, rather obvious, block of each exit: they can’t keep Johnson because he’s bent; another candidate won’t stop the rot, because the party is spent; if they ignore the problem and forge on with their leader, it will merely be a depressing illustration that “they’ve been in power too long”; if they try to replace him, they indicate their lack of seriousness and civic duty. These points lay out a foundational principle, without which Labour will always be on the back foot: the Conservative rulebook is no longer legitimate. Later the same day, Johnson gave a press conference of his own, in a move that cynics, which is now all of us, read as attempting to draw attention away from Starmer’s speech. Problematically for Johnson, that press conference was drivel: repetitive, chaotic, and largely devoid of substance. Any that there was, was immediately contradicted by the look on the face of the man (Chris Whitty) standing right next to him. Johnson is getting to a place where, every time he opens his mouth, he makes his opponent’s point for him. Lawyers, huh?

60;60;5300;5300;How Steven Bartlett went from dropout to youngest ever Dragons’ Den investor;2022-01-06T08:00:03Z;['Nadia Khomami'];"[""Dragons' Den"", 'Small business', 'Entrepreneurs', 'Business', 'Television', 'UK news']";"It’s been 10 years since Steven Bartlett unsuccessfully applied to be a contestant on Dragons’ Den. Since then a lot has changed. The school dropout, who once stole food from corner shops and foraged for loose change to keep his hunger at bay, went on to start his own company from his bedroom and was a millionaire by age 23. Bartlett will be the youngest ever investor – or “Dragon” – on the BBC’s hit series when it returns on Thursday. But pay attention and you’ll see him everywhere – whether it’s debates on daytime television, motivational quotes on Instagram or on his podcast, the Diary of a CEO, which has consistently topped business charts for the past year. Joining the show is a privilege and a responsibility for Bartlett, who hopes young people from less privileged backgrounds like his, especially minorities who don’t always see themselves reflected in certain programmes or industries, will feel enabled. “Dragons’ Den was the only window I had into business from 12 years old,” he said. “It’s like the first time you go to New York City after seeing it in films for your entire life. But I understand what I bring. A new perspective from a new era of business. “I feel a responsibility because there’s never been a black, young Dragon on the show. The most powerful role models, of course, are those that are most relatable.” Bartlett was born in Botswana to a Nigerian mum and a British dad. His mum left school aged seven and can’t read or write, his dad was a structural engineer and “very, very smart”. The family (he is the youngest of four siblings) moved to Plymouth, Devon, where they “struggled financially in a nice, white, middle-class area”, something he expands upon in his bestselling book, Happy Sexy Millionaire. That feeling of otherness, of not having “the nice things other people had”, drove him. “I learned that if I was to have anything, it wasn’t going to be left for me under the Christmas tree, it was going to be a direct consequence of my own actions.” He was an insecure boy who struggled in school, barely scraping through GCSEs and A-levels. His attention, he says, was focused elsewhere – from organising school trips to brokering deals with vending machine companies and taking a cut. It was clear from a young age that his interest and talents lay in the world of entrepreneurship. So it wasn’t entirely surprising that he dropped out of his course in business management at Manchester Metropolitan University after just one lecture. He says he looked around the room, full of hungover students and a lecturer handing out felt-tip pens, and “realised this wasn’t going to take me to where I needed to go”. He has vociferous opinions of the education system, which he calls a “propped up scam” held together by a number of stakeholders, none of which are incentivised to help young people nurture their talents and work towards what they’re good at.
“You’ve got the employment world that requires a 2:2 for jobs. You’ve got the university who are getting paid to drag you in and keep costs low, and then you’ve got the schools, which are ranked by grades. It’s an archaic system that hasn’t moved with the modern world fast enough. Information is almost redundant by the time universities publish their textbooks. There’s probably not that many that have been written about blockchain, but we know it’s a pivotal part of our future.” Bartlett’s first proper registered business at 18 years old – a marketing agency called Social Chain – now valued at $600m. He talks much of the importance of following your internal voice and knowing your purpose, a thread that runs through the work of contemporary self-help gurus, including his most recent podcast guest, Jordan Peterson. “I’m really bad at doing things I don’t want to do. If you’re fortunate and take the right steps, that culminates in a life where you’re doing a lot of things you do want to do.” This explains why he left Social Chain in 2020 to pursue new projects, including Thirdweb, a company that creates blockchain-based applications, and Flight Story, a marketing platform. In the latter part of last year, he was also listed as number six in the UK’s black power list alongside Marcus Rashford and Michaela Coel. “Quitting has been demonised in our society. It’s associated with being weak. But it’s the incredibly important thing you have to do before you start the next thing.” His key advice for creating a successful business is being unromantic about your hypothesis. After all, Jeff Bezos originally looked to create an online bookstore. This, and other lessons about business life, were imparted through interviewing other entrepreneurs and business leaders. Though he imagined they’d be incredibly unique, he says he discovered that most of his guests are actually very similar. “They’re all affected by the same anxieties. One thing that happened to them on the playground might steer the course of their life. Sometimes your curses become your blessings and vice versa. Most of the time, having a really shitty childhood is the reason why my guests end up being really remarkable people in their later life.”";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/06/how-steven-bartlett-went-from-dropout-to-youngest-ever-dragons-den-investor;2
61;61;5301;5301;The Expectation Effect by David Robson review – mind-changing science;2022-01-06T07:30:02Z;['Oliver Burkeman'];"['Science and nature books', 'Society books', 'Culture', 'Books', 'Health', 'Society', ""Alzheimer's""]";"When dozens of apparently healthy young men who had emigrated from Laos started dying in their sleep in the late 1970s, US medical authorities couldn’t fathom what was going on. They termed the phenomenon “sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome”, but that was just a label for their bafflement. Today, we think we know the cause: the men experienced sleep paralysis, which is common and harmless in itself; but they understood it as a visitation from the dab tsog, a malevolent spirit who sits on victims’ chests at night. Living far from the shamans and family members who might have helped them ward off the evil, the men panicked, probably exacerbating a form of heart arrhythmia more prevalent in people from south-east Asia, and triggering cardiac arrest. The science writer David Robson’s mission in The Expectation Effect is to convince us we shouldn’t look on those men with condescending pity: our own expectations and beliefs, however irrational, influence our health, happiness and our survival no less decisively. Take, for example, ageing: if you think it’s a matter of inevitable cognitive decline and becoming useless to society, you’re more likely to experience hearing loss, frailty, even Alzheimer’s. Such attitudes predict higher levels of stress and inflammation, which in turn contribute to a range of disorders. (By contrast, in places such as Sardinia, where centenarians are numerous and thriving, their role in intergenerational households is thought to be a factor: it encourages them to expect to stay active.) If you convince yourself that you’re prone to insomnia, you’ll suffer the symptoms of insomnia – even if the truth is that you sleep fairly well. And it’s common for participants in medical trials to experience not only the placebo effect but the “nocebo effect” – drug side-effects such as nausea, dizziness or rashes, even though they’re only taking sugar pills. To an extent, the “expectation effect” is the stuff of self-help cliche: “Whether you think you can or think you can’t, you’re right,” Henry Ford is supposed to have said, rather irritatingly. But one of Robson’s many strengths as a chronicler of science is to take what might seem familiar and show – to his own evident excitement, as well – just how much deeper the rabbit hole goes. You knew about the placebo effect. But did you know it often works, a little mind-bendingly, even when the patient knows they’re taking a placebo? (This is promising, in terms of medical ethics, because it suggests that people need not be deceived in order to benefit.) And if you knew that, did you know there’s evidence that the placebo effect is growing more powerful over time, as more people learn of the placebo effect, and thus expect to experience it? That’s right: the placebo effect has a placebo effect. Expect your expectations to change your life, and they will. While the book abounds in compelling anecdotes – the cyclist who thought he was injecting performance-enhancing drugs, and performed better accordingly; the Portuguese TV show that caused an outbreak of breathing difficulties in its viewers – Robson’s central point is that the expectation effect isn’t an amusing psychological quirk, but a fundamental aspect of our interactions with reality.
Our brains are “prediction machines”, steering us through life by generating expectations, and only revising them when unavoidable. Those expectations then play a vital role in shaping what we experience. This explains why far more people, especially children, see a rabbit in the famous “duck-rabbit” optical illusion around Easter than at other times of year. But it also helps explain why pupils from low-income backgrounds tend to live down to their teachers’ academic expectations – and why some of those teachers tend to react with discomfort, not pride, should they defy their assumptions instead. “Like a dramatist carefully crafting a narrative arc,” Robson writes, “we don’t like the objects of our expectations to go off script.” Robson is aware of the objection that this might all sound like a paean to positive thinking. He rejects that claim: the expectation effect concerns specific outcomes, not a general effort to feel good. Moreover, the cult of positivity reinforces the idea that merely experiencing negative emotions constitutes a crisis, or a personal failing, leading only to more negative emotions: “By demonising unpleasant but inevitable feelings, we have been creating a potent nocebo out of modern life.” In any case, wisely harnessing the power of expectation isn’t a matter of eliminating bad things so much as reframing them – for example, by understanding the feelings of exertion during exercise as evidence that you’re making yourself fitter. (Likewise, I think “writer’s block” is often best thought of simply as what it feels like to push yourself creatively.) That way, apart from anything else, you’re far less likely to quit when the going gets tough. Startling research even shows that when people are encouraged to think of the physical movements in which they already engage for their jobs as exercise, they reap greater health benefits. The result of marinating for a while in this outlook is surprisingly transformative. We’re accustomed to thinking of the external world as an implacable thing that either lives up to, or more commonly frustrates, our expectations. That’s why I’ve always been fond of “defensive pessimism”: keep your expectations low, and you can only ever be pleasantly surprised. But this approach defines our expectations as wholly impotent: vain hopes that reality might or might not deign to fulfil. The Expectation Effect shows that, on the contrary, our expectations participate actively in that reality. Clearly, believing that you could be a champion salsa dancer in your 80s – to pick one of Robson’s examples – doesn’t guarantee that you will be. But it might prove easily as important as the genes you were born with. We defensive pessimists could do with remembering that sometimes things do actually turn out really well – especially if you expect them to. • The Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Transform Your Life by David Robson is published by Canongate (£18.99).

62;62;5302;5302;‘I was there’: Democrat recalls horror and fury on day of Capitol attack;2022-01-06T07:00:06Z;['David Smith'];['US Capitol attack', 'US news', 'US politics'];"It was a visceral cry at the moment of maximum peril for American democracy. A furious mob had overrun police and was nearly at the door of the House of Representatives. Inside the chamber, Republican Paul Gosar was launching a spurious challenge to Joe Biden’s election victory in Arizona. Then, at the back of the gallery on the second floor, Democrat Dean Phillips rose to his feet and screamed at the top of his lungs at Gosar: “This is because of you!” The outburst was out of character for a “Minnesota nice” congressman with a reputation for moderation and working across the aisle. But a year later, Phillips remains convinced it was an urgent and necessary response to the deadly insurrection inspired by then president Donald Trump. “It’s not my style to break decorum and to scream,” he told the Guardian, “but I have to say at that moment I felt the way that tens of millions of Americans did, which is there were people responsible for what was about to transpire and there are moments where you do what you got to do, and I had to do it. I don’t regret it one bit because it’s true.” Phillips, 52, comes from a business background. He led a family-owned distillery – producing vodka, gin, rum and other liquors – and ice cream company. He was elected to Congress in 2018, representing Minnesota’s third congressional district, and is vice chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. “I never imagined I’d be doing this,” he admits. “I woke up the morning after the 2016 election, saw the reaction of my daughters, who were 18 and 16 at that time – their fear, their tears – and I promised them right then and there I would do something, and here I am.”
On 6 January 2021, he had been advised that there could be trouble so told his staff to stay home. He watched his office TV “horrified” as Trump gave a speech urging supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his defeat. He then walked to the House to begin certifying Biden’s election victory. But soon he received text messages from anxious family members showing video of protests forming outside. “I asked my colleague, Tom Malinowski from New Jersey, to walk from the House chamber with me to look out the windows and a Capitol police officer literally screamed at us to get away from the windows and get back into the House chamber. We asked if everything was OK, and – I’ll never forget it – she said, ‘You’re in the United States Capitol. It’s the most secure building in the country’.” They returned to the House chamber just as Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer were being evacuated. Gosar was at the microphone, leading efforts to subvert his state’s electoral college vote, when the sergeant-at-arms urged members to take cover behind seats and prepare their smoke hoods – prompting Phillips to feel “fury” and let rip at the Trump loyalist. While members on the House floor were able to escape, there was no way out for 20 sitting up in the gallery due to coronavirus safety measures. “I screamed at my colleagues at that moment to follow me to the Republican side of the chamber because I thought it would be safer,” Phillips says. “I thought the insurrectionists were coming for us. “First, it was almost impossible to get through these railings; you either had to go under or over. But more than that, I recognized at that very moment that a lot of my colleagues couldn’t blend in. I’m talking about those of color. It really left an indelible mark on me. “That whole day changed me, of course, as it would anybody, to recognise that privilege and the fragility of democracy and also a significant increase in my empathy for those who have endured trauma in their lives, which is life-changing.”
Rioters reached the doors of the House chamber but found their way blocked by an improvised barricade and Capitol police with guns drawn. After an ordeal lasting about 25 minutes, Phillips recalls, members in the gallery were led out by a Capitol police officer and through a maze of tunnels. “We ran into the Rayburn lunch room and it was a bizarre moment because there were people just having lunch at the tables. The sun was shining in from the big plate glass windows and here we are, an officer with a rifle running with us into the lunch room and people just stunned, looking at us like, what the heck’s going on? Of course, the TVs moments later would sure change that.” The group was then moved on to a committee room where they were finally safe. But their shared ordeal would stay with them. They now call themselves “the gallery group” and still meet regularly, sometimes with facilitators or therapists. “It’s been the most wonderful support group imaginable because we endured it together,” Phillips says. On the night of 6 January, with the Capitol finally secured, they and other members returned to the House and Senate to finish the job and ratify Biden as president. For a fleeting moment, it seemed that Democrats and Republicans were united in completing the work of democracy and jettisoning the authoritarianism of Trump. But it was not to last. In the year since the insurrection, some Republicans have embraced Trump’s “big lie” and his portrayal of the mob as patriots driven by a noble cause; others have simply remained tight-lipped and failed to denounce it. Phillips, who sees them up close during sessions of Congress, believes they are motivated by self-preservation of both position and personal safety.
“That’s perhaps the saddest part of all this. Many of my colleagues – especially those who voted to impeach, those who voted to impanel the January 6 commission, those who voted to certify the election – have received horrifying threats to their safety and the safety of their loved ones. It’s an unenviable position but it’s also our responsibility and duty. I understand self-preservation but I do wish principle would take precedence,” he says. It has been difficult for Phillips to witness 6 January denialism as Republicans and rightwing media attempt to rewrite the history of what happened that day, variously characterising it as a “normal tourist visit” or an FBI “false flag” operation designed to entrap Trump supporters. The former president himself insisted that his followers were “hugging and kissing” police. The Democrat says: “This is one of those rare occasions where I was there. I was inside. I heard the gunshot. I saw the remnants of the insurrection in the rotunda and went with [Congressman] Andy Kim at midnight that night to help clean it up when I saw him on his hands and knees alone.” “I saw the body armour. I saw the clubs. I saw faeces. I saw the speaker’s office ransacked. I saw with my own eyes people on the ground under arrest. I saw the mob breaking in. I met with the officers who were subject to it since. I was there to bear witness to it and to hear people say it didn’t happen or it wasn’t a big deal or it’s time to move on, shame on them.” Republicans’ denial of reality, and continued addiction to Trump, has raised fears that 6 January was the beginning, not the end, of American democracy’s near death experience. The party is imposing sweeping voter restrictions across the country and seeking to put “big lie” believers in charge of future elections. Trump could mount another bid for the White House in 2024 with many checks and balances no longer in place. Phillips comments: “We are at the precipice of a very slippery slope and it’s a long way up the mountain when you’re building a democracy but it’s a fast ride down when it slips away. We collectively have to make a choice and a decision here, starting with the simple fact that this is not something that one side or the other can win.”
“If one side upends democracy and destroys its institutions and disrespects the rule of law, chaos will result, violence will result and everything that those propagating this claim is important to them – a strong, stable, secure, prosperous country – will have been lost. That’s why I try to be a voice of reason and a bridge builder, not a destroyer.” A self-described eternal optimist, Phillips believes there is still a cohort in the Republican party that can find a way back to the mainstream. He describes Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, Trump critics serving on the House select committee investigating 6 January, as “heroic”. “I know there are more that share that sentiment that simply are not as public. I have confidence that we will see some type of restoration of principle, assuming American voters find that important.” The congressman’s efforts to lower the political temperature include a series of “common ground” get-togethers in his home district that encourage mutual understanding between constituents across the ideological spectrum. He says: “They’ve inspired me and made me more optimistic because I’ve discovered when, with some intention, you bring people together with disparate political perspectives and break bread, get to know each other and share life stories, common ground is readily available and easily discoverable.” But in this age of polarisation and negative partisanship, there must be some awkward conversations? “We had an experience just a few weeks ago in which someone pulled up in what would be considered a vehicle that a Donald Trump supporter might be driving and someone who was on the far left of that person – in a very uncomfortable moment but it turned out to be a very productive one – acknowledged what she felt when she saw that vehicle pull into the parking lot and what she expected of the person who drove it. “It took courage to share that. It took courage for the driver of the vehicle to listen to it. At the end of the evening, for both of them to recognise their shared humanity and shared interest in a safe and secure country, was a moment of great reassurance but one that can only occur if people stop stereotyping and actually start breaking bread together.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/capitol-attack-democrat-dean-phillips-recalls-horror-fury;1

64;64;5304;5304;Walk like a Minoan: hiking and foraging in eastern Crete;2022-01-06T07:00:05Z;['N/A'];['Crete holidays', 'Greece holidays', 'Europe holidays', 'Walking holidays', 'Walking', 'Life and style', 'Adventure travel', 'Travel'];"Like swirling paper scraps from a bonfire, the charcoal-winged vultures circled high overhead. When I imitated a lamb’s bleat they circled closer, stretching their massive wings and craning long wrinkled necks. The bone-white rocks of the Gorge of the Dead was a fitting backdrop for these pterodactyl-like birds – I could have been in a scene from Jurassic Park. Named not for the hikers that have perished here (happily none has) but because it’s littered with caves where the Minoans once buried their dead, this seven-mile canyon – also called the Zakros gorge – is the end of the Cretan section of the ultra-long-distance E4 hiking route. The whole trail runs for more than 10,000km from Tarifa in Spain to Cyprus, but this island’s stretch starts 320km away in the north-western town of Kastelli-Kissamos and ends at the remote resort of Kato Zakros.
My plan was to hike a bite-size 35km stretch of the E4 in reverse, from Kato Zakros, near the start of the gorge, to Vóri, a hamlet further south where I would catch a bus back to the port town of Sitia. Far from the doom and gloom of TV and social media and the stress of living in a Covid-stricken world, I would heal my soul – for a weekend, at least – by hiking through untamed landscapes and foragiing for food in one of the wildest corners of Crete. Packing my old rucksack with fruit, drinking water and a bag of crumbly feta cheese, I set out in early December. Just over 300 nautical miles from Libya and on roughly the same latitude as Cyprus, eastern Crete is almost as warm as Andalucía in winter. In summer and autumn, soaring temperatures can make hiking sticky and unpleasant, but winter means temperatures around 20C, and the sun shining gently in a sky the colour of stone-washed denim.
Leaving the vultures behind, I was soon deep inside the gorge, hiking on a slippery, shale-strewn path between skyscraper-high cliffs. Apart from the drone of bees in the late-flowering thyme and the fierce whistle of a golden eagle somewhere on high, the silence was absolute. The caves where the Minoans once worshipped the souls of their ancestors – and where in later years defiant locals hid from the successive wrath of Venetians, Turks and Nazis – stared down at me like the blankly watchful faces of ancient Greek masks.
After two hours of hard hiking I collapsed on a rock near the top of the gorge and took in the view. Far below, the once-magnificent Minoan Palace of Zakros, with its remains of marble-pillared halls, shrines and ceremonial pools, shimmered like a mirage above the horseshoe-shaped bay of Zakros. It was from the bay that the Minoans once sailed – boats weighed down with jars of wine, olives and figs – to trade for gold and ivory with Egypt and Syria. It was easy to picture the square-sailed ships setting out from this lonely spot; with little or no tourism and only a handful of inhabitants, Kato Zakros still has a sense of antiquity. Scrambling up one final, staircase-steep section of gorge I emerged near pano (upper) Zakros: a handful of tavernas and a cluster of square white houses in the Unesco-classified Sitia Geopark. At Hotel Zakros I lunched on fried snails (xochloi bourbouristi) in vinegar, rice-stuffed courgette flowers (kolokithanthi gemisti) and other delicious meze.
Leaving Zakros I followed a winding road – past an old mill and the springs that once fed it – and into a sheltered valley where I found an abandoned citrus grove and filled my pockets with tiny sweet tangerines and waxy-skinned lemons. A buffeting wind that tugged at my pack pushed me up along a track lined with purple heather and out on to the plateau of Mavros Kambos – the Black Plain – named for a bloody skirmish with Ottoman troops in the 16th century. Black was a misnomer, however: the fertile plain was viridescent with horta, the wild greens that have been a staple of the Cretan diet since Minoan times. I gathered some of my favourites – galatsida (common brighteyes), radiki (dandelion) and agriozohos (golden fleece) – for dinner. By 6pm when I reached Skalia (abandoned in the 18th century after its inhabitants were massacred by the Turks) the sun was low on the horizon, casting an eerie scarlet light on the old stone houses with their caved-in walls and roofs. Finding a sheltered spot I boiled the horta on my camping stove, drained off the water, added lemon juice and olive oil and ate it with a chunk of feta, enjoying the contrast of salty pungent sheep’s cheese with the tender greens. It was dark by now – so dark that, apart from the distant glow of a village far below, there was no light at all and stars filled the entire sky. It was breathtaking – like being inside a geodesic dome pasted with millions of glittering snowflakes.
Filled with renewed energy after my vitamin-packed foraged dinner I set off along a flinty path fringed with purple heather to Ziros, where I spent the night at Arismari apartments, a sparkling modern complex in the centre of the village. With its small square houses – and backdrop of jagged blue mountain, this tiny village 30km from the nearest town seemed incredibly isolated when I woke to bright sunshine the following day. Nikos, who owns the cafe where I breakfasted on toast and local thyme honey, told me that recent DNA tests by a Florida university proved that most of the inhabitants in this Lasithi region are descended directly from the Minoans.
A dirt track – via vineyards that produce the crisp and spicy Assyrtiko wines – led through the tiny mountain village of Armeni and then down along a winding road to Vóri. A fug of wine and woodsmoke told me I was approaching a casani, the copper still where – in winter – Cretans distil grape skins left from winemaking to produce raki. Manolis, the shepherd who owned the still, handed me a plastic beaker of what looked like spring water. I took a sip and nearly choked on the burning 70% proof alcohol. Manolis told me he’d lived in Lasithi all his life. I mentioned what I’d heard about the DNA tests. “Eh!” he shrugged and took a deep slug from his beaker. “The Minoans loved dancing, women and raki – of course they were our ancestors!”
I hiked on to the outskirts of Vóri where – with Manolis’s permission – I rolled out my sleeping bag in his olive grove. As I lay back to admire the blazing sky full of stars my head was spinning. It was mostly the raki, but I was also giddy with the joy of escaping – for those 35km – the world of Covid. Yamas! Kato Zakros is an hour’s drive from Sitia.

65;65;5305;5305;England’s farmers to be paid to rewild land;2022-01-06T07:00:05Z;['Fiona Harvey'];['Farming', 'Rewilding', 'Wildlife', 'Conservation', 'Environment', 'George Eustice', 'UK news', 'Endangered habitats', 'Endangered species', 'Animals', 'Brexit', 'RSPB', 'The National Trust', 'Trees and forests', 'Soil', 'Pesticides', 'Climate crisis', 'Rural affairs', 'Politics', 'European Union'];"Farmers in England will be given taxpayers’ cash to rewild their land, under plans for large-scale nature recovery projects announced by the government. These will lead to vast tracts of land being newly managed to conserve species, provide habitats for wildlife and restore health to rivers and streams. Bids are being invited for 10-15 pilot projects, each covering at least 500 hectares and up to 5,000 hectares, to a total of approximately 10,000 hectares in the first two-year phase – about 10 times the size of Richmond Park in London. These pilots could involve full rewilding or other forms of management that focus on species recovery and wildlife habitats. Rare fauna such as sand lizards, water voles and curlews will be targeted, with the aim of improving the status of about half of the most threatened species in England.
The exact funding has not been disclosed, as bids will be compared to determine value for money before a final decision on which should go ahead is made this summer. However, the total amount available for such schemes is expected to reach £700m to £800m a year by 2028. By 2042, the government aims to have up to 300,000 hectares of England covered by such “landscape recovery” projects – an area roughly the size of Lancashire. Ministers also plan to offer English farmers payments for “local nature recovery”. The smaller-scale actions taken on their farms could include planting more trees, restoring peatlands or wetlands and leaving space for wildlife habitats. These payments, which will be revealed later this year, should also reach up to £800m a year by 2028. George Eustice, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, said the aim was for wildlife and nature protection to run alongside food production as a matter of course for most farmers. He is expected to tell farmers at the Oxford Farming Conference on Thursday: “We want to see profitable farm businesses producing nutritious food and underpinning a growing rural economy, where nature is recovering and people have better access to it. Through our new schemes, we are going to work with farmers and land managers to halt the decline in species, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, increase woodland, improve water and air quality and create more space for nature.” As well as the two new schemes – landscape recovery and local nature recovery – farmers will also be able to apply for payments to help them protect their soil and take other basic environmental protection measures, under plans announced last year. Funding for these measures will also reach about £800m a year, as part of the post-Brexit overhaul of the £2.4bn-a-year farming subsidies into a system of “public money for public goods”. This means farmers are paid for making environmental improvements, rather than the amount of land they farm.
Green campaigners were sceptical over whether the new payments would be enough to meet the government’s aim of halting the loss of wild species abundance and managing 30% of land for the good of nature by 2030, as well as ensuring that farmers help to solve the climate crisis rather than add to it. The Wildlife Trusts, RSPB and National Trust charities said detail on how the schemes would work was still lacking. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: “The real test of this agricultural transition is not whether it is a little bit better or moderately better than what came before, but whether it will be enough to deliver on [the government’s targets]. Anything less than that means that this historic opportunity will have been wasted. While we’re hearing the right noises from the government, the devil will be in the detail and the detail is still not published nearly six years after the EU referendum.” The schemes would fail unless more was done to help farmers move away from intensive practices, said Jo Lewis, the policy and strategy director at the Soil Association. This could include the introduction of ambitious targets for reducing pesticide and fertiliser use. “These schemes won’t work in isolation. They risk failure if they are forced to compete with mounting commercial pressures that encourage more intensive farming and cheap food production, for which the environment and our health ultimately pay the price,” she said. Though some are benefiting from high grain prices, many farmers are facing a difficult outlook, with rising input costs, plummeting exports due to Brexit red tape, and potential new competition from prospective importers after post-Brexit trade deals.
Martin Lines, the UK chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said that farmers who already take environmental measures were “left in limbo” before the schemes start in 2024. “Government has been running similar environmental stewardship schemes voluntarily for farmers for 20 or 30 years, yet we still have seen huge declines in wildlife. We need these schemes to be bolder and more ambitious, not just delivering more of the same with minor improvements,” he said. Tenant farmers, who work on about a third of farmed land in the UK, are concerned over how they can access the new schemes. They also fear that their landlords may take advantage of large-scale rewilding to remove their tenancies. George Dunn, of the Tenant Farmers Association, said: “It is alarming that, after at least three years of discussions with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, it has no clear plan for access to these schemes by tenant farmers. [Current payments] are being removed while we have a vague commitment for further work to be undertaken on how tenants, and those who use common land, can access schemes. It does feel like we are pushing water uphill.” Mark Tufnell, the president of the Country Land and Business Association, which represents 28,000 farmers, landowners and rural businesses, said: “The government must also ensure that policy changes look towards domestic food production and security. Britain is already at the forefront of agricultural innovation and animal welfare standards, and we must do more to make certain that our great produce is supported here and abroad. We need to guarantee that profitable agriculture remains a core part of the rural economy and feeds the nation sustainably.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/06/englands-farmers-to-be-paid-to-rewild-land;3
66;66;5306;5306;Why new year resolutions can just cause you more stress | Vishvapani Blomfield;2022-01-06T07:00:04Z;['Vishvapani Blomfield'];['New year', 'Buddhism', 'Mindfulness', 'Meditation', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Mental health'];"The evidence for whether new year resolutions are effective is mixed. Make them Smart – specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely – and they can be a spur to effective action. But vaguer resolutions such as “get fit”, “lose weight” or “stop wasting so much time” often conceal a deeper self-criticism that undermines our intentions. The underlying approach is that we must simply try harder – sometimes at everything at once – and that sets us up to fail. We binge on diets, then binge on food and, finally, binge on guilt. I’ve found that apps that help turn my unfocused intentions into a Smart plan really work. A Couch to 5K programme got me running, and I liked having a clear objective. It feels good to be fitter. You might see a bald bloke running with a waddling gait, but I see goals met and targets smashed – and a 10K in my sights. But there’s a downside to resolutions, even when they’re effective and we achieve them. The focus on results has got me checking my Google Fit stats a little too often, introducing an element of data-driven compulsiveness to the simple activity of exercising my body. It reminds me of the impulse I sometimes feel to check my Facebook likes and Twitter followers. I sense it fits with a wider cultural current: the strain coming from the constant effort to keep up, be productive and get ahead is a source of stress, not its cure. Recognising this, part of me wants to simply ditch my phone and forget the targets. I’m a Buddhist, I’ve taught mindfulness for 15 years, and that part of me wants to be unproductive and turn, as we say on our courses, from doing mode to being mode. My favourite exponent of such non-utilitarian living is John Keats, who advocated “delicious diligent indolence” in a letter written to a friend in 1818: “Let us not,” he writes, “go hurrying about and collecting honey, bee-like buzzing here and there for a knowledge that is to be arrived at, but let us open our leaves like a flower, and be passive and receptive.” Keats’s word “diligent” signals that, by indolence, he doesn’t mean inertia. Maintaining an alert receptivity requires what Buddhism calls practice – a conscious effort to develop it over time, which should be undertaken with “balanced effort” – a middle way between wilful or compulsive striving and self-indulgence. The Buddha’s image of this was of a musical instrument whose strings must be tuned neither too loosely nor too tightly.
Drawing on my experience as a mindfulness teacher, I have some suggestions for middle-way practices that foster the alert receptivity Keats recommends. The first is learning to settle the mind. Meditation is by no means the only way to do this, but it’s popular because it offers simple methods for shifting attention from the flow of thoughts to something calming, like the breath. If you’ve tried it for yourself you’ll know that the thoughts don’t just stop, and you sometimes feel uncomfortable. But settling the mind and stepping into a different kind of awareness is actually a fairly straightforward process. That’s a start, but the value of doing this is the “mental space” that opens up by freeing yourself from mental strain and clutter. So it’s important that we don’t just fill the space up again with more input. Buddhism has always spoken of the need to “guard the gates of the senses” – to manage what we expose our minds to, if we want them to develop. And that takes on fresh importance when, with a few clicks, we can access an effectively unlimited supply of movies, music tracks, websites and just about any other diversion we can imagine. There’s not much point in achieving a goal like getting fit or losing weight if it becomes a new source of stress. What I’m really seeking as I run is a sense of flourishing and vitality, and that can only happen by being fully present and aware in each moment, not just when I reach 10K. A more mindful way of living values simplicity over consumption and allows space between activities. It focuses on doing one thing at a time and doing it fully. We need time to reflect and to be curious. These things can be practices, and perhaps you can frame them as Smart resolutions. But in the end we don’t just need to be smart. We need to be wise.

The government ordered the NRC, along with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), to stop work for three months in July, including operations in the Tigray conflict zone. Both organisations were ordered to stop their humanitarian work in July but while MSF’s suspension was lifted in October, the NRC’s was extended. “It is heart-breaking that we were unable to reach our target of serving more than half a million in need across Ethiopia in 2021,” Jan Egeland, NRC secretary general, said in a statement. “Now that we have to restart, it will take time to again reach as many people as we did before the suspension. We have lost many of our staff. We urgently need permits for our international staff to return, and we need to be able to pay our suppliers.” NRC said it was given a “strict warning” from the government over future advocacy on humanitarian needs.
NRC had been providing food, clean water, shelter, education and legal help to 25,000 people when it was ordered to suspend its operations. At the time, the UN called the bans “dangerous” and said Ethiopia needed evidence to back up its claims that the aid groups were spreading misinformation. MSF was banned in the Tigray, Gambella, Amhara and Somali regions. Along with spreading misinformation, the organisation was accused of bringing in satellite communication equipment without authorisation and not getting the correct permits for employees. In September the organisation said the suspension had forced it to discharge patients from clinics at short notice, and meant it could not help people affected by the Tigray conflict, refugees from South Sudan and people suffering from neglected tropical diseases. MSF said that while the three-month suspension had been lifted in late October, it had been difficult to restart operations. “Although we are permitted to resume our work, it has not been possible to restart those medical programmes, mainly due to the current security situation and administrative obstacles,” the spokesperson said.

Finders Keepers, a lost treasure locate and recovery service, filed a federal lawsuit against the justice department over its failure to produce documents on the FBI’s search for the legendary gold, which took place nearly four years ago at a remote woodland site in north-western Pennsylvania.
“With its request Plaintiff seeks to confirm the FBI’s recovery of Civil War-era gold buried in the mountains of Pennsylvania, based in significant part on scientific evidence of the gold’s existence that Plaintiff provided the FBI,” the lawsuit said. The FBI has since dragged its feet on the treasure hunters’ Freedom of Information Act request for records, their lawyer said on Wednesday. “There’s been a pattern of behavior by the FBI that’s been very troubling,” said Anne Weismann, who represents Finders Keepers. She questioned whether the agency was “acting in good faith”. A message was sent to the justice department seeking comment on the suit, which asks a judge to order the FBI to immediately turn over the records. Finders Keepers’ owners, the father-son duo of Dennis and Kem Parada, had spent years looking for what, according to the legend, was an 1863 shipment of Union gold that was lost or stolen on its way to the US Mint in Philadelphia, which was supposed to be used to pay the wages of federal troops. The troops carrying the gold went missing, along with the loot, giving rise to generations of speculation about what happened to it, although historians have cast doubt on the claim, pointing to the lack of official records of the shipment. The duo focused on a spot where they say their instruments detected a large metallic mass. After meeting with the treasure hunters in early 2018, the FBI brought in a contractor with more sophisticated instruments. The contractor detected an underground mass that weighed up to nine tons and had the density of gold, according to an FBI affidavit unsealed last year. “I have probable cause to believe that a significant cache of gold is secreted in the underground cave,” in Dent’s Run, holding “one or more tons” belonging to the US government, Jacob Archer of the FBI’s art crime team in Philadelphia said. Accounts differ as to the amount of gold in the shipment. Some reports say it was 26 gold bars, others 52. Each would have weighed 23kg, meaning it would be worth up to $50m today. In March 2018, the Paradas accompanied the FBI to the site in Dent’s Run, approximately 135 miles north-east of Pittsburgh, but say they were confined to their car while the FBI excavated. The FBI has long insisted that the March 2018 dig came up empty, but the agency has consistently stymied the Paradases’ efforts to obtain information. Finders Keepers asked the justice department for expedited processing, which can be granted in cases where there is widespread media interest involving questions about the government’s integrity. However, the justice department has denied the request – and, as of last month, has yet to assign the Foia request to a staffer for processing, according to the lawsuit. “From the outset, it seems as if the FBI is doing everything it can to avoid answering the question of whether they actually found gold,” Weismann said.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/civil-war-gold-treasure-hunters-fbi-lawsuit;5
69;69;5309;5309;Falkland Islands war photos to go on show for 40th anniversary;2022-01-06T07:00:03Z;['Caroline Davies'];['Military', 'Exhibitions', 'Falkland Islands', 'UK news', 'Photography', 'British army', 'War reporting'];"Striking images taken during the Falkland Islands conflict will go on display together for the first time in a new Imperial War Museums (IWM) exhibition which aims to highlight the long-term legacy of war. The photographs, by Paul Haley for the British army’s Soldier magazine, will feature alongside other exhibits, including online films, to mark the 40th anniversary of the 10-week undeclared 1982 war, with a focus on new awareness of its impact.
Opening on 2 April – the anniversary of the invasion by Argentina – at IWM museums in London, Salford and online, the exhibition aims to bring a new perspective to a war that claimed the lives of 255 British military, 649 Argentinian troops and three civilian Falkland islanders, said the show’s curator, Dr Hilary Roberts. Haley was a first-hand witness, accompanying the taskforce from setting off on board the QE2, to landing at San Carlos in East Falkland and capturing the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Goose Green and the journey to Port Stanley.
He also photographed the Argentinian Skyhawks flying overhead on their way to bomb the British navy vessels Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram. Some of the images, and accounts from Falkland islanders, will also feature in five short films, made digitally available, which will explore the impact of the war, at the time and subsequently. Roberts, the senior curator of IWM’s cold war team, said research offered a new understanding of the conflict, which even today was “still a lens” through which UK-Argentina relations were assessed. “Today we have a greater understanding of the way in which that small conflict has permanently influenced international events, in terms of political legacies, military legacies and social and cultural consequences,” she said. The outcome shaped both governments in power. The Argentinian military junta fell, with Gen Leopoldo Galtieri forced to resign the following the year, while Margaret Thatcher became one of the longest-serving prime ministers.
“The Falklands factor has been much debated. I won’t say it’s the only reason why, but it was clearly one of the factors,” said Roberts. The conflict led to new research into post-traumatic stress disorder and had a lasting influence on Royal Navy ship design, deployment of vessels and commitment to aircraft carriers and submarines, she added. “I hope it will give people awareness that this wasn’t simply a small colonial war, and it wasn’t simply an aberration. It does continue to affect our lives, and that small wars should not underestimated,” she said. “The conflict is moving, slowly, from contemporary history, which is informed by people still alive to tell the story, into documented and researched history, where we learn more from the archives but we gradually lose those voices which are so important.” Haley’s work will feature alongside that of the war artist Linda Kitson, accounts from the Falkland islanders, and exhibits including an Exocet missile and an Argentinian anti-aircraft gun captured by the Gurkhas.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/falkland-islands-war-photos-40th-anniversary-imperial-war-museum-exhibition;4
70;70;5310;5310;Munich: The Edge of War review – an elegant what-if twist on wartime history;2022-01-06T07:00:02Z;['Peter Bradshaw'];['Film', 'Jeremy Irons', 'Robert Harris', 'Film adaptations', 'Second world war', 'Neville Chamberlain', 'Nazism', 'Culture', 'Drama films', 'Period and historical films', 'Books'];"There’s a great turn from Jeremy Irons as the careworn appeaser Neville Chamberlain in this breezy what-if political thriller, adapted from the page-turner by Robert Harris and directed by Christian Schwochow. It’s set at the notorious 1938 Munich conference, convened by Adolf Hitler to force the cringing western powers into giving him the Czech Sudetenland.
With some generous revisionism, this film makes the case for Chamberlain’s savvy negotiating powers and heroic self-sacrifice: he was apparently buying time for British rearmament and exposing Hitler as a bully at the cost of his own reputation. The movie even includes some eyebrow-raising dialogue on the plane home, after Chamberlain has got Hitler to sign that piece of paper promising peace, in which the prime minister predicts that if the Führer ever broke his promise, he would call down world fury on himself – and even bring the Americans into the resulting war! Could Chamberlain have come within a mile of foreseeing that? Or is the movie’s tongue in its cheek?
George MacKay and Jannis Niewöhner play Hugh Legat and Paul von Hartman, two (fictional) minor functionaries on the British and German sides who happened to be best friends at Oxford in the early 30s. With their German friend Lenya (Liv Lisa Fries), they had a kind of come-to-the-Cabaret intimacy, of a more wholesomely non-sexual sort, before Hugh fell out with Paul over the young German’s Hitler fan-worship and Lenya mysteriously vanished. But fast forward to 1938 and Paul is now secretly anti-Nazi, planning to sneak his old pal Hugh a secret document that will prove Hitler’s plans for conquest and disrupt the deal. If he is caught, he will be sent to the camps – and the British themselves, increasingly committed to appeasement and their own supposed heroism in averting war, would be furious at this desperately dangerous game. Robert Bathurst plays genial British ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson and Alex Jennings is the peppery, stiff-necked diplomat Horace Wilson. In this very male world, perhaps it is telling that the female characters are the fictional ones: Jessica Brown Findlay is Hugh’s unhappy wife Pamela and Sandra Hüller is Helen Winter, the worldly army widow with whom Paul is having a gloomy affair. The Führer is Ulrich Matthes, who played Goebbels in Downfall. Just as Hugh is beguiled by Chamberlain’s twinkly-eyed charm in private over whisky and cigars, so Paul finds himself mesmerised by Hitler’s cobra gaze and the sickly, hideous thrill of Führerkontakt as Hitler, due to some caprice of his own, decides that he will elicit the opinion of this stammering aide. It all rattles along easily enough, with some nice spycraft set pieces. As with Frederick Forsyth’s The Day of the Jackal, the fact that you know what happens in the end is no bar to enjoyment. But the junior members of the cast, who are the stars, look pretty lightweight compared to Irons’s Chamberlain and I wonder if it wouldn’t have been better to adapt Harris’s book as a two- or three-part streaming TV version in which characterisation could have been built up and smoothed out, and Lenya’s fate would have been resolved less perfunctorily. Well, none of this stops it being an ingenious, elegant counterfactual drama. • Munich: The Edge of War is released on 7 January in cinemas and on 21 January on Netflix.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/munich-the-edge-of-war-review-jeremy-irons;5

We missed him, of course, but also, as the only member of our family to have done anything novel over the past year, he seems thrillingly exotic. We badgered him with questions like medieval peasants welcoming a knight returned from the crusades. “You went bowling?” we whisper in wonder. “You sat in a library! With strangers!” But his return has also revealed to me how worryingly far along the road of role reversal we have already gone. His is a sweetly sensible generation and I often feel grossly irresponsible around them. So far, he has told me off for not drinking enough (well, any) water, not taking weight-bearing exercise, and looking forward to The Apprentice (him: “It’s just trashy reality TV”; me: “That’s the point?”). As his father and I experimented with various festive alcohols and artery hardeners, he brewed his own herbal teas from whole spices, ground in the pestle and mortar he requested for Christmas, and bemoaned the lack of a tofu press in our house. Yesterday, he urged me, the person who views any meal that takes more than 15 minutes to prepare as a personal affront, to soak my own pulses. Most evenings he works or reads something improving while we sit gormlessly in front of yet another iteration of MasterChef, picking biscuit crumbs from our cleavage (me) or sleeping (spouse). Last week things came to a head when he distributed copies of a paper he had read on the deleterious effect of “media multitasking” (basically, looking at our phones while watching TV) on memory. It will never stop being delightful to see your child become an adult, but this is dangerous. If I can now relinquish responsibility for behaving like a grownup, where will this end?

72;72;5312;5312;Staff shortages batter Australian economy as Covid surge leaves half of some companies’ employees unable to work ;2022-01-06T06:51:35Z;['Ben Butler'];['Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Business', 'Health', 'Coles', 'Woolworths', 'Australian trade unions'];"Staff shortages caused by Covid are pummelling the Australian economy, emptying supermarket shelves and closing shops and restaurants amid renewed calls for rapid antigen tests to be made free in workplaces. While there is no hard data on how many people are off work because they have Covid, are isolating due to being a close contact or are waiting for a test, some companies are reporting that half of their employees are unable to attend.
Trucking and logistics are particularly hard-hit, as is the meat industry, which this week warned of shortages unless slaughterhouses and boning rooms were either exempted from health orders prohibiting close contacts from working or provided with Covid tests. There are empty spaces on supermarket shelves in every department of the two big supermarkets, Coles and Woolworths, as staff shortages hit every part of the supply chain from suppliers through to transport companies and the chains’ own distribution centres, which send products to individual stores. In a return to measures last seen at the height of the first wave in 2020, Coles has limited sales of mince, sausages, chicken breasts and chicken thighs to one packet per customer in order to stop panic buying. Woolworths has yet to bring in buying limits. Supermarkets are also reducing the range of products they sell in order to make life easier for their suppliers. There are fears within the supermarket industry that some stores may be forced to shut or reduce their hours due to workers being unavailable. While loosened close contact rules have made it easier to keep people at work, this extra capacity has been overwhelmed by the skyrocketing number of Covid cases, which climbed past 68,000 across Australia on Thursday. Scott Morrison said testing requirements for truck drivers had been watered down in a bid to ease the strain on the logistics system while the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has spoken to supermarket bosses about the crisis. The prime minister admitted the rolling staff shortages were taking a toll on the economy and said the federal government was focused on increasing capacity in critical areas including healthcare, distribution centres, food production and transport.
“We need truck drivers to keep on trucking, that is what we need to do to keep moving things around,” Morrison said. “And right now they are delivering vaccines to GPs and pharmacists, and that system is of course under strain because of the high case numbers.” The prime minister has also asked the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, to meet with state governments to discuss loosening laws that require employers to maintain a safe workplace so that small business does not have to bear the cost of buying rapid antigen tests (RATs), the price of which has skyrocketed due to soaring demand and limited supply. A spokesman for Cash said the Morrison government “will work with state and territory governments to provide clarity to employers on rapid antigen testing requirements under WHS [work health and safety] laws”. “The attorney general is reaching out to WHS ministers to progress this work.” Unions strongly opposed the idea, which they doubt is practical, and repeated their call for the government to provide free RATs for small businesses. The acting secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Liam O’Brien, said all workers were entitled to the same level of protection at work as Morrison, who on Wednesday said he was able to get RATs provided to workers at the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet because he was “an employee in this building, like everybody else”. O’Brien attacked Morrison for failing to buy enough RATs despite the warning, given by unions and businesses in October, that they would be needed once restrictions were reduced and face-to-face commerce resumed. “On the one hand he’s entitled to this very safe workplace [but] because he’s failed to do his job in securing enough tests for the nation, the rest of us are expected to work in less safe conditions,” O’Brien said.
“If we’re going to start to remove the obligations on employers to introduce rapid testing, not only are we going to see more workplace outbreaks, which is going to lead to more people getting Covid, but as we’re seeing right now, we’re going to see businesses shutting down.” He said workplace health and safety laws were under the control of the states, not the federal government. “I don’t think it is possible or practical for him [Morrison] to amend eight different pieces of state legislation,” he said.
The union that represents employed chemists, Professional Pharmacists Australia, said a plan announced by Morrison to hand out up to 10 free tests to concession card holders was not good enough. “Such limited access doesn’t help millions of workers and businesses who need access to multiple tests on a regular basis to protect workplace health safety and operational continuity,” the union’s chief executive, Jill McCabe, said. “Access to free tests is a critical health and safety risk-mitigation measure required to reduce the spread of Covid in workplaces.” As Guardian Australia has previously reported, tourism and hospitality operators and airlines have also had to reduce their operations due to staff shortages caused by the surge in cases.
Sarah Hunter, the chief economist for Australia at BIS Oxford Economics, said it was hard to gauge the effect of staff shortages on the economy until workforce statistics were released by the Bureau of Statistics late next month. She said it was also difficult to tell whether the hit was caused by the problems with supply or a slump in demand. “You’re also seeing people being less willing to get out and about, shop, that kind of thing,” she said. “Whether it’s because people aren’t able to go to work or they don’t want to go out, it’s difficult to tell because they’re happening at the same time.” However, Hunter said Australia could learn from the woes experienced by the UK and US in previous waves where those countries did not lock down. She said up to 25% of employees across the third of the Australian workforce that was in industries where working from home was not possible could be put out of action at any one time. “Twenty five per cent is definitely a worst case, I’m not saying that’s going to happen, but clearly for the next few months it’s going to be difficult across the economy,” she said. “It’s not just healthcare industries, it’s companies like Woolworths and Coles and the food supply chain. “In the UK in their last wave they were having problems not because of supply problems but because they weren’t able to get things on the shelves.” Hunter said another pressure point would be parents who were unable to work because their children had to stay home and needed to be supervised. “Again it’s hard to know how much of an impact this will have, but in the US and the UK this factor has been cited in surveys as one of the reasons people haven’t yet returned to the workforce.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/06/staff-shortages-batter-australian-economy-as-covid-surge-leaves-half-of-some-companies-employees-unable-to-work;2
73;73;5314;5314;UK spends a record £9.7bn on home entertainment in 2021;2022-01-06T06:01:00Z;['Mark Sweney'];['Digital media', 'Music industry', 'TV streaming', 'Games', 'Media', 'Business', 'Film industry', 'Television & radio', 'Culture'];"British consumers spent a record figure of almost £10bn on home entertainment last year as the pandemic continued to fuel a boom in streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify. That included a “miracle” increase in revenues from sales of physical music formats after two decades of seemingly inexorable decline, helped by fans starved of live gigs spending their extra cash on vinyl. Overall spending on entertainment, which covers digital and physical video, music and gaming – including sales of CDs, DVDs and video games – increased by 4.6% last year to £9.7bn. The figures, which were inflated by the growth of streaming TV and music subscription services, defied expectations of a decline after entertainment spending in 2020 grew at the fastest rate in a quarter of a century.
James Bond: No Time to Die was the bestselling video content of the year, with Bond fans snapping up three times as many copies as the next most popular entry. The latest edition of football title Fifa once again topped the video games charts, while Adele’s 30 was the most popular album. “The entire sector was braced for revenues to settle down in 2021 after 2020 grew an astonishing 18.7%, but growth has continued for the ninth successive year,” said Kim Bayley, the chief executive of the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA), which publishes the annual report. “The vast majority of the growth is being driven by digital services making entertainment more accessible and convenient than ever before.” The figures highlight the scale of the dramatic shift towards internet-based services, from subscribing to a service such as Netflix or Spotify to buying or renting a game, film or box set from Sky Store or Apple’s iTunes, with almost 90% of total entertainment spend now on digital services.
Total digital revenues grew by 8.3% to £8.66bn, more than the entire market was worth just two years ago. By comparison, overall physical revenues declined 18.5% to just over £1bn. However, the ERA said that within this decline music fans delivered a “miracle”, with sales of physical music showing growth for the first time since 2001. Sales of physical music grew 7.3% to £291.5m thanks to the continuing boom in the popularity of vinyl, which was given an additional boost by fans spending their cash on stocking their music collections because of the lack of gigs and concerts. Revenues from vinyl album sales rose 23% to £135.6m, while CD sales continued to fall 3.9% to £150m. “The return of physical music sales to growth a full two decades since they started to decline is nothing short of a miracle,” said Bayley. However, the music sector remains dominated by digital with income from subscriptions to services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music climbing 11% to £1.3bn. This was more than the entire value of the UK recorded music industry as recently as 2018 and accounted for 80% of the total £1.67bn.
Adele produced the most popular album of the year with total sales of 600,000, ahead of Ed Sheeran’s =, which sold 432,000 copies. In the video market, spending on subscription streaming services, led by Netflix, Amazon’s Prime Video and Disney+, grew by 28% year on year to £3.16bn. Overall, digital revenues accounted for 93% of the total £3.75bn video market, which grew by 13% in 2021. However, a lack of blockbuster releases in cinemas last year dramatically affected income from subsequent DVD sales as well as digital ownership and rentals from services such as Apple’s iTunes and Sky Store. Overall revenues from DVD sales fell 40% to £150m, while Blu-ray Disc income decline by a fifth to £85.7m and digital rental and ownership fell 28% to £336m. Nevertheless, Bondmania fuelled 1.1m sales of No Time To Die, including renting and buying or downloading a copy physically or digitally, more than the rest of the top five bestsellers combined. “The reopening of cinemas and significant backlog of Hollywood blockbusters means we can expect renewed growth in ownership formats this year,” said Bayley.
In gaming, which was the largest sector in the entertainment industry at £4.28bn, revenues fell 3.3% in 2021, having hit an all-time sales record in 2020 having grown by 18%. The ERA said a key factor in the dip was also the global shortage of semiconductors, which had hampered gamers getting their hands on the latest PlayStation and Xbox consoles. The only segment to show growth last year was mobile and tablet gaming, which grew 8% year on year to £1.5bn. Fifa 22, the bestselling game of the year, sold 917,000 physical units and another 1.3m in digital format.";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/06/uk-spends-record-pound-97bn-on-home-entertainment-in-2021;5

It is a so-called “revenge porn” site and in January 2020, a friend had texted her for help. Ruby is a secondary school teacher, used to supporting teenagers, and her friend turned to her for advice when she discovered her images were on the site. “She didn’t send the thread that she was on,” says Ruby, 29. “She was embarrassed, so she sent a general link to the site itself.” When Ruby opened it, “I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I couldn’t believe that such an infrastructure existed: something so well organised, so systematic, fed by the people who lived around us.” AnonIB was categorised by country – the US has the most entries, the UK is next – but then broken down by region, city and local area. “And when I say ‘local’, it wouldn’t be ‘London’ or ‘Birmingham’, a city of any size would have smaller, specific categories, like ‘Birmingham University students’,” says Ruby. The thread for Ruby’s town (population 55,000) stretched to 16 pages and with each intimate image of women and girls, there were comments with as much identifying information as possible by local users – names, surnames, the schools they had attended, who their relatives were. There were also lots of “requests” for pictures of certain women – often called “wins” (“Any wins on XXXX?” “There must be more of this slut out there.” “I can now look her boyfriend in the eye knowing I’ve seen his missus naked.”) Ruby was horrified. “I was in shock. Disgusted that it existed, but also confused,” she says. “How could it be allowed?” But worse was to come. Four months later, she found her own pictures had been added to the site. AnonIB has used various names over the last few years – always some kind of variation of “image board” and “anonymous”. It was shut down by Dutch police, but has since reappeared and is currently hosted from a Russian domain. In the past few months, it has gone behind a paywall.
Yet the site is not a one-off. It is just one example of what a report last month by the Revenge Porn Helpline (RPH) has termed “collector culture” – something the RPH identifies as “an emerging trend”, “increasing at pace”. In this case, collecting means posting, collating and trading intimate images of women. “It’s one of the most dehumanising aspects of intimate image abuse that we see,” says Zara Ward, senior helpline practitioner at RPH. “Women are prizes to be passed around, shared and traded like a dystopian version of Pokémon. We often don’t know how these people gained the images in the first place – it could be exes, friends, or hackers – but this isn’t a place where women would consensually upload themselves. All we see on the comments is women consistently and aggressively objectified, humiliated and exposed.” This happens on multiple platforms: Mega, Dropbox, Discord, anywhere groups can share. On Reddit, anonymous users post images of (likely oblivious) women with captions such as “trading my gf nudes” and “trading gf. Have bj videos too”. Interested parties are then usually directed to personal accounts on Snapchat or the messaging app Kik. Although it is impossible to know how common this is, the evidence suggests it’s widespread. (When Ruby was added to the AnonIB thread in May 2020, she was image number 72,000.) One general study of intimate image abuse across Australia, New Zealand and the UK suggests one in five men have been perpetrators, and during lockdown – when online activity replaced real-life interactions – calls to the RPH doubled. (Its figures show that women are five times more likely than men to have their intimate images shared.) “Traditionally, we think of ‘revenge porn’ as someone posting your images on Pornhub and sending you the link, or sending pictures and videos to all your friends and family to hurt and humiliate you,” says Elena Michael from the campaigning group #NotYourPorn. And, in fact, this is what current law nominally protects against. Section 33 of the 2015 Criminal Justice and Courts Act makes it illegal to disclose “private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress”. Yet, says Michael, that is only one form of such abuse. “The truth is that most intimate image abuse is clandestine. It’s done without consent, but also, often, with no intention of the survivor ever finding out.”
Sophie Compton, who also campaigns against intimate image abuse with the organisation My Image My Choice believes “collector culture” could make up the bulk of cases. “I’ve been talking to survivors for 18 months and it’s huge – maybe more prevalent than any other form,” she says. “I’ve looked at the sites and the forums and the casual misogyny, the vile language, is absolutely chilling. The posters genuinely aren’t seeing victims as human, just stocks and shares to be traded. They could be anyone and everyone – and on sites like AnonIB which categorise by location, it could be the person standing next to you in Sainsbury’s.” Clare McGlynn, professor of law at Durham University, says this is the “hardest message”. “People would rather think perpetrators of intimate image abuse are either perverts or an extremely malicious ‘other’ type of person,” she says. “The truth is that it’s everyday men and boys. Closed groups, lad chats, bonding over explicit images and ‘banter’ has become absolutely ubiquitous.” Sometimes, it leaks out and the wider world gets a glimpse. McGlynn points to the rugby group at Oxford Brookes University that challenged players to get as many “Brookes girl” nudes as possible to share and rate. There is the “men-only” private Bristol Facebook group set up to share images of partners and ex-partners that gained 7,000 members in a matter of days. Professor Nicola Henry, socio-legal scholar at RMIT University Australia, has studied the motives of perpetrators, looking at 77 platforms, image boards, community forums and blogging sites where images are shared and traded, and interviewed perpetrators. “Despite a lot of media attention focused on revenge against an ex-partner as the key motivation, it’s more commonly related to sexual gratification or impressing online peers,” she says. “For instance, on some sites, images of wives and girlfriends are shared to get positive feedback from other users.” (“It might have been a bit of showing off,” said one perpetrator she interviewed. “After I’d built up quite a collection, I started to kind of take this pride in it,” said another.) Whatever the motivation, the impact can be devastating. Ruby learned that her images were on AnonIB when a former schoolmate sent her a message breaking the news. The pictures were taken when she was 17, on a girls’ holiday. In one, she had been sunburned, and was lying topless on her front while a friend rubbed aftersun on her back. In the other, she was demonstrating the size of the hotel towels, not big enough to cover her.
“On the scale of things, they were not that explicit – although in the context of that website, they looked suggestive,” she says. “I’d uploaded them for about three weeks after the holiday in a private Facebook album. I probably had about 400 Facebook friends at the time so whoever posted them was one of those people. I’ve resigned myself to never knowing who.” But as a local teacher, she had to inform her employer; she has no idea if her students have seen the pictures. And in the immediate aftermath, she found herself bolting from a post office queue simply because the teenagers outside suddenly made her feel uncomfortable. She formed a WhatsApp group for other local victims from the thread; in her small town, news travels fast and friends share their stories. “It has been far worse for some of them,” she says. “Their images were often far more explicit. Some haven’t been able to tell family or friends. Some were pregnant and so distressed they had to make emergency visits to hospital. “One girl wanted to pursue a career in the performing arts but she has put it off. She deferred her place at drama school because in that industry, image is everything. She didn’t know if she could cope with the anxiety of being Googled.”
For Helen, 28, it feels as if she is an entirely different person from the one she was before her intimate images were shared in an encrypted chatroom. This spring, she received an anonymous “tipoff” on her Facebook account that explicit pictures of her had been gathered in a Google Drive folder and posted online. The informer – who was later traced to Australia – attached some of the pictures and said they thought she would like to know. She remembers collapsing on to her bed in shock; going for a run, dropping to the ground to cry, running again, then dropping again. The images in the message had been created in the course of a five-year relationship that had ended two years previously. “My ex had assured me they’d all been deleted,” says Helen. “We’d been speaking as friends right up until weeks before this happened. I had no reason to think he’d ever do that.” More than 18 months on, she still struggles. “I’m single,” she says, “and dating is really tough. I used to be open, confident, proud of my sexuality. It has damaged something I loved about myself, made it something I have to fight for again. “I have moments of shame I can’t control, moments when this fear arises that I can’t predict. I’ve had times when flirting with someone suddenly seems to cross a boundary I can’t understand. I’ve largely avoided intimacy as it’s too terrifying to really give that trust to another person.” Helen has tried to find out as little as possible about what was posted and where. “I’ve kind of chosen not to know,” she says. “It could be a lot. I was with that person a long time.” Her ex-partner was interviewed by police and also sent her a message admitting to sharing the images, but adding he had “never meant to hurt her”. He said he did it for his own “kink”. “As painful as it was to have it confirmed, I was happy that at least I had a confession the police could use,” she says. “Then it transpired that his claim of not wanting to hurt me was precisely what protected him from any prosecution.”
Ruby and the other victims in the WhatsApp group from her local town have also found no recourse in law. She reported her case to police who gave her a crime reference number and referred her to Victim Support. Others in her group heard nothing back. In one case, one woman said, the officer actually yawned and said it was the 20th AnonIB report of the day. It took a lot of collective pressure for their cases to be referred as cybercrime to the Regional Organised Crime Unit. There has been no update since. “We really felt the police didn’t support us, but the law doesn’t support the police,” says Ruby. “Yes, there’s the website, the infrastructure: why are we allowing access to it in the UK? “But there’s also the local element. Some of the images on the thread were FaceTime screen shots. The image in the corner of the man on the calls could clearly be seen. We positively IDed at least two of them. We know who they are, where they live and told the police – but they didn’t even knock on their doors. Perpetrators have so many admissible defences. ‘I did it for a laugh and didn’t think she’d see.’ ‘I was paid a tenner to upload pictures of girls in my area.’ Doing it for sexual gratification is an admissible defence. We’re campaigning to remove the motive element from the law. Sharing intimate images without consent is the bottom line and that’s what should be illegal.” There are signs that things will change. The Law Commission review of the laws around intimate image abuse began in 2019; the final report this spring is expected to make nonconsensual sharing an offence. However, warns McGlynn, changing the law is a very slow process – and only part of the solution.
“It also comes back to culture change, education, work in schools,” she says. “Evidence from studies shows that just as teenage girls are pressured to send nudes, teenage boys are also feeling pressure to get nudes and share them, to gain kudos. Collecting digital trophies is becoming part of being a boy and a man – that’s what we need to change.” In the meantime, Ruby is not sure that it’s worth knowing that your images are online, passed between others, traded, shared, collected and commented on by friends and strangers. “It’s really difficult,” she says. “On the thread for our town, there are girls I recognise, who I haven’t spoken to since I was 16. You feel a sense of moral obligation. Do I tell them – even when I know nothing is going to come of reporting it and there’s nothing they can do? Is it better that they don’t know or is it better that they do know and are as distressed as we were? I’ve decided I’m not going to pop up and derail their life. Maybe ignorance is bliss.” Some survivors’ names have been changed.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/i-have-moments-of-shame-i-cant-control-the-lives-ruined-by-explicit-collector-culture;6
76;76;5317;5317;1921 Census of England and Wales reveals nation reeling from war;2022-01-06T06:00:02Z;['Amelia Hill'];['Census', 'Genealogy', 'National Archives', 'UK news', 'First world war', 'Arthur Conan Doyle', 'Books'];"An intimate and unique snapshot of a nation reeling from the aftermath of the first world war was made available to the public on Thursday as the National Archives’ 1921 Census of England and Wales went online. The unprecedented glimpse into life 100 years ago reveals the very personal impact of the economic turmoil, housing crisis and major social changes caused by the war and the Spanish flu pandemic, capturing the desperation, anger and sadness of the 38 million individuals who filled in the form. It also reveals a very British sense of subversion and humour: for the first time, the Census asked the occupation of every member of the household. With her tongue firmly in her cheek, Constance Bernard Fitzhamon of Middlesex, listed her three young children’s occupations as “Getting into mischief”, “Getting into more mischief” and, for her 11-month old child, as “occupying feeding bottles”.
Despite being an official document whose purpose was to collate dry statistics, the Census glitters with emotional gems: John Platt’s son was born in Monmouthshire, Wales, on the very night the Census was filled out: “Baby Boy Platt” was proudly listed by his father as being just two hours old on the form, too young to even have a name. On the same day, also in Monmouthshire, a baby girl born appears to have been named literally as the Census was filled out. Martha Wall initially recorded her newborn baby as “Baby one day old” before crossing it out and adding the name Rose. Census enumerators, local officials who often knew the families, sometimes added extra details to the forms. William Hamilton of Newcastle upon Tyne mysteriously noted that he had a private income. The enumerator added – even more mysteriously – “Never worked. Enjoys Father’s Egyptian Pension”. The British love of animals – or perhaps the national fondness for mild subversion – is evident in the many families who listed family pets among their household members, including “Bobby the Dog” and “Tarzan the Cat”. “The census enumerators rarely had a sense of humour about these entries and struck them out,” said David Olusoga, professor of public history at the University of Manchester. Francis Sutcliffe of Kirkdale, Lancashire, for example, had her entry for “Kitty the Cat” crossed out with the curt explanation that Kitty was merely: “A domestic cat”. Mary McKee, head of content publishing operations at Findmypast, said they had expected humour and gentle sabotage of a document that was, after all, onerous to complete. “But what we hadn’t expected was the bureaucratic graffiti,” she said. “People were angry that they had been promised a postwar ‘land fit for heroes’ by the government but were, instead, experiencing mass unemployment and poor housing.” Many people used the form to protest: “David Lloyd George, build houses”, instructed Henry Burrough in Durham in a large note added to the form. “Lloyd George is hereby requested to bring forth that ‘Land fit for heroes’,” he added. “Nation’s duty to provide houses.” James Eldon Haynes in Yorkshire agreed. “Out of Work in the Land Fit for Heroes,” he wrote. Robert Stevens in Liverpool, who was out of work and had 12 children, wrote: “Please help me. Times are hard.” “It’s fascinating to see how many people subverted the Census and used it as a means of protesting to those in power,” said Olusoga. “This use of the Census reminds me of the way people now use Twitter.” The way the Census had to be filled out unpeeled other intimate details: it had to be completed on 19 June before midnight. On that night, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle, appeared to be holding a seance. “The Census shows he was playing host to a number of mystics and psychics that evening,” said McKee. “A seance seems the logical explanation of that gathering.” Other hidden treasures were discovered during the three years of intensive conservation and digitisation devoted to the Census. A dead menagerie of insects were found within its pages: 532 historic insects from a century ago. “I don’t know what’s been done with them,” said Olusoga. “I like to think a specialist conservationist has whisked them away to start a dead zoo.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/1921-census-of-england-and-wales-reveals-nation-reeling-from-war;3
77;77;5318;5318;Top UK law firm fined record sum for breaching money-laundering rules;2022-01-06T06:00:02Z;['Haroon Siddique', 'Harry Davies'];['Law', 'UK news', 'Regulators', 'Business'];Mishcon de Reya, one of the UK’s most prestigious law firms, has been fined a record amount for committing “serious breaches” of money-laundering rules. The London-based firm has agreed to pay a fine of £232,500, plus a further £50,000 towards the costs of the investigation, which was carried out by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). In its decision, published on Wednesday, the regulator said Mishcon de Reya’s conduct had “potential to cause significant harm by facilitating transactions that gave rise to a risk of facilitating money laundering”. The SRA investigation concerned work the firm carried out for two unnamed individual clients between September 2015 and April 2017, and corporate vehicles connected with the same two individuals. The work included the proposed acquisition of two separate entities that had “higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing” under relevant money-laundering legislation, because they involved companies in high-risk jurisdictions. The regulator found Mishcon de Reya failed to carry out the required level of due diligence or ongoing monitoring. Additionally, between 22 July and 28 July 2016, a payment of £965,000 was made into Mishcon de Reya’s client account and three payments – the highest of $1,099,015, equivalent to £810,000 – were made out of it, none of which related to the delivery of services by the firm, contrary to SRA rules that forbid client accounts being used “as a banking facility”. The firm accepted the SRA’s decision and fine, which is is almost double the previous highest of £124,436, imposed by the regulator on Find My Claims in 2019, for sending six million unsolicited marketing letters to members of the public in respect of mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI). A spokesperson for Mishcon de Reya disputed that the fine was the largest imposed by the SRA because the penalty covered two separate investigations rather than one. The settlement will prevent the investigation looming over the firm as it prepares to float on the London Stock Exchange. The company is expected to seek a value of about £750m, based on typical valuations in the legal sector, a price tag that would make it the largest London-listed law firm, with every member of staff becoming a shareholder. The firm is known for representing the wealthy, famous and powerful. High-profile cases include acting for Diana, Princess of Wales, during her divorce from Prince Charles and for Gina Miller when she took on the government over whether parliament had to approve the triggering of article 50 after the Brexit vote. Keir Starmer advised the firm while in parliament but ended the relationship when he became shadow Brexit secretary in 2016, subsequently turning down the offer of a lucrative second job with the firm. The level of the SRA fine was based on 0.25% of turnover, in the middle of the band of up to 0.5%, because the SRA said “the breaches were serious but the risks did not crystallise into causing harm to clients or the wider public interest”. Based on Mishcon de Reya’s turnover of £155m, that would have been equivalent to £387,500 but it was reduced by the maximum allowable 40% discount to reflect mitigating circumstances. A Mishcon de Reya spokesperson said: “We are pleased to have come to a settlement with the SRA relating to two separate and historic investigations in relation to which we have made appropriate admissions. Mitigating factors such as our cooperation with the SRA throughout the investigations and the corrective action we have taken since to prevent a recurrence have been recognised by the SRA in reaching this outcome.”;https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/06/top-uk-law-firm-fined-record-sum-serious-money-laundering-rule-breaches-mishcon-de-reya;2
78;78;5319;5319;Republicans are laying a path back to power – and paving it with lies | Rebecca Solnit;2022-01-06T06:00:01Z;['Rebecca Solnit'];['US Capitol attack', 'Republicans', 'US news', 'US politics', 'World news', 'Donald Trump'];"When the insurrectionists of 6 January rampaged through the Capitol, congressman Andrew Clyde of Georgia helped barricade a door, and he fled when the rest of Congress did. A photograph shows him looking panicky, mouth wide open and arm gesticulating wildly, behind what appears to be a security team member with a gun drawn, defending him. But a few months later he declared: “Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol and walked through Statuary Hall showed people in an orderly fashion staying between the stanchions and ropes, taking videos, pictures. You know, if you didn’t know the TV footage was a video from 6 January, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit.” Clyde’s account of 6 January might be a little more preposterous than those of his fellow Republican legislators. But they all joined him in pretending nothing much had happened and objecting to the investigation of the day’s events. After all, they were partly responsible, most of them. It was elected Republicans who supported and spread the earlier lies that Donald Trump had won the election, the lies that fed the insurrection; and then they lied some more about their own words and actions before, during and after. In the immediate aftermath, the then Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, was angry and shaken, declaring: “The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president.” Then he too began the project of walking it all back. What has ensued is a cover-up in plain sight. When Trump took office in 2016, Republicans faced a crisis: their party had won, but only by ushering to a minority victory one of history’s most extravagantly dishonest men. They had to stand with him or against him, and most chose to stand with him. Others chose to fade away by resigning or going home when their terms were up. Almost none of them stood up against him. The famously vindictive Trump punished any signs of disloyalty, so they were loyal. And to be loyal meant joining him in corruption and lies. “If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed ... and we will deserve it,” Lindsey Graham tweeted in the spring of 2016, before becoming one of Trump’s most grovelling sycophants. In a way, the sycophants got stronger: if truth restrains us and links us together, they unchained themselves. We make contracts with each other with words; we share information, make agreements and commitments, hold each other accountable and show who we are. Lies are broken contracts, in which words misrepresent what the speaker knows; they aim to delude, exploit and divide. The liar may get stronger, but the social fabric gets weaker. That strength is precarious, so lies have be piled atop lies to keep accountability at a distance. Of course, politicians of all stripes are notoriously shifty, and the Republican party had no great reputation for honesty previously. Many of their campaigns long before Trump could politely be called misleading. But after 2016, they clustered around the gaslighter-in-chief like bugs around a streetlight. I often think of what Trump did as disinhibition: the pallid, bashful untruths of yore were replaced by baldfaced outrages. They lost any compunction about openly contradicting themselves, and did so often, never more than with the insurrection of 6 January. As the mob was smashing its way into the building, congressman Jim Jordan had been on the house floor accusing election officials in six states of corruption. A week later he declared: “I’ve never said that this election was stolen.” But, as CNN noted: “Jordan claimed in October that Democrats were working to steal the election and spoke at a Stop the Steal rally in Pennsylvania two days after the election. In December, he said he didn’t know how he could be convinced that ‘Trump didn’t actually win’ the election.” During the hours when the mob rampaged through the US Capitol building, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy called up Trump, reportedly furious. “The president bears responsibility for the attack,” he said shortly thereafter. Then he devoted himself to winning back Trump’s favour and playing down what had happened. “Pressed on whether he regretted working to overturn President Biden’s 2020 victory, Mr McCarthy took the position that he did no such thing,” the New York Times reported in April. Then he worked hard to sabotage the investigation into what had happened, by trying to put two congressmen most loyal to the big lie, Jim Banks and the ever-disruptive champion shouter Jim Jordan, on the committee. The house majority leader, Nancy Pelosi, blocked their appointment. Banks was later caught sending out letters, seeking information from government agencies, claiming he was the ranking Republican on the 6 January committee, of which he was never in fact a member. By September, McCarthy was full team cover-up: the Guardian’s Hugo Lowell noted that McCarthy “threatened to retaliate against any telecommunications company that complied with the records requests” of the congressional committee investigating the 6 January insurrection. That’s not technically lying, but it’s certainly an attempt to prevent the truth from being known. There’s a lot to cover up, especially if you don’t want the committee to find out the extent to which Congress itself was involved in the attack on Congress. The politicians who fled in fear thereafter threw themselves into denying the threat and protecting its chief instigator. No one did so more slavishly than the then vice-president, Mike Pence, who was pressured before and during 6 January to violate the law and exercise a power he did not possess to change the election outcome. “If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency,” Trump had tweeted early that day; and then, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution”. At Trump’s instigation, the mob was chanting: “Hang Mike Pence!” Pence trivialised the event when he told the Christian Broadcasting Network: “I’m not going to allow the Democrats to use one tragic day in January to distract attention from their failed agenda and the failed policies of the Biden administration.” Capitol police officer Aquilino Gonnell, who was seriously injured defending the politicians, told NPR: “That one day in January almost cost my life. And we did everything possible to prevent him [Pence] from being hanged and killed in front of his daughter and his wife. And now he’s telling us that that one day in January doesn’t mean anything. It’s pathetic. It’s a disgrace.” One of the first lies to explode out of the insurrection was that somehow the attack on the Capitol was the work of Antifa. The very idea of Antifa, as they used it, was an older lie, a transformation of scattered individuals and impromptu groups of antifascists into a cohesive sinister gang that could be blamed for pretty much anything, anywhere. The New York Times described how on 6 January the right was claiming that the insurrection had been led by Antifa, not Trump supporters. By the end of the day, Fox was promoting it, the claim was all over Twitter, and: “Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida had stood on the ransacked House floor and claimed that many rioters ‘were members of the violent terrorist group antifa’.” The claim, the Times added, “has hardened into gospel among hard-line Trump supporters, by voters and sanctified by elected officials in the party” That is, they took the position that the riot, which at the time Republican legislators begged the president to stop, was instead a riot by an essentially imaginary leftwing organisation with no conceivable motive to prevent the confirmation of Biden’s victory. Now the investigation is closing in on the role that many in Congress played in the attack on Congress. Having fled their own mobs, they are now trying to flee the truth, and relying on the fact that a significant portion of the country prefers the lies. The Republicans who helped the failed coup along and then dismissed its import are preparing to do it better next time. The Democratic senator Brian Schatz tweeted on Tuesday: “They are organizing the next one, not as a secret conspiracy, but as a central organizing principle for the next election.” The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said: “Donald Trump has infected, and that’s the appropriate word, the Republican party with his big lie and with his desire to stop democracy. We have no choice but to move forward,” by which he meant overturn the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. 6 January was one confrontation; there’s another one coming. The lies may implode at some point, but the liars have to be defeated. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

79;79;5320;5320;‘I kept saying – don’t worry Luma, we see you’: Andrea Arnold on her four years filming a cow;2022-01-06T06:00:01Z;['Simon Hattenstone'];['Andrea Arnold', 'Documentary films', 'Film', 'Culture', 'Farming', 'Environment', 'Animal welfare', 'Animals', 'American Honey', 'Fish Tank'];"Andrea Arnold’s films are known for their spare dialogue, and in her first documentary it is more pared-backed than ever: Cow consists of 94 minutes of moos, with the odd off-camera interjection from farmhands. It is hardly a thriller (though the ending is pure Tarantino). But it is one of the most beautifully crafted and tender portraits of a life you are likely to see. Arnold, who started her professional life as a rollerskating TV presenter on the children’s Saturday show No 73, began thinking about documenting an animal’s life nine years ago. Eventually she settled on a cow. “I thought a cow would be interesting because they work so hard, getting pregnant and giving milk their entire lives. It’s a huge job they do.” She chose Luma because she was told she had a big personality and was feisty. Arnold and her team spent four years, on and off, filming her. Why did she make Cow? “I wanted to show a non-human consciousness. I was intrigued as to whether we would be able to see her consciousness if we followed her long enough.” Her friends have told her Cow is the most personal film she has made. “One friend said there was nowhere for me to hide in a documentary; it was more raw and I was more exposed, she said.” But what is she exposing? “Well, things to do with my childhood, I suppose. But I don’t talk about all that because it’s too complicated. It’s extremely messy, so I can’t really.” We meet at a cafe in south London, where she has has lived for 27 years. Arnold is a youthful 60, dressed in jeans, beret, and a fake fur coat “made of real teddy bear”. She is warm and engaging but fiendishly private. She admits to having a 27-year-old daughter, and being one of four children brought up by a single mother, but declines to answer most questions about family. However, she does it with such charm that the sparring becomes enjoyable. Bits and pieces gradually emerge, from which we can piece together a partial jigsaw.
Her films are like this, too: composed of fragments, open to different interpretations. In the autobiographical Wasp, which won the Oscar for best live action short in 2004, a single mother of four is asked out for the first time in years. She pretends she is looking after the kids for a friend and leaves them outside the pub to play without telling her date, which results in all kinds of chaos. Arnold’s narratives are rarely linear and usually elliptical, leaving us to fill in the missing details. In her first full-length work, Red Road, we only begin to understand towards the end of the film why protagonist Jackie has been stalking a newly released prisoner. After it finishes, we find ourselves rewinding the film in our head, reinterpreting all that has gone before – or simply watching it again.
Astonishingly, three of her four movies – Red Road, Fish Tank and American Honey – have won the Jury prize at the Cannes film festival. In Fish Tank, which tells the story of a 15-year-old girl finding her way in the world, there is no mention of her absent father because he’s an irrelevance. In American Honey, a road movie about a group of disadvantaged youngsters crossing America and trying to get by flogging magazines, she pretty much does away with backstory. As for her Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights, he barely utters a word – it’s all about the unspoken emotion. Arnold is a wonderful film-maker. Her movies are beautifully written (or under-written), nuanced and gorgeous to look at, even when the world they depict is brutal. They are often unbearably tense, her characters invariably living on the brink of violence or betrayal. Although Cow is a documentary, it still feels very much like an Arnold film. It starts with Luma giving birth. In a lovely extended scene she licks her baby clean of amniotic fluid and the calf starts suckling. Luma really is luminous in the pitch-black cowshed – stills from the film look like bovine Rembrandts. While Cow never anthropomorphises Luma, it does allow us to see the world from her perspective. It’s impossible to watch without imagining what is going on in her head.
There are recurrent themes in Arnold’s films – single mums and struggling children, chaotic lives, sexual and commercial exploitation. Cow fits perfectly into this pattern. Luma is the ultimate single mother, constantly pregnant, separated from her children, milked for all she is worth. Arnold’s work could easily be a misery-fest, but it isn’t because she is also alert to all that’s good in life – the intensity of youth, the first flushes of love and lust, dancing yourself to oblivion, the power of resilience. Her characters may not thrive but they are survivors. Again, Cow is consistent with that vision. We experience the purity of the mother-child bond in the first few hours after birth, the joy of the cows at spring turnout when they are let loose in the fields, the literal and metaphorical fireworks as cattle mate on Bonfire Night. As in all her work, music plays a large part. Some songs are piped into the cowsheds from Radio 1 to keep cattle and farmhands happy; others are handpicked by Arnold. Although animals are not the subject of her other films, they feature prominently. In Red Road, Jackie, who works as a CCTV security camera operator, frequently zooms in on a man with a dog – without saying a word, Arnold conveys Jackie’s sense of longing. In Fish Tank, 15-year-old Mia suffers so much trauma in silence, and it’s only when she hears her friend’s horse has been put down that she cries. And Arnold’s short Dog features one of cinema’s most disturbing animal scenes. A teenage girl and boy are having sex. As usual, we witness the scene from the girl’s perspective. While the boy thrusts away, the girl sees a dog steal his stash of dope and eat it. She laughs – at what she has just witnessed, not the boy. But the boy feels humiliated and takes a terrible revenge on the dog.
Animals have played a huge part in Arnold’s life. When she was young, the family home on a low-rise estate in Dartford, Kent, was full of waifs and strays – numerous cats and dogs, guinea pigs and gerbils, and a sheep who lived in the garden but would wander in for the occasional chat. “I remember Mum going absolutely mad when we got back with the lamb.” Her mother, who was only 16 when Arnold was born, died a couple of years ago. Were they close? “I’m not going to talk about it,” she says in a sing-song voice. Fish Tank is about the troubled and competitive relationship between Mia (an aspiring dancer, as Arnold was) and her mother. They even compete over her mother’s boyfriend Conor, played with a chilling brilliance by Michael Fassbender. At times Mia is ferocious (she headbutts a fellow schoolgirl without compunction, and abducts Conor’s daughter in a terrifying scene) yet we are always aware of her vulnerability. I ask Arnold if she could headbutt her way out of trouble as a teenager. She laughs. No, she says – she has never had a scrap in her life. “But I’ve stopped fights. I can probably count 20 fights I’ve stopped in the last few years. I’m very good at reading that kind of situation and I’m not frightened of it. It’s probably why I’m a film-maker. I’m vigilant and able to read people. I’ve got some skills from my childhood that have served me well as a film-maker.” Did she stop fights as a kid? “I tried to sometimes. But that’s difficult to talk about because; that’s a lot to do with my …” She trails off. “I can’t talk about this stuff. It involves too many people.” So instead she tells me how she stopped a fight in a pub in Essex. “One of the blokes had the guy on the ground and was kicking his head against the gutter. And everyone was just watching. The guy who was kicking him suddenly got tired, stopped and was panting and I saw there was a moment to get in there. Also because I’m a female I feel they’re not going to turn on me.” She pauses. “Though I have stopped fights and they have turned on me. I stopped a boy hitting his girlfriend. He was punching her in the street and nobody was doing anything and I got in between them. The girl ran away, and he just went mad at me. He got hold of my hair, pushed me on the ground and spat at me. Then my friend had to try to get him off me.”
What makes her intervene? “I can’t bear seeing people being cruel or violent to other people.” Has she always been fearless? “I’ve always been fearless, but I’m not tough.” She thinks about what she’s just said. “Actually fearlessness is a kind of toughness.” The young Arnold was a bright girl, who rarely got the opportunity to excel. She left her comprehensive school at 16 to take up hairdressing, hated it, and returned to the sixth form. At 18, she auditioned to be a presenter for No 73, and got the job. She looked so cool – rollerskating, glamorous, carefree – but she says she was always uncomfortable in front of the camera. “I think I look terrified. It was live so it was terrifying. Everyone I was with had done some training and I hadn’t done any whatsoever.” After seven years, when No 73 finished, she decided to reinvent herself as a director. She realised she could turn the stories she had been writing into films. Arnold disappeared from view and has rarely been seen on TV again. She was so determined to make a new start that she swapped continents to retrain at the American Film Institute of Los Angeles. In 1998, she made her first short film, Milk, about a traumatised woman who has given birth to a stillborn baby and addresses her grief by having sex with a man young enough to be her son, who ensures her breast milk doesn’t go to waste. Whatever Arnold’s protagonists have been through, they are never simple victims; they still have “lots of lights on” as she says. The same can be said of Luma. She has endured the toughest of lives, but there is never any sense of her giving up. Towards the end of the film, her udder ligaments have ruptures, she can barely be milked, and she drags her teats painfully along the floor. But, Arnold says, the more she struggled, the more stoic she became. “I sensed this huge sense of service for us. She was still doing this thing she’s been taught to do.”
The longer she spent with Luma the more she was able to read her moo music. As the animal got older, and was separated from more calves, she also seemed to become angrier, Arnold says. She is convinced Luma felt compassion for the other pregnant cows, aware of what they were about to lose. “They say the difference between humans and animals is that we can see the past and think about the future, but I could see Luma knew what’s coming when she’s pregnant. She got particularly mad when she saw the farmer taking away a calf from another cow.” Every time she does a Q&A with an audience about Cow, Arnold is amazed by the response. “We had a screening at the London film festival. People were crying, one person fainted, somebody was sick, somebody had a panic attack. Somebody said to me it made them think women’s bodies are not their own; somebody said ‘It makes me think of infertility and how hard I’ve tried for a baby’; somebody said ‘It’s made me feel about my mother and the relationship we’ve never had’; somebody talked about the relationship with a mother she did have, and somebody said it made them think about how our lives are managed.”
As for Arnold, more than anything Cow has made her think of the importance of being seen. “I kept saying involuntarily during the edit: ‘I’m seeing you, Luma. Don’t worry Luma, we see you.’ I’m not sure any farm animal really feels seen. And I wondered what that meant in terms of her existence.” Has making the film changed her? “Every film changes me. I take a long time making every film, and each one is like a massive growth for me.” She returns to the idea of being seen. “I wonder how much we see not just other animals but each other. Do we really take on board each other and listen and react to people – our families, our friends, our partners, the person on the street?” She knows she’s just made a film about a cow, but to her it feels more elemental. “It’s made me feel a lot about how we’re all connected. I think all living things feel the kindness or cruelty of other living things, so all the decisions we make about how we behave with animals, with plants, with somebody getting on the bus, are so important.” • Cow is in cinemas in the UK and Ireland from 14 January and exclusively on MUBI from 11 February";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/i-kept-saying-dont-worry-luma-we-see-you-andrea-arnold-on-her-four-years-filming-a-cow;5
80;80;5321;5321;UK accused of ‘targeted killing’ after drone strike on arms dealer to IS;2022-01-06T06:00:00Z;['Dan Sabbagh'];['Islamic State', 'Drones (military)', 'Ministry of Defence', 'Royal Air Force', 'World news', 'Syria', 'UK news', 'Military', 'Middle East and north Africa'];"Britain has been accused of reviving a policy of “targeted killing” after it emerged that the RAF had killed an arms dealer linked to Islamic State in a precision drone strike in Syria at the end of October. Reprieve, a human rights charity, asked “what are the criteria” used to justify who can be targeted in a “track and kill” drone strike, and called on ministers to tell the Commons why this strike was deemed necessary. The group’s comments come after the Ministry of Defence announced on its website, more than a month after the attack, that the crew of a Reaper drone, armed with 100lb Hellfire missiles, had “tracked a known terrorist in northern Syria”. In a brief statement, the MoD added: “And at a safe moment, when the individual was alone in a field, carried out a successful attack.” The drone raid took place on 25 October and was disclosed on 27 November. Subsequent reporting by the Syrians for Truth and Justice (STJ) group, based on interviews conducted on the ground, concluded that the victim was Abu Hamza al-Shuhail, “a well-known arms dealer in the region” who had sold weapons to several parties during the long running Syrian conflict, “chiefly Islamic State”. Jennifer Gibson, who leads for Reprieve on extrajudicial killings, said: “This announcement, slipped out on a quiet Saturday morning on the MoD website, appears to herald a new UK government targeted killing policy. “So what are its criteria for tracking and killing? How did it determine that this person was worthy of assassination? And why wasn’t parliament consulted or even informed?”
The MoD said it had not changed its policy and said the UK has “a robust target clearance process, operates under strict rules of engagement, and is fully compliant with international law”. It published “regular updates” on airstrikes conducted against IS targets for “full transparency”, a spokesperson added. The drone strike on al-Shuhail appears to have been conducted in conjunction with Turkey. Shortly after the attack, Turkish ground troops encircled a nearby farm and killed a gunman in the compound linked to al-Shuhail including two unconnected civilians who had been nearby, the STJ added. Al-Shuhail had recently relocated near Ras al-Ayn, an area controlled by the Turkish military, having been smuggled out of an area controlled by the Syrian Kurds. Kurdish defence forces had asked the arms dealer that “he help them locate IS cells in the area and find the places where IS hid weapons”, according to the local reports, a request that had him “fearing for his life”. RAF fighters and drones have been engaged in more than 5,000 missions against IS in Syria since MPs voted in favour of military intervention in the country in December 2015. Strikes in Iraq were authorised in September 2014. Reprieve said it believed the raid was the first “track and kill” drone operation targeting a known individual to be acknowledged by the UK since the killing of 21-year-old Briton Reyaad Khan in Syria in August 2015 by an RAF drone strike – although the circumstances were different. At the time MPs had not voted for air raids against IS targets in Syria, only Iraq. A fortnight later, David Cameron, then the prime minister, came to parliament to justify the targeting of Khan – describing it as “necessary and proportionate for the individual self-defence of the UK”. Intelligence indicated that the jihadist and other associates were plotting to attack “high-profile public commemorations”, Cameron added, and it emerged that the UK had drawn up a “kill list” of IS targets following the 2015 general election. Reprieve hopes the recent drone strike will be the subject of questions to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, when he appears in the Commons on Monday. There is no immediate evidence that al-Shuhail had any connection or link to the UK.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/uk-accused-of-targeted-killing-after-drone-strike-on-arms-dealer-to-is;1
81;81;5322;5322;High cost of electricity exposes UK energy policy failings;2022-01-06T06:00:00Z;['Paul Brown'];['Energy bills', 'Energy efficiency', 'Electrocomponents', 'Gas', 'Energy', 'Household bills', 'Environment'];In light of the energy crisis in the UK, installing a smart meter and heat pump as measures to help combat the climate crisis have exposed serious failings in government policy. A heat pump may be four times as efficient as the best gas-condensing boiler, but the cost of heating a home is as great because of the high price of electricity. The new year weekend of high temperatures across the UK brought this sharply into focus. The heating was off and, even though everything else in the house is electric, daily bills, measured by the smart meter, dropped by two thirds. At the same time notice of new tariffs arrived. Gas will be 8.38p per kilowatt-hour, a rise of less than 2p, while electricity will be 34.64 per kWh, 10.28p more. So electricity will continue to be more than four times the price of gas. Those who turned their backs on fossil fuels and have all-electric homes with suppliers that guarantee power only from renewables are paying a heavy price for their commitment. The distortion is caused partly by the policy of previous governments – loading electricity prices to pay for subsidies for renewables and to discourage the use of coal power stations, while subsidising gas as a cleaner fuel. For the climate’s sake this needs to change.;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/06/high-cost-of-electricity-exposes-uk-energy-policy-failings;2
82;82;5323;5323;Jurors see the bigger picture: activists who were cleared in court;2022-01-06T06:00:00Z;['Haroon Siddique'];['Protest', 'Activism', 'Extinction Rebellion', 'Greenpeace', 'Environmental activism', 'Nuclear weapons', 'Anti-war movement', 'Climate crisis', 'Slavery', 'Human rights', 'UK criminal justice', 'Law', 'UK news', 'Environment'];The acquittal of four people charged with criminal damage for toppling the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston during a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol is the latest in a series of cases in which juries have cleared protesters despite there being no question of their having carried out the actions for which they were tried. Most recent examples related to the environment, with those on trial arguing that their deeds were a proportionate response to the climate crisis. Here are some examples. Roger Hallam, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, was cleared by a jury in 2019 despite not denying causing criminal damage worth £7,000 when he sprayed the walls of Kings College London, with the words “divest from oil and gas” in protest against the institution’s fossil fuel investments. Hallam, who was acquitted along with another activist, said it showed “ordinary people, unlike the judiciary, are able to see the broader picture”. In April 2021 six Extinction Rebellion protesters were cleared of causing criminal damage to Shell’s London headquarters despite the judge directing jurors that those on trial had no defence in law. Protesters poured fake oil, glued themselves to windows and doors, broke glass, climbed on to a roof and sprayed graffiti as part of wider demonstrations across the capital. Before reaching their verdicts, the jury had asked to see a copy of the oath they took when they were sworn in. Thanking the jurors, the judge said it had been “an unusual case”. Six climate crisis activists whose protest halted the Docklands Light Railway, which serves London’s financial district, were acquitted by a jury in December 2021. Five of the Extinction Rebellion protesters climbed on top of the train with banners that read “Business As Usual=Death” and “Don’t Jail the Canaries” while a sixth glued herself to a train window. They were charged with obstructing trains or carriages on the railway and acknowledged their roles in the protest but successfully argued that their action was a lawful protest against government inaction on the climate crisis. While there has been a flurry of cases involving Extinction Rebellion recently, there have been previous examples of acquittals by juries concluding that ostensibly criminal actions were motivated by good intentions. In 2008 six Greenpeace climate change activists were cleared of causing £30,000 of criminal damage at Kingsnorth power station, Kent. The activists admitted trying to shut down the coal-fired station by occupying the smokestack but argued they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change causing greater damage to property around the world. It was the first case in which preventing property damage caused by climate change had been used as part of a “lawful excuse” defence in court. In 2001 Lord Melchett, then executive director of Greenpeace, and 27 other supporters were cleared by a court of causing criminal damage despite admitting destroying a crop of genetically modified maize. The defendants said that they acted to prevent pollen from the maize from polluting neighbouring organic crops and gardens. There have also been a string of acquittals in cases of sabotage of military equipment. In 2007, two anti-war campaigners, Toby Olditch and Philip Pritchard, who broke into RAF Fairford Gloucestershire, to sabotage US bombers at the outbreak of the Iraq war, were cleared of conspiring to cause criminal damage after they argued the B52s would have been used to commit war crimes in Iraq. In 2000, two anti-nuclear protesters who entered a dockyard planning to disarm one of Britain’s Trident submarines with an axe were cleared of conspiracy to cause criminal damage. Sylvia Boyes and River (formerly known as Keith Wright) admitted that they plotted to damage HMS Vengeance while it was docked at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, in November 1999, but claimed their actions were justified because nuclear weapons were immoral and illegal under international law.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/jurors-see-the-bigger-picture-activists-who-were-cleared-in-court;3
83;83;5324;5324;China fires hospital officials after pregnant woman loses baby due to Covid lockdown rules;2022-01-06T05:52:36Z;['Helen Davidson'];['China', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news', 'Coronavirus'];"Chinese hospital officials have been fired after a pregnant woman lost her baby after she was denied entry at a Xi’an hospital due to coronavirus lockdown restrictions. On the night of 1 January a woman in labour was denied entry to the Xi’an Gaoxin hospital because her negative test result was four hours too old. She began bleeding heavily while waiting outside, and was eventually admitted but the baby died.
The woman’s story and an accompanying video went viral on social media, and was reported by local Chinese media. A related hashtag on Weibo was viewed 600m times. On Wednesday, the Shaanxi Province and Xi’an Municipal Health Commission said it had launched an investigation and determined the baby’s death was an “accident caused by negligence”. Two hospital officials were fired and a manager suspended. The head of the Xi’an health commission also received a formal warning from the Chinese Communist party for mishandling emergency care in the city. Xi’an, a city of 13 million in Shaanxi province, is two weeks into a strict lockdown that has kept residents inside their homes and shut down entertainment venues, shops and public transport. Authorities say the lockdown has allowed them to get on top of the outbreak of Covid cases, which they said were now trending downwards. However, there have also been concerning reports of food shortages and delayed or blocked access to medical care. Strict vaccine and testing requirements for anyone seeking medical care appeared to cause confusion and prevent some people from accessing emergency treatment.
In a statement reported by state media, the hospital in the woman’s case said it had done “everything that should be done”. “Now the Health Commission and the Women’s Federation are investigating. They paid much attention to it, and they were more than fair.” The hospital has been ordered to apologise to the public, improve its processes, and ensure all patients can access emergency care. Epidemic prevention and control were not grounds for preventing a patient’s treatment, authorities said, and new “green” channels would be opened for patients with acute and critical illnesses to access treatment. On Wednesday officials also said cases were trending down in Xi’an, with most new cases detected in quarantine or closed areas. More than 42,000 people have been put into quarantine centres, according to state media. Xi’an has recorded about 1,800 cases since 9 December. China’s continued commitment to zero Covid has apparent general public support in a country that has recorded far fewer cases than many other nations despite the virusfirst being detected there. However, there are growing concerns about the impact of continued restrictions, which are getting stricter as local officials strive to prevent and respond to outbreaks or face potential punishment.

84;84;5325;5325;Country diary: The willow stems that once held the countryside together;2022-01-06T05:30:53Z;['Sara Hudston'];['Trees and forests', 'Environment', 'Rural affairs', 'UK news', 'Farming'];"What would farmers do without baler twine? Blue, pink, yellow or orange, this thin, strong, polypropylene string seems to hold the countryside together. It ties up gates, zigzags crazily across holes in fences and lashes down tarpaulins. Originally made of natural sisal fibre, baler twine was invented towards the end of the 19th century. Its primary purpose was to machine-bind hay and straw bales. But what did people use before industrialisation, when they had to rely on the materials immediately to hand? Withy, or willow, is one answer. Its slender, whippy stems have been used for millennia for weaving and fastening: the root meaning of “withy” is to twist or plait. Basketmaker Malcolm Seal cultivates willow on his smallholding near Powerstock Common, north-west of Dorchester, where he also keeps curly fleeced Gotland sheep. I visit on a day when he is harvesting coarse withies suitable for garden structures. Willow grows fast in damp earth – in one year Malcolm’s plants reach nearly three metres high. I watch as he cuts the stems close to the ground and gathers them into bundles, known as wads. He secures each wad with a withy bond, a traditional tie made from a single, long stem.
There are several stages in making a bond. First, Malcolm takes a withy stem and whirls it clockwise – this is called cranking. There’s a small, dry pop as the fibres break, then he twists it and lets the tightened stem turn back on itself. He threads the straight end through the loop and then encircles the wad, before further cranking and coiling so the tie is held in place by its own tension. That twisting, self-hold principle is an ancient method, used for all manner of materials: thatchers employed it to secure straw to roofs and hayricks. It even works for hair. In 1948, two men cutting peat in a willow-grown bog near Osterby in Germany uncovered a human head. The man’s long hair was held back in a distinctive self-tying fashion, similar to a withy bond. The Roman historian Tacitus describes this iron-age hairstyle – known as a Suebian knot – in his account of Germanic tribes, written in about AD98. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/06/country-diary-the-willow-stems-that-once-held-the-countryside-together;3
85;85;5326;5326;‘So-called border vigilance’: PM’s tough guy act on Djokovic won’t distract from failed Covid response | Malcolm Farr;2022-01-06T05:05:53Z;['Malcolm Farr'];['Australian Open', 'Australia news', 'Novak Djokovic', 'Scott Morrison', 'Australian politics', 'Victoria', 'Vaccines and immunisation'];"Novak Djokovic’s visa cancellation and possible deportation has become a scarifying issue for Australian sport and the federal government, a political break point thanks to the inattention and ignorance of the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Morrison was so busy struggling to extricate himself from the mess he had created over the provision of reasonably priced rapid Covid tests, he had no awareness of, or capacity to fully deal with, the controversy so obviously set to arrive with the Serbian tennis champion. Djokovic has previously expressed reluctance about Covid vaccination and has consistently refused to disclose his vaccination status. And it was obvious a hemisphere away he was ready to drive his worldwide celebrity and remarkable sporting record through the resolve of Australian authorities, having secured a medical exemption. No-vax Novak was confident he would be let through.
In this objective he was helped, unwittingly, by the prime minister of Australia, who finally got around to doing his job. “Rules are rules,” Scott Morrison eventually advised Djokovic, in an echo of a stern suburban dad scolding a child for staying out late. But it’s difficult to be severe with the tennis champ because the prime minister didn’t know the rules, either. On Wednesday, he duck-shoved responsibility for the world No 1 being allowed into Australia unvaccinated. “Well, that is a matter for the Victorian government. They have provided him with an exemption to come to Australia, and so we then act in accordance with that decision,” he told reporters, clearly not knowing what he was talking about. By Thursday, he had been educated on the matter and announced in muscular fashion it was a federal government matter, and the Serb was out – one of the highest-profile figures ever to be punted from Australia, pending Monday’s court hearing. “Rules are rules, especially when it comes to our borders,” Morrison said in that scolding statement. “No one is above the rules.” And he ended the reprimand with a protective assurance: “… we are continuing to be vigilant.” The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, might have been Morrison’s educator on the matter, as she issued a statement – headed “Australia’s border rules apply to everyone” – contradicting the prime minister’s Wednesday press conference ramble. “While the Victorian Government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth Government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border,” Andrews said in part of a statement. Neither Morrison nor Andrews can now breathe easily. And nor can the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne. There remain stark questions about the so-called border vigilance Morrison was so hairy-chested about. Djokovic had a visa to get to Australia. What happened when he got here is one thing, but clearly he boarded an aircraft with Australian-issue credentials saying he had a right to land here. Payne will be pressed to explain where and how that visa was issued when there are so many restrictions on the travel of vaccinated Australians. Is there a tennis service, a net accord?
Answers on these matters won’t arrive in a rush, as Morrison will wring as much political gain as he imagines he can from this. His keenness to be seen as the tough guy with Djokovic – once it was explained to him it unavoidably was his responsibility and not that of the Victorian premier, Dan Andrews – was the first sign that border protection would be ramped up. His problem is that even insulting and exploiting the world’s best tennis player will not be sufficient distraction from the growing confusion over the response to Omicron as it overwhelms towns and cities. Morrison’s admission that he gets rapid tests for free, while thunderously objecting to other Australians getting the same deal, quite simply stinks. If it’s not the hypocrisy or the deliberate misleading, it’s the broad policy failure of the federal government’s Covid response. There is only one tennis player being deported. There are thousands of Australians every day discovering they have been infected by the virus, and many others unable to get tested but who know they are stricken. None of them will feel safer because Novak Djokovic has been thrown out of town.

86;86;5327;5327;China faces shortage of PE teachers amid school exercise drive;2022-01-06T05:00:54Z;['Vincent Ni'];['China', 'World news', 'Asia Pacific'];Tan Lili, the principal of Shanghai’s Baoshan No 2 central primary school, has been wrestling with a problem in recent months: her school does not have enough physical education teachers. She is not alone. Since China embarked in 2021 on a nationwide campaign to reduce academic pressures on children and increase the amount of active time they spent outdoors, primary and middle schools across the country have been struggling. In one school, according to Chinese media, only two PE teachers are available to coach 2,600 students. One key law was passed in October, to reduce the “twin pressures” of homework and off-site tutoring on children, and drove many profit-driven education companies into bankruptcy. According to the official Xinhua news agency, the legislation asks parents to arrange their children’s time to account for reasonable breaks and exercise, thereby reducing pressure and avoiding internet overuse. Around the same time as seeking to reduce academic pressure, China has promoted policies for schools to help students exercise more. “We have 11 full-time PE teachers, but there are 43 classes … we are seriously lacking PE teachers,” Tan said in a recent interview with Shanghai TV. “The demand for PE teachers has now increased dramatically.” Some schools are encouraging PE teachers to pass on tips to parents about teaching personal fitness to their children. But still, Sun Dong, who leads the PE group at Beijing’s prestigious 101 Middle School, complained that “some of our teachers have to teach 21 classes a week”. PE teachers had for years played a minor role in the country’s education system: classes were mandatory in many provinces, but as students and their parents overwhelmingly focused on passing crucial exams, PE was rarely a top priority. A “proposal to prevent the feminisation of male adolescents” from the education ministry earlier last year also led to an increased focus on PE from primary schools to universities. Schools have been on a hiring spree in recent months. Tan’s Shanghai school recently added five professional coaches, ranging from football to badminton to fencing. And late in October, a senior official from the country’s General Administration of Sport said that he and his colleagues were exploring the possibility of allowing retired athletes to work as PE teachers part-time at schools. “I’ve been teaching PE for 20 years, and this is the very first time I have the opportunity to speak in front of you, at the school’s teacher-parents conference,” a Shanghai PE teacher said in a September post that went viral on China’s social media. China has had a long history of attempts to reduce students’ academic burdens, issuing its first directive in 1955. In the last 20 years, Beijing repeatedly promoted a nationwide “burden alleviation” campaign but critics said that without properly reforming the competitive national Gaokao exam system, it was only a slogan. But the new policy has not been equally received by parents across the country. “I’m sure the authorities’ starting point was good, but education is a whole-of-a-society issue. By simply asking schools to cut academic work and increase outdoors activity won’t necessarily help address the fundamental problem,” said one Shanghai schoolteacher and a parent, who prefers to remain anonymous. “That is: education inequality.” Mr Li, a quality control manager in Zhenzhou in the central province of Henan, said despite all the new regulations, his 6th grade daughter at Zhengzhou Ruiding primary school still has a lot of work to do. “The students are still under great pressure … After school, they spend most of their time studying and doing homework, and their spare time is still very tight.” Additional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/china-faces-shortage-of-pe-teachers-amid-school-exercise-drive;4
87;87;5328;5328;Brazil’s bars choose their customers for their politics as election nears;2022-01-06T05:00:54Z;['Tom Phillips'];['Brazil', 'Jair Bolsonaro', 'Coronavirus', 'Americas', 'World news', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Health'];"Jana Santos has an unambiguous message for Jair Bolsonaro-supporting anti-vaxxers who want to sup a Moscow Mule or Caipirinha at her bar in south Brazil. “Don’t come. We don’t want you here,” said the mixologist and bar owner who recently placed a placard at its entrance instructing unvaccinated Bolsonaristas to steer clear. Santos, 32, said she had decided to ban unjabbed Bolsonaro followers from the Cosmos Gastrobar in Curitiba as a result of his “villainous” response to a Covid outbreak that has killed nearly 620,000 Brazilians and battered businesses such as hers. “It was a cry from the heart – a protest against everything this president has put us through … He’s a wicked man,” the progressive publican said of Brazil’s far-right leader, who claims not to have been vaccinated and has repeatedly undermined Brazil’s immunisation campaign. Santos is not alone, as the poisonous political atmosphere enveloping Brazil contaminates even its pub scene and a number of watering holes tell their political opponents to get lost.
In July another local taproom, Bek’s Bar, told boozers they could buy their beer elsewhere if they insisted on backing Bolsonaro. “I’d like to let it be known that clients who support the genocide of 500,000 Brazilians and thousands of other atrocities will DEFINITELY not be missed,” its owner, Giovanna Lima, 33, announced on Instagram. “I’d prefer to go bust with dignity than go against my principles,” said the leftist bar owner who serves takeaways in bags bearing the slogan: “Get out, Bolsonaro.” Bolsonarista boozehounds are still not short of alehouse options, with their radical president continuing to enjoy the support of about 20% of voters as he prepares to seek re-election next year. In Ouro Preto do Oeste, a frontier town in the heavily pro-Bolsonaro Amazon, diners can even order pizzas named after their populist leader thanks to the rightwing restaurateur Valmir Chaves. “He’s the most patriotic president Brazil’s ever had,” said the 58-year-old during a recent visit to his Bolsonaro-themed eatery Aquarius Pizzaria. Chaves said the Bolsonaro pizza was sprinkled with chicken, olives and two portions of palm hearts in homage to the white vegetable Brazil’s president used to harvest during his childhood in rural São Paulo. As he took an order of fried chicken, Chaves remembered how he had invented the patriotic pizza, which costs 64 reais (£8.50), and decked his bar with Brazil flags after Bolsonaro’s 2018 election. “People say I adore Bolsonaro – that I’m a Bolsonaro fan. But it’s not about Bolsonaro,” said the barkeeper, whose black Hyundai has been decorated with the words: “100% Bolsonaro”. “It’s about my country – and if there was someone else doing the things Bolsonaro is, I’d support him too.” Lefties are not the only thing unwelcome in Chaves’s Bolsonarian bar. A sign on the wall informs drinkers they will not be allowed to tune into Brazil’s largest broadcaster, TV Globo, against which Bolsonaro rails, just as his mentor, Donald Trump, rails against CNN. “To clients and friends of this establishment,” it reads. “We do not watch GloboRubbish.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/brazils-bars-choose-their-customers-for-their-politics-as-election-nears;6
88;88;5329;5329;German police dogs sent off duty after ban on ‘pulling collars’;2022-01-06T05:00:53Z;['Kate Connolly'];['Germany', 'Animal welfare', 'Animals', 'Europe', 'World news'];"Berlin police dogs trained to attack perpetrators have been put on an enforced break, along with their handlers, over contradictions between the methods used to control them and a new law to prevent cruelty to dogs. The use of pulling collars to channel a police dog’s aggression towards an agitator or potential criminal contravenes the law, introduced by the former agriculture minister, which came into force on 1 January. Police said that about 49 dogs, out of about 130 used for operations from arresting perpetrators to drug and explosives detection or locating missing persons, were suspended from duty until a solution was found that would not involve officers breaking the law. A police spokesperson, Thilo Cablitz, said: “We are currently unable to deploy a section of our service dogs due to changes in the animal protection act governing dogs.” Those suspended include dogs working alongside special forces, the SEK, and those used to protect people as well as to arrest offenders.
The training of “Schutzhunde”, or protection dogs, involves being able to control when a dog ends an attack, by tugging briefly on a “pulling collar” to restricts the animal’s airway. The logic is that if a dog’s aggression, considered necessary for the apprehension, is not controlled, it could cause serious injury or death to the perpetrator. Under the new ordinance, brought into law by the former agriculture minister Julia Klöckner, the use of such punitive stimuli is no longer allowed when training dogs. While primarily introduced to improve standards of dog ownership in Germany, the rules are intended to apply to all German dogs, including guard dogs. The agriculture ministry has said its decision was based on scientific studies showing that punitive stimuli “contradicts the concept of animal welfare”. Included in the act are rules governing the all-round care and upkeep of dogs, from the size, temperature and ventilation of their kennels, to breeding practices. Dog owners are obliged to take their pets for regular walks, to spend time with them and to ensure they have contact with other dogs. Chaining dogs, except under certain circumstances and conditions, pinch collars and other equipment or practices considered to induce pain, are forbidden. Klöcker has said the need for an update to existing legislation was long overdue but had become urgent during the pandemic, as increasing numbers of people with no experience of owning pets had bought dogs, and cases of abuse were rife. Pet shop owners and breeders should also carry more responsibility for dogs’ welfare, she said. The law change has been known about for months but its effect on the daily workings of police attack dogs seems to have taken police and politicians by surprise. Stephan Kelm, the vice-chair of the Berlin branch of the police union, GdP, said a solution needed to be found, as the dogs’ suspension would have “severe consequences for domestic security”, and the union had asked for the federal interior minister, Nancy Faeser, to intervene. He said the act affected forces across Germany. “We are completely open to innovative training methods, in which it is not necessary to inflict pain. But right now we don’t know of any,” he said. Cablitz said police were having discussions with Berlin’s interior ministry. “We are in dialogue with the ministry in order to find a solution,” he said. The interior ministry has not yet commented.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/german-police-dogs-sent-off-duty-after-ban-on-pulling-collars;5
89;89;5330;5330;‘It’s a revenge’: the global success of the Tahitian dance that Europeans tried to outlaw;2022-01-06T05:00:53Z;['N/A'];['Tahiti', 'French Polynesia', 'World news'];"Wearing intricate costumes made of plants and adorned with tropical flowers, the women look spectacular. While their torsos remain completely still, somehow, impossibly, their hips are moving in circles so fast it’s almost a blur. These women are performing traditional Tahitian dance, or Ori Tahiti, in Tahiti’s annual cultural festival, the Heiva. And they’re not alone. Thousands of women across the globe, from Mexico to Japan, are doing it too. According to a report published by the French ministry of culture in 2017, there were more than 12,000 Ori Tahiti dancers in the United States and more than 10,000 in Latin America. In Japan, the movement has attracted 25,000 dancers and is projected to grow to 500,000 by 2027.
Ori Tahiti is a broad term that encompasses the many traditional dances native to the island of Tahiti, performed by both men and women. The most well-known is the ote’a, a very fast, hip-shaking dance performed by women. Another is the aparima, which features slower, more graceful body movements. Both dances are difficult to master, but absolutely captivating to watch.
“The dance itself, in my eyes it is the most beautiful, powerful, sensuous and expressive,” says Tumata Robinson, a renowned Tahitian choreographer, costume designer and founder of acclaimed dance group Tahiti Ora. “I think Ori Tahiti is very complete, you know. It’s fierce, but also elegant and powerful, graceful, feminine when we dance. I feel beautiful [when I dance],” says Moena Maiotui, one of Tahiti’s most beloved professional dancers, who has travelled around the world performing, teaching Ori workshops, and sharing Tahitian culture. YouTube videos of her dancing, both solo and with the dance group Tahiti Ora, have racked up millions of views. “It’s always good to be on stage and to share the culture and what we love and the passion and also tell the story … with our hands and share this moment with the people who are watching.” Self-expression and connecting to nature are what Ori Tahiti is about for Rina Hanzawa. Born and raised in Tokyo, Hanzawa discovered Ori Tahiti in her early twenties. “I went to dance school and I found Ori Tahiti there,” says Hanzawa. “At the time I had no clue about Tahitian culture. But I fell in love with Ori Tahiti when I tried it. The Ori movement was so natural for me – it was just very comfortable to do so I felt a strong connection with it.” What started as a casual hobby soon became an enduring passion, which led to her competing at a national level. Hanzawa now lives in Australia, where she has set up her own Tahitian dance school, Tai Pererau, in Sydney’s northern beaches. “My fire of love towards Tahitian culture will never blow out,” she said. The dance that sparked that fire, however, was almost extinguished. The arrival of Europeans in French Polynesia, along with their religion and laws, saw Ori Tahiti banned or repressed for close to 100 years.
At the end of the 18th century, dance was banned by European missionaries, who labelled it immoral. Then, in 1819, the Pomare Code, a set of laws laid down by the Tahitian monarchy, forbade traditional dancing outright. In 1842 the French protectorate allowed dancing – but with so many conditions that the practice was still repressed. It was only in the 1960s that the church began to lose influence and traditional dancing really began to be revived. During this time the first modern dance group appeared on the scene, led by Madeleine Mou’a. Damaris Caire, author of a book titled Ori Tahiti: Between Tradition, Culture and Modernity, says: “Little by little, by doing dance shows at hotels for tourists, Ori Tahiti became popular – even if the local population initially struggled to accept it.” By the 1970s, the Tahitian cultural revival was in full swing and from the 1980s onwards Ori Tahiti was rediscovered, reinvented and fully embraced by the local population.
Despite a rocky past, Ori Tahiti has today become a way for Tahitians to connect with their ancestors, their land and their language. It is a celebration of a cultural identity and pride that was almost lost to colonisation. Now, it has become one of Tahiti’s best exports. Hinatea Colombani, a Tahitian cultural expert and director of the Arioi culture and arts centre, says it is particularly satisfying to see Ori Tahiti become popular in the very countries that tried to stamp the practice out two centuries ago. “For me it’s a revenge, because they celebrate our culture,” she says. “Ori Tahiti is for me a freedom. A freedom to move, a freedom for the soul … and a really important way to escape from the everyday and connect to my ancestors and to the tradition.” This year, the Heiva Ori Tahiti Nui international 2021 – Ori Tahiti’s biggest competition – had to be held online due to the pandemic. However, it still managed to attract competitors from 12 countries and territories, including two new participants: New Caledonia and Switzerland.
Ginie Naea, from France, is a dance teacher at the Te Ori Tahiti school in Geneva. The school has more than 70 dancers, aged between eight and 68. After competing for the first time online in the international competition, they came away with fourth place in a group category and a first place for the solo ote’a – which was danced by Naea. “It was really a superb experience,” says Naea of the competition. “We danced in front of Lake Geneva and the mountains; it was just magic. The best part of the competition was actually the preparation and team cohesion that it necessitated – a connection that’s created when performing. There is a real bond between Ori Tahiti dancers, a real family that is created around the same passion. “Ori Tahiti is more than a discipline, it’s a way of life. It’s something that really completes me … an art in which I flourish – as a woman, as a friend, as a mother – it’s really part of my everyday life.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/its-a-revenge-the-global-success-of-the-tahitian-dance-that-europeans-tried-to-outlaw;5
90;90;5331;5331;Covid outbreak at Sydney nursing home leaves residents ‘petrified’;2022-01-06T04:38:35Z;['Elias Visontay'];['Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Sydney', 'Aged care', 'Social care', 'Vaccines and immunisation'];"A south-west Sydney nursing home is battling a major Covid outbreak with families now questioning the timing of booster shots and why positive cases were kept in close quarters with uninfected residents. One fully vaccinated resident who was receiving palliative care has died, and 63 more people – 38 residents and 25 care staff – have tested positive to Covid at the Bupa aged care home at Clemton Park. It’s a sharp increase since the facility activated its outbreak management plan on 21 December after a staff member tested positive. Bupa closed the 144-bed facility to all visitors at this point, however cases have steadily risen, and have since spread between the home’s separate “communities” on different floors of the complex. On Tuesday, families of residents were notified by email that a resident receiving palliative care, who had contracted Covid, had died.
Residents had been scheduled to receive their Covid-19 booster doses on 10 January, after having received their initial two doses in April and May. Management has now brought forward booster vaccinations for residents, with 31 of the 140 residents receiving the dose on Tuesday and others scheduled for this Friday. Dimitrios Kapeleris is furious at how Bupa has cared for his father, Theofanis, who has tested positive. After first learning of the Covid outbreak, Dimitrios pleaded with management to evacuate all Covid positive patients from the facility, to “avert a disaster of the likes of Newmarch House and St Basil’s”. He was worried about his father’s wellbeing and chance of surviving Covid. He was also concerned about the potential for aerosol transmission within the facility when doors were opened by staff. In Facetime video calls with his father during the outbreak, Dimitrios claims he could see staff leave the door to his room open for several minutes as they came in to clean up.
The 84-year-old suffers diabetes and has advanced dementia, and his son had already taken the precaution of taking his father to a private clinic to get his booster shot in early December (before the outbreak began), unsatisfied with the idea of leaving it until January when the rest of the home would receive it. Dimitrios claimed his request to separate positive cases was turned down. He is also critical of how Bupa communicated news about the outbreak to families. “They’re in damage control, it’s all about PR … Only now after complaining are they holding a meeting with the families and sending regular emails and, but they’re still leaving out details,” he said. “I was trying to prevent my dad from getting infected. And lo and behold, he got infected. “He’s holding up OK. But he’s scared, and I’m concerned if he deteriorates. I’m just hoping he pulls through.” Staff are checking in on Covid positive residents, in addition to twice daily clinical observations, but Dimitrios said that should be more frequent and he wanted his father to be moved to a hospital or other care facility. “This is going to be an unmitigated disaster,” he said.
At a crisis meeting with families held on Wednesday afternoon, several families raised concerns about the psychological state of their parents with dementia. A spokesperson for Bupa said that most residents were “clinically stable with only mild symptoms”. “In order to keep relatives abreast of the situation, text messages and email updates are being sent on a daily basis,” they said. The spokesperson added: “The health and safety of our residents and team members is paramount so we acted quickly to control any potential spread of Covid-19. This included closing the home to all visitors, using rapid antigen tests on all residents and members, full PPE for team members including face shields, and a deep cleaning of the home.” They also said the facility is “cohorting our team members to single communities”, and that additional agency staff have been brought in. Additionally, the spokesperson said that residents were “remaining within their own communities within the home to minimise movement in the building with team members dedicated to each community so they don’t work in other areas”. The spokesperson also refuted Dimitrios’ suggestion communication was not initially regular. They also said that a public health audit “confirmed that aerosol transmission via mixing of air from different areas of the home was not a contributing factor to Covid spreading at Clemton”. Of the 140 residents in the facility, 118 are double vaccinated. Regarding the timing of booster shots, the spokesperson said: “During the past few weeks, our home had contacted Health Care Australia a number of times to follow up booking dates for the booster program and were advised that 10 January was the only date that had been allocated”. A department of health spokesperson said that commonwealth vaccine providers have been asked to schedule a visit for all eligible residential aged care facilities by the end of January, and that it had so far contacted all facilities to schedule booster shots.

“Scheduling and timing is managed between vaccine providers and facilities to ensure clinics are held at a time suitable to the facility and their residents – there has been a focus on booster clinics where there is a higher risk of outbreaks due to community transmission.” “Booster clinics are being delivered by commonwealth vaccine providers, primary care providers and, where eligible, facilities can self-manage an onsite clinic,” the department spokesperson said. Dimitrios said he believed the policy of keeping residents in their own quarters had failed. “We had been advised that they were sealed off from each other. Then how did my dad get it when the first case was in another community (section)?” Dimitrios said his father was “one of the few” who had had a booster dose, and that family of other residents who were unboosted remain concerned. “They are petrified,” he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/06/covid-outbreak-at-sydney-nursing-home-leaves-residents-petrified;7
91;91;5332;5332;Literary mystery may finally be solved as man arrested for allegedly stealing unpublished books;2022-01-06T04:20:56Z;['Sian Cain'];['Publishing', 'Books', 'Culture', 'US news', 'New York', 'World news', 'Margaret Atwood', 'Sally Rooney'];"A mysterious fraudster who impersonated publishers and agents to steal book manuscripts in an international phishing scam may have finally been caught, with the FBI arresting a 29-year-old man at John F Kennedy airport in New York on Wednesday. Filippo Bernardini, an Italian citizen who worked at UK publisher Simon & Schuster, was arrested upon landing in the US on Wednesday. The FBI alleged that Bernardini had “impersonated, defrauded, and attempted to defraud, hundreds of individuals” to obtain unpublished and draft works. Bernardini is charged with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in a New York district court, with the indictment saying Bernardini had registered more than 160 fake internet domains to impersonate others since 2016. Bernardini’s arrest may mark the start of the end of a mystery that has fascinated and appalled the literary world for five years, during which hundreds of unpublished manuscripts have been targeted. Some authors, agents, editors, scouts and even judges for the Booker prize have been victims of phishing scams involving manuscripts of highly anticipated novels by Margaret Atwood, Sally Rooney and actor Ethan Hawke.
Those responsible created slightly tweaked email addresses to fool publishing figures, including replacing “t” with “f”, “q” with “g”, and using “r” and “n” to make “m”, as in @penguinrandornhouse.com. They would use industry lingo, such as “ms” for manuscript, and demonstrated an understanding of the publishing process, which fooled some into handing over manuscripts and information about upcoming projects or film rights. In a statement, a spokesperson for Simon & Schuster said the publisher was “shocked and horrified” by the allegations against Bernardini and that they had suspended him pending further information. “The safekeeping of our authors’ intellectual property is of primary importance to Simon & Schuster, and for all in the publishing industry, and we are grateful to the FBI for investigating these incidents and bringing charges against the alleged perpetrator,” he added. Simon & Schuster was not named in the indictment, and the Guardian understands it is not accused of wrongdoing. Publishing industry figures and authorities have been stumped for years by possible motivations behind the phishing scam, with no ransom or blackmail demands ever materialising after manuscripts were mistakenly sent on. None of the books ever turned up online, and everything from celebrity releases to debut novels by unknown writers were targeted. Some had suspected the individual was a literary scout, attempting to secure information to make film and television deals ahead of others. “If you try to find financial and economic gain, it’s of course hard to see,” Daniel Sandström, literary director of a Swedish publisher that was targeted multiple times, told Vulture last year. “But if the game is psychological, a kind of mastery or feeling of superiority, it’s easier to visualise. This is a business full of resentment as well, and in that sense, it becomes a good story.”";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/06/literary-mystery-may-finally-be-solved-as-man-arrested-for-allegedly-stealing-unpublished-books;5
92;92;5333;5333;Vulnerable Australians with Covid could miss out on lifesaving treatment due to testing delays;2022-01-06T03:32:01Z;['Tory Shepherd'];['Health', 'Greg Hunt', 'Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant'];"Vulnerable Covid patients are set to miss out on the lifesaving treatment sotrovimab, doctors say, because it must be taken within five days of getting sick. Waiting times for PCR tests and results, a lack of rapid antigen tests and the need for a GP referral could mean treatment comes too late, according to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. The health minister, Greg Hunt, announced on Monday that the federal government had bought an additional 45,000 units of sotrovimab, bringing the national stockpile to 81,000. The monoclonal antibody treatment is designed to help those who become ill with Covid and have risk factors including lung, heart or kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, being over the age of 65, and undergoing cancer treatment. Clinicians can consider its use for women in their second or third pregnancy trimester. It has a 79% effectiveness rate at reducing serious illness, hospitalisation and death.
Mark Morgan, professor of general practice at Bond University and chair of the college’s expert committee on quality care, said GPs were “crying out” for clear clinical pathways to use the treatment. “To be effective, it has to be given in the first five days [after symptoms appear], and there are all sorts of problems with getting tested and finding out if your symptoms are from Covid or not because people can’t access the PCR or rapid antigen tests,” he said. “So there are lots of difficulties finding out if you’ve got Covid, then another layer of difficulty playing catchups with the health systems as to who would access this medicine and how it would be given. “It has to be injected over half an hour, and [the patient then has to be] watched for an hour. And this is someone who’s infected.” Morgan said he didn’t think many GPs would have the proper setup established to deliver the treatment themselves and would probably then refer the patient to hospital. “The thing I’m most concerned about is the delays in testing capacity, delays in results, lack of knowledge about the treatment options in the community, so that people will miss out on the treatments.” With the focus on vaccinations, he said, treatments for the infected had been overlooked. “They let [Covid] rip before they had their ducks lined up,” he said. It’s also unclear how long the 81,000 treatments would last. In a press release from August 2021, Hunt said: “Medical experts estimate that eight to 15 per cent of adults with COVID-19 will be recommended for treatment with sotrovimab.” With more than 271,000 new cases this week, if 15% were eligible, around half the existing stockpile would be needed. At the lower end of 8%, the treatments would last four weeks if case numbers did not go up at all.
The range of 8% to 15% was estimated before the Omicron variant arrived and before high vaccination levels were achieved, which could affect the numbers of people eligible. The US has a sotrovimab shortage. Sotrovimab is an “artificial copy of natural immunity, made in a laboratory and injected into a vein”, Morgan said. It would not help someone with full immunity but those who were not vaccinated or had underlying conditions could be kept out of hospital. Rapid antigen testing, if made widely available, would speed up access to sotrovimab. Morgan said he would like to see a greater focus on available treatments as infections rise. According to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, there is a critical shortage of one form of heparin, a blood-thinning drug that has been shown to block the transmission of Covid when used as a nasal spray. There is also a critical shortage of dexamethasone, a steroid medication which can help critical Covid cases. But there is often a “reasonable alternative” to such drugs. A health department spokesperson said there were other brands of dexamethasone available, and that the TGA had approved a replacement heparin product and would continue to monitor the supply. The spokesperson also said the federal government was working “to ensure that Australians have early access to safe and effective treatments as they are made available”. Australia has an agreement for supply of 300,00 courses of molnupiravir, 500,000 courses of paxlovid, which will be used in combination with ritonavir, as well as access to remdesivir, evusheld and ronapreve, according to the spokesperson. Morgan expects Covid case numbers to keep rising sharply, and said GPs wanted guidance. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
“GPs are crying out for clear clinical pathways, and guidance and knowledge about how best to help their patients and make sure their service is integrated with pharmacies, hospitals, etc,” he said. “It’s going to really be a quite confronting couple of months.” The health department and health minister’s office have been contacted for comment.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/vulnerable-australians-with-covid-could-miss-out-on-lifesaving-treatment-due-to-testing-delays;7
93;93;5334;5334;Novak Djokovic: Australia sparks diplomatic row with visa cancellation;2022-01-06T02:35:01Z;['Sarah Martin'];['Australia news', 'Australia sport', 'Sport', 'World news', 'Coronavirus', 'Novak Djokovic'];"The decision to deport tennis star Novak Djokovic has sparked diplomatic fallout, with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, dismissing pleas from the Serbian government for Australia to reconsider the move. Speaking after the Australian Border Force decision on Thursday, Morrison revealed that diplomats from the Serbian embassy in Canberra had made formal representations to Australia about the decision to deport Djokovic for failing to meet vaccine exemption requirements. The world No 1 is is also challenging the visa cancellation in the federal court. Under Australia’s border restrictions, an unvaccinated person can only enter the country if they have a valid medical exemption. It is understood that Djokovic was relying on a previous Covid infection to claim the exemption, but this is not recognised as a grounds for an exception by the Australian government. Morrison said he understood the Serbian government’s position, but the rules “apply to all those who enter”. “I am aware of representations that have been made by the embassy here in Canberra and I understand those, but my simple point is that all countries have their border rules and these rules are not imposed against any one country or any one individual,” Morrison said. “There is no suggestion of any particular position in relation to Serbia. In fact, Serbia has been a good friend of Australia and provided very strong support, particularly on security issues globally, and we greatly appreciate that. “This is a very specific case that deals with one individual and Australia’s sovereign border laws and their fair application.”
While Morrison insisted Djokovic had not been “singled out”, the prime minister said that he had attracted the attention of Australian border authorities because of his public statements about vaccination. “They [border force] act on intelligence to direct their attention to potential arrivals,” Morrison said. “When you get people making public statements, of what they say they have, and what they are going to do, and what their claims are, well they draw significant attention to themselves. “And anyone who does that, whether they are a celebrity, a politician, a tennis player, a journalist, whoever does that, well they can expect to be asked questions more than others before you come, that is how border force works.” Morrison also read part of a letter sent by the health minister, Greg Hunt, to Tennis Australia in November making clear that a previous infection was not grounds for quarantine-free entry into Australia. “People must be fully vaccinated, as defined by Atagi, to gain quarantine-free entry into Australia,” the letter of 29 November said. “This means that people who do not meet the Atagi definition of fully vaccinated will not be approved for quarantine-free entry, regardless of whether they have received foreign vaccination exemptions. “In relation to your specific question, I can confirm that people who contracted Covid within six months and seek to enter Australia from overseas, and have not received two doses of a TGA approved or recognised vaccine … are not considered fully vaccinated.” An earlier letter was also sent to Tennis Australia from the federal health department. Morrison dismissed as “scuttlebutt” suggestions that federal officers had contacted the Victorian government to seek a solution that could have seen the Victorian government sponsor Djokovic. “There were no inquiries being made about support for a visa application, I am advised. “There were inquiries being made about whether quarantine was going to be waived … [but] that wasn’t the basis of any decisions taken.” After the decision, which is being appealed by Djokovic, the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, took to Instagram in support of the “strong” tennis great, saying they had spoken on the phone. “I told our Novak that the whole of Serbia is with him,” Vučić said. “Our authorities are doing everything to see that the harassment of the world’s best tennis player is brought to an end, immediately.” The Serbian embassy has been contacted for comment.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/06/novak-djokovic-australia-sparks-diplomatic-row-with-visa-cancellation;1
94;94;5335;5335;The Little Prince review – wistful and beguiling production casts a surreal spell;2022-01-06T01:15:23Z;['Cassie Tongue'];['Stage', 'Circus', 'Dance', 'Culture', 'Australia news', 'Antoine de Saint-Exupéry'];"The road to Broadway now includes a stop at Rooty Hill. The Sydney Coliseum Theatre opened in the western Sydney suburb in December 2019, funded in part by the Rooty Hill RSL’s gaming revenue and designed to function as both a lyric theatre and concert venue that could attract major productions – and major names – to the region. Now, by hosting a three-week season of The Little Prince – based on the beloved bestselling 1943 novella by Antoine De Saint-Exupéry and produced by the Broadway Entertainment Group – the venue has become part of an international pipeline. The production premiered in Paris in 2019 and made its Australian debut last year at the Sydney Opera House; in March, it lands at the Broadway Theatre in New York. The stage show is directed and choreographed by Anne Tournié, with co-direction by Chris Mouron. It is faithful to the book’s plot, language and structure, as well as its fabulist elements and its heartfelt insistence that the most valuable parts of life lie beyond work, routines, and habits. An aviator crashes in the desert and comes across the titular Prince (Lionel Zacharias, in bare feet and boasting a shock of blonde hair). He has left his tiny asteroid – where he rakes out the little volcanoes that come up to his knee and tends to a rose that has stolen his heart – to explore the world.
This production is designed to travel. Built from a strong foundation of visual art and movement, it blends circus arts and dance on video projections that cover the floor and backdrop and relies on these non-verbal elements for the majority of its storytelling. For the rest, there is a Narrator, played by Mouron, who also adapted the novella’s text for the stage. She speaks mostly in English and occasionally in French (the entire work is sur-titled in English); sometimes, her voice lifts in song. She guides us through the scenes as the Prince travels through space to meet an arrogant king, a bustling businessman, and a drunk, among others, before landing on Earth and making a lasting impact on the aviator.
It is still that aviator’s story, framed by his encounter with the Prince, which we see here, but Mouron speaks for every character as the story’s singular voice, and keeps the production tied to De Saint-Exupéry’s work by taking very few liberties with the language – it’s less of a new adaptation than a cross-artform translation. It’s as though the story is now a pop-up book being shown to us. Marie Jumelin’s video design is gently surrealistic, creating new skies and visual vocabulary for each planet on the Prince’s journey. When performers swing on aerial ropes to simulate flying, they seem suspended in the middle of the universe. There is often a riot of stars, which makes perfect sense: this is a story that looks constantly to the stars and remarks on their value.
Against such detailed video, Tournié’s choreography is often necessarily simple, consisting mostly of bold and broad steps that immediately suggest meaning. The Vain Man (played by Antony Cesar and who, in the production’s most trite update, is obsessed simply with taking selfies) tumbles and break dances, performing tricks on tricks, while the Rose (the heart of the show and a clear audience favourite, played by Laurisse Sulty) is given romantic, balletic shapes. Acrobatic balancing balls cleverly represent planets – the Prince walks onstage on one in his first entrance, evoking the novella’s famous illustrations of the character atop his little asteroid. The ultimate effect is more beguiling than it is persuasive. The production is almost too true to the novella; at nearly two hours long, it begins to overstay its welcome (the opening night audience – children and adults alike – became audibly restless). While its reliance on video technology is its most dazzling element, it is also its riskiest; on opening night, the spell was broken when the show was stopped for 10 minutes waiting for a generator to kick in after a power cut in Rooty Hill. And it really does feel like a spell: the movement and swelling, wistful score (by Terry Truck) weave together an invocation of our better selves – the parts of us that can be moved to tears by the grace of a dancer reaching out her hand; the parts that find beauty and purpose in connecting with others; that part of us that wants to better the world within which we live and work and love. But, like any spell, it thrives on intention: for The Little Prince to work its magic on the audience, they must be prepared to give themselves over to it. Cynics will have a tougher time. Bring your softest self. The Little Prince runs until 23 January at the Sydney Coliseum Theatre. Mask-wearing for patrons over 12 is mandatory, although patrons may take them off to eat and drink. A reduced number of foyer bars are open, and lines are socially distanced. Double-vaccination status is checked at the door. The show runs for one hour and 55 minutes, including an interval, and is in an indoor theatre. In line with current state regulations, the venue is able to seat patrons at 100% capacity.";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/06/the-little-prince-review-wistful-and-beguiling-production-casts-a-surreal-spell;5
95;95;5336;5336;Capitol attack: Biden to stress Trump’s ‘singular responsibility’ on anniversary;2022-01-06T01:00:48Z;['David Smith'];['US Capitol attack', 'US politics', 'US news', 'Joe Biden', 'Donald Trump', 'Washington DC'];"It was a day that shook America. Joe Biden will lead sombre commemorations on Thursday to mark one year since the US Capitol insurrection that left five people dead and the nation’s democracy wounded, and is expected to lay out the “singular responsibility” that Donald Trump has for the “chaos and carnage” of that day. In a speech, Biden will directly address the former president’s role in the attack and his attempts since to distract from or downplay events, the White House said. “At this moment we must decide what kind of nation we are going to be,” the president will say, according to an excerpt released by the White House. “Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? Are we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people? “Are we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies? We cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognise the truth and to live by it.” Biden has been “clear-eyed” about the “threat the former president represents to our democracy”, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said in a briefing on Wednesday. Biden has repeatedly stated that Trump “abused his office, undermined the constitution and ignored his oath to the American people in an effort to amass more power for himself and his allies”, Psaki said. “President Biden will lay out the significance of what happened at the Capitol and the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and the carnage that we saw,” she added. “He will forcibly push back on the lies spread by the former president in an attempt to mislead the American people and his own supporters, as well as distract from his role in what happened.” The president is also set to praise the bravery of outnumbered police officers on the scene and outline the unfinished work that America needs to do to heal, the White House said.
Defeated in the 2020 presidential election, Trump incited his supporters to storm the Capitol and interrupt certification of Biden’s victory. Scores of police were beaten and bloodied and congressional offices were ransacked in the worst ever domestic attack on the seat of US government. Trump this week cancelled his own anniversary event – a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida that had been scheduled for the evening of 6 January – reportedly at the urging of advisers. A year on from the attack, polls show Americans are still divided in their perceptions of what unfolded and why. The anniversary offers Biden, who promised to bring the nation together, an opportunity to reassert a fact-based account. He and and Vice-President Kamala Harris will speak on Thursday morning at the US Capitol. “The president is going to speak to the truth of what happened, not the lies that some have spread since, and the peril it has posed to the rule of law and our system of democratic governance,” Psaki told reporters on Tuesday. Biden will put an extra spotlight on the role of Capitol police and others on the scene, Psaki said. “Because of their efforts, our democracy withstood an attack from a mob, and the will of more than 150 million people who voted in the presidential election was ultimately registered by Congress.” Psaki was asked at the press briefing what the president’s message will be to the many Republicans who believe Biden stole the election from Trump, despite overwhelming contrary evidence. “What he’s going to continue to do is speak to everyone in the country. Those who didn’t vote for him, those who may not believe he is the legitimate president, about what he wants to do to make their lives better,” the spokesperson replied. Other events at the Capitol on Thursday will include a moment of reflection with staff on the House of Representatives floor, a moment of silence on the House floor, a conversation with the presidential historians Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jon Meacham, testimonials from members of Congress and a prayer vigil. Four people died on the day of the riot and one Capitol police officer died the day after. Four officers have since taken their own lives. The crowd called for the then vice-president, Mike Pence, presiding over the electoral college vote count, to be hanged.
But Trump, fellow Republicans and rightwing media personalities have pushed false and misleading accounts to downplay the attack, calling it a non-violent protest or blaming leftwing activists. Even Pence has dismissed it as “just one day in January”. Congressional Republicans are expected to keep a low profile or stay away from Thursday’s events. Trump had been expected to create a split-screen moment by pushing his counter-narrative at a televised press conference, but he abruptly scrapped the plan on Tuesday. In a statement, the former president criticised a House select committee investigating the 6 January insurrection, which continues its work and on Tuesday issued a letter seeking the cooperation of the Fox New host Sean Hannity, who exchanged messages with Trump and his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, in the days leading up to the attack. Trump said that he was cancelling his conference “in light of the total bias and dishonesty of the January 6th Unselect Committee of Democrats, two failed Republicans, and the Fake News Media”, and would address the issue instead at a rally in Arizona on 15 January. The ex-president was reportedly talked out of holding a press conference by allies. Senator Lindsey Graham told the Axios website that he discussed the subject with Trump over a weekend golf match in West Palm Beach, Florida, arguing that “there could be peril in doing a news conference … Best to focus on election reform instead.” Separate from the House investigation, the justice department is leading the prosecution of rioters who invaded the Capitol. More than 700 people have been charged so far in one of the biggest criminal investigations in American history. More than 30 have received jail sentences. Trump was kicked off Twitter after the Capitol attack for statements encouraging violence. He was impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate, leaving the way open for him to seek the White House again in 2024. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that 72% of Republicans say Trump does not really bear responsibility for what happened, 58% of Republicans believe Biden’s election was not legitimate and 40% of Republicans and independents say violence against the government is sometimes justified.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/us-capitol-attack-anniversary-joe-biden-police;1
96;96;5337;5337;Moving back to Australia mid-pandemic was like entering a time warp | Jacqueline Housden;2022-01-06T00:37:19Z;['Jacqueline Housden'];['Family', 'Sydney', 'Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Parents and parenting'];"It will be like a real-life Frayed, I joked to friends. We’ll appear, slightly disoriented, in Sydney’s southern, faded beach-side suburbs, a place I thought I’d long since left behind. I’ll even wear the dresses. After 18 years of living in the UK, returning to Australia with a small family in tow was always going to be an adventure/insane, especially in the middle of a pandemic. But my head was only filled with the good stuff: the smell of eucalyptus, glimmering green ocean pools, the warm embrace of family and friends, and sweet non-Covid freedom. The reality, as always, was something else. Because moving home meant moving back in – at least temporarily – with my parents, and to the house I grew up in. “It won’t be for long,” I assured my husband, who looked a bit pale every time we went over the plans involving his in-laws. “It might even be nice? Anyway, we’ll find our own place really quickly.” But I was wrong.
Naively, I thought the heart-stopping lead up to escaping plague island would be the worst of it. Negotiating what to do if the sudden cut to arrivals caps meant we got bumped off our flight at the last minute, job interviews at ungodly hours in a half-packed up house, keeping the kids isolated for the last week as Delta tore through our village, saying goodbye without actually going inside anyone’s house – surely these were the hardest moments? Quarantine, we foolishly reasoned, would be a breeze in comparison. After arriving on a ridiculously empty plane (12 passengers) and being ushered into our confines, it was clear that once again, we were mistaken. You don’t truly know the meaning of panic until you spend two weeks in an apartment with a balcony 30 floors up and a fearless, outdoor-loving three-year-old. On our penultimate day in the high-rise prison and after four Covid tests, a doctor, soldier, policeman and a nurse knocked on the door. It sounded like a bad joke.
“Well you’ve tested negative,” the doctor said, as all four of us lined up in front of them. “But now we are just going to … um, look at you.” We stared back – pasty white, full of two weeks’ worth of quarantine food and stale air. “Yep, you look healthy,” he said. The truth, though, is that we looked like shit.
Our day of release into the Australian wilds came. An hour after scrambling into my dad’s car we were at the beach, diving into the cool, clear water as Australians in winter coats looked on in horror. And suddenly we were back. Back in my old bedroom, an achingly bad Smashing Pumpkins inspired mural staring at me from above the cupboard doors (what is it that compels parents to only preserve the embarrassing things?). Back around the dining table I spent my childhood at, squabbling with siblings. Back at my old primary school, so that I could enrol my son, while wondering what kind of life choices we were making. Back in my old neighbourhood, despite, many many moons ago, gleefully joining a FB page “I left the shire”. Back in a country where Covid, unlike in the disease-ridden nation we’d just left, seemed like a relatively new phenomenon. Our conversations on the pandemic were thrust 18 months in the past. “Well you don’t understand, we haven’t had Covid here, until now!” “But you don’t understand how many lockdowns we’ve lived through!”
Perhaps a bit more unexpectedly, other facets of Australian life made us feel we’d flown into the past. “Is it electric?” My three -year-old would always ask when he saw other people drive to the house (but obviously, not enter).
Eight years since being wed, I found myself reunited with my maiden name when authorities refused to recognise my British marriage certificate. “But it’s the same head of state!” I wailed at various uninterested call centres. Waiting days for bank transfers, not being able to buy booze in the supermarket, a government that won’t address the realities of climate change (guys, even Boris Johnson talks about it) – the time warp was everywhere. Some things had changed though – mainly the horrifically bloated house prices and impenetrable rental market, meaning our stay at casa parental appeared infinite. In the first few days, some rules were laid down. Mainly for the kids … I think. There was the hot water limit, no sand in the washing machine, and a special area the two boys were forbidden to enter, where my dad kept a prized clarinet. It didn’t take us long to break them. The next day, I spied my youngest, crouching silently in the no-go zone, concentrating, his sweaty hands fingering the keys.
There was also work to negotiate in this topsy-turvy world. I walked into my first day at the Guardian, not by prancing into a bustling newsroom, but by stepping into the fibro granny flat, where my nan once lived, to sit at a rickety camping table upon which I tried to steady my laptop and monitor. Oddly, my dreams of our new life had not included my mother bursting into work meetings holding a kilo of raw chicken and launching into a raft of complicated cooking options, or my dad rushing past to use the spare fridge as I attempted to look vaguely professional on a Zoom call. Salvation did come though. Three months after setting foot on Sydney soil/sand, we escaped to our own place. A day after moving out we nipped back for some leftover bits. “I miss you!” my mum exclaimed as I entered the hallway. I looked at her, quizzically. “Are you sure?” I ask, while scanning the house, which now looks clean and calm. No screaming children flying through the kitchen or pouring all the bath water onto the floor or eating all the Tim Tams. “Yes” she says, with meaning. And in a moment, I remember why, despite everything, coming back was also the best.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/06/moving-back-to-australia-mid-pandemic-was-like-entering-a-time-warp;5
97;97;5338;5338;Lost in the storm: Novak Djokovic sees Australian Open dreams blown away | Tumaini Carayol;2022-01-06T00:11:33Z;['Tumaini Carayol'];['Australian Open 2022', 'Australian Open', 'Tennis', 'Australia sport', 'Australia news', 'Sport', 'Novak Djokovic'];"Novak Djokovic’s hopes of returning to the Australian Open and competing for a record 21st grand slam title and a shot at tennis immortality crashed in astonishing fashion on Thursday as he was denied entrance into Melbourne, Victoria at the airport and his visa was cancelled due to insufficient evidence to support a medical exemption. His journey to that moment reveals much about him. Towards the end of last year, as thoughts shifted to the season ahead, and players considered their participation at Melbourne Park, Djokovic gave an interview to Serbian publication Blic. He described questions about his vaccination status as “inappropriate” and he bemoaned the role of the media. He was pointedly direct: “Your editors can take what I have just said and turn it into a scandal,” he said. “I do not want to be a part of that storm.”
During the first week of the Australian tennis summer, the storm arrived when Djokovic announced on social media that he had received an “exemption permission” to travel to Australia without being vaccinated. Over the past few months, the vaccination requirements for players wishing to compete at the Australian Open have left a profound mark on the professional tours. Uptake of Covid vaccines in tennis had been extremely slow, but once the Victoria state government rules were confirmed, the rate of vaccination rose. It only made the world No 1’s unresolved status more conspicuous. While Djokovic never explicitly revealed his vaccination status, he has offered numerous indications of his stance. Long before vaccines were available, he stated his concern about having to be vaccinated in order to travel. He has often stressed the importance of embracing “natural” solutions; early in the pandemic he held Instagram live conversations in which he spoke of how the power of gratitude could “turn the most toxic food, or maybe most polluted water into the most healing water.” After having surgery on his right elbow in 2018, a procedure that has allowed him to win nine grand slam titles since, he said that he cried for three days. His belief in alternative medicine is complemented by his commitment to alternative history. He frequently retreats to Visoko, in the hills of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he meets up with the businessman Semir Osmanagic – whose claims that there are ancient man-made structures with magical healing powers, refuted by scientists, have turned the hills into a lucrative tourist destination. Djokovic has also expressed his support for the ultranationalist alternative historian Jovan Deretic, whose writings claim, among other things, that numerous European cultures, including ancient Greeks, Celts and Etruscans, are descended from Serbs.
Djokovic is unyielding in his commitment to his beliefs away from the court, however questionable they are, and that single-mindedness is also visible in his faith in the methods that have led to his on-court success. Since the criteria for the Australian Open became clear, it always appeared that Djokovic intended to find a way to compete at the tournament, but only without compromising those beliefs.
Last year, one of the defining images of the chaotic Australian Open was the continued presence of the tournament director, Craig Tiley, on television as he managed the sudden lockdown that prevented crowds attending much of the event. After Djokovic’s announcement, Tiley returned to a similar role yesterday as he stressed there had been no favourable treatment for Djokovic and reinforced the strength of the medical exemption process. The exemption applications were reviewed by two independent panels of experts, one assembled by Tennis Australia and another by the Victorian government, which Tiley described as a more rigorous process than for regular citizens. But further obstacles emerged on Tuesday, when Australia’s home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, said it was the federal government that would “enforce our requirements at the Australian border”, whatever Tennis Australia and the Victorian government might have decided about a non-vaccinated player taking part in the tournament.
Djokovic is popular with a considerable group of players due to the concern he has expressed for the lower-ranked members of the ATP Tour but, as the world No 1, he is also a clear beneficiary of the privileges afforded to top players. The cynicism that some have was reflected in comments from Jamie Murray, who suggested he does not believe he would have received an exemption, and Alex de Minaur who subtly described the subject as “interesting” and hoped that other applicants received the same treatment. In the end, he was sharply dealt with. The clear and simple solution for the world No 1 would have been to arrive in Australia vaccinated and without issue, but the federal government, Victoria state and Tennis Australia also shoulder significant blame for their contributions in allowing a player to travel for a full day before rejecting him at the border. If Djokovic’s application was tenuous enough to be denied on arrival, the medical exemption process that was defended so stringently by Victoria State and Tennis Australia was a monumental blunder. As Djokovic was turned away and forced to grapple with his shattered dreams, one reality was difficult to escape. In this storm, everybody had lost something.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/novak-djokovic-flies-into-australian-open-vaccination-storm;4
98;98;5339;5339;Buy now, pay later customers unaware of debt risks, warns Which?;2022-01-06T00:01:47Z;['Rupert Jones'];['Borrowing & debt', 'Consumer affairs', 'Payday loans', 'Money', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Financial Conduct Authority', 'Consumer spending', 'Regulators', 'Economics'];"Stronger safeguards are needed to protect the millions of UK shoppers who use “buy now, pay later” deals because many people do not realise they are taking on debt, a consumer body has warned. Buy now, pay later (BNPL) lets shoppers delay payment for an item with no interest or charges – unless you fail to pay it back on time, at which point some firms impose late fees. The three main BNPL firms are Klarna, Clearpay and Laybuy, and this form of unregulated interest-free credit has enjoyed explosive growth during the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among the under-30s and those with tight finances. In response to concerns, the government announced last February that BNPL would be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, though the rules are unlikely to take effect until later this year or in 2023. A Treasury consultation, which closes on Thursday (6 January), will be followed by an FCA consultation.
In the meantime, stronger safeguards – such as affordability checks and making small print more accessible – are needed now, according to the consumer organisation Which? It said many of the BNPL users it had interviewed did not think of these deals as a form of credit – instead, they described them as a “way to pay” or a “money management tool”. This meant they could unwittingly be exposing themselves to a range of potential problems if they failed to pay back on time, such as late fees, black marks on their credit report or having their case referred to a debt collector.
Though BNPL is a form of credit, it works differently to more traditional methods of borrowing such as credit cards. For example, not all BNPL schemes run “hard” credit checks, whereby a full search of someone’s credit report is carried out. Rocio Concha, the director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said: “BNPL schemes can offer speed and convenience at the checkout, but our research shows that many users do not realise they are taking on debt or consider the prospect of missing payments.” The consumer body said that, “given the immediate risk,” BNPL firms should make their terms and conditions more accessible now. It added that affordability assessments should be carried out for all transactions before regulation is introduced.";https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/06/buy-now-pay-later-customers-unaware-of-debt-risks-warns-which;2

100;100;5341;5341;Carmakers report booming UK sales of electric vehicles;2022-01-06T00:01:47Z;['Jasper Jolly'];['Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars', 'Greenhouse gas emissions', 'Environment', 'Technology', 'Business', 'UK news'];Booming electric car sales were a bright spot in a tough car market last year amid disruption to global supply chains hitting manufacturers, according to fresh data. In its annual sales snapshot for 2021, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said carmakers sold 190,000 battery electric cars across the country last year, accounting for about 11.6% of total sales. Reflecting growing appetite for greener vehicles, sales rose from 108,000 in 2020, when battery-powered cars accounted for just 6.6% of new cars bought in Britain. In December 2021 alone, electric cars made up 26% of sales, a record for a single month when physical dealerships were allowed to open during the Covid pandemic. Against a backdrop of global supply chain disruption and shortages of crucial semiconductor chips, overall UK car industry sales for the year were up just 1% from 2020 levels to 1.65m, and remained almost a third below total sales in 2019. However, sales of battery electric vehicles were a bright spot for the industry, the SMMT said, as Britons bought more electric cars in 2021 than in the previous five years combined. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said thelack of microchips used in everything from windscreen wipers to in-car entertainment systems would continue to serve as a drag on the car industry during 2022. “[It] will undermine the market for the rest of the year,” he said. “We think demand is still there, demand is still strong,” Hawes told reporters. “The challenge is how to supply to customers.” Some manufacturers have managed to cope with the disruption better than others. Tesla was the standout electric performer, with its Model 3 becoming the first electric car to rank among the top 10 marques for overall sales. After reporting record deliveries this week, Tesla’s market value has surged in recent days to $1.2tn (£883bn) – more than the next 10 carmakers combined, according to data company Sentieo. The Model 3 was beaten to the UK top spot by Vauxhall’s Corsa, which also meant that Ford’s Fiesta lost its title as the bestseller for the first time in 12 years. Hawes said the rise of the electric car share meant that there was a “significant reduction” in the average emissions of cars sold in the UK for the second year in a row, following three years of rising emissions associated with bulky sports utility vehicles (SUVs). Although the industry lobby group has not yet completed analysis of the sales data, Hawes suggested it may be in the order of 10% or more. Reflecting the fallout from the pandemic, overall UK sales in 2020 and 2021 were the lowest since 1992. The industry is hoping for a recovery in the coming months given signs of elevated demand such as used cars costing more than newer models. Before the emergence of the Omicron variant, the SMMT forecast that car companies would recover to sell 1.96m cars in 2022. However, Hawes said the industry remained worried by signals from the UK government as ministers push for electric cars to go from one in every 100 on Britain’s roads to one in three by 2030, when sales of new cars with traditional internal combustion engines will be banned. He criticised two cuts to grants for electric cars during 2021, patchy investment in on-street chargers, and a delay on plans to force car parks to install a charger first revealed by the Guardian. “It’s a confusing message,” Hawes said. “If you’re going to achieve this it’s a massive ambition to get the entire market to move to net zero by 2030/2035, so you need to use every lever at your disposal and have a clear message to the consumer that this is the right thing to do and something that will work for the consumer. “Anything that brings into doubt that commitment doesn’t help the consumer that might be wavering.” Top 10 cars overall Vauxhall Corsa Tesla Model 3 Mini Mini Mercedes-Benz A-class Volkswagen Polo Volkswagen Golf Nissan Qashqai Ford Puma Kia Sportage Toyota Yaris Top 10 battery electric vehicles Tesla Model 3 Kia Niro Volkswagen ID3 Nissan Leaf Audi e-tron Hyundai Kona Mini Mini Renault Zoe Vauxhall Corsa MG ZS;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/06/uk-carmakers-report-booming-sales-of-electric-vehicles;3
101;101;5342;5342;Human remains found near suspected origin of Colorado wildfire;2022-01-05T23:52:06Z;['N/A'];['Colorado', 'US news', 'Wildfires'];"Investigators have found partial human remains in an area near the suspected origin of the destructive Colorado blaze that broke out last Thursday. In a statement on Wednesday, the Boulder county sheriff’s office said investigators located partial human remains of an adult in the Marshall area south of Boulder. Authorities are conducting a separate search for a person reported missing in the hard-hit community of Superior.
The late-season wildfire pushed by hurricane-force winds tore through two densely populated Denver suburbs, consuming nearly 1,000 homes and becoming the most destructive wildfire in the state’s history. The fast-moving blaze forced 35,000 to flee their homes but so far only two people are missing. It’s a remarkably low number of possible casualties, according to disaster experts and authorities, all the more so because a public alert system did not reach everyone and the wintertime blaze caught many people off-guard. Several factors broke in favor of the evacuees: the blaze came during daylight and over the holidays when many were at home in mostly affluent neighborhoods where most residents have easy access to vehicles and could flee because the region has an extensive road network. It also might have helped that the area has seasoned emergency management personnel who have worked other recent wildfires, major floods in 2013 and a supermarket mass shooting last March. “In terms of the big picture it’s a really miraculous evacuation,” said Thomas Cova, a University of Utah professor who researches emergency management and wildfire evacuations. “So close to populated areas … spot fires everywhere and 100mph winds – I think it’s incredible that’s there’s only two people missing.” Officials have not said exactly how many people were contacted through the emergency system, which sends a recorded alert or text to phones. The alert undoubtedly saved lives, but some residents affected by the fire complained in the aftermath that they never received it. Neil Noble, who fled his Louisville home on Thursday, said the first he heard of the fire was from a FedEx delivery driver who knocked on his door to drop off a package. After setting out for an errand and seeing gridlocked traffic as the smoke plume grew, he decided to leave with his three teenage children. “I’ve talked to dozens of people, even those whose houses burned down, and nobody seems to have received any kind of notification,” he said. But while the emergency notification system didn’t reach everyone, Boulder-area residents have seen enough fires along the Front Range communities at the foot of the Rocky Mountains to react quickly when smoke appears on the horizon, she said. Sharpening that awareness of danger is a growing understanding that climate crisis is making wildfires worse even as subdivisions creep deeper into fire-prone areas. “I think one of the shifts that is going to follow this fire is that people are going to start thinking, ‘Am I at risk? I thought I was safe, living in a suburban area,’” she said. “I don’t think it’s a bad thing to question that. Anything that can help people to get more prepared for the hazards we face is a good thing.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/colorado-wildfire-human-remains-marshall-fire;4
102;102;5343;5343;‘An important gap’: Conte admits Chelsea are much stronger than Spurs;2022-01-05T23:49:53Z;['Louise Taylor'];['Carabao Cup', 'Chelsea', 'Tottenham Hotspur', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Antonio Conte acknowledged Chelsea were “much stronger” than Tottenham Hotspur after watching his side get outclassed at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night. “There’s an important gap, an important difference, there’s a big job to do to retrieve the situation,” said Tottenham’s manager following Chelsea’s 2-0 Carabao Cup semi-final, first leg win.
It was not the first return to his former club Conte would have desired in the wake of his sacking by Chelsea in 2018 but, after seeing his team sunk by Kai Havertz’s opener and a comedic Ben Davies own goal, the Italian was in no mood to sugar-coat Tottenham’s situation. Stressing the superiority of Thomas Tuchel’s side, he suggested there would be no quick fixes. “Last season Chelsea won the Champions League and this is enough to explain the difference between us and them,” said Conte who took charge of Spurs in November. “We need time, so much time, to retrieve the situation. You cannot do this in only six months or one year. They were much stronger than us. I do not see a solution in this transfer window. “It was a difficult game, difficult from the start, Chelsea were much better but we are talking about one of the best teams in Europe, in the world. If you compare the two teams there is not a comparison.
“I know the situation, it is very clear in this moment there is an important gap. If we think we are close [to Chelsea] we are not in the right way.” Although Tuchel cautioned the tie is “not yet decided”, Chelsea’s manager looked suitably delighted at the end of an evening on which he recalled Romelu Lukaku.
“It seems like a deserved win, an excellent result,” he said. “It reflects the game. We could have scored more but it is hard to score against Tottenham. We did create a lot, some huge chances. We never lost the focus, never lost the commitment; it was impressive. The team was very focused, very open-minded.” Tuchel, who revealed Havertz broke a finger in the first half, expressed satisfaction with Lukaku following the striker’s re-admittance to the first team fold in the wake of his apology following a well-documented, and controversial, Italian interview. Having, perhaps generously, described Lukaku’s often underwhelming display as “good”, Tuchel said he was “absolutely happy” with the Belgian. “Romelu can handle pressure and adversity. It was a good performance, he contributed a lot to our defensive set up and had chances. I liked how he played.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/antonio-conte-admits-there-is-no-comparison-between-chelsea-and-spurs;4
103;103;5344;5344;Jacob Rees-Mogg urges Rishi Sunak to ditch impending tax rises;2022-01-05T23:49:03Z;['Jessica Elgot', 'Rob Davies', 'Peter Walker'];['Inflation', 'PMQs', 'Politics', 'House of Commons', 'UK news', 'Angela Rayner', 'Boris Johnson', 'Energy bills', 'Business', 'Consumer affairs', 'Household bills', 'Labour', 'Conservatives'];"Jacob Rees-Mogg has asked Rishi Sunak to reconsider impending tax rises as the chancellor and the prime minister came under sustained pressure from Conservative MPs to tackle rising costs of living. Ministers are examining further targeted measures to mitigate soaring energy costs for vulnerable households including potentially extending the warm homes discount – but are set to reject a VAT cut. During a cabinet debate on Wednesday, Rees-Mogg is understood to have suggested the chancellor should ditch the impending 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance to ease the squeeze. One source said Rees-Mogg did not get widespread support from other ministers, but he has long been known to be sceptical of the plan, presented by Johnson as an additional £12bn in funds to tackle the NHS backlog and reforms for social care. The other key sceptic over the rise, David Frost, quit the cabinet before Christmas. It came as a summit of industry leaders with the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, ended without agreement on demands from some suppliers for a £20bn loan scheme to rein in bills driven upwards by high wholesale prices and a wave of energy supplier failures.
Sources said that at the cabinet meeting Sunak mounted a robust defence of the mitigations the government has already put in place to help households who will be faced with rising energy costs and tax rises from April – citing the universal credit taper cut and a £500m household support fund. But officials have been tasked with trying to find any other measures that could have a significant impact, including examining extending current measures like the £140-a-year warm homes discount. A government source suggested the timing of any intervention would depend on negotiations with industry before the decision on the price cap was made in February. Another option is removing VAT on energy bills, a move that MPs have lobbied for but over which Johnson has expressed public scepticism, calling it a “blunt instrument”. One cabinet minister said Sunak believed 5% of VAT on energy bills was unappealing as it would probably be a permanent loss of revenue. But Johnson’s spokesperson reiterated that the government would act to lessen the burden. “We will listen to consumers and businesses. We are mindful of the increase in energy prices and the effect it has across the country,” he said. Calls are also growing from Conservative MPs for the government to remove green levies, used to fund renewable energy schemes as well as the warm homes discount itself, and reform of the energy price cap. At PMQs, MPs lined up to express concern over rising prices. John Penrose demanded “structural reform to the energy price cap rather than just resetting it later this year”. Caroline Johnson, another Tory MP, said constituents were contacting her daily about “rising utility bills and the cost of fuel for their cars” saying they needed a “reliable and affordable source of energy”.
DUP MP Sammy Wilson said the PM should “use our Brexit freedom” to review the VAT on bills. Twenty Tory MPs, including Robert Halfon and Steve Baker, wrote to Johnson over the weekend to urge him to cut VAT on energy bills and remove the environmental levy. One minister raised concern about the damage Labour could do on the issue, saying the cost of living is “going to be a massively effective Labour attack line”. Kwarteng convened another meeting of energy bosses on Wednesday to continue talks on a loan scheme backed or administered by the government but funded by a commercial lender. The business secretary has insisted risk must not be borne by taxpayers and sources described discussions as a “slow burner”. Ofgem, the energy regulator, is due to announce the level of the next energy bill cap on 7 February, amid concern that average bills will rise from £1,277 to more than £2,000 when the cap comes into effect on 1 April. “We’re in something-must-be-done territory,” said one energy industry source, adding that there was a “ticking clock” until Ofgem’s decision. “It’s not impossible to do something after that but one imagines you’d want to do it before that because otherwise it won’t be a very happy story for all concerned.” At PMQs, Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner who stood in for an isolating Keir Starmer, said families would face an onslaught of high bills and higher taxes, another Tory sore point. Labour released new analysis that suggested low income families will see their tax burden rise by nearly a fifth – outside the planned national insurance rise. The party highlighted data from the Office for National Statistics analysis comparing direct and indirect taxes as a percentage of gross income for the poorest fifth of households. Tax as a percentage of gross income rose from 36.4% to 42.4% between 2017-18 and 2019-20, a six percentage point increase. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said there was compelling reason to remove VAT from energy bills. “Right now, people are being hit by a cost-of-living crisis which has seen energy bills soar, petrol and food prices up and the weekly budget stretched. “On top of the highest tax hikes in 70 years, Conservative complacency is leaving working people paying the price.” Rayner castigated Johnson over the impact of inflation and rising bills, saying: “In October the prime minister said that fears about inflation were unfounded, but working people across the country are starting the new year facing rising bills and ballooning prices. So how did he get it so wrong?” Johnson insisted he “said no such thing” but in an interview with Sky News in October, he had said: “People have been worried about inflation for a very long time, and those fears have been unfounded.” At the end of prime minister’s questions, Rayner raised a point of order, noting this and asking if Johnson “would like to correct the record”, which he did not.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/05/boris-johnson-and-angela-rayner-clash-at-pmqs-over-energy-prices-and-inflation;1
104;104;5345;5345;Merrick Garland vows to pursue all those responsible for 6 January attack;2022-01-05T23:30:55Z;['Lauren Gambino'];['Merrick Garland', 'US Capitol attack', 'US news', 'US politics', 'Biden administration', 'Joe Biden'];"The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, on Wednesday vowed that the justice department would hold accountable all those responsible for the deadly 6 January attack, whether they were physically present at the Capitol or not. Garland’s remarks come as he faces growing calls from lawmakers, legal experts and former elected officials to intensify the department’s investigation into the events of Capitol assault, and in particular to prosecute those who helped orchestrate the failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election results, including Donald Trump and his associates.
In a solemn speech on the eve of the first anniversary of the assault on the seat of government, Garland said it did not matter whether the perpetrators had been present at the Capitol riot or committed other crimes that wrought chaos on that day. “The justice department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law – whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Garland said in his address, delivered from the justice department’s Great Hall in Washington. “We will follow the facts wherever they lead.” Garland recounted in detail the brutality of the day, contesting a rightwing revisionist narrative that the attack was not violent. Officers had been assaulted with pipes and poles, beaten and shocked with stun guns, he said. One officer had been dragged down the stairs by rioters, while lawmakers and the vice-president fled for their lives. “As a consequence, proceedings in both chambers were disrupted for hours – interfering with a fundamental element of American democracy: the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next,” he said. “Those involved must be held accountable, and there is no higher priority for us at the Department of Justice.” Garland did not mention Trump by name, and in keeping with the justice department’s longstanding rule not to comment on ongoing investigations, he did not detail any possible leads the department was pursuing related to the former US president, his family or his allies.
But the carefully crafted speech seemed designed to address concerns about the focus of the investigation. Garland said he understood the intense public interest in the case and promised that the actions taken by the department so far “will not be our last”. The department’s work so far, he explained, was laying the foundation for more serious and complicated cases. “In complex cases, initial charges are often less severe than later charged offenses,” he said. “This is purposeful as investigators methodically collect and sift through more evidence. “There cannot be different rules for the powerful and the powerless,” he added. The investigation into the events of 6 January was one of the “largest, most complex and most resource-intensive investigations” in the nation’s history, Garland said. To date, he said, investigators had issued 5,000 subpoenas and search warrants, seized 2,000 devices, viewed 20,000 hours of video footage, searched 15 terabytes of data and received 300,000 tips from the public. More than 700 people in nearly all 50 states and the District of Columbia have been charged for their roles in the insurrection, which left 140 law enforcement officers injured. Five officers who defended the Capitol that day have since died. Reading their names aloud, Garland asked for a moment of silence to remember the fallen officers. On Thursday, Democratic leaders in Congress will host a day of remembrance events, beginning with speeches from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the US Capitol. Previewing his speech, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Biden would acknowledge “the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and carnage” of 6 January. “The president is going to speak to the truth of what happened, not the lies that some have spread since, and the peril it posed to the rule of law and our system of democratic governance,” Psaki said, adding that Biden was “clear-eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy and how the former president constantly works to undermine basic American values and rule of law”. Garland’s remarks extended beyond the events of 6 January. He lamented a rise in violence that has touched nearly every aspect of American life. He pointed to attacks on elections officials, airline crews, teachers, journalists, police officers, judges and members of Congress. “These acts and threats of violence are not associated with any one set of partisan or ideological views,” he warned. “But they are permeating so many parts of our national life that they risk becoming normalized and routine if we do not stop them.” The justice department, he promised, would work within the bounds of the first amendment to prosecute all those who made unlawful threats. He also committed the department to using “the enforcement powers we have” to protect voting rights, warning of efforts in some states to audit election results, drive out election officials or allow state lawmakers to overturn the will of voters. “As with violence and threats of violence, the justice department – even the Congress – cannot alone defend the right to vote,” he said. “The responsibility to preserve democracy – and to maintain faith in the legitimacy of its essential processes – lies with every elected official and every American.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/merrick-garland-us-capitol-attack-investigation;1
105;105;5346;5346;Five great reads: a cyclist battles bad driving, interactive self-help and a deeply weird symposium;2022-01-05T23:25:46Z;['Alyx Gorman'];['Australia news', 'Culture', 'Life and style', 'Health & wellbeing', 'World news'];"Hello, good morning, hope we’re all holding up alright, and if not, hopefully this can be a temporary distraction. It’s Five Great Reads, your weekday summertime wrap of hope, joy and great journalism, selected by me – Guardian Australia’s feelings, frocks and fish sauce editor, Alyx Gorman. If you’ve come here for hard news then please let me redirect you to my far more capable pals over at the Morning Mail for a primer on the day ahead; and to our live blog for the day’s events as they unfold. (Psst… Newsletter subscribers, don’t read this part.) This is an article but it’s also an email newsletter you can sign up for, by popping your details right here.
(Okay! Okay you can start reading again!) Today we have reads on self help, cycling and slum influencers, plus the weirdest academic conference you’ve never heard of. Let’s hop to it. 1. The biker taking on dangerous drivers Armed with a GoPro and fuelled by a tragic backstory, Mike van Erp, AKA CyclingMikey, has reported over 1000 dangerous drivers – including Guy Ritchie.
So he’s like Batman on a bike? He really prefers not to be referred to as a vigilante, actually. He’s just very into road safety rules, and doesn’t have to go out of his way to find people who break them. Notable quote: “Most people who cycle realise that bad driving is largely tolerated by society,” van Erp says. “It’s not considered a really serious thing. Yet it’s claiming 1,800 people’s lives a year in the UK alone.” If he thinks London’s bad he should visit Sydney … Indeed. How long will this take me to read? About five minutes. 2. The snapchat ‘slum influencer’ with eyes on politics Nasser Sari’s cheerful snaps of life in one of France’s poorest neighbourhoods has earned him a massive social media following. Now he plans to flex that influence by standing for national assembly. Notable quote: “I want to shatter the cliches,” Sari says. “I’m young, of colour, someone who dares. I want to annoy people a bit. To show France who we are.” Could he win? “Pyrenées-Orientales has about 350,000 registered voters,” Phil Hoad reports. “If only a portion of NasDas’s followers vote for him, he could be Snapchatting from parliament this time next year.” How long will it take me to read? Just under five minutes.
3. Self-help gets interactive No longer niche, everyone from Michelle Obama to James Clear has a guided journal these days. So are they any good? Jenny Valentish road-tests a sample, with mixed results. What is a guided journal? That depends – it can be anything from hardback diaries with cutesy prompts (“What did you dream of last night?” “Draw something that makes you happy”) to workbooks that border on therapy handouts. What are they for? Everything from decluttering to drinking less: goal-setting, productivity and even dismantling privilege (there’s a guided journal edition of Layla Saad’s Me and White Supremacy). I don’t feel like journaling. Then read Elle Hunt seeking expert advice on how to achieve your goals instead. No doodling required. Still too hard. Fine, make some dal. It’s quick, healthy and freezes well. 4. ‘The Land of Milk and Money’ Why did a group of academics hold an online symposium dedicated to the cult 2017 animated film Boss Baby? For the lols, obvs. But maybe also kind of not?
I’ve never seen Boss Baby, why should I read this? Because it’s funny and surprisingly thoughtful – even if you haven’t seen the film. Which I also have not. Yes, but you once used Bourdieu’s concept of habitus as a framework for analysing Gossip Girl in an undergraduate essay. Opht, straight for the jugular. I got an HD for that essay though. 5. Cuba’s Covid-vaccine marvel How a country that still struggles to keep the lights on became one of the world’s most-vaccinated nations.
Cuba is one of the world’s most vaccinated nations? Yep, more than 90% of the population (kids included) have been vaccinated with at least one dose and 83% are fully vaxxed. Oh – and they developed the vaccine themselves. Also: vaccination isn’t mandatory. Notable quote: “Ever since the 1959 revolution, Cubans have embarked on these grand crusades which are quixotic yet often successful,” says Gregory Biniowsky, a Havana-based lawyer. Case in point: Fidel Castro’s vast investment in biotech after the fall of the Soviet Union. “Any rational adviser would have said this was not the time to invest resources in something that might bear fruit in 25 years. And yet here we are now … where these fruits of the biotech investment are saving lives.” How long will it take to read?

106;106;5347;5347;Did Priti Patel cross a line in urging pursuit of the Colston Four?;2022-01-05T22:55:36Z;['Rajeev Syal'];['Bristol', 'Priti Patel', 'Police', 'Statues', 'Keir Starmer', 'UK news', 'Protest', 'Slavery', 'Politics'];"The acquittal of the Colston Four will prompt close scrutiny of the actions of the home secretary, Priti Patel, who became personally involved in ensuring that they were pursued through the criminal justice system. Hours after the statue of the slave trader was toppled on 7 June 2020, Patel appeared on Sky News to demand that police pursue those responsible, saying their behaviour was “utterly disgraceful”. “It is right that the police follow up on that and make sure that justice is taken, undertaken, with those individuals that are responsible for such disorderly and lawless behaviour,” she said. Two days later, it emerged that she had also called Andy Marsh, the chief constable of Avon and Somerset police, to demand an explanation. Her comments and subsequent actions have been queried by close observers. Nazir Afzal, the former chief prosecutor for northwest England, questioned why she appeared to have become so heavily involved in pursuing those involved instead of leaving decisions to police and prosecutors. “We have a tripartite regime for a reason and that is so that politicians do not get involved in the operational decisions taken by the police,” he told the Guardian. “It may be that she has overstepped the boundaries of that arrangement that we have had for nearly 200 years. It is not something that I think she would want to repeat.” Stuart C McDonald, the SNP’s home affairs spokesperson, said the prosecution always appeared uncalled for, ill-considered and a waste of resources. “The home secretary’s meddling was inappropriate, ill-judged and shows how totally out of touch she is,” he said. This is not the first time Patel has faced criticism for involvement in police operations, particularly when it comes to confronting demonstrators. Police sources told the Guardian last year that heavy-handed tactics used at the Sarah Everard vigil followed a meeting at the Home Office where it was made clear the government wanted a pandemic ban on large gatherings to be enforced. Senior officers were told Patel would make a statement saying so – but the statement never came, it was claimed. Whitehall sources said Patel repeatedly criticised local police for not protecting the Colston statue in 2020 or making arrests on the day. The dilemma they faced was explained and justified by the Avon and Somerset force’s Supt Andy Bennett, who was acutely aware of the campaign against the statue and why officers could not be seen to defend it. “[Colston was] a historical figure that’s caused the black community quite a lot of angst over the last couple of years. So while I am disappointed that people … damaged one of our statues, I do understand why it’s happened, it’s very symbolic,” he told the BBC. “We made a very tactical decision that to stop people doing that act may have caused further disorder.”
Labour MPs suspect that ministers have become obsessed with the issue of statues and whether they may be toppled because they are pursuing a “war on woke”. Kerry McCarthy, the MP for Bristol East, said in March: “We know what it is about. It is about stoking up social and cultural anxieties to win votes, seeking out not what we have in common, but what divides us, fanning the flames.” But Labour are facing their own dilemma following the verdict. Keir Starmer sparked unease across the left of his party the day after the Colston statue was toppled by condemning the actions of the protesters. In a clear shift in tone from Jeremy Corbyn’s attitude to civil disobedience, Starmer told LBC radio: “It shouldn’t have been done in that way, [it was] completely wrong to pull a statue down like that. “[But] stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. We can’t, in 21st century Britain, have a slaver on a statue.” As of Wednesday night, neither Patel nor Starmer had released a statement commenting on the verdict.";https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/jan/05/did-priti-patel-cross-a-line-in-urging-pursuit-of-the-colston-four;1
107;107;5348;5348;Britain’s stalling economy blamed on inflation and product shortages;2022-01-05T22:30:45Z;['Phillip Inman'];['Economic growth (GDP)', 'Inflation', 'Interest rates', 'Consumer spending', 'Economic recovery', 'Supply chain crisis', 'Economics', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Business', 'Small business', 'Global economy', 'Retail industry', 'Energy industry', 'Public finance', 'UK news'];Britain’s economic recovery stalled before the arrival of the Omicron variant of Covid and the dampening effect of the government’s plan B restrictions on consumer spending in the Christmas shopping period, a wide-ranging company survey has found. Businesses blamed spiralling inflation and shortages of imported goods for a decline in sales in the fourth quarter, which meant that an expansion during the spring and summer ground to a halt. In a message that will concern the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the British Chambers of Commerce added that many respondents to its quarterly survey of almost 5,500 firms revealed that they were running low on cash and had ditched investment plans to stay afloat into the new year. Suren Thiru, the BCC’s head of economics, said sales growth stalled as firms struggled with the “mounting headwinds” of inflation, a scarcity of skilled workers, and problems sourcing products from overseas. “The persistent weakness in cash flow is troubling because it leaves businesses more exposed to the economic impact of Omicron, rising inflation and potential further restrictions,” he said. The survey also found that the prospect of Bank of England officials raising interest rates was another concern for firms that had taken on extra debt over the last 20 months to cope with the pandemic. The bank raised rates to 0.25% in December. A series of reports have shown the UK economy heading into a challenging spring, with a strong rise in consumer prices hitting household disposable incomes and denting consumer confidence. Official figures showed the consumer prices index (CPI) jumped to 5.1% in November following persistent increases in oil and gas prices and other commodities, including wheat and copper. Consumer spending has underpinned the recovery, accounting for more than 80% of the UK’s growth, while spending on government services such as the NHS has made up much of the difference. Only a minority of businesses have pushed ahead with spending on new equipment, buildings and machinery, despite the offer of tax subsidies on investment, made in the budget last March. In the second quarter of 2021 GDP growth hit 5.5%, but fell back to 1.3% in the third quarter. The BCC survey, which was conducted in the last week of November, indicated that the economy was on course to flatline in the fourth quarter. It was likely the economy would contract in the first months of this year as the message to work from home and avoid large gatherings affected sales, Thiru said. Thiru added: “The UK economy is starting 2022 facing some key challenges. The renewed reluctance among consumers to spend and staff shortages triggered by Omicron and plan B may mean that the UK economy contracts in the near term, particularly if more restrictions are needed. “Rising inflation is likely to limit UK’s growth prospects this year by eroding consumers’ spending power and squeezing firms’ profit margins and their ability to invest. The notable uptick in concerns over higher interest rates underscores the need for the Bank of England to proceed with caution on further rate rises to avoid undermining confidence and an already fragile recovery.” A separate survey by the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (Cips) found that 85% of the 228 firms questioned experienced supply chain disruption last year. A quarter of the firms said suppliers shutting down due to Covid restrictions caused them the most acute supply shortages. The majority (71%) of those experiencing disruption and shortages expected it to last for six months or more, while more than a third said shortages would persist into 2023. The Institute of Directors said its economic confidence index had tumbled from -6 in November to -17 this month, a sign of nervousness among business owners about the UK’s economic prospects. It said three-quarters of company directors expected costs to rise in the next 12 months, and most said they would raise prices to either fully or partially offset the rise in costs. A snapshot of the UK’s manufacturing sector in December showed supply chain disruption and staff shortages continued to hold back growth. The IHS Markit/Cips survey showed growth in UK factory output was limited last month by Covid restrictions and Brexit weighing on orders and pushing up costs. Inflows of new work from overseas dropped for the fourth month in a row. The BCC director general, Shevaun Haviland, said: “Supply chain disruption is continuing to persist, inflation is soaring, and rising energy costs are presenting firms with a huge headache. “With companies now having to grapple with the impact of Omicron and further changes to the rules on imports and exports of goods to the EU, there are significant hurdles for businesses in the months ahead.”;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/britains-stalling-economy-blamed-on-inflation-and-product-shortages;2
108;108;5349;5349;Mandy review – slap my bum and call me a satanist! Diane Morgan is back;2022-01-05T22:30:45Z;['Stuart Jeffries'];['Diane Morgan', 'Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'BBC'];There is an intern inside Diane Morgan’s beehive. The person, after being shrunk to fit, operates a tiny control panel to create Morgan’s facial expressions. The only problem is that they are not very good at it. Perhaps the hairspray Morgan wears for her role in Mandy (BBC Two) has clouded the intern’s brain. They keep pulling on the lever that twitches her pursed lips into a lop-sided smirk, or using the rotator ball to make her Marty Feldman-like eyes swivel in a parody of human sarcasm. Or at least, this is my explanation for why Morgan’s performance as the titular mardy, functionally unemployable Lancastrian tends towards the two-dimensional. It not only accounts for why Mandy is obsessively focused on keeping her hairdo in place. It also explains why there is not the remotest hint that Mandy’s character will develop. She looks like a homage to Coronation Street’s Bet Lynch, with her heels and hatchet glares, but has none of Bet’s rounded humanity or narrative arc. She more closely resembles other Lancastrian comic ciphers such as Twinkle in Dinnerladies (played by Morgan’s friend and fellow Boltonian Maxine Peake), who was forever subverting her boss’s patriarchal mind games with lines including: “All right, keep your scrotum on.” Or Caroline Aherne’s checkout girl in The Fast Show, deriding shoppers’ purchases: “Parmesan cheese? Smells like a tramp’s crotch.” The twist here is that Mandy is neither an ancillary character nor delivering a gag in a weekly sketch, but rather intended to carry the series. You might think that Morgan’s character should seem to involve more than being manipulated from within her hair by a tiny, undertrained intern. But that is to miss the magnificence of Mandy. In a sense, this is a revolutionary sitcom, dedicated to the philosophy that people don’t really change and that richly developed narratives aren’t all that. There is an episode of Seinfeld in which Kramer test-drives a car to see how far he can go without putting in more gas. Mandy is like that: how far can she go with zero character development and only the most threadbare storylines? Not as far as season three, I would guess, but I have been wrong before. In this episode, the season two premiere, Mandy is sent by jobcentre lackeys to work at a stately home. Her previous jobs all ended in disaster: there were fatalities after she ineptly processed fruit at a banana plant, and she saw an alien in the aisles while working in Co-op, where she racked up a £79 bill for edam after wilfully misinterpreting the staff discount. At Brampton Hall, Mandy dresses as a scullery maid and takes visitors on tours exploring the house’s past. “This is the room where John the Baptist died,” she explains to sceptical couples in jumpers. It is as if Lucy Worsley turned up for a TV documentary gig in period costume but knew nothing about history and decided brazenly to invent nonsensical claims on the fly, staring dead-eyed at anyone who doubted her. Offered folding money by some dimwit tourist, she reveals more of the house’s history: “Ronnie and Reggie used to live here, but were killed because they stole Michael Heseltine’s ashtray.” Mandy, then, is the soul sister of Philomena Cunk, the gormless know-nothing pundit created by Charlie Brooker and performed by Morgan. She is also closely related to Liz – whom Morgan plays in Motherland – a woman heroically scathing about the middle-class pieties of child rearing. Later, Mandy is tasked with serving nibbles at a book reading in the hall, but she takes the vol-au-vent tray to the wrong room and finds herself among satanists conducting a black mass. That furious clattering noise you can hear is National Trust and English Heritage press officers typing statements distancing themselves from Brampton Hall’s employment practices and room-hire policies. Long story short, Mandy is strapped to an altar by masked yet unacceptably naked satanists and rescued only when Lola, her designated-driver mate, shows up. “What the devil is going on here?” Lola exclaims. “My badminton got cancelled,” says one devil worshipper. Then Lola smacks the men’s bare buttocks (the biggest laugh of the episode, in my book) and chases them off. Why satanic ritual requires nudity is beyond me. The episode ends with two revelations. The first I won’t disclose, but if you can’t guess the identity of at least one satanist, you are too dim to be watching Mandy. The second is more astounding. According to the credits, the show was written and directed by Morgan – not by a homunculus inside a hairdo. I would never have guessed.;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/05/mandy-review-slap-my-bum-and-call-me-a-satanist-diane-morgan-is-back;5
109;109;5350;5350;Italy makes Covid vaccinations compulsory for over-50s;2022-01-05T22:29:50Z;['Angela Giuffrida'];['Coronavirus', 'Italy', 'World news', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Europe'];"Italy has made it obligatory for people aged 50 or more to be vaccinated against Covid-19 as the country scrambles to ease pressure on hospitals and reduce deaths amid a dramatic surge in infections. The measure is among the toughest vaccine mandates in Europe and takes effect immediately. The move was unanimously supported by ministers despite divisions between the parties that make up prime minister Mario Draghi’s broad coalition before the cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Italy also tightened its workplace vaccine rules and from 15 February, people aged over 50 who are in jobs, either in the public or private sector, will have to present a health pass proving immunisation or recovery from Covid-19.
Hospitals are under increasing pressure because of the Omicron variant. Italy registered 189,109 new infections on Wednesday and 231 fatalities, bringing the death toll to 138,276, the highest in Europe after the UK. Health minister Roberto Speranza said that two-thirds of Covid-19 patients in intensive care units were unvaccinated, as were 50% of the patients being treated in ordinary wards. “We are making these choices in order to restrict the unvaccinated as much as possible, as this is what is causing the burden on our hospital system,” Speranza told the Italian media after the cabinet meeting. Business leaders had urged the government to make the vaccine mandatory for all workers over fears that the latest wave of the pandemic could slow down the economy. Draghi had sought to toughen up the vaccine mandate last week, but the cabinet failed to agree on a measure and so the talks were postponed. “We want to slow the growth of the infection curve and push Italians who are not yet vaccinated to get vaccinated,” Draghi said at the start of the cabinet meeting, according to the news agency Ansa. “We are targeting the age groups which are most at risk of hospitalisation in order to reduce pressure on hospitals and save lives. At the same time, we want to keep schools and businesses open.” Obligatory vaccines were already in place for health workers, teachers and the police. Austria is making vaccines obligatory for the over-14s from February, while Germany is planning to introduce a vaccine mandate for adults. Italy’s latest move follows the tightening of measures regarding the so-called super green pass last week. From Monday, people will no longer be able to dine in or outside a restaurant, go to the gym or use public transport unless they can prove immunisation or recovery from Covid.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/italy-makes-covid-vaccinations-compulsory-for-over-50s;7
110;110;5351;5351;Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers call for a retrial following juror’s interview;2022-01-05T22:29:39Z;['Victoria Bekiempis'];['Ghislaine Maxwell', 'US news', 'Law (US)'];"Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell have called for a retrial after a juror said in recent post-trial media interviews that he was a victim of sexual abuse.
Maxwell was found guilty on 29 December of five counts for facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of girls, some as young as 14. Prosecutors have also asked judge Alison Nathan to investigate the juror’s remarks. “While the court instructed jurors that they were free to discuss their jury service with anyone of their choosing, some of the statements, as related in the media, merit attention by the court. In particular, the juror has described being a victim of sexual abuse,” prosecutors wrote. “Assuming the accuracy of the reporting, the juror asserted that he ‘flew through’ the prospective juror questionnaire and does not recall being asked whether he had been a victim of sexual abuse, but stated that ‘he would have answered honestly’. “Based on the foregoing, the government believes the court should conduct an inquiry,” they wrote to Nathan. The juror’s claim that he did not recall being asked about sexual abuse has spurred questions, given that prospective jurors were given a questionnaire which directly asked them this topic. One inquiry on the questionnaire stated: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” Another asked: “Witnesses in this case may testify claiming sexual abuse or sexual assault. Would you have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like you would any other witness?” In their letter, prosecutors proposed Judge Nathan schedule a hearing in about a month, as well as a schedule for filing paperwork relating to this inquiry. “Government respectfully submits that any juror investigation should be conducted exclusively under the supervision of the court,” they wrote. “If the court decides to schedule such a hearing, the government respectfully requests that the court’s staff promptly contact the juror to notify him of the hearing and inquire whether he would like counsel to be appointed in connection with it.” One of Maxwell’s lawyers, Christian Everdell, filed a letter about the juror’s comments several hours after prosecutors’ submission, describing it as “an issue of pressing importance”. While this filing had some redactions, one visible phrase said “presents incontrovertible grounds for a new trial under rule 33”. Everdell asked Nathan to set a schedule for both sides to submit filings on the issue. “Should the defense prevail on this motion – and we believe the law and facts are clearly on our side – it would render all other post-trial motions moot. Ms Maxwell should not have to expend precious time and resources briefing other motions when this motion can and should be dispositive,” Everdell said. “Accordingly, the defense respectfully requests that the court set a briefing schedule for this motion alone and defer setting a briefing schedule for any other post-trial motions.” Jeffrey Pagliuca, another one of Maxwell’s lawyers, said in a filing shortly thereafter that “the government’s request for a hearing is premature because based on undisputed, publicly available information, the Court can and should order a new trial without any evidentiary hearing. “It is clear to Ms Maxwell that based on this record alone a new trial is required,” Pagliuca also wrote. David S Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at Jones Walker LLP, said: “Based on the letter motion that was filed today by the government, it’s clear that they want to ensure that it’s the court who conducts any questioning of this juror.” He said: “They want to put the court on notice that this information is out there and they want to prevent any other third party from speaking to this juror before the court does” – including Maxwell’s defense team. At issue will be what the juror said on his questionnaire. If he answered no, the motivation behind that answer could influence the outcome of any inquiry. For example, if he answered no because he was not paying attention, that might present less of a problem than if he knowingly answered in the negative to avoid being disqualified. “If it turned out he checked the box yes, and both the defense and prosecution never bothered to follow up on it, that’s on them,” Weinstein said. Weinstein said that the process would involve Nathan questioning the juror. Then, Nathan will provide the information from this questioning to both sides. “If the answers are ‘I misled you because I wanted to serve’, then that’s going to provide the defense a basis to push their side forward,” he explained. “It’s certainly going to prolong things. It’s going to provide more motion practice, it’s going to potentially delay the sentencing.” The outcome will rest on Nathan, Weinstein said. “She can decide whether or not it’s going to be a new trial, or she could deny [any] motion for a new trial, and then it will become an issue for the court of appeals whether or not that was an error.” “This could be a huge blow to the prosecution if this juror did in fact fail to provide such information,” New York criminal defense attorney Julie Rendelman told the Guardian. “Keep in mind that this juror suggests that his own experience as a victim of sexual abuse not only impacted his decision making but others in the jury who he relayed his story to.” Late Wednesday afternoon, the New York Times revealed that another juror had told their fellow panelists that they had been sexually abused. This juror told The Times that their disclosure seemed to aid in shaping deliberations.

111;111;5352;5352;Absurd Tottenham mistakes deflect spotlight away from Romelu Lukaku | Jacob Steinberg;2022-01-05T22:25:08Z;['Jacob Steinberg'];['Carabao Cup', 'Chelsea', 'Tottenham Hotspur', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Romelu Lukaku'];"You have to hand it to Tottenham defenders. Whatever their faults, at least nobody can doubt their entertainment value. After all they even managed to pull off the impossible during the first leg of this Carabao Cup semi-final, somehow dragging the spotlight away from Chelsea’s extremely apologetic record signing with a performance of spectacular slapstick at the back. This must have been a form of rare torture for Antonio Conte. Even with Romelu Lukaku straining for touch and composure, Chelsea were dominant after welcoming their former manager back to Stamford Bridge for the first time. Thomas Tuchel had come up trumps after being forced to tweak his system and Conte cut a glum figure as half-time approached, his mood hardly helped by the farcical own goal that eased Chelsea into a 2-0 lead after 34 minutes of one‑way traffic.
It had been wretched from Spurs, who were dismal without Eric Dier and Cristian Romero at the back. Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Oliver Skipp were being pulled all over the place in central midfield, the movement of Mason Mount and Hakim Ziyech a constant problem, and the vulnerabilities at the back were evident even before Kai Havertz fired Chelsea ahead in the fifth minute. The gaps had appeared from Chelsea’s first attack. Lukaku, back in the side after annoying Tuchel by accidentally pledging his undying love to Internazionale, had something to prove. The time for talking was over and the £97.5m forward was involved in the first minute, tearing down the right flank before letting Spurs off the hook with a poor cross. Still, it was a moment of promise for Chelsea. Always creative, Tuchel had a solution after the absence of Reece James, Ben Chilwell, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah was compounded by Thiago Silva and N’Golo Kanté testing positive for Covid-19. The German had not veered away from a back three all season but he adjusted here, paying homage to Ralf Rangnick by switching to a 4‑2‑2‑2, a change that gave Lukaku more support and left Spurs all at sea. Conte, who got the best out of Lukaku when he managed him at Inter, had not seen it coming. With Jorginho and Saúl Ñíguez assured in midfield for Chelsea, Spurs had no way out and they looked nervy with Havertz under instructions to play near Lukaku during the early stages.
The curiosity of that move from Tuchel is that Lukaku – who describes himself as a “multidimensional” forward – has often looked isolated this season. The Belgian has pined for his partnership with Lautaro Martínez, his former Inter teammate, and has struggled to live up to expectations since returning to Stamford Bridge. Tuchel, however, has repeatedly rejected suggestions that he has changed his system since signing Lukaku; as the German has pointed out, sharp-eyed observers will have noticed Chelsea used a 3‑4‑2‑1 when they won the Champions League last season.
Nonetheless this was no time to be rigid. Tuchel had only four fit senior defenders – in came the lesser spotted Malang Sarr to partner Antonio Rüdiger in central defence – so it made sense to bolster his attack by using Ziyech and Mount as roving No 10s. Spurs, arranged in a staid 3-4-3, were confused. After five minutes Japhet Tanganga tried to play out from the back. The pass was too short and Marcos Alonso quickly stole in front of Emerson Royal before slipping in Havertz, who beat Hugo Lloris with the aid of a deflection off Davinson Sánchez. At that point it was worth remembering Lukaku is not the only expensive Chelsea forward who has struggled to fire under Tuchel. After all, what is Havertz’s best position? Is he a target man? A No 10? A false nine? And just when will the £62m German build on his winner in the Champions League final to produce a consistent run of form? Perhaps this, a goal against Chelsea’s fiercest rivals, will be a moment of ignition for Havertz. He was excellent before going off at half-time, troubling Spurs by drifting to the left to combine with Mount and Alonso, and he could have scored again after another wretched mix-up from Conte’s side.
Spurs could barely put a foot right. Harry Kane was barely allowed a sniff by Rüdiger and although Lukaku toiled at times, his difficulties encapsulated by the moment when he ran the ball out for a throw and tripped over his own feet, Chelsea were always on top. A second goal felt inevitable and it arrived when Ziyech’s inswinging free-kick led to more comedy, Tanganga’s attempted headed clearance bouncing off Ben Davies and flying past Lloris. There was no way back for Spurs from there. Lukaku could have increased their pain when he headed wide and, although Spurs improved after the break, Chelsea are in control before the second leg next week. It is up to Conte to find the answers.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/05/absurd-tottenham-mistakes-deflect-spotlight-away-from-romelu-lukaku;4
112;112;5353;5353;Kazakhstan protests: Moscow-led alliance sends ‘peacekeeping forces’;2022-01-05T22:13:15Z;['Shaun Walker', 'Naubet Bisenov'];['Kazakhstan', 'Russia', 'Protest', 'World news', 'Europe', 'South and central Asia'];"“Peacekeeping forces” from a Russia-led military alliance will be sent to Kazakhstan to help the country’s president regain control, it was announced on Wednesday night, as violent clashes continued after fuel price rises triggered widespread protests. Armenia’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, said the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) – an alliance of Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan – would dispatch forces to “stabilise” the Central Asian country. The announcement came after Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, appealed to the bloc for help, decrying the actions of “terrorists” and alleging the country had been the victim of “attacks” by foreign-trained gangs. On Wednesday, demonstrators took over government buildings and reportedly stormed the airport in Almaty, the country’s commercial capital and largest city. “Almaty was attacked, destroyed, vandalised, the residents of Almaty became victims of attacks by terrorists, bandits, therefore it is our duty … to take all possible actions to protect our state,” said Tokayev, in his second televised address in a matter of hours. The Kazakh events come at a time when all eyes have been on a possible Russian intervention in Ukraine. Images of police being overpowered by protesters are likely to cause alarm in Moscow, as another country neighbouring Russia succumbs to political unrest. Kazakhstan is part of an economic union with Russia and the two countries share a long border. It was not clear how many troops the CSTO would send and how long they would stay in the country. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, but Russian MP Leonid Kalashnikov told Interfax that the troops would stay “for as long as the president of Kazakhstan believes it necessary”. He said they would mainly be engaged in protecting “infrastructure” in the country. The announcement came just hours after Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, said it was important no foreign countries interfered in Kazakhstan. Earlier in the evening, Tokayev spoke to the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, who crushed a huge uprising with brutal force in 2019. Before calling Tokayev, Lukashenko spoke to Putin, the Belarusian news agency Belta reported. The protests began in the west of the country at the weekend, after a sharp rise in fuel prices, but have spread quickly and taken Kazakhstan’s authorities and international observers by surprise. On Wednesday, there were further reports of violent clashes and shooting in Almaty and other cities, as well as unverified videos suggesting casualties among protesters. Kazakh media outlets cited the interior ministry as saying 317 police and national guard servicemen were injured and eight killed “by the hands of a raging crowd”. There have been no reliable estimates of civilian casualties. Earlier in the day, the Almaty mayor’s office was set on fire, with smoke and flames visible from several floors of the imposing building. Many flights were diverted or cancelled after the apparent storming of the airport. Kazakh media outlets reported authorities took the airport back under control after a firefight. In other cities, including Aktobe in the west of the country, crowds tried to storm government buildings. There were reports and videos of police cars set on fire and security vehicles seized by the crowd.
Tokayev accepted the resignation of the government on Wednesday morning and introduced a state of emergency in several provinces in an attempt to gain control of the situation. Later, the state of emergency was extended to the entire country. Tokayev also announced that his predecessor and benefactor, 81-year-old Nursultan Nazarbayev, would step down as head of the security council. Much of the anger has been directed at Nazarbayev, a former Soviet-era communist boss who became Kazakhstan’s first president and ruled until 2019 and who wielded immense power behind the scenes. “The authorities are trying everything to calm things down, with a mix of promises and threats, but so far it’s not working,” said Dosym Satpayev, an Almaty-based political analyst. “There will be imitations of dialogue but essentially the regime will respond with force, because they have no other tools.”
At times, authorities have shut down mobile internet and blocked access to messaging apps, and on Wednesday the internet went down across much of Kazakhstan. Authorities said army units had been brought into Almaty to restore order. The trigger for protests in Kazakhstan was a sharp rise in the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), used by many to power their cars, particularly in the west of the country. Protests began at the weekend in the oil city of Zhanaozen, where in December 2011 police fired on protesters, killing at least 16 people.
It soon became clear that the anger was not focused only on LPG prices, and a government announcement that the price would be fixed at a lower level has done nothing to quell the protest. Instead, there is broader discontent with Tokayev, president since 2019, and Nazarbayev. “Nazarbayev and his family have monopolised all sectors, from banking to roads to gas. These protests are about corruption,” said 55-year-old Zauresh Shekenova, who has been protesting in Zhanaozen since Sunday. “It all started with the increase in gas prices but the real cause of the protests is poor living conditions of people, high prices, joblessness, corruption.” Darkhan Sharipov, an activist from the civil society movement Wake Up, Kazakhstan, said: “People are sick of corruption and nepotism, and the authorities don’t listen to people … We want President Tokayev to carry out real political reforms, or to go away and hold fair elections.” The five former Soviet Central Asian republics have been largely without protest in their three decades of independence, with the exception of Kyrgyzstan, which has had several revolutions. Kazakhstan has never held an election judged as free and fair by international observers. While it is clear there is widespread discontent, the cleansing of the political playing field over many years means there are no high-profile opposition figures around which a protest movement could unite, and the protests appear largely directionless. “There are some local figures, but nobody who could unify forces across the country, though with time they could appear,” said Satpayev.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/kazakhstan-protests-president-threatens-ruthless-crackdown;1
113;113;5354;5354;Novak Djokovic’s Australian Open hopes dashed after visa cancelled at airport;2022-01-05T22:10:49Z;['Tumaini Carayol'];['Australian Open 2022', 'Novak Djokovic', 'Australian Open', 'Tennis', 'Coronavirus', 'Australia sport', 'Sport', 'Australia news'];"Novak Djokovic’s attempts to compete at the Australian Open this month have collapsed after the No 1-ranked male tennis player was told his visa has been rejected. He is due to be flown out of Melbourne on Thursday amid a spiralling outcry over a controversial “medical exemption” agreed by the tournament’s organisers. The reigning Australian Open champion was held up for several hours at passport control on Wednesday night at Tullamarine airport in Melbourne, the host city of the tournament, as he was questioned.
The Australian Border Force confirmed on Thursday morning he would not be allowed to remain in the country.
“The ABF will continue to ensure that those who arrive at our border comply with our laws and entry requirements,” a statement read. “The ABF can confirm that Mr Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently cancelled. “Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa cancelled will be detained and removed from Australia. The ABF can confirm Mr Djokovic had access to his phone.” There are reports Djokovic’s lawyers will challenge the decision. Djokovic’s father Srdjan said the player was moved to a room alone, separated from his team. More than five hours after they arrived in Melbourne, Goran Ivanisevic, Djokovic’s coach, posted a selfie on Instagram from the airport at 5am captioned “not the most usual trip Down Under”. The Victoria state government said it had refused to formally support Djokovic’s visa application and it was reported that the visa with which he attempted to enter Australia does not allow for exemptions for unvaccinated applicants. The exact grounds for Djokovic’s initial exemption were unclear, although his opposition to vaccination is well known, fuelling the criticism inside Melbourne, Victoria and across Australia. Djokovic is seeking to win his 21st grand slam singles title, overtaking Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, at the tournament beginning on 17 January. On Wednesday Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, added his voice to the furore, saying Djokovic would be “on the next plane home” if he was unable to provide proof of his medical exemption. “If that evidence is insufficient, then he won’t be treated any different to anyone else and he’ll be on the next plane home. There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever.”
Victorian officials were asked by the federal authorities to formally support Djokovic’s visa application, which led Jaala Pulford, the state’s acting sports minister, to announce on Twitter that the state would not be doing so. “The federal government has asked if we will support Novak Djokovic’s visa application to enter Australia,” Pulford said. “We will not be providing Novak Djokovic with individual visa application support to participate in the 2022 Australian Open grand slam [tournament]. We’ve always been clear on two points: visa approvals are a matter for the federal government, and medical exemptions are a matter for doctors.”
Djokovic announced on Tuesday that he would be flying to Australia after receiving an “exemption permission”, rather than vaccinating himself against Covid, immediately prompting backlash from the Australian public and politicians. As the nine-times Australian Open champion embarked on his journey to Melbourne, criticism of him hardened. Karen Andrews, the federal home affairs minister, released a statement suggesting the federal government could revoke Djokovic’s exemption unless he provided “acceptable proof” of the reasons for his medical exemption at the border. “Any individual seeking to enter Australia must comply with our strict border requirements,” Andrews wrote. “While the Victorian government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border.”
Victorians have endured lengthy lockdowns and there is significant anxiety about rising Covid cases as Australia struggles with the Omicron surge. On Wednesday Victoria recorded a record 17,636 new cases and a rise in hospitalisations, prompting non-urgent elective surgeries to be reduced. Additionally, Morrison’s government is under fire for its handling of Covid and his refusal to make basic provisions free or affordable. Simple lateral flow tests are sold out at supermarkets and pharmacies across the city, most available are sold for around A$30 (£16) and others have been subject to price gouging from some companies. The Australian tennis legend Rod Laver said in an interview with the Herald Sun that Djokovic should reveal the reason he was granted a medical exemption. “If he’s got a reason for [the exemption] then … we should know it,” Laver said. “Yes, you’re a great player and you’ve performed and won so many tournaments, so, it can’t be physical. So what is the problem?”
Djokovic’s fellow world No 1, Ashleigh Barty, was asked about Djokovic after her opening match of the season in Adelaide. Barty noted the difficulties faced in Victoria but she declined to wade into the debate around Djokovic. “I know how hard it has been for Australians all around our nation, but in particular Victorians have had a real rough trot over the last 18 months and two years,” Barty said. “I understand why they may be frustrated with the decision. Ultimately I have no interest in speaking about Novak’s medical history. It’s not my decision. Those decisions are made. They’re completely out of my control.” Shortly after Djokovic announced his “exemption permission”, Tennis Australia clarified that Djokovic had been granted a medical exemption and that his application was reviewed by two separate independent medical panels, firstly from Tennis Australia and then provided by the Victorian government. The personal information of each applicant was redacted. Craig Tiley, the Tennis Australia chief executive, revealed 26 tennis players and support staff had applied for exemptions with only a handful receiving them.
On Wednesday Tiley continued to emphasise the robustness of the process that led to Djokovic receiving an exception but he acknowledged the public’s frustrations. “Some of you will be upset about the fact that Novak has come in because of his statements of the past couple of years around vaccination,” Tiley said. “However, it’s ultimately up to him to discuss with the public his condition if you choose to do that, and the reason why he received an exemption. We as an event, also as a state, as a country, will do everything we possibly can to give everyone an equal opportunity to come into the country.” Last year Djokovic said he was “opposed to vaccination” and added: “I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel … But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/novak-djokovics-australian-open-participation-in-doubt-over-visa-row;4
114;114;5355;5355;Jon Stewart denies claims he accused JK Rowling of antisemitism;2022-01-05T21:58:45Z;['N/A'];['JK Rowling', 'Antisemitism', 'Harry Potter', 'UK news'];Former US talkshow host Jon Stewart says comments he made about the Harry Potter films were meant to be “lighthearted” and he was not accusing author JK Rowling of antisemitism. The comedian said news outlets had “piled into this ridiculously out of context nonsense”, and he did not want the franchise censored “in any way”. It comes after a clip emerged of Stewart discussing scenes from the film set in the magical bank Gringotts, run by goblins, on the podcast The Problem with Jon Stewart. In it, Stewart made comparisons between caricatures from antisemitic literature and the “folks that run the bank”. Speaking in a video posted on Twitter, he said: “There is no reasonable person that could have watched it and not seen it as a lighthearted conversation amongst colleagues and chums. “Having a laugh, enjoying ourselves about Harry Potter and my experience watching for the first time in the theatre as a Jewish guy and how some tropes are so embedded in society that they’re basically invisible even in a considered process like movie-making. “This morning I wake up, it’s trending on Twitter, and here’s the headline … ‘Jon Stewart accuses JK Rowling of antisemitism.’” He added: “So let me just say this super clearly, as clearly as I can. “Hello, my name is Jon Stewart. I do not think JK Rowling is antisemitic. “I do not think the Harry Potter movies are antisemitic. “I really love the Harry Potter movies, probably too much for a gentleman of my considerable age. “I cannot stress this enough – I am not accusing JK Rowling of being antisemitic. She need not answer to any of it. “I don’t want the Harry Potter movies censored in any way. It was a lighthearted conversation.” Representatives for Rowling said the author would not be commenting on Stewart’s remarks. In her world-famous books, the goblins that run Gringott’s Bank are depicted as ill-tempered, diminutive creatures who are the guardians of the gold. The first book describes one as “about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard, and Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet”. This article was published after Jon Stewart clarified that his comments about the Harry Potter films were light-hearted and he was not accusing J K Rowling of anti-semitism. It replaces an earlier version, also published on 5 January 2021, that reported on the comments in his podcast.;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/06/jon-stewart-denies-claims-he-accused-jk-rowling-of-antisemitism;5
115;115;5356;5356;Kai Havertz and slapstick Tottenham defending give Chelsea first-leg victory;2022-01-05T21:53:35Z;['David Hytner'];['Carabao Cup', 'Chelsea', 'Tottenham Hotspur', 'Football', 'Sport'];"It was not how Antonio Conte had envisaged his return to Chelsea, the club where he enjoyed such success for two seasons before everything went bang, his departure in 2018 marked by acrimony and a long-running legal case. Results had generally been impressive for Conte on the domestic front since his arrival at Tottenham in early November but this was quite the unravelling, the only consolation being that his team are still just about alive ahead of the second leg of this Carabao Cup semi-final.
Spurs’s defending in the first half was almost impossibly bad. If Kai Havertz’s early opener owed much to their looseness, the second was entirely down to it, Japhet Tanganga’s attempted clearing header from a Hakim Ziyech free-kick smacking into Ben Davies and flying in for a darkly comic own goal. There was no Chelsea player in the vicinity. It was not the only time that Spurs were a danger to themselves, players getting in the way of each other, coherence sorely lacking. Almost implausibly, they came close to burgling a late goal when the substitute, Bryan Gil, showed off his quick feet and cut back for another replacement, Giovani Lo Celso, whose shot was pushed out by Kepa Arrizabalaga. Tanguy Ndombele, who also came off the bench, could not force home the rebound. It was difficult to remember Spurs doing much else as an attacking force. Harry Kane and Son Heung-min were entirely peripheral. The story was one of Chelsea profligacy, with Romelu Lukaku among the guilty. Thomas Tuchel had restored the striker to the starting XI after the fallout from his controversial interview and he struggled to make an impression; his finishing was rushed, his moves a little predictable. It was almost as if he was trying too hard at times.
Lukaku, who was given a muted reception by the home support, was not the only Chelsea player to fluff his lines in front of goal. Havertz, the otherwise excellent Ziyech and the substitute, Timo Werner, all missed gilt-edged chances. Conte, who was without Eric Dier because of a positive Covid test, would pour out his heart afterwards, talking about how far Spurs have come to lag behind teams like Chelsea. They were a long way off them after the first whistle blew, the drive belonging to the hosts, and Havertz’s goal came after Tanganga had played Emerson Royal into trouble. Marcos Alonso stepped up to win the ball, played Havertz in behind Tanganga and the finish went in off Davinson Sánchez. Havertz dislocated his finger in the act of scoring – in gruesome fashion – and, although he made it to half-time, he did not reappear thereafter. Tuchel had been able to call upon only four defenders – Thiago Silva was the latest absentee with Covid (the virus also ruled out a midfielder, N’Golo Kanté) – which is a bit of a problem when his preferred system involves playing a five. He switched with the minimum of fuss to 4-2-2-2.
It was Spurs in their regular 3-4-2-1 formation who looked like strangers during the first half, which was summed up for them by the own goal. Conte stood motionless on the touchline, silently stewing, because it had not been a lone moment of slapstick defending from his team. Havertz had earlier blown a clear chance for 2-0 after Pierre-Emile Højbjerg hit Oliver Skipp with a clearance and the ball broke for the Chelsea attacker. It was no exaggeration to say that the tie could have been over at half-time. Chelsea had pot shots from around the area, with Mason Mount seeing two charged down but it should have been 3-0 in the 41st minute when Ziyech drifted over a cross for Lukaku, who had got in front of Sánchez. The Belgian rose and glanced a header just past the post.
Conte was spoilt for choice in terms of who to remove at the interval but limited himself to only one change – hooking Matt Doherty, who had laboured out of position at left wing-back, and introducing Ndombele. The eye-catching move was the switch to 4-2-3-1. Tuchel was not the only manager to break his religion of three centre-halves. Spurs were a bit better. They took up higher starting positions, which they had failed to do in the first half when Højbjerg and Skipp were worried about Ziyech and Mount getting in between the lines and the team sunk back. They pieced together a few passing moves and Kane extended Arrizabalaga from a free-kick after Ndombele had been fouled by Malang Sarr. But it was Chelsea who continued to look the more threatening. Ziyech sidefooted straight at Lloris after a nice Lukaku pass while he would later volley high; Werner curled past the far post and also watched Lloris save his lob after Ziyech’s defence-splitting pass. And, at the very last, Lukaku shot weakly at Lloris.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/chelsea-tottenham-carabao-cup-semi-final-first-leg-match-report;4
116;116;5357;5357;‘Covid is affecting all of acute care – so the system sludges up’;2022-01-05T21:13:31Z;['N/A'];['Coronavirus', 'Hospitals', 'NHS', 'Doctors', 'Health', 'Infectious diseases', 'UK news'];“Hospitals in the north of England are incredibly busy now, in particular because of Omicron. At the hospital where I work we’ve gone from 26 Covid inpatients on Boxing Day to 104 now. Unlike previous waves of Covid, only four people are being cared for in ICU, whereas in previous waves we were maxed out at 20 people in ICU. That’s good from the patients’ point of view. But it does stress the rest of the system, including the bit of the system I work in – acute medicine. That’s because the system sort of sludges up because of the infection control procedures we have to operate to keep patients safe, and keep Covid and non-Covid patients separated. Those are particularly necessary just now, given how easily Omicron is spread. Covid patients need to be kept in single rooms as far as possible or isolated in areas for them, which can reduce the number of beds for other patients to go into. Do we have enough single rooms for them all? No, not at all. And if a non-Covid inpatient in a four-bedded bay tests positive for it then you can lose the other three beds, because segregation is so important. If there aren’t enough beds for other patients then you cannot get patients in to have an elective procedure, because urgent patients have filled up the elective beds. That means that we can’t get as many patients in for elective procedures as we would like. The numbers of patients we are treating now – both Covid and non-Covid – is quite incredible. Our acute medicine team is staffed to look after 45 patients but this morning we had 62. Ten of those 62 have got Covid and the others have a mixture of all the medical conditions that land people in hospital – pneumonias, strokes, heart attacks, liver disease. My colleagues on the respiratory wards are the same. They’re staffed for 45 and have got 58. Covid is affecting all the acute specialties. We’ve got more non-Covid patients than we’ve ever been looking at before in the first week of January, and we’ve got Covid on top of that. It’s not the worst year ever, but it’s on a par with that. This is my fourth wave of Covid. Staff are mentally tired from making so many decisions all the time without a break. But this time myself and colleagues aren’t thinking ‘here we go again’. It’s more ‘we have to do this, we will look after these people, it’s something we have to do’. No one’s happy. No one’s enjoying it. But it’s sort of heads down and do our utmost for these people. You do always feel a bit of anxiety, though, coming in every morning to see how many patients are waiting for you in A&E, who haven’t got a bed. How long have they been there? Omicron-driven staff sickness is not affecting my hospital too badly. We’ve had some junior doctors off, but only a few consultants, and nursing-wise we are coping. But I know that parts of other hospitals in the north have been really ravaged, decimated, because of horrendous staff shortages. You know an NHS trust is in trouble when they’re sending out group texts saying ‘can anybody come in and do a few hours?’ Loads of NHS staff up and down the country will be getting those messages now from their workforce department. They are messages to doctors and nurses saying basically ‘please can anyone spare a few hours to come in and help?’ They’re seeking help in all the frontline departments – A&E, medical admissions, surgical admission and respiratory medicine. They’re the ones that are really busy and need extra staff. Are people answering the call? Mostly people are now just too tired. Some answer and do come in. Maybe they’ve got a few days off and choose to come in, at whatever risk to themselves. But I talk to people who say: ‘Yeah, I got the text, but I’m just too tired. My choice is either doing the extra hours or doing my shift tomorrow. And I’ll stick with my shift tomorrow’.” * Dr Scriven is a former president of the Society for Acute Medicine, which represents doctors who specialise in acute medicine and look after patients who do not need surgery, including many who are Covid+;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/covid-is-affecting-all-of-acute-care-so-the-system-sludges-up;7
117;117;5358;5358;Ministers must act now on NHS staffing crisis, health chiefs warn;2022-01-05T21:01:13Z;['Andrew Gregory', 'Denis Campbell', 'Rowena Mason', 'Josh Halliday'];['Coronavirus', 'NHS', 'UK news', 'Hospitals', 'Health', 'Society', 'England', 'Health policy'];"Millions of patients will suffer worsening quality of care unless ministers take immediate action to alleviate the staffing crisis engulfing the NHS, health chiefs have warned. The NHS Confederation, which represents the whole healthcare system, is calling for a range of new measures to be implemented in the NHS in England to help overstretched hospitals and struggling ambulance, mental health, community, GP and social care services cope with “widespread” shortages of medics and health workers. Tens of thousands of medical students should be deployed on to wards and other healthcare settings, NHS and social care staff must be granted priority access to lateral flow and PCR tests, and the self-isolation period should be reviewed to see if it could be slashed from 10 days to five, as had happened in the US and France, it said. MPs warned on Thursday that Omicron, NHS-wide understaffing and heavy demand for A&E services were likely to derail efforts to tackle the backlog of 5.83 million people awaiting surgery. “Our report finds that the government’s recovery plans risk being thrown off course by an entirely predictable staffing crisis,” said Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the Commons health and social care select committee. “The current wave of Omicron is exacerbating the problem but we already had a serious staffing crisis, with a burnt-out workforce, 93,000 vacancies and no sign of any plan to address this.” Growing numbers of operations are being cancelled, with more than 20 NHS trusts declaring an “internal critical incident” in recent days as they struggle to cope with the intense Covid pressure. It emerged on Wednesday that at least four more NHS trusts have taken that step, the highest form of alert any hospital can issue, as had the entire NHS in Norfolk. NHS staff absences had spiralled to double what they normally would be at this time of year, and 17,276 people were in hospital in the UK with Covid – up 58% in a week – as Omicron continued to put “enormous strain” on every part of the health service, the NHS Confederation added. The absence of tens of thousands of staff was already having a “detrimental” impact on the ability of the NHS to provide healthcare, it said, and without further measures, the staffing crisis “threatens the quality of patient care”. Given the worsening situation, there should also be “explicit acknowledgment” from the national regulators that clinical tasks “might need to be allocated in ways which would not normally be recognised as best practice”, the NHS Confederation said. Matthew Taylor, its chief executive, told the Guardian that in the last 24 hours hospital bosses had become “extremely concerned” about the widening ratio of staff to patients. Boris Johnson said on Wednesday he was right not to take any further action.
The prime minister told MPs the cabinet had agreed to keep the existing plan B restrictions and ease travel testing rules. He also confirmed plans being implemented across the UK to end the requirement for confirmatory PCR tests for asymptomatic people who test positive using a lateral flow device (LFD). An estimated 3.7 million people in the UK had Covid in the week ending 31 December, the highest number since comparable figures began in autumn 2020, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. In England one in 15 people in private households had Covid-19, according to ONS estimates. The level is one in 10 in London. A further 194,747 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases were recorded in the UK as of 9am on Wednesday, while 334 more deaths were recorded – although this figure includes a backlog of hospital data from England since 1 January. “It’s clear that we are facing a staffing crisis in the NHS, with a number of hospitals telling us they have around 10% of their staff in self-isolation or on sick leave for other reasons,” Taylor said. “This is pushing up the ratio of staff to patients to levels hospitals are extremely concerned about. “The prime minister’s attempts to reassure the public that the NHS is not being overwhelmed will not chime with the experience of staff working in some parts of the NHS. The government now needs to do all it can to mobilise more staff and other resources for the NHS to get through this extremely challenging period.” While he welcomed Johnson’s announcement that 100,000 critical workers would get direct access to testing from next week, the move “does not go far enough”, Taylor said, and NHS, social care and other key workers should also have “priority access” to tests. He said there was “merit” in reviewing the self-isolation period “to see if the evidence supports a halving of the period to five days”. “We also need other short-term measures, including deploying medical students on wards and taking other steps to cover rota gaps,” he added. All of Greater Manchester’s 17 hospitals have postponed non-urgent surgery. Its healthcare system would not necessarily be able to “ride out” the wave of Omicron infections, the mayor, Andy Burnham, said, with the number of Covid patients in the region’s hospitals almost tripling in the past two weeks, from 346 people to 1,020. Cara Charles-Barks, the chief executive of the Royal United Hospitals Bath trust, one of those to declare an internal critical incident, said it had done so on New Year’s Eve “due to ongoing pressures caused by both Covid and non-Covid patients, sickness among our staff and availability of beds”. University Hospitals Dorset, which runs acute hospitals in Bournemouth and Poole, is preparing to cancel some routine operations after also declaring a critical incident. On Wednesday Poole hospital had only four free beds while Bournemouth had 25. The same level of sickness absence prompted West Suffolk hospital to join the lengthening list of trusts declaring an incident. Both the acute trusts which provide care to people in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire also declared an internal critical incident over the bank holiday weekend. The chief executive of one trust in the north of England said it has had to scale back non-urgent surgery after the number of Covid inpatients it is treating soared by 80% since Christmas Eve. “We are doing priority one and priority two surgical cases, with others having to be cancelled,” the chief executive told the Guardian. The trust is also redeploying staff because 10% of frontline personnel are off sick. “The NHS runs hot all of the time so it doesn’t have the reserve for extraordinary events. Something has to give and, as in previous waves, it will be the care that can be delayed and it will be the goodwill and potentially the wellbeing of staff.” • This article was amended on 6 January 2022 to correct a misspelling of the surname of Cara Charles-Barks.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/ministers-must-act-now-on-nhs-staffing-crisis-health-chiefs-warn;7
118;118;5360;5360;UK and Ireland may favour Euro 2028 bid over 2030 World Cup;2022-01-05T20:48:41Z;['Paul MacInnes'];['Euro 2028', 'Football', 'European Championship', 'World Cup', 'Uefa', 'Fifa', 'The FA', 'Football politics', 'Sport'];"Uefa would welcome a bid for the 2028 European Championship from the UK and Republic of Ireland after hopes of bringing the 2030 World Cup there began to fade. The English Football Association is undertaking a feasibility study into a World Cup bid after receiving £2.8m of funding from the UK government. But while a final decision has not been taken, senior figures in the organisation believe any bid is unlikely to succeed.
The Guardian understands the Scottish FA is also uncertain over making a commitment to the 2030 project after proposed funding for the refurbishment of Hampden Park as part of the deal was not forthcoming from Whitehall. The Conservative party made a 2030 bid part of its 2019 election manifesto and last summer Boris Johnson said it was “the right time” to “bring football home”. The pledge was made alongside a commitment to put £550m into the game in the UK, with £50m released last year. A World Cup bid is likely to face several challenges, however, not least the prospect of a strong rival European candidacy in the form of a joint bid from Spain and Portugal, and a shared South American offering on the centenary of the first World Cup in Uruguay. Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, has said he wants to back only one European bid. In a failed bid to secure the 2018 World Cup the English FA received only two votes in 2010 and although the process now gives a vote to each of the 211 members of the Fifa congress, a UK and Ireland vote is again likely to struggle to reach widespread support. An alternative European Championship bid has therefore been gaining traction inside the five associations and relations with Uefa are strong despite the unrest at the Euro 2020 final last year. Ceferin told the Times that the incident “could have happened anywhere,” calling London “a great hub” for hosting a major sporting event. Uefa recently announced that a one-off match between Italy, the European champions, and Argentina, the Copa América winners, would take place at Wembley in June. At the 2028 European Championship the number of competing teams could be expanded to 32, with the facilities offered by the five nations likely unrivalled by alternative bidders. Any proposal to host the 2030 World Cup must be submitted to the Fifa Council before a meeting of the Congress on 31 March. The English FA did not comment on the possibility of not proceeding but referred to a previous joint statement about the feasibility study which said: “Staging a Fifa World Cup would provide an incredible opportunity to deliver tangible benefits for our nations. If a decision is made to bid for the event, we look forward to presenting our hosting proposals to Fifa and the wider global football community.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/uk-and-ireland-may-favour-2028-euros-bid-over-2030-world-cup;4
119;119;5361;5361;BLM protesters cleared over toppling of Edward Colston statue;2022-01-05T20:28:14Z;['Damien Gayle'];['Bristol', 'Protest', 'Slavery', 'UK news', 'Black Lives Matter movement'];"Anti-racism campaigners have hailed a jury’s decision to clear protesters responsible for toppling a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston as a huge step in getting the UK to face up to its colonial past. Jake Skuse 33, Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, did not dispute the roles they had played in pulling down the statue and throwing it into Bristol harbour during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest but all denied criminal damage. In closing statements following the nine-day trial, the defence had urged jurors to “be on the right side of history”, saying the statue, which stood over the city for 125 years, was so indecent and potentially abusive that it constituted a crime. After just under three hours’ deliberation, a jury of six men and six women found the so-called “Colston Four” not guilty by an 11 to one majority decision at Bristol crown court on Wednesday afternoon. “This verdict is a milestone in the journey that Bristol and Britain are on to come to terms with the totality of our history,” said David Olusoga, the broadcaster and historian of the slave trade, who gave evidence in the trial. Olusoga said: “For 300 years Edward Colston was remembered as a philanthropist, his role in the slave trade and his many thousands of victims were airbrushed out of the story. The toppling of the statue and the passionate defence made in court by the Colston Four makes that deliberate policy of historical myopia now an impossibility.” Clive Lewis, the Labour MP, said: “A British jury has confirmed the toppling of Edwards Colston’s statue was not a criminal act. The real crime was the fact the statue was still there when protesters pulled it down. “Today’s verdict makes a compelling case that a majority of the British public want to deal with our colonial and slave trading past, not run away from it. That’s important to understand and I hope it gives political leaders a little more confidence when it comes to challenging the ‘culture war’ our government is currently pursuing.” But some critics reacted with fury. Scott Benton, a Conservative MP, denounced the verdict as an “absolutely appalling decision”, tweeting: “Are we now a nation which ignores violent acts of criminal damage? This sends out completely the wrong message.” The former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie said he could not help “questioning the sanity of the jury”. He added: “The verdict was a shocking signal to every lefty protester in the country that they can damage with impunity as long as they chant the phrase hate crime.” After the statue was toppled, on 7 June 2020, the home secretary, Priti Patel had demanded that police pursue those responsible, saying their behaviour was “utterly disgraceful”. The Home Office did not comment following the verdicts. The four defendants laughed with relief as the verdicts were returned. They emerged from court wearing T-shirts designed by the Bristolian street artist Banksy to raise funds for their legal fight, and hugged the many supporters waiting outside. “This is a victory for Bristol,” Willoughby said. “This is a victory for racial equality and it’s a victory for anybody who wants to be on the right side of history.” In the trial, in which few facts were in question, the four defendants argued that their actions were justified because the statue was so offensive. Each defendant described being motivated by sincere antiracist conviction, frustration that previous attempts to persuade the council to remove the statue had failed, and a belief that the statue was so offensive it constituted an indecent display or a hate crime. Colston was a 17th-century shareholder in the Royal African Company when it shipped 84,000 Africans into slavery, including 12,000 children; he rose to become the equivalent of a modern chief executive, Olusoga had told the trial. Overall, he said, the company “transported more Africans into slavery than any other company in the whole history of the slave trade in the north Atlantic”. The judge, Peter Blair QC, the recorder of Bristol, allowed expert evidence from Olusoga despite past comments that he “desperately” wanted to join protesters that day, which were raised as a sign of potential bias by the prosecution. The prosecution argued that the fact Colston was a slave trader was “wholly irrelevant”. William Hughes QC, for the crown, said the case was about “cold hard facts” and the “rule of law”. Jurors were shown CCTV capturing each of the defendants playing roles in toppling Colston. Bristol council’s head of culture, Jon Finch, gave evidence of damage to the statue, which lost a cane and part of a coattail. He confirmed £350 damage to the harbour railings and £2,400 to the pavement. The Colston statue was approved in 1895 by the council, which had not given permission to anyone to alter, damage or remove the statue on 7 June, the trial heard. But Liam Walker QC, representing Willoughby, said: “Each of these defendants were on the right side of history, and I submit, they were also on the right side of the law. Colston’s deeds may be historical but the continued veneration of him in this city was not. The continued veneration of him in a vibrant multicultural city was an act of abuse.” Ponsford told jurors: “I thought that a statue that celebrates a figure such as Colston was disgraceful, and offensive to the people of Bristol.” Graham, who had also brought rope to the scene, said she had acted out of “allyship and solidarity” with people of colour. Skuse admitted helping roll the Colston statue to Pero’s bridge (named after an enslaved man who lived in Bristol), where it was thrown into the water, “sentencing [Colston] to death”. Skuse said: “I knew I was in the right, I knew everyone wanted it down. I knew Bristol wanted it, everyone wanted the same thing.” The court heard from black Bristolians including a former lord mayor of the city, Cleo Lake, who had removed a portrait of Colston from her office. “He was the person responsible for brutalising my ancestors, taking away their humanity, and for me and my community experiencing the harm they still experience today,” Lake said. Responding to the verdict, Liz Hughes, chief superintendent of Avon and Somerset police, said the toppling of the statue was an incident that “attracted worldwide attention and … polarised public opinion”, which the force had had a duty to investigate. “Having been presented with the evidence, a jury has now determined their actions were not criminal, and we respect its decision.” • This article was amended on 11 January 2022.

A statement confirms that the ceremony has been postponed indefinitely with no new date yet announced. The awards were set to take place on 31 January at the Crypto.com center in Los Angeles and while sporting events have still been taking place there, sources claim that artists and executives have expressed concern over attending this year’s Grammys ceremony.
“The health and safety of those in our music community, the live audience and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly to produce our show remains our top priority,” the statement read. “Given the uncertainty surrounding the Omicron variant, holding the show on January 31st simply contains too many risks. We look forward to celebrating music’s biggest night on a future date, which will be announced soon.” Los Angeles has been seeing a surge in cases along with the rest of the country with a record-breaking number of cases. On 4 January, more than 22,000 people in Los Angeles county tested positive, almost double the previous peak at the start of 2021. This year’s ceremony was set to be hosted by Trevor Noah with nominations led by Jon Batiste, HER and Justin Bieber. Last year’s awards were also delayed until March. The postponement follows a string of other shifts within the entertainment industry including a hiatus for Broadway shows including The Music Man (after stars Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster both tested positive for Covid-19) and Mrs Doubtfire and today, this year’s Sundance film festival also announced it was ditching its hybrid physical and digital plans to go fully online later this month, in line with last year. “Despite the most ambitious protocols, the Omicron variant with its unexpectedly high transmissibility rates is pushing the limits of health safety, travel and other infrastructures across the country,” organizers said in a statement.

121;121;5363;5363;California bill would hold gunmakers liable for injuries or deaths;2022-01-05T20:14:08Z;['N/A'];['California', 'US news', 'US gun control', 'US politics'];"Some Democratic California lawmakers want to make it easier for people to sue gun companies for liability in shootings that cause injuries or deaths, a move advocates say is aimed at getting around a US law that prevents such lawsuits and allows the industry to act recklessly. In general, when someone is injured or killed by gunfire it’s very hard for the victim or their family to hold the gun manufacturer or dealer responsible by suing them and making them pay damages. A federal law prevents most of those types of lawsuits. But US law does permit some types of liability lawsuits, including when gunmakers break state or local laws regarding the sale and marketing of their products. Last year, New York approved a first-in-the-nation law declaring such violations a “public nuisance”, opening up gunmakers to lawsuits.
On Tuesday, the California assembly member Phil Ting of San Francisco unveiled a bill modeled after the New York law. “Almost every industry in the US is held liable for what their products do … The gun industry is the one exception,” Ting said. “Financial repercussions may encourage the firearms industry and dealers to be more responsible.” The bill is co-authored by assembly members Chris Ward of San Diego and Mike Gipson of Carson. Gipson’s son, his son’s fiancee and another man were shot in Los Angeles in April 2020. Gipson’s son and fiancee survived. But the other man, Gary Patrick Moody, was killed. “This is absolutely personal to me,” said Gipson, a former police officer. The New York bill is already being challenged in court by gunmakers. And critics were swift to denounce the California proposal as well. Gun advocates denounced the bill, known as AB1594, as a smokescreen for another attempt by California progressives to ban guns. Sam Paredes, executive director of Gun Owners of California, compared it to suing the California governor, Gavin Newsom, because he owns a winery and people have misused his products by drinking and driving. “He can’t ban guns, but he’s going to try to bankrupt lawful firearms-related businesses,” Paredes said. California already has some of the toughest gun laws in the country, including a ban on most assault weapons that has been in place for decades. But last year, a federal judge overturned California’s assault weapons ban, prompting a lengthy appeals process. Angered by the move, Newsom last month asked the state legislature to pass a law allowing citizens to enforce the state’s assault weapons ban through lawsuits. The idea is similar to a Texas law that bans most abortions but leaves it up to private citizens to enforce the law by taking offenders to court. The bill announced on Tuesday would not do that. Instead, Ting said it would let people and governments sue gun manufacturers or dealers for liability in shooting deaths or injuries. That’s a key distinction from the Texas abortion law, which is only enforceable by private lawsuits. It’s unclear what these potential lawsuits against gunmakers could include. The bill filed in the state legislature is just one sentence long, declaring gun manufacturers have created a public nuisance if their failure to follow state and local gun laws result in injury or death. The bill will probably be changed several times as it moves through the legislative process. Tanya Schardt, senior counsel for gun control group the Brady Campaign, said lawsuits could include suing gun dealers who knowingly sell weapons to people who then sell them illegally to others who are not allowed to own them. Or it could mean suing a gun manufacturer that supplies dealers they know are selling guns used in crimes. The goal is to “create an environment where the gun industry is held accountable”, Schardt said. Chuck Michel, a civil rights attorney and president of the California Rifle and Pistol Association, said that goal will likely backfire by making it harder for law-abiding citizens to have guns for self-defense. “As a matter of policy, to try and shift the blame for the criminal misuse of a lawful product that is used far more often to save lives and protect lives than to take them is a terrible idea,” he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/california-bill-gunmakers-lawsuit;1

Novak Djokovic spends hours at Melbourne airport over visa mix-up, data confirms Donald Trump’s enduring hold over vast sections of America and Covid concerns in a Sydney nursing home. The world No 1 men’s tennis player Novak Djokovic has been held at passport control in Melbourne for several hours, throwing fresh doubt over his participation at the Australian Open. It comes after the reigning Australian Open champion was announced he had been granted a Covid-19-related “medical exemption” by tournament organisers. Scott Morrison has said there would be no “special rules” for the Serbian, and if he failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his medical exemption the 20-time Grand Slam champion will be “on the next plane home”. Djokovic has refused to reveal his Covid vaccine status and has been an outspoken opponent of vaccination for the coronavirus. A major Covid outbreak at a Sydney nursing home has left residents reportedly “petrified”, with families questioning how the disease spread to 38 residents and 25 care staff and the timing of booster shots. Meanwhile, importers of Covid rapid tests have blamed regulatory delays for preventing home use, further strangling supply at a time of peak demand. One company claims they’ve been waiting three months for the national regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, to give the green light for its product to be used at home. More than 40% of Americans still do not believe that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 US presidential election, a new poll has found, despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud ever being proven. The data was released on the first anniversary of the 6 January attack on the Capitol, provoked by Donald Trump’s claim that the election was stolen. New research has also found that more than 1,000 Americans in positions of public trust acted as “accomplices” in attempting to overturn the 2020 result. The former president earlier cancelled a press conference scheduled to mark the day. Australia

The pernicious effect of social media on youth mental health has been a repeated focus for Scott Morrison, with the prime minister campaigning prominently on reforming online safety.

123;123;5365;5365;Nurse ‘victimised’ for wearing cross at work was unfairly dismissed, tribunal rules;2022-01-05T20:07:01Z;['Harriet Sherwood'];['NHS', 'Discrimination at work', 'UK news', 'Religion'];A nurse who claimed she was victimised for wearing a necklace with a Christian cross at work has won a case for unfair dismissal. Mary Onuoha, a theatre practitioner at Croydon university hospital, Surrey, was discriminated against and harassed, an employment tribunal ruled on Wednesday. Onuoha, a Catholic, wore a necklace with a small cross pendant both in and out of work as a symbol of her religious devotion. However, Croydon Health Services NHS Trust’s uniform policy prohibited the wearing of necklaces in clinical areas on the basis that they could be a health and safety risk. Onuoha was asked to remove her necklace in 2014, 13 years after she began working at the hospital. She refused for religious reasons, and refused again when the issue was raised again in 2015 and 2016. Further efforts by the trust to get Onuoha to remove the necklace, or wear it inside her uniform, failed. She was suspended from clinical duties and demoted to working as a receptionist which she said left her feeling humiliated. She resigned in 2020 and claimed constructive and unfair dismissal. She argued that the trust had breached her right to religion under article 9 of the European convention on human rights, and that her treatment was religious discrimination, harassment and victimisation under the 2010 Equality Act. According to the tribunal’s ruling, the wearing of jewellery, including necklaces, was “rife” among the trust’s workforce and was “widely tolerated” by management. The trust allowed employees to wear other items of religious apparel such as headscarves, turbans and kalava bracelets. “There was no proper explanation as to why those items were permitted but a cross-necklace was not,” the ruling said. The trust had “directly discriminated against and harassed” Onuoha, and her “dismissal had been both discriminatory and unfair”. However, the suggestion that the trust had deliberately targeted the cross necklace as a symbol of the Christian faith or that the trust had acted out of “any kind of prejudice towards the Christian faith” was rejected by a majority of the tribunal. Onuoha said: “My cross has been with me for 40 years. It is part of me, and my faith, and it has never caused anyone any harm. “At this hospital there are members of staff who go to a mosque four times a day and no one says anything to them. Hindus wear red bracelets on their wrists and female Muslims wear hijabs in theatre. “Yet my small cross around my neck was deemed so dangerous that I was no longer allowed to do my job. I am a strong woman but I have been treated like a criminal.” Andrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre which supported Onuoha’s case, said: “From the beginning this case has been about the high-handed attack from the NHS bureaucracy on the right of a devoted and industrious nurse to wear a cross – the worldwide, recognised and cherished symbol of the Christian faith. “Any employer will now have to think very carefully before restricting wearing of crosses in the workplace.”;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/nurse-victimised-for-wearing-cross-at-work-was-unfairly-dismissed-tribunal-rules;7

Beneath a grey sky and in a ceremony laced with symbolism and repentance, Governor John Bel Edwards signed the pardon for Plessy, a Creole man of color who purchased a ticket for a whites-only train cabin and was subsequently arrested for violating Louisiana’s Separate Car Act. Plessy’s case resulted in the infamous 1896 court decision, which legalized the “separate but equal” doctrine and ushered in the Jim Crow era of racist segregation. “The stroke of my pen on this pardon, while momentous, it doesn’t erase generations of pain and discrimination. It doesn’t eradicate all the wrongs wrought by the Plessy court, or fix all of our present challenges,” Edwards said. “But this pardon is a step in the right direction.” The ceremony, on the grounds of the old station that is now a campus for the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, was attended by descendants of both Plessy and John Ferguson, the Louisiana judge who initially ruled against Plessy before the case made it to the supreme court.
“This is truly a blessed day for ancestors and elders. For children and children yet to be born,” said Keith Plessy, Homer’s cousin three times removed. Holding back tears, he continued: “I feel like my feet are not touching the ground today, because the ancestors are carrying me.” The ceremony began with a rendition of the hymn Lift Every Voice and Sing, performed by a cellist, Kate Dillingham, descended from the lone dissenting supreme court justice in the Plessy case, John Marshall Harlan. In his dissent, Harlan wrote that the ruling “will, in time, prove to be quite as pernicious as the decision made by this tribunal in the Dred Scott case” – a reference to the 1857 decision that said no Black person who had been enslaved or was descended from a slave could ever become a US citizen. The Louisiana parole board voted unanimously in November to pardon Plessy, leaving the final act in the process with Governor Edwards. The pardon marked the first time Louisiana’s Avery C Alexander pardon law, passed in 2006 to allow victims of racist laws clemency, has been used in the state. The effort was driven by New Orleans’s recently elected district attorney, Jason Williams, a progressive reformer who came to office on a wave of grassroots support. On Wednesday, Williams addressed the ceremony, insisting that the district attorney’s office should never have prosecuted Plessy at all. “It was important that the office that prosecuted Homer Plessy be the office that asked for his name to be pardoned,” Williams said. “My predecessor should not have prosecuted Homer Plessy.” He continued: “I did not submit this pardon asking for Homer Plessy to be forgiven. I submitted it asking for us, the institution, to be forgiven.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/homer-plessy-supreme-court-pardon-louisiana-new-orleans;5
125;125;5367;5367;Johnson fumbles and flails under pressure from Rayner | John Crace;2022-01-05T20:02:46Z;['John Crace'];['Coronavirus', 'Boris Johnson', 'Angela Rayner', 'UK news', 'Keir Starmer', 'Politics', 'Labour', 'Conservatives'];"It’s an ill wind and all that. With Keir Starmer testing positive for Covid for the second time in a matter of months, it was the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, who got to take on Boris Johnson at the first prime minister’s questions of the new year. Which was just the news that Johnson didn’t want to hear, because Rayner is his worst nightmare. First off, she’s a woman and Boris has a major problem relating to women without mansplaining. More importantly, though, she’s a working-class woman who is very comfortable speaking her mind. Where Starmer may back off and err on the side of caution and politesse, Rayner is never happier than when going toe to toe. Especially when she’s up against someone who is struggling in the polls and whom she doesn’t much respect. Rayner began with a flick at the ongoing investigation into parties at No 10 – it never hurts to remind your opponent of nasties coming down the road – before homing in on the here and now. In October he had said that fears of inflation were unfounded. Given that inflation was now running at 6%, how had he managed to get it all so wrong? “Um, er,” said Johnson. For a moment – the trademark hesitations and incoherence aside – it looked as though Johnson might actually try to answer the question directly. He even began a half-formed sentence to that end. Then half way through he gave up and decided to do what he always does. When under pressure or not. He started lying. How could he have forgotten to do something so natural to him? Maybe it was the Rayner effect. “I said no such thing,” he continued. It was a pure invention that just happened to have been captured in an interview he had given to Sky. From that point on, Johnson was pretty much lost, careering from one car crash to the next. In between wittering on about cold weather payments and the warm home discount – he claimed it was worth £140 a week: it isn’t, it’s £140 a year, though this was probably less a lie and more total ignorance – he just bounced from one lie to the next causing ever greater self-harm. First he tried to claim that the country would be in lockdown if Labour had got its way. Where he got this idea from is anyone’s guess. Most likely it was his own wish fulfilment; what he would have liked to do had he not been too weak to face down the rightwing libertarians in the Tory party. All Labour had ever done was back plan B and said it would be guided by the scientific data. Then he smashed into the next lie. Labour was committed to nationalising the gas industry. It isn’t: Starmer has specifically ruled that out. Then, when Rayner wondered why the government was so keen to rule out cutting VAT on fuel bills – something Johnson had promised as a Brexit dividend – Boris exploded into faux outrage. How dare people who had voted to stay in the EU demand that he keep his promises? He was fully entitled to break as many as he liked to remainers. And, in any case, Labour wanted to rejoin the EU. Pure fantasy. Even the Lib Dems have given up on that one. When Starmer is faced with so many lies in a matter of minutes, he tends to have a mini-meltdown himself. As if the idea of a prime minister being unable to tell the truth does not compute with his version of reality. And you can sort of see his point. It’s a sign of how low we’ve sunk into the shit that we’ve grown used to the idea of Johnson as a serial liar. We don’t expect anything else from him. But where Keir, frets, Rayner runs with it. Sensing Boris was badly losing the plot – if you can lose something you never really had – she paused to ask if he was feeling OK? And he really wasn’t. He was having one of his worst days. He knew that all of his lies would unravel long before the end of PMQs but was unable to prevent himself from telling them. He was so busted. So exposed. He knew it and his own benches knew it. Some Tories tried to offer some encouragement – their jobs are hanging by the same thread as Boris’s and, like it or not, they are symbiotically entwined with him – but it was all a bit half-hearted. Not least because all the red wall MPs care about their constituents’ cost of living. The session ended with Edward Leigh moaning about foreigners. Boris couldn’t bring himself to tell him Vote Leave had promised Indians they could come to the UK post Brexit. Things didn’t much improve for Johnson when he came to give the Covid statement right after PMQs. There again, it’s never the easiest lie to spin that you’ve made all the right calls for the right reasons, when everyone knows that you only did what your party would allow. Or more specifically what the Coronavirus Recovery Group would allow. Donkeys led by yet more donkeys. Rayner pointed out some of the more obvious dangers of hospitals being overwhelmed, operations cancelled and people with heart attacks expected to take a bus to A&E but it was the SNP’s Ian Blackford who got to the heart of the matter. Riding out the pandemic had consequences. More people would die. Which probably wouldn’t affect Boris or many Tory MPs that much, but would certainly be one hell of a bummer for those who died. And for their friends and families. So maybe now was the time for a bit more caution. A bit of humility. Only Johnson doesn’t do caution or humility. He just ducks and dives, doing what he needs to do to get through to the end of the day more or less intact. The consequences left to pile up for tomorrow. Steve Baker and Mark Harper, two hardline members of the CRG, invited Boris to end all restrictions now. In their world, it is their bravery in standing up to Omicron that had forced it into being weaker than Delta. Had the government imposed another lockdown, Omicron would have been inspired to be a much stronger variant. Or something. Whatever drugs they are on, count me out. Boris hummed and hahed, before saying the plan B restrictions ended in three weeks anyway and he would see how things had panned out by then. Hopefully all those who were going die would hurry up and get their dying in during the next weeks so he would then be able to wing it again. It’s come to something that surviving this episode of the pandemic will come down to luck rather than scientific judgement. Then Boris will be Boris.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/05/johnson-fumbles-and-flails-under-pressure-from-rayner;1
126;126;5368;5368;Australian researchers baffled as endangered purple-crowned fairy wrens breed outside season – again;2022-01-05T20:00:42Z;['Royce Kurmelovs'];['Western Australia', 'Birds', 'Environment', 'Australia news'];"Researchers studying the purple-crowned fairy wren in far northern Western Australia have discovered the birds romancing outside the normal breeding season for the second year running. The development is highly unusual in the 16-year program at the Australian Wildlife Conservancy’s (AWC) Mornington Wildlife Sanctuary, which closely monitors the birds and was identified in a three-week survey carried out during the dry season in October and November. Ordinarily breeding takes place during the wet season between December to April when insects are plentiful. It is indicated by “brood patches” – bare patches on the belly – of female birds and bent tail feathers caused when they nest their eggs in cramped nests.
But Dr Niki Teunissen, a postdoctoral research fellow at Monash University who conducted the recent dry-season survey, said that when she caught female birds they showed all the telltale signs of a “busy season”. “Some of those females already had fledglings, so they’d already successfully bred,” Teunissen said. “Then I caught them and found that they had brood patches, which means they already had a nest again. So it’s a busy season. “We don’t really understand why it’s happening but we would love to find out.” As it is had occurred for the second year running the discovery upended much of what researchers thought they knew about the bird’s lifecycle. Teunissen said there may be several contributing factors for the birds changing up their schedule, though so far any theories were “speculative” without further research. She said the region had experienced good rainfall after a period of drought which may make it more attractive for the birds, especially as life can be difficult during the wet season.
Not only is their habitat – wetlands along rivers – under threat from fire and cattle grazing, but it is also prone to flash flooding during the wet season that can see local waterways rise metres in a matter of minutes. Last wet season 40% – two in every five nests – were washed away. Another contributing factor may be pressure from cuckoos that lay their eggs in the wrens’ nests for the wrens to raise. As the cuckoos are not around in the dry season it is possible the wrens have adapted. “What I take away from it is that if anything these birds are clearly more flexible in terms of the time of breeding than we thought,” Teunissen said.

The purple-crowned fairy wren has two sub-species – the eastern sub-species and the western sub-species. The population being studied by the AWC belongs to the western sub-species. The birds get their name for the purple crown the males wear during the breeding season. This colouring fades when not in season, but last season they were purple all year round. With only an estimated 7,000 birds in the wild they are considered an endangered population that is in decline. The birds only live for four years on average, however the oldest bird tracked by the program has lived to 15 years.
Unlike the superb fairy wren, which has a reputation for promiscuity with the female birds regularly cheating on their partners, Teunissen says purple-crowned fairy wren’s are “quite faithful”. The birds do not always mate for life but they can form stable relationships with couples raising their young together and defending their territory together outside breeding season.
While the longest breeding pairs last eight years, Teunissen says divorce is not unheard of. “And what we find is that usually when divorce happens the female leaves to join a male elsewhere who’s got better habitat, so it’s all about real estate really,” she said. “It really is a soap opera and we follow them in so much detail that we know exactly what each individual bird is up to sometimes.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/06/australian-researchers-baffled-as-endangered-purple-crowned-fairy-wrens-breed-outside-season-again;3
127;127;5369;5369;Folk review – a beautifully brooding tale of song and sisterhood;2022-01-05T20:00:42Z;['Arifa Akbar'];['Theatre', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Hampstead theatre', 'Folk music', 'Music'];"This beautifully brooding slice of English pastoral places Cecil Sharp, the godfather of folk music who collected thousands of songs from rural communities, alongside two women he met in 1903. They were half-sisters, Louie Hooper and Lucy White, daughters of a renowned singer in south Somerset who, at the start of this drama, has just died, leaving them drenched in grief. It is clear why Nell Leyshon’s script was adapted into a BBC audio drama last year, starring Simon Russell Beale and Amanda Wilkin. It bursts with sound, from distant birdsong to folk tunes the sisters sing as they sew gloves to make ends meet.
But the visual aspects of this production are just as enthralling with Matt Haskins’s dappled light throwing shadows across Rose Revitt’s simple, striking set, sometimes lighting up the sisters with the clarity of a Vermeer painting to capture the everyday drama of bucolic working life. Sharp’s meeting with Louie and his appropriation of her songs lie at the play’s heart, though the sisters’ relationship runs deftly alongside it. The production is paced to perfection by Roxana Silbert and full of delicate but deeply mined emotions, every actor shining in their part. Song is finely integrated into the script with spine-tingling moments when Louie (Mariam Haque, quiveringly expressive) sings her haunting solos. Lucy (Sasha Frost, just as brilliant as the more flirtatious, frustrated sister) intermittently joins in along with her sometimes lover, John (Ben Allen), to give the play a bustling community feel.
Simon Robson’s Sharp is a slyly manipulative figure, quickly switching on the charm when he sees his opportunity with Louie. He goes from cajoling her into singing her mother’s songs for him, even when her grief is raw, to the full-circle betrayal of handing over a book of those songs now “tidied up” and appearing under his authorship. Like Jean Rhys’s 1962 short story, Let Them Call It Jazz, about a Caribbean woman whose song is taken and sung by a man at a west London party, Leyshon explores questions around the archiving and ownership of an oral tradition, capturing all the nuance in the debate, from whether it needs preserving in this formal way to if it can remain authentic in that process. Sharp, who has since been accused of racism and misogyny, not only flattens out Louie’s songs but projects his jingoism on to them. “I see England,” he says when he first hears her sing and speaks of the “purity” of Englishness in her sound, seeing her as a “primitive” force within the land, which sounds close to Rousseau’s Noble Savage. For her, songs are also connected to the land but without his toxic nationalism; as she points out, the songs were passed down to her mother by her “Gypsy” father, who collected his verses through his travels. Where Sharp wants to fix Englishness on to the page in his compositions, she tells him, wisely, that “none of it stays still” and this aspect of the play speaks to contemporary anxieties over nationhood and identity. The play’s intellectual explorations never overshadow its emotional drama; we feel Louie’s betrayal and also a strong sense of the sisters’ complicated bond. Louie’s dependency and Lucy’s desire to leave creates a tension resembling Tennessee Williams siblings. The tenderness between them develops slowly and powerfully, the story in the end as much about their songs, indelibly tied to love, grief, memory and Somerset itself, as it is about what Sharp takes from them.

128;128;5370;5370;Bomb threats at seven HBCUs force students to evacuate or shelter in place;2022-01-05T19:48:12Z;['Alexandra Villarreal'];['US universities', 'Race', 'US education', 'US news'];At least seven historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) across the United States received back-to-back bomb threats this week, forcing students to evacuate or shelter in place while authorities investigated. The threats come amid a dramatic rise in bombings in the US and follow bomb threats at other US colleges last November. The targeted HBCUs spanned six states and Washington DC, including Prairie View A&M University in Texas, the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Howard University, Florida Memorial University, Norfolk State University in Virginia, North Carolina Central University, and Xavier University in New Orleans. Some students and university employees were put on lockdown, while others were forced to relocate off-campus. The schools have since given the all-clear, the Washington Post reported. Whether the barrage of violent threats targeting universities that have historically served Black students was a series of isolated events or part of a larger conspiracy was not immediately clear, the Post reported. While some of the threats were later deemed unfounded, police warned that at least one had been “very real”, according to local New Orleans news channel WDSU. None resulted in explosions. The incidents were not the first bomb threats on college campuses this academic year. Last semester, three Ivy League schools – Cornell University, Columbia University and Brown University – all reported similar warnings, none of which were found to be credible. This week’s events also come after an alarming uptick in bombings in the US. In a report on 2020, the United States Bomb Data Center recorded 25% fewer bomb threats than in 2019. Yet it tallied 428 actual bombings – a 71% increase from the year before. Officials from the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff asked everyone to remain vigilant, while police told anyone with relevant information to contact the crime stoppers tip hotline.;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/hbcus-bomb-threats-us-colleges-universities-investigation;4
129;129;5371;5371;Welcome back to Test cricket – there’s much life in the grand old game | Barney Ronay;2022-01-05T19:45:03Z;['Barney Ronay'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'England cricket team', 'Ashley Giles', 'Australia cricket team', 'The Ashes', 'Cricket', 'Australia sport', 'Sport'];"And here, as they used to say on TV game shows – as that tumble dryer, that golden fondue set, drifts off down the conveyor belt – is the Test cricket you might have had. Four distinct but interconnected things happened overnight as England and Australia played out the opening rain-addled day of the fourth Ashes Test in Sydney. First, England and Australia played out the opening rain‑addled day at the SCG, where Joe Root’s team produced their most sustained performance of the southern summer.
This should come as no surprise. An Ashes series usually starts on the back of three forgettable warm-up games against motivated, high-calibre opponents. Well, we’ve had those now. History will remember them as the live elements of the 2021-21 Ashes series. In Sydney England finally got to work without the extra handicap – beyond cunning-plan selections and a seriously poor batting lineup – of culture shock and rustiness. It felt like something resembling a contest. Meanwhile, in the same timeline, the second thing was happening. The comically self‑serving words of Ashley Giles, the England and Wales Cricket Board’s managing director (no, me neither) of cricket, will continue to echo around the place once this tour is done. Giles has largely been a mute figure through England’s collapse on his watch as a Test team. He broke his silence on Tuesday to make a startling pronouncement. There is, according to Ashley Giles, no point in sacking Ashley Giles – because you’ll only end up with someone like Ashley Giles. It is almost tempting to leap up and applaud this fantastical piece of non-think, to assume Giles intended this statement as a devastating satire on the spin and blame-avoidance of the ECB. But it seems Giles, who has had three years of constant oversight as England’s MD, really does seem to believe he’s just another victim of this pesky system.
This is the same pesky system that led to the disintegration of the England men’s pathway (overseer: Ashley Giles), too much power in the hands of an outgunned head coach (decided by: Ashley Giles), and the consequent disastrously planned and executed Ashes tour. This, according to Ashley Giles, believer in fate, wyrd, destiny, was all simply preordained. And yet before we become too depressed by the sound of lifeboat hunting, things three and four were also happening. At Mount Maunganui, overnight, Bangladesh produced one of the great moments in modern cricket history. Led by the wonderful Ebadot Hossain, a bolter from the wider sporting superstructure, and glued together by a fine captain and coach, Bangladesh beat the world Test champions New Zealand on their home turf, dishing up an exhilarating spectacle of team chemistry and expert planning. It seems nobody told Ebadot, or the millions cheered through lockdown in Bangladesh, about the death of red-ball cricket, systemic decline and all the rest. Maybe someone from the ECB could have a word.
Meanwhile at the Wanderers, South Africa continued to sustain a gripping, well-matched Test series against India. This is the same South Africa that continue to struggle with culture-scale issues that make English cricket’s whinging about short attention spans and so on look a little deranged. And the same India that is, in English cricket’s playbook, Test cricket’s nemesis, the IPL vandals, but who continue to produce the standard of on-field excellence, and to commit to the format in its year‑round scheduling. The message from Sydney and related points is clear enough. The product is, even now, resilient. This thing has always stunk of death, has always been the object of dire predictions (it’s called the Ashes for a reason). But it is possible with competence and good intentions to preserve Test cricket. Even – imagine that – to promote it. England’s players also did their bit on day one. They bowled well, which they have throughout the series, and caught well, which they haven’t. Much attention will focus on Stuart Broad taking the wicket of David Warner, but the idea Broad’s misuse in this series is some kind of overlooked silver bullet is also misguided. England lost the Ashes because of their batting. To date, only two players have passed 50. Broad himself has already played in a 5-0 and a 4-0 defeat and has 13 wickets at 39 over the past year. He should have played in Brisbane and Melbourne. But this is one small strand in a wider bodge.
In Sydney it was Anderson who provided the illumination on a blue-green day. He came back late on, pitched the ball up and got Marcus Harris to edge to slip. Aged 39, Anderson is taking his wickets at 15 and going at 1.6 runs per over in the series. He remains a sporting marvel, but also a one‑man reminder that so much in Test cricket turns on small virtues of craft and planning. Cricketing lore states that you should never judge a pitch until England have had a chance to collapse in a heap on it. But the next few days in Sydney could yet provide a belated show of resistance to that sense of managed decline.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/05/welcome-back-to-test-cricket-theres-much-life-in-the-grand-old-game;4
130;130;5372;5372;Canada plays catchup on rapid testing amid Omicron surge;2022-01-05T19:32:38Z;['Tracey Lindeman'];['Canada', 'Americas', 'World news', 'Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant'];Canadians will receive 140m rapid tests free throughout January, Justin Trudeau announced on Wednesday, as the country struggles to cope with record-breaking Covid case numbers. “With the speed at which Omicron is propagating through our communities and through our country, it makes sense to have rapid testing,” said the prime minister. The health minister Jean-Yves Duclos said that rapid tests are proving to be an important tool in the fight against Covid. But the decision to invest in rapid testing marks a dramatic change in a country where – until last month – rapid tests were not commonly available, despite successful implementation in the US, UK and Europe. The delay of rapid test adoption in Canada was caused by a couple of factors, David Juncker, department chair of biomedical engineering at McGill University, told the Guardian. He said a “false sense of perfection” on testing sensitivity and an unnecessarily complicated maze of rules prevented Canada from acquiring the rapid self-tests the country would have needed to slow the spread of Omicron. “They were focused on sensitivity that they haven’t come around to understand this test is a public health test,” Juncker said. The scientific community has known since the summer of 2020 that Covid-19 tests’ sensitivity is less important than the frequency and speed of testing, particularly when it comes to stopping asymptomatic people from spreading disease. Concerns over sensitivity led to an over-reliance on PCR testing, and slowed down approvals and procurement deals for rapid tests. The current Omicron surge has provincial and territorial PCR facilities completely overwhelmed, which has led some to limit the public’s access to such testing. Provincial governments have also played a key role in the slow adoption of rapid testing. Canada acquired several million rapid tests at the end of 2020. However, most provinces failed to distribute the tests they were given over sensitivity concerns. Juncker said provinces claimed they wanted to do more research before rolling the tests out. On Wednesday, Trudeau was asked whether he had any qualms with the way provinces have chosen to distribute their supplies of rapid tests. He said he hoped they would learn and share best practices, but that the federal government had no real say in the matter. “Our job is to procure as many [tests] as we possibly can,” said Trudeau. The first self-test in Canada was approved only on 23 April 2021, six months after the FDA approved the same test for use in the US. All previously approved tests – including rapid tests – required professional administration or lab processing. Most of the rapid self-tests now available in Canada were only approved in November and December of 2021, including Abbott’s Panbio rapid antigen test which was approved on 21 December. Currently, Canada has an agreement to procure up to 122.9m of those tests. Canada’s increased supply may be a case of better late than never, although 140m a month may not quite cut it. Juncker said with the highly transmissible Omicron, Canadians could need upwards of 600–700m tests a month. “Once the situation subsides, two tests a week [per person] should be fine,” he said.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/canada-rapid-testing-free-omicron-surge;2
131;131;5373;5373;The Guardian view on Trump’s mob, a year on: threats to democracy grow;2022-01-05T19:14:52Z;['Editorial'];['US politics', 'Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden', 'US news', 'Republicans', 'Democrats'];The threat to American democracy may be greater today than when the insurrectionist mob swept into the US Capitol one year ago, attempting to prevent the peaceful transfer of power following a free and fair election. Joe Biden is ensconced in the White House and with the passage of time, the shock of their lethal assault has faded. But if the danger appears less immediate, addressing it is no less urgent. We know more than we did a year ago about the full violence and menace of the riot, and about what preceded it – including the PowerPoint presentation turned over by Donald Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows, detailing ways to stage a coup. Rioters have been jailed, but so far no case has been brought against those who encouraged and incited them. Mr Trump himself has resurged, with a cult-like grip upon his party. He and his allies have longer to plan for this year’s midterms and 2024. State legislatures are constructing an election-stealing machine. In short: 6 January was not an end, but a beginning. Listen to the warnings from America’s political scientists. One says that the US is “closer to civil war than any of us would like to believe”. Another warns that the insurrectionists of 6 January are not part of a fringe: he sees a new mass political movement with violence at its core. Others foresee a slide to Hungarian-style competitive authoritarianism in which the trappings of elections remain, but so rigged that Democrats cannot win. Faced with an electorate that has rejected them, the Republicans have already entrenched their advantage in the electoral college, Senate and supreme court. Yet it is Republicans who claim that the system is cheating them. A vast swathe of the population is now detached from both political reality and political ideals – believing the 2020 election stolen, and believing that force is an acceptable response. “Alternative facts” have become mainstream belief: according to a recent poll, 68% of Americans think there is no evidence of widespread electoral fraud in 2020 – but 62% of Republicans disagree. While 60% of Americans think Mr Trump bears either a “great deal” or a “good amount” of responsibility for the storming of the Capitol, 72% of Republicans say he bears “just some” or “none at all”. Another survey found that 9% of Americans believed that “use of force is justified to restore Donald J Trump to the presidency”. It is hard to know where one might begin to tackle the sprawling rightwing disinformation ecosystem. The aspiration to a policy response to the political chasm – the Build Back Better Act – has been killed by Republican opposition, with the aid of conservative Democrat Joe Manchin. He and fellow Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema will also tank the fresh push on voting rights if they remain opposed to amending the filibuster. Meanwhile, Republicans who attempted to rein Mr Trump in on 6 January, or publicly criticised him afterwards, have long since fallen back into line. In 12 short months they have rewritten history. Their hostility to the select committee investigation, rushing to report before November’s midterms lest it be closed down afterwards, is another attempt to silence the truth. Last year’s tidal wave of voting restrictions at state level continues, and election sabotage is gaining ground, with Republicans giving legislatures control over vote counts and replacing nonpartisan officials with Trumpists. Against these are ranged the steady, committed efforts of activists, politicians and ordinary voters to defend their rights and protect their democratic institutions. More political violence is likely in future, not least because the GOP elite have helped to legitimise it. Senior Republicans have not merely made their peace with Mr Trump and his tactics, but embraced them. Next time, such efforts might gain support from within the services. Yet the deeper threat may be that force will not be required. The dismantling of American democracy could be bloodless: quieter, more sophisticated, more cynical – and nonetheless devastating for it.;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/05/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-mob-a-year-on-threats-to-democracy-grow;1
132;132;5374;5374;The Guardian view on Elizabeth Holmes: fake it to make it until you break it | Editorial;2022-01-05T19:13:34Z;['Editorial'];['Theranos', 'Technology', 'Silicon Valley', 'Law (US)', 'Law'];"The story of how Elizabeth Holmes came to defraud some of the richest and most powerful investors in the US, only to end up this week facing decades in prison, is so epic and outlandish that it is no wonder it has already flowered into a prize-winning book and a popular podcast, and is reportedly on its way to becoming a Hollywood film, with Ms Holmes to be played by Jennifer Lawrence, no less. But it is more than superb entertainment; it is a parable about how our financial system is badly broken. At only 19, Ms Holmes decided to reinvent a fundamental part of healthcare: blood testing. No more painful pinpricks, nor anxious waits for results. She dropped out of Stanford to start Theranos in 2003, and in short order pulled in some of the biggest investors in Silicon Valley, garnered adoring magazine profiles and turned her startup into a firm employing 800 staff and valued at £6.6bn. There was just one problem: the miracle technology was junk. It did not do what it said on the tin. The deception was first exposed in 2015, the company dissolved in 2018 and last August its founder began a four-month long trial. A jury found her guilty this week of four counts of fraud, each carrying a maximum term of 20 years. Ms Holmes is still only 37. When the going was good, she could count among her backers and board members powerbrokers such as Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. The trial revealed how far networking of contacts served to beguile the supposed smart money, who asked few questions but were satisfied instead with a great backstory and the lustre of the names. Investors gave Ms Holmes their millions and sent notes thanking her for taking them. Not far behind were the profile writers. Far from a few suckers getting duped, this was a political-financial-media elite disastrously short on self-doubt. As with Jeffrey Epstein, it required dogged journalism to do the serious investigation and expose the truth. Yet when the Wall Street Journal’s John Carreyrou did ask the necessary questions, Ms Holmes admitted in court that she retaliated by going straight to the newspaper’s owner, Rupert Murdoch – who just happened to be a serious investor in Theranos. The WSJ ran the stories anyway, but another organ under different ownership might not have done. Finally, America and other rich countries have spent years running record-low interest rates and quantitative easing programmes, which have pushed the cost of capital close to zero. This has not sparked a wave of innovation in socially vital technologies, but pumped more air into asset bubbles. And in the case of Theranos, all it has done is provide the kindling for a bonfire of wealth – money that could have been spent more wisely, invested more usefully and done some actual good.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/05/the-guardian-view-on-elizabeth-holmes-fake-it-to-make-it-until-you-break-it;6
133;133;5375;5375;UK Border Force could strike over Channel refugee ‘pushback’ plan;2022-01-05T19:10:27Z;['Nicola Slawson'];['Immigration and asylum', 'Priti Patel', 'Refugees', 'France', 'UK news', 'Europe', 'Migration'];Border Force officials could strike over Priti Patel’s “morally reprehensible” plans to turn back dinghies in the Channel, a union has said. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which represents the vast majority of Border Force staff who would implement the “pushbacks”, has joined forces with the refugee charity Care4Calais to seek a judicial review of the policy, a tactic campaigners warn could put lives at risk. Channel crossings have become one of the most politicised issues in British politics, with the home secretary, Priti Patel, staking her reputation on making the route “unviable”. A total of 28,300 people crossed the Dover Strait onboard small boats in 2021, triple the number for 2020, according to figures compiled by the PA Media news agency. Patel’s borders bill intends to reduce such numbers and contained, until recently, proposals that appeared to criminalise organisations such as the RNLI for rescuing asylum seekers in the Channel. The PCS and Care4Calais intend to challenge the lawfulness of redirecting boats out of UK waters and back to France. The union said the policy “contravenes international law and is morally reprehensible”, and could expose Border Force officials to risk of prosecution. Even if the court application is unsuccessful, the union has not ruled out industrial action and officials refusing to carry out the pushbacks. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “The legality of the pushbacks policy is in serious question, and it is right that the court decides whether it is unlawful to turn back Channel boats. We cannot have a situation where our members could be open to potential civil and criminal action for implementing a policy that they do not agree with and know is not safe. “Although we are hoping for a positive outcome from the legal proceedings, people should be in no doubt PCS strongly opposes this policy, on moral and humanitarian grounds, and we will not rule out industrial action to prevent it being carried out.” Clare Moseley, the founder of Care4Calais, said: “The proposed policy deprioritises the UK’s duty under domestic and international law to save lives at sea. It is for good reason that this duty is a cornerstone of international maritime law. If eroded, I fear it will enable the UK to devalue lives at sea.” “It risks opening the gates to the horrific scenes we are seeing in the Mediterranean,” she added. A Home Office spokesperson said: “As part of our ongoing operational response and to prevent further loss of life at sea, we continue to test a range of safe and legal options to stop small boats making this dangerous and unnecessary journey. “These all comply and are delivered in accordance with both domestic and international law. Our New Plan for Immigration will also overhaul the broken asylum system and reduce many of the historic pull factors.” Despite the home secretary’s pledge to make crossings an “infrequent phenomenon” by spring 2020, more than 36,000 people have succeeded in reaching the UK in the last two years. The government continues to consider various options to tackle the issue and has invited businesses to a non-disclosure-agreement-bound meeting in the hope of hearing “innovative ideas”.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/uk-border-force-could-strike-over-channel-pushback-plan;1
134;134;5376;5376;Protecting vulnerable from £700 hike in energy bills means hard choices now | Nils Pratley;2022-01-05T19:10:04Z;['Nils Pratley'];['Energy industry', 'Energy bills', 'Fuel poverty', 'Business', 'Consumer affairs', 'Household bills', 'Money', 'Poverty', 'Social exclusion', 'Society', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Politics'];It’s choose your poison time for a government that must know allowing low-income households to suffer the full blast of the scheduled rise in energy bills in April is a political non starter. After six months of high gas prices in the wholesale market, the regulator Ofgem’s price-setting formula is likely to spit out a figure close to £2,000 on average for an annual dual-fuel bill, or a year-on-year increase of roughly £700. That is simply unaffordable for many. And the implied £20bn-ish hit to discretionary consumer spending will do little to encourage a whoosh of post-Omicron activity the Treasury is relying on in other areas of the economy. Some form of subsidy or smoothing mechanism for bills must be found. From where the chancellor sits, though, you can see why he may not fancy cutting VAT. It’s charged at 5% on energy bills, so even a temporary removal would only reduce a £2,000 bill by £100. Nor would it be targeted: all bill payers would benefit. On that score, Boris Johnson is correct to describe it as “a blunt instrument”. Rishi Sunak’s real worry, though, may be whether an intended temporary measure could become semi-permanent. The Treasury, remember, is trusting that VAT receipts from electricity will rise over time as fuel duties from petrol and diesel decline when we plug in our electric cars. It needs VAT to be seen as fixed. A windfall tax on North Sea gas producers? That will be tempting, but the design would be key. Some of the producers who are enjoying current conditions are also hooked into government-backed carbon capture projects, so a windfall tax risks complaints about jeopardising long-term incentives and investment. Should nuclear generators, or energy trading firms, also be included since they are also beneficiaries of high wholesale prices? Determining who should pay, and defining a “windfall” profit while wholesale prices are still volatile, can quickly become a messy business. Back in 1997, the beauty of the then chancellor Gordon Brown’s windfall tax on privatised utilities was its simplicity: it was levied on the grounds that the companies had been sold off too cheaply, which was almost unarguable. Definitions were clear and boardroom grumbling could be ignored. Boosting the size and availability of the warm homes discount available to vulnerable households is a far simpler idea. There is at least an established mechanism for payments and the benefits, unlike with a VAT removal, would be targeted. How much would it cost to make a meaningful difference? A case can be made for any number as high as £10bn, which would upset the Treasury’s spending arithmetic for the next financial year. And, again, Sunak may fret about an exit given that analysts expect next autumn’s price cap to be set even higher than April’s. Thus you can see the political temptation to grant a £20bn multi-year loan to energy supply companies to make them manage the headache. The government would avoid the appearance of setting energy bills and consumers would pay over time. It’s hardly a pain-free or risk-free option, however. It means telling consumers their bills won’t fall even when wholesale prices do. And underwriting loans to a sector where two dozen companies have gone bust in the last three months would be a brave move. The government has already nationalised Bulb and probably does not want to add to its collection of failed suppliers. It is hard to predict where ministers will land among this range of unattractive choices, but a massively expanded warm homes scheme gets the vote here. It would be targeted, which is an essential requirement, and would confront the problem head-on instead of putting the bill on the never-never. The hardest part would be expanding the definition of “vulnerable” consumers: the whole point about a £700 hike to the default tariff is that newly vulnerable households will be created, which is the penny that is dropping only belatedly among ministers. Meetings with supply companies, as on Wednesday, don’t change the basic fact that a political choice has to be made about how much money to throw at easing the price shock. Doing nothing is not plausible. Ofgem sets the price cap in early February and any support scheme for low-income households needs to be announced simultaneously. Ministers need to hurry up.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/05/protecting-vulnerable-from-700-hike-in-energy-bills-means-hard-choices-now;2
135;135;5377;5377;BMW unveils car that changes colour at touch of a button;2022-01-05T19:02:38Z;['Dan Milmo'];['BMW', 'Technology', 'Automotive industry', 'Business'];BMW has unveiled a chameleon car that changes colour, in the latest attempt by automotive firms to combine their vehicles with cutting-edge technology. The German car firm said it was “bringing the car body to life” with the specially developed body wrap for its all-electric iX SUV model, which uses the same technology as Amazon’s Kindle e-reader. At the touch of a button, a driver can change the shade of the car’s exterior, allowing the colour to shift between black and white or even light and dark stripes by activating electronic ink in the wraparound shell. “You decide what you want to wear, what your social media status is – and you can decide what your car looks like,” said Stella Clarke, BMW’s project lead on the vehicle. Clarke added that the technology could be used to locate the car by making it flash when the driver is looking for it, or to display the vehicle’s battery capacity externally. According to BMW, the effect is created by applying an electrical charge to microcapsules – which contain particles of white and black pigments – suspended within a liquid encased in the wrap. The colour alternates depending on whether a negative or positive charge is applied, causing either the white or the black pigments to collect at the surface of the microcapsule. The concept car, which is not available for public sale, was unveiled at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, where automotive firms increasingly advertise their products alongside mobile phone, gadget and TV screen makers. The agricultural machinery firm John Deere has unveiled a smartphone-controlled autonomous tractor at CES this week, while Sony revealed plans to start an electric car company, General Motors announced an electric version of its Chevy Silverado pick-up truck and Mercedes-Benz revealed a concept electric car with a range of 1,000km – almost double the distance of a Tesla Model S. Apple, which does not exhibit at CES, has been working on a self-driving electric car that, according to a recent report, could be launched in 2025. New products shown by consumer electronics firms at CES this week include a portable Smart TV projector by Samsung, an autonomous home on wheels from LG and the official name for Sony’s new virtual reality headset, which will be called PlayStationVR2. Many of the product announcements have been made virtually after regular attenders such as Google, Microsoft, Intel and the Facebook owner Meta pulled out of physical appearances due to Covid-19 fears.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/bmw-unveils-car-that-changes-colour-at-the-touch-of-a-button;6
136;136;5378;5378;Dog saves day as ‘real-life Lassie’ leads rescuers to injured men after accident;2022-01-05T18:43:03Z;['Erum Salam'];['New Hampshire', 'US news', 'Dogs', 'Animals'];"New Hampshire police officers were engaged in a low-speed dog-chase on a highway along the state’s border with Vermont when they discovered that a real-life Lassie was leading them to rescue two men thrown from a truck and suffering from hypothermia. The driver, Cam Laundry, 31, and his passenger, Justin Connors, 40, were found injured but alive on Monday thanks to Tinsley, Laundry’s canine companion. Another dog, Connors’ bulldog, was hit by a car and found dead on the side of the road after the accident. Captain Tim Cohen of the Lebanon police department said Laundry’s truck appeared to have fallen from the embankment into the woods “in such a way that it would not normally have been seen by a passing motorist”. “It’s pretty incredible that we were able to help these men, not even knowing that they were there to begin with. It was a good stroke of luck,” Cohen said. “The dog definitely played a large part in this because it drew our attention to that area.” The two friends were heading back home from dinner before the car accident. Laundry was not wearing a seatbelt and was charged with driving under the influence. He called the incident “a wake-up call”. “I couldn’t believe the amount of intelligence she had to know that we were in distress and kind of do a Lassie-thing and go get help,” Laundry told the Guardian. “I’m still trying to recollect everything that happened. She’s a little guardian angel.”
It was onlookers from the road that first alerted police to the loose German shepherd on a bridge. “Of course we care about the dog. We don’t want to see it get injured, but it can also pose traffic hazards to motorists or pedestrians,” Cohen said. “We wanted to make sure the dog didn’t cause an accident, especially on the interstate.”
“[Tinsley] wouldn’t really get near anybody,” Cohen said. After chasing the dog for five to 10 minutes back and forth between New Hampshire and Vermont on the Veterans Memorial bridge, police followed Tinsley to a gap in the road’s guardrail near the intersection of interstate of 89 and 91, later revealed to be the scene of Laundry’s crash. Emergency services were immediately called. The Lebanon police chief, Phillip Roberts, said he had seen this behavior from police-trained dogs before, but never from a household pet. Laundry is back home now and Connors is recovering from leg and neck surgeries in hospital. “I want my friend Justin to get better as soon as possible. Things could’ve been a lot worse than they were,” Laundry said. “We’re very fortunate to be here today because of my dog, Tinsley.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/real-life-lassie-dog-rescue-new-hampshire;5
137;137;5379;5379;UK firm goes from debt to £20m thanks to lucrative Covid test deals;2022-01-05T18:34:21Z;['Rob Davies'];['Business', 'Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'Infectious diseases'];Two entrepreneurs with no apparent background in healthcare have made £20m – and could make tens of millions more – after landing roles as middlemen between the UK government and a US firm that won £3.7bn of contracts to supply lateral flow tests. Charles Palmer, whose background is in property, and Kim Thonger, a former shoe retailer, are the co-owners of Disruptive Nanotechnology, a business that had just £85 in the bank and debts of £3,592 at the end of 2019. Accounts filed at Companies House last month show that the firm’s net assets soared to £20.5m during the year to 31 December 2020, including the first nine months of the coronavirus pandemic. Disruptive Nanotechnology, trading as Tried&Tested, describes itself as the exclusive UK and EU distributor for rapid antigen and antibody tests made by California-based Innova Medical Group. Palmer’s wife, Dr Rachel Limbrey, is the chief medical adviser at Tried&Tested, as well as working as a respiratory consultant at University Hospital Southampton. Innova has won nine contracts worth a combined £3.7bn to provide tests, thanks in part to Operation Moonshot, the plan by Boris Johnson’s former adviser Dominic Cummings to roll out mass daily testing to reduce the need for strict Covid restrictions. Innova’s chief executive, Daniel Elliott, has said that Disruptive Nanotechnology co-owner Thonger, who founded the company in 2016, “worked tirelessly” to help Innova win the first of its contracts. Elliott said UK officials were “very surprised” by the quantities Innova could supply during discussions that took place in August 2020. “I think that was the ‘A-ha!’ moment for them because they were tasked with what felt like an impossible task,” he said. “We had multiple calls within a 24-hour period. And they kept asking: can you really do this?” A leak of confidential documents in September 2020 revealed the existence of Operation Moonshot, which a briefing paper described as the “only hope” of avoiding a second national lockdown. Launching Moonshot shortly afterwards, Johnson described the plan as giving people the “freedom to mingle” and return to normal. Within weeks, Innova had its first contract, for five shipments between September and early October worth £103.6m. As that one ended, a second, much bigger contract was signed for £496m. They did not go out to tender because of the “extreme urgency” and global demand, according to the contract notice. On 18 December, a third UK contract was published with Innova for £226m. Disruptive Nanotechnology, based in Harrow, north-west London, reportedly receives “a few pennies” for each test supplied by Innova, an arrangement thought to be the reason for the £20m increase in its net assets, first reported by the Daily Mail. But this year could prove even more lucrative. The combined value of Innova’s contracts for 2020, the year in which Disruptive Nanotechnology enjoyed its increase in assets, is £978.5m. Innova has won more than £2.7bn of new testing contracts since then, while the company says it has also provided tests to the public sector, indicating it could be in line for an increase in assets of tens of millions of pounds this year, amid high demand due to the Omicron variant. While the UK government has embraced Innova’s lateral flow tests, regulators in the company’s domestic market, the US, have not. The US Food and Drug Administration recalled Innova’s tests last year, citing concerns about their reliability. Innova has said that the tests are effective. Neither Thonger nor Palmer, who appear to have been instrumental in securing the supply of Innova’s tests, has a background in health or medicine. Thonger worked in marketing and branding for a series of shoe companies, including Dr Martens and Dune, for more than 20 years. Palmer was a chartered surveyor who started his own property company. Thonger founded the business in 2016 but it has never published full accounts due to its tiny size. It previously marketed a technology called LightCleanse that it claimed could be used to clean bacteria and viruses in the air and on surfaces, using nanoparticles of titanium dioxide. It is unclear whether LightCleanse is still functioning but a mobile number listed on the website is no longer active. Palmer became a director of Disruptive Nanotechnology in June 2020, shortly before it began talks with the government, and took a 50% stake in the company at some point during that year. A spokesperson from Disruptive Nanotechnology said: “Disruptive Nanotechnology provides goods and services to hundreds of clients, across many sectors, including vital national infrastructure, oil and energy, education, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, events, sport, retail and media. “Our terms of business with those clients are generally commercially sensitive, therefore we do not comment, except to say it is certain that the Guardian staff and readers benefit at some point during their day from those clients being open and active. “Partly due to our efforts, LFTs [lateral flow tests] have been widely available in the UK since September 2020. We know, and are proud, that lives and livelihoods have been saved as a result.” The Guardian has approached Thonger and Palmer for comment.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/uk-firm-goes-from-debt-to-205m-thanks-to-lucrative-covid-test-deals;2
138;138;5380;5380;More than 40% in US do not believe Biden legitimately won election – poll;2022-01-05T18:16:08Z;['Maya Yang'];['US Capitol attack', 'US politics', 'Joe Biden', 'Donald Trump', 'US news'];"More than 40% of Americans still do not believe that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 presidential election despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud, according to a new Axios-Momentive poll.
The poll, released on the eve of the first anniversary of the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, found that 55% of those surveyed believe Biden won the election. That figure has barely changed since Axios’s poll from 2020, published shortly before the insurrection. That poll, published in 2020, found 58% said that they accepted Biden as the legitimate winner of the presidential election. Despite Biden’s inauguration, the attack on the Capitol and the multiple investigations that have debunked the lies pushed by the former president that the election was stolen, the poll suggests that the same level of doubt persists. “It’s dispiriting to see that this shocking thing we all witnessed last year hasn’t changed people’s perceptions,” Laura Wronski, senior manager for research science at Momentive, told Axios. A majority of Americans also said they are expecting a repeat of the deadly 6 January attack in the next few years. The polls, conducted from 1 to 5 January of this year, surveyed nearly 2,700 adults, and found nearly 57% – about half of Republicans and seven in 10 Democrats – believe that events similar to the attack are likely to occur again. In addition, nearly two-thirds or 63% said that the 6 January attack has at least temporarily changed the way they think about their democratic government. A third said that those changes are temporary. Nearly as many, 31%, said that those changes are permanent. About 37% of those surveyed said they had lost faith in American democracy (48% of Republicans and 28% of Democrats), while 10% said they had never had faith in the system. Forty-nine percent said they did have faith. Fifty-eight per cent of Americans said they supported the investigative work of the House select committee investigating the riot. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats support the inquiry, compared with 58% of independents and 32% of Republicans. Just slightly more than half of American adults, 51%, said individuals associated with the insurrection should face criminal penalties if they refuse to comply with subpoenas. Republicans have also been revealed to be three or four more times as likely as Democrats to say voter fraud is a problem in their state, despite such claims being thoroughly debunked. Wronski said she believes the results of the poll shows either “Biden hasn’t done enough” to push back against disinformation, or “it shows that he never had a chance”. She added: “The partisan division is still the story.” • This article was amended on 6 January 2022 to correct the breakdown by party of responses related to support for the House select committee investigation, and faith in American democracy.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/america-biden-election-2020-poll-victory;1

Born into a Jewish family in Tottenham, north London, Anne was one of the five children of Miriam (nee Weinberg), a seamstress, and Nathan Wrightman, a carpenter. She and her two sisters were evacuated to Cornwall during the second world war, and after finishing her schooling she worked in secretarial roles at Granada TV, the BBC World Service and the National Film Theatre. Inspired by the formation of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in 1958, she quickly became an active CND member until, with her husband, David Mobbs, a biochemist and Communist party member whom she married in 1959, she moved to Nigeria in 1960 with their young children. David lectured at the University of Ibadan while Anne was employed by the university’s drama school and helped to organise film and theatre festivals. That work led her into contact with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, and years later she was involved in protesting against his execution by the Nigerian military.
Anne and her family also lived in Ghana and Zambia, and in Zambia she raised funds for the African National Congress. It was when Anne returned to the UK in 1971 and settled in Oxford that she became part of my life. Growing up under Margaret Thatcher, I was heavily influenced by Anne’s commitment to help those who were suffering in the harsh political climate. She also supported successful campaigns to get Oxford city council to disinvest its pension fund from apartheid South Africa. In her work as an assistant community relations officer in Oxford, from 1975 onwards, she helped to win racial discrimination cases and to organise support for initiatives celebrating black culture. From the late 1980s onwards, Anne was Oxford city council’s Fun in the Parks festival organiser, booking music, bands, circus acts, comedians and stalls. She also helped to set up the annual Oxford international women’s festival, raised the profile of the Oxford bail support group, set up by Asylum Welcome to secure release of those held at Campsfield House detention centre, and was a driving force behind the closure of the centre – garnering support from the band Radiohead. Even in retirement Anne could not resist getting involved, supporting a local group in the Jericho area of Oxford, where she lived. Anne and David separated in 1973 and divorced two years later. She is survived by her children, Keir, Ruth and Amanda, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/anne-mobbs-obituary;5

However, I and many millions of others do not trust this government at all, but we still accepted vaccination. Social factors may explain the existence of vaccine avoidance, but they do not justify it. Under UK laws, no degree of inequality allows a car driver to transfer to the right side of the road in protest against a mistrusted government. True freedom is the liberty from being harmed by others, regardless of whether those actions are deliberately harmful. The freedom to “innocently” spread disease is not a fundamental right. The enormous human cost of supporting unvaccinated and seriously ill patients in hospital is having a direct impact on all our lives. It is time to take the moral high ground: celebrate the vaccinators and publicly avow that vaccination is good, that being vaccinated is a public duty and that failure to comply by any citizen without adequate medical reasons is a dereliction of that public duty. Dr Patrick Byrne Bermondsey, London • John Harris refers to the supposed “coercing [of] people into getting vaccinated using stringent Covid passports”. Having a Covid passport allows people to access certain defined services; if they don’t want to be vaccinated they won’t have access, but no one is forcing them to such access. In any case, there are many actual constraints on people that are a vital part of society, such as wearing seatbelts. No one is being coerced into being vaccinated; this is simply the price for taking part in normal society. Dr Richard Carter Putney, London • Maybe the unvaccinated do deserve our empathy, not judgment, but understanding and feeling their pain doesn’t solve the problem. The fact remains that they endanger themselves but, much more importantly, everybody else through their potential viral transmissibility. Insisting that access to certain venues and activities are limited to the fully jabbed might indeed imply a negative judgment, but surely avoiding this possible offence is much less important than protecting the national community as a whole? Dr Bill Jones Beverley, Yorkshire • John Harris risks oversimplifying people’s understanding of why some of us – around five million adults according to his article – remain unvaccinated in the UK. While there is plenty of evidence that people from particular communities mistrust the public institutions that wish to see them vaccinated, this certainly isn’t the case for all five million of us. As a white, middle-class public servant, I can’t really be considered “historically mistrustful” of institutions, nor am I reckless, but I do have my own sincerely held reasons for not wanting to be vaccinated, none of which are derived from “online cults”. Actually, I don’t want judgment or empathy, I just want there to be safe spaces for debate to take place, where people need not fear being labelled cranks. This includes within national newspapers like the Guardian. As it is, Mr Harris merely continues to promote the prevailing discourse – that in an ideal world everybody would be vaccinated.

141;141;5383;5383;Poverty, inequality and corruption: why Kazakhstan’s former leader is no longer untouchable ;2022-01-05T18:06:43Z;['Shaun Walker'];['Kazakhstan', 'South and central Asia', 'World news', 'Nursultan Nazarbayev'];"For years, Nursultan Nazarbayev has been used to performative adoration from the citizens of Kazakhstan. The country’s leader for nearly three decades, he was showered with praise and adulation at showpiece events, and his image smiled down from billboards across the country.
When he stepped down in 2019, he was able to choose his successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, and kept significant power as head of the security council and general behind-the-scenes powerbroker. He retained his official title of Elbasy, or leader of the nation. Astana, the capital city he ordered built in the heart of the Kazakh steppe, was even renamed in his honour. To Nazarbayev, it must have seemed like he had found an answer to the problem vexing ageing autocrats across the region: how to step aside in old age without risking retribution. Vladimir Putin and others were doubtless watching with interest. The events of the past few days might suggest that different lessons should be drawn. Statues of Nazarbayev, meant to be monuments to his legacy, have been torn down by protesters. Instead of chanting “Elbasy”, many angry Kazakh protesters are now chanting “Shal ket” – or “Old man, out!” Discontent at poverty, inequality and corruption led to increasing unrest in the country in recent years, and much of the anger is directed at Nazarbayev himself, who for so long appeared untouchable. Among Central Asia’s vicious and repressive autocrats, Nazarbayev always seemed the most nimble. Born in 1940, he rose through the ranks of the Communist party and became Kazakhstan’s first leader on independence. He managed to hold the country together during the 1990s, and later to avoid the extreme repressive violence of his peers in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, while also avoiding the revolutionary sentiment of Kyrgyzstan. When 16 people were killed in 2011 protests, he solicited advice from Tony Blair about how best to spin the violence. He charted a delicate geopolitical course in the years after Kazakh independence, remaining friendly towards Russia, while also courting western leaders and energy companies, who turned a blind eye to the lack of democracy and instead focused on securing lucrative contracts in the country. Western lawyers, accountants and advisers helped the new Kazakh elite invest their fortunes in London mansions and Swiss villas. His daughter and grandson are believed to own £80m of London property. Nazarbayev also engaged a steady stream of western architects and urban planners to build his new capital city. In 2010, Nazarbayev, perhaps with one eye on the clock, ordered scientists to investigate the creation of an “elixir” that could prolong human life. Eventually, it seems, he accepted the inevitability of the human ageing process and announced in 2019 he was stepping aside. Last year, the director Oliver Stone made a hagiographic film portrait about Nazarbayev’s time in office, named Qazaq: History of the Golden Man, and numerous statues to the retired leader were erected across the country. Now, his image has become a lightning rod for discontent.

Your article presents the salutary examples of countries such as France, which imposed a mask mandate on all pupils over 11 last November, and Belgium, which since December has required all pupils over six to be masked. However, as an educational comparativist usually based in Japan, I read reports like this while inwardly screaming: “What about east Asia?” There has been some lurid coverage in the UK press of China’s draconian lockdowns. But we see very little discussion of the very different cases of Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, which have managed the pandemic far more effectively than their western counterparts, and with far less disruption to schooling. This is especially so in Japan, where all primary and secondary pupils have worn masks at school (including in the classroom) since the onset of the pandemic. During that time, Japanese pupils have missed a total of just four to five weeks of face-to-face teaching. Edward Vickers Kyushu University, Japan; visiting professor, UCL Institute of Education • In light of the reintroduction of face coverings to secondary school classrooms this week, it is of course true to say teenagers are resilient, demonstrating endless adaptability. But spare a thought for deaf schoolchildren who can’t lip-read or understand facial expressions when face masks are being worn. They have faced challenge upon challenge since the start of the pandemic, isolating during everyday life, facing cancelled exams and enduring online lessons without subtitles. Thousands of deaf secondary-aged pupils will be filled with a sense of dread about the reintroduction of face coverings in class as they return to school. Public health should always be prioritised, but deaf children’s inclusion in society matters too. We cannot continue to see deaf children falling behind their classmates and their mental health suffering where a few simple adjustments and more sensitivity from the public would make all the difference.

143;143;5385;5385;Italian mafia fugitive arrested in Spain after Google Street View sighting ;2022-01-05T18:05:25Z;['Angela Giuffrida'];['Mafia', 'World news', 'Italy', 'Spain', 'Europe', 'Google Maps', 'Technology', 'Google Street View', 'Google', 'Mapping technologies'];An Italian mafia boss on the run for 20 years was tracked down to a Spanish town after being spotted on Google Street View. Gioacchino Gammino, a convicted murderer listed among Italy’s most wanted gangsters, was arrested in Galapagar, a town near Madrid, where over the years he had married, changed his name to Manuel, worked as a chef and owned a fruit and vegetable shop. Sicilian police carried out several investigations in their search for Gammino, 61, and a European arrest warrant was issued in 2014. The fugitive was traced to Spain, but it was Google Street View that helped to pinpoint his precise location. The navigation tool, accessible through Google Maps, had captured an image of two men chatting outside a fruit and vegetable shop called El Huerto de Manu, or Manu’s Garden, in Galapagar. Police believed one of the men closely resembled Gammino, but his identity was only confirmed when they came across a listing for a nearby restaurant called La Cocina de Manu or Manu’s Kitchen. The shop and the restaurant are now closed, but the police found a photo of Gammino, dressed in his chef’s garb, on a still-existing Facebook page for La Cocina de Manu. He was recognisable by the scar on the left side of his chin. The restaurant’s menu included a dish called Cena Siciliana or Sicilian dinner. Gammino was arrested on 17 December but the details surrounding his capture did not come to light until they were reported by La Repubblica on Wednesday. The details were confirmed by the Palermo prosecutor Francesco Lo Voi, who led the latest investigation. “It’s not as if we spend our days wading through Google Maps to find fugitives,” he told the Guardian. “There were many previous and long investigations, which led us to Spain. We were on a good path, with Google Maps helping to confirm our investigations.” After 20 years in hiding, Gammino thought he had managed to sever all his ties with Sicily. Upon his arrest, he reportedly told police: “How did you find me? I haven’t even called my family for 10 years!” Gammino belonged to a mafia clan in Agrigento, Sicily, which was caught up in a bloody feud with Cosa Nostra, Sicily’s main mafia network, in the 1990s. He was first arrested in 1984, when he was investigated by the anti-mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, who was assassinated by the mafia in a car bomb in 1992. Gammino was wanted for murder and various other mafia-related crimes. He was arrested for a second time in Barcelona in 1998. He had been serving a life sentence at Rebibbia prison in Rome when, in 2002, he managed to escape during the commotion of the making of a film at the prison. It is not the first time a mafia fugitive has been caught with the help of the web. In March last year, Mark Feren Claude Biart was captured in the Caribbean after appearing in YouTube cooking videos. Biart had been on the run since 2014, when Italian prosecutors ordered his arrest for trafficking cocaine in the Netherlands on behalf of the Cacciola clan of the ’Ndrangheta mafia. Until his arrest, Biart had been leading a quiet life among the Italian expat community in Boca Chica in the Dominican Republic. Although the YouTube videos of him flaunting his cooking skills never showed his face, police said he was betrayed by the distinctive tattoos on his body. In 2019, police arrested a mobster with the Camorra mafia organisation while he was eating pasta with his two cats sitting beside him in an apartment in the outskirts of Naples.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/italian-mafia-fugitive-arrested-in-spain-after-google-maps-sighting;6

145;145;5387;5387;US sanctions Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik for ‘destabilizing activities’;2022-01-05T18:00:36Z;['Julian Borger'];['Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'US foreign policy', 'Europe', 'World news', 'US news'];"The US has imposed new sanctions on the Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, a television station under his control and two other officials for “significant corruption and destabilizing activities”. The sanctions, involving asset freezes and visa bans, follow Dodik’s threat to withdraw Serbs from the Bosnian national army and other state-level institutions, potentially destroying the 1995 Dayton peace treaty and opening the way for a return to conflict.
Official statements accompanying the sanctions focus on the corruption which US officials say underpin Dodik’s political posturing. “His divisive ethno-nationalistic rhetoric reflects his efforts to advance these political goals and distract attention from his corrupt activities,” a Treasury statement said. “Cumulatively, these actions threaten the stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of BiH and undermine the Dayton Peace Accords, thereby risking wider regional instability.” It said Dodik had handed government contracts and monopolies in the Serb-run half of Bosnia, Republika Srpska (RS) to close business associates. “With his corrupt proceeds, Dodik has engaged in bribery and additional corrupt activities to further his personal interests at the expense of citizens in the RS,” the Treasury said. Dodik has already been sanctioned in 2017, for obstruction of the Dayton accord. The new measures are wider, criminalizing financial donations to him, and targeting Alternativna Televizija, a television station based in Banja Luka, the biggest town in the RS. The channel is privately owned by a company closely linked to Dodik’s family, the Treasury said, and operates as Dodik’s personal propaganda outlet. “Dodik has awarded ATV-related contracts directly to members of his family, which he has used as yet another avenue for corruption,” the Treasury said. “He has funneled money directly from public companies to ATV for corrupt purposes.” Dodik shrugged off the sanctions telling a local media outlet: “If they think that they will discipline me like this, they are grossly mistaken.” A Dodik adviser, Milan Tegeltija, was also banned from entering the US. The US secretary of state, Tony Blinken, said Tegeltija had used his former role as head of the state-level judiciary for “corrupt acts that included using his political influence and official power for his personal benefit”. A Bosnian Muslim, or Bosniak, party leader, Mirsad Kukić, was also targeted in Wednesday’s sanction. He is accused of using his role as manager of the publicly owned Banovici mine and his seat in parliament to use “political influence and official power for his personal benefit”.
Although the effect on sanctions on Dodik are reduced by his limited financial exposure in the US, Daniel Serwer, a former US special envoy to Bosnia, said they still represent a setback for Dodik. “They do have a psychological impact. The question of how strong the financial impact is,” Serwer said. “Basically this prevents designated individuals from international financial transactions, almost all of which go through the US in one fashion or another.” He added: “The sanctions, in addition to targeting Dodik and Alternativa, are a warning to other politicians and companies, who may have more to fear than Dodik.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/us-sanctions-bosnian-serb-leader-milorad-dodik;1

But when this latest version of the plague drops off the front pages, another story is set to take its place – and this one will hang around for most of the year, setting the terms of trade at Westminster and possibly deciding Boris Johnson’s future. The cost of living is about to shape our politics in a way that it hasn’t for decades. You can spot the buildup this week, from Keir Starmer’s warning of a crisis to Tory backbenchers clamouring for Johnson to act now on high fuel bills. And you can already see the misery in the stories about how Britons now wrap themselves up in blankets and turn on their hairdryers to keep warm, rather than run the central heating. Over the next few weeks, the crisis will only grow. On 7 February the energy watchdog, Ofgem, sets the new maximum price for energy bills. Utility firm bosses are warning that the cap could easily go above £2,000, twice what it was last winter. Experts at the National Energy Action charity have warned that fuel poverty could rise to its highest levels since John Major was in No 10, with about 6 million households having to choose between heating and eating, or paying the bus fare or buying sanitary pads. This means 2 million households, which as recently as last autumn were still keeping their heads above water, will sink when the new cap kicks in on 1 April. At just that point, taxes go up too. National insurance will rise, as will council tax across much of the country, alongside a stealth increase in income tax bills. Put all that together and the Resolution Foundation warns that the average household stands to lose an extra £1,200 a year. To this we can add the effect of higher petrol prices. These bills will pile up while wages and benefits are falling in real terms. It is a recipe for widespread deprivation and massive political turbulence. It also blows apart the electoral coalition that handed Johnson his landslide. In true-blue Woking, only 6% of households are in fuel poverty; in Workington, by contrast, which went Tory only in 2019, that proportion is nearly 14%. My bet has long been that boring old economics will inflict far more damage on Boris Johnson than baroque politics. Most critics of the Sun King have spent the days since 2019 attacking his rule-breaking, his brinkmanship with Brussels, his sheer bad behaviour. Until the revelations about the parties at No 10, hardly any of it landed with a public that is wearily well used to a political class trashing norms to fill its boots; just ask the Right Hon Member for Greensill Capital. But all those voters, left unmoved by 42-point headlines and stinging op-eds, are far more likely to be mobilised by the largest tax burden in 70 years, swingeing cuts to frontline services and surging inflation. No wonder the government can barely quell its anxiety. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has been meeting energy bosses in a series of emergency summits, the latest held on Wednesday, while Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s team has been grumbling to journalists about having to stump up for any of this. Still, with only a month to go before the Ofgem announcement, no deal is on the table. What’s odd is that Johnson has himself pledged one such remedy. Co-writing an article in the Sun less than a month before the EU referendum of 2016, he vowed that Brexit would mean the end of VAT on fuel bills. “We will be able to scrap this unfair and damaging tax,” Mr Leave wrote . “It isn’t right that unelected bureaucrats in Brussels impose taxes on the poorest and elected British politicians can do nothing.” A whole two and a half years since becoming prime minister, he has done precisely nothing. This week he squirmed on TV that cutting VAT was a “blunt instrument” that wouldn’t direct help towards those in most dire financial need. Fancy that! If only someone had warned us that this guy reneges on a deal. But if Starmer wants to capitalise on this moment, he needs to do far better than make nothingy speeches larded with abstract nouns and bedecked with flags. Labour wants to scrap the 5% VAT rate on energy bills, but in truth it’s small change: £10 back on a £200 monthly bill. Better would be to call for a windfall tax on gas and oil companies, which have been making a killing as fuel prices rise, and direct that money to the least well-off. If Labour can take that position early and loud enough, they’ll reap rewards when the Tories copy them. They can also point to the failures of the energy market – the collapse of 26 suppliers and the consolidation of their customer base back into the hands of the big six – as grounds to try something new: to use the public sector to direct more investment into nationally secure renewables. This is a generation of politicians that has never faced an inflation shock but is nevertheless haunted by the mythology around what happened in the 1970s. With good reason: Thatcher used that episode finally to dismantle the Keynesian welfare state and to exile the left for more than a decade. The right is already reheating those old arguments about how inflation and higher interest rates must mean reduced public spending, and how taxpayers don’t want to pay for “green crap” and reducing poverty. It is essential that the left counter those points now. This isn’t the 70s, and there is no danger of a wage-price spiral. This is a workforce that has just emerged from the worst squeeze on living standards since Napoleon marched across Europe – and it is just about to enter another one. It’s not the labour force that isn’t working: it’s the markets and the supply chain. Those are what need to be fixed.

148;148;5390;5390;John Salt obituary;2022-01-05T17:44:28Z;['Simon Chapman'];['Painting', 'Art', 'Art and design', 'Photography', 'Birmingham', 'US news'];"John Salt, who has died aged 84, was a pioneer of photorealist painting, a genre that emerged in late 1960s America, in part, like its predecessor pop art, as a response to abstract expressionism. The paintings were of photographs of random subjects, enlarged and rendered in such detail that they themselves could be mistaken for photographs. John was British but, while living in the US, and painting photographs of cars and trailer homes, he became identified with the American photorealist movement. Like other artists around the same time, John chose the photograph as his subject matter because there was no preconceived idea of how it should be represented. When looking at one of John’s paintings it is not his picture of a car, but his picture of a photograph of a car, that we see. The more photograph-like the painting, the more essential it is to view the painting itself, rather than a reproduction, in order to assess, for instance, scale, colour and texture. Within three years of having arrived in the US John joined Ivan Karp at his newly opened OK Harris gallery in New York in 1970, and with Karp’s encouragement John’s career took off. For the next 25 years, he showed regularly in New York and across the US and Europe. John was among the photorealists included in the 1972 Documenta 5 exhibition in Germany, where the curator Harald Szeemann introduced photorealism to Europe.
Photorealism conveyed the everyday and derived from its source material a sense of the chance configuration of captured moments. It was dismissed by US critics as shallow, in that beyond the technical prowess required to produce a painting identical to a photograph, there remained little of interest – and limited imagination and a minimal knowledge of art was needed to appreciate it. In the UK, photorealism was similarly received by the art establishment. Apart from a 1973 group show at the Serpentine Gallery in London, curated by the critic and writer Lawrence Alloway, there were few exhibitions of photorealist work until 1975, when John had his first major UK solo show in his hometown of Birmingham, at the Ikon Gallery, where I was then the director. Soon afterwards, John and his family returned to the UK to live in rural Shropshire. Despite the physical distance he continued to paint predominantly American imagery. John was born in Birmingham, the only child of Amy (nee Evans) and Cyril Salt, who ran a garage. He studied at Birmingham School of Art (1952-57) at the same time as Peter Phillips and John Walker, under Gilbert Mason and Kate Fryer, and when strong drawing and technical skills were prerequisites for a career as an artist. He went on to the Slade School of Art in London (1958-60), under William Coldstream. His work then was abstract and frequently in collage, with influences from Francis Bacon, Prunella Clough and Alan Davie. He was drawn to work by Jim Dine, James Rosenquist and Robert Rauschenberg and out of this interest arose an ambition to see the US. Shortly after he married Jean Arnold, a science teacher, in 1967, the couple decided to spend a couple of years in the US. John was offered a scholarship for the master’s programme at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, which also included a paid teaching post. The head of its graduate school was the abstract expressionist painter Grace Hartigan, who became John’s mentor and, together with the figurative artist Alex Katz, she was largely responsible for encouraging him to remain in the US. It was at this time that John’s new work, using images from car sales brochures and later 35mm colour transparencies, emerged. Using handcut lace-like paper stencils and a spray gun, he produced paintings of wrecked and abandoned cars and trailer homes. John’s work became recognised as among the most sensitively produced of that first wave of this new school. In 2014 OK Harris closed and John joined the Louis K Meisel gallery in New York. His work was included in Picturing America: Photorealism in the 1970s, at the Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin in 2009, and Photorealism: 50 years of Hyperrealistic Painting, which travelled to several European cities, including Birmingham, in 2013. He continued painting until 2018 when failing health – including dementia and parkinsonism – began to take its toll. He leaves a body of work that, according to Linda Chase, author of John Salt: The Complete Works 1969-2006 (2007), “transmogrifies the ugly into the beautiful, the discarded into the treasured, and gives us new eyes with which to view and appreciate our world. These paintings impress with their mastery and verisimilitude but continue to engage with their mystery.” John is survived by Jean and their daughter, Katy, son, Thomas, and four grandchildren. • John Salt, artist, born 2 August 1937; died 13 December 2021";https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/05/john-salt-obituary;5

She was a devout Catholic and followed the words often attributed to Mother Teresa: “If you want to change the world, go home and love your family.” Born Ann Dalton in Cabra, Dublin, but always known as Maureen, she was one of nine children of Annie (nee Foy) and Michael Dalton, a tailor. Two siblings died in infancy and her mother died when Maureen was 10. Maureen was educated in Dublin. She was always fiercely protective of her siblings. According to family legend, once, when her sister Carmel was bullied at school aged eight, Maureen, just a year or two older, confronted the perpetrators. At the age of 18 she contracted tuberculosis and spent three years in isolation. After recovering, in the late 1950s Maureen joined thousands who moved from Ireland to London in search of work. She took various jobs, including, for a time, at a chocolate factory. In 1960, while visiting her brother, Maureen went to the Queen Adelaide pub, Shepherd’s Bush, where she met the head barman, a quiet Waterford man named Tony Byrne. They married in 1960 and settled in Wood Green. Tony worked as a cleaner on the London Underground. Maureen and Tony had five children. When they had all started school she went to work part-time at Zetters football pools in Clerkenwell. As the children grew up and married, Maureen loved their wives, husbands and partners as though they were her own. She went to St Paul’s Catholic church in Wood Green for more than 60 years and made many friends in the Irish community. At the local community centre Maureen joined other women of a similar age; they encouraged each other to take up exercise and they all enjoyed the companionship on offer. Maureen was an avid watcher of Coronation Street and Emmerdale, and a fan of Catherine Cookson novels. She loved to entertain people and to make them laugh, enjoyed a pint of lager, and had a keen sense of mischief. When asked by a grandchild why she never went to confession, Maureen responded: “I have never sinned, so I have nothing to confess.” In recent years Maureen had suffered from thyroid illness and diabetes, and underwent heart surgery. She was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2018. She never lost her zest for life or her sense of fun.

150;150;5392;5392;Nobel winner Pablo Neruda was almost denied prize because of odes to Stalin;2022-01-05T17:28:24Z;['Alison Flood'];['Pablo Neruda', 'Nobel prize in literature', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Awards and prizes', 'World news', 'Poetry', 'Chile'];"Pablo Neruda may have won the Nobel prize for literature in 1971, but newly opened archives in Stockholm reveal the judging panel’s concerns about the Chilean poet’s “communist tendencies”. The list of writers in the running for the Nobel prize, and the deliberations of the secretive members of the judging panel at the Swedish Academy, are kept confidential for 50 years. But the newly opened archives show that, although 1971’s winner Neruda was praised by the prize-givers for “a poetry that with the action of an elemental force brings alive a continent’s destiny and dreams”, behind the scenes some members of the Swedish Academy were hesitant. They questioned how works such as Neruda’s odes to Stalin fitted with Alfred Nobel’s stipulation that the prize go to “the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction” – according to journalist Kaj Schueler, who researched the Swedish Academy’s documents from 1971 for the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. While the Nobel committee chair Anders Österling praised Neruda’s “poetic natural power and dynamic vitality”, he questioned whether “the increasingly dominant communist tendency in his poetry is compatible with the purpose of the Nobel prize”. Neruda, known for his passionate, romantic poetry, was also a leftwing politician and diplomat, and close friend of President Salvador Allende. Neruda died days after Augusto Pinochet’s military coup in 1973, under circumstances that have since been investigated. “A writer’s way of thinking – whether Marxist, syndicalist, anarchist or something else – belongs to his free right. However, Neruda is fully politically involved, including through his hymns to Stalin and other purely propagandistic achievements. On that basis, I have reservations about his candidacy, without, however, wanting to firmly reject it in advance,” wrote Österling in 1963 – an opinion that he continued to hold in 1971, according to Schueler.
Österling had previously spoken out against the candidacy of Ezra Pound because he “propagates ideas of a nature that is definitely contrary to the spirit of the Nobel prize”, and Samuel Beckett, because of his nihilism. Österling was eventually persuaded of Neruda’s merits, and Beckett won the prize in 1969, but Pound never did. The opening of the archives also shows that WH Auden, James Baldwin, Philip Larkin and Jorge Luis Borges were all nominated for the 1971 award. Auden made the shortlist, along with Patrick White, André Malraux and Eugenio Montale. White (in 1973) and Montale (1975) would later win, but Malraux and Auden never did.

151;151;5393;5393;A tough year ahead for public sector wages | Letter;2022-01-05T17:24:38Z;['N/A'];['Public sector pay', 'Pay', 'Consumer affairs', 'Office for National Statistics', 'Business', 'Money', 'UK news', 'Inflation', 'Economics', 'Family finances'];The forthcoming economic crisis analysed by the Resolution Foundation (UK households warned of ‘year of the squeeze’ as cost of living soars, 29 December) is partly based on a view that wage growth is stagnant. This is true for a wide range of employees but not necessarily for all. In fact, earnings growth in the year to October was 4.9%, matching consumer price index inflation, in part buoyed up by labour market shortages. If we follow the Office for National Statistics’ breakdown of sectors, average earnings in the private sector grew by 5.4% in the year to October, while in the public sector the growth rate was 2.7%. So 2022 is set to be yet another tough year for public sector employees. Further analysis of the different parts of the private sector shows average earnings growing by 7.7% in the finance and business services sector, contrasting with a low rate of 2.8% in manufacturing. Pay growth for some is quite strong, while for others it is very weak and certainly below the rate of inflation.

152;152;5394;5394;Covid ‘vaccination doubt line’ receiving up to 1,000 calls a day in Netherlands;2022-01-05T17:18:25Z;['Jon Henley'];['Coronavirus', 'Netherlands', 'Europe', 'Infectious diseases'];"A “vaccination doubt line” set up by doctors in the Netherlands is receiving up to 1,000 calls a day from people who are still unsure whether or not they should get jabbed against the coronavirus. The helpline, originally launched as a local service in November by Robin Peeters, an endocrinologist at the Erasmus medical centre in Rotterdam, and Shakib Sana, a GP, was given a national number last month and has been inundated with inquiries. Staffed mainly by volunteer medical students from rooms made available in the university hospitals of Utrecht, Amsterdam, Nijmegen, Maastricht and Rotterdam, the service has met “an extraordinary response”, Peeters said. He told the Dutch public broadcaster NOS that there appeared to be more “doubters” than anti-vaxxers among the unvaccinated population. “The more you can help people come to a decision and limit hospital admissions, the better,” he said. Peeters said callers to the line, which is open from 8.30am to 4.30pm, fell into three main categories. First, those with questions about their individual medical situation: whether the jab would make their migraines worse, or interact with their medication. There were also a large number of questions about pregnancy and fertility and Covid-19 vaccines, as well as possible side-effects. The answers to many such specific questions could not be found on government information websites, he said. “The strength of a telephone helpline is that people can call anonymously and ask independent medical professionals,” he said. “People get their information from all sorts of unreliable sources, so there’s a need for independent advice.”
Before Christmas the line received 4,400 calls over five days, Dutch media have reported. The students log every question they receive, and have access to a database containing fully referenced answers to the most common queries. Whenever they are unsure about an answer, they can contact specialists such as immunologists, gynaecologists and allergists – for more specific information. “The aim is to give every caller an appropriate and correct answer,” Peeters said. Conversations with the few committed anti-vaxxers who call are kept as short as possible, with the students trained to always ask whether the caller has a specific medical question. If not, they move on to the next caller. The objective is expressly not to pressure anyone into getting vaccinated, Peeters told the Gelderlander newspaper. “We want them to come to their own decision – we just want them to base it on correct information,” he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/covid-vaccination-doubt-line-receiving-up-to-1000-calls-a-day-in-the-netherlands;7
153;153;5395;5395;Audiences to be put in hypnotic trance at Swedish film festival;2022-01-05T17:15:43Z;['Catherine Shoard'];['Film', 'Sweden', 'Culture', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Festivals', 'Apichatpong Weerasethakul', 'Psychology'];"The Göteborg film festival is no stranger to stunts. It has previously featured screenings for a single audience member at a North Sea lighthouse, as well as “coffin screenings” in which lucky viewers were interred inside a sarcophagus to enhance their sensory empathy. This year, festival directors are planning to put the entire audience under by hiring a hypnotist for three gala screenings. Ahead of Swedish premieres for Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s Memoria, Shirin Neshat’s Land of Dreams and Christian Tafdrup’s Speak No Evil, a hypnotist will appear on stage to “transform the audience’s state of mind in accordance with the mood and theme of the film”. Organisers said the spell would be broken after the screening. They did not comment on what would happen if the hypnotist became unavailable between the opening or closing credits – or what the effect would be on audience members who might, for instance, need to access the bathroom during the film.
Memoria, whose running time is nearly three hours, is the most prominent among the films: a near dialogue-free English language debut for its Thai director with Tilda Swinton playing seemingly the only person on Earth able to hear new sonic booms. Göteborg artistic director Jonas Holmberg explained that the experiment was intended to “raise questions about submission, transgression and control” made more pertinent during the pandemic. “Watching a film in the cinema can be extremely hypnotic,” he added. ““At home, with a tablet, it is much harder to maintain the focus you need to get really absorbed by a film. The Hypnotic Cinema is both a tribute to and an extension of the experience of watching films at the movie theatre.” The Goteborg film festival runs for 10 days from 28 January.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/audiences-to-be-put-in-hypnotic-trance-at-swedish-film-festival;5
154;154;5396;5396;Tigrayans deported by Saudis ‘forcibly disappeared’ in Ethiopia – rights group;2022-01-05T17:10:08Z;['Katie McQue'];['Human rights', 'Global development', 'Migration', 'World news', 'Ethiopia', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Africa', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'Conflict and arms'];"Thousands of Tigrayans are being deported from Saudi Arabia and held in secret detention sites in Ethiopia, according to Human Rights Watch. In a new report, the international rights organisation says it has identified two detention sites where thousands of people from the war-torn Tigray region of Ethiopia are being mistreated and forcibly disappeared. The sites, identified via satellite imagery, videos and witness accounts, in the towns of Semera and Shone are most likely used to detain Tigrayan deportees, HRW said. The HRW report also includes testimony from returnees who claim that they were abused and beaten while in custody in Saudi Arabia.
“Tigrayan migrants who have experienced horrific abuse in Saudi custody are being locked up in detention facilities upon returning to Ethiopia,” said Nadia Hardman, refugee and migrant rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Saudi Arabia should offer protection to Tigrayans at risk, while Ethiopia should release all arbitrarily detained Tigrayan deportees,” she said. Hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians have migrated over the past decade, travelling by boat across the Red Sea and then by land through Yemen to Saudi Arabia. The causes of this migration include conflict, economic hardship, drought and human rights abuses. In January 2021, the Ethiopian government announced it would cooperate in the repatriation of 40,000 of its nationals detained in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of the returnees from Saudi Arabia between November 2020 and June 2021 were Tigrayan, according to HRW. The 23 Tigrayans interviewed for the report are undocumented migrant workers who were rounded up in Saudi Arabia and say they were also subjected to abuses there, including beatings and overcrowding. Many spent up to six years in formal and informal detention facilities in the kingdom. After being deported to Ethiopia, they were held in facilities throughout the country, HRW said: in centres across Addis Ababa; in Semera, Afar region; in Shone, in a state known as Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ region; and in Jimma, Oromia region. Trhas*, a 33-year-old Tigrayan woman who was deported from Saudi Arabia in December 2020, told HRW that Ethiopian federal police stopped her at a checkpoint at Awash Sebat, Afar, and put her on a bus to what she describes as a “military camp” in Shone. “We asked the federal police for food and water and the toilet, but we were beaten if we left our seats,” she said, describing the 36-hour bus ride to the camp. “They said, ‘Bandits don’t need food.’” In 2021, the Guardian exposed Saudi Arabia’s mass mistreatment of undocumented African migrants, exacerbated by the pandemic, at al-Shumaisi detention centre near Jeddah. Detainees interviewed at the time said they were subjected to a litany of abuses including insufficient food and water, unsanitary conditions, denial of medical care, and extortion by the centre’s guards.
Nearly all interviewees said that Saudi authorities had arrested and detained them because of their irregular immigration status, but that the authorities did not provide legal justifications for their detention, nor allow them access to a lawyer or to challenge their detention. Prolonged detention without access to judicial review violates international law. Saudi Arabia is not party to the United Nations’ Convention on Refugees, and has long drawn international criticism for not having an asylum system. “Saudi Arabia should stop contributing to this abuse by ending the forced return of Tigrayans to Ethiopia and allowing them to seek asylum or resettlement in third countries,” said Hardman.
A conflict in the Tigray region, in Northern Ethiopia, between Ethiopian federal government and allied forces and those affiliated with the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) began in November 2020. Since then, rights groups and the media have documented numerous abuses including massacres, mass displacement, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests and blocking of humanitarian relief. The Saudi Arabian government’s Centre for International Communication and the Ethiopian government’s Communication Service did not respond to requests for comment. *Names in the HRW report have been changed to protect the identity of those interviewed.

155;155;5397;5397;Path of resistance: a timeline of protest against Edward Colston;2022-01-05T17:07:49Z;['Damien Gayle'];['Protest', 'Colonialism', 'UK news', 'British empire', 'Bristol', 'Race', 'Slavery'];"1636: Edward Colston is born into a merchant family in Bristol. In 1680 he becomes becomes a leading shareholder in the Royal African Company, which has a monopoly in the trade in enslaved people. He dies in 1721, having donated about £70,000 – equivalent to millions in today’s money – to Bristol, helping to establish a number of the city’s oldest institutions. 1895: A statue of Colston is erected in Bristol “by popular subscription”. A plaque attached to its plinth says: “Erected by the citizens of Bristol as a memorial to one of the most virtuous and wise sons of their city.” Attempts to raise money for the memorial from Bristolians are largely unsuccessful and the monument ends up being financed by the wealthy Bristol publisher James Williams Arrowsmith.
1921: Rev H J Wilkins publishes a short book based on archival research that acknowledges Colston as a slave trader. Wilkins is the first in the modern era to question the image built around Colston and to ask if such veneration is appropriate for a man who traded in human beings. 1973: In response to historical silence surrounding the 600th anniversary of Bristol as a city and county, Derek Robinson writes A Shocking History of Bristol, exposing Colston as a leading financier of the slave trade and drawing attention to his continued celebration in annual rituals. May 1996: Complaints pour in after Bristol’s Festival of the Sea fails almost entirely to mention the city’s role in the slave trade, with multicultural arts groups launching a counter Anti-Festival of the Sea. The Bristol trip hop band Massive Attack announce they are boycotting Colston Hall over its association with the slave trader. January 1998: The first direct action against the Colston statue takes place, with “fuck off slave trader” painted on the statue overnight in red paint. Days later a Bristol councillor, Ray Sefia, said he could understand why the statue was targeted. “It’s like having a monument to Hitler,” he told the Bristol Post. “We have to be very clear about Colston’s role in the slave trade.”
September-October 2007: Protests outside Colston Hall are orchestrated by activists angry at the venue being used to host events celebrating the bicentenary of the end of the slave trade. The protests, some months after renewed calls by civil rights campaigners to rename the hall, come as a number of public debates are held re-examining Colston’s legacy. July 2018: Bristol council agrees to attach a new plaque to the Colston statue to make clear his “active role in the enslavement of over 84,000 Africans”. However, after an intervention by Bristol’s Society of Merchant Venturers, the wording of the plaque is watered down. Bristol’s mayor, Marvin Rees, responds to the re-wording by blocking its installation. October 2018: The Bristol MP Thangam Debbonaire calls for the removal of the statue of Edward Colston. Days later an art installation made up of concrete figures depicting enslaved Africans packed into a slave ship appears in front of the statue of Colston. 25 May 2020: A Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneels on the neck of George Floyd, an African American man, for eight minutes and 40 seconds until Floyd is dead. The murder, which is captured on video, sparks worldwide anti-racist protests under the banner of Black Lives Matter. 7 June 2020: The statue of Colston is pulled from its plinth, rolled to Bristol harbour and thrown into the River Avon by a crowd of thousands taking part in a Black Lives Matter protest. In the following days, Colston girls’ school removes a half-size replica of the statue, his name is removed from buildings in Bristol and his likeness taken from church stained glass windows. In London the mayor, Sadiq Khan, orders a review of statues connected with slavery in the capital. 25 January 2021: Jake Skuse, Rhian Graham, Milo Ponsford and Sage Willoughby are charged with damaging the statue and plinth “with each other and others unknown without lawful excuse”. 13 December 2021: The Colston 4 go on trial at Bristol crown court accused of criminal damage. 5 January 2022: All four defendants are cleared of criminal damage after jurors are urged by the defence to “be on the right side of history”.

156;156;5398;5398;Top EU diplomat offers full support to Ukraine on visit to conflict frontline;2022-01-05T17:06:23Z;['Jennifer Rankin', 'Julian Borger'];['World news', 'Ukraine', 'European Union', 'Foreign policy', 'Russia', 'Vladimir Putin'];"The European Union’s top diplomat has pledged “full support” to Ukraine on a visit to the frontline of the country’s war with Moscow-backed separatists. Josep Borrell is the first EU high representative for foreign policy to have visited the Donbass region since war broke out nearly eight years ago. “We are here first to reaffirm European Union’s full support to Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he told journalists. “Any military aggression against Ukraine will have messy consequences and severe costs,” he said, echoing recent declarations of EU leaders. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who accompanied Borrell on a helicopter trip to the Luhansk region, hailed the visit as historic. It was, he said, a “sign of Ukraine-EU unity in the face of elevated Russian threats”.
Borrell visited Stanytsia Luhanska, a village and crossing point on the frontline that has endured years of shelling in the conflict with Russian-backed separatists. Tensions have escalated as tens of thousands of Russian troops have massed along the border with Ukraine. “The conflict on the borders is on the verge of getting deeper and tensions have been building up with regard to European security as a whole,” Borrell said. The EU has been searching for a role in the conflict before a series of crucial meetings next week aiming to reduce the temperature between Moscow and the west. Officials from Russia and the US will gather in Geneva next Monday, followed by a Nato-Russia council two days later, with talks then moving to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
Meanwhile Germany has stepped up its own diplomacy. Berlin is sending German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s foreign policy adviser, Jens Plötner, to Moscow, and on Wednesday, the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, met the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in Washington to present a common front on Ukraine. “We jointly reiterated that Russian actions and activities come with a clear price tag, and a renewed violation of Ukrainian sovereignty by Russia would have severe consequences,” Baerbock said. She did not specifically address the question of whether the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project would be blocked in the event of a Ukrainian invasion, but did say Germany would abide by an agreement with the US last summer that Russia would not be allowed to use energy as a political weapon against Europe. “We agreed on this, together with our European partners, that we would take effective measures together with our European partners, should Russia use energy as a weapon or should it continue its aggressive acts against Ukraine,” Baerbock said. Blinken said the pipeline gave the EU leverage over Russia, rather than the other way round. “If Russia renews its aggression toward Ukraine, it would certainly be difficult to see gas flowing through it in the future,” he said. Paris is dispatching Plötner’s French counterpart, Emmanuel Bonne, to Moscow, while France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, called for close cooperation among Europeans in relations with Russia. “A demanding dialogue with Russia on the basis of parameters that we judge conform to our collective security interests is useful and necessary to reinforce strategic stability in Europe,” he said in a statement issued on Wednesday. Le Drian is due to host EU foreign ministers in Brest next week for further talks on how to handle relations with Moscow. Earlier this year, France and Germany provoked fury among other EU members by calling for a summit with Vladimir Putin. Poland and the Baltic states rejected the idea, arguing it would not change the Russian president’s behaviour. Instead the EU agreed to explore further economic sanctions against Russia, but a paper on that subject drawn up by EU officials is yet to see the light of day. Despite Ukraine’s pleas for preventive sanctions, EU officials oppose revealing any possible actions against Russia, fearing it could deepen tensions. Discussing sanctions would also be likely to exacerbate divisions among EU member states on how to respond to Russia. The EU and US blame Moscow for provoking a crisis by massing tens of thousands of troops at the border with Ukraine and have threatened “massive consequences” if Russia invades. The Kremlin has called for guarantees that Ukraine will never be a Nato member and says the alliance should remove troops and weapons from EU member states bordering Russia, demands dismissed as unacceptable by European leaders.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/top-eu-diplomat-offers-full-support-to-ukraine-on-visit-to-conflict-frontline;1
157;157;5399;5399;Covid hospitalizations among US children soar as schools under pressure;2022-01-05T17:01:16Z;['Melody Schreiber'];['US news', 'Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus', 'US education'];"Covid-19 hospitalizations among children in the US are soaring, fueled by the Omicron variant and the holidays, and adding pressure to already-strained health systems and schools. An average of 672 children were being hospitalized every day in the US, as of 2 January - more than double the average just a week before. And the rate is rapidly increasing.
Cases are also rising. There were more than 325,000 new cases among kids in the week ending 23 December, a 64% increase from the previous week and nearly double the cases two weeks earlier, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported on Monday. The increases appear to be driven by the more contagious nature of the Omicron variant and low vaccination rates among children over the age of five years old. As with adults, early evidence appears to show that Omicron also largely causes mild illness in kids. Nonetheless, experts are urging the use of every possible precaution, including tests, masks, vaccinations and even temporary delays in reopening schools to curb both cases and staff shortages. “We have about four times as many children admitted currently as we have had in any other wave,” Dr Elaine Cox, the chief medical officer for Riley Children’s Health in Indiana, told reporters on Tuesday. They are also seeing the severity rise among the children who are admitted to the hospital, Cox said. “So there are more of them, and they are sicker.” More than half the hospitalized children have had to spend time in the intensive care unit, and at least 40% of those kids need to be put on a ventilator, she said. More than 1,000 kids have died in the US from Covid during the pandemic so far, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More than 830,000 people have died in the US from Covid so far. In New York, hospitalizations among kids quadrupled. In Washington DC, children’s hospital admissions have roughly doubled. In Texas, children’s hospitalizations were described as “staggering”. In Alabama, cases were “like a rocket ship”. In Louisiana, one doctor said: “We’ve never seen anything like it.” In Ohio, one associate professor of internal medicine and pediatrics critical care recently told ABC news: “We’re on fire.” Hospitals are shooting past the peaks of previous surges, many of them driven by the Omicron variant. In South Africa, children and teens accounted for 17% of hospital admissions during the Omicron wave, compared to 4% during the second wave and 3.5% during the third, which was fueled by the Delta variant. Cox said she had also seen a sharp uptick in cases among pregnant people and newborns. In addition to Covid, hospitals are also seeing a dangerous wave of RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and the flu this year, creating a triple threat of respiratory illness. At the same time, health workers are also getting breakthrough infections with Omicron, creating staff shortages. “We have significant numbers of our staff who are becoming ill with Covid, so they can’t work,” Cox said. Indiana is one of the states calling in the national guard to help with hospital care and logistics. School systems across the country are also balancing soaring cases, among students and staff, and weighing virtual options. Leaders of Chicago public schools, the country’s third-largest school network, canceled classes on Wednesday after the teachers’ union voted to switch to remote learning due to the surge in Covid cases. In late December, Joe Biden urged the widespread use of tools to combat the virus, including tests and vaccines. “We can keep our K-through-12 schools open, and that’s exactly what we should be doing,” he said. In Washington DC, which has some of the highest rates of Covid in the country, all students and staff are now required to take a rapid test before returning to school – one of the few districts in the country with this requirement. But schools in neighboring Montgomery county, Maryland, which has also been hit hard with new cases and hospitalizations, are recommending, not requiring, tests for students and staff. Tests have been difficult to find in many places. “We have tools now that we didn’t have last year, that will allow us to keep schools open if we deploy those tools in the best possible way,” said Brian Castrucci, who is the president and CEO of the de Beaumont Foundation, a former state and local health official, and the parent to school-aged kids in Montgomery county. “We’re dealing with trying to make sure that schools are operational, that there are enough bus drivers, there are enough teachers,” Castrucci said. Educators and health officials worry that a return to school during a time of unprecedented spread could lead to the involuntary closure of schools due to staff shortages and contribute to rising cases, especially in places that aren’t able or willing to institute precautions. “It is mind-boggling some states have a [mask] mandate ban, or do not do enough to keep our kids safe,” said Tony Yang, executive director of the Center for Health Policy and Media Engagement at George Washington University, who has researched mask mandates in schools. Yang strongly favors in-person school with precautions in place. “Students should go to school in person,” he said. “But you have to do that safely.” In places where cases are particularly high, even where some precautions are in place, schools could choose to extend winter break to avoid staff shortages during the worst of the January peak, Castrucci said. “The number one thing is, we have to use every resource we have to keep kids in school in person over the long term,” he said. “And right now, we have to make a risk calculation as to whether this is the right moment to bring kids back from the holiday.” Vaccines are another key tool, said Diego Hijano, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at St Jude children’s research hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. “Vaccination matters in terms of hospitalization and outcomes,” he said. Most of the hospitalized kids around the country are unvaccinated, and Hijano had not seen a vaccinated child hospitalized for Covid – even though he works with many children who are at risk because of other medical conditions. Hospitals overwhelmed by Covid can lead to worse care and outcomes for children suffering from other causes, he said. “If a kid has appendicitis and needs a bed for the surgery, they may not get it because the hospital is flooded with Covid,” Hijano said. “As a country and society, we shouldn’t allow even one death that could be prevented.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/covid-hospitalizations-us-children-omicron-schools-hospitals;4

159;159;5401;5401;How Bristol came out in support of the Colston Four;2022-01-05T16:54:26Z;['Damien Gayle'];['Black Lives Matter movement', 'Bristol', 'UK news'];"As long as they live in Bristol, the three men and a woman cleared this week of toppling the statue of Edward Colston may never have to buy their own drinks again. Jake Skuse, 33, Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, played key roles in tearing the statue of the 17th-century slave trader from its city centre plinth, dragging it to Bristol harbour and throwing it in the River Avon. On the first day of their trial last month, hundreds of supporters applauded the Colston Four, as they have come to be known, as they arrived at Bristol crown court. On Wednesday they were found not guilty of damaging the statue, bringing their chapter in the saga to a close. But their actions, considered to be one of the most significant and symbolic acts of public dissent in Britain this century, sent shock waves that are still being felt nationally and globally.
The toppling of Colston – which came just two weeks after the murder of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, sparked antiracist protests around the world – exploded like a cultural hand grenade. It catalysed a nationwide reassessment of the symbols of Britain’s imperialist past. Within six months nearly 70 tributes to slave traders, colonialists and racists were removed across the UK, a Guardian tally found, as conversations intensified over which historical figures were appropriate for public veneration. Reverberations were felt as far away as the US where, at the funeral of Floyd himself, Rev Al Sharpton referenced the protest as symbolic of changing attitudes to race, saying: “I’ve seen grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave masters statue; over in England they put it in the river.” And it triggered outrage on the right. Dozens of so-called “statue defender” protests across the UK culminated in a chaotic rally by football fans around the statue of Winston Churchill in Trafalgar Square. Impassioned commentators compared protesters to a “woke Taliban” and warned of efforts to erase British history. “We cannot now try to edit or censor our past,” the prime minister tweeted. But as much as it was a trigger for a broader debate, the toppling of Colston’s statue was also the culmination of a uniquely Bristolian story. Erected in 1895, 174 years after Colston’s death, the bronze likeness celebrated a man regarded by some as the city’s philanthropic patron saint. He had given his name to three schools in the city and half a dozen roads, and a number of Bristol’s most ancient institutions owed their existence to his largesse. Every year celebrations were held in Bristol cathedral in Colston’s name. Leading pupils from the schools that bore his name were taken on pilgrimages to see a clump of his hair and his nails preserved like relics in the city’s Merchants Hall. A plaque attached to the plinth on which Colston’s statue stood celebrated him as “one of the most virtuous and wise sons” of Bristol. But concerns had long been raised over his presence. Looming over the heart of south-west England’s most multicultural city, Colston had served as a potent reminder that its wealth was raised off the backs of enslaved people. Giving expert evidence in the trial, the historian David Olusoga described how Colston had made his fortune as shareholder, and eventual head, of Britain’s most-important slave-owning enterprise, the Royal African Company. During his tenure, it kidnapped and enslaved an estimated 85,000 Africans, including 12,000 children. “For me, it was symbolic of power and lack of respect, and the position of black people as a community,” Ros Martin, a playwright and activist for many years with the Countering Colston campaign, told the Guardian. She said she felt the trial was an “appalling injustice” but that she felt buoyed up by “the fact that [the defendants] are four young white people feeling empathy and showing empathy and getting people to think”. “It’s moving beyond being a bystander, which is required from all of us,” Martin said. Throughout the 10-day trial, the public gallery was packed with locals, many of whom cheered videos shown in court of the moment Colston fell. Martin was there, and other supporters and friends of the defendants. But others, such as Douglas Peden, a local lawyer, and his two daughters, had come to watch history play out in the courtroom. “It’s the symbolism of it,” Peden said, admitting he also supported the defendants. “It’s property and ownership up against freedom of expression.” The feeling was reflected elsewhere in Bristol. Outside a pub in Bristol city centre after court one evening Jodie Lily, from Exeter, told the Guardian she knew at least 10 people who were present when the statue was toppled. “It’s only those four because they got their faces,” she said. “That piece of shit should have been taken down.” The bare facts of the case were not in question. Giving evidence, the defendants proudly recounted the roles they played. But they denied criminal damage, arguing their acts were justified by the offence caused in Bristol by the statue. It was a high-risk legal strategy, given that support for the toppling of Colston was not universal, even in Bristol. A week after the statue was felled, a counter protest by the empty plinth drew a 300-strong crowd, including a banner reading “all lives matter”. Concerns were felt across the UK. Polling by Policy Exchange found nearly half of people opposed the way the statue was toppled, compared with a quarter in support, while YouGov found that although a slim majority supported Colston’s removal, just more than one in 10 thought it was done in the right way. Nevertheless, change has since come in the wake of Colston’s toppling. Colston Hall, Bristol’s major events venue, changed its name – finally fulfilling an undertaking first made in 2017 – to the Bristol Beacon. Colston’s name was removed from pubs, buildings and roads. The 275-year-old Colston society was disbanded and his image was removed from stained glass windows. But at the same time, culture war battle lines were drawn, and the government sensed a populist win. Skuse, Graham, Ponsford and Milo have been cleared but new measures in the government’s police and crime bill will allow courts to send people found guilty of damaging a memorial to prison for 10 years. As critics have pointed out, someone caught defacing a statue could, under the proposals, be jailed for longer than someone found guilty of rape.
As for Colston himself, since being fished out of the River Avon by Bristol council, his statue has found his way to the city’s M Shed museum, where it has been transformed, according to Olusoga, into “the most important artefact” of the story of Britain’s relationship with its brutal slave history.

160;160;5402;5402;Travel sector welcomes end of pre-departure Covid tests for England;2022-01-05T16:49:36Z;['Gwyn Topham', 'Joanna Partridge'];['Travel & leisure', 'Airline industry', 'Business', 'Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'UK news', 'Manchester', 'Travel', 'Air transport'];"The aviation and travel industry has welcomed the scrapping of pre-departure tests for people travelling to England, which it had claimed were unnecessary and hugely damaging to the sector. Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday afternoon that the requirement would be lifted from 4am on Friday, along with the need for travellers to self-isolate on arrival until they receive a negative PCR test result. He said – as the industry had argued – that the latest Covid variant Omicron was “so prevalent these measures have a limited impact on the growth in cases while continuing to pose significant cost to our travel industry”. Arrivals in England will now need to take a lateral flow test no later than the end of day two, in line with the previous rules. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, said: “This is a hugely welcome move at a critical time in the booking season for passengers, and will provide a massive boost to those wanting to travel abroad or come to the UK this year. People will now be able to book knowing that – for the fully vaccinated – all emergency testing restrictions have been removed. “Today marks an important step towards learning to live alongside the virus, helping passengers and the travel sector look ahead to what will be an all-important spring and summer season.” Research commissioned earlier by Airlines UK and Manchester Airports Group suggested the removal of travel testing requirements would not affect overall rate of cases and hospitalisations in the UK. The two organisations said the research showed that domestic rather than international restrictions would be the only way to reduce Omicron’s spread within the country. Travel association Abta said the decision to reduce the testing requirements was “extremely welcome” but warned that the “damage had already been done”. The Business Travel Association urged the government to come up with a “robust plan for future variants that does not mean closing our borders and strangling our sector once more”. Ministers introduced additional testing requirements in late November and early December because of fears about the spread of the newly identified variant. Under the rules in place until they revert on Friday, all passengers arriving in the UK have had to take a pre-departure Covid test in the two days before setting off, although slightly different time limits apply in the four countries, as well as a PCR test within the first two days after their arrival.
Manchester Airports Group (MAG) said passenger numbers at its airports fell by more than 30% in early December after the introduction of new testing requirements. MAG’s chief executive, Charlie Cornish, said after Johnson’s announcement that the airport group looked forward to “working with government on a roadmap for the removal of all remaining restrictions, in order to help our prized aviation sector enjoy a full recovery”. Global airline body Iata said the change was “long overdue”. Its director general, Willie Walsh, said: “It’s now time to look again at the overall scheme and remove testing entirely for vaccinated travellers.” • This article was amended on 5 January 2022 to clarify the details about pre-departure Covid tests for people entering the UK.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/uk-travel-industry-international-covid-tests;2
161;161;5403;5403;Will the UK’s Covid booster campaign pick up speed in January?;2022-01-05T16:47:11Z;['Hannah Devlin'];['Vaccines and immunisation', 'Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Science', 'Microbiology', 'Health policy'];Official data shows the number of people getting boosted in the UK fell to just over 100,000 on Sunday, compared with highs of more than 900,000 before Christmas when on some days people were queueing for hours to get vaccinated. Asked about the slowdown, the government’s vaccine minister, Maggie Throup, said the Christmas break and public holidays were key factors. So will this week see higher numbers coming forward or are there other factors at play? What proportion of people are eligible for a booster? Almost 60% of over-12s have had their booster or third dose. But only half of the remaining 40% have had their second dose and it is notable that there wasn’t a dramatic uptick in the number of people coming forward for first and second doses in the pre-Christmas vaccination campaign. Since a three-month gap is needed between doses, the ceiling for boosters will remain at 80% of over-12s well into the spring. How many people have had to wait because they’ve tested positive for Covid? People need to wait 28 days after testing positive to be eligible for vaccination. So the huge surge in cases – 2 million were estimated to have had Covid in the week before Christmas – will have inevitably meant a large number of people postponing their booster. Figures on how many people this affected are not available. But the highest rates of Covid, with one in 15 people aged 25 to 35 estimated to be infected in England last week, also coincide with the age group that would be roughly due for their booster if they had their previous vaccinations on schedule. What happens if you get boosted while not realising you have Covid? The general guidance, not just for Covid, is not to have a vaccination if you’re running an infection. Clinical trials automatically discount people who test positive, so there is not much evidence on exactly how the immune system responds to an infection and a booster at the same time. There aren’t any known harms associated with the combination, aside from the obvious one of putting health professionals at risk if you attend a clinic while infectious. Since infection also boosts antibody levels, there is likely to be less benefit to getting a booster at the same time. It is possible that the side-effects of a booster, on top of mild Covid symptoms, might feel a bit worse, but there is no suggestion that this would be a clinical concern. With the move to lateral flow tests (LFTs), how will positive results be recorded if people don’t have to get a follow-up PCR? Fom 11 January in England, and from 6 January in Scotland, people who receive positive LFT results will be required to self-isolate immediately and won’t be required to take a confirmatory PCR test. In theory, all LFT results, including negative ones, are already supposed to be reported via the government’s test-and-trace system and feed into daily case numbers. In practice, a much smaller proportion of LFT results are reported compared with PCR results, which are automatically entered into the system when processed in the laboratory. However, cases are already running far above the numbers being confirmed by PCR testing and the UK is already relying on other methods, such as the Office for National Statistics Infection Survey, to assess levels of prevalence.;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/will-the-uks-covid-booster-campaign-pick-up-speed-in-january;7
162;162;5404;5404;Almost 200,000 new Covid cases reported in UK;2022-01-05T16:35:13Z;['Nicola Davis'];['Coronavirus', 'England', 'Health', 'Society', 'UK news', 'Omicron variant'];"Almost 200,000 more Covid cases have been reported in the UK, as an infection survey revealed one in 10 Londoners had Covid towards the end of last year. On Wednesday, 194,747 daily confirmed Covid cases were reported for the whole of the UK – reflecting the number of infections picked up by testing – with 150,232 cases reported for England alone. The figure does not include reinfections for most of the countries in the UK, and reflects cases by date reported, rather than by specimen date. While the UK total is lower than the 218,724 cases reported the day before, Tuesday’s data included figures covering a four-day period for Northern Ireland and a two-day period for Wales. Data released on Wednesday also reveals that in England there are 15,659 Covid patients in hospital, up from 15,044 the day before. Wednesday’s figure marks a 50% rise in a week. Figures for Scotland also reveal a continued increase in the number of Covid patients in hospital, with 1,223 reported on Wednesday. Data was not available for Wales or Northern Ireland. A further 334 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported in the UK on Wednesday – a figure last exceeded in early March. However, Wednesday’s figure includes a backlog in reporting from NHS England, going back to 1 January, as well as two days’ data on deaths from Scotland. The data comes as it was revealed one in 15 people in England had Covid last week, rising to one in 10 in London. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, an estimated 3,270,800 people in England, or about 6% of the population on average, had Covid in the week ending 31 December. The week before the figure was about one in 25, or 4% of the population on average. Infection levels also rose in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the most recent week, with the latest estimates suggesting that about one in 20 in the former two countries had Covid in the week ending 31 December, and about one in 25 for the latter. In the week before the figure was about one in 40 for all three countries. For all countries in the UK, Omicron is now the dominant coronavirus variant. The results reveal infection levels in England differ by age and region although they have risen across the board: levels were highest in those aged from school year 12 to 24 years old, at about one in 10 people in this age group.
However, levels were almost as high in other age groups including those aged two to school year 6 and those aged 25 to 34 where about one in 15 were estimated to have had Covid in the most recent week. By contrast the figure was about one in 45 for those aged 70 and over. In terms of regions in England, London had the highest infection levels, with about one in 10 estimated to have had Covid in the most recent week. However the team note there are hints the situation may be shifting. “In the last few days of 2021, the trend in the percentage testing positive was uncertain for those in London who are secondary school ages and those aged 25 to 49 years, which may mean that infections are no longer increasing among these ages in London, but it is currently too early to suggest if this is a continuing change in trend,” the team write. The lowest levels of infection were found in the south-west, where one in 30 are estimated to have had Covid in the week ending 31 December. “We continue to see infections across the UK increase, with Omicron now the dominant variant across all four nations,” said Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 Infection Survey. “There are early signs of a potential slowing of infections in London in the days before New Year’s Eve. However, it is too early to suggest this is a change in trend overall.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/covid-england-ons-data-one-in-15-infected;7
163;163;5405;5405;‘You can learn almost instantly’: a beginner’s guide to standup paddleboarding ;2022-01-05T16:30:39Z;['Cait Kelly'];['Fitness', 'Australia holidays', 'Victoria holidays', 'Hobbies', 'Travel', 'Australian lifestyle'];"I love the ocean but in the last two years, I haven’t seen her much. Now the world’s gotten a little bigger, all I want to do is be by the water. Sup – or standup paddleboarding – is the closest you can get without actually getting wet. You cruise along, admire the view, find a nice spot for lunch. You can dip in, dip out – hell, you can take a rod if you want, or do some downward dog on your board. Humans have been supping a long time – records go back to as early as 3,000BC, but the modern iteration was born in Hawaii in the 1940s, when surfer John Ah Choy could no longer get up and down on his board. He started to use a paddle to help him get out to the waves, his kids picked it up, and like many water-related activities that come from that island, it spread quickly across the globe. Paddleboarding is now a common feature in most Australian waterways. It’s often cited as the fastest growing water sport – and when you do it, you can tell why. For starters, you can learn almost instantly. You just hop on the board and when your balance is right, if you feel comfortable, you stand up. Simple.
Nic Cooper has been supping for years now. He loves it so much he’s made it his job – taking travellers around Victoria to the best spots. “I’m hardcore into it. But I’m not I’m not one of those that goes on, like, marathon Sups or anything like that. I just love being out in the ocean and just chilling,” he says. “I see it as relaxation.” Cooper says he’s never had a student who couldn’t do it – some stay on their knees, but given you’re cruising past turtles, dolphins and kangaroos, it’s still a good time. “Depending on your balance and stuff like that, you can get pretty good at it within a few hours,” he says.
Egalitarian in its demands, Cooper says all ages and most body types can Sup. “I think it’s made water sports accessible for everyone.” Once you’ve got the basics, you need to finesse your technique to get the most out of each stroke. While this isn’t essential for beginners, it’s a must to compete in a race, or to Sup your way along a river for a few days. This requires “bending your knees as you go forward and … leaning down on your paddle … to get the most propulsion as possible,” Cooper says. “Even giving your paddle a little twist as it exits at the back will have less push on the water and therefore it’ll be a more efficient stroke.” More advanced Sup-ers can even ride them like surfboards. Before we set out for a lesson on Melbourne’s waterways, Cooper’s best advice was “never look back”. Which of course, I forgot when a turtle swam under me.
I swivelled around and went very quickly from standing up paddleboarding to falling down paddleboarding. But I stayed dry, and luckily out of the frame of our fast-moving photographer. Despite the tumble, a sense of calm prevailed – it is like valium in a water sport.
As we drifted on the ocean just off Mt Martha beach, shadowed by peninsula “shacks” that would cost a cool $2m, I asked whether the sport was as egalitarian in price as it is in skill. How much does it cost to sit on a board for a hit of bliss regularly? Not much, or quite a lot, says Cooper. The cheapest, easiest way for those who want to try it is to book a Sup session or hire a board at the beach. Depending on where you are, board hire can be about $30 for 60 minutes. If you want a lesson to make sure you’ve got the basics – or to mine your guide for the best spots – it’ll cost about $60 for an hour. As for buying your own gear, it depends what you want to do with it. “If they want to go on these huge trips – 20, 30km along the coastline or whatever – then they’re going to want a long, thin touring board,” Cooper says. For activities like yoga, he suggests something wide and stable.
The cheapest Sup I could find online was a blow-up one going for $200 – without a pump. Price differences from there are about quality, ease, and weight – the more expensive boards blow up quicker, last longer and are substantially lighter, Cooper says. He warns to avoid the cheapest new boards “because it’s just going to break”. A high quality board new will cost about $900, but secondhand options are the best way to score a bargain. Supping isn’t a solo sport, either. Aficionados can join their local clubs and even plan holidays around the activity. “You can take them in a backpack so you could go to some really awesome places … Once you’re confident and you know you’re not going to fall off, then you can go anywhere really.” This piece was supported by Visit Victoria and Wild Adventures Melbourne.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/06/you-can-learn-almost-instantly-a-beginners-guide-to-standup-paddleboarding;5
164;164;5406;5406;Messy? Unproductive? Need to dismantle your privilege? There’s a guided journal for that;2022-01-05T16:30:39Z;['Jenny Valentish'];['Health & wellbeing', 'Australian lifestyle', 'Life and style', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Publishing'];"The pleasure of watching a streak of positive habits accumulating on a whiteboard has become almost a dependency for me. So much so, I debated packing it in my suitcase for a short trip away. But the humble whiteboard has a more portable, sophisticated upgrade: the guided journal. A few years ago I thought the trajectory of these workbooks – designed to probe or organise different facets of your behaviour or health – had probably peaked. Back then, deluxe hardbacks lined the shelves of stylish stationery chains (Kikki K favoured own-brand pastel numbers: Happy, Thrive, Dream Life), while Urban Outfitters displayed quirky titles (Moon Journal, My Adorable Cat) from the lineage of Keri Smith’s 2007 Wreck This Journal in the gift section, alongside moustache mugs and line-drawn temporary tattoos.
But the upswing is far from over, and the scope has become ever broader. There are journals designed to delve deeply into hobbies, or straighten out specific personality kinks. Some favour style over substance – expensive hardbacks with minimal prompts – while others offer a wealth of theory between exercises. Bianca Jafari is a product development executive at Thames and Hudson, focusing on gift products: puzzles, stationery, games and, in the pipeline, guided journals. She says journals are no longer just the domain of niche or self-help publishers. The bigger publishing houses are basing journals on their bestsellers, such as Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck Journal (HarperCollins) and Michelle Obama’s Becoming: A Guided Journal for Discovering Your Voice (Penguin).
“Producing a guided journal is a no-brainer because they can use content that they already have,” says Jafari. “For example, the Michelle Obama journal is a big win for Penguin because they already own the images. They’ve already got data that says that the content is a bestseller. There’s already an audience that exists.” That’s all well and good for the publishers, but can guided journals really live past the punter’s first flush of good intentions, or are they destined to be abandoned as quickly as a teenage girl sets aside the diary she received for Christmas, into which she poured her New Year resolutions? I decided to try a few. Journals to clean up specific areas of your life “Some journals are interest-based to help you practise a craft, like astrology, or manage your veganism or gardening,” says Jafari. Since none of those are areas of concern for me, I unearthed some that are applicable to many of us as a new year begins. Collective Hub, from Australian publisher Lisa Messenger, puts out books and journals aimed at entrepreneurs. Know Your Numbers is one such product – a chunky hardback that works hard for the money with budget templates, saving tips, start-up launch advice and income tracking tables. Several publishers offer journals dedicated to going alcohol-free, including Sober As F*** (based on Sarah Ordo’s memoir); the 90-day journal Dear Alcohol, I’m Breaking Up With You and the Alcohol Experiment Journal, based on the bestselling book This Naked Mind by Annie Grace.
I tried the Declutter Challenge (Mango Publishing) by Cassandra Aarssen, which suggests you “Namast’ay home this weekend and declutter some junk”. Cynics will say this paperback isn’t helping by adding to your hoarding, but Aarssen does actually invite you to bin it, on the final (120th) page. Her “30 quick steps” to organising your home draw on mindfulness, visualisation and gratitude. As a way to avoid the long-overdue pruning of my garden hedges, I list “six awesome things about decluttering my home” and draw the things in my lounge-room that make me the happiest in the cartoon picture frames provided. I do chuck some things from the drawers into a box in the car port, but a few days later it’s Christmas Day and I receive a whole variety of future landfill. Then the Declutter Challenge joins the teetering pile of journals on my desk, presumably for ever. Goal-oriented journals The line between habit-tracking books, such as bullet journals (which focus on to-do lists, logging completed tasks, and the steps towards achieving various-sized goals) and guided journals has blurred to near indistinction. “Many people associate habit trackers with the new year and downloading a few apps and promising to drink more water,” says Jafari. She believes that they are satisfying, but that commitment to a guided journal is “more special”. “You can sit with it over enough time to block everything else out … and you pour yourself into it.” One such hybrid is the Australian creation The Resilience Agenda, a “mental fitness diary” that provides strategies for achieving said fitness; though your main task is to identify each day’s three top priorities to help you reach your goals.
James Clear’s bestselling Atomic Habits has been turned into the Clear Habit Journal; while Adelaide United’s football club captain Stefan Mauk has created the Inner Game, to help athletes with goal monitoring and preparation. I tried out Mindset. Reset, from Perth-based finance professional turned life coach Alisa Pettit. Promising to focus on “the non-fluff emotional stuff”, she’s delivered a generous amount of theory among the exercises. There’s still plenty of scribbling to do, and I find this the most productive journal yet. I look at the hierarchy of 10 areas of my life and find I’m tanking on “spirituality” and “community”. I’m encouraged to analyse how blame, justification and lack of responsibility have so far scuppered my goals. Then there’s the goal-setting itself. Pettit has designed three contracts that you can stick to the mirror, based on your short-term, middle-term and long-term goals. Mine are choreographing a pole-dance routine by February; developing an open mic comedy set in three months and entering a bodybuilding competition within 12 months. Serendipitously, I see they could all feed into one another. Tough-love journals
Finally, there are the journals that go for the jugular, either suggesting urgent reflection is needed – such as with Me and White Supremacy by Layla Saad – or tackling tough topics, such as Grief, A Guided Journal by Australian marriage celebrant Jo Betz, written after she lost her husband, and Susan Buniva’s Successful Co-Parenting with a Toxic Ex. “These are quite different to the self-help journals, because they’re quite intrusive,” says Jafari. “Like the Judgement Detox Journal [by Gabrielle Bernstein], which asks, ‘Why do I feel the need to judge, and what happened in my own life that makes me confident to judge someone else?’”
I tried Cheaper Than Therapy (Running Press), to which no author is credited, unless you include the nods to Freud and Jung. Inside are Rorschach inkblot tests, dream analysis, word association tests and methods to actualise your worst self, and 120 prompts, hopping from the distant past, to the past week, to your general psyche. As the foreword says, none of this is to be taken “super-seriously”. I decide this journal might be a good vehicle to tackle my pornography use (very healthy or very unhealthy, depending on how you look at it), via prompts such as “Do you feel worthy of scorn? Why or why not?” and “What’s your sexual fantasy? OK. Now tell me the real one? What do you think that means?” as well as the quiz “How psychosexual are you?” (“Do you ever pee yourself a little?” “Do you relentlessly chew gum?”). The answers are enlightening but, obviously, are to remain as closely guarded as my search engine results.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/06/messy-unproductive-need-to-dismantle-your-privilege-theres-a-guided-journal-for-that;5
165;165;5407;5407;Easy wins: a simple dal recipe adds a dash of healthy, comfort food to your diet ;2022-01-05T16:30:39Z;['Rosemary Bolger'];['Life and style', 'Food', 'Health & wellbeing'];"It’s healthy, tasty and easy to make. With split pulses or lentils as its main ingredient, dal is a good source of protein, fibre and iron, making it the comfort food you can enjoy freely without feeling disgusting afterwards. I first discovered dal during an extended camping trip in the Northern Territory in 40C heat. As the main storage option was the boot of the car, that narrowed down the meal options somewhat.
A two-step dal mix that could be heated up on the camp stove in minutes soon became the star dish on a menu that otherwise consisted of two-minute noodles, pasta and jar sauce and bland tinned soup. And back in the city, with the many options that refrigeration and a fully fledged kitchen affords, dal remains a staple. An everyday dish across India, there are seemingly endless varieties to try (many of which are vegan), from refreshing tomato or light coconut-based dals to rich dal makhani (which means butter in Hindi). Plus you can easily adapt it and add whatever veggies need using up. Many don’t require the dal to be soaked first and can be cooked in under 30 minutes. If you’re less of a guts than me and have leftovers, I hear it lasts well in the freezer too.
I suggest finding one or two that work for you and sticking with them. That way you can skip having to choose a recipe and write a list before you go shopping and cook it, as it’s somewhere in that process that I usually replace one of those steps with “get takeaway”. My go-to recipe is Meera Sodha’s quick coconut dal in her book East. She came up with it shortly after having a baby when she was “still a little broken and exhausted”: so, you know, manageable for those of us with regular energy levels but who are less advanced in the kitchen. The yellow soupy goodness topped with a zingy tomato sambal is very satisfying. And if that’s too tricky, grab the pre-prepared packet dal next time you go to the supermarket.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/06/easy-wins-find-a-dal-recipe-you-love-and-reap-the-rewards;5
166;166;5408;5408;Youth mental health: Australia needs to look beyond ills of social media to fix crisis, children’s commissioner says;2022-01-05T16:30:39Z;['Paul Karp'];['Mental health', 'Children', 'Australia news', 'Social media', 'Health'];"Addressing children’s mental health is “more complex” than blaming social media and requires investment in social housing and supports through schools, the children’s commissioner has said. Anne Hollonds spoke to Guardian Australia in a wide-ranging interview about Australian governments’ responses to Covid-19, and a suite of new measures at the federal level to tackle bullying online. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has made the affect of social media on youth mental health a focus in the lead-up to the 2022 election, campaigning on online safety and arguing reforms are needed, particularly to prevent harassment of women and girls.
Hollonds said she “absolutely” supports the legislation to unmask anonymous social media trolls, the social media inquiry and regime of eSafety commissioner content takedown orders as measures that put “the best interest of children as the first priority” in the “unregulated” digital world. But Hollonds warned that a decade-long increase in mental health problems including self-harm, which predates the Covid-19 pandemic, has other social and economic dimensions. “There are some people who might like to say ‘oh it’s all the fault of social media’. “That’s often the go-to answer as to why kids have mental health problems. I wouldn’t deny it has an effect but it’s not as simple as that, it’s more complex.” Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data shows in any given year 20% of Australians experience mental ill health and that, even before the pandemic, three-quarters of Australians with mental ill health were under 25.

One in four Australian teens reported experiencing psychological distress in 2020 and parents have warned that the pandemic and lockdowns have made it harder to find help. Hollonds said poor youth mental health is a “long-term increasing trend” which Covid has “opened our eyes to in a way we can’t ignore” due to a “spike where there were extended lockdowns”. “It’s something that obviously worries me hugely … you just have to ask how bad does it have to get before we recognise that we need to make children a national policy priority?” In addition to the way living in a digital world has “changed the experience of childhood”, Hollonds nominates the financial pressure from the cost of housing and inadequate support systems as causes.
“For example the education system … for the kids who are struggling, perhaps the old style education system where it’s just about academic learning is not really doing enough for kids,” she said. “I think Covid has shown schools are about much more than academic learning that can be replaced by zoom. “By closing schools we actually added pressure to the distress of kids.” One of the main lessons from the pandemic is that schools “should be the last to close and the first to reopen, because of their importance in the overall wellbeing of children”, Hollonds said. “In my view … we’ve under-estimated school as a community hub of support for the wellbeing of kids and their families.” Hollonds said that some other developed countries had better integrated the health and education systems making it “easier for people to get help they need”. Hollonds said the cost of housing and the “spike in costs during Covid” was also a deeply worrying factor that emerges from her consultation with children, young people and their families.
“It’s those areas with low incomes, higher poverty and disadvantage … outside CBDs, in rural and outer urban areas – [they are] precisely the areas where rents have become unaffordable [during the pandemic].” Hollonds called on governments to address “under-investment in social housing over decades” and to look at economic drivers of housing costs. Her comments back calls from other experts for more comprehensive mental health supports and higher income supports to tackle the youth mental health crisis. In November the former Labor premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill, who’s now chief executive of Minderoo Foundation’s Thrive by Five initiative, accused the Morrison government of neglecting to assess the affect of the pandemic on young children, with current policies labelled “a series of crisis responses”. The latest Naplan data has found that Australian schoolchildren’s basic literacy and numeracy skills were relatively unscathed during first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, but gaps are widening between city students and those in regional and remote areas. Guardian Australia previously reported concerns from teachers that the compounded effects of two years of intermittent learning in some areas are only just beginning to become apparent, especially for younger cohorts (up to grade 2) that are not captured by the Naplan dataset.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/06/youth-mental-health-australia-needs-to-look-beyond-ills-of-social-media-to-fix-crisis-childrens-commissioner-says;7
167;167;5409;5409;The Little Dum Dum Club: the 10 funniest things we have ever seen (on the internet);2022-01-05T16:30:39Z;['N/A'];['Comedy', 'Culture', 'Podcasting', 'Internet', 'Social media'];"We’re Tommy Dassalo and Karl Chandler, and we make a living as hosts of comedy podcast The Little Dum Dum Club. The internet gave birth to us, and it can end us. Guardian Australia has certain rules about what we can submit as the “funniest things we have ever seen on the internet” and according to them, it’s not appropriate to just send in a bunch of clips of our comedian friends where we re-voice them and make them say negative stuff about vaccines. So instead, we’ve sent in a bunch of other junk. Catch you at the end for a plug. 1. Dave Chappelle on Kramer Neither of us are very big consumers of standup specials on the streaming services, but this short clip of Dave Chappelle at the Laugh Factory is a massive favourite – in which he kinda defends Michael Richards’s infamous set there. “Hang in there, Kramer!” has become an essential, multi-purpose catchphrase in most elements of our lives. But most of all, it’s just fun to imagine that we live in a world where Dave Chappelle literally thinks that Michael Richards’s name is Kramer.
2. The ‘India’ prank calls to 2SM Prank calls were trolling before we had the internet. In 2006, a bunch of people – including Sam Mac, before he was a Gold Logie-nominated weatherman – were listening to a quiz segment on Sydney radio station 2SM and heard a caller mistakenly guess “India” to a question. The caller was then berated on-air by host Graeme Gilbert for guessing such a wrong answer.
The natural next step for Sam Mac et al, of course, was to get everyone they knew to call in and guess “India” to every question that was asked – for the next million years or so. We both became obsessed with this. We discovered it just before we shared a car in a four-hour traffic jam, and the word “India” was possibly 70% of our conversation. Sam Mac should’ve won the Gold Logie for this.
3. I Think You Should Leave: Driver’s Ed sketch Tim Robinson’s I Think You Should Leave is easily the funniest sketch show of the last few years – and this sketch is a really great taster of what you can expect. To be completely honest, we’d probably both pick the courtroom sketch from season two, but we had to submit clips that are officially available online. So go watch that sketch on Netflix and then pretend that you’ve seen it embedded in this article. Tables!
4. Jackass Forever: movie trailer We get it, it’s incredibly stupid to put a movie trailer in the list of funniest things we’ve seen. But: as if this movie isn’t going to rule. Its release date getting bumped back from last October to this year is probably the worst thing to have happened to us in 2021. Although watching it in a packed theatre at the moment is probably a dumber stunt than anything they actually do in the movie.
5. Final 2 This is a longtime personal favourite of Tommy’s. An animation student put together an animation showreel of Dobby from Harry Potter – a decent way of showing off his skills – but then went the extra mile by inserting himself into the video and writing a little scene between himself and Dobby, where they seem to be in love with each other? Which, as far as I can remember, is not canon in the Harry Potter universe.
He’s also recorded Dobby’s dialogue on what seems to be the world’s cheapest microphone, and then filmed all of his parts in a public park, so you can see people walking their dogs through the background. No hate though, because the animation is great and is far better than anything I could do (after dropping out of animation school after eight months).
6. Kay’s Cooking: avocado on toast Kay is a lovely lady in the north of England who videos herself learning to cook the most basic of foods. She’s intriguing and eminently likable but boy oh boy does her food look like a sack of crap. In this particular episode, she’s trying to make avocado on toast for the first time ever. However, she’s mistakenly used an eggplant instead, and is confused when she tries to mash the rock-hard innards of this “avocado”. It sounds bad, and it looks even worse. She’s since relabelled the video as “aubergine on toast”, to save face. Kay, you can’t fool us, especially by using the fancier term “aubergine”.
7. Succession but everyone wants some of Logan’s M&Ms Another Tommy pick. It seems like everyone loves Succession at the moment, but I don’t know if very many people have seen this clip. This guy is unbelievable. Doing even one of these characters so spot-on would be impressive, let alone the whole cast.
I have a very limited range of impressions – I think the only way I’d be able to pull off a video like this is there was a prestige HBO drama where every role was played by Dave Hughes. 8. Seinfeld A few years ago, we were giddy off the back of selling out a live podcast at the Sydney Opera House and being invited to do a live podcast at the most exclusive comedy festival in the world, Just For Laughs in Montreal. We had a meeting with a major radio station in Melbourne, thinking, “Here we go. We could get a radio show here.” Instead, the executive who was going to meet with us pulled out without explanation and sent in some guy who knew nothing about us (or much else), and ended his meeting with two comedians, in the year of 2017, by asking us, “Have you ever seen Seinfeld? That guy is funny.” So, we’d like to pass that suggestion on to you guys. Have you ever seen Seinfeld? If not, here it is.
9. Norm MacDonald on Saturday Night Live Weirdly, the official Saturday Night Live YouTube account has no clips of the late, great Norm MacDonald hosting Weekend Update: one of the best and most influential bits of comedy in the last 25 years. So instead, I (Karl) am gonna supply this stupid, weird sketch that I love so much in tribute to Norm.
Most of the cast in this sketch were fired after this 1995 end-of-season episode (Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Jay Mohr), and others were demoted (Norm and David Spade), and it’s clearly written by dead men walking. It’s SO dumb and the audience appear to HATE it. But what do people know? NOTHING. 10. The Little Dum Dum Club Seems a little silly to promote everyone else to people out there who, more than likely, don’t even know our own stuff. So, here’s our stuff. It’s the story of the time I (Karl) annoyed an open mic-er who was trying to get a gig at my weekly comedy night by relentlessly insisting he bring Dave Hughes along, despite the fact he clearly didn’t know him. And we told it on our show to Hughesy, who loved it. Stupid, pretty funny and a decent summation of the last 11 years of doing this podcast.
The Little Dum Dum Club’s long-delayed live recording of their 500th episode takes place on 15 January at the Athenaeum Theatre, Melbourne.

168;168;5410;5410;‘Falling over in a screaming heap’: overworked staff quit under-resourced NSW regional hospital;2022-01-05T16:30:38Z;['Peter Hannam'];['Health', 'Coronavirus', 'New South Wales', 'Australia news', 'Hospitals', 'Omicron variant'];"One of New South Wales’ major regional hospitals had to source its own triage tent, is sending Covid tests six hours away due to a lack of space for its own diagnosis machine, and has had positive patients wait 30 hours to be transferred to a designated hospital for those with the virus. Doctors at the Tweed hospital, which is 1km from the Queensland border in northern NSW and serves a hinterland that includes Byron Bay, are even donning personal protective equipment to drive home, in their own cars, asymptomatic Covid-positive patients because taxis won’t take them. Kristin Ryan-Agnew, president of the local branch of the Nurses and Midwives Association and a senior nurse at the hospital, said local Covid cases were tripling daily, much faster than the 5o% growth in new cases reported for NSW as a whole on Wednesday.
As a result of increased presentations to Tweed’s emergency department, nurses were doing “double shifts every day” with one day off before resuming the toil. “They’re going to fall over in a screaming heap,” she said. “They will not be able to manage.” Eighteen staff, many of them senior, have resigned since December out of a roster of about 150, citing burnout and the better conditions offered over the border. Queensland offers $1,800 a year for nurses’ education, a Covid bonus – both absent in NSW – and higher wages, Ryan-Agnew said. “They were really top-notch, really good quality staff, and they can walk up to the Gold Coast and they’ll just completely snaffle them.” As Guardian Australia reported on Wednesday, nurses at Lismore Base hospital – the destination for Tweed’s Covid patients needing treatment – are also struggling to cope with a surge in medical needs. The Tweed hospital is buckling under spiking demand for care and a lack of trained staff and appropriate equipment. A senior manager, for instance, had to phone around themselves and then purchase the triage tent prior to Christmas after months of pleading to the health department, Ryan-Agnew said. The tent, though, remains far from adequate, with no toilet, forcing potentially Covid-positive patients – and anyone waiting for PCR testing to cross the border – to traipse through the main hospital lobby. “You can have people with heart conditions, sick kids, elderly, frail, all sitting there waiting to be seen, and you’ve got a potential Covid patient walking through the waiting room,” Ryan-Agnew said. Patients with chest and severe abdominal pain, septic children and adults should be in beds not a tent without nursing care, staff said. Earlier this week, one Covid patient had to wait 17 hours before being transferred to Lismore, while another patient had to wait 30 hours before being moved on Wednesday. The nurse manager shares office space and air-conditioning with two beds set aside for Covid patients with no air-locked space for changing PPE. “We have bottles of hand sanitiser sitting on top of overflowing bins, flapping Covid tent flaps compromising PPE,” another staff member, who requested anonymity, said. “We also continue to struggle getting adequate PPE and supplies, certain masks run out, no hair coverings and no disposable blood pressure cuffs.”
A Northern NSW Local Health District spokesperson said a “transportable treatment area” had been set up to treat Covid-positive patients without serious illness so they didn’t need to enter the hospital. “As with any month in a large organisation there has been some staff turnover, however, this is not different [from] other months or years,” the spokesperson said. “These positions have been filled with new staff, casual staff, and any potential shortages can also be filled with staff between wards and facilities. “Our workforce across northern NSW has been increased and upskilled, with more than 265 staff attending surge training in intensive care, emergency care and immunisation specialties to provide additional capacity if needed.
“We regularly review our stocks and supply chains of resources, including PPE and pharmacy items, to ensure adequate supplies.” According to Ryan-Agnew, some of Tweed’s problems were partly self-inflicted. Pathology North, the department’s regional pathology unit, offered to supply Tweed with a BD MAX machine used to conduct Covid tests on the spot. That would save sending the results three times a day for what can be a six-hour journey. “We just needed the scientists to use it because you have to have doctors to be able to read the results,” Ryan-Agnew said, but the hospital management refused to set aside space to house it. “We still don’t have the BD MAX. That’s been argued for months and months and months.” Do you know more about pressure in the healthcare system? Contact peter.hannam@theguardian.com.

169;169;5411;5411;Rapid antigen test importers say ‘frustrating’ regulatory delays are holding up kits for at-home use;2022-01-05T16:30:38Z;['Christopher Knaus', 'Ben Smee'];['Health', 'Australia news', 'Coronavirus'];"Importers of already-approved Covid rapid tests say they are being frustrated by long regulatory delays blocking them from selling the devices for home use, further strangling supply at a time of peak demand. The Morrison government has faced sustained criticism over its failure to shore up supplies of Covid rapid tests ahead of the current Omicron wave, including by companies critical of the slow regulatory approval process.
Currently, Australia’s health regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, needs to separately approve the same rapid Covid test for use in two different settings: at home through self-testing, or at various points of care under the supervision of a health practitioner of staff member. Approvals for home tests were slow to commence and are still lagging badly behind. Just 18 tests have been approved for home use, while 59 rapid antigen or lateral flow tests have been approved for use in care settings. Suppliers who already have approval to supply rapid tests in point of care settings are facing months-long delays to obtain the regulator’s green light to sell the same devices for self-testing, despite the fact they have already been deemed safe and reliable, and generally only require a tweaking of packaging and instructions. One importer said they had been waiting three months for the TGA to examine the instructions included in the box of their already-approved rapid test, to ensure they were suitable for home use.
“That is a source of frustration for many importers,” he said. “You would think that maybe if the TGA was to say to us ‘this is what your insert has to say’, we would say exactly that and away we go.” “But in the meantime we are communicating backwards and forwards and have been doing so for some time.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
An analysis of registers published by the TGA shows 26 suppliers of rapid antigen or lateral flow tests are currently approved to sell tests for use in point of care settings, but not for home use. Not all of those 26 suppliers have applied for approval to sell their tests for home use and some rapid tests require the use of special instruments, not available in a home setting, to properly obtain a result. The TGA said it is prioritising the assessment of self-tests, but suggested delays were often caused by applicants. “For most applications received by the TGA, there is missing information that requires additional submissions from suppliers which in turn, extends the finalisation of the regulatory review and approval process until the information is submitted and then assessed,” a spokesperson said. The spokesperson said self-tests must comply with minimum standards, including performance criteria and information on labelling and instructions for use that can be easily understood by consumers.
In cases where approval for point of care tests already existed, suppliers wanting to sell the same test for home use must provide additional information and change instructions for use to enable self-testing, the spokesperson said. Instructions written for health professionals contained assumed levels of knowledge that were “not suitable for consumers or lay-persons”, the TGA said. The supplier is also required to show how they would provide support for self-testing, including, for example, through instructional YouTube videos. Suppliers must also provide usability testing by untrained, unsupervised users. “The TGA’s assessment process ensures that Australians can be confident that the tests they are using are safe, perform as intended, with the relevant steps and support provided to consumers who purchase them.” One test distributor said the approval process for an at-home Covid test had taken several months, despite the TGA having previously approved another supplier to sell identical tests for home use.
“It’s just so difficult and it’s taken far too long,” the distributor said. They said tests cost about AUD$3.50 out of China, plus freight, warehousing and distribution costs. National cabinet agreed on a plan late Wednesday evening to give disadvantaged people small cash payments to cover the cost. The agreement will provide up to 10 rapid antigen tests free to more than six million concession card-holders, but everyone else who is not a close contact of a case and symptomatic will still have to pay. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, dismissed growing calls for universal free access to rapid testing kits, at odds with Labor leader Anthony Albanese, who on Wednesday called for rapid tests to be made freely available. “We have considered the options and it is clear that this is the simplest, most efficient, fairest and most responsible way to fix the mess that Scott Morrison has made of testing at this critical juncture of the pandemic,” Albanese said.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/06/rapid-antigen-test-importers-say-frustrating-regulatory-delays-are-holding-up-kits-for-at-home-use;7
170;170;5412;5412;‘We’re struggling’: Covid surge spoils summer for Australia’s hospitality and tourism businesses;2022-01-05T16:30:38Z;['Ben Butler'];['Business', 'Coronavirus', 'Australian economy', 'Victoria', 'Queensland', 'Melbourne', 'Australia news'];"For Phil Johnson, the licensee of Aireys Pub, keeping the hotel open seven days a week at what should be peak season has instead become a “day-by-day proposition”. During summer the hotel’s lawn, which boasts spectacular views of the sea and sunset, is usually packed with holidaymakers who have flocked to the Victorian surf coast town of Aireys Inlet to escape Melbourne’s heat. But this year the pub’s takings are on target to be down by about 20% over summer due to a combination of staff being unable to work because they fear they have Covid and people staying away because they don’t want to catch it.
The pub is among businesses grappling with a staff shortage crisis gripping hospitality and tourism operations from Victoria to Queensland, as skyrocketing Covid cases caused by the Omicron wave and a shortage of testing keeps workers away from their jobs. Johnson said the hotel had also struggled to find staff in the run-up to Christmas because two normal sources of labour – backpackers and cooks who come from overseas on skilled migration visas – were unavailable due to the pandemic. “We have 40, 45 staff over this peak period,” he said. “At the moment I’ve probably got about 10 with Covid or suspected Covid, which is making life really hard.” He said workers have been unable to confirm whether they have it because of the long waits for PCR tests at the nearest site, about 30km away in the Geelong suburb of Torquay, and the unavailability of rapid antigen tests. “A few people have had like one or two, but I was in Geelong this morning, just going through Chemist Warehouse, but I can’t find any,” he said. “Our kitchen’s good, which is good, so it’s just the front of house that we’re struggling with. It’s just a day-by-day proposition at the moment.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Some customers are also staying away, even though Aireys Inlet appears to be as full of people as usual – no short-term rentals are available in the town this week, according to booking website stayz.com. “We are not as busy as we thought we’d be because a lot of people are being cautious,” Johnson said. “It seems like a few families down here got it, so they’re staying away. And a lot of the oldies who we’d normally see just aren’t coming because I think they’re obviously, rightly, concerned.” He said the fall in business so far was “not great, but not the end of the world”. “If we come to a grinding halt next week, then we’re going to be in a whole lot of pain, but touch wood we’ll just keep going.”
Staff shortages have hit tourism and hospitality operators across Victoria and the country, with reports of restaurants shut in nearby Lorne. On the other side of the bay, Hotel Sorrento, which services millionaire’s playground the Mornington Peninsula, closed suddenly on New Year’s Eve “due to health & safety reasons”, operators said on social media. It will reopen from midday on Friday, the hotel said on Tuesday. Up north, the luxury Intercontinental resort on Hayman Island, in Queensland’s Whitsunday islands, has cancelled tourist bookings because staff are in isolation, while the restaurant industry in holiday hotspot the Gold Coast has reportedly ground to a halt. Staff shortages have also hit domestic travel, with flight numbers at less than 80% of what was seen in January 2019, before the pandemic hit, according to data compiled by rating agency Fitch. “It’s very dramatic, staff shortages that are really starting to bite now,” Daniel Gschwind, the chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, said. He said the sector had suffered from a lack of labour even before the pandemic, with cooks, chefs and hotel managers in short supply, although the Queensland industry brought more than 30,000 people back to work last year. “The reality is we’re still short of what we need now,” he said. “It is now made worse because with Omicron spreading, which we anticipated, it is taking staff out of jobs. “That has actually now led a number of operators to operate at reduced hours or just close completely because they haven’t got enough staff.” He said difficulties getting PCR tests were making the situation worse. “Getting a test is a challenge and getting the result is a further problem because it’s not as if they arrive in 24 hours any more, it takes days,” he said. “We wanted the borders to open and we knew we had to take that step but it makes it so much harder.” He said two years of international borders being closed had also cut off the flow of working holiday visa holders, international students and skilled visa holders on which the industry had relied. “People have all kinds of views about that but the reality is that the Australian economy was fuelled by thousands of international workers,” he said.
Karma Lord, the director of the Hospo Voice division of the United Workers Union, said workers wanted to get back but were concerned about being put in potentially unsafe situations. “Now, with Omicron cases rising around Australia, many hospitality workers are struggling to get back to work because they’re in isolation or sick with Covid-19,” she said. The industry relied too much on casual workers, Lord said. “It’s time hospitality jobs were well paid, secure and reliable jobs that workers can count on,” she said. “It’s terrible that many hospitality venues are having to shut their doors due to rising case numbers and staff shortages, but it’s also terrible that so many workers in hospitality have never had access to paid leave when they’re sick or need to care for loved ones, let alone know how many hours they will work week to week.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/06/were-struggling-covid-surge-spoils-summer-for-australias-hospitality-and-tourism-businesses;2
171;171;5414;5414;Former Labour peer Nazir Ahmed found guilty of serious sexual assault;2022-01-05T16:20:54Z;['Maya Wolfe-Robinson'];['UK news'];The former Labour peer Nazir Ahmed has been found guilty of serious sexual assault against a young boy and the attempted rape of a girl when he was a teenager in the 1970s. Lord Ahmed, 64, was found guilty on Wednesday of buggery against a boy in Rotherham, and twice attempting to rape a girl. Buggery was the legal term for the specific sexual assault at the time of the offences. He was charged alongside his two older brothers, Mohammed Farouq, 71, and Mohammed Tariq, 65, but both were deemed unfit to stand trial. A woman told a jury at Sheffield crown court that Ahmed attempted to rape her in 1973 and 1974, when the defendant was about 16 or 17 years old, but she was much younger. The former politician was also found guilty of a serious sexual assault against a boy under 11 in 1972. The jury was played a recording of a telephone call between the two complainants, made by the woman after she went to the police in 2016. Tom Little QC, prosecuting, told the jury that the call was prompted by the man contacting the woman by email saying: “I have evidence against that paedophile.” Ahmed claimed the allegations were a “malicious fiction” but the prosecution said the call showed they were not “made up or concocted”. In the recording, the woman said to the man: “What they did to you was utterly wrong and it’s time now to seek justice for the little boy who could not protect himself.” Ahmed, who denied all the charges, was found guilty on Wednesday of two counts of attempted rape and one of buggery. Appointed a life peer by Tony Blair, Ahmed resigned from the Labour party in 2013, and retired from the House of Lords in 2020 but has retained his peerage and title of Lord Ahmed of Rotherham. His brothers Farouq and Tariq faced charges of indecent assault in relation to the same boy that Ahmed abused and, also on Wednesday, the jury found that they had carried out the acts alleged. The judge, Mr Justice Lavender, bailed Ahmed to appear at the same court for sentencing on 4 February. Rosemary Ainslie, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said the verdicts clearly showed “that no matter the delay between the offences and the trial, and the defences raised, they could be sure that the accounts of the victims were credible and true”. “One of these defendants held a position of power, influence and responsibility for some time in the House of Lords but this case clearly illustrates that where there is sufficient evidence, even in challenging cases, the CPS will bring a prosecution, put evidence before a jury and see rightful convictions”, she added. A previous trial collapsed last year due to errors made by the prosecution. Ainslie conceded that “disclosure failures should not happen”, but the case showed the challenges faced in dealing with “huge amounts of information” and proper disclosure to the defence to allow a fair trial. “But the case also shows our determination to admit problems, overcome them and pursue the case, and the court’s ability to ensure the defendants receive a fair trial and their victims see justice,” she added. • This article was amended on 21 January 2022. An earlier version described Ahmed as a “former peer” and the “former Lord Ahmed of Rotherham”. While he is no longer a Labour peer, having resigned from the party in 2013, he is still a life peer and retained his title after retiring from the House of Lords.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/former-peer-nazir-ahmed-found-guilty-of-serious-sexual-assault;1
172;172;5415;5415;Stephen Colbert on Omicron school closures: ‘Release strategic reserve of mothers-in-law’;2022-01-05T16:18:00Z;['Adrian Horton'];['Late-night TV roundup', 'Stephen Colbert', 'TV comedy', 'Comedy', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Television'];"Stephen Colbert Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon cancelled their week of shows on Tuesday after both tested positive for Covid-19, leaving Stephen Colbert as the only late-night host on the air, as Trevor Noah and Jimmy Kimmel remain on holiday.
Meyers and Fallon join the over one million new cases of Covid reported in the US on Monday – a record high, though case reporting was delayed because of the holiday weekend. “See, it’s not really that bad,” Colbert said. “It’s like when an exterminator says, ‘don’t worry, a thousand rats didn’t just move into your breakfast nook. It was just one rat, who gave birth over the weekend to a thousand rats.’” The Omicron fifth wave of Covid has forced school districts in Newark, Milwaukee, Cleveland and Atlanta to shift back to remote learning. “No! I long for the good ole days when our kids could safely go to school to butt-chug tide pods,” the Late Show host joked.
“Obviously this is a big strain on parents,” he continued, as some were given just hours of notice for the school closures. “Parents need emergency childcare help now,” he said. “I am calling on the federal government to release our strategic reserve of mothers-in-law. You know their motto: ‘I see you’re too busy to empty the bathroom trashcan …’” Nevertheless, Colbert continued, certain Republicans continue making idiotic comments about Covid, such as Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who told a radio show on Monday: “Why have we assumed that the body’s natural immune system isn’t the marvel that it really is? Why do we think that we can create something better than God in terms of – in terms of combating disease?” “OK, yes, I get it – God created our immune systems. He also created Ron Johnson, so he has been known to shank it,” Colbert responded. “So he raises the question: does the Lord want you to have the vaccine? I don’t know, but take Ron Johnson’s advice, and you might have a chance to ask God face to face.” And in other news, Apple became the first company in history to reach a $3tn market value on Monday – larger than the gross domestic products of Britain and India, and more valuable than all of the world’s cryptocurrencies “but not even half as annoying”, said Colbert. The California-based company has been on a steep growth trajectory in recent years, hitting the $1tn valuation in 2018, then $2tn in 2020 and a year and a half later, $3tn. “Hopefully, with that kind of cash, they can finally afford to fix that bite in their logo,” Colbert quipped.";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/05/stephen-colbert-omicron-school-closures;5
173;173;5416;5416;Millions of Virgin Media and Virgin Mobile customers face price rises;2022-01-05T16:04:41Z;['Hilary Osborne'];['Virgin Media', 'Media', 'Business', 'Consumer affairs', 'Money', 'UK news'];"Millions of customers of Virgin Media and Virgin Mobile are facing price increases in spring, with TV and broadband subscribers having to pay £56.40 more a year for the services from 1 March. A change in the terms and conditions for Virgin Mobile customers will introduce an annual price rise of 3.9% above January’s RPI inflation rate for their calls. Currently, prices increase each year in line with RPI. The latest RPI figure, for November, was 7.1%, and if inflation remains at this level customers will face a double-digit price increase, coming into effect in April. The increases come against a backdrop of rising prices, which has prompted economists to predict that 2022 will be the “year of the squeeze” for UK households. Virgin Media said the price rises would allow it to keep up with demand from customers, who have increased their data use dramatically since 2019. At the end of last year, customers were on average using 40% more data than in 2019, an increase driven by a switch to working from home and spending more leisure time in their living rooms. However, customers with Virgin Media’s Oomph bundled deal, which includes the mobile service alongside broadband, will be excluded from the mobile price change. So too will vulnerable customers, including those on the company’s Essential broadband package for people receiving universal credit, or its Talk Protected landline offer.
A Virgin Media spokesperson said: “While we recognise a price change is never welcome, with rising costs and our customers using their services more than ever, we are reviewing our pricing to fuel further investment in our network and services, both now and in the future. “We’re committed to providing brilliant services and excellent overall value, and consistently give our customers more for their money than anyone else.” Virgin Mobile customers have their payments split into two parts, one to cover the cost of their handset and one to cover airtime, and it is only the latter that will go up. For a customer currently paying £35 a month for an iPhone 12 and watch with an airtime plan with 12Gb of data, £25 a month pays for the devices and will not be affected. The other part of the deal will go up. If RPI remains at 7.1%, this will add £1.10 a month to their bill.";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/05/millions-of-virgin-media-and-virgin-mobile-customers-face-price-rises;2
174;174;5417;5417;Trump’s border wall and the slow decay of American soil | Carlos Sanchez;2022-01-05T16:00:37Z;['Carlos Sanchez'];['Texas', 'Mexico', 'US-Mexico border', 'US news', 'US immigration', 'Americas', 'World news'];"Several miles south of the small town of San Juan, Texas, beyond acres of onion fields, orange groves and other cash crops sits a historic cemetery and the site of the beginning of a slow decay of American soil. I hadn’t been to this area for more than a year because of the pandemic, and I was startled at how different this remote part of Texas had become. The most obvious change is the steel 18ft-high bollard fencing, among the last vestiges of Donald Trump’s glorious border wall with Mexico. Trump visited this site in June with Governor Greg Abbott to tout his accomplishments in controlling the border and to praise Abbott for taking up the anti-immigrant baton that resonates so well with the conservative voting base in Texas. The last time I came to visit this spot, no wall existed and the historic cemetery – the Eli Jackson cemetery – was under a 24-hour vigil by a Native American tribe called the Carrizo/Comecrudo, as well as other supporters who feared a border wall would destroy sacred burial land and a sacred piece of history. The Eli Jackson family built this cemetery, designated a historic landmark by the state, on land owned by Nathanial Jackson, Eli’s father. Nathaniel was a slave owner from Alabama who fell in love with and married one of his slaves, Matilda Hicks, before the two fled to the banks of the Rio Grande in 1857 and settled on the border with Mexico. Nathaniel was known for his generosity to visitors and his ranch soon began a relatively unknown line of the vaunted Underground Railroad in which fleeing slaves escaped servitude and, with the Jackson family’s help, fled to Mexico where slavery was forbidden. The Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe and its descendants also claim this area and, with the permission of the landowners, set up a camp in January 2019 to fend off any wall construction. Many of the inhabitants who camped out said they were veterans of the Keystone pipeline protests in northern Minnesota. And given the supply tent and other facilities that were erected adjacent to the Eli Jackson cemetery there was a suggestion that organizers hoped that a similarly large protest would develop in south Texas to fight the border wall.
And despite a 24-hour vigil, often by as few as one or two diehard protesters in heat and cold for nearly a year in 2019, the efforts to protect the cemetery fell victim to Covid in 2020. As federal construction crews erected Trump’s wall ever closer to the cemetery, the landowners finally told the protesters to vacate. Soon, a large sign declaring the cemetery closed and camping prohibited was posted and the steel bollards marking the wall’s arrival began to overtake the horizon less than 100 yards from the burial grounds. When I returned to this remote site, about a mile from the Rio Grande, the first thing I noticed was a road to get over an earthen flood levee and back to the cemetery was closed; a sign said the area was now a construction zone, a Trump border wall just a few yards east of the road. I found another road that circled around to the cemetery. The protesters’ area of encampment, once a cleared field, was now the site of overgrown vegetation, leaving little evidence of human habitation for the better part of a year, suggesting the border wall decay has begun. It’s a decay that marks the beginning of a no man’s land: virtually uninhabitable, threatening because of its isolation, essentially a chunk of US territory that might as well belong to Mexico. That’s because in south Texas the term border wall is a misnomer because of the unpredictability of the Rio Grande and a treaty with Mexico. While the great river is dammed and channeled along its international path through Texas, the Rio Grande can still bite back with massive and unpredictable flooding. One attempt to mitigate the threat resulted in a treaty with Mexico that was signed during the Nixon administration that prevents either side from altering the flow of the river with land impediments – something like a border wall. To protect from flooding in south Texas, a long, mostly earthen levee generally follows the route of the Rio Grande from about a mile away. So, while border walls in Arizona and California may straddle the border with Mexico, those in south Texas are typically located atop or adjacent to the levee system, meaning that this so-called protective barrier is ceding about a mile of US territory behind the wall, effectively creating a no man’s land. It was true under the wall that was built by the George W Bush administration and it’s true of the walls that were erected during the Trump administration. Beyond the threat the creation of a no man’s land has to private homeowners and their property values, this region is also rich in ecological sites along the river. One of these, called the Southmost Preserve, is a thousand-acre wildlife preserve home to one of the only two remaining large stands of native Mexican sabal palm. More than 900 acres of that preserve is now in a no man’s land south of a Bush wall and locals generally avoid it because of the potential danger a no man’s land poses. Another Bush wall runs near the historic Hidalgo Pumphouse Museum and World Birding Center in the city of Hidalgo. Several nature trails run behind this area. But many of those trails are now behind a border wall and impassable or too dangerous to enter. Critics had predicted that a Trump border wall in this region would have the same no-man’s-land result. What I didn’t realize was how quickly the negative effects of this isolated land would be felt. Aside from all the warnings to keep out when I recently visited the Jackson cemetery, there was an emptiness in this area that I had never felt before. An isolation that hinted at vulnerability. The irony of this situation is that Texas, a state that brags about its commitment to property rights, continues its fight to finish the border wall. But I noticed that there was one section of the Trump wall that was about a mile long in this area. Then there was a mile-long gap before another section of wall began. So, this barrier effectively did little to deter unauthorized immigration because the migrants simply need to walk a mile or two in either direction to go around the wall. But this barrier, this big, beautiful wall, as Trump called it, that was built to protect US citizens from the “invasion” of migrants, was only truly effective at something else: keeping US citizens away from the no man’s land that it created and ceding the territory to Mexico.

It’s got three handles for a start, and doesn’t have a lid you can wear as a hat. What’s the point, then? Well, it was conceived in the early 1960s by erstwhile Football League boss Alan Hardaker (Little England) in the petty hope of distracting clubs from the new-fangled European scene, a gambit which it would be fair to say had limited success. As a result, the competition has struggled somewhat for an identity ever since. Po’ League Cup! League Cup’s a-cold! Having said that, The Fiver has always loved it, despite its myriad dignity-stripping associations with hot brands such as Rumbelows, Littlewoods, Woolies, Timothy Whites, Bejam, MacFisheries, Our Price, Do It All, Dolcis, Owen Owen, Panda Pops, Pint of Heavy, Double Cream, Eggs, Yogurt, Beef Dripping, Wang, Mr Tom, Percy Pig and Players No 6. The same can’t be said for Liverpool, though, whose attitude towards their two-legged semi-final with Arsenal has, from the get-go, been ambivalent at best, ever since Jürgen Klopp raised the possibility of deciding it instead by a quick game of rock, paper, scissors. Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan, masterminds of the club’s 1980s four-in-a-row Milk Cup domination, will be churning in their graves.
Liverpool have now got their wish, sort of, in so much as Thursday evening’s first leg at the Emirates has been postponed. This is due to a severe outbreak of ennui at Anfield, though a significant number of players and staff, including both Klopp and his assistant Pep Lijnders, have also gone down with Covid, which doesn’t help. Consequently, the second leg at Anfield next week will become the first, the fixture at Arsenal will now be played on 20 January, and coronavirus fall-guys Leyton Orient are guaranteed to trend for the next fortnight on Social Media Disgrace Twitter, as if people don’t have enough to be up in arms about in the real world.

Age: 95. Appearance: Our most beloved national treasure. Why are we talking about David Attenborough? I love him. Oh no, is this bad news? It’s fine. He’s still with us. Luckily. Luckily?? I don’t know how to break this to you, but Attenborough has had an accident. He’s been injured. I don’t know if I can take the stress. Who is responsible for this? Who? It was a cactus. Right, that’s it. Time to punch a cactus in the face. Don’t be stupid. Attenborough wasn’t ambushed in his bed by a cactus. He was filming a new show, and touched one. It stabbed him even though he was protected by thick gloves. Why would you want to touch a cactus? To prove how dangerous they are. Point proved, I guess. And also because Attenborough is as hard as nails. He was once in a boat that got caught in an Indonesian whirlpool. He trapped a caiman in Guyana. He’s been crawled over by a bunch of wild mountain gorillas. He has met cannibals, and was knocked unconscious while filming dolphins in the Bahamas. There’s tough, and then there’s Attenborough. I know, but he’s 95 years old now. We should protect him. We are protecting him. He hurt his hand filming the new BBC series The Green Planet. It is exclusively about plants. You can’t get less dangerous than that. Tell that to the cactus. OK, fine, so I lied. In fact, according to Attenborough, The Green Planet will remind us that plants are often as dangerous as animals. Really? Yup. He has said of the series that “plants fight one another, plants strangle one another and you can actually see that happening”. Great, now I’m terrified of my garden. But don’t be worried about Attenborough. No human being on the planet has done more to educate the public about the incredible world we live in. Putting himself in harm’s way for a living has enriched humanity. He has taught us all so much. I’m pretty sure we already knew that cacti were spiky, though. But have we ever seen someone submit to their spikes like this? Couldn’t it have been someone less wonderful? But what would be the point of that? Attenborough was able to give a detailed explanation of the evolutionary benefit of having spikes. If it had been someone like Piers Morgan, he would have just spent a morning writing 3,000 angry tweets about wanting to cancel cacti. Do say: “David Attenborough has taught us to love all life on Earth.” Don’t say: “Except for cacti, which should all be burned to death.”;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/05/david-attenborough-vs-the-cactus-how-the-95-year-old-was-stabbed-by-a-dangerous-plant;1
177;177;5420;5420;Macron rebuke to unvaccinated citizens incurs anger in parliament;2022-01-05T15:48:21Z;['Angelique Chrisafis'];['Emmanuel Macron', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'France', 'Coronavirus', 'Europe', 'Infectious diseases', 'World news'];"Emmanuel Macron faced criticism from political opponents and heated scenes in parliament on Wednesday after he gave a deliberately provocative warning to unvaccinated French people, saying he would make their lives as difficult as possible by curbing their access to spaces such as cafés and restaurants. A crucial parliamentary debate on introducing a proposed Covid-19 “vaccine pass” for entry to areas such museums and long-distance trains was to resume on Wednesday afternoon. The debate had been suspended just before 2am on Wednesday as lawmakers expressed outrage at Macron’s newspaper interview in which he said the 5 million people who had not had vaccines against the coronavirus were “irresponsible” and that he really wanted to “put them in the shit” by making their daily lives as complicated as possible. The French government spokesman, Gabriel Attal, warned there would be a “supersonic” rise in Covid cases in France in the coming days and that infections were reaching stratospheric levels in the Île-de-France area around Paris as well as some in other regions. He said the situation in hospitals could worsen in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, France registered a record number of 335,000 infections over the previous 24 hours.
The government, in a hardening of current rules, is seeking to make it mandatory for people to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination to enter cafés, restaurants, museums, cinemas and theatres, or to use long-distance trains. Repeated disruptions and clashes in parliament, as well as hundreds of proposed amendments, are leaving the government struggling to push the law through before its deadline of 15 January. In an interview with readers of Le Parisien newspaper published on Wednesday, Macron, the French president, deliberately used the verb “emmerder”, which is derived from the word “merde” or “shit” and is widely used in France and considered vulgar slang. He said that he “really wanted” to put the non-vaccinated “in the shit” by making their lives very complicated and “limiting as much as possible their access to activities in social life”. Macron said: “We have to tell [the unvaccinated] ... you will no longer be able to go to a restaurant, you will no longer be able to go for a coffee, you will no longer be able to go to the theatre, you will no longer be able to go to the cinema. We will continue to do this, to the end. This is the strategy.” He explained that he could not force French people to get vaccinated on pain of prison or fines but life could be made very difficult for them without a vaccine.
In parliament, opposition parties slammed Macron’s choice of language as unfit for a president and worrying in terms of voting through the new law. Christian Jacob, president of the opposition, rightwing Les Républicains party, told parliament: “A president cannot say such things ... I’m in favour of the vaccine pass but I cannot back a text whose objective is to put French people in the shit.” Damien Abad, from the same party, slammed what he called unworthy, irresponsible and premeditated remarks which showed “childish cynicism”. On the left, there was outrage over more of Macron’s comments, when, referring to unvaccinated people, he said that when some people’s freedom threatened those of others they became irresponsible, adding: “Someone irresponsible is not a citizen.”
Mathilde Panot, head of the parliamentary group for the left’s La France Insoumise party, told the house: “We won’t keep debating a text you presented as a protection of the French people and which is in fact a text to put a part of the French population in the shit and which has invented [the notion of] stripping French citizenship – by saying irresponsible people are no longer French citizens.” Macron is expected to seek re-election in the presidential elections this April. However, his key challenger, Valérie Pécresse, of Les Républicains, told French TV that he was dividing the nation by making some citizens seem better than others. “It’s not up to the president of the republic to pick out good and bad French people,” Pécresse said. France needed a government to “unite people and calm things down”, she added. But government figures and Macron allies stood by the president’s calculated choice of words and the strategy to make daily life very hard for unvaccinated people. Macron is no stranger to rows over off-the-cuff comments or slang, telling interviewers last month that he regretted some of his comments of the past five years, saying: “I’ve learned to have a lot more respect for everyone.” But the vehemence of his comments about unvaccinated people and his deliberate choice of hard language was aimed at his own electorate, which is almost entirely vaccinated, and it was also a pre-election message to address the widespread exasperation at the Covid crisis in France.
Although France has historically had more vaccine sceptics than many of its neighbours, it has one of the highest Covid-19 vaccination rates in the EU. A majority of people is in favour of vaccination; about 90% of French people aged 12 and over are vaccinated. The number of unvaccinated people in French hospital critical wards is higher than those who are vaccinated, and the health minister has said that the small minority of unvaccinated people in France, numbering around 5 million, is too many. Christophe Castaner, a key Macron ally and head of his grouping in parliament, said: “The president’s comments gave clarity, and we need that at this difficult moment for the country.” Castaner said that the president was giving a view that lots of French people shared. Olivier Véran, the health minister, told parliament the aim of Macron’s entire interview was “the protection of the French people”. Marc Fesneau, minister for parliamentary relations, said: “We need unvaccinated people to hear the message being sent to them by the government, parliament and the president – which is a message of responsibility.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/macron-rebuke-to-unvaccinated-citizens-incurs-anger-in-parliament;7
178;178;5421;5421;US teacher accused of giving Covid vaccine to teenager against mother’s wishes;2022-01-05T15:48:13Z;['Alexandra Villarreal'];['New York', 'Coronavirus', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'US news', 'US education'];A New York biology teacher is facing up to four years in prison for allegedly giving a Covid-19 vaccine to a 17-year-old boy against his mother’s wishes – and despite not being a trained medical professional with authorization to do so. Laura Russo, who teaches at Herricks high school on Long Island, reportedly administered the jab to one of her son’s friends after he asked for it. The teen’s mother had not wanted him to be inoculated against the deadly virus and did not consent to the injection. Video published by NBC New York allegedly shows Russo giving the shot at her residence in Sea Cliff, a village on Long Island. “There you go, at-home vaccine,” someone says in the background. The boy later told his mother what had happened. She alerted the police, who arrested Russo on New Year’s Eve after finding that she was not a medical professional and was not authorized to give vaccines. Russo has been charged with unauthorized practice of a profession under New York state education law, a felony offense that carries a sentence of up to four years, the Washington Post reported. She has been released and is expected to appear in court on 21 January, police said. District officials for the Herricks public schools said the incident was not school-related and Russo “has been removed from the classroom and reassigned pending the outcome of the investigation”. It is unclear how Russo obtained the vial of an approved Covid-19 vaccine, which only medical professionals and healthcare facilities are able to order, according to the Post. Experts frown upon unauthorized Covid-19 vaccinations as generally dangerous and ill-advised, given the complexities of administering the jab. Intramuscular injections like the Covid-19 vaccines require specific training even for medical professionals, and the mRNA technology can break down if it is not stored and handled correctly. “Besides being illegal, it’s just not a smart thing to do,” Aaron Glatt, the chair of the department of medicine at Mount Sinai South Nassau, told NBC New York. “An authorized, licensed professional should be providing vaccines to know how to give them properly – to make sure if there’s a complication, that can be dealt with immediately and very efficiently.”;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/new-york-teacher-covid-vaccine-teenager;1
179;179;5422;5422;Maureen Lipman attacks casting of Helen Mirren as former Israeli PM Golda Meir;2022-01-05T15:45:00Z;['Andrew Pulver'];['Film', 'Helen Mirren', 'Maureen Lipman', 'Biopics', 'Judaism', 'Culture', 'Religion', 'World news', 'UK news', 'Race', 'Israel', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'Patrick Marber', 'Stage'];"Maureen Lipman has criticised the casting of Helen Mirren as Golda Meir in a forthcoming film about the former Israeli prime minister, saying that the character’s Jewishness is “integral”. In comments reported by the Jewish Chronicle, Lipman said she “disagreed” with Mirren’s casting. She added: “I’m sure [Mirren] will be marvellous, but it would never be allowed for Ben Kingsley to play Nelson Mandela. You just couldn’t even go there.”
Meir, who died in 1978, was Israel’s prime minister between 1969 and 74. The new film, called Golda, directed by Israeli film-maker Guy Nattiv is set during the Yom Kippur war in 1973 and started shooting in November 2021. Production stills showing Mirren under heavy makeup were released, with Mirren, who is not Jewish, commenting: “Golda Meir was a formidable, intransigent and powerful leader … I only hope I do her justice!” The Jewish Chronicle’s piece cited a number of controversial instances of “Jewface”, including Tamsin Greig’s recent suggestion that she ‘probably’ should not have been cast in the sitcom Friday Night Dinner and the row over a stage production of the musical Falsettos in 2019, which contained no Jewish cast or crew members. It also quoted actor and comic Sarah Silverman’s comments on the mooted casting of Kathryn Hahn as Joan Rivers in a TV series: “Right now, representation fucking matters. It has to also finally matter for Jews as well. Especially Jewish women.” In contrast, the playwright and director Patrick Marber was quoted in the Jewish Chronicle article as objecting to the primacy of “lived experienced” in casting decisions, saying: “I fucking hate that expression. Because ‘lived experience’ is sort of a denial of what creativity is and denies the actor the fundamental challenge and right to become someone else to impersonate another human being from another time, from another culture from another religion and another sexuality and other gender.” Marber added: “I think a Gentile can play a Jew and a Jew can play a Gentile. I don’t like it when someone plays a Jew and gets it wrong. [But] I don’t like quotas.”";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/maureen-lipman-attacks-casting-of-helen-mirren-as-former-israeli-pm;5
180;180;5423;5423;Palestinian man to end hunger strike after Israel agrees to release;2022-01-05T15:43:54Z;['Bethan McKernan'];['Palestinian territories', 'Israel', 'World news', 'Middle East and north Africa'];"A Palestinian man on a hunger strike in protest against detention without charge has agreed to end his fast after a deal was struck for his release owing to fears of unrest if he died. Hisham Abu Hawash, 40, a construction worker from Dura in the West Bank, had previously served time in an Israeli jail after pleading guilty to terrorism offences related to membership of Islamic Jihad. He was rearrested and has been held without charge or trial for more than a year, and began refusing food in August. His lawyer said on Tuesday night that Abu Hawash had agreed to end the 141-day strike – believed to be the longest by a Palestinian prisoner since 2013 – after a deal was reached between Israeli and Palestinian Authority (PA) officials to release him next month. A medical team from the International Committee of the Red Cross that visited the prisoner last week said he was in “critical condition”, warning of “potentially irreversible health consequences and possible tragic loss of life”.
The deal comes amid mounting support for Abu Hawash in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the form of street demonstrations, along with a widespread campaign for his release on social media, where pictures of the gaunt prisoner lying in a hospital bed have circulated widely. Islamic Jihad, the second-largest militant group in Gaza, had threatened revenge if he died in custody, and Hamas called the issue a “red line”. The married father of five, who denies being a member of Islamic Jihad, is being held under Israel’s practice of administrative detention, which allows suspects’ arrest for renewable six-month terms without charge or access to the evidence against them. Israel says the measure – which is also practised by the PA – is necessary for foiling terrorist attacks and to avoid revealing sensitive intelligence sources. Rights groups allege it is used excessively and routinely by Israeli authorities and denies individuals the right to due process. Abu Hawash’s release date of 26 February will mark the end of his current six-month detention period, a compromise struck with PA officials that allowed Israel to claim it had decided not to renew his detention, rather than shorten it. In return, the PA agreed to ensure the prisoner “will not return to terrorism”. After accepting the terms of the deal, Abu Hawash, who had begun to lose consciousness for long periods of time, broke his fast on Tuesday night with a few sips of tea. He had previously refused all medical intervention and stopped consuming small amounts of sugar and salt six weeks ago. He was transferred to an Israeli civilian hospital on 26 December and will remain there under armed guard until his release. The news was met with celebrations across the Palestinian territories on Tuesday night, while the Prisoners’ Club, which represents former and current Palestinian prisoners, hailed the strike as a victory. It said Abu Hawash had previously spent eight years in Israeli prisons, more than half of it in administrative detention. Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are subject to Israeli military courts, while Jewish settlers in the territory answer to the civilian justice system. According to the Palestinian rights group Addameer, 500 Palestinians are currently being held under the measure.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/palestinian-man-end-hunger-strike-israel-agrees-release;1
181;181;5424;5424;Giles’s scattergun broadsides suggest a man who has gone as far as he can | Andy Bull;2022-01-05T15:30:36Z;['Andy Bull'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'Ashley Giles', 'England cricket team', 'The Ashes', 'Cricket', 'Sport'];"Back in 2005, Ashley Giles played what is still one of my favourite Test innings, when he made 59 on the fifth day of the fifth Test at the Oval. It was his top score in Test cricket at the time his team needed it the most. And because it was played in the shadow of Kevin Pietersen’s 158 at the other end, it went almost unnoticed. Which felt characteristic. Giles always seemed like that team’s Guildenstern, a steady lower-order bat and a spinner who often didn’t turn the ball at all. We called him the Wheelie Bin because of his ungainly action, or the King of Spain, because of a misprint on a souvenir mug. He hated the nicknames, and, understandably enough, resented the idea that he was being laughed at. Because, of course, he took his game seriously. He had to. Giles operated on the reaches of his own talent, and it was hard work out there. There was a prickliness to him that occasionally burst into the open. Like the time he marched into the press box in 2007 and confronted a journalist who had teased him in print for having the “temerity to remark that Tendulkar’s batting prowess had waned a little”. Giles didn’t like that at all. The journalist explained he was only being ironic. “What’s irony?” Giles shouted.
You could hear some of that side of him in his latest interviews in Australia where, as the England and Wales Cricket Board’s managing director of men’s cricket, he had to try to explain how and why England had managed to make such a mess of an Ashes series for which they had spent two years planning. It was an odd interview, which contained criticisms of previous England teams (“in the 90s that was accepted as normal for England leaderships and they got away with it, we set our standards much higher than that”), of “armchair selectors”, of England’s spinners (“we’ve got to have a spin resource that allows us to bowl much more overs of spin”), of fast bowlers (“we need a variation in our bowling attack but we need pace”), and of batsmen (“with first innings scores of 147, 236, 185, we’re not winning many Test matches”), as well as digs at county cricket (“I think there is a dearth of leadership and in the county game”) and the international schedule. Giles also said he was at peace with the idea that he was accountable for it all. He just didn’t sound like he believed it. He came across as thin-skinned and indignant that he wasn’t being given more credit for his own modest achievements. “When I came into the job we were fifth in the world in Test cricket, third in the world in Twenty20 cricket and No 1 in the world in ODIs. We’re now fourth, first in T20 and second in ODIs.”
Now Giles is working on his review of what went wrong. He said he didn’t want to go into his ideas for “how I want to take this team forward and improve our red-ball cricket”, but he still gave a good idea of what his conclusions are likely to be. “It’s been an extraordinary year and I think we can look at the cricket-specific stuff but we also need to look at the other stuff, particularly having 18 scheduled Test matches,” he said. “It’s a huge amount of cricket we’re playing and in a time of Covid it’s been pretty horrendous at times.” The players are reaching “their very top limit” of what they can deal with. On top of that, Giles said, what is needed now is systemic change, collective responsibility, and collective solutions. “We can make whatever changes we want. You can change me, change the head coach, change the captain. But we’re only setting up future leaders for failure.” Which underplays the degree to which getting the leadership team in place could transform the sport in this country. In the short term, the difference between a good side and a bad one often is as simple as a change in the coach and the team culture. Just ask Eddie Jones. And the simple truth is, everything is better in English cricket when the England team are winning. If Giles is right and more systemic change is needed, the pressing question is whether, given his track record in the job, he is the right man to lead it, given that he made such a mess of the (well-intentioned) rotation policy, and the mistake of binning the head selector to load more responsibility onto the coach.
Same goes for Tom Harrison, the ECB’s chief executive, who, though not directly responsible for the England team’s performance, has had a hand in the congested schedule, the collapse of the Pakistan tour, the mismanagement of the racism scandal, and who also blew a ridiculous amount on a needless launch of a divisive new competition, the Hundred, which is now the single greatest obstacle to sorting out the first-class cricket schedule. And yet Harrison continues. As for Giles, he looks now like he did as a player; a man trying hard to prove he can do it but who has gone as far as he can on the talents he has. “This is a good bunch of guys here,” the 48-year-old said. No one ever said they weren’t. No one ever said that was the point, either.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/giless-scattergun-broadsides-suggest-a-man-who-has-gone-as-far-as-he-can;4
182;182;5425;5425;Italy returns Parthenon fragment to Greece amid UK row over marbles ;2022-01-05T15:23:33Z;['Angela Giuffrida'];['Parthenon marbles', 'Greece', 'Italy', 'UK news', 'Foreign policy', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'Europe', 'Heritage', 'Politics', 'Sculpture', 'Art', 'World news', 'Museums'];"Italy is returning a fragment belonging to the Parthenon’s eastern frieze to Greece in a breakthrough deal that could renew pressure on Britain to repatriate the 2,500-year-old Parthenon marbles removed by Lord Elgin in the early 19th century. The marble fragment, which depicts the foot of a goddess, either Peitho or Artemis, peeking out from beneath an elaborate tunic, is currently held at the Antonino Salinas Regional Archaeological Museum in Palermo, Sicily. It was originally bought by the University of Palermo from the widow of Robert Fagan, the British consul for Sicily and Malta, after his death in 1816. The artefact is being returned on a four-year loan as part of a cultural exchange agreement between Sicily and Greece, with the intention for the loan period to be extended by a further four years. However, the move back to Greece could eventually become permanent.
In return, the Acropolis Museum in Athens will loan the Palermo museum a 5th-century BC headless statue of the goddess Athena, as well as an 8th-century BC amphora. The deal, which includes an exchange of cultural initiatives between the two museums, comes after several years of negotiations between Sicilian and Greek authorities. “Sending back to the context of its origins a small, but significant, fragment belonging to the Parthenon has a very strong symbolic value,” said Sicily’s councillor for culture, Alberto Samonà. “It is also a response to the international debate [about the Parthenon artefacts]. But I don’t want to get into that debate. For us, this is a gesture of friendship – Greece and Sicily are two areas of the Mediterranean that share a common story.” The fragment was loaned to Greece in 2002 and in 2008. Samonà said the latest transfer could become permanent, but that it would be up to the Italian culture ministry to take the measures needed to make that happen. It is not known how Fagan, an amateur archaeologist, acquired the fragment, although one theory suggests it might have been given to him by Elgin, the British aristocrat who excavated the bulk of the ancient Parthenon marbles between 1801 and 1804 before selling them to the British Museum in 1816, where the artefacts are currently on display. Greece has long fought for the marbles to be repatriated from the UK. In November, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, demanded that Britain return the marbles to Greece, while at the same time offering to loan some Greek historical treasures to the British Museum. In response, Downing Street said returning the marbles was a matter for the British Museum. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, had previously said the marbles would remain in Britain, arguing that they were legally acquired.";https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/05/italy-returns-parthenon-marbles-fragment-greece-uk-row;3
183;183;5426;5426;Rare kingfisher sighting in Preston draws thousands;2022-01-05T15:21:11Z;['Josh Halliday'];['Birds', 'Preston', 'Lancashire', 'North of England', 'Wildlife', 'UK news'];It is perhaps the biggest American star to visit Preston in years. A “spectacular” shaggy-crested belted kingfisher has drawn several thousand people to a nature reserve in Lancashire for one of the bird’s few recorded UK sightings in more than 100 years. The North American bird usually migrates to Mexico or the Caribbean for winter but is thought to have ended up in Preston after getting blown across the ocean by an Atlantic storm. Nick Moran, of the British Trust for Ornithology, said it was only the fifth recorded sighting of a belted kingfisher in the UK since 1908 – and the first “truly twitchable” one in years because of the length of its stay. The striking-looking bird was first spotted in October but has drawn interest from birdwatchers across the country after seemingly taking up residence at Brockholes nature reserve in Preston. George Shannon, who recorded one of its earliest sightings, said he was blown away when the belted kingfisher landed in front of him: “I got my binoculars on it and genuinely couldn’t believe the image I was seeing. I thought ‘it’s a belted kingfisher but it can’t possibly be a belted kingfisher’. My heart was pounding out of my chest.” It is only the second time since 1908 that a belted kingfisher has been recorded in the UK outside Cornwall or the Isles of Scilly, where they usually make landfall. Tony Baker, a local site manager at the RSPB, said he went to see the bird before Christmas along with 300 to 400 keen birdwatchers – but estimates it will have been seen by “several thousand” people by now. “A lot of birdwatchers become very interested in chasing rarities and adding new species to their life lists and this is one of those that turns up very, very rarely so it generates an enormous amount of excitement,” he said. “Apart from the fact it’s very rare, it’s also a fairly spectacular species that everybody can appreciate. It’s a terrific thing to see.”;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/05/rare-kingfisher-sighting-in-preston-draws-thousands;4

Coutinho, who can operate as a wide player or attacking midfielder, has started only five games this season, the most recent of those a month ago. He tested positive for Covid last week but was said by Barcelona to be in good health. The Brazil international had five successful years in the Premier League with Liverpool, and Villa believe they could get him to spark again. Barcelona have made attempts to sell him since summer 2019 without finding a buyer.

185;185;5428;5428;Text appeal: Ceefax recreated by 20-year-old Northern Irish man;2022-01-05T15:00:36Z;['Jim Waterson'];['BBC', 'Computing', 'Television', 'Television', 'Media', 'Technology', 'Culture'];"If you find news websites too overwhelming, too fast and too full of distractions then this might be the solution: a recreation of the BBC’s Ceefax service featuring up-to-date headlines, an accurate weather map and the latest stock market prices. Nathan Dane, 20, has spent the last six years building a simulation of the BBC’s defunct text-based information service. It takes in data from the BBC’s existing website and repurposes it in the distinctively blocky font that was ubiquitous on television sets during the 1980s and 1990s.
“It’s as close a recreation as I can make it,” said Dane from his home in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, where he has a separate screen at his desk for showing news headlines from his recreation of Ceefax. “I do find it really useful myself. If I’m sitting in work eating my lunch I can just stick that on and get up to date. You’re not flicking about between websites – you have all the information you need on a page but without all the distraction.” At its peak, tens of millions of Britons used BBC Ceefax and its commercial equivalent, Teletext, to check news headlines, find travel information or wait an infuriatingly long time for a quiz answer to be revealed. Individual stories were often split across multiple pages, meaning it could take minutes to fully comprehend an article if you were unlucky enough to load halfway through a piece. Only a few sentences of text fitted on each screen, forcing writers to develop the skills to produce concise stories. But the limitations and slowness of a system designed in 1974 may be increasingly attractive in a world of unlimited choice, while the cluttered advertising-heavy designs of many modern websites have made people nostalgic for the simplicity of Ceefax.
The BBC closed the original Ceefax service as part of the transition to digital television broadcasts, with Northern Ireland being the last region of the UK to lose access. “We had Ceefax in this part of the world until 2012, which is probably the only reason I remember it,” said Dane, who works for a digital signage company. “I have a great interest in all the old broadcast-TV type stuff. It’s really the service that I remember looking through when I was wee.” Dane’s recreation features a weather map (page 401) based on data from the Met Office that accurately recreates the current forecast on a map of the UK using the limited Ceefax colour palette. The Premier League football table (page 324) is up to date. A selection of national, foreign and local stories can be accessed through the headlines section (page 101). Some fans have also set up YouTube streams looping through Ceefax pages with muzak in the background, recreating the way the BBC used to fill overnight schedules on its channels.
The small but thriving online Teletext community, which is centred on a group on the chat service Discord, already helps run a separate long-running service called Teefax – although it does not use the same BBC styling. There are also dozens of teletext artists who challenge themselves to use the limited colour palette. One of them, Dan Farriond, said: “It’s a great gateway because it’s very simple, it’s built on 1970s technology, it’s simple to get your head around technology-wise. It’s the pure aesthetic of it and the simplicity. You only have a limited number of colours. A lot of the design decisions are made for you.” Dane, who runs his Ceefax server from his home, said his service was remarkably stable. When Facebook went offline in November he proudly tweeted a story about Mark Zuckerberg’s company with the caption: “Ceefax, however, remains unaffected.”";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/05/text-appeal-ceefax-recreated-by-20-year-old-northern-irish-man;5
186;186;5429;5429; Bill Bernstein’s best photograph: joy and humanity in a homeless centre;2022-01-05T15:00:02Z;['Daniel Dylan Wray'];['Art and design', 'Photography', 'Culture', 'Homelessness', 'Poverty', 'Society'];"In the 1970s I lived in SoHo in New York, which is not far from the Bowery, but the two districts were like separate universes. SoHo was full of artists and creative types but the Bowery was known as the place where you ended up when you were at the bottom of the barrel. There were a lot of flophouses and a lot of alcoholism and drug use. It was the darkest place in New York City for a long time. The Bowery Mission is a Christian rescue centre for homeless people. Only men are allowed to stay overnight but it feeds anybody. I used to go there around Thanksgiving and Christmas time to help serve dinner. The face-to-face contact and interactions I had with people meant that I always felt a real connection with them, and it also made me grateful for what I had in my own life. In the 1990s there was a lot of focus on homelessness in New York City and money and public attention were put towards trying to end it. And then, in the early 2000s, the interest faded. It’s not that the problem went away – on the contrary – but for some reason we weren’t talking about it any more. That bothered me, so I thought to myself: what can I do? I figured as a photographer I could create something that brings a little attention to these people and their situation. So I contacted the Bowery Mission and asked to do some portraits of the centre’s regular users.
They gave me a room upstairs to work in. If you want to get a meal at the Bowery Mission, you have to also attend a religious service. So I’d wait until people had eaten and listened to the sermon and were chilled out and relaxed and only then would I approach to ask if I could photograph them. I needed to be very careful because in a lot of ways these people are very fragile, but I was also surprised by how much – had I not known they were homeless – I would have never guessed their circumstances. My plan was to focus on faces and eyes, because we so often walk down the street and see somebody and we don’t want to actually look at them or engage. Not to sound corny but I was interested in trying to get into their story and their soul. I was interested when couples arrived at the centre as it was clear that they lived together on the streets. These guys were such a great pair. When they smiled, I was like: that’s the picture. I shot with something called an Octabank, which is like a gigantic umbrella that’s about six feet wide and means that the whole face is beautifully lit. It’s more often used in fashion photography. A lot of pictures of homeless people are really sad. I didn’t want to do that. There is some joy in these people, and that’s what I wanted to show. That’s why I lit it the way I did. And from the poses I wanted to get the depth of feeling of them as humans but I also wanted to get over the fact that you would hang with some of these people – they’re cool! I choose deliberately not to publish their names out of consideration for their privacy and because I wanted to focus on the faces and humanity of the people captured in the moment in the project. With these two it was clear that they had each other, and that was pretty much it in their lives at that point. I wanted to give a sense of what their relationship felt like. I was trying to get them to centre themselves in front of the camera, and just be who they were and not try to do anything special or performative. Many of us are only a couple of steps away from something like homelessness. I was feeling helpless about a situation in my city that I thought was terrible and a life condition I saw every day when I walked out of my door. The worse the situation becomes the more it is normalised and your sense of helplessness is eventually numbed. I exhibited the work in the Mission headquarters in Midtown. We blew up eight or nine of the photographs to around 6ft by 4ft. You’re looking at these huge eyes and faces and the impact of having all those pictures in one room was pretty overwhelming. I think they felt really special having all the lights and cameras and attention on them when doing this project. I hope that feeling lasted for a while. Bill Bernstein’s CV

187;187;5430;5430;Inflation adds £15 to Britain’s Christmas groceries bills;2022-01-05T14:58:36Z;['Joanna Partridge'];['Food & drink industry', 'Supermarkets', 'Business', 'Tesco', 'Ocado', 'Retail industry', 'Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'UK news', 'J Sainsbury', 'Waitrose', 'Aldi', 'Lidl', 'Morrisons', 'Inflation'];"Shoppers in Britain had to pay more for their Christmas groceries as price inflation jumped to 3.5% in December, according to retail industry figures that showed a sharp rise in the price of beef, savoury snacks and skincare in particular.
Grocery price inflation added nearly £15 to an average monthly bill over the festive period, according to analysts at the data firm Kantar. The monthly increase was the sharpest since January 2018, bar a short period in spring 2020 when retailers suspended promotions to keep products available during panic buying at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. While the prices of some items – including fresh bacon, bath and shower products and spirits – have fallen in recent weeks, Kantar found grocery price inflation accelerated in December, up almost 1.5 percentage points on the 2.1% level seen in November. Christmas spending pushed total grocery sales to £11.7bn in the four weeks to 26 December – just 0.2% below the record established at the end of 2020, when supermarket sales benefited while pubs and restaurants were closed because of Covid restrictions. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: “People seized the chance to enjoy Christmas with friends and family after last year’s muted festivities. The data suggests that, while there weren’t formal rules in place across the UK this year, many people celebrated at home again due to Omicron.”
Despite the spread of the Omicron variant, shoppers returned in greater numbers to supermarkets to fill their trolleys, with the largest number of in-store visits in December since March 2020. In comparison, online sales fell by 3.7% compared with a year earlier, accounting for just over 12% of total sales. The busiest shopping day of the year was 23 December – typically a bumper day for pre-Christmas spending. Analysts viewed this as evidence of shoppers’ confidence that supply chain disruption earlier in the year would not prevent them from being able to buy their turkey, brussels sprouts and Christmas pudding at the supermarket.
Tesco, Britain’s biggest supermarket chain, maintained dominance over its rivals during the crucial Christmas trading period, increasing its market share to 27.9% over the 12 weeks to Boxing Day. This marks an increase of 0.6 percentage points on a year earlier.
Retailers found it challenging to beat the record for pre-Christmas sales set in 2020, when hospitality venues had to close and could only serve takeaway food and drink in some areas of the UK. However, sales rose among all the leading supermarket chains compared with the final 12 weeks of 2019. Discounters Aldi and Lidl experienced a slight improvement to their market share, as did Waitrose. The online grocer Ocado, which has a joint venture with Marks & Spencer, was the only retailer which grew its sales compared with a year earlier. Consumers splashed out on premium ranges, taking sales of supermarkets’ own-brand luxury products to record levels, as shoppers spent £627m in December alone – an increase of almost 7% for such items compared with 2020. Traditional treats such as mince pies and chocolates proved popular, but sales of newer plant-based foods also grew before Veganuary, a period when consumers promise to only eat vegan food during the first month of the year.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/grocery-inflation-adds-15-to-britains-christmas-bills;7
188;188;5431;5431;Hundreds of UK care homes closing their doors as Omicron spreads;2022-01-05T14:40:59Z;['Robert Booth'];['Social care', 'Care workers', 'Older people', 'Health policy', 'NHS', 'Coronavirus', 'Health', 'Society', 'Politics', 'Public services policy', 'UK news'];"Hundreds of care homes are closing their doors to new admissions because of the rapid spread of Omicron, increasing pressure on embattled hospitals that are unable to discharge patients into the community. Of the homes operated by MHA, one of the largest not-for-profit care providers in the UK, 70% have now shut their doors to new residents because of Covid outbreaks and staff shortages. At Four Seasons Healthcare, one of the largest private operators, 40% of homes it operates have recorded two or more cases, which means, under government guidance, they should not accept new arrivals. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, described the trend as “very concerning” and said hospital bosses were reporting that delayed discharges were significantly adding to pressure. “This isn’t good for patients as we know patient outcomes deteriorate if patients are medically fit to discharge but can’t leave hospital,” he said. He said it was also making it more difficult to find room for patients including serious cases coming via accident and emergency departments. On Wednesday, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said temporary settings may need to be set up to get people out of hospitals, many of which have declared critical incidents amid a staff absence rate of 10% on average across England. “This issue of staff absence is not just in the hospitals; it is in primary care and community care and of course in social care,” Taylor said. “If you have people in hospital who don’t need to be there, that adds another pressure to an already challenging situation.”
Some health trusts have already set up temporary care facilities on floors of hotels with live-in staff recruited from abroad, including in Bristol and Plymouth. Different local health teams have been advising care homes affected by outbreaks to close to new admissions for 14 or 28 days. The shutdowns come as Covid deaths in care homes jumped more than 50% in the last week of 2021, according to official figures, but they still remain far lower than in earlier waves. Sixty-five people died from Covid in England’s care homes in the week to 31 December compared with about 1,850 in the peak of the January 2021 wave, apparently confirming hopes about Omicron’s relative mildness and the effectiveness of the vaccine.
Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA, which has closed 62 of its 89 homes to new admissions because of Department of Health and Social Care guidelines around outbreaks, said: “The current rules around outbreaks mean that care homes find themselves closed to new admissions, leaving older people staying in hospital longer than necessary or not getting the care that they need.” Vic Rayner, the chief executive of the National Care Forum, said: “This isn’t just difficult for hospitals, but also for unpaid carers who are under enormous pressure and won’t be able to get respite or find places for their loved ones to get the round the clock care they really need.” At MHA 10% of staff are currently unavailable for work, mirroring the situation in the NHS where medical students are being primed to be deployed on wards. To get staff back to work, Taylor has urged the government to consider dropping the period of isolation after a positive test from seven to five days “if the science indicates it is safe”. HC-One, the largest private care home provider, said 869 staff – about 4% of the workforce – were off with either a positive test or awaiting results, while about 500 residents had tested positive, or 3%. MHA is also calling for the government to ease restrictions on visitors into homes that are in outbreak, which are currently supposed to be limited to a single essential caregiver for up to 28 days after the outbreak begins. “Once an outbreak is declared (often involving only two cases of Covid), everyone living in these homes can have essential care visits but no broader friends and family may visit for up to four weeks,” Monaghan said. “Meanwhile, in the general population, if we test negative six and seven days after a positive Covid test, we may return to socialising straight away. This is a huge disparity and it is time for the government to look again at the scientific evidence and review whether these differing approaches are really needed.”";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/hundreds-uk-care-homes-closing-doors-covid-omicron-spreads;7
189;189;5432;5432;Scotland cuts Covid self-isolation period from 10 to seven days;2022-01-05T14:32:47Z;['Severin Carrell'];['Scotland', 'Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'Nicola Sturgeon', 'Business'];"Nicola Sturgeon has cut Scotland’s self-isolation period from 10 to seven days, after sustained pressure from businesses and opposition parties to address soaring staff absences. The first minister told MSPs on Wednesday her government’s highly cautious stance on the 10-day isolation period was being softened after data from hospitals suggested the Omicron variant was less medically severe than feared. Sturgeon also confirmed Scotland would adopt a new rule on taking PCR tests announced in England earlier on Wednesday, to cut the number of PCR tests being taken unnecessarily and to conserve supplies. She said the requirement for someone with a positive lateral flow test to immediately book a PCR would be dropped, as long as they did not have symptoms. That new rule will come into force on Thursday 6 January, rather than 11 January as in England. Ministers in England and in Wales cut self-isolation to a week in December after deciding the impact of extended self-isolation on public services and businesses was not outweighed by Omicron’s risk to health and critical care services. In a recalled session of the Scottish parliament, where she faced heavy criticism over the quality of NHS data in Scotland, Sturgeon said adults could end their self-isolation after seven days if they had no fever and had had two negative lateral flow tests. Close contacts will not have to self-isolate if they are fully vaccinated, have no symptoms and record negative tests every day for seven days, under new rules which take effect from midnight on Wednesday. Anyone not fully vaccinated will need to remain in isolation for 10 days – a measure expected to drive up vaccination rates. She acknowledged the new rules were “more proportionate and sustainable and less restrictive”. Sturgeon’s move came after Scottish hospitals said their services were under significant strain because of staff absences. The train operator ScotRail cut hundreds of services this month owing to staff shortages. Hospitality companies and retailers have struggled to stay open, and have complained bitterly about the impact on their businesses. While Scotland has recorded its highest-ever Covid infections – 20,217 on Monday, a figure partly inflated by results delayed by the holiday weekend – rates of critical illness have remained stable.
There were 1,223 people with Covid in hospital on Wednesday, more than double the number seven days ago, but the number in intensive care remained stable, at about 52 or 53 people a day. Five more people had died after a positive Covid test, taking the total under that measure in Scotland to 9,872. The first minister came under pressure from opposition parties over the quality of government data after it emerged that John Swinney, her Covid recovery minister, had used old survey figures to defend Scotland’s restrictions. Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, said Swinney had used “misleading data for scoring petty political points” on Tuesday after he quoted Office for National Statistics survey results from mid-December to claim infection rates in England, at 1 in 20, were twice those in Scotland, at 1 in 40. Sturgeon confirmed the latest ONS data showed Scotland’s estimated infection rate was 1 in 20 last week, compared with 1 in 15 for England. English regional data was more varied, from 1 in 10 in London to 1 in 30 in other regions. It was 1 in 25 in Northern Ireland and 1 in 20 in Wales. She denied Swinney had used misleading figures but acknowledged “this isn’t a competition”. Sturgeon was warned by Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, and Jackie Baillie, deputy leader of Scottish Labour, that she risked losing political support unless the quality of the evidence she relied on improved. They said Swinney had also wrongly promised new data would be published on Wednesday to show how many patients were admitted because they had Covid, rather than for other medical reasons. Public Health Scotland said it hoped the figures would be released on Friday. English data suggests a third of Covid-positive patients were hospitalised with other medical complaints. “Transparency has ebbed away,” Cole-Hamilton said.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/scotland-cuts-covid-self-isolation-period-from-10-to-seven-days;3
190;190;5433;5433;Reduced timetables to come in on all of Great Britain’s rail network;2022-01-05T14:19:39Z;['Gwyn Topham'];['Rail industry', 'Business', 'Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'Rail transport', 'UK news', 'Scotland', 'Wales', 'England', 'Transport', 'RMT', 'Trade unions'];"Reduced timetables are to be brought in across Great Britain’s entire railway network by the middle of this month to deal with Covid staff shortages and to match falling passenger numbers. Train operators said passengers should check before they travel, with more companies due to introduce temporary timetables after moves from ScotRail, LNER and others in December. The industry body the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) said the reduced schedules would be introduced by 16 January for every operator to make services more resilient and reliable for passengers.
The RDG said the changes would also offer better value for taxpayers in the face of declining usage and fare revenue during the pandemic. It did not give a date for when normal service would resume. However, unions warned that the current crisis around the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant should not be used as cover for long-term cuts, while passenger representatives called for first and last services to be maintained throughout. High levels of staff absence during the latest wave of Covid infections led a number of operators to cancel services in the run-up to Christmas, starting with ScotRail, which was particularly affected because of Scotland’s rules on self-isolation for contacts as well as infected people. ScotRail brought in a temporary reduced weekday timetable this week, with 150 fewer services a day. CrossCountry has cut about 50 trains a day, while Southern will not run trains to its normal London terminus, Victoria, for the rest of the week. Transport for Wales and Greater Anglia have switched to amended timetables, while TransPennine Express, South Western, Northern and others are warning of short-notice service changes. The RDG’s director of people, operations and railway strategy, Susie Homan, said: “The temporary timetables that rail companies are putting in place, with government support, will help ensure more reliable services with fewer short-notice cancellations so that we can continue to get people and goods to where they need to be. “The government has supported the railway with over £15bn since the start of the pandemic, and it makes sense to better match the number of trains that are running with the number of people travelling, so that the industry gets the most out of every taxpayer pound and doesn’t take more than its fair share of public money.” Official figures show passenger numbers had fallen back to just over 50% of pre-pandemic levels before Christmas. However, the TSSA union demanded guarantees that the cuts would only last for the duration of the Omicron wave, with the instruction to work from home where possible making passenger numbers fall rapidly. The general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said: “We really fear that the Tory government is using temporary timetables as cover to reduce services so they can then implement cuts of £2bn on our railways.” He said the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, should “give passengers copper-bottomed guarantees that rail services will return back to their pre pandemic level as soon as we have any kind of return to normality”, adding: “Failure to do so would be a clear signal of what many fear are this government’s real intentions – cutting train services.”
The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: “No one should underestimate the impact that Covid is having on transport staff and there is a logic to adjusting services accordingly. However, any attempt to use this crisis to cynically bulldoze through permanent cuts to services and staffing levels would meet the stiffest resistance from this trade union.” The passenger watchdog Transport Focus said that amending timetables was a pragmatic response if it would prevent chaotic last-minute cancellations. However, Anthony Smith, the chief executive, added: “Services must still meet the needs of those who have to travel, especially key sector workers. “Operators must protect first and last services, provide enough space to keep passengers at a safe distance from each other, and flexibility so that tickets can be used on alternative routes or times.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/reduced-timetables-rail-network-great-britain;2

192;192;5435;5435;A maternal truth: some women don’t love their children as society thinks they should | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett;2022-01-05T14:09:34Z;['Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett'];['Parents and parenting', 'Maggie Gyllenhaal', 'Elena Ferrante', 'The Lost Daughter', 'Books', 'Film', 'Children', 'Women', 'Family', 'Society'];"There’s a moment in The Lost Daughter, Maggie Gyllenhaal’s adaptation of the Elena Ferrante novel which stars Olivia Colman, where I gasped out loud and swore at the character. Colman’s Leda, a professor holidaying in Greece alone, is conversing awkwardly with a pregnant stranger. “Children are a crushing responsibility,” she says, by way of a conversational coda. The bluntness of Colman’s delivery meant that I was laughing as I gasped, but still: everyone knows it to be on some level true, but you don’t go around saying such things to pregnant women. Or at least, you shouldn’t.
The Netflix film is a fairly faithful adaptation of the 2006 novel; it holds the same capacity to shock while bringing out new feelings and elucidations. The moment in the film where one of Leda’s daughters cuts her finger and repeatedly begs her mother – a younger Leda, played by Jessie Buckley – to kiss it better, is far more emotionally affecting than when described in the slim, interior novel. “Poor creatures who came out of my belly,” Leda narrates in the book, and as a cinematic audience at times we are inclined to agree with her. Because what sort of mother abandons her children, as Leda does? Is maternal ambivalence still a taboo? Some insist that it is, though a woman failing to love her children as society deems she should is hardly a new story, either in literature or reality. Maternal cruelty is still shocking, whether it comes in the form of a performance of Medea or another heartbreaking headline case of child murder or neglect. For some, even having mixed feelings about motherhood warrants punishment. Rachel Cusk’s 2015 adaptation of Medea at the Almeida theatre featured a chorus of “conforming yummy mummies”; Cusk herself was castigated by such a chorus for A Life’s Work, her 2001 book which committed the crime of being honest about how exhausting and miserable it was to have a baby who cried unceasingly (hardly a controversial revelation, or at least not by today’s standards). “Again and again people judged the book not as readers but as mothers,” Cusk later wrote. In recent years there has been a proliferation of awareness-raising about maternal ambivalence, especially postnatal depression. Courageous women have spoken out and written about it, defying what Cusk describes as the tendency of the communal to prevail over the individual when it comes to motherhood. These women are brave because the voices that contradict a powerful cultural myth are so often castigated. Eventually these voices formed their own chorus, and the taboo itself is weakening, or at least it seems that way to me. Yet these works maintain an emotional force, perhaps because now, with our greater understanding, we know just how close so many mothers have come to being driven mad by it. Perhaps, we worry, our own mothers were. It is not a comfortable feeling, and The Lost Daughter is not a comfortable film. Leda is not held up for judgment by us, though at times the audience may of course judge her. In a recent adaptation of Nancy Mitford’s The Pursuit of Love, maternal abandonment is played for laughs in the form of the character of “The Bolter”, Fanny’s mother, who flees any form of commitment. It is tonally entirely different to The Lost Daughter, but again, simple judgment is the least interesting reaction one can have. It feels less scandalous, these days, to admit that women can have other interests besides childrearing, and that finding a way to reconcile making art, in particular, with the division of domestic labour is a worthy source of creative exploration. Works such as Lara Feigel’s Free Woman, which explores Doris Lessing’s maternal ambivalence (she abandoned two of her children) as well as her own, have added to this conversation, as have novels by Sheila Heti, Jenny Offill, and Avni Doshi, among others. Yet the death of Joan Didion saw a resurgence of the Caitlin Flanagan article in which she puts Didion’s childcare arrangements under the microscope. “Where was Quintana when Didion was living at the Faculty Club, or finishing her novels at her parents’ house, or bunking down in the Haight”, Flanagan asks. “Not with her mother.” Those four words drip with judgment. “The children stared at me,” Leda narrates towards the end of the novel The Lost Daughter. “I felt their gazes longing to tame me, but more brilliant was the brightness of life outside them, new colours, new bodies, new intelligence, a language to possess finally as if it were my true language, and nothing, nothing that seemed to me reconcilable with that domestic space from which they stared at me in expectation.” Ferrante remains the empress of maternal ambivalence. It comes down to language. In The Days of Abandonment, the narrator Olga describes the experience of breastfeeding: “I was like a lump of food that my children chewed without stopping, a cud made of a living material that continually amalgamated and softened its living substance to allow two greedy bloodsuckers to nourish themselves.” To read such words still feel like a forceful, visceral refutation, a scream in the face of the prevailing narrative. Many women will no doubt read those lines and reflect, “that isn’t how it was for me.” But I hope that we are moving away from a place where one woman’s experience is taken to automatically undermine another’s. Most women will not abandon their children as Leda does, but many of us know that a more complex rendering of motherhood on screen and on the page can only be a good thing for us all. After all, it is when feelings are deemed unutterable that they become suffocating.

193;193;5436;5436;Broad’s Ashes dismissal of Warner reminds fans what might have been | Geoff Lemon;2022-01-05T14:08:05Z;['Geoff Lemon'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'The Ashes', 'England cricket team', 'Australia cricket team', 'Australia sport', 'Australia news', 'Cricket', 'Sport'];"When Stuart Broad took David Warner’s edge on the first day of the Sydney Test, into the slip cordon to be safely clasped, it felt like something clicked into place. This was the scent of a familiar dish, or YouTubing a favourite scene from a movie. The reassurance of the familiar, and the rightness of something that should be just so. At the same time, there was the unmistakable sense that thousands of people across the world were shouting at their television sets that they had told you so, or told someone so, and why had nobody listened?
Warner’s 2019 Ashes immolation at the torch of Broad is the stuff of forever. Ten innings, 95 runs, a single-figure series average. Among cricket lovers, it lives on with the potency and permanence of a race memory. Broad was the tormentor for seven dismissals of the 10, coming around the wicket to the left-hander, angling the ball in, using his mastery of English conditions to make it seam and swing from a length so full as to be always threatening. Sometimes it came in to hit pads or stumps, sometimes away to take the outside edge, even drawing nicks when an increasingly flummoxed Warner tried to leave the ball. In the current series, then, when Broad was left out in Brisbane and in Melbourne, there was widespread bewilderment. Why would England forgo the weapon that could wipe out Australia’s prolific opener? Perhaps because it was a different year in a different country. The bowler had twice before played series against Warner in Australia. Across all five Tests in 2017-18, Broad didn’t dismiss him once, while Warner repeatedly set the tone and averaged 63. In 2013-14, Broad got him four times, but only after the opener had made enough runs to average 58. Even previous series in England had not gone Broad’s way: no wicket in 10 attempts in 2015, where Warner made five half‑centuries and averaged 46; one dismissal in six innings against the junior version in 2013. In emphasising the dominance of 2019 on the one hand, you also have to concede that in all their other contests Warner has played 15 Tests for six Broad dismissals, three centuries, 12 half-centuries, and an average of nearly 49. But it could have been different at the Gabba, right? Where Broad got him out twice in 2013? Yes, got him out for 49 and 124. Admittedly the 2021 Gabba had greenness and juice in the surface, and that duel could have been compelling. The question about whether there was a psychological hangover from 2019 would have been tested. Audiences were denied the intrigue of that contest, and that is a shame in itself.
It doesn’t mean the whole series would have been different. Broad bowled to Warner the next week instead, in Adelaide. Warner made 95. Even if Broad had been picked in Brisbane, England would presumably have stuck to the plan of batting first. Which brings us back to the problem that England’s batting is currently nowhere near the standard to function in international cricket. Broad’s prowess with the stick would not have improved upon Brisbane’s first-day debacle. Among all of the arguments that have played out before and during each Test about the choice of bowlers, England have had a batting collapse in every innings: 10 for 147, eight for 74, eight for 86, nine for 144, eight for 124, and 10 for 68. Stuart Broad can’t change that. Stuart Broad can’t defend that. Wasim Akram, Malcolm Marshall, and Robocop fused with a bowling machine can’t defend that. Even bowling magic cannot transform batting coal into gold.
So when one old combatant dismissed the other on the first day at the SCG, there was an echo of what might have been had they gone head-to-head to start the series. There was also an echo of what might have been had the work of Broad and company been given support by the rest of their team. That edge into the slip cordon could be the starting point of a mighty bowling surge on the second day, and it still won’t matter a jot of ink in the scorebook unless England can find some runs to go with it. Broad bowling to Warner in Brisbane was never going to change everything. It can’t change anything unless something else changes first.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/05/broad-warner-ashes-fans-england-australia;4
194;194;5437;5437;Tux and Fanny review – a surreal lo-fi treasure of a game;2022-01-05T14:04:28Z;['Sarah Maria Griffin'];['Games', 'Culture', 'Nintendo', 'PC', 'Adventure games', 'Hobbies', 'Life and style'];"Like many great adventures, Tux and Fanny begins on a quiet afternoon. Our two oddly named protagonists decide that they would like to play a game of football, but disaster strikes: the ball is flat. Our quest is simple – find a way to reinflate the football. Can we find a pump? This first challenge is the route towards hundreds of other tiny mysteries in the labyrinthine world of Tux and Fanny’s house and surrounding gardens, each stranger and more delightful than the last. There is a tree growing up through the floor. The antenna on the roof is broken. There is a door in the wall where there shouldn’t be and strange figures are coming through. All is absolutely not what it seems. To categorise this as a point-and-click adventure, or an exploration game, or a puzzle game feels wrong, though it incorporates elements of all three genres while subverting them at every turn. The player wanders around as Tux, Fanny, the cat or the flea that lives on the cat’s back, and even the rewards for your problem-solving have a dreamlike feel to them. Some puzzles contain whole worlds of their own: an entire readable copy of Moby-Dick is hidden on the shelf, as are many tiny comics and zines that are a joy to browse through. There is a plethora of micro-games, found on floppy disks around the house and garden, which you can play on the desktop computer in the living room. These micro-games have silly names such as Skull Legs and Puzzle Tractor, but they are purposeful and even occasionally poetic in their execution.
The visual style is noteworthy – it changes often, depending on which of the many queries we as players are trying to solve. Sometimes it is a simple, blocky pixelated world. Sometimes it is animated in watercolour, sometimes computer-generated, sometimes it is stop-motion, sometimes it is all of those things at once. It is never the same for long. Tux and Fanny began as a long series of tiny films by director and writer Albert Birney. It feels very personal, which tempers the surrealism and grounds what is a weird experience. The stranger parts of the game are sometimes the most poignant: the narrative journey of the flea on the cat’s back is quite moving, for example, which caught me off guard. While we might find the pump for the football early enough in the long and surprising afternoon we are playing through, we find many other incredible things. We categorise birds, paint and sell pictures on the internet, float down a river on a tyre and shatter the fabric of reality and paste it back together. Tux and Fanny is unique and gorgeous: a strange treasure. • Tux and Fanny is out now; £8.";https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/05/tux-and-fanny-review-a-surreal-lo-fi-treasure-of-a-game;5
195;195;5438;5438;This is the action Britain must take to limit the damage of Omicron | William Hanage;2022-01-05T14:00:35Z;['William Hanage'];['Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'Infectious diseases', 'UK news', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Health', 'World news'];To call Omicron’s rise in the UK “precipitate” is to violently understate matters. Daily case counts have broken the record set just the day before over and over again. Yesterday they hit over 218,000. Amid such an astonishing surge of infection, consequences are unavoidable. Despite consistent evidence suggesting that Omicron causes somewhat less severe illness, especially in vaccinated and boosted people, numbers like this wreak their own havoc. Even if Omicron were half as virulent as Delta, but infected four times as many people, twice as fast, that’s still a wrecking ball aimed at a teetering healthcare system. The NHS is already seeing staff shortages from illness and quarantine, and weighing the possibility of reducing or cancelling services. Businesses are similarly struggling. And customers seeking to avoid infection are voting with their feet. Boxing day sales traffic in London was down 67% from pre-pandemic levels in some areas, showing that you don’t need a lockdown to have an economic impact. The virus will do it for you. Amid the inquests into how the UK came to be caught flat-footed yet again in the face of a new variant, there’s the pressing question about what to do right now. The single most important thing at the moment is boosters. And at least a first dose for anyone who inexplicably is yet to receive one. Protection from severe infection among those who have been boosted appears very good, and we think it kicks in quickly. We are in a race with Omicron here, and anything that slows down the virus helps. Decreasing the overall rate of new cases will mean more people get boosted before they are infected. And if fewer people are infected there will also be more people available to deliver the shots and do other vital work. But while vaccines are the most important part of the strategy to blunt Omicron’s impact, they are not enough by themselves. We still need to support isolation for those infected, quarantine for those exposed, rapid tests to identify cases, and promote masking in public places. All of these need urgent support from the government. Frankly, it’s a travesty that amid all the events of the last two years there’s isn’t yet mandatory sick pay, and generous support for anyone who needs to isolate after testing positive for Covid. The shortening of isolation requirements to 7 days following a positive test – along with two negative antigen tests – might not be perfect, but it is defensible if we are seeking to maintain a workforce and avoid a shutdown of society by default, and to maintain essential services. Early evidence suggests that for many Omicron breakthrough cases, the period of infectiousness is shorter. So even if a person is still shedding detectable virus, they may be a low infection risk to others. Indeed, rapid antigen tests are widely believed to be a guide, if an imperfect one, to whether a person is currently infectious – even if they don’t catch every Covid case. So making them widely available will also help avoid further infection from any people shedding virus for a longer period. These tests are useful, but likely to be in short supply – as seen over the Christmas period. If that happens, we must consider when they are most effective. Infections in young people are less likely to be serious than those in older people. So rapid tests are best used to avoid introducing the virus to vulnerable older networks. Use one before seeing older relatives – and just before. The rate with which viral load – and thus infectivity – can increase with Omicron is impressive. And the longer the period since your last negative test, the less likely you are still negative. On top of that, everyone should be issued with a good quality mask and instructions on how to use it when indoors in public. There is no reason the government could not do this, but masks have become a flashpoint in the culture wars. The politicisation of mask use makes about as much sense as politicising gravity. Concerns from some infectious disease professionals about improper mask use are also misplaced. A bunch of people using unfitted N95s and not trained in their use, will still transmit far less to each other than a group using cloth masks or worse, nothing at all. Any prescriptions for how to slow Omicron will be met, I am sure, with fury from those determined to pretend either that the virus does not exist or that its consequences are minor. I appeal to those people to talk to the dedicated healthcare staff who have worked to save the lives of those suffering from Covid throughout the pandemic. Every booster that reaches a person before Omicron does, helps them. All the ferment and fury about the damage of lockdowns, usually from profoundly uninformed sources, many of whom are not acting in good faith, has always missed an essential point. Epidemiologists like myself have always been about reducing harm. Like risk, we cannot eliminate harm entirely, but we can takes steps to avoid the very worst consequences. These measures should accomplish that. Data from South Africa shows that as rapidly as Omicron hits, it starts to decline shortly thereafter. And so at least we think the surge will be short, and before the spring it will be largely in the rearview mirror. It won’t be pretty, but it will be quick.

196;196;5439;5439;Jon Needham: the man who went to hell and back as a child – and now fights for all rape victims;2022-01-05T14:00:35Z;['Alexandra Topping'];['UK criminal justice', 'Society', 'Rape and sexual assault', 'Police', 'Crime', 'Law', 'UK news'];"Jon Needham looks like a copper. Tall, broad and imposing, he works in a lifetime offender management unit, where he deals with serious and organised criminals. So when he speaks, his gentleness comes as a surprise. “I joined the police because I was passionate about helping people,” he says. “It sounds like a cliche to say you want to make a real difference, but I genuinely mean it.” Needham gets paid for working with “nominals” – people who are on the police database (“That’s what the police call them, I call them people,” he says). But he is also transforming how his colleagues deal with victims of rape and sexual assault. It took him until he was 45 to tell the story of the abuse he suffered as a child in foster care. In 2019, he detailed to a group of 70 officers from his own force, the City of London, how he was treated by the criminal justice system after he went to court. “I wanted police officers to see what it’s like from the voice of the survivor. After what I’ve lived through, I thought, well, if I can use that to help people in a positive way, that’d be great.” The number of people being convicted for rape is at a record low – just 1.6% of the 52,210 rapes recorded by police in England and Wales in 2020 resulted in a charge or a summons – and confidence in the criminal justice system is at rock bottom, so the work has never been more urgent.
In June, a government report into the staggering decline in rape prosecutions, which have plummeted by 70% since 2016-17, prompted ministers to apologise unreservedly to rape survivors, saying they were “deeply ashamed” that thousands of survivors had been failed on the government’s watch. New plans promised to switch the focus of police investigations away from the credibility of victims, who have been subject to “digital strip searches”. These include having mobile phones taken away and text messages unrelated to a case being used against them in court – as well as notes from counselling and therapy being used to undermine cases. Instead, the focus will be on the perpetrator, the report claimed. The report is progress, Needham says, but he is not going to wait for the system to transform itself. The stories of survivors, like him, have to be part of the solution. Needham was seven when he was taken into care, after his father was imprisoned for a crime he is still not able to talk about. “It was horrendous,” he says. “It just destroyed our family. My first memory is of a knock on the door and two coppers being there. They came in, the next minute my dad was in handcuffs, and then he was gone for years. The victims of crime are not just people who have been abused or robbed or hurt, it’s their families, and the families of the criminal – innocent family members who have to go through the torture of going to prison to visit them.” His mother, with five children and no money, became seriously mentally ill, and so the children were removed and put into care. His foster carers were quite elderly but seemed nice people. “Not my cup of tea, but you know, they are not your family so it’s not a pleasant experience,” he remembers. His bedroom was small, with a sash window. But there was another bedroom at the front of the house, and it was here that Needham says a much older boy raped him, almost every week, for about a year. Talking about the abuse as an adult, Needham is calm and matter-of-fact. Back then, he had no one to tell, he didn’t think he would be believed, and the older boy made terrifying threats about what would happen to him if he told anyone. The abuse went on for a year, until his father came out of prison and Needham went to live with him. “We had mattresses, a toaster, a kettle and a washing machine and that’s all we had for about a year, but for me, it was great. I thought ‘this is better than foster care’ – it was like an adventure: we had a back garden.” He taught himself to play the guitar and went to music school, but dropped out and played in bands. Through his 20s, he worked in a range of jobs, from property maintenance to retail, never sticking to one thing. “I was in the wilderness for many years,” he says. “I didn’t think I could do anything or was worth anything.” When a friend suggested he would make a good police officer, he initially thought it was impossible – he was dyslexic and had no qualifications. But after applying, and failing several times, he made it into the force in 2009. “It felt amazing, almost like validation, even though I knew the training would be tough,” he says. “But I suffered a lot from impostor syndrome, and even now I look over my shoulder and wonder if it’s real.” He recently got a commander of commendation award for dealing with serious prolific offenders, having been given a commissioner’s commendation award in 2018 for professionalism and bravery in dealing with a violent offender. “It does make me feel like I finally belong and deserve to be here. I’m getting there,” he says. Needham didn’t disclose what had happened to him as a child when he joined the force – he had still told no one – but, after joining the police, the feeling that he had a responsibility to report his abuser grew. “I felt guilty about not reporting it for years,” he says. “I thought: ‘This guy must have gone on to do it again.’” So he picked up the phone.
Two officers came to his house. “They did a video statement – it was the first time I’d ever fully recounted the story – and they forgot to press record. It’s not a criticism of the officers, but I mention it now in my talk to officers – make sure you know the equipment and make sure you know it’s working.” He adds that, for survivors, constantly having to relive their trauma just compounds the damage. “When you do decide to come forward, you sort of mentally prepare yourself, there is an adrenaline high. If you get off that rollercoaster and then have to get back on, it will bring back memories and you can suffer from PTSD.” Needham was called several times by the investigating officer in the case, asking if he was sure he wanted to go to trial. “It felt like he was trying to talk me out of it,” he says. “I’m sure that wasn’t the case, but that’s what it felt like. So I said, ‘Yeah, I’m determined.’ Why would I report it if I’m not going to go through with it?” When his day in court arrived, Needham saw his attacker again for the first time since he left foster care. He declined to use a screen or give evidence by video link. “I said to the officer: ‘I want to look the guy in the eye. Whatever happens, I’m going to sit there and I’m going to look at him and tell the jury what he’s done to me.’” Needham had worked in the police for years by this time, and was accustomed to tough questioning, but found the defence barrister particularly confrontational. “I felt like I was on trial,” he says. “They’re just constantly trying to trip you up on every single thing. He asked me about care homes in the area and whether I’d visited any of them, trying to deliberately confuse me. The barrister was very snotty, very intimidating. I remember standing there, shaking; I was petrified.
“I think, emotionally, I was not ready for it, because you’re never ready for these things. By the end, I felt traumatised.” After a week-long trial, the jury was released and took two days to come back: the result was hung. Six months later, he was back in court again. He started getting panic attacks. “I sort of pretended I didn’t have all that, you know, because I’m in the police service, I wanted to be tough.” But when giving evidence, he broke down. “I cried like a baby, I know it sounds … the judge paused it for a little while, and then went back in and finished my evidence. Afterwards, I thought, I’ve left everything I’ve got in that courtroom, and I’ve done everything I can, psychologically, emotionally, physically. And if I don’t get a result then the system’s not working.” The case went to a hung jury a second time. The man he said had attacked him walked free. “I’d been walking up and down my living room for days and they couldn’t come to a decision. It was a nightmare, even now it makes my skin crawl to think about it.” Needham’s mental health collapsed. “I went home and stayed in my bedroom for three months. Pretty much just shaking, jumping at noises, you know […] I wouldn’t go out, I didn’t eat, I was sleeping all day and up all night. I was really angry for about six months, asking what had gone wrong, what I could have done to convince them. I felt disbelieved, like I was a criminal – like every part of my life had been under the microscope. I was mortified.” He was diagnosed with PTSD, signed off work for three months, and started the long process of getting well. “Having counselling was the best thing I ever did: I just talked and talked to this poor lady. She was an amazing, amazing person.” Since that final trial, Needham has rebuilt his life. He met his German wife, an engineer, in 2014, at a blues club where he was playing, and she helped to make him laugh again. “She’s incredibly supportive of the work I do and appreciates me being open about my past,” he says. “I said to her when we met that I’m looking forward, not back. You can’t drive a car if you’re looking in your rear-view mirror.” He also has a positive relationship with his daughter from a previous relationship. In addition, he mentored 13 to 15 year olds with the Prince’s Trust. “They started by calling me ‘the Feds’,” he says. “By the end of the term, I had them dressing up in police forensic kits and uniforms, completing mock crime scene inquiries, asking me about how to join up, and calling me Officer Needham or Sir.”
At the end of July he spent 24 hours locked in a cell to raise money for the Survivors Trust. With the charity’s support, he is now developing a network of trained victim survivor ambassadors, available to visit all 43 police forces in England and Wales, to give survivors a voice and provide vital insight to officers working on sexual abuse cases. “I didn’t get closure at the trial but I’m glad I did it,” he says. “I felt the justice system had no empathy. It’s not about people. To me, it felt more about just getting through the caseload they had. I was just another case number on their paper. And that’s what I’m trying to change – hopefully, the work I do now will have more impact than one conviction. “I’ve been through the system, I’ve been through hell and back. I’ve hidden in my bedroom for three months, I’ve had to be dragged out. But I can tell my story – about how I’ve got from that to where I am today”. He says the recent government rape review means “we are getting support from the senior level. It’s been a battle against the wind, but we have momentum now.” He pauses for breath, and lets out a short laugh. “I’m so passionate about it, I’m going to keep on going until we get the system we need,” he says. “Now I’ve started talking, no one is ever going to shut me up.”";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/jon-needham-child-rape-victims-abuse-court-police-officer-survivors;6
197;197;5440;5440;‘I want to show France who we are’: the slum influencer with his sights on parliament;2022-01-05T14:00:35Z;['Phil Hoad'];['Social media', 'France', 'Cities', 'Digital media', 'Europe', 'Media', 'World news'];"Influence is not a word readily associated with St Jacques, the Gypsy quarter of the city of Perpignan. Yet, on a recent chilly night shortly before 8pm, the ineffable hand of influence is behind an outbreak of street theatre on the plane tree-lined oblong of Place Cassanyes. People are arriving in droves. By 7.50pm, there must be more than 200, mostly young men, in rowdy clusters. Smoking, yelling, stretching, one group doing can-can legs: it’s like Fast & Furious without the automobiles. One man in a red Adidas tracksuit is trying to line everyone up across the square’s breadth. A beacon in a sea of dark casual-wear, the influencer known as NasDas – St Jacques born and bred – is responsible for this circus. The previous night, NasDas posted to his 1.2 million followers a picture of one of his posse holding up a crinkled €500 bill, followed by footage of a previous Place Cassanyes footrace. Tonight is a rerun, only with a bigger prize. But this time the turnout is far bigger, too. Streaming live on Snapchat, he’s antsy: “On my mother’s life, I didn’t expect this kind of crowd – from Avignon, from Marseille, from everywhere.” NasDas – real name Nasser Sari – has achieved the feat of becoming France’s No 1 Snapchat influencer from one of the country’s poorest neighbourhoods. Perpignan is the last French Mediterranean city 20 miles (32km) north of the Spanish border; rising up a hill at the back of its town centre is St Jacques, a tightly packed, roughneck enclave on a medieval street grid where 60% of households live in poverty. Three-quarters of a population numbering somewhere 3,000 and 7,000 are Catalan Gypsies; the remainder, coexisting sometimes tensely with their neighbours, are Arab – including the 25-year-old NasDas, whose parents emigrated from Algeria. When outsiders go to St Jacques, they often see only the omnipresent rubbish. But NasDas saw life, beauty and humour in his daily surroundings. A few years ago, he began shooting the street shenanigans and characters around him: “I didn’t want to be No 1, or even to be a Snapchatter or an influencer. I’d just get my phone out at the cafe: ‘Who’s going to pay? You? You never pay!’ And I realised that people liked watching my daily life.” He began adding semi-dramatised skits, like one spoofing banlieue arrivisme, in which his posse abscond to Barcelona with his credit card and hit the luxury boutiques – while he receives a stream of obscene receipts on his smartphone back home. By mid-2020, his sly observations and charm had won him tens of thousands of followers. Caught in a smartphone window, NasDas has a genial, almost Fozzie Bear-ish charisma riffing with his catchphrase: “La chiennété!” (which translates as something like “Doglife”). Strangely, among France’s many influencers, hardly any are chronicling its quartiers populaires (working-class neighbourhoods) like this. “You go on Snapchat, and it’s people in thongs, next to luxury buildings and nice cars – all the same things,” says NasDas’s manager, a 32-year-old who appears in the videos anonymously as the “masked man”.
There are rappers, dancers, humorists and makeup artists from those places – but few instances of people simply documenting daily life. Nordine Idri, a 17-year-old from Marseille who recounted his former life as a drug-network lookout on YouTube, is another isolated example. Cinema about the cités (estates) – from La Haine to Intouchables to Girlhood – has tended to be steered by outsiders (2019’s Les Misérables was a rare high-profile example told by the residents themselves). But it seems surprising that social media, where all the technology needed fits into your pocket, hasn’t produced more chroniclers of the quartiers. Maybe the impulse in those impoverished places is more towards the aspirational kind of influencing. NasDas likes flashing the cash, too. But the extraordinary thing is that he seems to give most of it away – he forks out banknotes on his feed almost every day. By summer this year, he was Snapchat’s top influencer in France (or so he claims – Snapchat won’t confirm with exact figures) and had successfully monetised his operation with commercial contracts and product placements: for dentists, online CV apps, iced tea, luxury cars, all sorts. He estimates that he gives away about 80% of what he earns – most of it privately, he says. Developing St Jacques is his main priority; with handouts, through education (he encourages truant kids to go to school and organises street clean-ups for his Snap feed) and by promoting local businesses. The day before the race, this social-media Robin Hood sits sipping a café noisette at a table on Place Cassanyes. He is six feet tall, easygoing in the flesh compared with his antic Snapchat persona, but authoritative too. He says people coming from all over France for selfies with him proves that he has changed St Jacques’ image. As we talk, two brothers from Grenoble step up for a moment with their hero. But NasDas acknowledges that his neighbourhood won’t change overnight: “There’s a reality you shouldn’t hide. The level of violence is still quite high, unfortunately. In my eyes it’s too high, because I can’t stand violence.” In August a 23-year-old man was shot and killed outside a takeaway only metres away. On NasDas’s finger is a gold lion signet ring. Maybe it stands for his mother, whom he describes as a “lion”. She is where he gets his sense of social responsibility from; she raised him and his four siblings solo after his father died when he was 10. They lived two floors above the abandoned police station on the corner of Place Cassanyes that became St Jacques’ key drug-dealing point. Some of his peers were earning €300 a day when he was 16, but she battled to keep him out of the trade. Now, with his newfound fame, he’s taking St Jacques under his wing. *** At Perpignan’s funfair, the dusk sky has faded to dark ochre as the Day-Glo lights of the rides obscure the stars. Team NasDas is trying to do a “low-profile” trip, so he can chaperone his young niece and nephew. At least, as low-profile as you can be when you and your right-hand man, Samos, are dressed in matching white tracksuits. At the entrance, people are already peeking and whispering: “Il y a NasDas” (his niece is helpfully wearing a “NasDas la Chiennété” T-shirt). Soon they’re sidling up for a non-stop stream of photos. Next to the waltzers, we get bogged down by fans and well-wishers for nearly 20 minutes. “He’s so funny,” gush a couple of twentysomething local women. “He doesn’t give a damn.” During hundreds of interactions, NasDas is staunchly friendly – but there is a weary lag in his eyes. He admits he has struggled with his breakneck rise to fame, and the constant requests for money and help: “There was a point I thought I was going mad. I just wanted to go and drink a coffee like everyone else, and I couldn’t.” When he began having anxiety attacks, his managers took him out to the countryside to get things in perspective. A couple of sessions with a therapist later, he got back on the horse.
Milling around him at the funfair is most of Team NasDas: Samos, the rail-thin, broken-toothed pal who often serves as his stooge in the videos; Tounsi, a burly, gruff twentysomething who is the only one NasDas was close to prior to fame; 4BDV, an urchin-like 17-year-old who looks 12 and whom NasDas took into his house after he showed up in St Jacques after crossing the Mediterranean from Algeria by boat (the influencer is applying to be his legal guardian); only Billy DZ – ill, apparently – isn’t present. Now there is an entire infrastructure supporting the team: a total of 40 people – including two Paris influencer agencies – looking after technical support, event bookings, commercial opportunities and strategy. And NasDas is sizing up the world beyond social media; he will soon appear on TV talkshows, Netflix has contacted him about a possible documentary, and he plans to perform a one-man show at Paris’s 3,000-seater Olympia venue next year. Even those things could be just the beginning. NasDas likes to use his feed to flex his social conscience, beyond handouts for the residents. He has often criticised Perpignan town hall’s management of St Jacques; dysfunctional and corrupt under previous administrations, but now with an extra vindictive edge under Louis Aliot, the only far-right Rassemblement National mayor of a major French city. The influencer recently turned his smartphone on the case of an eight-year-old taken into police custody (along with 4BDV) after being spotted on CCTV with a plastic pellet gun. Parking charges imposed in September on Place Cassanyes – which many residents can’t afford are another of NasDas’s targets. Whether it’s judicial or economic, he sees the intended effect in straightforward terms: “It’s repression.”
Now that NasDas has become a public figure, the town hall has begun taking notice of him, he says. “I think they’re even more offended because I’m not asking for their help. It disturbs them: a young Maghrebin who doesn’t ask for help and succeeds in sorting out the neighbourhood.” (The town hall did not respond to requests for comment.) But he could have the perfect reply. He plans to stand for the national assembly in June elections to attempt to become one of four MPs for Pyrenées-Orientales, the département of which Perpignan is capital. “I want to shatter the cliches,” he says. “I’m young, of colour, someone who dares. I want to annoy people a bit. To show France who we are.” Pyrenées-Orientales has about 350,000 registered voters; if only a portion of NasDas’s followers vote for him, he could be Snapchatting from parliament this time next year. The pressures on NasDas aren’t just from the outside. St Jacques has a long history of unhealthy dependency on community figureheads with privileged access to power. Going back to the 1970s, there have been claims that patriarchs among some Gypsy families in St Jacques traded the community vote for political favours. Cash sums and white goods were allegedly distributed after elections; latterly jobs and influence over the long-mooted renovation of this tumbledown district. Now NasDas, through the power conferred by social media, is the one with influence – in every sense. There can be no doubting his deep solicitude for St Jacques, but you wonder whether he can withstand the pressures he will probably face from inside his neighbourhood. Just before the race, as we’re talking, he is collared by a community “big brother”, who harangues him in Arabic. Ten minutes later, he turns up again, demanding that NasDas speak to someone on the phone. What was that about? Apparently, the man is one of several intermediaries, including the man on the phone and someone else in prison, who are facilitating a product placement on Snapchat for a business in Paris. He was trying to get NasDas to lower his fee to €5,000, so he can take a larger, €3,000 cut of the original price. The influencer insists it is just an isolated case; that he experiences virtually no open jealousy, and 99.99% of St Jacques is behind him. But you suspect that this coveting of the money and publicity NasDas is generating will increase as his star rises. In any case, he is irate: “It’s the people from here who you drag you down. People in prison who drag you down.”
Half an hour later, on the racetrack of Place Cassanyes, another kind of people management is required. At 8.05pm, the square is heaving. “Disperse!” insists NasDas – and the throng loiters on all four sides, trying to look as inconspicuous as 300 people gathered for the same reason can. Five minutes later, NasDas has called off the race. Three policeman on bikes are mingling among them; Tounsi reckons it’s a warning shot across the bows. With Aliot watching, there can’t be any slip-ups. The disappointed crowd starts filing away. Grinning incredulously – as if wondering how all this has happened – NasDas retreats to a cafe to stream his reactions. He’s going nowhere: “I was in St Jacques before social media, I’m here during social media, and I’ll be here afterwards too.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/i-want-to-show-france-who-we-are-the-slum-influencer-with-his-sights-on-parliament;5
198;198;5441;5441;High levels of toxic ‘forever chemicals’ found in anti-fogging sprays for glasses;2022-01-05T14:00:35Z;['Gloria Oladipo'];['US news', 'Coronavirus', 'Science', 'Pollution', 'World news', 'Environment', 'PFAS'];"Anti-fogging sprays and cloths often used to prevent condensation on eyeglasses from wearing a mask or on face shields may contain high levels of potentially toxic PFAS “forever chemicals”, according to a new study led by Duke University. Researchers tested four of the top-rated anti-fogging sprays as well as five top-rated anti-fogging cloths sold by Amazon. In all nine products, experts found fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and fluorotelomer ethoxylates (FTEOs), two types of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS have been dubbed as forever chemicals due to their longevity in the environment. “Our tests show the sprays contain up to 20.7 milligrams of PFAS per milliliter of solution, which is a pretty high concentration,” said study lead Nicholas Herkert, a postdoctoral researcher at Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment.
Exposure to some PFAs – perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) in particular – have been linked to cancer, thyroid disease, fertility complications and other health problems. Herkert noted that FTOHs and FTEOs have not been studied extensively, so scientists do not know what health risks they could pose, but research currently suggests that FTOHs inhaled or absorbed through the skin could break down in the body and become toxic, long-lasting PFAs. The FTEOs used in all four anti-fogging sprays were also analyzed in the new study and exhibited substantial cell-altering toxicity and conversion to fat cells during lab tests, said Herkert. “It’s disturbing to think that products people have been using on a daily basis to help keep themselves safe during the Covid pandemic may be exposing them to a different risk,” said Heather Stapleton, a distinguished professor of environmental chemistry and health at Duke. Stapleton initiated the study after reviewing the ingredients in a bottle of anti-fogging spray she bought for her 9-year-old daughter. Stapleton noted that the other eight products did not have their ingredients listed, making it virtually impossible to tell if they contained toxic chemicals until they were analyzed using equipment from her research laboratory. This study, conducted by Herkert and Stapleton with researchers from Duke University, Wayne State University, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, is only the second ever to focus on FTEOS. The researchers published their peer-reviewed study on 5 January in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Herkert and Stapleton said that more research would be needed to expand on initial findings, with larger studies involving tests on living organisms being the next step. Studies that include a larger sample size of sprays and cloths could also help identify other unknown chemicals being used in these products. “Because of Covid, more people than ever, including many medical professionals and other first-responders, are using these sprays and cloths to keep their glasses from fogging up when they wear masks or face shields,” said Stapleton. “They deserve to know what’s in the products they’re using.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/pfas-forever-chemicals-anti-fogging-spray-wipes;7
199;199;5442;5442;Man who killed brother during drunken row jailed for at least 21 years;2022-01-05T13:56:38Z;['Mark Brown'];['Crime', 'Sunderland', 'UK news'];"A man who killed his younger brother with a kitchen knife after a drunken row about the way the dog was spoken to has been told he must serve at least 21 years in jail. A court heard that William Campbell, 26, had been binge drinking vodka in the pub for more than five hours on the evening of 17 June last year. His brother Samuel, 24, had drunk at least a bottle of Jim Beam bourbon and was listening to music in the back garden of the family home in Silksworth, Sunderland. William arrived home and was told by his mother that Samuel was waiting up to share a drink with him. Jailing Campbell for life, Judge Paul Sloan QC, the recorder of Newcastle, said what had followed was a “totally insignificant” row. He added: “It would seem that you took exception to the way your brother had been talking to his dog.” The court heard he went to the kitchen, took a sharp, sheathed knife from a drawer, returned to the garden and stabbed his brother in the chest in the presence of their mother, who had earlier tried to act as peacemaker.
Defending, Nicholas Lumley QC read from a statement provided by the brothers’ father, Eddie Campbell, which described how the pair had grown up extremely close to each other. “There was sibling unrest, of course there was,” said Lumley. “But for the most part this was a loving, supportive relationship with the two of them sharing a room for so long without serious difficulty.” However, the judge said there was a history of violence which “went well beyond spats that can occur between brothers”. He also pointed to William’s initial claims that he had acted in self-defence, followed by testimony that the stabbing was accidental. A jury at Newcastle crown court last month found Campbell, a council worker of Stokesley, North Yorkshire, guilty of murder after a week-long trial. Afterwards DCI Jane Fairlamb, of Northumbria police, said: “This is a terribly sad case that has seen a family torn apart in the most devastating of circumstances.” On Wednesday, Samuel’s partner, Alice Gray, a teacher, read a statement describing how the murder had “utterly devastated my life and broken my heart beyond anything I knew possible”. She added: “I visit Sam’s grave every day and have done since he passed away. I just can’t sit at home in an empty house when he isn’t there with me.” Gray said she had been prescribed sleeping pills and antidepressants, which she had been told she may never come off. The judge said he had no doubt that Campbell, who has autism, bitterly regretted what had happened and wished to atone for it. But he said the minimum term Campbell should serve before a Parole Board could consider him for release was 21 years.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/sunderland-man-who-killed-brother-jailed;1
200;200;5443;5443;Girl dies and eight hurt after wind blows bouncy castle into air in Spain;2022-01-05T13:55:40Z;['Ashifa Kassam'];['Spain', 'Europe', 'Children', 'Society', 'World news'];An eight-year-old girl has died and eight children have been injured after wind gusts lifted a bouncy castle metres into the air at a fair in eastern Spain. Emergency services were called to the fairgrounds in Mislata, a municipality on the outskirts of Valencia, on Tuesday evening. Minutes earlier, horrified witnesses had watched as the fair’s inflatable structure became airborne, throwing several children on to the ground. “All of a sudden I saw it rise into the air,” one witness told reporters. “I saw the kids that were in the air, I think they fell onto another inflatable structure. There was a young girl on the floor, unconscious.” She and others rushed to help out. “Fairgoers, the families, passersby – we were all doing what we could to help.” Nine children were taken to hospital, two of them in a serious condition. Firefighters shared photos showing pieces of the deflated castle scattered across the fairground, adding that a search had been carried out to ensure that no children were trapped in the structure. On Wednesday Mislata officials said one of the children, an eight-year-old girl, had died of her injuries. A four-year-old remains in hospital. “A very sad day for Mislata,” the city’s mayor, Carlos Fernández Bielsa, tweeted. The city declared a period of official mourning until Friday and said all remaining Christmas festivities, including a Three Kings parade planned for Wednesday, would be cancelled. “We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the child who lost her life. She was only eight years old,” officials said. They said police were investigating to clarify the facts and determine the responsibilities, if any, of the company that set up the fair. The death comes weeks after six children died when a gust sent a bouncy castle 10 metres (32ft) into the air in Tasmania. The incident, which is under investigation, prompted calls for better regulation of safety standards on bouncy castles. “Things like this should never happen,” Prof Rebecca Ivers, the head of the school of public health at the University of New South Wales, said, adding it was well known that the structures were prone to being lifted by gusts of wind. In 2019, two children died when a tornado-like wind swept through a fair in China. In 2018, a British couple were convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence after the death of a girl on a bouncy castle in Norwich. In November, a court in Spain sentenced a couple to a year in prison after an inflatable structure at their restaurant was carried for metres by strong winds in 2017, killing a six-year-old child and injuring six others. The court found that the structure had not been fully anchored to the ground. “The tragic accident was a direct consequence of non-compliance with assembly, safety and supervisory measures,” it said.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/bouncy-castle-wind-blows-valencia-spain-girl-dies;3
201;201;5444;5444;Folk’s unsung heroines – the sisters who saved English music;2022-01-05T13:46:19Z;['N/A'];['Folk music', 'Music', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Theatre', 'England'];"My play began in a flash of inspiration, but it would take me 10 years to finish it. At one point I completely discarded it as a failed project, then Hampstead theatre’s Roxana Silbert inspired me to go back. Covid interfered and the production was delayed, making me fear it might never see the light of day; then BBC Radio 3 included my adaptation in their Drama on 3/Culture in Quarantine series. Now, finally, the play has a full production at Hampstead theatre. I have a history of burning manuscripts that don’t please me, but luckily this one had escaped the fire. I grew up in Somerset, first in Glastonbury, then in a small village on the edge of the Somerset Levels. Back in Glastonbury in 2009 I went to see an exhibition at the Rural Life Museum about Cecil Sharp and folk music. Sharp collected songs from 1903 until 1924, and founded what is now the English Folk Song and Dance Society. In the exhibition there was a photograph of John England, a gardener who had sung to Sharp what is purported to be the first song he ever collected, The Seeds of Love. There was another of a singer who had lived in my own village. Then I saw the images of two sisters from a village near mine, Louie Hooper and Lucy White, who between them sang over 100 songs to Sharp.
Folk-song collecting was a growing movement in the early years of the 20th century, driven by a desire to rescue these songs before they were lost to the tail end of the Industrial Revolution, when machines would work the land and the sewing would be moved into factories. Sharp published many of them, arranging them for piano and editing the lyrics so that they were suitable for a middle-class audience. He tidied rhymes and rhythms and then placed his name on them, copyrighting them. At the time this wasn’t seen as an egregious act. The two sisters gave Sharp over 100 songs, yet their names were nowhere, their stories untold. The images of the sisters kept coming back to me. I did some research and learned that they were the daughters of a well-known singer who would have sung these songs to her children, songs that they knew by heart. I started to imagine what it might feel like if your body contained that many songs, enough to sing for days without repetition. I write both drama and prose, and ideas are born inside their form: this was definitely a play, about the human voice, about live song. I found an incredible transcript of a 1940s interview with Louie Hooper, then in her 80s, where she talked about her love for music, how she listened to birds and rain, found musical patterns in their sounds, and how she sat by the older people in the village and “caught” their songs. She fascinated me. It is always the untold story, the silent voice that captures my imagination.
Meanwhile my research quickly revealed Sharp as opinionated and ferociously ambitious – Sharp by name, sharp by nature. He was virulently against women’s suffrage, and had refused to collect songs from black American singers. He published many of the songs that he collected in Somerset and beyond all under his name, and promoted himself as the expert on folk song, building a career on other people’s work. It would be easy to write a play that dismantled him, and yet there was a problem. Sharp had another side: he had great respect for the country people who sang, and managed to collect about 5,000 songs that, were it not for his writing them down in his notebooks, would otherwise have been lost. That dissonance would be at the heart of the play. I now had the story, but as the themes started to become clear, the complexity of the subject matter became overwhelming. The songs were also being gathered at a time when it was felt that England lacked a great classical composer. Since Purcell (who died in 1695), all the new music had been European and we were considered “Das Land ohne Musik” – the country without music. Sharp and his collecting peers hoped that these folk songs would stimulate composers to create a new classical music based on them, and place England at the centre of classical music once again.
Sharp furthermore saw these songs as having the potential to “refine and strengthen the national character” in the years before the first world war. This nationalism was the theme that caused me the most problems: it made me think about my feelings about my own country. The play is clearly about England, her songs and her landscape; I was writing it at a time when I felt a sense of nationalism rising as we headed into and out of the Brexit referendum, and, also, as the world around me was changing and questions were starting to be asked about the history of our country houses and artefacts in museums. History became more interesting and much more complex as it became more rigorous and more inclusive of others’ narratives. Sharp found “his” England very near where I am from. My imagination was born in my village in Somerset, and I have a creative attachment to the land. I look back on my life there with an extraordinary sense of richness, but I don’t know what to do with these feelings. How do I express that love without being nationalistic? And how do I express that love, knowing that to romanticise the past is to ignore the fact that there was an intolerance to difference and a casual racism in my own village where in 1977 dogs were still named the N-word.
I have come to see that the play is my way of working through those questions. Every time I write it is to find out what I think. Sharp raided the villages for the songs on which he built his career, yet he also saved the songs. The play demanded that I find a way to show those two dissonant facts in the same story. I also needed to find a way of showing that I love the place where I was born, without ignoring the complexities of that place and my feelings about it. As Louie Hooper says in my play: “Everyone loves their country. It’s just the bit of land where we was born, what we first see and smell. It’s the stories, the songs.” The songs Sharp collected did lead to many types of new music, including the big folk revival in the 60s, which still feeds folk musicians today; it also led to new classical music from Holst, Vaughan Williams and Butterworth, which in turn inspired Benjamin Britten. We owe all of this to Sharp, but we also owe it all to a pair of little-known sisters who lived on the edge of the water, right in the heart of the Somerset Levels. • Folk by Nell Leyshon is at Hampstead theatre until 5 February.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/05/folks-unsung-heroines-cecil-sharp-nell-leyshon-hampstead-theatre;5
202;202;5445;5445;This Twelfth night I’m packing away more than just my Christmas decorations | Emma Beddington;2022-01-05T13:37:32Z;['Emma Beddington'];['Christmas', 'Life and style'];"Twelfth night, and the following day’s Epiphany, is a time of ancient traditions: the adrenalised juggling of overdrafts, a ritual squabble with my best friend about whether frangipane, star of French Epiphany cakes, is tasty or terrible, and the dreary stripping away of any remaining Christmassy bits. Time to take down our favourites: the entirely featureless loo roll tube (a relic of some abortive “craft” project), the blue papier-mache lightbulb, origins unknown, the pink plastic owl that sees into your soul, and the inexplicable army of ornamental Scottie dogs, none of them bought by me. My husband will carefully wrap the tangled fairy lights around the ancestral copy of Super Picsou Géant (a French comic about Scrooge McDuck), as he has since time immemorial, and that will be that, fun over. There is, though, something invigorating about it. Sure, comfort and joy is nice, my inner zealot whispers, hairshirt rustling, smelling of bicarb and white vinegar, but have you seen this nice new broom? There are some seasonal things I am looking forward to putting away along with the decorations, and not all of them will be allowed out of the loft next year. Not knowing which day it is Listen, it’s time to get a grip. Today is definitely Wednesday, or maybe Thursday, or Friday. I have already missed one recycling collection, which ruined my entire (Tues?)day. From now on, I will just accept the verdict of whichever global corporation sold me the expensive device in my hand, even though, yes, it feels like Sunday for the ninth day running. Pregame LFTs Obviously I won’t stop taking rapid tests, assuming they are ever easier to get hold of than a Christmas Tickle Me Elmo in 1996. And there’s a certain satisfaction to be derived from a whole new swathe of the population getting to experience the special trepidation formerly associated with taking a pregnancy test. But by this point I need a very good reason to poke another stick at my tonsils rather than staying home and unblocking the sink. I’m so unused to social situations now, it’s not as if my open-mouthed silent staring adds anything to the party anyway. Wrapping paper Wrapping paper is on the brink of seeming as mad as smoking in restaurants or pouring sewage into the sea (oh, hang on – we still do that). You covered gifts in virgin paper (227,00 miles of it annually in the UK, apparently), then threw it in the bin? Sure, Grandma. I said I wouldn’t wrap this Christmas, but in the end decided to finish my existing stock, cack-handedly defying geometry and good taste, sausage fingers fighting with the elusive split ends of the sticky tape. The end result was pitiful, and when I took my bag of de-taped non-foil papers to the dump, I was instructed to put it in landfill anyway. Next year it’s newspaper (the only way my family would see anything I write) or nothing. Food hoarding A combination of Covid/Brexit scarcity and seasonal hysteria turned me into a shameful monster last month, not hoarding food for my family, but from them. Having snagged three bags of my favourite Lentil Waves crisps (yes, it’s all unbridled decadence chez Beddington), I hid them in my sock drawer. I also concealed the fancy olives behind a jar of piccalilli and the only promising clementines in my coat pocket. As I typed that, I remembered the chocolates hidden in my desk drawer (just checked – still there, still delicious). I have no idea what is wrong with me. I have never experienced scarcity; I am just a selfish, greedy pig deranged by 20 months of pictures of empty supermarket shelves. Enough. Bingeing television I feel confident that a lot of dark, boring hours lie between us and whenever things get less bleak (2026? Never?), so I cannot just go on consuming television as if it was an infinite resource. I need to learn to consume entertainment sustainably. For every fresh episode of something prestigious with Olivia Colman or the joyfully silly Tina Fey sitcom Girls5Eva, I am committing to five repeats or even – gasp – a conversation. Reduce, reuse, recycle. That sinking feeling when you hear the prime minister is holding a press conference The clutching dread, the impotence, the fury – the minute most of us see that lectern we’re triggered. I want to take that feeling, wrap it in newspaper and slide it into the darkest, dampest, most spider-infested corner of the loft. But unlike the beloved loo roll tube and lightbulb, I’m praying it doesn’t come out again. Emma Beddington is a freelance writer.

203;203;5446;5446;People urged to report Covid home test results after PCR follow-ups halted in England;2022-01-05T13:30:19Z;['Hannah Devlin', 'Rachel Hall'];['Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'Infectious diseases', 'Medical research', 'Microbiology', 'Biology', 'Science', 'World news', 'Health policy', 'Health', 'Politics', 'Public services policy', 'Society', 'NHS'];"People are being urged to register the results of home Covid tests after the announcement that follow-up PCRs will be suspended for asymptomatic people with a positive lateral flow test in England. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the shift reflected the high accuracy of the tests and prevalence of coronavirus, which means the chances of false positives are low. However, the new system will rely more heavily on people registering their own positive test result. A spokesperson said: “From the 11th, we would really encourage people to register results, especially if they’re positive, there is a greater need for that.” Lateral flow test results already feed into official daily Covid case numbers and, in England, represented almost a third of reported cases on 31 December. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, the chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, said: “It will become much more important that people report positive lateral flow tests otherwise nobody will know what’s going on. There’s already a problem with daily cases, with people not getting tested or not reporting results.” The change will apply only to those in England taking routine lateral flow tests who do not have any symptoms of coronavirus, and they must still report their result on gov.uk and self-isolate for the minimum seven days. Anyone with any of the three main Covid symptoms listed by the government, which are a high temperature, persistent cough and a loss or change to sense of smell or taste, must self-isolate, take a PCR test, and await the results. UKHSA said lateral flow devices (LFDs) were most effective for people without symptoms, with 80% accuracy in finding the people with high viral loads who are most infectious. The agency added that for every 10,000 lateral flow tests carried out, there are likely to be fewer than three false positive results.
The agency added that this approach replicated the one taken between January and March last year, when confirmatory PCR tests were also suspended. Jenny Harries, UKHSA’s chief executive, said: “While cases of Covid continue to rise, this tried-and-tested approach means that LFDs can be used confidently to indicate Covid-19 infection without the need for PCR confirmation.” There are a small number of exceptions to the change, including people eligible for the £500 test-and-trace support payment, people participating in research and surveillance programmes, and the 1 million people at risk of becoming seriously ill from coronavirus who have been contacted by the NHS. The care minister, Gillian Keegan, told the Today programme that the change was intended to reflect the “accuracy and the amount of lateral flow tests” rather than expressly to curb staff shortages. She said there were “no immediate plans” to reduce the seven-day minimum isolation period down to five if a negative lateral flow is obtained, but added that it was “a reasonable question to ask” and one that was being considered by scientists. About 1 million people are thought to be isolating due to Covid, causing widespread absences and disruption across essential services, including healthcare, police and food processing. Hospitals are reporting that they are struggling to cope with staff absences, with several declaring critical incidents and 17 in Greater Manchester saying they would suspend some non-urgent surgery as 15% of staff were off sick. An internal memo from the North East ambulance service foundation trust suggested that call handlers recommend people suffering from a heart attack or stroke get a lift into hospital from friends or family. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, told the Today programme that healthcare absences were averaging at about 10%, with Covid the biggest reason, but that this figure was much higher in some hospital trusts.

The Met Office issued three yellow warnings for dangerous weather conditions, including lightning strikes from isolated thunderstorms and as much as 10cm of snow falling on the highest ground, from 10am on Thursday until 11am on Friday across Scotland, Wales and northern England. In the Scottish Highlands, from 8pm on Thursday until 11am on Friday there will be “frequent sleet, hail and snow showers may lead to some disruption to travel during Thursday night and Friday morning”, with longer journey times expected for some roads and railways, icy patches and possible brief power outages.
In the south of Scotland, including Glasgow, and in parts of Northern Ireland and in England north of Manchester , snow will cause some travel disruption from 10am until 4pm on Thursday, according to a separate warning. The Met Office said there would up to two hours of snow in many areas with a risk of temporary slushy accumulations above 100 to 200 metres and strong winds leading to temporary blizzard conditions in higher areas. The Met Office said Thursday would be dry and cold to start across the UK, but with a band of cloud, wind and rain spreading eastwards, with this falling as snow in some areas although this will not remain for long. After an unseasonably warm few weeks, including a record-breaking New Year’s Day in which temperatures of 16C were recorded in London, the UK’s first widespread frost of the winter is expected to hit in the coming days, with overnight temperatures set to fall below freezing on Wednesday. The wet and snowy conditions will give way to sunnier and milder weather over the weekend, especially in the east, albeit with some outbreaks of blustery showers. Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said: “At the moment we’ve got a ridge of high pressure leading to clear skies. Into the early hours of tomorrow morning we’ll start to see a weather front approach from the west, bearing in mind conditions will have been intensely cold overnight with frost and freezing fog in southern parts of England. We’ll get this frontal band of precipitation working east, then as that cold air bumps into the weather front moving in we’ll see a line of snow along that front.” He said “thundersnow” would be caused by the difference between the cold front arriving from the west, reaching the ground that has been warmed by unseasonable temperatures. He added that the conditions were driven by the same meteorological conditions as storms in summer but that it can sound distinct, as it is muffled by snow.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/uk-weather-thundersnow-to-fall-from-thursday-warns-met-office;4
205;205;5448;5448;Liverpool’s Carabao Cup semi-final at Arsenal postponed after EFL ruling;2022-01-05T13:00:56Z;['Andy Hunter', 'Paul MacInnes'];['Liverpool', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Arsenal', 'Carabao Cup', 'Football League'];"The EFL has granted Liverpool’s request to postpone their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Arsenal on Thursday amid an escalating Covid outbreak at the club. Liverpool submitted the request on Tuesday on the grounds of player availability and a rising number of positive tests among the squad and staff. The assistant manager, Pepijn Lijnders, who has been in interim charge of the first team while Jürgen Klopp is in isolation, subsequently tested positive along with more players and staff. The club closed their first-team training facility on Wednesday after consultation with the relevant public health authorities.
The EFL said the postponement was down to “a severe outbreak of Covid infections” among Liverpool’s staff and players. The first leg of the tie will be played at Anfield next Thursday, when the second leg was due to take place, and the return leg the following Thursday. “The EFL has been in regular dialogue with the club over the past 48 hours in an attempt to understand whether the tie could proceed but significant developments over this period have resulted in the club reporting an ever-increasing number of Covid cases,” the league said. “Having now fully reviewed the circumstances involved, the league has accepted Liverpool’s request after determining, albeit reluctantly, that a postponement was the only option as the club looks to mitigate against the further risk of infection amongst its squad and staff alongside ensuring public health was protected by not travelling from Liverpool to London.” Liverpool’s first-team training facility is expected to be closed for at least 48 hours, which would affect preparations for the FA Cup third‑round tie at home against Shrewsbury on Sunday. The club’s development squads have separate facilities at Kirkby and could be utilised against the League One side in the event of Liverpool being short of first-team players. Aston Villa were forced to resort to similar measures for last season’s third-round tie against Liverpool after their entire first team “bubble” was placed into isolation. Nine Liverpool players were missing at Chelsea last Sunday, and Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and Naby Keïta have subsequently reported for the Africa Cup of Nations. In addition to Lijnders, who received his result on Tuesday night, the club have reported further positive tests for Covid among players and staff overnight and on Wednesday morning.
“Liverpool Football Club would like to place on record its thanks to the EFL and Arsenal for their understanding, as well as supporters of both clubs, as we continue to navigate through this challenging period,” the club said. Harrogate had to forfeit a first‑round match against Rochdale this season after a Covid outbreak in their squad. Under EFL rules any rearranged game must take place before the next round starts and whereas Harrogate were unable to manage that, there has been scope for Liverpool to fit in both legs before the final. When Leyton Orient forfeited their third-round tie against Tottenham last season a different set of rules were in operation. The Premier League is to end mandatory PCR testing for players and staff, with the changes coming into effect from Thursday. Clubs will be expected to conduct lateral flow tests every day in training and the day before matches, with a positive result requiring confirmation from the more precise PCR. Last month the league introduced a twice weekly PCR regime, then added daily lateral flow testing in response to the Omicron variant of Covid. But despite record levels of infection and 94 positive cases in the last round of testing completed over the new year weekend, the changes do conform with current government guidance on testing, which is placing more emphasis on LFTs for individuals without symptoms.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/liverpool-covid-arsenal-carabao-cup;4

According to Variety, the Globes’ talent bookers have failed to persuade any big Hollywood figures to attend the 2022 edition of the awards ceremony, a hitherto glittering annual event that traditionally kicked off the lucrative awards season. In March 2021 more than 100 public relations firms announced they would withdraw cooperation with the Globes, a series of high-profile Hollywood figures, including Tom Cruise and Scarlett Johansson, made stinging public criticisms, and TV network NBC cancelled its broadcast of the 2022 edition. In a statement on its website, the Golden Globes parent organisation Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) said that the ceremony would go ahead on Sunday at the Beverly Hilton hotel, and planned to “shine a light on the long-established philanthropy work of the HFPA, showcasing a range of grantees during the program”. The HFPA also said event will also “discuss” the Reimagine Coalition, an initiative announced in October 2021 and set up in conjunction with civil rights group the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to “increase diversity, equity, and inclusion across the global entertainment industry”. No press will be allowed inside the ceremony, and no red carpet will take place. Audience members will be required to wear masks, and follow strict Covid guidelines including proof of vaccination and negative tests. It has yet to be announced whether the ceremony will be livestreamed. The HFPA has been engulfed in crisis since the LA Times ran an exposé on the eve of the 2021 Golden Globes, accusing the organisation of a lack of diversity in its voting membership as well as “ethical lapses” in the way it conducted its business.

207;207;5450;5450;Geoff Hoon ‘told to burn memo that said Iraq invasion could be illegal’;2022-01-05T12:53:49Z;['Jessica Elgot'];['Geoff Hoon', 'Tony Blair', 'Iraq', 'UK news', 'Peter Goldsmith'];Tony Blair’s former defence secretary Geoff Hoon has claimed he was told to burn a memo from the attorney general that cast doubt on the legality of the Iraq war. In revelations that critics say cast further doubt on the decision to award the former prime minister a knighthood, Hoon recalled in extracts from his recently published memoir that Blair’s chief of staff had instructed him to burn the document. Hoon wrote in his memoir, See How They Run, that he had had been under pressure from Mike Boyce, the chief of defence staff, to provide him with clear legal direction that his forces could take action in Iraq, in lieu of a UN resolution authorising force, the Daily Mail reported. He claims to have received a copy of complex advice from the then attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, which was “very long and very detailed legal opinion”. He wrote: “I was sent a copy from Downing St under conditions of considerable secrecy. I was told that it was for my eyes only and that I should not discuss its contents with anyone else. I had no idea who else had received a copy.” Hoon said the advice was “not an easy read” and concluded that the Iraq invasion would be lawful only if the prime minister believed that it was in the UK’s national interest to do so. “It was not exactly the ringing endorsement that the chief of the defence staff was looking for, and in any event, I was not strictly allowed to show it to him or even discuss it with him,” he wrote. “Moreover, when my principal private secretary, Peter Watkins, called Jonathan Powell in Downing St and asked what he should now do with the document, he was told in no uncertain terms that he should ‘burn it’.” Hoon said the document was not burned. “I agreed that we should lock the document securely into an MoD safe to which only he had access. For all I know it is probably still there.” Powell told the Daily Mail he had not ordered the advice to be burned and described it as a separate “minute” that he had asked Hoon to destroy on Goldsmith’s request. In his memoir, Hoon also describes the humiliation of being sacked as defence secretary two years later, saying Blair phoned him to tell him the news rather than meet face-to-face. More than 700,000 people have now signed a petition to rescind Blair’s knighthood, awarded by the Queen in the new year honours list. But the decision to award him the honour was defended by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who said on Tuesday it was “not a thorny issue” to give the award to someone who had served a long term as prime minister. “I understand there are strong views on the Iraq war. There were back at the time and there still are, but that does not detract from the fact that Tony Blair was a very successful prime minister of this country and made a huge difference to the lives of millions of people in this country,” Starmer said.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/05/geoff-hoon-told-to-burn-memo-that-said-iraq-invasion-could-be;6
208;208;5451;5451;UK to investigate tattoo ink health risks after EU ban;2022-01-05T12:48:09Z;"[""Lisa O'Carroll""]";['Tattoos', 'UK news', 'European Union', 'World news', 'Fashion', 'Europe', 'Health', 'Health policy', 'Politics'];"The UK government is to investigate the health risks posed by tattoo inks after the EU introduced a ban on a range of substances used in pigments on the grounds they are hazardous. The ban, which came into force on Monday, has caused a crisis in the tattoo industry across the bloc, with trade associations warning it will “criminalise” artists and threaten the entire sector, which is already reeling from closures through the pandemic lockdowns. The law does not apply to the UK as it came into effect after Brexit was sealed in January 2020 but it poses one of the first tests for the UK’s approach to regulation of laws affecting consumers since it achieved independence from the bloc.
The law limits the use of certain chemicals the EU says are hazardous, with some linked to cancer, reproductive difficulties and skin irritation, and which are contained in mixtures for tattoo inks and permanent makeup. It is estimated that 54 million people across the EU have tattoos and the industry had a year to prepare for the ban. The tattoo artist Tin-Tin, who heads the French tattoo industry union SNAT, told Reuters the new rules would drive people to parlours that do not respect the legislation. “It’s ridiculous. It’s like taking the flour from a bakery, it’s as stupid as that. If we don’t have any colours or ink to work with, what are we going to work with?” he said. Dolores Murray, who owns Wild Cat Ink in Dublin, told RTÉ radio in Ireland the ban would affect about 4,000 substances used in tattoo inks, including isopropyl alcohol, a disinfecting lotion used in the process. She read a statement from the European Society of Tattoo Pigment Research that said the ban was not argued sufficiently and would lead to the criminalisation of tattoo artists. “What we are looking for is a little time to try and get this whole mess sorted out,” she said. A worker at one tattoo parlour in London said they had heard about the ban but had been given “no information” as to whether or not it applied in the post-Brexit UK. EU laws up to January 2020 were incorporated into domestic law but those agreed since are not. However, the UK said it would take the scientific research in the EU into consideration.
A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which is responsible for the UK’s registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (UK Reach), said: “UK Reach allows the UK to make its own decisions on the regulation of chemicals that are based on the best available scientific evidence, ensuring that chemicals remain safely used and managed. “The government has asked the Health and Safety Executive [HSE] to prepare a dossier to review the risk posed by certain substances in tattoo inks and consider the case for introducing any restrictions,” said the spokesperson. The UK government asked the HSE last March to consider the case for imposing any restrictions. Defra said this was because the ink in tattoos could sometime cause health effects, most commonly skin reactions, such as irritation or sensitisation. It added that the restriction proposal “will consider … but is not limited to, substances that can cause cancer, are dangerous to reproduction, skin sensitisers and irritants”. It would introduce its draft restriction dossiers in spring 2022, after which there would be a public consultation, it said. Defra added that if evidence showed there was an unacceptable risk to human health, it would impose bans on certain inks.";https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/05/uk-investigate-tattoo-ink-health-risk-after-eu-ban;6
209;209;5452;5452;Feel the sequins: touch tours and headset hosts are a sensation for visually impaired audiences;2022-01-05T12:41:27Z;['Caroline Butterwick'];['Theatre', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Curve theatre', 'Blindness and visual impairment', 'Disability', 'Health', 'Society', 'Musicals'];"Growing up, trips to the theatre for me involved squinting at the stage, unable to follow what was happening. Being partially sighted, plays have felt out of my reach. But now here I am standing on the stage at Curve theatre in Leicester, running my fingers along the delicate gold sequins of a costume for A Chorus Line. There are around a dozen of us at this pre-show talk for visually impaired people, which gives us a chance to familiarise ourselves with the performance we’ll be watching in an hour’s time. Before the pandemic, this pre-show talk would have taken the form of a touch tour, where we’d get to feel more of the costumes and set. Today we can only touch two costumes due to Covid safety precautions, but even through the thin gloves we wear, I can feel the texture, the snag of chiffon and sequins, and see details up close. Our guide, Nadine Beasley for Talking Sense Audio Description Services, tells us how the bright lighting in the show’s finale will make these outfits dazzle. We see several other costumes as Beasley talks us through the rack of leotards and checked shirts, telling us which outfit belongs to which character. She also describes the set and gives us the background to A Chorus Line. Beth Hinton-Lever, who plays Bebe in the show, pops in to introduce herself and gives a helpful description of what she will look like on stage. The talk leaves me with a grounding in the play, the set and its characters, and I feel tentatively hopeful that it’ll help me follow the action. Many theatres offer accessible performances, with adaptations from sign language and captioning to dementia-friendly and relaxed viewings. I asked artist Jamie Hale, who recently directed CRIPtic Pit Party at the Barbican, about theatre access. They told me about some of the barriers they experience, such as lack of wheelchair access, and having to phone to book accessible tickets. While there have been improvements, the inclusion of more disabled people in the industry, Hale says, would increase theatre’s accessibility. Tonight’s performance of A Chorus Line will be audio-described by Beasley, giving a live account of the action, delivered via headsets that still allow us to hear everything happening on stage. Other audience members won’t hear the audio description. We return to the auditorium about 20 minutes before the show. While I fiddle with the volume on my headset, Beasley reads us an audio introduction. She describes the stage layout again, everything from the large mirrors at the back to details such as the 1970s-style red telephone pinned to the left wall. She also runs through the main characters, describing their hair, faces, eyes, clothes and how they carry themselves. It’s a colourful explanation: we learn that the character Mike “moves with a youthful swagger, sporting a cheeky smile” and Sheila “smoulders like a 1930s femme fatale”. Still, I’m nervous about whether I’ll be able to follow the play once it begins.
Soon the stage is filled with figures dancing. From my seat three rows from the front, I can see the flow of people moving, and Beasley’s description helps me make sense of it. She explains the choreography throughout the show, the “arms flailing, feet tapping”, “undulating twists”, pirouettes and leaps, characters sashaying across the stage, the shapes they cast with their bodies. It brings their movements to life in my mind. She describes other actions, such as characters stepping forward or leaving the stage, and expressions too – characters’ eyes locking, or them fidgeting nervously. She captures the tenderness of the moment when Zach and Paul hug, describing the warmth of their embrace. I feel the weight of it with the same strength as fully sighted audience members. The commentary feels natural, never distracting from the action or dialogue.
I recognise outfits from the pre-show talk, and spot Bebe quickly, remembering how Hinton-Lever described the character’s long red hair. During the finale, my mind goes back to the look and feel of the golden costumes, and how Beasley said they sparkle in the light. One of the hardest things about watching theatre growing up was not being able to tell which character was speaking. When you can’t see people’s lips move, voices hang unaccounted for, detached from physical form. When the pace allows, Beasley says the name of a character before they speak or sing. And this, perhaps more than anything, makes a huge difference for me. For the first time, I’m able to follow a play. And it’s a revelation. I can enjoy theatre! I feel included. I am part of this shared experience. As I leave the auditorium and hand back my headset, I have joyously entered a new world, one I once felt I didn’t belong in but am now excited to explore.";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/05/feel-the-sequins-touch-tours-and-headset-hosts-are-a-sensation-for-visually-impaired-audiences;5

The businessman Lewis Taylor, the founder and managing director of the energy company Energy Angels, is poised to take over Coventry, who said on 23 December that they were going into voluntary liquidation.
That process, overseen by the accountancy firm BK Plus, was due to be completed on 4 January. But BK Plus said on Wednesday that those instructions were terminated at 4.52pm that day. Thirty players and staff were due to have their contracts of employment terminated at Coventry, who are halfway through their first season as a fully professional club. Richard Tonks, insolvency practitioner at BK Plus said: “Notice of the liquidation caused understandable disappointment to everyone connected with the club, not least the players and staff. Notice of the proceedings also gathered a lot of external interest and concern, and resulted in offers to try and save the club from parties in the UK and abroad.” Tonks added: “We were pleased to be part of the process resulting in the agreement of heads of terms to sell the company’s shares … Clearly, a sale still needs to be finalised and we remain on hand to support all of the relevant parties with a view to completing a sale as soon as possible.”
The Women’s Championship season has been on a winter break but is due to resume this weekend. Taylor, whose company sponsors Wolves Women in the third tier, told Sky Sports News that he had held virtual meetings on New Year’s Day with the manager, Jay Bradford, and the players. “We’ve had a really positive response from the squad,” he said. “We will shore the situation up very quickly and get the players paid for a start.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/womens-championship-club-coventry-united-avoid-liquidation;4
211;211;5454;5454;Jan Åge Fjørtoft: ‘I almost get tears when I talk about my first Swindon goal’;2022-01-05T12:30:33Z;['Paul Doyle'];['Swindon', 'FA Cup', 'Football', 'Sport'];"About this time 28 years ago the star of Swindon Town’s only season in the top flight finally started scoring. Jan Åge Fjørtoft had been signed in the summer of 1993 for a club‑record £1.3m to spearhead Swindon’s attack on the Premier League but he failed to find the net in the first half of the campaign and was on his way out until a goal in an FA Cup third-round replay against Ipswich in January 1994 triggered a dramatic change in his fortunes. But not, alas, in those of Swindon, whose elan going forward could not offset ramshackle defending. The club wound up being relegated after conceding 100 goals, the first top‑flight team in 30 years to reach that undignified milestone and still the only team to do so in the Premier League era. “I almost get tears in my eyes when I talk about my first goal in that January,” says Fjørtoft, a 54-year-old pundit for television channels in Germany and his native Norway, before Swindon play Manchester City in the Cup’s third round on Friday. He cherishes his memories of Swindon and of a season in which he and his team endured harrowing lows while trying, and sometimes succeeding, to play stylish and enterprising football.
“We conceded 100 goals, finished bottom and are considered the symbol of a side not doing well in the Premier League but we weren’t a bad side, we were not that far away,” says Fjørtoft. “We were a very good football team with a lot of good players and we were quite confident on the ball. To be fair, we were useless at defending.” Swindon had won promotion to the top flight with such brio that their manager, Glenn Hoddle, was hired by Chelsea, leaving his assistant, John Gorman, to plot their assault on the Premier League. He was determined to stay faithful to their slick passing approach. Signing Fjørtoft was supposed to add a sharper tip to their attack. To be fair, he was useless at first. Swindon did not win until they beat Queens Park Rangers 1-0 in their 16th league match, by which time Fjørtoft, still goalless, had been dropped.
“In the first game of the season at Sheffield United [lost 3-1], I got a knock,” says Fjørtoft, bought after four free-scoring seasons with Rapid Vienna. “I had never been injured in my life and that was the start of a bad circle for me. I kept on playing because I was desperate to get that first goal and contribute to our first win. We were suffering heavy losses and it became the first time in my life that I didn’t score goals. I started to doubt myself. When you start losing your self-confidence, you make compromises in the way you play and then you kind of drag yourself further into the dump. By the time of that win against QPR, I was struggling. “Then Christmas Eve of 1993 was the lowest point of my career. I played for Swindon reserves against Wycombe Wanderers reserves on one of these fantastic facilities you have in England with like 12 pitches next to each other. It was cold and windy, I was freezing to death and I was the worst player on the pitch. I remember I came home and opened the door and said dramatically to my wife: ‘Have a look at me now because no one can ever get lower in their football career than I am now.’” Paradoxically, Fjørtoft was thriving on the international stage. But to retain his place in the Norway side for the 1994 World Cup he needed to improve his club form, so he negotiated a loan to Lillestrøm. “I had agreed it with them but then came the Cup game against Ipswich.” Fjørtoft scored in a game Swindon lost 2-1. “The next morning I went into Swindon town centre to get something for my wife and I saw posters for the local paper with the headline ‘Please don’t go, Jan.’ It was all over the place. That was an unbelievable moment.” An amazing transformation took place. Suddenly flush with confidence, Fjørtoft cancelled the loan and became convinced he would open his Premier League account against Tottenham four days later, in Swindon’s 27th league game. “After 20 minutes [the Spurs goalkeeper] Erik Thorstvedt, who was my roommate with the national team, got injured and as he was being carried off I went up to him and screamed ‘Fucking coward!’ because I somehow knew I was going to score my first goal in the Premier League. I thought he wasn’t daring enough to stay on.” Fifteen minutes later Fjørtoft did indeed score, flicking the ball over Colin Calderwood before thrashing it past Thorstvedt’s replacement, Ian Walker.
The floodgates opened: in the final 16 games of the season Fjørtoft scored 12 goals, a tally bettered only by Southampton’s Matt Le Tissier. “I developed a very good understanding with Nicky Summerbee, who was one of the best crossers of the ball I played with,” says Fjørtoft. “I used to say I had no clue why I couldn’t score in the first half of the season and then scored for fun in the second half but now, when I look back, I see it’s about that circle you get into with a lack of confidence.” It was not enough to save Swindon. Although they scored more goals than Aston Villa and Coventry, who both finished in the top half, their inability to plug their leaky defence meant they won five of 42 matches. Their heaviest defeat came in March when they lost 7-1 at Newcastle. “We were sitting on the bus on the way home and Shaun Taylor – our captain and warrior – said: ‘Well at least Andy Cole didn’t score.’ And I said: ‘Every other Newcastle player did!’ The next day John Gorman – who I love – came to me and said: ‘Jan, we did some great passing yesterday.’ That sums up our season. We loved our game. We just wanted to play.
“You could call it naive, that’s probably the right analysis, but [Gorman] was a romantic. He really loved passes: if we made five passes, it was almost like three points for him and I say that in a positive way. He just loved to play football. I think it’s cool you have guys like that in the game. “The other thing to say is that if we were a team who had played very disciplined and sat back and all that, I’m not sure we would have got more points.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/jan-age-fjrtoft-i-almost-get-tears-when-i-talk-about-my-first-swindon-goal;4
212;212;5455;5455;European players granted permission to compete in Saudi International ;2022-01-05T12:30:01Z;['Ewan Murray'];['Golf', 'Sport', 'Saudi Arabia'];"The DP World Tour – the recently rebranded European Tour – will grant permission to players to take part in the controversial Saudi International next month following weeks of intense negotiations. By the Monday deadline, between 30 and 40 members of the tour had requested releases to play in the Asian Tour-run event near Jeddah, from 3 February. It is sponsored by the Saudi public investment fund and carries huge appearance fees.
Despite speculation of potential bans for European players who compete in the Saudi International, dismissed by some as little more than a cash grab, it is understood they should be informed this week that releases will be granted with conditions relating to future commitments to DP World Tour tournaments. Should those conditions not be met there is scope for disciplinary action, but player power has seemingly won the day. Until now, the Tour has only publicly stated that it is considering each player’s application on merit. The Saudi International has publicised a field including players such as Paul Casey, Tommy Fleetwood, Sergio García, Tyrrell Hatton, Shane Lowry, Henrik Stenson, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood. All required DP World Tour grace. It remains to be seen how seriously, if at all, Stenson’s Saudi involvement harms his aspirations of being Europe’s 2023 Ryder Cup captain. Whether or not top golfers are independent traders or bound by membership criteria of tours has been the subject of much debate. The tournament was once the domain of the then European Tour, before Saudi Arabia’s attempts to make significant inroads into the professional game, saw them cold-shouldered by that body and the PGA Tour. Saudi Arabia’s hefty financial commitment to golf has included Greg Norman being hired as head of an investment group, which will spearhead lucrative events on the Asian Tour and has aspirations of a breakaway league. Given the finances on offer, player heads have been turned.
The PGA Tour has confirmed members could play in the Saudi International if conditions are met, specific to the future staging of the Farmers Insurance Open if played on the same date. There was then an expectancy Europe would follow suit – the Tours have a strategic alliance – but the situation was less straightforward for an organisation which seeks tournament commitments from players in umpteen countries. In theory, the DP World Tour also has more to fear in regards to a talent drain towards a Saudi-backed scheme. It is also expected the DP World Tour has granted a small number of releases pursued by members wanting to feature in the Singapore Open, which sits directly against the Abu Dhabi Championship this month.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/european-players-granted-permission-to-compete-in-saudi-international-golf;4

Toast (Matt Berry) has relocated to Hollywood, following three series of Toast of London – which saw him tailspinning through demeaning bit parts, mortifying scandals and doomed auditions since its launch in 2013. Now, Toast believes he will finally get his due, and the great wrong of his omission from the acting pantheon will be righted. There is one tiny problem, though: the acting pantheon doesn’t want him. He doesn’t even make it to the opening credits of Toast of Tinseltown’s first episode before a furious Larry David is yelling: “Are you serious? Is this guy a real actor?” To see Toast in action is to be treated to the enthralling spectacle of a man who unshakeably believes that he is one of the finest thespians of his generation, despite being the recipient of worst actor awards. For the whole of the first series, rotten-veg-hurling protesters greet him upon his entrance to the stage door of the production he’s appearing in – dubbed London’s worst play. He gets the kind of radioactive reviews that have sunk the careers of better men, has been cancelled by the literal PC police and was once buried alive by a maverick director. Toast wants to be the Milk Tray man, but ends up as Basildon Bond. He’s the ultimate fish out of water, an analogue actor in the digital age. Even his rivalries are the stuff of Greek myth – eternal conflicts played out by idiots. As the screen and stage work dries up, he is reduced to cornball voiceovers where he is tormented by the millennial inanities of hipster sound guys Danny Bear (Tim Downie) and Clem Fandango (Shazad Latif). Toast facing down these Urban Outfitters rejects who have him read out obscene hearing aid adverts, honking horns and whinnying like a horse offers a joy seldom seen on TV. You watch as the generation gap becomes a chasm. But the real joy is his ultimate rivalry with Ray Purchase (Harry Peacock)– a taller, leaner, more handsome Toast, who looks like a Reader’s Digest knitwear model. In the first episode of Toast of Tinseltown, the ludicrously OTT competition for a movie role and the affections of Mrs Purchase (Tracy-Ann Oberman) has Toast karate-chopping desks in half, with Purchase’s moustache writhing so furiously it’s in danger of leaping clear off his face. The raw physical presence of Peacock’s scenery-chewing Purchase bumping up against Toast’s unbridled contempt and hauteur make it an unmissable watch. Berry’s role as Toast is responsible for the best performances of his career. Some say that Matt Berry always plays Matt Berry and, admittedly, if you’re looking for the range of Daniel Day-Lewis, you will be disappointed. But this is to miss the point – Berry’s work is best seen as a single piece of performance art, a career-long excavation of a very specific kind of near-extinct masculinity – all Old Spice, coiffured hair and hammy glares. So of course there are deep echoes of previous characters: Doctor Sanchez in Darkplace, Douglas Reynholm in The IT Crowd, his perma-foiled suitor from Snuff Box. Toast, though, is the apex predator of Matt Berry characters. The rest are merely pale imitations. This is especially true given what a showcase Toast is for Berry’s unique musical output. Many episodes feature absurdist musical numbers that see him do things like duet with a moustachioed child version of himself about the shame of visiting a sex worker. Then there’s the surprisingly catchy masonic ritual ditty On the Square. Given the influence of co-writer/creator Arthur Mathews, there are characters and scenes that wouldn’t be out of place in Father Ted – although the prospect of a Ted/Toast cinematic universe seems likely to remain a pipe dream. Dreams are sometimes all we have, though, and the saga of Steven Toast is all about one man’s dream to achieve the recognition he manifestly does not deserve. That thick-eared tenacity is the main thing that makes him relatable. If you’ve ever felt out of your depth at work, bewildered by some aspect of youth culture or unjustly overlooked then all of a sudden, he starts to make sense. He’ll never quit. Deny it all you like, but there’s a bit of Toast in all of us.;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/05/one-of-the-best-comic-creations-of-the-last-10-years-matt-berry-is-back-as-steven-toast;5
214;214;5457;5457;Norman Mailer has not been ‘cancelled’, his son insists;2022-01-05T12:15:32Z;['Alison Flood'];['Books', 'Culture', 'Publishing', 'Random House', 'Michael Wolff', 'US news'];"Norman Mailer’s son has denied reports that the late writer has been “cancelled” over his controversialist views. Earlier this week, the journalist Michael Wolff, author of the Trump White House exposé Fire and Fury, claimed in an article for The Ankler that a planned collection of Mailer’s political writings to mark the centennial of his birth next year had been cancelled by Random House. According to Wolff, one of the reasons for the cancellation was “a junior staffer’s objection to the title of Mailer’s 1957 essay, The White Negro”. But the New York Times has now reported that the collection, including unpublished writings, has been acquired by Skyhorse, the independent press which also picked up Woody Allen’s memoir after it was dropped by Hachette, and Blake Bailey’s biography of Philip Roth after it was dropped by WW Norton. John Buffalo Mailer, told the paper that his father’s longtime publisher Random House had declined to make an offer for the book. While he said that “we would have liked to have done this book with them”, he speculated that the publisher turned it down “because this is the first commercial book of Norman’s that’s going to come out in the era we’re living in, and there’s going to be a lot of questions”.
“They didn’t feel they were the right house to do this book right now,” he told the New York Times. “I don’t think they have any interest in trying to cancel Norman Mailer. You can’t cancel Norman Mailer.” Random House said in a statement that it was “factually incorrect that Random House cancelled an upcoming book of essays by Norman Mailer” and that the book was never under contract. Literary agent Andrew Wylie, representing the Mailer estate, told the New York Times that “Random House is proud to publish Norman Mailer, and intends to promote his work significantly for the centennial, in tandem with the publication by Skyhorse of the anthology”. Mailer died aged 84 in 2007. He was the recipient of two Pulitzer prizes, for his 1968 account of a peace march on the Pentagon, The Armies of the Night, and for his 1979 work The Executioner’s Song, about the life and death of a criminal, Gary Gilmore. Controversial and pugnacious, he was also known for stabbing his second wife Adele Morales with a penknife, puncturing her cardiac sac.";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/05/norman-mailer-has-not-been-cancelled-his-son-insists-random-house-essays;5
215;215;5458;5458;Jami Attenberg: ‘Rejection gave me a fresh start, a new year’;2022-01-05T12:14:24Z;['Jami Attenberg'];['Creative writing', 'Fiction', 'Books', 'Culture'];"When I was 21, a man considered to be an authority on literature suggested I not become a writer. It was a few days before I graduated from college with a degree in creative writing. The National Book award-winning writer who had taught our senior fiction seminar told me, quite gently, to give up on my dreams. I can picture so clearly that room where we sat together, him behind a desk, sunlight streaming in from the windows behind him. He was not happy to see me when I walked in the door. I was young and punk and weird and had big hair. He was 55, bearded, grey and bespectacled. All semester, he had barely critiqued my stories, remaining quiet in class as my peers rattled off suggestions and ideas. He returned printouts of my work with just a few scribbles added. And now here I was visiting him in his office, ready for the moment where he would tell me where I could improve, what paths he thought I should take. He asked me what I wanted to do after graduation, and I told him I wanted to write. He said: “You know, honey, not everyone makes it as a writer.” I walked out of his office, dazed and discouraged. I suppose I had wanted him to say: “You’re a genius. Let me make a few calls and get you an agent. Or a job that will set you on your way.”
Perhaps he thought I didn’t have talent. Or, perhaps he saw me as frivolous. I was writing stories about sex and relationships and so-called domestic matters. I remember I wrote an entire short story about a woman waiting to get her period. He wrote big, sprawling novels that were about soldiers and war and violence. Maybe he didn’t enjoy teaching; he had never seemed excited to be there. To discourage someone from even trying, though? To say “give up” before I’d even gotten started? Writing is holy, as my friend Patricia Lockwood says. It is true that it is hard to make it as a writer, or any kind of artist, for that matter. But if you love to write, you should write forever. For years I have used this story as inspiration. He told me I couldn’t, and yet somehow I did anyway. He was an older man, negative and condescending. I’ll show him, I thought. But it is only recently that I realised that moment was actually radically freeing. I was probably not suited to be a writer in the way he thought was important. But that did not mean I was not suited to be a writer. In a way, he gave me a fresh start, a new year. The first of January of the rest of my life. In fact, he was telling me the truth as he knew it. The career path of a fiction writer in 1993 was defined but also limited. Achieving a master of fine arts degree, perhaps adjunct teaching, submitting to literary journals, the New Yorker, Granta,the Paris Review, every little journal across America, applying for grants and residencies, maybe working toward tenure. A lot of it sounded like the kind of work that I wouldn’t be any good at.
But that was what was available at the time. There were no obvious workarounds coming out of the academic world. What I took away from him was that I would have to carve my own path. No problem, easy-peasy. I only had to fail a hundred times to get there, get terrible reviews until I got good reviews, go broke once or twice (OK thrice), toss out any idea of achieving conventional life goals, and essentially edit my very existence in service of being a writer. But I was that, after all, even if it took more than a decade to arrive there. I took dozens of jobs I could quit easily – and often did. I waited tables, tended bars and temped in a blur of offices across the US. I made so many mistakes, but I was always keeping my eye on the prize: the time to read and write and think. No matter what, I always found my way back to writing. That’s the part that kept me sane all along. Not selling a book or publishing a book but making the book in the first place. Finally, I landed in New York City. I worked in advertising, writing bits of terrible copy to keep the lights on. I went to readings and studied other writers. I started to give readings myself. I made a few zines. The whole time I wasn’t thinking about literary credibility. I just wanted to write because it was the thing I loved best. I was building this creative life without consciously knowing it. I found my way to the internet in the late 90s. I started as someone with a blog. It wasn’t the way you were supposed to do it at the time, but it was the way that made the most sense to me. There was no splashy short story debut in the New Yorker. But I attracted a readership, and worked my way into writing essays, more zines and then a short book with a small press, and then very blindly and naively writing a linked story collection, my first with a big press, 13 years after I had graduated from college. Things have gotten a little easier as time has gone on, but still I never relax. There is no coasting in a creative life; we are constantly adjusting, altering, tending our paths. And there’s a lot of insecurity: about money, your identity, your place in the world, your reviews, your relevance. A few things have helped me along the way: ideas or actions to continue stimulating my growth as a person and an artist. Travelling is one. I’ve driven across country, caught trains to different cities and ridden my bike all over New York City in search of a new cafe or a sculpture garden I hadn’t seen before. Even just walking everywhere I can has been helpful, eyes up, paying attention, watching, listening. And I have read constantly, outside my genre as well as within it. Reading is the surest path to understanding. It leads to a fullness within us. I focused on friendships, too, becoming part of a cohort I didn’t necessarily know I was developing – I have always just been so excited to meet other writers. I went to readings and drinks after literary conferences, sent emails and liked tweets because I wanted to. The extra gift is that these people end up being your best cheerleaders and critics alike. I found the ones who would tell me the truth, and who wanted me to succeed – and I have tried to be that person for them, as well.
I looked for role models, too, when I was starting out. I looked up to the writers who led the way by being inventive in form or genre, or giving voice to characters of all kinds, or who smashed through glass ceilings or knocked down gates. I paid attention to them and was inspired by them. I could never have planned for it to work out the way it did. I have written eight books and will probably write at least a few more. I live a quiet life with my dog in a small house with a nice back yard where I have finally stopped killing everything I plant. I treasure my friendships and the endless pile of notebooks I keep filling, marvelling occasionally at how there are always, somehow, more words in the world. There is always a fresh start when I open a new notebook. It is always 1 January when I turn to the first page. I recently turned 50, nearly 30 years since that (now deceased) old teacher of mine told me I probably shouldn’t bother. I’m old enough to realise that there is one more important part to carving out your creative life: honouring your successes no matter the size. And honouring the bad moments too. Laying your burdens down. Building this writing life has always been about recognising what was holding me back so I could move on. One writer told me no. I honour his rejection. He said no, but I said yes. • I Came All This Way to Meet You by Jami Attenberg is published by Profile Books (£14.99). To order a copy for £13.04, go to guardianbookshop.com.

216;216;5459;5459;Sony to start electric car firm as it ‘explores a commercial launch’;2022-01-05T12:10:17Z;['Jasper Jolly'];['Sony', 'Automotive industry', 'Business', 'Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars', 'Technology', 'Japan', 'Manufacturing sector', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news'];"Sony has revealed plans to start an electric car company, making it the latest electronics manufacturer to target the automotive sector. The Japanese tech firm is “exploring a commercial launch” of electric vehicles, and will launch a new company, Sony Mobility Inc, in the spring, its chairman and president, Kenichiro Yoshida, told a news conference before the Consumer Electronics Show in the US. Yoshida on Wednesday presented a prototype sport utility vehicle, the Vision-S 02, which uses the same electric vehicle platform as the previously announced Vision-S 01, a coupe that began testing on public roads in Europe from December 2020.
“With our imaging and sensing, cloud, 5G and entertainment technologies combined with our content mastery, we believe Sony is well positioned as a creative entertainment company to redefine mobility,” he said. An increasing number of consumer electronics companies have looked into targeting the burgeoning electric car market. The success of the US electric carmaker Tesla has made it into one of the highest-valued companies in the world, and has spurred a host of potential imitators, ranging from traditional automotive companies to startups. Tokyo-listed shares in Sony Group rose by 3.7% on Wednesday, outperforming flat Japanese benchmark indices. Electric cars present fewer barriers to entry for potential new entrants because they have fewer moving parts, while autonomous cars (which are still in development) are expected to open a new opportunity to sell entertainment and services to passengers. Sony was the first company to commercialise the use of the lithium ion battery, which was invented by academics at the University of Oxford, and are now used by electric cars. The technology allowed Sony to become a leader in portable consumer electronics, such as camcorders, CD players and laptops.
The tech company’s operations span from consumer electronics such as the PlayStation games console, smartphones and TV sets, to entertainment including music, games, and film production. It also has a semiconductors business that already targets the automotive sector. Apple, the consumer electronics firm that this week became the first company to hit a $3tn valuation, is aiming to produce a self-driving car by 2025, according to a November report by Bloomberg. Yet CES has also highlighted that the traditional manufacturers will not give up their market share easily. On Monday, Mercedes-Benz revealed a concept car that it said could cover 620 miles on a single charge, enough for a journey from Brighton on England’s south coast to Inverness in northern Scotland without stopping.";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/05/sony-to-start-electric-car-firm-explores-commercial-launch;2
217;217;5460;5460;Top 10 books about musical subcultures | Kelefa Sanneh;2022-01-05T12:10:08Z;['Kelefa Sanneh'];['Music books', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Pop and rock', 'Music', 'Punk', 'R&B'];"I still have the mixtape that transformed me, at 14, from a casual consumer of whatever music my friends liked into a zealous partisan of punk rock. It’s an odd little cassette: 60 minutes of music, cohesive enough to suggest that punk rock was a thing, but variegated enough to suggest that could be just about anything. There was, apparently, a whole ocean of music more or less like this stuff. All I had to do was dive in. Punk rock is, perhaps, an unusually fractious genre: for decades, punks argued about what – and who – was or wasn’t punk. They drew lines, divided subgenres into sub-subgenres, and sometimes performed rituals of excommunication. (Green Day, probably the most popular punk group of all time, were banned from their local club, and denounced as enemies of the movement by Maximum Rocknroll, the definitive American punk fanzine.) For a while, punk rock was all I cared about, but in the years that followed I was pleased to discover that punk wasn’t quite as unusual as I first thought: every musical genre is in some sense a community of musicians and listeners, which means that every genre is also a tribe, defined by tribal rules of inclusion and exclusion. And so when I set out to write a history of popular music, I decided to go genre by genre, hoping to explain how these communities endured, evolved and splintered. In Major Labels, I settled on seven “major” genres: rock’n’roll, R&B, country, punk, hip-hop, dance music and pop. Of course, each of these contains multitudes, and one of the pleasures of writing the book was the chance to read, or revisit, countless works of single-minded musical scholarship: books that dive deep into a genre, or a scene, or a sound. This is one of the paradoxes of musical fandom: the more you cherish the ability to listen to a wide range of styles, the more grateful you should be to the musicians stubborn enough to find something they loved and stick to it. And the more grateful you should be, too, to the writers who were imaginative and perceptive enough to notice that something was going on, and write about it. 1. Deep Down in the Ghetto by Roger D Abrahams In 1964, a folklorist based in Philadelphia managed a neat trick: he published one of the most important books ever written about hip-hop, long before hip-hop actually existed. In this classic study, Abrahams records and analyses a trove of mid-century Black oral literature, setting down street-corner rhymes, tall tales and boasts – some of which are as violent, and as bawdy, as the rap records that shocked the world in the decades to come. 2. The Nashville Sound by Paul Hemphill Hemphill was not exactly a Nashville insider, which explains part of the charm of this book, published in 1970: he captured the genius and the weirdness of a country-music industry that was just starting to think of itself as such. Like virtually everyone who came after him, he noted that the genre seemed split between “traditionalists” and “the new breed”. He noticed that the town was full of performers who were “modernising the simple music of their rural southern childhoods and blurring the distinction between country and pop music” – and of course it still is.
3. Like Punk Never Happened by Dave Rimmer A very strange book: a sharp treatise on the aesthetics of pop, masquerading as a just-in-time biography of Boy George and Culture Club. In fact by the time this book was published, in 1985, Culture Club’s time at the top of the charts was pretty much over. Knowing this adds some wistfulness to Rimmer’s narrative. And it adds some context to his argument, which is that, in the aftermath of the punk explosion, a new “pop” sensibility emerged, rebelling against the punk-rock rebellion by steadfastly refusing to be rebellious. So what if it didn’t last? Who says great pop is supposed to last? 4. I’m With the Band by Pamela Des Barres When this book was published, at the peak of the hair-metal craze, some readers might have mistaken it for a gossipy compendium of backstage tales. The book’s subtitle is Confessions of a Groupie, but the main draw is the way that Des Barres, sometimes drawing from old diary entries, charts her evolution from a curious consumer of rock ’n’ roll records to an important participant in the scene that helped create the myth of the rock star. Her writing is precise and perceptive, affectionate but unsentimental. In one memorable passage, she remembers listening to Led Zeppelin II while hanging out in Jimmy Page’s hotel room. “I had to comment on every solo,” she writes, “and even though I believed the drum solo in Moby Dick went on endlessly, I held my tongue and went on pressing his velvet trousers and sewing buttons on to his satin jacket.”
5. The Death of Rhythm and Blues by Nelson George For much of the 1980s, George was a music editor at Billboard magazine, which gave him extraordinary insight not only into the genre of R&B but the industry that nurtured it. This classic study is both a history and a manifesto – and also, more than 30 years later, a time capsule. George writes tenderly about the Black business owners who supported R&B, and sceptically about the way that 80s R&B singers (including Michael Jackson and Prince) found pop success, sometimes seeming to leave the genre behind. Was that really progress? 6. Black Noise by Tricia Rose This book, published in 1994, was one of the first academic investigations of hip-hop, although, like many of the books that came afterward, it was not entirely celebratory. Rose was devoted to hip-hop, but she was also devoted to the idea of hip-hop as a vehicle for resistance and emancipation, which means she can’t help but notice the ways in which it often failed to live up to these ideals. In describing (and sometimes decrying) the genre’s tendency to focus on “male predatory sexual behaviour”, and its existence within a network of white-owned, multinational businesses, she anticipated the way hip-hop would continue to delight and frustrate its biggest fans for decades to come.
7. Energy Flash by Simon Reynolds An enthusiastic and often contagious history of dance music, with a focus on pleasure: Reynolds conjures up not only how house and techno (and their many offshoots) evolved, but what it really feels like to love them. This feeling has not always been entirely organic: Reynolds pays close attention to the relationship between dance music and drugs, explaining how often, when the high changes, the beat changes, too. 8. Lords of Chaos by Michael Moynihan and Didrik Soderlind An intense, scary book about an intense, scary scene: black metal, which in the 1990s took heavy metal’s obsession with darkness and evil to its logical conclusion. Moynihan and Soderlind chronicle a world of murder, hatred and madness; even if you don’t have any interest in the bands (or in the 2018 Jonas Åkerlund film based on this book), you may come away with a new appreciation for what it means for music to be truly extreme. 9. Love Saves the Day by Tim Lawrence How do you capture a party? Often, you don’t: the revellers go home, the DJ packs up, people move on. But in this careful work of excavation, Lawrence shows how, in 1970s New York, casual get-togethers spawned glamorous nightclubs, and eventually an entire musical subculture, reconstructing the prehistory of disco, and gesturing toward all the sounds and scenes that came afterward.
10. Girls to the Front by Sara Marcus Riot grrrl was at least two things at once: a musical movement, which bloomed briefly in the 1990s, and a literary movement, sparked by fanzines, which jammed together punk rock and feminism, challenging and changing the identities of both of them. This book is an indispensable cultural history that emphasises both the strangeness and the sensibleness of riot grrrl, an unlikely movement that seems, in retrospect, inevitable.

218;218;5461;5461;On the right track: how walking connects me to the land and its people;2022-01-05T12:00:32Z;['Ashish Ghadiali'];['Walking', 'Hobbies', 'Life and style', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Travel', 'Fitness', 'Wildlife'];"From the age of eight, I attended a little boarding school on the Derbyshire-Staffordshire border where I’d often get in trouble on a Sunday afternoon. The teachers would leave us to roam the edge of the grounds where we were supposed to pass time making fires, toasting marshmallows or playing cricket but my habit was to set out over the fences and stiles into the landscape and often, much to the teachers’ chagrin, no one knew where to find me.
That was the point. To stand on unfamiliar ground and, for a moment, feel the world as something new brought with it a feeling I would crave and it formed a habit that stuck with me. By my mid-20s, I was a committed pedestrian, buoyed up by a privileged encounter on the streets of Whitechapel with east London’s resident visionary, Iain Sinclair, who warned against the underground as a way of getting around the city. He likened its subterranean networks to rabbit warrens that would cut us off from instinct and make it hard for us to know where (or who) we really are. Shuffling on fast feet between Aldgate East and Soho, or kicking back for a languorous Sunday stroll up to Parliament Hill, that was an insight I carried with me as I stumbled over Roman ruins and hidden histories of romantic poetry. Making sense of the city’s vast topography, walking became a way of life that, in turn, gave shape to an itinerant decade and I would ease myself into new locations the world over by setting out on foot to get lost and then find myself again in the backstreets of Ahmedabad or Isfhanan, Ramallah or Bari.
And then beyond the towns and cities and beyond the scale of human history, I’d walk in the foothills of the Himalayas or on the desert plains of the Jordan Valley and find new depths of experience. I’d watch the monsoon end in thick fog rising up the mountainside near Dharamsala or see the seasons laid out in space at the point where the fresh air of Ein-Al-Hilwe (“sweet natural spring”) presses up close against the heat and dust of Jericho. These were landscapes to fall in love in and I did, discovering while walking a feeling of transcendence that moved me beyond the narrow quadrant of my own identity-story, nurturing a feeling of connection with something deeper in myself, and with the person beside me, and with the planet that contains us. By the time I returned to England in my mid-30s, I had got used to looking at walking as a way to cultivate a feeling of belonging. Back in Derbyshire, clearing out the house I grew up in, I was taken in by a community of Kashmiri hikers, the Kramblers, who had been thinking along similar lines.
Home now in Rotherham, Sheffield, Salford, Oldham and Rochdale, each one of them was remembering a childhood in Mirpur where walking in the mountains had been an activity as natural as popping to the shop to pick up a pint of milk. Yet decades inhabiting an immigrant geography in northern England had turned them into dwellers of the cities and the suburbs – the “ghettoes” – cut off from the rugged rural landscapes that surrounded them. In response, and to reclaim something lost, they had begun to organise themselves, every Sunday, to get out together across the peaks and valleys of Edale, Dovedale, Malham, Monsal, Kinder Scout – to stand up to unconscious narratives about who belongs where and what land belongs to whom. They began to cultivate, by walking, a sense of belonging with the landscape of England that lies deeper than the surface layer of racist nationalism. And for me, walking with the Kramblers became a way of piecing together worlds torn apart by geopolitics.
That experience strengthened a sense of belonging that, by the time I established my own home, in the landscape of south Devon, I knew could be cultivated here, too – along the coastal paths and forest floors that surround the River Dart. Here, walking now serves me (and my one-year old puppy, Dharma) as an essential daily practice. The world outside our front door is a refuge from a day of successive Zoom calls or from the intensity of a writing deadline. It’s a place where I can get out of my head. Where he and I can remember where we are (and who we are), recover a sense of our equilibrium. We watch the seasons change and sense the movement of the sun and the light around the moon. We witness the earth and when I get home I make a cup of tea. The flowers of spring can feel just like a miracle. We walk the same path, day after day, but every minute of every hour can feel like new. How to do it The Ramblers Association has a tool for finding local walking groups and All The Elements is a volunteer-run library of organisations which help diverse communities enjoy the great outdoors. Gay Outdoor Club is another great resource for finding local LGBTQ+ groups and events to help you connect with people who want to run, hike and ramble. When it comes to finding new routes, National Trails can show you the way or look at the National Trust’s survey of Britain’s 100 Favourite Walks from 2018.

Though shellfish are a common ingredient, this soup is almost endlessly adaptable, even for vegans: as long as it vibrates with flavour – aromatic lime leaves and lemongrass, warming galangal and fresh citrus – you’re on the right track. Prep 12 min Cook 15 min Serves 4 16 raw shell-on king prawns 1 dash vegetable oil 4 fresh makrut lime leaves 2 lemongrass stalks 2 thick slices galangal 2 bird’s eyes chillies 1 tbsp palm sugar, or soft brown sugar Juice of 1½ limes 2 tbsp fish sauce 1 handful coriander or Thai basil leaves, to serve 1 A note on the prawns You’ll need raw, shell-on prawns here. Frozen are fine, so long as they’re defrosted and soft enough to shell, but if your prawns are very large (or very small), adjust the quantities accordingly. If you can find only shelled prawns, use a litre of light fish or chicken stock (or even just water), and start from step 3. 2 Make a stock with the prawn shells
Shell the prawns, retaining the shells and heads, and set aside the meat for the time being. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high flame, then fry the shells and heads, stirring regularly, until they turn a vivid pink. Add a litre of water, bring up to a lively simmer, then strain into a clean pan and discard the spent shells. 3 Prepare the aromatics
Roughly tear the lime leaves (avoid using the dried kind here: frozen are fine, though, but fresh are infinitely preferable and fairly widely available). Bruise the lemongrass by pressing down on it with the flat of a large knife, then cut it into roughly 5cm lengths. Cut two thick slices of galangal – this ginger-like root is sold in specialist south-east Asian food stores and some large supermarkets, but use ginger if you can’t source any. 4 Infuse the stock
Add the lime leaves, lemongrass and galangal to the stock pan, bring it back up to a simmer, then leave to bubble gently and infuse for five minutes. Meanwhile, finely slice the chillies, leaving the pith and seeds inside (depending on your taste for spice, add more, if you like). Slide the chillies into the broth and leave the stock to blip away for a couple of minutes longer. 5 Add the prawns
Turn down the heat to the barest simmer, add the prawn meat to the broth and cook for about a minute, until just pink (be careful not to let the stock boil or to cook the prawns for too long, or they will turn rubbery).
Take off the hob, stir in the sugar, lime juice and fish sauce, then taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. 6 Serve with lots of fresh herbs Ladle the soup into bowls, making sure the prawns are evenly divided, then tear in the fresh herbs in generous quantities and serve immediately. It’s not traditional, but you can bulk out the soup by adding some cooked rice noodles if you want to make it a more substantial dish, or add other vegetables such as chopped tomatoes, mushrooms or whatever else takes your fancy.
7 Alternatives to shellfish If you’re not a shellfish fan, make this with good chicken stock, and add torn cooked chicken (or pork or turkey) at the end, just to warm it through. There’s also a more modern, richer variation of tom yum in which coconut or evaporated milk is added at the end of cooking: if that appeals, make only 750ml stock, and stir in 300ml coconut milk with the seasonings just before serving. 8 … or to veganise To make this vegan, use vegetable stock or water, and add two round shallots, peeled and cut into wedges, along with the aromatics in step 3. Add two deseeded and roughly chopped tomatoes and 200g chopped oyster, shiitake and/or chestnut mushrooms with the chillies. Vegan versions of fish sauce are available, and I’d recommend getting hold of some for this dish. 9 Other flavourings Vegan or not, you can also add some firm diced tofu instead of the prawns; I think it’s also rather nice with those fried tofu puffs sold in specialist south-east Asian food shops. Pick up a jar of nam prik pao while you’re there: this rich, sweet chilli paste, also available in vegetarian form, is a great addition to tom yum, and a great many other dishes besides.";https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/05/how-to-make-tom-yum-thai-soup-recipe-felicity-cloake-masterclass;1
220;220;5463;5463;Preet Chandi becomes first woman of colour to ski solo to south pole;2022-01-05T11:56:49Z;['Jessica Murray'];['Antarctica', 'Exploration', 'Science', 'Derby'];"Preet Chandi, thought to be the first woman of colour to complete a solo crossing on Antarctica, has finished her expedition to the south pole almost a week ahead of schedule. Chandi or “Polar Preet”, endured temperatures of -50C as she skied 700 miles across Antarctica in 40 days, seven hours and three minutes, narrowly missing out on setting a new world record by a woman for the trek. She finished just behind the time set by Johanna Davidsson of Sweden, who finished in 38 days, 23 hours and five minutes in 2016. Chandi, 32, is now the third-fastest female solo skier for the expedition behind Davidsson and Britain’s Hannah McKeand, who recorded a time of 39 days, nine hours and 33 minutes in 2006. She is also the first person to reach the south pole on foot in two years. Chandi, a British Army physiotherapist who lives in Derby, said it was surreal to reach her goal: “I made it to the south pole where it’s snowing. I’m feeling so many emotions right now. I knew nothing about the polar world three years ago and it feels so surreal to finally be here. It was tough getting here and I want to thank everybody for their support. “This expedition was always about so much more than me. I want to encourage people to push their boundaries and to believe in themselves, and I want you to be able to do it without being labelled a rebel. “No matter where you are from or where your start line is, everybody starts somewhere.” As well as freezing temperatures, Chandi endured wind speeds of up to 60mph and battled whiteouts while pulling a 90kg sled across sastrugi, parallel wave-like ridges on the hard snow caused by winds. She also suffered from exhaustion towards the end of the journey, as well as a persistent cough and sickness. Setting off on 24 November from Hercules Inlet, Chandi aimed to complete her trek in 45 days, carrying enough rations for 48 days. In the end she finished five days ahead of schedule, covering a daily average distance of about 17 miles. She spent years training for the trek, having previously completed a 27-day expedition on the ice cap in Greenland and taking part in ultramarathons, including the gruelling Marathon des Sables across the Sahara. Chandi said she hoped her journey would inspire young people, women and those from minority-ethnic backgrounds. Speaking to the Guardian during her training for the trek, she said people did not expect an Asian woman to attempt such an endeavour. “I am an Asian woman; I’m not the image that people expect to see out there,” she said. “People say the outdoors is for everyone and yes, it is. But if you come from a community that is not involved in it at all, or you don’t see anybody that looks like you doing it, it can be really hard.” After completing the trek, she plans to set up an adventure grant to help more women fund expeditions in what is often a male-dominated arena. “I have been told ‘no’ on many occasions and to ‘just do the normal thing’, but we create our own normal,” she said. “You are capable of anything you want.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/preet-chandi-becomes-first-woman-of-colour-to-ski-solo-to-south-pole;6
221;221;5464;5464;Brighton sign record-breaking Poland midfielder Kacper Kozlowski;2022-01-05T11:49:26Z;['Guardian sport', 'Ben Fisher'];['Brighton & Hove Albion', 'Transfer window', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Brighton have signed the Poland midfielder Kacper Kozlowski, who last summer became the youngest player to play at a European Championship. The 18-year-old has joined from Pogon Szczecin for £8m on a contract to June 2026 but will go straight on loan to the Belgian club Royale Union St-Gilloise. Kozlowski made history when, aged 17 years and 246 days, he came on for Poland against Spain at Euro 2020, breaking a record set less than a week earlier by England’s Jude Bellingham.
“His style of play suits us and our style,” said Brighton’s manager, Graham Potter. “During my time here, we have done very well in recruiting players for the future and Kacper is a similar signing. “He will initially head out on loan, as it is important for him to continue his development, and he is keen to continue playing regularly. We will be watching with interest, as he is a very exciting young talent.” Kozlowski made his first-team debut for Pogon aged 15 years and 215 days as a last-minute substitute and has played six times for Poland. He was unable to train for almost six months from January 2020 after suffering injuries, including to his spine, in a car crash.
Bournemouth are set to beat off Premier League competition to sign Fleetwood Town’s James Hill. The England Under-20 defender, who was called up to the England Under-21 squad last year before having to withdraw through injury, attracted numerous bids in this window amid interest from elite clubs across Europe, with Barcelona sending a scout to watch the 19-year-old in November. But Bournemouth are poised to land the centre-back, whose father, Matt, played for Bristol City, Preston and Sheffield United. The fee will represent a Fleetwood club record, surpassing the £1.25m they received for Jamie Vardy in 2012. Hill will undergo a medical on Wednesday and is set to be joined at Bournemouth by the Manchester United full-back Ethan Laird, who excelled for Swansea during the first half of the season. Laird is expected to join on loan. Bournemouth allowed the experienced centre-back Steve Cook to join Nottingham Forest on Tuesday after a decade at the club.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/transfer-news-brighton-sign-poland-kacper-kozlowski;4

223;223;5466;5466;TechScape: Elizabeth Holmes is far from the only tech leader overpromising and underdelivering;2022-01-05T11:45:22Z;['Chris Stokel-Walker'];['Technology', 'Theranos', 'Silicon Valley', 'Facebook', 'Media', 'Social networking'];"It’s safe to say that it’s not a happy new year for Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos and – following a guilty verdict on four of 11 charges in a California court this week – a convicted fraudster. Holmes, you may remember, promised her devices could diagnose a plethora of health problems from a pinprick of your blood, gaining coverage from the media throughout the 2010s. We now know the technology Holmes hawked to investors, the media and the general public was seriously flawed.
Theranos was founded in 2003 and collapsed in 2018, following a Wall Street Journal report by John Carreyrou that highlighted issues with the company’s test results. In court, Holmes was acquitted on three charges connected to patients who received erroneous test results, but as the Guardian’s Kari Paul writes, the case “marks a milestone for Silicon Valley – an industry that has for years evaded accountability in its pervasive culture of ‘fake it till you make it’ that encourages founders to make big promises, often with little proof.” British entrepreneur and investor Vikas Shah describes Theranos as “a very expensive canary in a coalmine. For the last decade, we’ve seen investors pile money into [unproven] business time and time again.” Such investment begets a vicious circle, in which the press and public play their own roles. Big money raises for hot new companies are fundamentally more interesting to journalists than dull business developments. We cover them enthusiastically (Forbes called Holmes the “next Steve Jobs”), which allows those companies in turn to raise more cash. Some companies even get to the point of publicly listing with great fanfare, then flopping as the share price sinks – often on the day they launch. It’s a pattern that’s happened too many times to mention, yet we still fall for it. I’m also minded to think of Holmes’ business, and others like it, in light of the manifesto of a relaunched WIRED magazine, published this week by recently arrived editor Gideon Lichfield. WIRED, of course, was a techno-utopian booster when launched in 1993. It heralded tech’s excellence, and captured the spirit of its time: a Jetsons-like promise for the future of the world, carried on tech’s broad back. Since then, we’ve all gone through the looking-glass. I often say I’m a tech-sceptic tech reporter, because like many I’ve been jaded by successive scandals and endless “jam tomorrow” promises of the likes of Theranos. More generally, many of us have become ground down by tech’s promise to radically rewrite our future, only to find that it’s little more than a rebranding of the past imbalances, designed to supplant one controlling power with another. The liberation of the media from a small cabal of editors resulted in the torrent of fake news and the polarisation of our planet on the likes of Facebook. What was meant to be a decapitation of the old leaders and a replacement with a flatter hierarchy actually just entrenched the power of the old guard, and made social media companies more powerful. The promise of removing the gatekeepers in the old world of entertainment has done that to a certain extent, but has ended up making Alphabet, parent company of YouTube and one of the world’s richest firms, even richer – all while a phalanx of creators produce content for free. Even within the creator economy, the idea of a democratising force didn’t end up that way. 96.5% of YouTubers don’t make enough to break the US poverty line, according to one analysis, while TikTok disburses only around five per cent of its revenue to the people who produce its content. All of which is to say: don’t believe the hype. Tech companies overpromise and underdeliver. They’ve spent decades doing it. They’re continuing to do it. Yet Lichfield’s essay is an interesting one, because it discourages us from thinking simply of things as wholly positive or wholly negative. After years of yo-yoing from tech idealism to tech scepticism, we shouldn’t immediately discount the promise technology has to reinvent our lives. “We’re at what feels like an inflection point in the recent history of technology, when various binaries that have long been taken for granted are being called into question,” he writes. It’s worth looking at the Theranos story through that lens. Yes, the company appears to have exaggerated or invented many of its claims. But there are a range of tech-first companies actually doing miraculous things in the field of medicine and diagnostics. The fact we’re able to shoulder the burden of the omicron variant of coronavirus is largely down to the likes of techno-utopian companies BioNTech basically inventing new techniques to manufacture vaccines at a scale never before seen. Tech overpromises, and tech coverage often too readily repeats unlikely claims. But technology is still significant. For every tech bro trying to rebrand PDFs as “literature NFTs” (which has more than a hint of Uber rebranding the bus), there are people who are doing legitimately exciting things. “The exciting part is we are genuinely at a time when technology is doing incredible things,” says Shah. “It’s not about being anti-utopian, but it’s about asking sensible questions. Is something fair and reasonable?” Healthy scepticism is no bad thing, then. It’s what keeps the vast majority of society from buying into the so-far illusory promise of Web3, another gleaming vision of the tech-enabled future that promises to decentralise control, but so far as resulted in a handful of people getting filthy rich by selling cartoonish JPGs. It’s what protects you from the endless number of scams and thefts that are dominating the world of NFTs at present. For years we have too readily accepted what tech founders and leaders tell us without thinking: “Is this really realistic?” Now, we’re running the risk of slipping too far in the opposite direction. The new challenge is striking the balance between the two.

224;224;5467;5467;MoD has wasted £13bn since Tories came to power, Labour claims;2022-01-05T11:45:06Z;['Dan Sabbagh'];['Defence policy', 'Ministry of Defence', 'UK news', 'Military', 'Labour', 'John Healey', 'Conservatives', 'Ben Wallace', 'Politics'];Labour has accused the Ministry of Defence of wasting £13bn of taxpayers’ money since the Conservatives came to power on failed procurement projects, overspends and other administrative errors. The opposition published a 16-page dossier, which it said highlighted a string of examples of financial mismanagement, including £4bn of waste since 2019, the year the current defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was appointed. John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, accused ministers of having “no grip on the MoD’s finances” and said the scale of waste was “significant and systemic”. None of its 36 projects were rated green – “on time and in budget” – according to official Whitehall assessments, he added. The overspends were taken from MoD and other official documents, and some date back to flawed procurement decisions during Labour’s 13 years in government, which ended in 2010. Recent problems highlighted include: A £1bn overspend relating to the building of a new nuclear warhead manufacturing site at the state-owned Atomic Weapons Establishment in Burghfield near Reading. The National Audit Office, the government watchdog, warned in a 2020 report that the project was delayed by more than six years due to poor project management. Delays in the procurement of three additional Astute class nuclear-powered attack submarines, costing just over £1bn, which are intended to take the total fleet to seven by 2026. A cost of £595m incurred for no military benefit when the planned upgrade to the Warrior armoured vehicle, which was started in 2011, was scrapped in last spring’s defence review. By that stage, the programme, described as an “abject failure” by the Commons defence committee, was running seven years late. The MoD has faced repeated criticisms of its management of large contracts. MPs on the cross party public accounts committee said in November that the system of defence procurement was “broken” and they feared that overspends would eat up the £16.5bn extra in government money allocated last year. Current concerns centre on the introduction of the £5.5bn Ajax heavy armoured vehicle, which has been plagued by serious noise and vibration problems that its manufacturers are struggling to fix. Soldiers were put at risk of harm in testing, the defence procurement minister Jeremy Quin admitted last month. But problems with financial management at the MoD date back many years, including to Labour’s time in government. Delays and overspends during Labour’s time in office plagued the development of RAF Nimrod spy planes, cancelled by the Conservatives shortly after taking office in 2010. Waste on the programme is included in Labour’s dossier at a cost of £3.7bn, the largest single item identified. Also highlighted are £2.8bn of overspends relating to the development of the Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales aircraft carriers. The cost of building the Royal Navy’s biggest ever ships soared from an initial estimate of £3.9bn – when the project was commissioned under Labour in 2007 – to £6.4bn. Labour said it would commission the NAO to conduct an across-the-board audit of MoD waste, and make the department subject to a spending regime enforced by a newly created Office for Value for Money. “Reforming the department will not be easy, but this report takes a crucial first step,” Healey added. In response, the Ministry of Defence said it was “serious about investing in Defence modernisation” and said it was prepared to take “tough decisions to replace old equipment and halt programmes that no longer fit requirements” even if it meant writing off spending.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/05/mod-has-wasted-13bn-since-tories-came-to-power-labour-claims;1
225;225;5468;5468;Joe Biden needs to stand up and fight Manchin like our lives depend on it | Daniel Sherrell;2022-01-05T11:15:21Z;['Daniel Sherrell'];['Joe Biden', 'Joe Manchin', 'Democrats', 'US politics', 'US news', 'US domestic policy'];"A few days before Christmas, Joe Manchin appeared on Fox News to publicly retract his support for the Build Back Better Act. Even by the pathologically callous standards of Washington, it felt surreal to watch a politician jeopardize tens of millions of lives in a single 10-minute interview. But the stakes of his decision remain clear: without the act, the United States will fall far short of its climate goals, making a century of ecological collapse, economic devastation and civilizational upheaval not only more likely, but increasingly unavoidable. In the wake of the announcement, despair flickered across the internet. Friends called me in tears. My generation has watched our government fail again and again to enact meaningful federal climate legislation. But this latest betrayal is almost too much to bear. It feels like we are being forced to say goodbye: to our democracy, to our future, to the world we were told we’d inherit. If Build Back Better fails, Manchin may well be remembered as the man who killed the planet. Given the prospect of having to one day explain to his grandchildren why they can’t go outside in the summer, you think he’d at least attempt to marshal some plausible justifications. But his arguments collapse under the lightest scrutiny. His inflation fears have been thoroughly debunked, including by Larry Summers, the patron saint of inflation anxiety. His climate arguments are fundamentally unserious, anti-science propaganda copied straight from the big coal playbook. The most generous interpretation is that he’s a mulish egotist: a man who sticks to his guns, even when his guns are firing blanks. But the bulk of the evidence points to simple bad faith. Since joining the Senate, Manchin has personally grossed over $4.5m from coal companies he owns. In recent months he has received millions in campaign donations from Republican billionaires and fossil fuel executives who want to see Build Back Better die a slow, painful death. Meanwhile, he has ignored the pleas of West Virginia mothers, tuned out the counsel of his own pope and bulldozed the very coal miners he’s so often wielded as political props. In the light of day, his motives seem as obvious as they are depressing.
Regardless of his true endgame, Manchin’s reversal raises a pressing question: what exactly is Biden’s strategy? He’s already forfeited his most obvious piece of leverage, allowing the bipartisan infrastructure bill to move forward without any promise of reciprocation. His “charm offensive” – an exercise in Beltway nostalgia, if not outright political delusion – has run aground on the brutal logic of contemporary petro-politics. When it comes to his signature policy agenda, his administration seems flustered, reactive and naive. And yet, the bill must not be abandoned. Executive action alone probably can’t deliver the lasting emissions reductions that climate science demands. If the first Democratic trifecta since 2009 fails to produce ambitious climate legislation, both party and planet will suffer catastrophic consequences. So Biden needs a new strategy, and fast. There are two basic options. The first is to take off the kid gloves and start playing hardball. If he doesn’t have any leverage, then he needs to get some, especially if Manchin is acting in bad faith. That means channeling Lyndon B Johnson and pairing noble intent with sharp elbows. Threaten targeted federal regulations that would cripple Manchin’s benefactors in big coal. Use the bully pulpit to call them out by name: Michelle Bloodworth, Chris Hamilton, Joe Craft, Jim McGlothlin – all the special interests ready to sacrifice my generation on the altar of their quarterly returns. Have the justice department revisit allegations that Manchin’s daughter, former Mylan chief Heather Bresch, played a personal role in criminally inflating the price of life-saving EpiPens (as if corporate fealty and misanthropic greed were a sort of family tradition). Dare him to defect to the Republican party, where he’ll either kiss the ring of the autocrat he voted twice to impeach or be eaten alive as a Republican in Name Only, or Rino. The second option is to publicly accept Manchin’s private counteroffer, get it to the Senate floor for a vote, and then dare him to renege. The $1.8tn counter-offer – which reportedly included universal pre-K, an expansion of the Affordable Care Act and $500 to 600bn in clean energy incentives – would fall short of what working people need. But it would offer some crucial support, while keeping America’s climate commitments alive. There’s a chance Biden could still circumvent Manchin on extending the child tax credit, which would lift millions of American children out of poverty. No state has benefited from the popular policy more than Utah, and Mitt Romney has indicated a willingness to negotiate. Progressives could blanket his state in ads on child poverty while the administration buttonholes him on specifics. Whichever path the administration chooses, they need to abandon their fixation on “projecting normalcy”. We are not living in normal times, and every American knows it. With each new failure, their genteel posture reads less like a steady hand and more like a form of sleepwalking. It’s time they communicated candidly with the American public and made clear what is actually happening. Manchin’s intransigence is not an unfortunate product of normal democratic deliberation. It is a perverse and dangerous attempt on the part of fossil fuel oligarchs to prevent the demos from protecting itself against climate change. Republicans’ lockstep opposition to clean energy investments supported by almost two thirds of American voters is not the product of legitimate policy disagreement, but of a party actively and transparently opposed to majoritarian democracy. As the Biden presidency enters what could be the final act of a political tragedy, the only way out is to break the fourth wall. Sound the alarm and enlist the public. Expose the actors standing between young people and a livable future; between working families and a dignified living; and between all Americans and their right to representation. If Biden wants to win the war for democracy, then he must summon the courage to name it – loudly and repeatedly. Otherwise, his base will remain as we were after Manchin’s announcement: demobilized, despairing and deeply, justifiably cynical.

226;226;5469;5469;A year after the Capitol attack, what has the US actually learned? | Cas Mudde;2022-01-05T11:14:21Z;['Cas Mudde'];['US Capitol attack', 'US politics', 'Republicans', 'The far right', 'Joe Biden', 'Biden administration', 'Trump administration', 'World news', 'US news'];"One year ago, he was frantically barricading the doors to the House gallery to keep out the violent mob. Today, he calls the insurrection a “bold-faced lie” and likens the event to “a normal tourist visit”. The story of Andrew Clyde, who represents part of my – heavily gerrymandered – liberal college town in the House of Representatives, is the story of the Republican party in 2021. It shows a party that had the opportunity to break with the anti-democratic course under Donald Trump, but was too weak in ideology and leadership to do so, thereby presenting a fundamental threat to US democracy in 2022 and beyond.
Clyde is illustrative of another ongoing development, the slow but steady takeover of the Republican party by new, and often relatively young, Trump supporters. In 2015, when his massive gun store on the outskirts of town was still flying the old flag of Georgia, which includes the Confederate flag, he was a lone, open supporter of then-presidential candidate Trump, with several large pro-Trump and anti-“fake news” signs adorning his gun store. Five years later, Clyde was elected to the House of Representatives as part of a wave of Trump-supporting novices, mostly replacing Republicans who had supported President Trump more strategically than ideologically. With his 180-degree turn about the 6 January insurrection, Clyde is back in line with the majority of the Republican base, as a recent UMass poll shows. After initial shock, and broad condemnation, Republicans have embraced the people who stormed the Capitol last year, primarily referring to the event as a “protest” (80%) and to the insurrectionists as “protesters” (62%), while blaming the Democratic party (30%), the Capitol police (23%), and the inevitable antifa (20%) for what happened. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of Republicans (75%) believe the country should “move on” from 6 January, rather than learn from it. And although most don’t care either way, one-third of Republicans say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who refuses to denounce the insurrection. The increased anti-democratic threat of the Republican party can also be seen in the tidal wave of voting restrictions proposed and passed in 2021. The Brennan Center for Justice counted a stunning 440 bills “with provisions that restrict voting access” introduced across all but one of the 50 US states, the highest number since the Center started tracking them 10 years ago. A total of 34 such laws were passed in 19 different states last year, and 88 bills in nine states are being carried over to the 2022 legislative term. Worryingly, Trump-backed Republicans who claim the 2020 election was stolen are running for secretary of state in various places where Trump unsuccessfully challenged the results. At the same time, the situation of the non-Republican far right is a bit less clear. While some experts warn that the militia movement, in particular, has turned toward more violent extremism, the violent fringes of the far right are also confronted by a much more vigilant state. This is particularly true for groups linked to the 6 January attacks, such as the Oath Keepers, which has faced increasing public and state scrutiny after 21 of its members were alleged to have participated in the attacks. Similarly, Proud Boys leaders are facing trial over the event, and some have agreed to cooperate with authorities in their investigations. After decades of the US government ignoring or downplaying the threat of far-right violence, President Biden has made “domestic violent extremism” a key concern of his new administration, regularly singling out white supremacists as “the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland”. Partly in response to reports that former military personnel were prominently involved in the 6 January attack, the Pentagon has acknowledged “the threat from domestic extremists, particularly those who espouse white supremacist or white nationalist ideologies,” to the military and the country at large. This is not to say that the state is in control of the violent far right. While more than 700 suspected insurrectionists have been arrested, only some 50-plus have been convicted so far, mostly facing fines and probation, after judges rebuffed the DoJ. And media reports found that both the military and law enforcement have struggled to rid themselves of far-right ideas and supporters. But potentially violent far-right individuals and groups are now surveilled much more than they have been since 9/11 – we’re in a moment perhaps more similar to the short period after the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995, still the most deadly domestic terrorist attack in US history. In short, a year after the Capitol attack, US democracy is in a different but still fragile place. Most importantly, the extremists are no longer in the White House, encouraging and protecting the far-right mob. In fact, the state is more aware of and vigilant towards the far-right threat than ever before this century. The threat of far-right direct violence is probably less severe than before – not because the movement is weaker, but because the state is stronger. At the same time, the Republican party has become increasingly united and naked in its extremism, which denies both the anti-democratic character of the 6 January attack and the legitimacy of Biden’s presidency, and is passing an unprecedented number of voter restriction bills in preparation for the 2022 midterms and 2024 presidential elections. As long as the White House mainly focuses on fighting “domestic violent extremism”, and largely ignores or minimizes the much more lethal threat to US democracy posed by non-violent extremists, the US will continue to move closer and closer to an authoritarian future.

“I had a bit of a rough night but I managed to keep just enough energy for the day,” Wood revealed after stumps. “I had a bit of a stomach problem but I’m hoping that with a good night’s rest and some food inside me I’ll be right as rain. “I’m delighted to get Marnus because he’s a top player. I know we’ve had this ‘bowl fuller thing’ but I think we have to hit the wicket hard and make them play as much as we can. Thankfully I made Marnus play, it wasn’t an easy ball to leave, and he managed to edge it.” Despite illness and fatigue, Wood was typically happy to play along with the notion that his battle with Labuschagne could become a similar Ashes rivalry to that of David Warner and Stuart Broad after their earlier duel swung back to the Englishman when claiming the opener’s wicket for the 13th time in Test cricket. “I’d love to have a Broad v Warner thing with him,” Wood said. “Anybody would love that when they think they’ve got a chance to get someone out. The ball before, Marnus hit me for four so I just tried to zone in a bit more. I knew the ball before was loose but I got this one spot on. “You want to test yourself against the best players. I’ve been a bit frustrated in that I’ve felt in good rhythm and have been bowling well in this series without getting the wickets I would have liked but to get big players like that out makes you very happy.” Warner, who has previously had the better of Broad during their encounters on Australian soil and contributed to the current 3-0 scoreline with scores of 94 and 95, became the latest home player to express surprise that his old nemesis missed out on the seaming pitches in Brisbane and Melbourne.
“I really enjoy giving you guys a good story, which is fantastic and it builds up the game,” said Warner, reflecting on his earlier score of 30. “Me and Broady love it when we’re out there. It’s good fun, good funny banter. I tried to drive the ball too straight, that was my disappointment, but it’s awesome to see Broady back out there. “He’s a world-class bowler. Him and Jimmy Anderson bowling at us is great. Obviously, they would have been disappointed with some of these Test matches, not playing together, but that’s for their selection panel. It’s great to come up against the world’s best from England.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/mark-wood-ashes-breakthrough-cricket;3
228;228;5471;5471;Revisiting Greenville: the mountain town destroyed by California’s largest wildfire;2022-01-05T11:00:21Z;['Dani Anguiano'];['Wildfires', 'Climate crisis in the American west', 'California', 'US news', 'Climate crisis', 'Environment'];"At least once a week April Wielputz jogs down Main Street in Greenville, California, as she has for years. But now the exercise takes her past piles of charred brick and warped metal that once constituted the 19th-century-era buildings of the historic downtown. Sometimes, depending on her route, she runs by the still-standing but empty high school where her eldest son was supposed to start his senior year this fall. The blackened trees, crumpled buildings and even the cleared lots, are a reminder of the Gold Rush town’s staggering loss. On a Wednesday evening in August, this rural settlement of about 1,000 people found itself in the path of California’s largest single wildfire. Before it grew to nearly 1m acres and became the first known blaze to crest the Sierra Nevada, the Dixie fire destroyed Greenville in about 30 minutes, wiping away more than a century of history, displacing hundreds of residents and inflaming fears in a region already shaken by years of deadly fires. “I saw what happened in Paradise,” Wielputz said, referring to the town about 80 miles away lost to the 2018 Camp fire, which killed 85 people. “But I never, ever thought this would happen.”
The Dixie fire, sparked by a tree coming in to contact with a power line owned by the Pacific Gas & Electric utility, burned near the close-knit community of cattle ranchers and loggers for weeks before the flames suddenly grew, surprising firefighters. Unlike Paradise and Berry Creek, where the North Complex fire killed 14 in 2020, no one died in Greenville. But as the climate crisis fuels increasingly destructive and intense blazes in the west, the mountain town is yet another northern California casualty. Five months on, Greenville and those who call it home are fighting to navigate their changed worlds and rebuild their community.
Wielputz, who lost her home in the fire, is one of a few hundred people who have been able to return to the area – the majority of Greenville’s 1,100 residents are still displaced. She came back to Greenville as soon as officials allowed residents to return and bought a house, spared by the flames, on a hill overlooking downtown, just next to the home she lost. This town, with its sweeping mountain vistas, community spirit and soundtrack of passing trains, is home, she says, which is why she was eager to return, even with the rubble still piled up around town. “It’s still beautiful to me,” she said, pointing to the trees and the mountains. “Everyone’s like, ‘Oh my God, how are you handling it?’” she said while showing her mother the ruins of downtown. “It’s sad, but I’m gonna get used to it.” For some residents the sight of the destruction is still too painful. “It’s so depressing to drive through here, to see all the trees that are gone,” said Jerry Thrall, a 23-year resident whose home in Greenville survived.
Marilyn Crouch, 69, spent most of her life in Greenville; her parents graduated from the local high school, as did she and her husband, high school sweethearts, and later their children. Since the fire destroyed her home, Crouch and her husband have moved into a trailer outside her son’s house in nearby Quincy. She longs to return to the community she treasures, but it’s difficult to see the town in its current state and the other parts of the region badly damaged. Traveling to the valley for an appointment, Crouch and her husband were taken aback by the stumps of dead trees along the highway, part of a massive tree removal project. “That whole piece of highway is just destroyed. I cried all the way home,” she said. “I didn’t want to go home that way. Because I didn’t want to go through Greenville.” Actually navigating within the town can be difficult with all the familiar landmarks burned away. Greenville was so small and close-knit that many residents got around not by street names, but by houses and who lived there. “That’s how you’d tell someone how to get somewhere. You didn’t know the names of the streets, you’d tell them ‘where Dick Hamblin lives, three doors down’,” Crouch recalled.
But those houses are mostly gone. Cleanup is under way, though that process is expected to continue through January and much of the rubble still remains. While living in the area always came with challenges, it’s been particularly difficult since the fire. There was a housing shortage before, said Veronica Garcia, a spokesperson for Plumas Strong, a non-profit helping support residents after the fire, and now hundreds of people are still displaced. State and federal officials recently brought 14 trailers to the town to house fire survivors, but they’ll have to wait for longer-term solutions. Supply-chain shortages and inflation have made it difficult for local businesses and homeowners to start to rebuild, and for residents who have found housing to furnish their new homes. For those who have returned, cellphone reception and internet service are spottier than ever, residents say. Getting gas or mail requires a drive to Quincy, but the tree removal project along the highway has made a 30-minute journey into a sometimes two-hour trek. Though schools in Greenville survived, children are traveling to Quincy to attend classes. Sheriff deputies travel from nearby communities since the town’s substation burned down in the fire. “We’re facing the perfect storm of issues up here,” Garcia said. “There is a desperate need to have basic services back in this area.”
It will take time but Greenville will come back, Garcia insists. Community members and the Plumas Strong group are working on plans that they hope will restore the town to its former glory, while also making it a safer place to live. “We want to be the model for how to build in a high-risk area successfully,” said Garcia, who was raised in Greenville and returned to help out after the fire. “We’re optimistic that we can rebuild with intent but also get our community members back as quickly as possible.” *** Doing so is not without challenges. Insurers were reluctant to cover houses and businesses in the area before the fire due to the risk, and the community had long relied on increasingly diminishing jobs in the logging industry. “Greenville wasn’t exactly a thriving community beforehand but it was incredibly, incredibly close knit,” Garcia said. “Life is gonna be different for a while. The intention we have now is to put our heads together and think of creative solutions to all the problems rural small towns face.” Todd Johns, the local sheriff who was born in Greenville, said he tries to be hopeful about the town’s future, but that seeing the limited progress made in nearby towns can be discouraging. “I was pretty optimistic until I saw how Paradise looks and that kind of crushed my hopes and dreams. My in-laws lost their home in the Camp fire so I know what Paradise was and what it is.”
Those involved with the recovery efforts say they’re working with communities affected by the Camp fire and other blazes to see what lessons they can take from those disasters. Greenville was a deeply special place, both because of its stunning beauty and community spirit, residents say, and worth not just rebuilding, but building back better. “There’s this quality there and you can’t explain it,” said Sue Weber, the vice-chair of Plumas Strong. Weber, a former religious nun in Mother Teresa’s order, came for a three-month silent retreat and never left. “No matter who you are or what you hold, when the rubber meets the road, the community will gather around. I think that’s rare today.” While the future of the town is not yet clear, the close-knit nature that residents talk about appears intact. A Veterans Day parade attracted about 300 people to the streets of downtown. They lined up on sidewalks near the rubble to watch parade floats go by. A few weeks later hundreds headed to a Christmas lights parade in nearby Taylorsville, which was spared from the flames.
In Taylorsville, friends met for drinks, children cheered as passersby threw candy into the crowd and announcers paid tribute to the firefighters and community members who fought the flames, providing a moment of normalcy in an unprecedented year. Wielputz rode in the parade on her family’s float. Afterward, her family planned to put Christmas lights up around their new house and decorate for the holidays. It feels right to be back, she said.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/greenville-california-mountain-town-destroyed-dixie-fire;5
229;229;5472;5472;The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows by John Koenig review – fifty shades of sad;2022-01-05T11:00:21Z;['Steven Poole'];['Society books', 'Books', 'Science and nature books', 'Language', 'Culture'];"In 1983, Douglas Adams and John Lloyd published the classic satirical dictionary The Meaning of Liff, comprised of words for which there were no words yet. For instance: “Moffat, n., That part of a coat which is designed to be sat on by the person next to you on the bus”, or “Trispen, n., A form of intelligent grass. It grows a single, tough stalk and makes its home on lawns. When it sees the lawnmower coming it lies down and pops up again after it has gone by.” Novelty language books being an evergreen format, we are now offered The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows by John Koenig, the bound form of a long-running website, which is like a much more earnest and emo version of The Meaning of Liff. The presiding mood here is a lugubrious narcissism, signalled by defining various nuances of loneliness, anxiety, bittersweetness and things that are “poignant”. There is “haunting solitude” (“wildred”) or “complicated solitude” (“innity”). There are terms for microanalytical worries about one’s “quintessential self” or “inner self”. The star lexeme here, which the author fondly observes has entered some people’s online vocabulary since he proposed it some years ago, is “sonder”, defined as “the awareness that everyone around you is the main character of their own story”.
More enjoyable are the less gloomy, even jaunty coinages, such as “justing” (“the habit of telling yourself that just one tweak could solve all of your problems”), “proluctance” (“the paradoxical urge to avoid doing something you’ve been looking forward to … stretching out the bliss of anticipation as long as you can”), and “bye-over” (“the sheepish casual vibe between two people who’ve shared an emotional farewell but then unexpectedly have a little extra time together”). It’s at such moments that the book overlaps with The Meaning of Liff in that fertile space of the funny-serious. At times the author expands a definition into a mini-essay on, say, “the heartbreaking simplicity of ordinary things” (“maru mori”), and can risk ending up offering the kind of kitsch uplift that ought to be embroidered on cushions: “Perhaps we should try keeping our eyes open while we pray, and look for the meaning hidden in the things right in front of us.” But then, as a fusion of the genres of mindfulness and wellbeing with the browsable vocabulary book, it might just be a work of commercial genius. The benefit the author claims for his work is that readers might feel less alone by seeing strange feelings they have experienced set out in black and white, and so realise that they are part of the great warp and weft of humanity. Indeed, but fiction has long done this without needing to indulge a mania for neologism. The satisfied reader might still wonder, then, whether we really need new words with which to label such an exquisite Farrow & Ball range of emotional shades, or whether having a sufficiency of them would put a stop to the sentences of Proust, to literature itself. • Steven Poole’s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus.

230;230;5473;5473;Prince Andrew’s lawyers fight to dismiss Virginia Giuffre lawsuit | First Thing;2022-01-05T11:00:17Z;['Nicola Slawson'];['US news', 'World news'];"Good morning. Lawyers for Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre, who has long accused the royal of sexual abuse, finally faced off in Manhattan federal court yesterday, as he attempted to dismiss her civil lawsuit. The arguments via videoconference came a day after the unsealing of a 2009 settlement between Giuffre and the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew, who is not mentioned in the settlement, has contended that a clause in the settlement bars Giuffre from suing him. The judge, Lewis Kaplan, questioned lawyers for the prince closely over their claim that the settlement means Giuffre’s lawsuit should be dismissed. Giuffre, who accused Epstein and his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell of sexual abuse and forcing her into sex with Prince Andrew at age 17 – an accusation he vehemently denies – received $500,000 in her settlement with the late financier. Will the settlement agreement protect Prince Andrew? It’s too early to say but the judge did say, apparently speaking rhetorically: “The only people who could enforce it were Epstein and Giuffre.” When will the judge make a decision? Kaplan promised “a decision pretty soon”. Meanwhile, Prince Andrew is facing criticism for trying to use the clause to protect himself. More than 1,000 US public figures aided Trump’s effort to overturn election
More than 1,000 Americans in positions of public trust acted as accomplices in Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election result, participating in the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January or spreading the “big lie” that the vote count had been rigged. The startling figure underlines the extent to which Trump’s attempt to undermine the foundations of presidential legitimacy has metastasized across the US. Individuals who engaged in arguably the most serious attempt to subvert democracy since the civil war are now inveigling themselves into all levels of government, from Congress and state legislatures down to school boards and other local public bodies. The finding that 1,011 individuals in the public realm played a role in election subversion around the 2020 presidential race comes from a new pro-democracy initiative that will launch on Thursday on the anniversary of the Capitol assault. What is the Insurrection Index? It’s an initiative that seeks to identify all those who supported Trump in his attempt to hold on to power despite losing the election, in the hope that they can be held accountable. How will the anniversary of the 6 January attack be marked? Joe Biden will mark the first anniversary of the deadly assault at the US Capitol this Thursday by honoring the bravery of law enforcement and will “speak to the truth of what happened”. US law professor condemned for ‘white supremacist’ comments by own dean
The dean of the University of Pennsylvania’s law school has condemned one of his school’s own professors for making racist remarks about Asian people, saying that their recent comments were “xenophobic and white supremacist”. Prof Amy Wax, who specializes in social welfare law and labor and family economics law, appeared as a guest on the economist Glenn Loury’s podcast when she called the influx of “Asian elites” into the US problematic and made other racist statements, including a call for less immigration from Asian countries. In a scathing response, Dean Theodore Ruger acknowledged that while Wax’s comments were protected by freedom of speech and she held tenure at the college, they were “diametrically opposed to the policies and ethos of this institution”. What else did Ruger say about Wax’s comments? He said: “They serve as a persistent and tangible reminder that racism, sexism and xenophobia are not theoretical abstractions but are real and insidious beliefs in this country and in our building.” Will she keep her job? Despite the condemnation, Wax maintains her employment at the university. Ruger said Wax would be teaching only elective classes in future and would no longer teach required courses.

Don’t miss this: How to make 2022 the year you finally smash your goals
Many of us have mid- to long-term goals that are ambitious, but (in theory) achievable with the requisite investment of time and effort. Maybe for you, it’s running a marathon – or a 5k. It might be losing a particular amount of weight, or completing a course in yoga or a foreign language. It could be a time-intensive project such as making a quilt or researching your family history. How can we make it happen? Experts explain all. … or this: Could 2022 be sportswashing’s biggest year?
The year 2022 – which launches into the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing and ends with the World Cup in Qatar – is expected to be a great year for authoritarian regimes looking to cover up their atrocious human rights records. Over the course of a 12-month period, China, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, all of whom have been criticized for human rights violations, will use prestigious sports events to polish their public image on an international stage. Climate check: Californians could face $500 fines for wasting water under new rules
Californians will not be allowed to water their lawns for 48 hours after rainstorms or let their sprinklers run on to the sidewalk under new, mandatory water-saving rules that could result in a fine of up to $500 a day. The restrictions, adopted by state regulators yesterday, come as California continues to struggle under drought conditions, despite a recent wave of heavy rain and snow. Weather patterns in California have become more unpredictable due to the climate crisis and the state climatologist Michael Anderson said forecasts showed January, February and March could be drier than average.

231;231;5474;5474;Rocky road: Paraguay’s new Chaco highway threatens rare forest and last of the Ayoreo people;2022-01-05T10:30:21Z;['Laurence Blair'];['Global development', 'Conservation and indigenous people', 'Paraguay', 'Indigenous peoples', 'Americas', 'Conservation', 'Environment', 'World news', 'Deforestation', 'Endangered habitats', 'Trees and forests', 'Wildlife', 'Brazil', 'Infrastructure', 'Business', 'Road transport'];"In 1972, Catholic missionaries entered the Chaco forest of northern Paraguay and forced Oscar Pisoraja’s family, and their nomadic Ayoreo people, to leave with them. Many perished from thirst on the long march south. Settled near the village of Carmelo Peralta on the Paraguay River, dozens more died from illnesses. Still, the survivors kept up some traditions – hunting for armadillos; weaving satchels from the spiky caraguatá plant. “We felt part of this place,” says Pisoraja, now 51. Today, his community – and other indigenous peoples across the Chaco, a tapestry of swamp, savanna and thorny forest across four countries that is South America’s largest ecosystem after the Amazon – are confronting a dramatic new change. On 13 December, Paraguay’s president, Mario Abdo Benítez, visited Carmelo Peralta to launch construction work on a $103m (£76m) bridge that will cross the Paraguay River to Brazil. On the Paraguayan side, the bridge joins a $445m highway – already half-finished – carving a strip of asphalt for 340 miles (550km) east to west through the Chaco.
Mario Abdo Benítez, Paraguay’s president, and Reinaldo Azambuja Silva, governor of Mato Grosso do Sul state in Brazil, at the site of a new bridge across the Paraguay River, due to be completed in 2024 In 2024, when both are completed, the massive infrastructure project across the Chaco, the Bioceanic Corridor, will connect cattle ranchers and soya-bean farmers in Brazil and Paraguay with their lucrative Asian markets, via northern Argentina and Chile. Space is also being left for a parallel freight railway.
“This is a historic day for our country,” said Abdo Benítez, likening the highway to a new Panama Canal. “We’re going to integrate our two peoples,” Reinaldo Azambuja Silva, governor of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, told the ceremony in Carmelo Peralta. “This is the realisation of a dream.” But campaigners say the Bioceanic Corridor is a nightmare, accelerating destruction of the Chaco – the fastest-vanishing forest on Earth – and piling deadly pressure on its native inhabitants, including some who shun the outside world. In 2019, an area of forest the size of a football pitch was destroyed in Paraguay’s Chaco every two minutes.
Smoke hovers over a field in Luque, Paraguay, last August. Such fires are usually started by ranchers to clear land for pasture. Photograph: Jorge Sáenz/AP “It’s the final nail in the coffin for the Chaco and all its peoples,” says Miguel Lovera, director of Iniciativa Amotocodie, a Paraguayan conservation organisation. Paraguay’s Chaco is home to more than a dozen indigenous peoples. But the Ayoreo are particularly exposed to the changes brought by the highway: many live along its path, and already face severe poverty and social marginalisation. Leaders from the 11 Ayoreo communities near Carmelo Peralta say the highway poses many threats: from deadly road accidents and rapid social changes to increased illegal deforestation of traditional hunting and foraging grounds. Yet they felt forced to approve the project, says Juan de la Cruz, an Ayoreo local government official. “Even if we said no, they would still build it,” he says. The new road makes travelling to hospitals easier, its supporters say. Until roadworks began in 2019, the surrounding Alto Paraguay region – an area the size of Austria – had no asphalt road. Buses sometimes get stuck for weeks along muddy tracks, with stranded passengers having to be airlifted to safety.
An unfinished stretch of the Bioceanic Corridor between Carmelo Peralta and Loma Plata. The Paraguay government says half of the 340-mile highway will be finished this month But the highway is already killing indigenous people, according to locals. Recent traffic accidents and drownings in roadside drainage pools killed several of their community, including three Ayoreo girls, they say. Local consultations with indigenous communities were rushed, argues Lovera. Dozens of lorries carrying quarried material for the highway are now hurtling through Ayoreo land every day, he says. “They’ve never seen this kind of traffic before. They were duped,” Lovera adds. A host of damaging cultural upheavals are likely to follow. Leaders fear the coming tide of passing truckers and ranchers will spread drug use, prostitution and petty crime. These effects have already been seen elsewhere in the Chaco among other indigenous communities since the building of the 480-mile north-south Trans-Chaco highway in the 1970s, which Paraguay is also widening and resurfacing. “The building of a highway always brings negative things with it,” Pisoraja reflects.

More endangered animals will be flattened by speeding lorries, including slow-moving giant anteaters and the aguará guazú – a wolf-like canine. Wildlife tunnels under the road “mitigate the problem but not entirely, and there aren’t enough of them”, says Luis Recalde, a conservationist. Illegal hunting on Ayoreo territory has also intensified, says Enrique Pebi, president of the Union of Native Ayoreo of Paraguay. He contrasts the mass slaughter of giant armadillos, marsh deer, peccaries and jaguars by outsiders with the Ayoreo’s traditional consumption of some animals for subsistence. “They just use them for target practice,” he laments.
Tapir bones in the undergrowth near Fortín Isla Po’i, a former base for Paraguayan troops during their 1932-35 war with Bolivia over possession of the Chaco. Locals say some outsiders shoot at animals for target practice Most concerning, locals say, is evidence that the highway is speeding up deforestation. This makes it even harder for the Ayoreo to hunt, forage for honey, fruit and roots, and gather medicinal plants; practices that are key to their survival and culture.
Ayoreo villages near Carmelo Peralta accepted fishing boats and tractors in exchange for allowing a 30-mile road through their territory, says Pebi. “The things they’ve given us will wear out in five or six years,” he says. “I don’t know how many hectares we’ve lost for ever.” Meanwhile, amid a local property rush, Brazilian ranchers have bulldozed a track into Ayoreo land further along the Bioceanic Corridor, and started felling trees, leaders say, showing photos of clearances to the Guardian. The Ayoreo are now too afraid of being shot by foreign “invaders” – armed security guards on expanding nearby ranches – to forage alone, says Pebi. “We want to keep it as it is, our reserve,” he adds. “To go hunting, to get honey, to get homemade remedies. Everything’s there. We always say: it’s our only market.”
A digger stands along an unsurfaced section of Paraguay’s Bioceanic Corridor. Until 2019, the remote region – which is the size of Austria – had no asphalt road More than 140,000 sq km (54,000 square miles), a fifth of the entire Chaco, has been felled since 1985. This accelerating deforestation has global consequences. The Chaco holds 14 times more carbon-dense biomass than previously thought, one recent study found. Smoke-blackened palms line the highway – testament to the uncontrolled, man-made blazes to clear land for cattle that have swept the Chaco. Unlike the “fishbone” pattern of deforestation along highways in the Amazon, deforestation in the Chaco clears huge rectangles, Nasa observed. Greater deforestation spurred by the new highway also threatens about 150 Ayoreo, in at least 10 small groups, living in voluntary isolation in the Chaco’s forests, say the leaders of settled Ayoreo communities. Excluding the Amazon, they are the only documented indigenous people in the Americas seeking to avoid contact with modern society. For 60 miles, the highway passes near the Patrimonio Natural y Cultural Ayoreo Totobiegosode (PNCAT), a 5,500 sq km Ayoreo refuge. Reports sometimes circulate that Ayoreo people choosing to live in isolation have been killed by interlopers, but are difficult to officially confirm because Paraguay’s authorities do not monitor their numbers, location or wellbeing, says Lovera.
A lake at Fortín Isla Po’i. Severe drought struck the Chaco for several months in 2021. In September, the Paraguay River, which runs east of the Chaco, reached its lowest level since records began in 1904 A 2020 Earthsight report found that Brazilian ranching firms were illegally deforesting chunks of the PNCAT reserve and that leather sourced from the area has been used in luxury cars made by European companies such as BMW. Earthsight also singled out a supplier of the Chortitzer Cooperative – a huge cattle, grains and dairy company owned by the Mennonite community of Loma Plata, where the Bioceanic Corridor’s first stage ends. Florian Reimer, Chortitzer’s manager, told the Guardian that its associate had obtained environmental permits to raze parts of the forest. “We’re totally against illegal deforestation,” he insisted. Loma Plata – and the nearby Mennonite colony of Filadelfia – offer a vision of what the rest of the Chaco may soon look like. An orderly grid of roads encloses thin lines of trees. Indigenous peoples, uprooted by deforestation and forced conversion elsewhere in the Chaco, live marginal existences on the outskirts of town.
Clockwise from top left: Enxet and Ayoreo workers at the Santa María estate, which covers about 400 sq km of the Chaco. In 2014, the hacienda was investigated for alleged human rights abuses against the indigenous community; the dairy factory at the Mennonite-owned Chortitzer Cooperative in Loma Plata; a Paraguayan soldier picks his way through trees near Fortín Isla Po’i; animal hides dry on the Santa Elisa ranch, which is on land belonging to the indigenous Enxet community of Sawhotamaxa Enlhet-speaking men, formerly far-ranging nomads, cluster on street corners waiting for a day’s labour. The women often engage in sex work. This carries no stigma in traditional Ayoreo culture, but violent assaults and murders of Ayoreo women by non-indigenous men have increased in recent years. Chortitzer spends about $1.5m every year on health and educational projects benefiting about 3,500 local families, says Patrick Friesen, Chortitzer’s communications manager.. “Our objective is to try to live together.” “When I started here in ’75, all this was forest,” says Augustino Lovero, an Enlhet employee of Chortitzer’s dairy plant. “The image of the Chaco is going to change. The asphalt will bring many people, with their factories.” In Ayoreo settlements near Loma Plata, leaders were also sceptical of the highway’s promised benefits. Basui Picanerei says his village of Ebetogue still lacks reliable drinking water and land titles.

Lovera urges Paraguay to give indigenous communities land far from the road’s impact zone – or risk “genocide, willing or unwilling”. A Paraguay public works ministry spokesperson says the road project was diverted south to avoid several Ayoreo villages and the proposed bridge at Carmelo Peralta re-routed three kilometres north to avoid Ayoreo land. Near Loma Plata, the Bioceanic Corridor links with the Trans-Chaco highway, and will plunge deeper into the western Chaco in 2022. “The Chaco connects us to the world,” a billboard proclaims. The new highway “connects all the sufferings of many, and the good of a few, the businessmen,” counters De la Cruz, the Ayoreo leader from Carmelo Peralta. “And us, we’ll be left at the roadside watching them pass by.”

232;232;5475;5475;Craig Ruddy, Archibald prize-winning painter, dies at 53 from Covid complications;2022-01-05T10:20:04Z;['N/A'];['Art', 'Painting', 'Australia news', 'Art and design', 'Indigenous Australians', 'Culture', 'Byron Bay', 'New South Wales', 'Coronavirus'];"The Archibald prize-winning Australian artist Craig Ruddy has died aged 53 as a result of Covid complications. Ruddy, who was based in the New South Wales northern rivers region, won Australia’s most celebrated portrait prize in 2004 for his painting of David Gulpilil, titled Two Worlds. He also won the Archibald people’s choice prize that year, and again in 2010, for his portrait of Warwick Thornton. He was an Archibald finalist in 2011 and 2020, for his portraits of Cathy Freeman and Bruce Pascoe, respectively. Ruddy’s death on Tuesday night was announced on social media on Wednesday in a post that also paid tribute to his partner of two decades, Roberto Meza Mont. “It is with the heaviest of tender hearts we let you know that last night Craig left his body peacefully at home in Roberto’s arms,” the post on Ruddy’s accounts said. “We have lost the most divine human that gave so much to our communities, the creativity, the inspiration, the pure love and plenty of dance.”
In a recent profile in the Northern Rivers Review, the pair were described as a “powerhouse couple”, renowned in the region for their community input. In the piece, Ruddy spoke of the rare lung condition he was diagnosed with as a child. “It slowed me down and put me into a strange euphoric state,” he said. “As a result, I learned to sit and observe.” Ruddy’s 2004 Archibald-winning Gulpilil portrait made headlines when another artist, Tony Johansen, took legal action against the Art Gallery of NSW, which administers the prize. Johansen’s claim, which was dismissed by the NSW supreme court, was that Ruddy used mostly charcoal for the work, making it a drawing, not a painting. Ruddy was devastated by the death of Gulpilil just over a month ago. The artist and the Yolŋu actor developed a strong bond in 2004 when Ruddy drew him for Two Worlds. Ruddy drew Gulpilil at the Colo River while the actor took a break from rehearsals for his one-man show, directed by Neil Armfield. Ruddy only had a couple of hours to create the portrait, which he drew on colonial wallpaper. After Gulpilil’s death from lung cancer in November last year, Ruddy posted a picture to social media of him creating the portrait, writing: “This is how I’ll always remember you, strong, resilient and cheeky. My heart is heavy knowing you’ve left this world but your legendary spirit will live on forever.”
The last time Ruddy painted Gulpilil was in 2019, the day after the opening of Molly Reynolds’ documentary My Name is Gulpilil. Last month the portrait, I’m Gulpilil, was displayed at the David Roche Foundation in Adelaide. In December, Ruddy completed his last body of work, titled 2021, which Daniel Browning, host of Radio National’s The Art Show, said “puts me in mind of the dystopias conjured by the Spanish painter Goya”. Created in the studio adjoining his home in the Byron Bay hinterland, Ruddy said of the works: “These past two years have been a rollercoaster of emotions and feelings for all of us, including myself … Creating in my studio has helped me to maintain balance and perspective. We are definitely living in unprecedented times and the arts and deep human connection are paramount.”
Ruddy was born in Forestville, Sydney in 1968 and studied design and fashion illustration in the 1980s. In 2001 he quit his design career to become a painter, and over the past two decades divided his time between homes in Tamarama in Sydney’s east, the Byron Bay hinterland and Buenos Aires. On his website, his work is described as exploring “questions of social conscience as well as current environmental issues. The recognition of Australian Indigenous people and culture is also a core theme.”
When he wasn’t in his studio painting or travelling with his partner, he enjoyed invigorating cold outdoor baths, yoga, dancing, tending to his veggie patch, swimming, cooking and entertaining. Byron Shire Council mayor Michael Lyon said Ruddy was a “well-known locally based artist and Archibald prize-winner” who had “died as a result of complications from Covid-19”. “Devastated at the loss of my good friend and neighbour. Too young to leave us and such a beautiful, kind and generous soul, am still in complete shock,” Lyon said in a statement. The Yuin, Bunurong and Tasmanian author Bruce Pascoe also paid tribute to Ruddy, who painted him for the 2020 Archibald prize – the artist’s fifth submission to the portrait prize. “There goes a really decent and gentle soul,” Pascoe said in a statement. “The world needs the goodness of his spirit replaced. Teach your children well.” In a tweet marking Ruddy’s death, former Olympic athlete Cathy Freeman wrote: “Forever in my heart / Forever in my mind / Forever in my life.”
In a statement posted to Twitter, Ben Franklin, the NSW minister for Aboriginal affairs, the arts and regional youth, wrote: “A life so well lived, but taken far too soon. Craig Ruddy was an extraordinary artist. And a wonderful human being.”";https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/05/craig-ruddy-archibald-prize-winning-painter-dies-at-53;5
233;233;5476;5476;Keir Starmer to miss PMQs after testing positive for Covid again;2022-01-05T10:14:58Z;['Aubrey Allegretti'];['Keir Starmer', 'PMQs', 'Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'Politics'];"Keir Starmer will miss the chance to challenge Boris Johnson at the first prime minister’s questions of 2022, after the Labour leader tested positive for Covid. He will self-isolate and his deputy, Angela Rayner, will stand in at the dispatch box instead at 3pm. Starmer has been doing daily lateral flow tests and on Wednesday the result came back positive. It is his sixth period of self-isolation since the pandemic began. He last tested positive in October, forcing him to miss PMQs and the chance to respond to the budget.
Fresh from giving a new year’s speech in central Birmingham setting out Labour’s strategy for 2022, Starmer will have been keen to keep pressure up on the government given the Conservatives’ waning poll ratings after a damaging series of sleaze scandals. On Tuesday, he said alleged rule-breaking including at Christmas parties across Whitehall during December 2020 meant ministers had lost “the moral right to set those rules”. The speech was attended by about two dozen people, including several local Labour MPs sat socially distanced in the audience. Starmer is believed to have visited nearby constituencies afterwards. Before Starmer’s last positive test three months ago, he was also forced to isolate in July 2021 after one of his children tested positive, and in January 2021 after being identified as a “close contact” of someone who caught the virus. He also went into isolation in December 2020 when a staff member in his private office contracted Covid, and September 2020 while someone in his household had symptoms and awaited a test result. NHS guidance says anyone who catches Covid should notify all those with whom they have been in close contact in the past 48 hours – but those people do not need to isolate unless contacted by test and trace or they develop symptoms. Cases of the virus in Britain have rocketed in recent weeks as the Omicron variant, which scientists say is more transmissible, spread through the country. The highest daily number of new infections in the UK was reported on Tuesday, when 218,724 people tested positive for Covid. Johnson has resisted imposing further restrictions in England, putting the nation out of step with leaders of the devolved administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The prime minister has himself been forced to self-isolate before, but tried to avoid doing so in July 2021 after he and chancellor, Rishi Sunak, came into close contact with the health secretary, Sajid Javid, who later tested positive for Covid. Johnson and Sunak initially said they were part of a pilot testing scheme allowing them to avoid isolating, but U-turned after an outcry from members of the public and backbench Conservative MPs.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/05/keir-starmer-to-miss-pmqs-after-testing-positive-for-covid-again;1
234;234;5477;5477;Gal Gadot: Imagine video at start of pandemic was ‘in poor taste’;2022-01-05T10:05:56Z;['Catherine Shoard'];['Film', 'Culture', 'Gal Gadot', 'John Lennon', 'Coronavirus', 'World news', 'Music'];"Gal Gadot has sought to explain the thinking behind her widely ridiculed cover of the John Lennon song Imagine, posted to Instagram at the start of the pandemic. The video, which featured Gadot along with stars including Kristen Wiig, Natalie Portman, Will Ferrell, Zoë Kravitz and Jamie Dornan each singing a line from the song, was intended as a statement of solidarity.
“We are in this together, we will get through it together,” Gadot captioned the original post from March 2020, but many criticised the project as tone deaf, highlighting the apparent disconnect between lyrics such as “imagine no possessions” warbled from multimillion dollar mansions while hundreds of thousands lost their lives, relatives, jobs and homes.
Speaking to InStyle magazine, Gadot said that the timing of video – now viewed more than 10m times – was the central problem. “The pandemic was in Europe and Israel before it came [to the US] in the same way. “I was seeing where everything was headed. But [the video] was premature. It wasn’t the right timing, and it wasn’t the right thing. It was in poor taste. “All pure intentions, but sometimes you don’t hit the bullseye.” At the time of posting, Gadot had been in isolation for almost a week, she said, and watching the crisis unfold had left her feeling “philosophical”. Speaking to Vanity Fair last year, Gadot was unapologetic about the video, calling it “just not the right good deed. I had nothing but good intentions and it came from the best place, and I just wanted to send light and love to the world. “I can only say that I meant to do something good and pure, and it didn’t transcend.”";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/gal-gadot-imagine-video;5
235;235;5478;5478;Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched: A History of Folk Horror review – casts a spell ;2022-01-05T10:00:38Z;['Leslie Felperin'];['Film', 'Documentary films', 'Horror films', 'Film criticism', 'Culture'];"At three-and-a-bit hours long, this is worth every geeky minute if you’re into the genre of the title – think Witchfinder General all the way through to Midsommar. With its really smart deep dives into cultural criticism, this is a seasonal stocking overflowing with spooky fun. Writer-director Kier-La Janisse, founder of the Miskatonic Institute of Horror Studies, clearly knows the subject inside out, and finds the best authors, scholars and authorities to talk about the subject. But what’s really admirable is the way it is organised into digestible chapters that flow silkily from one subject to another, eased along by a spontaneous and colloquial voiceover from the director herself. As a film essay, the methodology is exemplary; if you want an education in an aspect of film over the winter and have finished watching all of Mark Cousins’ Story of Film docs, this offers an excellent next component. Arguably there may be a little overload, as Janisse and co get so engrossed in tracing the roots and shoots of the term “folk horror” across film, TV, literature and even theatre, that by the end it’s hard to remember what the genre’s defining characteristics are supposed to be. But ultimately you’ll know it when you see it: in film terms, it has to do with stories in rural settings where ancient skills, beliefs or practices rub up against a newer form of civilisation. Think of the pagan islanders with their maypoles and sacrifices in conflict with the austere Christian policeman in The Wicker Man, or the witchcraft practices involving animal transformations and blood meeting the prim 17th-century pilgrims in The Witch, directed by Robert Eggers (interviewed here).
These are just two of the obvious touchstones. Janisse includes clips from hundreds of much less well-known movies, many from the UK, which might be considered the spiritual homeland of folk horror, but spreading out to include gems from Australia, Indonesia, Mexico and Iceland. The discussion of the trope of Indigenous burial grounds in American folk horror is especially fascinating, for example, particularly to see how contemporary Americans struggle to cope with their colonial past (see Pet Sematary) as well as attitudes towards death and grieving (Midsommar). Pro tip: keep a notebook handy – there will be loads of titles you’ll want to look up afterwards. • Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched: A History of Folk Horror is available on 10 January on Shudder.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/woodlands-dark-and-days-bewitched-a-history-of-folk-horror-review;5
236;236;5479;5479;‘I felt powerless – so I started filming’: CyclingMikey on his one-man battle with dangerous drivers;2022-01-05T10:00:38Z;['Peter Walker'];['Cycling', 'Road transport', 'UK news', 'London', 'Life and style', 'Motoring', 'Society', 'Road safety', 'Social media', 'YouTube'];"As we chat, Mike van Erp keeps glancing at the line of vehicles queueing on the road in Hyde Park, London. Suddenly, he spots something. “Here we go,” he says, swinging around his sensible-looking blue touring bike, and pedalling away from the traffic lights. He edges along the stationary vehicles until he is parallel to a car. It is well over a minute before the driver looks up and spots him – and the camera strapped to his baseball cap. When he returns, a grinning Van Erp tells me the man reacted badly to the realisation he was being caught on camera. Why the fury? The driver was using his phone as he waited for the traffic to move – and Van Erp recorded him doing it. In the coming months the man will most likely face a fine and six points on his driving licence, in turn triggering a significant jump in his insurance premium.
Van Erp, a 49-year-old professional carer, says he has now reported close to 1,000 law-breaking drivers to the police, with about 80% facing prosecution. After any court proceedings are finished, he posts the footage on his YouTube channel. There have been some famous faces among the drivers he has reported. In early December, Van Erp allegedly filmed Frank Lampard using a phone while driving – the former footballer has denied the offence. Footage shot by Van Erp, however, has resulted in court action against ex-boxer Chris Eubank and Guy Ritchie, with the film director banned from driving. All of this has led to headlines, occasional TV appearances and made him the semi-reluctant public face of a new era of road crime enforcement, one in which police forces are being encouraged to accept online complaints about offences, backed up by video footage. Many of the complaints come from cyclists, who view such footage as one of the few ways they can push back against endemic levels of dangerous driving. It can be a controversial area. Van Erp regularly features in news articles as a “vigilante cyclist”, a description he dislikes intensely and which he has, on occasion, managed to have altered after complaining.
Van Erp’s 65,000 subscribers to his CyclingMikey YouTube channel have been enough to earn him a modest extra income as a result of his actions. Yet, he says, far from selecting prominent targets, he did not recognise any of the celebrities when he approached them. (The footage of him challenging Eubank for holding a phone at the wheel of his convertible Rolls-Royce sees him ask the clearly unimpressed former world champion, “Are you famous?”). And, he insists, a media profile was never his aim. His motivation is much simpler: trying to make the roads safer, one driver at a time. A Dutch national, who grew up in Zimbabwe and moved to the UK in 1998 to work in IT, he has a particularly personal stake in this. When he was still living in Zimbabwe, his father was killed by a drunk driver while riding his motorbike. Van Erp, then 19, was called by a local shopkeeper about the crash, and went straight to a suburb of Harare, where they lived, to find the mangled wreck of the motorbike and his father’s body covered by a blanket. “It was his birthday on the day, and in the morning I’d begged him to come gliding with me,” Van Erp recalls. “I had a pretty awesome upbringing and was close to my dad. He taught me to ride a bike, to fix punctures, to ride a motorcycle, and to drive a car.” It’s this memory, he says, that “really gives me that extra ounce of determination to cope with the hassle of admin of reporting drivers – I don’t like admin very much.” There is, he adds, a wider motivation: “I just like to think that with the power of one I’m trying to change a little bit of road safety. Most people who cycle realise that bad driving is largely tolerated by society. It’s not considered a really serious thing. Yet it’s claiming 1,800 people’s lives a year in the UK alone, and 27,000 are seriously injured. That’s a quite serious toll, isn’t it?”
It is not only a serious toll, but one that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable road users. While the UK has better overall road casualty statistics than most nations, the risk of injury or death per mile is 25 times greater for cyclists than for than those travelling in cars. The UK is also one of the few European countries where fatalities among pedestrians have risen in recent years. The sort of law-breaking captured by Van Erp and his fellow camera cyclists undoubtedly plays a part. On 20mph-maximum roads, an average of 86% of drivers break the speed limit. And to understand the sheer extent of motorists using handheld phones while at the wheel, you only need to watch Van Erp at work. He began taking his on-the-road shots in 2006, using an early bike-mounted camera. “I started filming because I felt a little powerless,” he recalls. “I couldn’t do anything if a bad driver gave me a close pass, or risked my life in some way. On the various cycling forums we started talking about cameras, how they were miniaturising and getting better – even though they’re terrible compared with now.” Initially, police forces had very little interest in following up his footage even of the most dangerous incidents. Yet, very gradually this has changed – Van Erp’s first successful prosecution followed an incident in 2018 when a taxi driver overtook him very closely. Today, many forces allow footage and complaint details to be uploaded via the web, making it easier – and possibly more likely – that cyclists and other road users with dashcams will bother reporting bad driving. The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) recently recommended that all forces in England and Wales set up such systems, a move instigated by DCS Andy Cox, the NPCC’s lead on traffic casualties and a pioneer in efforts to tackle them. But the ease of reporting road offences online for citizen volunteers such as Van Erp – who provide many more eyes on the road than would be possible for even the best-resourced police force – remains notably patchy. Camera users in Scotland, for instance, are still obliged to put their footage on to a DVD. Many people also complain that by submitting video they are treated only as witnesses, not potential victims, and so are not kept up to date about action taken. Statistics are limited on this new era of road crime enforcement. The Metropolitan police, the UK’s biggest police force, for example, says it does not keep any relevant figures. But freedom of information requests have revealed that several smaller forces now get hundreds of video complaints a year each, and as many as half lead to action. Van Erp says he has been told “sometimes half of driver awareness courses are filled with people caught by camera cyclists”. He became more diligent in his recording of road offences when he began seeing the results. “I started realising that real prosecutions were happening. And I thought, do you know what, it’s worth doing more than what just affects me, because that will help other people. You hope it will improve other people’s safety.” An hour with Van Erp in Hyde Park brings too many phone users for him to report. Yet, he says, while he is organised about backing up video files and cataloguing complaints and number plates, not least to identify what he calls “repeat customers” (his record is three – the driver of a red Porsche), he does not go out looking for phone-using drivers. He encounters enough of them during his usual cycle journeys – and official statistics illuminate how this happens. In the past four years, according to DVLA statistics, more than 90,000 British drivers have been caught driving while distracted, with 932 convicted at least twice, and one motorist punished nine times. Van Erp says he has to be mindful of how common phone use at the wheel is: “I don’t want this to consume my life. I have hobbies, and I have family. I limit how much time I spend on this.”
Riding with him, however, also highlights how distracted drivers become once they pick up their phones. Several remain completely oblivious to the fact a lanky Dutchman has spent several minutes staring at them through the driver’s window, a camera attached to his white baseball cap – and that David, the Guardian photographer, is training a longer lens on them from across the street. Such up-close footage is needed because using a handheld phone is only deemed illegal if there is proof of interactive communication, such as sending messages, talking, or commenting on social media – although this law is due to be updated this year. “It means I have to get right up close and personal,” says Van Erp, who now uses a high-spec GoPro. What of those who argue that using a phone in stationary traffic does no harm? Van Erp has little patience with this – noting the “WhatsApp gap” – the way phone-distracted drivers tend to jerk forwards belatedly when the queue moves, often after a toot from behind. “There is evidence that phone use is as dangerous as drink-driving. I think it’s also very naive to imagine these people only use their phone in [stationary] traffic,” he says. Yet aside from his phone-use videos, his YouTube channel also documents an arguably more confrontational strand of his activism. A few years ago, Van Erp heard how queueing drivers at another London junction, in Regent’s Park, were impatiently darting down the wrong side of a traffic island to reach a right-hand turn – sometimes nearly hitting cyclists who were going the right way.
He began lurking at the junction, and if a car tried the manoeuvre he would step out in front of it, blocking its path, and ordering the driver to go back. The results make compulsive viewing. In one particularly astonishing episode, currently on 1.7m views and rising, a pair of doctors in a hulking Volvo SUV are aghast at being challenged and insist that their profession means the driver should be allowed to flout road laws. But the most-watched clip, at almost 4m views, sees a driver become so incensed he bumps Van Erp several times with his Mercedes. When the police arrive the driver starts to argue with them too. Van Erp’s resolve – what he calls “a good example of Dutch stubbornness” – however, seems as unshakeable as his good humour. “You know what keeps me the most even-tempered? It’s the camera,” he says. “I know that the consequence will come anyway, and I know that I’m filming myself, and it’ll look worse if I behave badly. And also, the kinder and calmer I am, the worse it looks for the driver.” He regularly receives threats on social media, where he faces a near-continual barrage of anonymous insults. But again, his actions are rooted in painful personal experience of the consequences of such driving: when Van Erp was at school, he witnessed a friend being struck by a taxi driving the wrong way round a traffic island. His friend survived, but was badly injured. It’s not all criticism, however. Van Erp also has fans. “Mikey is an inspiration, genuinely,” says Jeremy Vine, the radio and TV presenter, who also chronicles the bad driving he sees on his bike commute via snappily edited videos using a 360-degree helmet camera. “I often bump into him around London,” Vine says. “He is not mad, not obsessed, not a vigilante, not on a crusade. He simply believes rules are there to be followed, because it was a drunk driver breaking the rules that took the life of his father. The police can’t police everything, so people like Mikey fill in the gaps.” Van Erp uses his social media reach to spread the message that there are increasing numbers of camera-equipped cyclists, meaning that poor driving has consequences.
“I don’t really want the fame,” he says. “On the other hand I haven’t really got any choice about it. The result is I have to use it to spread the word about camera cyclists. “Most people are really quite careful towards others. But cars do blunt that a little bit. There’s something about being in a car that takes the kind edge off us. We’re insulated in a soundproof comfort zone, and we very much see it as our personal space.” With that, our chat ends and, camera still clamped to baseball cap, Van Erp cycles through the park towards home – not searching out dangerous drivers, but only too aware how easily one can arrive in your life, unheralded, and with devastating consequences.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/05/filming-cyclingmikey-dangerous-drivers-mike-van-erp-motorists-britain-roads-safer;7
237;237;5480;5480;Cuba’s vaccine success story sails past mark set by rich world’s Covid efforts;2022-01-05T10:00:38Z;['Ed Augustin'];['Cuba', 'Americas', 'World news', 'Coronavirus', 'Vaccines and immunisation'];"General Máximo Gómez, a key figure in Cuba’s 19th-century wars of independence against Spain once said: “Cubans either don’t meet the mark – or go way past it.” A century and a half later, the aphorism rings true. This downtrodden island struggles to keep the lights on, but has now vaccinated more of its citizens against Covid-19 than any of the world’s major nations. More than 90% of the population has been vaccinated with at least one dose of Cuba’s homegrown vaccines, while 83% have been fully inoculated. Of countries with populations of over a million, only the United Arab Emirates has a stronger vaccination record. “Cuba is a victim of magical realism,” said John Kirk, professor emeritus of Latin American studies at Dalhousie University, Canada. “The idea that Cuba, with only 11 million people, and limited income, could be a biotech power, might be incomprehensible for someone working at Pfizer, but for Cuba it is possible.” Like most Latin American countries, Cuba knew it would struggle to buy vaccines on the international market. So in March 2020, with foreign exchange reserves plummeting due to the loss of tourism revenue and ferocious new US sanctions, the island’s scientists got to work.
The gamble paid off: this spring Cuba became the smallest country in the world to successfully develop and produce its own Covid vaccines. Since then its well-staffed, if dilapidating universal health service, has rolled out injections at a fast clip, inoculating even young children (all vaccination on the island is voluntary). Both vaccines are over 90% effective, according to Cuban-run clinical trials conducted last spring. Successful rollout has brought infection rates down from among the highest in the western hemisphere last summer to low levels today.
Last August the island reported hundreds of Covid deaths per week; last week there were three. The vaccine success is all the more striking when set against the parlous state of the healthcare service in other areas. With hard currency inflows cut in half over the last two years, antibiotics are now so scarce that 20 pills of amoxicillin trade on the black market for the equivalent of a month’s minimum state salary. Out of plaster cast, doctors in some provinces now resort to wrapping broken bones in used cardboard. “Ever since the 1959 revolution, Cubans have embarked on these grand crusades which are quixotic yet often successful,” said Gregory Biniowsky, a Havana-based lawyer. A prime example, Biniowsky said, was Fidel Castro’s pipe dream of investing one billion dollars in biotech after the Soviet Union disintegrated. “Any rational adviser would have said this was not the time to invest resources in something that might bear fruit in 25 years. And yet here we are now … where these fruits of the biotech investment are saving lives.” Other quests have dramatically failed: the Ten Million Ton Sugar Harvest of 1970 aimed to produce an unprecedented amount of sugar to spur growth. But to cut the cane, workers were pulled from their regular jobs, paralysing industry and wreaking havoc on the economy. Last year Cuba harvested seven times less sugar than in 1959.
“As a nation there’s a tendency to get really good with the big things, and awful at the everyday things,” said Hal Klepak, professor emeritus of history and strategy at the Royal Military College of Canada. “The whole idea of electrifying the country [in under a decade], abolishing illiteracy in 2.5 years, and medical internationalism – these were all just mad schemes. And they did it.” Today, Cuba posts tens of thousands of doctors and nurses doing humanitarian work abroad – but fails to grow enough potatoes for the population. Cuba’s highly centralized, state planning system – one of the last in the world – goes some way to explaining this paradox. When there is political will from the top, objectives can be driven forward; when there’s a lack of direction, the island’s rigid, Kafkaesque bureaucracy can elevate passing the buck to an art form. “In capitalism you tend to have, even with very little things, somebody to fill the market,” said Klepak. “The difference with Cuba is that for [most economic] decision-making, there isn’t anyone but the state.” After registering less than 100 cases a day for weeks, infection rates are now rising due to the highly contagious Omicron variant. Cuban scientists have not released data on the efficacy of their vaccines against Omicron but have begun work to update their vaccine against the variant. In the meantime, the Cuban ministry of public health has fast-tracked its booster campaign, and aims to give almost the entire population an extra shot of vaccine this month.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/cuba-coronavirus-covid-vaccines-success-story;3

If it was quiet they craved, they have not been disappointed. The only people on the streets of the village this afternoon are two older residents who sit on garden chairs by the church tower to chat and soak up the rays of the low winter sun. The peace and quiet, however, comes at a price. The doctor comes through just once a week, the village’s three children have an hour-long bus ride to school, and Milmarcos has precisely one shop and one bar. As Iturbe points out, only half-jokingly, this corner of Guadalajara province is one of the most hollowed-out parts of the demographic realm known as La España vaciada – the hollowed-out Spain. Decades of depopulation have left huge stretches of rural Spain starved of people, attention and investment, and prompted the country’s Socialist-led coalition government to establish a ministry for the demographic challenge. But for many in such areas, change has not come fast enough. At the end of September, an association of more than 160 local and regional groups decided to run as a joint platform in regional and national elections.
The España Vaciada platform took its inspiration from the fact that Teruel Existe, a movement that campaigns to improve conditions in the overlooked Teruel region of eastern Spain, managed to win one seat in congress and two in the senate in the November 2019 general election. Despite having just one MP, Teruel Existe has become a powerful force in a political landscape that is increasingly fragmented and dependent on horse-trading to get things done. Antonio Saz, a co-ordinator for the España Vaciada association, says that while the electoral platform may be new, the “struggle against depopulation and for territorial rebalancing” dates back at least 20 years. “We always say we’re not some kind of planned action; we’re the consequences of ignoring and abandoning the rural world and depopulated areas,” he says. “These problems are now on politicians’ agendas, even if we’re not yet seeing them in their programmes and actions.” Among the platform’s 101 initiatives is a national plan with guaranteed funding that would enable overlooked parts of the country to catch up with more developed ones, the creation of a non-political, expert agency to tackle depopulation, and improved rail links and services. “We also have a simple plan to drive recovery and balance things up that we call 100/30/30,” says Saz. “Thats 100mbps of symmetrical internet, 30 minutes to basic services such as education, health or security, and 30km [18 miles] to a high-capacity road. If we could get all that, we’d have a far more well-balanced country.”
The platform – which will face its first ballot-box test when it runs in February’s regional election in Castilla y León – is not fond of ideological labels. So would it be happy to strike deals with either the far-left Unidas Podemos or the far-right Vox? “Our ideology is driven by the vital necessity to tackle depopulation before it’s too late and we disappear – that’s what binds us more than left and right blocs,” says Saz. While he says it is far too early to speculate on electoral performances, Saz acknowledges the platform is keen to acquire the kind of clout Teruel Existe can exercise: “The more weight we have when it comes to seats, the more they’ll listen to us and the more we can do.” José Pablo Ferrándiz, a social sciences lecturer at Madrid’s Carlos III University, says the platform is likely to pose the biggest threat to Spain’s old political duopoly – the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) and the conservative People’s party (PP). “In the face of these new demands – which actually aren’t new at all – the two big parties can’t say they’re the ones who are going to solve these problems because they’ve been voted in before and haven’t solved them,” he says. Ferrándiz thinks the arrival of España Vaciada – which follows the eruption in recent years of Podemos, Vox and the fading, centre-right Citizens party – could herald even greater fragmentation. “In a national political scenario where even the vote of Teruel Existe is fundamental in forming majorities – and potentially even in forming governments – the PP and the PSOE know that if these platforms grow and win even three or four seats, they will be important when it comes to forming national governments.”
Back at the brewery, Iturbe is labelling beer bottles, keeping an eye on the electoral developments – and refusing to get her hopes up. “At least the platform is made up of people who know the rural world, so perhaps it’ll do something,” she says. “But on a national level, nothing’s changed politically and even after Podemos and Citizens, it’s all back in the hands of the PP and the PSOE.” Time, however, is running out for Milmarcos and for tens of thousands of other Spanish villages. As Iturbe notes, only a third of Milmarcos’s permanent residents are around 50 or younger. In 10 years’ time, many of its older people will be dead and its children will probably be thinking about moving elsewhere. “The politicians need to listen to us, because they haven’t so far,” she says. “They need to differentiate between the urban and the rural but at the moment, all the laws are drawn up in offices in the city, which means there’s no way they suit our needs. No matter how many times they come out here in their chauffeured cars, they never get it.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/empty-promise-new-political-group-speaks-up-depopulated-rural-spain-espana-vaciada;1

240;240;5483;5483;'Sir Tony Blair'? How cheaply knighthoods come in our broken honours system  | Simon Jenkins;2022-01-05T09:27:57Z;['Simon Jenkins'];['Tony Blair', 'Honours system', 'Politics', 'UK news'];So, Anthony Charles Lynton “call me Tony” Blair must now be called Sir Tony. In addition to being “Right Honourable” he is to be the Queen’s Companion, chivalrous and knightly. He is to wear a royal garter, the highest honour the monarch can bestow, and it is her personal decision. Gasps all round. A petition of protest has received almost 700,000 signatures already. On paper the reason for the garter, not a normal knighthood, is that Blair was once prime minister and all former holders of that office get one, as they once got earldoms. James Callaghan did, as did Margaret Thatcher. The difference is that Blair’s honour has been delayed for 15 years. The palace might argue that there are only three vacancies in the 24-strong companionship and there are four ex-prime ministers waiting, along with other worthy candidates. That does not explain the delay in Blair’s case. In the light of history, Blair was not a peculiarly bad prime minister. In winning three general elections he might even be rated a success. The two wars into which he led his nation, in Afghanistan and Iraq, were heavily supported by some at the time. But the charge against him, as confirmed by the Chilcot report, is that he woefully misled parliament and the public in stating his case. Hundreds of Britons and hundreds of thousands of foreigners died – and are still dying – as a result of Britain’s participation in those wars. Plenty of people did not think much of Thatcher, who also went to war, but no howl greeted her garter. The Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has suggested that all ex-prime ministers should be knighted on leaving office, simply for having done “one of the toughest jobs in the world”. Like permanent secretaries, senior judges and (most) Commons Speakers, they deserve a farewell pat on the back, and a knighthood comes cheap. To this extent, Blair would be entitled to his reward. But, in that case, someone should have said so and done it. As it is, the delay over Blair looks like a deliberate judgment somewhere in Buckingham Palace. Were some courtiers muttering, “Must we really, what with Iraq and all that?” Were others saying, “It’s over, just get on with it”? As for numbers, they might hope that with a bit of luck, next-in-line Gordon Brown will refuse, and David Cameron can be dumped in the Lords, where his recent misdeeds will vanish in its mire of sleaze. In other words, the delay in the award to Blair could indeed be a royal comment on his botched job – at which point we should best treat it as matter closed. More evidence, if it were needed, that our entire “honours” system and its associated nomenclature is an outdated mess. Britain has inherited an honours system that, like its Church of England and parliament itself, is shrouded in past fashion and fancy language that it seems incapable of reforming. Honours are divided between people who get them through their job, people who merit them and people who buy them. The cynicism of Boris Johnson’s (and Cameron’s) purchased honours has brought the House of Lords to a new low. I can think of no other democracy where membership of its parliament is so brazenly up for sale. It is not good enough to say it does not matter much. If it is to serve as the nation’s comment on the performance of public figures, a system of honours should convey meaning, not time-serving. In a climate of sleaze and corruption, the case is overwhelming for a commission to clean up and modernise the hierarchy of national awards. Parliament, politics and Downing Street should have nothing to do with it. We can eliminate archaic references to empires, saints, baths, garters and chivalry. We can stick to orders of merit. As for prime ministers, their reward is best kept in heaven, or at least confined to the lucrative lecture circuit and memoir catalogue. It is there that the nation can best express its appreciation of their work. • This article was amended on 6 January 2022. An estimate of the death toll resulting from the UK’s participation in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was changed from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.

241;241;5484;5484;Coalition won’t budge on free rapid Covid tests for all but concession card-holders are covered;2022-01-05T09:13:17Z;['Sarah Martin'];['Health', 'Coronavirus', 'Australian politics', 'Australia news'];"Up to 10 rapid antigen tests will be offered free to more than 6 million concession card-holders under a new national cabinet agreement but everyone else who is not a close contact of a case and symptomatic will still have to pay. State and territory leaders met on Wednesday to consider how to overcome the national testing crisis which has seen pathology services overwhelmed, rapid tests in short supply, and price gouging by some retailers. Dismissing growing calls for universal free access to rapid antigen tests (RATs), the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said national cabinet had agreed to provide the tests to concession card-holders through the national pharmacy network.
Supplies will become available within the next two weeks and limited to 10 each over the next three months – with no more than five per month.
The 6.6 million people eligible include those with commonwealth seniors cards, healthcare cards, low-income cards, pension cards and DVA gold and white cards. With the peak in Omicron cases still weeks away, national cabinet also signed off on additional measures to ease pressure on state testing sites and pathology services, which have been plagued by delays. The changes include ditching a requirement that someone who tests positive using a RAT confirms the result with a PCR test and exempting truck drivers, those being admitted to hospital, and overseas travellers from most testing requirements. Queensland and Tasmania will continue to require RATs for travel into those states until vaccination rates reach certain thresholds but travellers will no longer be able to access rapid tests at clinics in Victoria and New South Wales. The federal government will also seek to shield businesses from occupational health and safety obligations that may be requiring businesses to compulsorily test employees. “If you are not a close contact, if you are not symptomatic, you do not need to get a test – that is the advice,” Morrison said. If you do fall into that category testing is free, he confirmed on Wednesday. “We need to ensure that we are focusing those testing resources on the essential tests that are required, not casual tests.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Morrison, whose proposal for cash payments for RATs was overruled by the state and territory leaders in favour of using the pharmacy network, said none of the leaders had argued for universal access to free rapid tests. “To make that very clear, universal free access was not considered the right policy response by all of the states and territories in attendance today,” Morrison said. The cost for the concessional tests will be split between the commonwealth and the states. Morrison said securing supplies had been the responsibility of state governments but the commonwealth had secured an extra 20m rapid antigen tests, with 10m of these to be provided to the states to be used as “point of care” tests administered by health professionals. A total of 200m tests are now forecast to arrive in the country over the next two months but the prime minister warned that the pressure on the testing system would continue over the coming weeks. “Not only I, but all the chief ministers and premiers all understand the challenges currently being faced across the country, particularly in relation to the testing queues, we understand is incredibly frustrating and is highly disruptive, particularly the people’s plans at this time of year,” the prime minister said.
He said this was the result of the “volume challenges” posed by the Omicron variant and dismissed suggestions the commonwealth should have secure additional RAT supplies earlier. The federal government is also making changes aimed at preventing price gouging and hoarding, using changes to the Biosecurity Act to prevent retailers from putting more than a 20% mark-up on tests. Penalties include jail terms and fines of up to $66,000. When asked how many tests he had personally paid for, Morrison suggested his wife, Jenny, had purchased them when needed for private purposes, but otherwise he had used stock provided by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, provided on Wednesday an update on the current wave, saying that over the past fortnight while case numbers grew, the hospitalisation rate went down as did the proportion of cases in intensive care. Morrison said state and territory governments would develop a system for reporting positive Covid cases using rapid antigen tests, but in the meantime, he encouraged anyone who tested positive using an at-home kit to contact their GP. The decision to restrict the access of free tests comes despite a growing chorus in support of making the rapid antigen tests free, including from health experts, unions, business groups, and the federal opposition. “It’s very clear the simplest way to do it is to make tests free and make them available,” the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said ahead of the meeting. “People are crying out for action, the economic consequences of this government’s failure to put in place a proper system are there for all to see.”
The Australian Medical Association called for the government to abandon its market-based approach and provide the RATs publicly. The AMA and the Public Health Association of Australia said freely accessible rapid tests would play an “essential role in a pandemic that is looking increasingly out of control”. The AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said the government was “running out of time to get widespread use of RATs in the community under way and support people to do the right thing”. The head of the influential Doherty Institute, Sharon Lewin, also recommended making the tests free as the country shifted its approach, telling ABC’s 7.30 program on Tuesday night tests should be “widely accessible and free”.
The national council of the St Vincent de Paul Society said the tests needed to be made free to everyone but particularly the most vulnerable. “We urge all governments to ensure people with disability or other vulnerabilities, and the people who support them, have free and easy access to these tests,” the national president, Claire Victory, said. The Australian Youth Affairs Coalition also raised concern about the prohibitive cost of tests for young people which was “impacting their ability to remain safe”. Amid the rolling testing crisis, the government has been encouraging Australians to take up booster vaccines to try to limit the spread of infections. A total of 176,223 third doses were administered on Tuesday. More than 64,000 Covid cases were reported nationally on Wednesday – up from 48,000 the previous day. It was the highest daily total during the pandemic in Australia. NSW registered a record high 35,054 cases and eight deaths, while Victoria reported 17,636 cases and 11 deaths. Tasmania had a record 867 infections, with Queensland reaching 6,781, SA with 3,493, the ACT 810 and the Northern Territory 117.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/coalition-wont-budge-on-free-rapid-covid-tests-for-all-but-concession-card-holders-are-covered;7
242;242;5485;5485;The expanded NFL season has brought in more money. But what about drama?;2022-01-05T09:12:34Z;['Dave Caldwell'];['NFL', 'US sports', 'Sport'];Alvin Kamara, the versatile running back for the New Orleans Saints, went a little ballistic in March after he found out that the NFL was about to add a 17th game to the regular season. Kamara tapped out a four-word tweet: Two were curses, and a third was “dumb”. Even though the NFL agreed to pony up a bigger share of its revenue to the players, Kamara and many others were not so keen on a 17-game regular season, because they’d be expected to actually play in them (the players’ union passed the new schedule by just 60 votes). A 16-game schedule was already punishing enough. As it turned out, Kamara must wait to find out what it is like to play 17 regular-season games, because, owing to the hazards of his occupation, Kamara missed four straight games late in the season with knee and hamstring injuries. But at least Kamara will be one of the lucky ones who gets to play in a meaningful 17th game. If the Saints (8-8) beat Atlanta (7-9) on Sunday, and San Francisco (9-7) lose to the Los Angeles Rams (12-4), New Orleans will earn the final NFC wildcard playoff berth. There are other games worth watching, namely the season-ending matchup between the Los Angeles Chargers (9-7) and Las Vegas Raiders (9-7), with the winner going to the playoffs and the loser done for the year (though there is an unlikely way both could make it, ugh). But only three of 14 playoff spots are still up for grabs, hardly a rousing crescendo. A year ago, going into the final weekend of the 16-game regular season, seven spots were unclaimed. Six of eight division titles have been clinched, the same as at this point last year. This year, 11 of the 16 games on the final weekend of the regular season carry playoff implications – including seedings – the same as last year. Green Bay (13-3) have wrapped up the NFC regular-season title and a first-round bye, though Aaron Rodgers says he will play Sunday despite a nagging toe injury, and Tennessee (11-5) can do the same in the AFC on Sunday by beating the terrible Texans (4-12). Even the slog for the No 1 overall pick in this year’s draft carries little suspense, because Indianapolis (9-7) need to beat awful Jacksonville (2-14) to clinch a wildcard playoff berth – and because the Jaguars already have the guy they want to rebuild around, rookie quarterback Trevor Lawrence. There is no consensus No 1 draft pick this year, let alone a quarterback that scouts see as a surefire star. Many games will serve as essentially open auditions for players to get a few more highlights on tape so their agents can shop them around in the off-season. As a result, the games might not look much different than the fourth preseason contest that the 17th game replaced. So what has the extension accomplished? Well, more all-important incoming cash for the teams, of course, but not any more drama. For this, you can partly blame the NFL’s desire to expand beyond the US. When the NFL announced the expansion of its schedule, commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement, “One of the benefits of each team playing 17 regular-season games is the ability for us to continue to grow our game around the world.” What he meant, to be specific, is the ability to schedule four games per season outside the US, with each team required to play at least one game on foreign soil every eight years. Not only do the players get to play more games, more than a few will get to travel a bit more. Those trips – and a little more money – may be one of the few benefits to players. Pro football players are paid pretty well, relatively speaking. The minimum NFL salary in 2021 was $610,000 for a player with no experience and $1.05m for players with at least seven years’ experience, many times more than the median US wage of $56,000. But the average NFL career only lasts a little more than three years and players tend to break down, something a longer regular season will probably only exacerbate. The battered Baltimore Ravens (8-8) still have a chance to make the playoffs if they beat Pittsburgh, and the Chargers, Colts and Dolphins lose (or if Miami tie). But only three players who started on offense for the Ravens in their season opener also started last weekend against the Rams. The coronavirus, to which no team seems to be immune, has shredded plans this year. The Philadelphia Eagles, needing a Minnesota loss Sunday to Green Bay to clinch a playoff spot, appeared to benefit from the absence of Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins. And then, boom! Twelve Philadelphia players were placed on the Reserve-Covid 19 list Monday afternoon. Even if the season were virus-free, a 17th game offers another opportunity for top players to shine – or get hurt, diminishing the quality of play in the short and long term. Goodell claimed in March that more players get hurt in preseason games, side-stepping the fact that top players participated very little, if at all, in those fourth preseason games. Besides, whoever ends up winning the Vince Lombardi Trophy won’t be the first NFL champion to have played 17 regular-season games. The 1926 Frankford Yellow Jackets won 14, lost one and tied two. The Yellow Jackets played four Saturday-Sunday home-and-away sets. But there were no playoffs, so they were awarded the title by a consensus of reporters. The designated championship game, played before 7,000 chilly fans at Frankford Stadium in Philadelphia, was a dud: a 0-0 tie with the Pottsville Maroons. A 40-yard field-goal attempt was caught by a gust of wind, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the 10-yard line. So there have been more anticlimactic finishes to the NFL regular season. Just wait for Sunday night. The Raiders and Chargers may play to a tie. The Chargers would get in, but so would the Raiders if the Colts also lose.

243;243;5486;5486;Football transfer rumours: Arsenal make bid for Fiorentina’s Vlahovic?;2022-01-05T09:11:23Z;['Barry Glendenning'];['Football', 'Sport', 'Transfer window'];"Having secured their first signing of the January window in agreeing a £12m (and rising) fee for Atlético Madrid and England full-back Kieran Trippier, Newcastle hope to further bolster their hopes of avoiding relegation by bringing an injury-prone Welsh midfielder to Tyneside from Turin. Speculation abounds that Aaron “Rambo” Ramsey could swap the black and white stripes of Juventus for those of the slightly less decorated English club, although reports he has turned down an approach from Burnley because he wants to sit in the physio room of a more high-profile club suggest Newcastle’s owners will have to dig deep in a bid to turn his head. Ramsey has also been linked with a return to Arsenal and could share a taxi from Luton airport to their nearby St Albans training ground with his Juve teammates Dejan Kulusevski and Arthur Melo. Gazzetta dello Sport reports that Arsenal have formally bid the thick end of £45m (plus the £15m-rated Lucas Torreira) for Fiorentina’s 21-year-old Serbian striker Dusan Vlahovic, who already has 16 Serie A goals to his name this season. A player in big demand across Europe, Vlahovic seems happy enough where he is for the time being. “Only God knows what will happen in the next period,” he said recently. “My desire is to take Fiorentina to Europe, because we haven’t been in Europe for a long time. We’ll see.”
Chelsea, West Ham and yes, you’ve guessed it, Newcastle are all interested in liberating French left-back Lucas Digne from his Everton purgatory, but will have to pay up to £30m to get their man. “The most important thing for me is having players on the pitch who want to be there,” said beleaguered Everton boss Rafa Benítez after dropping Digne and playing right-back Séamus Coleman in his position in defeat against Brighton on Sunday, in a state of affairs that suggests the player will be shown the Goodison door this month unless his manager goes first. Manchester United central defender Axel Tuanzebe’s season-long loan to Aston Villa has been brought to a premature end after Villa boss Steven Gerrard refused to give the 24-year-old assurances he’d get game time in the second half of the season. He’ll be off to Napoli. Arsenal midfielder Ainsley Maitland-Niles is another young buck who could be Serie A-bound and may wrap up his loan to Roma on Wednesday. Having been forced to read an entire paragraph without seeing their club being linked with anybody in today’s Mill, Newcastle fans will be pleased to learn that Flamengo striker Gabriel Barbosa wouldn’t be adverse to a move to St James’ Park despite the resident club’s lowly league position, but is also wanted by goal-shy Wolverhampton Wanderers. Depending on your news outlet of choice West Ham definitely do or do not want the 25-year-old Brazilian international, but are reported to have definitely cooled their interest in Adama Traoré. Aymeric Laporte could become the latest player to tread the well worn path between Manchester City and Barcelona, with the Catalan club apparently prepared to send Frenkie de Jong the other way in a swap deal.
And finally, rumours abound that the worrying number of preening, self-regarding and under-performing divas who currently occupy the Manchester United dressing-room continue to scoff at the notion that they might be in any way responsible for their poor performances and are already plotting a mutiny against recently-appointed manager Ralf Rangnick, with whom they are reported to be underwhelmed.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/football-transfer-rumours-arsenal-make-bid-for-fiorentina-dusan-vlahovic;4
244;244;5487;5487;Planet Covid: Inside the 7 January Guardian Weekly;2022-01-05T09:00:37Z;['Graham Snowdon'];['Coronavirus', 'South Africa', 'Medical research', 'Vaccines and immunisation'];In welcoming you to the first Guardian Weekly magazine of 2022, I’d like to start by rewinding a couple of years. Buried in the 10 January 2020 edition was a small but significant story. “Respiratory contagion is not Sars, authorities say” was the headline on a short global report, at the foot of page 7, about a mysterious infection in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Two years on, it’s fair to say we now know a little more now than we did then about that mysterious illness. But the broader context of the pandemic can still be tricky to understand. This week, the Guardian’s data and visuals teams have collaborated to produce some beautiful graphics and analysis, revealing the pandemic’s global impact in a new light. Then, our China affairs correspondent, Vincent Ni, explores why, after two years, the search for Covid’s origins remains shrouded in politics and confusion. The conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell for sex-trafficking offences concluded one of the most closely followed trials in recent times. Will this draw a line under the case – or will US prosecutors’ attention now turn to other known associates and employees of the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein? South Africa has been in the news lately, for the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant and for the death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Both stories have touched on issues of governance in the “rainbow nation” (as Tutu described it after the fall of apartheid), so it is both sad and disturbing to read Jason Burke’s dispatch on how many citizens seem to be losing faith in the power of government altogether. It wouldn’t be a new year’s edition without pause to reflect on personal goals for the coming months. Johann Hari unpacks the fascinating topic of concentration, asking why so many of us have lost our ability to focus, and if it’s too late to do anything about it. Then, if your New Year resolutions are already going to pot, Rebecca Seal has some reassuring advice – just don’t worry about it.

245;245;5488;5488;Could 2022 be sportswashing’s biggest year?;2022-01-05T09:00:36Z;['Karim Zidan'];['Winter Olympics Beijing 2022', 'World Cup 2022', 'Football', 'Sport', 'World Cup', 'Saudi Arabia'];"The year 2022 – which launches into the Olympic Games in Beijing and ends with the World Cup in Qatar – is set to be a great year for authoritarian regimes looking to cover up their atrocious human rights records. Over the course of a 12-month period, countries such as China, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, all of whom have been criticized for human rights violations, will use prestigious sports events to polish their public image on an international stage. This process is known as sportswashing, a term popularized by Amnesty International in 2018 to describe the use of sports by oppressive governments to legitimize their regimes and distract from their human rights abuses. Traditional examples of sportswashing include the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin under the Nazi regime, which Hitler hosted in an attempt to showcase German and Aryan superiority. While sportswashing has long been a popular tactic, 2022 is a particularly concerning year because both the Olympic Games and the World Cup – the two most-watched sporting events in the world – are being hosted in countries with markedly oppressive regimes. Beginning on 4 February, China will host the Winter Olympics in Beijing and in towns in the neighboring Hebei province. Among other issues, the country’s government has been criticized for its inhumane internment of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region, its attempts to seize political control over Hong Kong and neighboring Taiwan, and the disappearance (and questionable reappearance) of tennis star Peng Shuai after accusing a Chinese official of sexual assault.
Several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have announced that they will not send any government representatives to the Games due to concerns over China’s human rights record. However, these nations will still send their athletes, rendering the diplomatic boycotts as little more than performative theatre. Other countries such as France (host of the 2024 Summer Games) and Italy will not join the boycott, while Russia’s President Vladimir Putin condemned the boycott as a “mistake”. China has since threatened that the countries who have announced diplomatic boycotts will “pay the price for their mistaken acts.” Following the Olympic Games, attention will shift towards the World Cup in Qatar, which is set to begin in November. The nation has a significant record of human rights violations. For example, a Guardian investigation from February 2021 revealed more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar since 2010. The shocking death toll, compiled from government sources, is most likely an underestimate and does not include data from other countries that send a significant number of workers to Qatar, including Kenya and the Philippines. Dozens of migrant workers have died during the construction of World Cup stadiums in particular, and more than 100 migrants employed on a construction project related to the event went up to seven months without pay. Most employees were eventually compensated, though some still have several months of missing salaries. Other significant human rights issues in Qatar include restrictions on free expression, forced labor, the criminalization of same-sex relationships, and a lack of accountability for violence against women and minorities. Reforms aimed at protecting migrant workers from exploitative labor were introduced in 2020, though employers maintain disproportionate power and influence. Despite the harrowing reports of death and abuse in the construction of World Cup stadiums, Fifa president Gianni Infantino announced on 30 December that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was a “celebration of football and social inclusion”. “Fifa is the only governing body that looks after and cares about the entire world,” Infantino said in a prepared statement. “We will continue working hard to live up to the mission of not forgetting the ones who need most and who have no voice, while also protecting the healthy growth of everyone else and the global football movement.” While China and Qatar will host the two most significant sports events of 2022, other countries such as Saudi Arabia continue to expand their positions as key destinations for international sports events. The kingdom has spent billions on high-profile sports events aimed at strengthening its reputation and diversifying its economy to eliminate dependence on oil and gas. Most recently, a group led by Saudi’s sovereign wealth fund – an entity headed by Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman – purchased Newcastle United. It is arguably one of the kingdom’s most successful sportswashing attempts, as it provides Saudi with an influential position in English football as well as an opportunity to upgrade its public image and distract from its recent abuses, including the infamous assassination of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, its devastating war in Yemen that caused a humanitarian catastrophe, and its crackdown on intellectuals, reformers, and women’s rights activists. Saudi Arabia has proved to be an alluring hub for sports events over the past few years, having signed a 10-year, $650m deal for a Formula One motor racing event, invested millions in a Saudi International golf event, and hosted some of the biggest boxing showdowns in recent memory. The kingdom has also hired the Boston Consulting Group to help lobby its interest in hosting a World Cup event in the not-so-distant future. There are other concerning sportswashing affiliations, including the Ultimate Fighting Championships’ troubling links to Chechnya’s dictator Ramzan Kadyrov, the NBA’s blossoming relationship with Rwandan autocrat Paul Kagame, and the NFL’s newly announced five-year partnership with China (which included a map that pushed the false narrative that Taiwan, an independent country, was a part of China). Each of these examples highlights the growing trend of authoritarian countries using prominent and established sports entities as platforms for propaganda and sportswashing campaigns. This strategy has proven to be remarkably effective in overhauling these states’ public images and legitimizing their regimes. As state-run political projects and soft power propaganda outfits take center stage over the coming year, 2022 is shaping up to be one of the most politically charged sporting years in recent memory.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/sportswashing-winter-olympics-world-cup;4
246;246;5489;5489;NYO/Edwards review – polished, energetic and joyous music-making;2022-01-05T08:14:48Z;['Flora Willson'];['Classical music', 'Music', 'Culture'];As openings go, it was at the subtler end of the bang-whimper spectrum. So subtle, in fact, that the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain’s first concert of 2022 began before most of the packed auditorium noticed. What sounded like pre-performance doodlings among the double basses and percussion suddenly cohered into a heavy tread of repeated notes and rhythmic filigree. As the rest of the orchestra filed on stage, the standard-issue minimalism (shades of Terry Riley’s In C) blossomed into more colourful textures. And then it all dissipated as mysteriously as it had begun, leaving the principal oboe playing a sustained A for tuning. There was no conductor and no music. Just, as we were told in one of multiple spoken cameos from players, the NYO’s trademark “unashamedly enthusiastic atmosphere”. Such devised pieces are now a regular feature: a reminder of how much the organisation provides for its members beyond high-level orchestral training. (Though nothing encapsulates the scale of Operation NYO better than their gargantuan pre-concert pizza order, which arrived as I did.) If the main body of the concert seemed more subdued than some NYO appearances, that’s surely because it was this cohort’s first outing, after a single week together. But the quality of playing under the careful, encouraging leadership of Sian Edwards was largely as polished as ever. Ravel’s La Valse emerged from barely-there rustles, taking flight in irresistibly brash climaxes. The middle movement of Karim Al-Zand’s City Scenes wove delicate skeins of percussion and strings, while Dani Howard’s Coalescence showcased on-the-money brass and exquisitely blended polychrome shimmer. Best of all were Rachmaninoff’s Symphonic Dances, which boasted a gorgeously mellow saxophone and tender strings, liquid ripples of woodwind and a muscular, sharply chiselled finale – and there’s no full orchestral sound quite like an NYO tutti, as this huge, energetic machine roars joyously into life. • At Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry on 7 January;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/05/nyo-sian-edwards-review-barbican-national-youth-orchestra;5
247;247;5490;5490;Footballers appearing on calendars in years they never played for the club | The Knowledge;2022-01-05T08:00:35Z;['Guardian sport'];['Football', 'Sport'];"“I’ve just looked through my 2021 Arsenal calendar before throwing it out,” begins Gordon Forbes. “Mr May, William Saliba, has made zero appearances for the club during 2021. Is there a higher profile calendar participant out there who did not play for his club during that same year?” We’ll deal with that question shortly but first let’s allow Gordon to show his workings: “Thanks mainly to Saliba (0,0 subs), Willian (eight,12 sub), Maitland-Niles (five, nine sub), David Luiz (16, one sub) and Héctor Bellerín (17, one sub) and with the post-summer contributions of Bernd Leno, Granit Xhaka, Kieran Tierney and Pépé I estimate that all 12 players in the calendar have only filled 306 of the 784 available places (starting XIs and all substitutions) during 2021. At 39% of available playing spots, is this indeed the most unrepresentative club calendar ever?” That additional question might be one for readers to answer next week but, thanks to the January transfer window, we have found a few examples that help answer the original question. Any Liverpool fans who had the club’s official 2018 calendar would have seen Philippe Coutinho staring at them from the wall in January, a month in which he never played for the club and left for Barcelona for around £142m. Similarly, Virgil van Dijk features in a composite image on the January page of Southampton’s 2018 offering having been confirmed as a Liverpool player on New Year’s Day. Andy Carroll was Newcastle’s Mr February on their 2011 wallchart having played the last game of his first stint at his boyhood club on 27 December 2010 before joining Liverpool. And two years later Demba Ba was the face of January 2013, a month in which he was in fine form … for Chelsea.
We have also unearthed a few calendar-appearing one-match wonders. Fikayo Tomori was pictured alongside Reece James for August in Chelsea’s official 2021 calendar, meaning his club appearances (one in the FA Cup on 10 January against Morecambe) matched those on the wallchart thanks to a loan move to Milan on 22 January that became a permanent transfer. And Wes Morgan (January on Leicester’s 24-player 2021 calendar) made just one appearance – for eight minutes in the Foxes’ victorious FA Cup final win over Chelsea – last year while Christian Fuchs (May) similarly played just once – 15 minutes in the Cup against Brighton – in 2021.
Big climbs and falls after Christmas Day (2) In our festive edition we detailed teams who had a remarkable turnaround in results after 25 December, and Ásgeir Ingólfsson has a great example from the land of fire and ice. “Concerning second half of the season meltdowns from leagues further afield, I present to you Þróttur from the Icelandic league. In the 2003 season they were top of the table at the halfway point with 18 points from nine games. They got only four points from the other nine games and ended up relegated (ninth out of 10 teams), despite being third as late as after the 14th round. In addition, they had two out of the three top scorers that summer.” Sacked after an abandoned game
Yes, they have Richard. “Dennis Greene left Boston after an abandoned FA Trophy tie at Witton Albion (having been losing 1-0 at half time),” writes Christian James. “We had lost 9-2 the week before.” And Alun Thomas has this: “Not an abandoned game, but Sunderland sacked Malcolm Crosby in February 1993 after the pools panel ruled they had lost a postponed game away to Tranmere.” Longest fixture in England “Brighton and Hove Albion v Wolverhampton Wanderers must be a contender for the longest fixture possible in the English leagues, in terms of letters used (43 letters excluding ‘v’). Any advance?” asks Tom Biltcliffe. It would appear to be the longest meeting of two clubs from the four professional leagues in England, Tom, but if we dip into the lower leagues we can find a lengthier matchup. “Havant & Waterlooville v Hampton & Richmond Borough in the National League South beats it by a character; even more (48) if you spell out the ampersands in full as with Brighton and Hove Albion,” writes Steve Hyde.
“I know Tom’s question was aimed at English leagues but if you expand it to include Scottish leagues, you can have Inverness Caledonian Thistle v Dunfermline Athletic (45 characters),” offers Adam Anderson. “A potential early round Scottish Cup clash between ICT and Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic (Scottish Lowland League), would also produce 47 characters.” Knowledge archive “Dundalk scored after 12 seconds in the League of Ireland … after their opponents Derry had taken the kick-off,” wrote Sam Alanson in September 2014. “Is this the quickest goal ever scored by a team who didn’t kickoff?” The short answer to this question is, no. But we had several responses from which we have permed the following quickfire top four, including the fastest goals in the entire history of the FA Cup, the Champions League and the World Cup: 9 seconds: Roda v Den Haag, October 2011. Den Haag took the lead nine seconds after the home side took the kick-off, but it didn’t help them much: they lost the game 5-2. Thanks to Stephan Wijnen for the tip-off. 9 seconds: Reading v West Brom, February 2010. “Nine seconds was all it took for the home side to seize the lead,” we reported. “Albion had kicked off and the ball was fed swiftly to right-back Gianni Zuiverloon, but the Dutchman dallied, allowing Jimmy Kébé to pilfer possession and then guide a low shot under the goalkeeper.” Hat-tip to Adam Roberts for the reminder. 10.12 seconds. Bayern Munich v Real Madrid, March 2007. Hat-tip to Joe Foley for this one. Roy Makaay’s goal remains the fastest in the Champions League, and as an added bonus it contributed to eliminating Madrid from the Champions League. 10.80 seconds. South Korea v Turkey, July 2002. The World Cup third-place play-off, Hong Myung-bo is a little bit too relaxed with his first touch, and Hakan Sukur pounces. Yaad Ilani suggested that one.
Can you help? “What is the largest goal tally for two teams combined drawing in both their home and away fixtures in a season? I presume there are examples of say 3-3 and 4-4 but are there any really big tallies where they just got two points?” asks John McDougall.
“I was interested to read that Celtic captain Callum McGregor has won all 14 of the finals that he’s played in for the Hoops,” writes David Shearan. “Has anyone bettered this record?”
“Raheem Sterling has scored 18 goals for England, all in competitive matches,” notes Yasin Uddin. “Are there other players with similar records and which player has the highest number of international goals without padding their stats in friendlies?”
“Porto have won the Primeira Liga 29 times, and the main domestic cup 17 times, but are yet to win the Portuguese League Cup (which admittedly only began in 2007) having lost four finals,” writes Niall McVeigh. “Are there other examples of trophy-laden teams with a drought in one particular domestic competition?”

248;248;5491;5491;Starmer still has to answer the big question: where does Labour stand on socialism? | Simon Fletcher;2022-01-05T08:00:35Z;['Simon Fletcher'];['Keir Starmer', 'Labour', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"On the back of encouraging polls – including one that eliminated the Tory lead on the economy – Keir Starmer started the new year with a speech linking the months of Tory corruption and incompetence to a wider argument about Britain. Though the Labour leader is surely correct to acknowledge that his party can’t just rely on Tory collapse, there is some way to go to turn the headings of security, prosperity and respect into something that can capture the public imagination. Tucked away near the start of his speech was a small reference to the other Keir, Hardie, in the context of a point about patriotism. “The Labour party is a deeply patriotic party. Keir Hardie once said that British socialism must ‘wear a local garb’. He meant that British socialism was rooted in the everyday concerns of working people.” But while Hardie’s socialism was quoted, we heard no more from the present Keir about his own. It is something he must address but seems reluctant to. In an interview last month, Starmer was asked whether he was a socialist. He refused to say, asking “what does that mean?”, moving quickly past the question. It was a strange response. Each Labour leader has had to define where they stood in relation to socialism. Labour was established through an alliance including trade unionists and socialists. Through clause IV of its constitution it was committed to a form of widespread common ownership. Leading figures from all parts of the party have argued about what socialism is. That contested nature is a reflection of its role in the political life of the party. There are two broad considerations that flow from Starmer’s answer. One is the perennial need to engage with and answer what is, or should be, a central question; and it is worth noting that leaders from the party’s centre and right have done so to further their own purposes as much as the left. Answering it, with certainty and clarity, certainly need not be a barrier to electoral success. But, the other is that the crises of the 21st century – the pandemic and climate – surely cry out for a politics based on socialism. Reaction to Starmer’s positioning was not limited to Labour’s left. The commentator John Rentoul, hardly a proselytist for the left, argued that he ought to have answered “yes, of course”, and then should have defined what socialism means to him. The Labour leader’s answer was particularly unusual because in 2020, he had set out his view of socialism in a Guardian article. “If I see something wrong or spot an injustice, I want to put it right,” he argued, adding: “We can win again if we make the moral case for socialism, a moral socialism, that is relevant to people’s everyday lives and the challenges we face as we move into the 2020s and 2030s.” I took part in the discussion that preceded the publication of Starmer’s article. There was never any question that such a statement of political values was unnecessary or a hostage to fortune. It was a function of being a senior Labour politician that you set out a wider philosophy.
His was not everyone’s view of socialism. But in a sense, it was his attempt to answer in advance the question put to him more recently. That “moral socialism” piece, so carefully thought through, makes the Labour leader’s subsequent non-answer all the more perplexing. Why resile from it? Perhaps Labour’s leadership is inclined to avoid anything that nods to the wider left. Yet all Labour leaders, left and right, have to resolve their approach to socialism. Ed Miliband said he was bringing it back. Tony Blair’s replacement for clause IV declared “the Labour party is a democratic socialist party”. Neil Kinnock, well versed in the language of the labour movement, was interviewed for Marxism Today, whose analysis was seen to be of use to a Labour leader moving the party rightwards. Some may say that any talk of socialism is a turn-off, but no one is so naive as to believe that Labour ought to fight the next election with socialism as its slogan. Jeremy Corbyn’s overarching platform was not “vote Labour for socialism”, but “for the many not the few”. People will vote for left politicians of every stripe because their stances and policies connect to the direct interests and values of the voters. The challenge is to work out how to apply socialist ideas in order to advance at an electoral level. Our times demand more, not less, socialism. Polling consistently shows high levels of support for socialism among young people – to the alarm of rightwing analysts. Even among the wider population, including in the US, positive and negative views of capitalism and socialism poll closely together. More importantly, the free market has offered no solutions to the most fundamental aspects of the present pandemic. The state has had to intervene, massively and repeatedly. Ninety-seven per cent of the funding for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine came from the public sector and charities, for example. The vaccines would have been impossible without the state. Gordon Brown’s demand for global action to end the scandal of undervaccination around the world should remind us that this is an unequal planet, organised to the benefit of a relatively small number of rich countries. A socialist view looks at the contending class interests in society. In any given situation socialists will ask, who pays? So it is with the fallout of this pandemic. No new furlough for the Omicron wave has left huge numbers of workers in the lurch. The TUC highlighted the worst Christmas wage squeeze in nearly a decade. Many key workers, having seen the economy through the phases of the pandemic, can now expect a pay cut. The Treasury’s case that public sector pay settlements should not keep pace with inflation equates to a real-terms reduction. The pandemic has seen our society gripped by questions long-raised by socialists: internationalism, collectivism, inequality, class interests, planning, public ownership and state intervention versus the free market. The same applies to the climate crisis. Labour appears reluctant, but it simply must engage with where it stands on socialism. It is just over 30 years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. At the time, many on the right hoped that seismic event would also mean the end for a politics that looked to a future beyond capitalism. It was never likely then, and the twin global challenges of Covid-19 and climate emergency must surely lead to the opposite conclusion now.

249;249;5492;5492;‘Appalling message’: outrage over Novak Djokovic’s medical exemption to play Australian Open;2022-01-05T07:44:35Z;['Josh Taylor'];['Novak Djokovic', 'Sport', 'Tennis', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Melbourne', 'Coronavirus', 'Victoria', 'Australia news'];"The decision to grant Novak Djokovic an exemption from Covid-19 vaccination requirements to play in the Australian Open in Melbourne has been labelled “appalling”, with some players expressing surprise at the late decision. On Tuesday night, the defending Australian Open champion posted on Instagram that he was coming to Melbourne to participate in the tennis tournament with an “exemption permission”. All Australian Open participants must either be fully vaccinated or apply for and secure a medical exemption in order to enter Victoria without undertaking the mandatory 14-day quarantine.
Tennis Australia said players seeking an exemption went through a two-stage process, with their application first considered by a panel of experts in Tennis Australia, and then an assessment from the Victorian government.
But on Wednesday afternoon, the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, indicated the federal government might also have a say in the matter. Andrews said in a statement it was for Tennis Australia and the Victorian government to decide whether a non-vaccinated player could take part in the Australian Open but “it is the commonwealth government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, subsequently said when Djokovic arrived “if he is not vaccinated he must provide acceptable proof that he cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons”. “If that evidence is insufficient, then he won’t be treated any different to anyone else and will be on the next plane home – there should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic,” Morrison said in Canberra. The chief executive of Tennis Australia, Craig Tiley, said the exemption granted to Djokovic was the same medical exemption anyone can get under the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) guidelines.
“If there are several reasons why they are unable to be vaccinated, Atagi have set out very clear guidelines that have to be followed in order for you to be added to the Australian immunisation register and if you are added to that register, you are then exempt from a vaccination and can come into Australia,” he told Nine’s Today Show on Wednesday. “For tennis players, it was a process that was above and beyond what anyone coming to Australia would have experienced. Simply because we had an extra panel … which through a blind review assessed any application and then granted exemptions if it was appropriate.” Last year Djokovic said he was “opposed to vaccination” and added: “I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel … But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision.” Tiley said it was up to Djokovic to decide whether to disclose the reason the exemption was granted. The Atagi guidelines state exemptions can be given for those with acute medical conditions, including undergoing major surgery, those who have had Covid-19 in the past six months or have had a serious adverse event attributed to a previous Covid vaccine dose.
Tiley said in a press conference on Wednesday he could understand why people would be upset about the decision. “Some of you will be upset about the fact that Novak has come in because of his statements of the past couple of years around vaccination,” he said. “However, it’s ultimately up to him to discuss with the public his condition if you choose to do that, and the reason why he received an exemption. We as an event, also as a state, as a country, will do everything we possibly can to give everyone an equal opportunity to come into the country.” The state employment minister, Jaala Pulford, acknowledged Victorians would find the decision frustrating, but said the panel process to approve the exemption was “incredibly robust” and Djokovic had not received special treatment.
“I wanted to recognise and acknowledge that this outcome is something that many of the Victorian community find frustrating and upsetting,” Pulford said. “But I want to make absolutely clear that as has been the case the whole time, no one is receiving special treatment because of who they are or what they have achieved professionally.” Andrews said in her statement any individual seeking to enter Australia “must comply with our strict border requirements”. “If an arriving individual is not vaccinated, they must provide acceptable proof that they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons to be able to access the same travel arrangements as fully vaccinated travellers. “Australian Border Force will continue to ensure that those who arrive at our border comply with our strict border requirements. “No individual competing at the Australian Open will be afforded any special treatment.” Both Tiley and Pulford called on Djokovic to explain his medical exemption when he arrives in Australia. “I think it’ll certainly be helpful if Novak was to explain the condition for which he sought an exemption and he got the exemption,” Tiley said. “But ultimately, it’s up to him.” Public reaction to the news of Djokovic’s exemption was overwhelmingly hostile. Stephen Parnis, a former vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, said the decision was appalling. “I don’t care how good a tennis player he is. If he’s refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn’t be allowed in,” Parnis tweeted. “If this exemption is true, it sends an appalling message to millions seeking to reduce #COVID19Aus risk to themselves & others. #Vaccination shows respect, Novak.”
Australian tennis players James Duckworth and Alex de Minaur expressed surprise at the decision when asked at the ATP tournament in Sydney. “Look, I don’t know the criteria for exemptions. Yeah. Apparently it’s an independent panel. He must have fit the criteria somehow,” Duckworth said. “That’s very politically correct of you,” de Minaur replied. “I just think it’s very interesting. That’s all I’m going to say.” Tiley said 26 people associated with the Australian Open applied for a medical exemption to come to the tournament, but only a handful were granted. The deputy Victorian Liberal leader, David Southwick, said it was a “disgrace”. “What a disgrace! We have had 6 lockdowns – schools and small businesses closed, funerals and weddings told not to go ahead, families separated for months on end and now a tennis star gets an exemption,” he tweeted. “A kick in the guts to every Victorian.” The decision also drew an angry reaction on social media, with many predicting a hostile welcome for the nine-time Australian Open champion when he takes the court.
Former AFL great Kevin Bartlett said on Twitter that the public had been “taken for fools”. Russian tennis star Natalia Vikhlyantseva announced in December she would skip the Australian Open because the Sputnik vaccine she has received is not recognised in Australia. Just last month, Victoria’s deputy premier, James Merlino, said exemptions on medical grounds should not be viewed as a “loophole for privileged tennis players” and everyone at the Open is expected to be vaccinated. Last year Djokovic said he was “opposed to vaccination and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel … But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/appalling-message-outrage-over-novak-djokovics-medical-exemption-to-play-australian-open;4
250;250;5493;5493;Harrow by Joy Williams review – after the apocalypse;2022-01-05T07:30:35Z;['Sam Byers'];['Books', 'Fiction', 'Culture'];"In a bowling alley somewhere in postapocalyptic rural America, a 10-year-old savant is celebrating his birthday. His mother has chosen this moment to tell him, via the unusual method of having a murder scene rendered in icing on his cake, that his father killed his grandfather. The baker, though, has erred, and topped the cake instead with an edible version of Goya’s Saturn Devouring His Son, an image so disturbing it causes the child to question his own existence. “Saturn,” a party guest helpfully informs him, “represents Time, which, with its ravenous appetite for life, devours all its creations.” Later we will learn that the bowling alley never existed, and that some or all of these characters may very well be dead. Welcome, if you have not been here before, to the world of Joy Williams – widely praised, sadly not quite as widely read. My Vintage paperback of 2001’s dazzling The Quick and the Dead carries admiring quotes by Don DeLillo, Raymond Carver and Bret Easton Ellis, yet in the UK it is unforgivably out of print. Williams’s 2015 short story collection The Visiting Privilege was heralded by all who read it as a major literary event, yet it took the tiny imprint Tuskar Rock to bring it to the UK market. On the surface of it, Harrow, her first novel in more than 20 years, seems unlikely to broaden her audience. This is not to say the book is not brilliant – it is. It’s simply that Williams has made no concessions; she remains wonderfully and determinedly herself. What might be a little different, though, is the world into which her work emerges, and the reality she so daringly alchemises into her vision.
Attempting a precis of this novel feels like exactly the kind of misguided endeavour Williams would scorn, but allow me to try. Harrow is set in an undefined near future in which the global environmental situation has gone from being on “the verge that people thought would go on forever” to all-out catastrophe. Khristen, the novel’s not-quite-central character, briefly died as a baby, or so her mother adamantly believes, and may never have entirely returned. Post-disaster, amid a hallucinatory terrain that may or may not be an afterlife, she finds herself at The Institute, where a loose collective of geriatric terrorists “in the worst of health but with kamikaze hearts” plot suicide missions targeting vivisectionists and pesticide salesmen in the hope that this will “refresh, through crackpot violence, a plundered earth”. Williams’s method is one of adjacency more than linearity. Language, not narrative, is the connective tissue. To read her is to be flung every which way: from the spiritually profound to the farcically bizarre. One minute we observe “unprepared souls, moments from the clarity of their deaths”. The next, we are invited to consider the condition of a very old man’s penis: “She wondered if his pecker was as shredded and gribbled and nicked as the rest of him or whether it hung wondrously, impossibly smooth and aloof, its head like burled oak.” Every sentence is lathed into sleek and startling perfection. At the bowling alley, serious bowlers “held the afterward of their poses for a vanity of time”. A crashing car flies “like a crumpled Kleenex into a cement utility pole by which it was trephined with glittering efficiency”. A salesman is so talented he “could sell a shock collar to a Doberman”. Even seemingly offhand phrases glitter with wit. Admire if you will the sing-song perfection of “Eddie Fucking Emerald offed by a fatty in a Caddy”.
Zeroing in on our collective complacency and denial, Williams is both wry and merciless, lamenting “twelve lane highways with bicycle supplements” and people “who think they can still save the earth by grinding up some modest nut or bean for pancake meal”. A pre‑collapse environmental conference includes a talk entitled The Potentiality of Landscape’s Emptiness: The Integrity of Half Measures. A TV channel streams nothing but minutes of silence. “We all lead three lives,” Khristen is told. “The true one, the false one, and the one we are not aware of.” This life we’re not aware of is Williams’s great subject. She peels back the visible and known, revealing death and chaos beneath. Wandering around a rescue centre for birds, Khristen stumbles across “an old oil drum, brimming with amputated wings”. A grove of trees is “surprisingly green and freshly pleasant except for the packages of meat dumped there”. What seems to be a livestream of a nesting bird is in fact a recording, the bird having long ago flown into a truck. Part of what makes Williams’s work so destabilising is that agency has almost no significance. Navigating a world that makes no sense, her characters are lost and baffled, their actions and ideas stripped of meaning. These are people who “suspected they were meant to be more or different but fumbled about in the smoky light of half-realised lives”. With free will in question, and the borders between life and death or reality and delusion queasily blurred, individuality itself begins to fray. “Every person,” Williams tells us, “considered themselves unique as snowflakes but in the aggregate they were a blizzard, a whiteout of swirling expectation and denial.” In her remarkable essay Hawk, about a beloved dog that inexplicably attacks her, Williams writes: “Experience is fundamentally illusory. When one is experiencing emotional pain or grief, one feels that everything that happens in life is unreal. And this is a right understanding of life.” Harrow reminds us that, as a consequence of climate collapse, trauma and grief are the condition of our collective existence. As our world disintegrates, it will take what we think of as reality with it. Addressing this in fiction will be the job, partly, of a certain kind of modern mystic. Williams – great virtuoso of the unreal – is one of them. • Harrow by Joy Williams is published by Tuskar Rock in the UK (£14.99) and Australia ($29.99).

251;251;5494;5494;Filipinos count cost of climate crisis as typhoons get ever more destructive;2022-01-05T07:15:35Z;['N/A'];['Global development', 'Philippines', 'Climate crisis', 'Extreme weather', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news', 'Typhoon Haiyan', 'Drought', 'Environment', 'Inequality', 'Internally displaced people', 'Natural disasters'];"A few days before Christmas, Super-typhoon Rai – known locally as Odette – ravaged the Philippines. The morning after the onslaught, on my way back to Iloilo City from San Jose, Antique, I could see the ocean still boiling; houses blown away and great trees knocked down, making roads impassable. The sights were terrifying. Lost lives continue to climb two weeks on. Vast numbers of buildings were destroyed – from houses to schools; food crops lost to flooding. At first, I did not know what to feel – anger, helplessness? Later, I knew what I wanted: climate justice. On average, 20 storms and typhoons hit the Philippines each year and they are growing progressively more destructive. The culprit is greenhouse-gas emissions from human activities. The Philippines contributes less than 0.4% to the climate crisis; the global north is responsible for 92%. The Philippines pays the price for problems produced in the north. In 2019, the Philippines made a strong statement to the world when it sent 1,500 tonnes of illegally dumped rubbish back to Canada. However, Cop26, heralded as the world’s last chance to avert disaster, was seen as a failure by many climate activists. Commitments were not delivered. The final agreement saw a watered-down stand against coal, and prioritised profits over people and the planet.
Despite the Philippines’ small part in the worsening climate crisis, the threat to the country is huge. Rising sea levels from global heating will submerge parts of the country, creating thousands of climate refugees. Drought and flooding will hit agricultural production and destroy ecosystems. The risk and intensity of health emergencies, such as dengue and diarrhoea, will increase.
The Philippine government romanticises the suffering of the affected communities to conceal inefficiency and inaction with its “Filipinos are resilient” rhetoric. When my family and I lived in a slum above a river in Iloilo City, we would leave our shanty houses before a typhoon made a landfall and shelter in a nearby chapel. When the storm had passed, some of us would be grateful to see our houses still standing. Others would be saddened to see theirs blown to bits by the wind or taken by the waves. There was no resiliency here. Families would have to start from scratch, rebuilding their homes, only to see them destroyed again by the next typhoon. We lived in fear and carried the trauma from the danger the calamities posed. On 17 December, I learned that my cousin, a freshly graduated seafarer, was missing with at least 10 other crew members of the tugboat M/V Strong Trinity, after the typhoon hit the port city of Cebu. According to the owners, the boat had sought shelter, but the wind and waves were too strong and washed away the tugboat and those on board. The coastguard has found no trace of the vessel, so far.
Citizens were quick to point to the ill-preparedness of the government, saying it had not learned the lessons from Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, one of the strongest typhoons on record to hit land – despite the fact that this time round there was a system to disseminate information about the storm’s arrival through text messages, social media and on news channels. However, the role of media has been curtailed in the country. The regional stations of the Philippines’ biggest broadcaster, ABS-CBN, which were on the frontline during previous natural disasters, have not been in service since 2020 due to what many see as a politically motivated denial of their franchise renewal. Telecommunications were interrupted. Filipinos were left in the dark waiting for news. People created Facebook groups with updates on the hardest-hit areas, information on missing people, and appeals for help. Facebook news feeds were flooded with posts from those in need. People wandered the streets with signs saying they were hungry and thirsty. Many died of dehydration. Flooded cities have become ghost towns; houses have been buried by landslides. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council has declared a state of emergency in several cities and towns where power and water supplies are still cut off; more than 5.4 million people were affected. More than half a million have been displaced. Last week’s official figures put the death toll at 397 with 1,147 injured and 83 missing. There were more than 535,000 houses destroyed and €350m (£290m) of damage caused to agriculture and infrastructure. People from communities in “danger zones” are unable to return. Despite years of such disasters, natural defences have not been protected. Dams have been built on ecologically important rivers; dolomite mining continues, and new coal-powered plants are still being built. A few days after the typhoon, a four-year ban on open-pit mining was lifted to help economic recovery, disregarding the contribution of mining to the typhoons and rainfall that are battering the economy in the first place. The Philippines has elections in May, when Filipinos must choose a leader who has an unwavering will to tackle the climate crisis by demanding accountability from the global north and strengthening the country’s defences. Poor countries and poor communities remain the victims of anthropogenic climate injustice. The process of ending the human activities responsible is weak and slow; there is only disaster risk-reduction management and mitigation in place.

252;252;5495;5495;Ye, Diana and TikTok: the top documentaries to watch in 2022;2022-01-05T07:15:34Z;['Adrian Horton'];['Documentary films', 'Film', 'Culture', 'Kanye West', 'Music', 'Rihanna'];"As in years past, 2022 promises a trove of documentaries – some still on delayed releases due to the pandemic – about the world’s biggest celebrities, scandals and contemporary forces (namely: TikTok). The coming year will see the unveiling of a Kanye West project 20-plus years in the making, an investigation into the aftermath of two Boeing aircraft due to design flaws, Amy Poehler’s documentary debut on Lucille Ball, and perhaps the premiere of the long-gestating and still-unnamed Rihanna film.
With more sure to be announced in the coming months, here are some of the most anticipated documentaries of 2022: Jeen-yuhs: A Kanye West trilogy
Arguably the most anticipated documentary of the year, Jeen-yuhs culls 20 years of footage from the rapper and producer Ye’s (the name West now goes by) early career in Chicago to provocative (for better or for worse) superstardom into a “documentary trilogy”. Directed by longtime collaborators Coodie & Chike (Clarence “Coodie” Simmons and Chike Ozah, who directed the video for Ye’s debut single, Through the Wire, in 2002, Jeen-yuhs promises never-before-seen footage of Ye’s early career. A first-look clip released in September finds a young Ye and Mos Def trading bars to a camera in New York, 2002. Netflix reportedly paid $30m for the project, which does not involve Ye though did receive his approval for use of the archival material. The Sundance entry will hit streaming at an unannounced date later this year. The Janes
The Janes, an HBO-produced Sundance entry from Tia Lessin and Emma Pildes, revisits the Jane Collective, a clandestine network of women from Chicago who helped women obtain safe, illegal abortions between 1969 and 1973, the year the supreme court guaranteed a woman’s right to an abortion in Roe v Wade. It’s a look into the past – an underground service of safe houses, code names and blindfolds assisting women desperate for help – which could foreshadow a dystopian future of criminalized abortion in the US, as the conservative supreme court appears poised to overturn or at least gut the landmark decision in 2022. Rihanna
Just like her follow-up album to 2016’s Anti, the still-untitled Rihanna documentary by director Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights) appears to be on seemingly permanent delay. The long-gestating project – the film has been in the works for six years and was acquired by Amazon for a whopping $25m in 2019 – has no confirmed release date after the pandemic delayed its initial planned 2020 release until summer 2021, and then again until … who knows. Maybe 2022? Perhaps the extra couple of years allowed Berg to assemble even more footage than the reportedly 1,200 hours he filmed before 2020, during which time the Barbadian singer launched her Fenty beauty line, became the first black woman to head a luxury line for LMVH, debuted her now staple lingerie line Savage x Fenty, started dating fellow musician A$AP Rocky, and maintained global superstardom. Benjamin Franklin
Documentary titan Ken Burns’s latest is a deep dive into one of the most prolific and dynamic Americans of the 18th century: Benjamin Franklin, the writer, printer, philosopher, inventor, diplomat and socialite, a rare transcontinental celebrity in his own time. The two-part, four-hour project, which airs on 4-5 April on PBS, promises to admire Franklin’s life with a critical eye uncommon to biographies of the founding fathers; the logline notes that Franklin’s life was “full of contradictions” – he eventually denounced slavery but owned enslaved people in middle age, he condemned violence against Native Americans but championed white expansion on to indigenous lands. We Need to Talk About Cosby
The comedian and CNN host W Kamau Bell delves into one of the most fraught cultural legacies in recent memory: that of Bill Cosby, the comedian and former television staple convicted of sexual assault in 2018. (Cosby was freed in 2021 after the Pennsylvania supreme court overturned his conviction on a legal technicality; at least 60 women have publicly accused him of sexual assault, often through a sickening pattern of tranquilizing drugs and denial.) According to the logline, Bell’s four-part series, which premieres at Sundance and airs on Showtime on 30 January, incorporates archival material and cultural and political analysis to “reconsider his mark in a society where rape culture, toxic masculinity, capitalism and white supremacy is shaping how we re-evaluate sex, power and agency”. The Occupied City
Award-winning director Steve McQueen’s documentary about Nazi-occupied Amsterdam during the second world war has been in production for several years, and may not be ready by the end of 2022 (no release date has been announced). But anticipation is high for the Oscar winner’s $5.7m-budget film based on the book Atlas van een Bezette Stad, Amsterdam 1940-1945 by McQueen’s wife, the Dutch film-maker and producer Bianca Stigter, whose debuted her own Holocaust-set documentary, Three Minutes: A Lengthening, at the Venice film festival. Downfall: The Case Against Boeing
In October 2018, Lion Air Flight 610, a Boeing 737 Max jet, plunged into the Java Sea minutes after takeoff from Jakarta, killing 189 people. Four months later, another 737 Max, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, crashed six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing 157. Investigators later concluded that malfunctioning automatic flight controls caused the planes to nosedive, and that mentions of recent changes to said system were deleted from pilot training manuals. Downfall: The Case Against Boeing, directed by Rory Kennedy, is the second documentary project to explore the American company’s prioritization of profit over safety in less than a year; the Netflix film follows Boeing’s Fatal Flaw, the PBS Frontline and New York Times collaboration which premiered in September 2021. Kennedy’s film, which premieres at Sundance, will explore the company’s PR crisis in the wake of the disasters. TikTok, Boom
For those looking for a visual deep dive into TikTok’s rapid ascent to the forefront of digital culture, there’s TikTok, Boom, from director Shalini Kantayya. The Sundance entry chronicles TikTok’s rise to prominence from Music.ly to the most downloaded app in the world (owned by the Chinese company ByteDance) and its stupefying forces of virality, through the perspective of Gen Z app users and stars, journalists and experts. Chocobar
The celebrated Argentinian film-maker Lucrecia Martel follows Zama with her first entry into non-fiction: Chocobar, a hybrid fiction-documentary project about the murder of the indigenous Argentinian activist Javier Chocobar by a white landowner in 2007. The film, which Martel has described as “a documentary which is mortally wounded in its pretensions to be a documentary, because the problem in this story is the document”, won the top international prize at the 2020 Locarno film festival’s The Films After Tomorrow Initiative, in Switzerland, for films stalled by the pandemic. No release date has been announced. The Princess
We are reaching peak saturation of Diana content, from the disastrous Diana: The Musical to the critically acclaimed fourth season of The Crown to Kirsten Stewart’s likely Oscar-nominated turn in Pablo Larraín’s surreal Spencer. Now comes Ed Perkins’ The Princess, premiering at Sundance with an HBO Max streaming date to be announced, which purports to examine the life of the People’s Princess and her influence on the public’s view of the monarchy, both during her life and long after her death in 1997. Lucy and Desi
Amy Poehler’s documentary debut, produced by Ron Howard, examines the life of the groundbreaking comedian Lucille Ball and her intense, devoted partnership with husband and I Love Lucy co-star Desi Arnaz. Poehler, who has directed the feature films Wine Country and Moxie, took on her first non-fiction project as a longtime fan of Ball. It was inspired by “her story and what kind of woman she was in business, and what kind of culture she was in when she was making the show”, she told Variety in 2020, as well as the “interesting and complicated and loving” relationship with Arnaz. Here’s hoping reviews are stronger than for last year’s coolly received Being the Ricardos, Aaron Sorkin’s feature starring Nicole Kidman as Ball and (controversially) Spanish actor Javier Bardem as the Cuban American Arnaz.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/documentaries-to-watch-2022;5
253;253;5496;5496;Myanmar: 20 civilians reported killed in latest military attack in rebel hotspot;2022-01-05T07:05:49Z;['N/A'];['Myanmar', 'Myanmar coup'];"Around 20 civilians have been killed and nearly 40 homes destroyed in a Myanmar village, according to local media, the latest in a series of massacres allegedly committed by the military. The victims of the attack in late December were found in the north-eastern Sagaing region, and included four men 60 or older, online news outlet Myanmar Now reported. The military seized power in a coup in February last year, creating a political crisis that has developed into a civil war marked by extreme brutality by security forces.
Sagaing was one of the first areas where civilians rose up in armed rebellion after the military slaughtered hundreds of peaceful protesters. The region has seen armed clashes, multiple massacres and military airstrikes. According to Myanmar Now, the military occupied Natchaung village in late December, with resistance groups compiling a list of victims on 31 December. The year ended with a number of other violent incidents. The military allegedly massacred more than 30 civilians in Kayah State on Christmas Eve, near the border with Thailand, including women, children and two members of international humanitarian organisation Save the Children. While the United Nations called for a “thorough and transparent investigation into the incident”, state media dismissed the reports as a “plot … drawn up based on their whims and fancies”. A spokesperson for the Kayah state police, a revolutionary force formed by officers who defected after the coup, said during a press conference that they had received missing person reports of 42 people, but have confirmed 31 deaths. A doctor said many of the bodies bore signs of torture. Fighting also broke out in Karen state in December after military forces entered territory controlled by an ethnic armed group sympathetic to the pro-democracy movement, arresting political dissidents in hiding. Thousands fled as fighting spread throughout the state, with many seeking refuge in Thailand, where an estimated 6,000 still remain with limited access to basic necessities.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/myanmar-20-civilians-reported-killed-in-latest-military-attack-in-rebel-hotspot;1
254;254;5497;5497;I lost more than £12,000 in a scam and the Co-operative Bank won’t resolve it;2022-01-05T07:00:36Z;['Anna Tims'];['Scams', 'Consumer affairs', 'Consumer rights', 'Money'];I fell victim to a banking scam and reported it to my bank within a couple of hours, but the transactions had already gone through and I have lost £12,650. Four months later, I’m still waiting for my bank, the Co-operative, to decide on a resolution. Without help from my family, I would be destitute. I have been unable to work for a year due to severe depression and anxiety. I’ve been recently diagnosed with autism and am awaiting a claim for the employment and support allowance. I have explained all this to the bank and told them of the distress it is causing. I had hoped the autism diagnosis would help me to understand and tackle my mental health difficulties so that I could work again, but this has smashed my confidence. JK, Newcastle upon Tyne This scam started with a call from a conman pretending to be from the Co-operative Bank’s fraud team, who knew enough of your personal details to trick you into trusting him. Over several hours, he persuaded you to transfer money held with Virgin Money and Halifax to your Co-op account, claiming it would evade a cyber-attack. Virgin blocked the transfer of £10,000. You were therefore told to transfer your £14,720 help-to-buy loan, held with Halifax, in two instalments. The first £10,000 went through, but Halifax blocked the second payment. The Co-op was, apparently, not so vigilant and allowed you to pay the £10,000 transferred from Halifax and the £2,600 already in your savings account to the fraudster. You say you struggle with phone calls because of autism, and it was your parents, who arrived during the call, who realised it was a scam. It’s concerning that the Co-op, unlike the other two banks, did not question this uncharacteristic activity. And it’s woeful that a signatory of the contingent reimbursement model (CRM) code, which pledges to refund blameless fraud victims, has left you in limbo for so long. The code is clear that vulnerable customers, of which you are evidently one, should be repaid in all circumstances. Only when I questioned its adherence to the code did the bank action a refund. It said: “We have apologised and refunded the money, and we will be offering recompense for our delay.” Reader TM wants to know what happens to the money stolen from customers like JK. “If I instruct my bank to pay £20,000 into the scammer’s account, my bank will have a record of the deposit,” he writes. “I’m assuming that the receiving bank will know who owns that account and, once alerted, will be able to act.” One of the reasons the CRM code was agreed in the first place was to incentivise banks to collaborate more effectively to trace stolen funds. A major obstacle is the piecemeal way in which banks communicate with each other. In the US there is an online portal for the purpose – here, they have to rely on email. Fraudsters are cunning. They know the security protocols banks follow, and they know how to get around them. That’s why they evade checks by paying students to allow gang members to use their bank accounts to receive stolen cash. Chances are, your £20,000 would be paid into such an account and then swiftly transferred on through a chain of other accounts, often overseas, until the trail is muddied. It’s also possible for scammers to steal a stranger’s identity and open a bank account in their name, especially since online account applications do not always require physical proof of ID. Enough personal information can be harvested via social media, Companies House, the Land Registry and ancestry websites to impersonate a victim and to satisfy ID checks. Vigilance, by customers as well as by banks, is the only protection, so bear in mind that personal information heedlessly flung into cyberspace can, quite literally, be worth its weight in gold.

255;255;5498;5498;More than 1,000 US public figures aided Trump’s effort to overturn election;2022-01-05T07:00:35Z;['Ed Pilkington'];['Donald Trump', 'US Capitol attack', 'US news', 'US politics', 'World news'];"More than 1,000 Americans in positions of public trust acted as accomplices in Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election result, participating in the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January or spreading the “big lie” that the vote count had been rigged.
The startling figure underlines the extent to which Trump’s attempt to undermine the foundations of presidential legitimacy has metastasized across the US. Individuals who engaged in arguably the most serious attempt to subvert democracy since the civil war are now inveigling themselves into all levels of government, from Congress and state legislatures down to school boards and other local public bodies. The finding that 1,011 individuals in the public realm played a role in election subversion around the 2020 presidential race comes from a new pro-democracy initiative that launched on Wednesday. The Insurrection Index seeks to identify all those who supported Trump in his bid to hold on to power despite losing the election, in the hope that they can be held accountable and prevented from inflicting further damage to the democratic infrastructure of the country. All of the more than 1,000 people recorded on the index have been invested with the public’s trust, having been entrusted with official positions and funded with taxpayer dollars. Many are current or former government employees at federal, state or local levels. Among them are 213 incumbents in elected office and 29 who are running as candidates for positions of power in upcoming elections. There are also 59 military veterans, 31 current or former law enforcement officials, and seven who sit on local school boards. When the index goes live on Thursday, it will contain a total of 1,404 records of those who played a role in trying to overturn the 2020 election. In addition to the 1,011 individuals, it lists 393 organizations deemed to have played a part in subverting democracy. The index is the brainchild of Public Wise, a voting rights group whose mission is to fight for government that reflects the will and the rights of voters. Christina Baal-Owens, the group’s executive director, said that the index was conceived as an ongoing campaign designed to keep insurrectionists out of office. “These are folks who silenced the voices of American voters, who took a validly held election and created fraudulent information to try to silence voters. They have no business being near legislation or being able to affect the lives of American people,” she said. The project has been set up with legal advice from Marc Elias, one of the most influential election lawyers in the US who was Hillary Clinton’s top counsel in the 2016 presidential campaign and who successfully led Joe Biden’s resistance to Trump’s blitzkrieg of lawsuits contesting the 2020 results. Elias told the Guardian that the index was needed urgently to avoid history repeating itself in 2024 or beyond. “We are one, maybe two elections away from a constitutional crisis over election subversion,” he said. “If we don’t recognize who was behind the attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power, then next time we will be less prepared and it may succeed.” Elias said he saw the index as an example of the kinds of robust action progressives need to take to combat an unprecedented wave of anti-democratic legislation emanating from Republicans in the past 12 months. While Trump had reshaped the right to be laser-focused on elections and winning at all costs, Democrats are spreading their energies thinly between a number of causes of which protecting democracy was just one, he said. “The central theme of the Republican party today is undermining free and fair elections. Under Trump that has become a credential within the party, and we can’t let those folks win without a fight because if we do we lose our democracy.” The individuals recorded on the index who are already in public office include the 147 members of Congress who objected to the certification of the 2020 election result. The list also names many elected officials in state legislatures across the nation, including states like Arizona that were ground zero for Trump’s efforts to steal the election from Biden. Jake Hoffman, a lawmaker who represents Arizona’s 12th district, wrote to fellow Republicans a day before the Capitol insurrection urging them to pressure then vice-president Mike Pence into blocking Biden’s victory. “Vice-President Pence has the power to delay congressional certification and seek clarification from state legislatures in contested states as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” Hoffman wrote, reflecting a theory embraced by Trump that has been thoroughly rebutted. The week before the insurrection, 17 Arizona state lawmakers wrote to Pence urging him to “block the use of any Electors from Arizona” despite multiple counts by then establishing that Biden had won the state by more than 10,000 votes. Among the signatories was Mark Finchem, a member of the Arizona House of representatives who was present at Trump’s “stop the steal” rally in Washington on 6 January and who is now vying to become Arizona secretary of state – the top election official who oversees the presidential count. Among the 59 individuals on the index with military backgrounds is Christopher Warnagiris, who in June became the first active-duty member of the armed forces to be charged in relation with the Capitol assault. Despite facing nine counts of assault and violent entry, he has been permitted to continue serving within the training and education section at the Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia. Public Wise has drawn on a number of public information sources to compile the index, working in partnership with other pro-democracy groups who have added specialist skills. The partners include American Oversight, a non-partisan organisation that has used freedom of information laws to extract information from government agencies that exposes participants in the big lie. “The goal is to build up a holistic picture so that nothing can fall through the cracks and no one can slip away,” said Austin Evers, the executive director of American Oversight. “We ask: who is this cc’d on this email? What handle is this on a social media account? If we can connect the dots we can ensure accountability can be brought to bear.” Evers said that the most chilling revelation of the research was that the 6 January insurrection was inspired by an ideology that was supported by people in power. “State legislators in Arizona were involved in the run-up to January 6 and after January 6 used their positions to drive the big lie. That feels cancerous – the attack on democracy has the backing of political, and even governmental, infrastructure.” One likely charge leveled at the new index by rightwing individuals and groups is that it is a form of “cancel culture”, designed to silence anyone airing uncomfortable views. Baal-Owens dismisses any such criticism. “Our call to action is about voting, not doxing,” she said, pointing out that no private information is included on the index. “The call to action is not to show up at this person’s house or chase their child to school, but to allow every registered voter to have an educated way to cast their vote.” The groups behind the index hope that it will alert voters to the anti-democratic actions of people running for elected office. The value of such a record, they believe, would increase exponentially were the Republicans to take back control of Congress in this year’s midterm elections, leading almost certainly to an abrupt halt in congressional investigations into the events of 6 January.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/trump-capitol-attack-democracy-election-insurrection-index;2
256;256;5499;5499;Trump’s ‘cult-like control’ of Republican party grows stronger since insurrection;2022-01-05T07:00:35Z;['David Smith'];['Republicans', 'US politics', 'Donald Trump', 'US Capitol attack', 'US news', 'World news'];"Whether it was praising white supremacists, siding with Vladimir Putin or suggesting bleach as a coronavirus cure, there was nothing that Donald Trump could do to make the Republican party fall out of love with him. Then came 6 January, and – for a brief moment – it seemed that was no longer true. “Today all I can say is: count me out,” said Lindsey Graham, standing in a Senate chamber that just hours earlier had been overrun by a pro-Trump mob determined to overturn the 2020 presidential election. “Enough is enough.”
A week later he was joined by Kevin McCarthy, the Republican minority leader in the House of Representatives, who called on Trump to “accept his share of responsibility” for the deadly violence at the Capitol. Other allies turned against the president. If ever there was a moment that the party could snap out of its five-year fever dream, this was it. Yet it did not. In the year since the insurrection that reverberated around the world, Trump’s stranglehold on Republicans has seemingly become stronger, not weaker. Graham was soon back on the golf course with him; McCarthy was soon kissing the ring at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Many leaders of the party have set about changing the narrative of the insurrection to portray it as a heroic last stand – a new “lost cause”. “We now have a major political party that is embracing violence systematically,” said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington and former White House official. “They’re rewriting the events of January 6. They’re referring, as President Trump does, to these people as patriots. They are stirring up a minority.” Trump was the first president in American history to inspire an attempted coup. After a rally where the defeated incumbent urged supporters to “fight like hell”, the angry mob laid siege to the US Capitol to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. Five people died, scores of police were beaten and bloodied and there was about $1.5m in damage in the first major attack on the Capitol since the war of 1812. More than 700 people have been charged in one of the biggest criminal investigations in American history. But even on the night 6 January, as members of the House and Senate stepped over blood and broken glass to get the job, some 147 Republicans still voted to overturn the election results. It was the first clue that Trump had burrowed too far down into the party’s foundations to be expunged – and that anyone who tried would themselves be purged. The second clue came after Trump had been impeached – for the second time – by the House, a vote in which just 10 Republicans joined Democrats. A majority of senators voted to convict the former president but fell 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority required by the constitution. Trump was acquitted. Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congressman who was the lead impeachment manager, said: “The evidence was so overwhelming, our legal case was so airtight and Trump’s culpability was so plain to see, I thought that perhaps the Republican party would use this as an opportunity to perform an exorcism on their own body. “But Trump just controls way too much money and too much power in the Republican party and it was really only a matter of a week or two before he reasserted his authoritarian, cult-like control over the whole GOP [Grand Old Party] apparatus.”
The third clue, demonstrating Raskin’s point, came in May when Senate Republicans voted down an independent commission to investigate the riot, based on the model of a commission that examined the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Even the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, who had condemned Trump for inciting the violence and remains an arch foe, dismissed the proposed commission as a “purely political exercise”. Democrats instead created a House select committee to examine the events of that day and understand what role Trump played. It has interviewed hundreds of people and is threatening jail time for those who refuse to comply. But it has only two Republican members, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, and their fates say much about the direction of the party. Cheney, vice-chair of the committee and daughter of the former vice-president Dick Cheney, has faced the wrath of the Republican party of Wyoming, which voted to no longer recognise her as a Republican. She will be challenged for her seat in a primary election by a pro-Trump candidate. Kinzinger has been subjected to death threats and will not seek reelection. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: “They have to rewrite the history because that’s the only way they can justify their existence because if you let the actual facts of history speak to the truth of who they are, then I don’t know how they look themselves in the face in the morning.” Today the loudest voices in the Republican party belong to the extremists. For them, Trump’s “big lie” that the election was stolen from him due to voter fraud, rendering Biden an illegitimate president, goes hand in hand with the lie that the insurrection was a morally justified crusade, an righteous endeavor to save democracy, not destroy it. Trump himself perpetuates this through a regular barrage of interviews, rallies and emailed statements since he was barred from Twitter. Notably he has sought to lionize Ashli Babbitt, who was shot dead during the riot, as a martyr. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican congresswoman, has cast rioters currently held in detention in a similar light. In November she visit a Washington jail’s so-called “patriot wing” and complained the inmates were enduring “inhumane” conditions because of their political beliefs. Other pro-Trump Republicans in the House echo these messages – one referred to the Capitol attack as a “normal tourist visit” – or do little to contradict them. Some Republican senators are evidently more uncomfortable with the web of deceit and urge the party to look forward to the next election. But again only a small minority are willing to take Trump on directly. All are aware of the power of rightwing media over state Republican parties and the “Make America great again” base. Fox News host Tucker Carlson produced a three-part documentary, Patriot Purge, for the Fox Nation streaming platform that pushed the bogus claim that the insurrection was a “false flag” operation designed to hurt Trump’s supporters. Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Trump, uses his “War Room” podcast to promote the “big lie” that Trump won re-election in a landslide and features guests such as Mike Lindell, a pillow businessman who peddles wild conspiracy theories. Bannon encourages listeners to support the legal defence of the 6 January “political prisoners”. This has helped fuel a climate in which fealty to Trump and his debunked narrative is a litmus test for Republican candidates for Congress. Almost a third of Republicans believe violence may be necessary to “save” the US, according to a recent poll by the Public Religion Research Institute. Trump’s resilient ability to bend the party to his will, and to his disinformation about election “integrity”, have fueled a drive to make it harder to vote, likely to have a disproportionate impact on Democrats. Between January and October, 19 states enacted 33 laws to restrict voting access, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. In addition, Trump loyalists are running as candidates for secretaries of state and other positions that would give them power over the running of future elections. With Republicans in a strong position to regain control of the House and Senate this year, the party is readying for a repeat of 6 January with a different outcome. Steele added: “The elements of it are being played out in states throughout the country as Republicans rewrite the election laws in their favor.” One year on, many analysts argue that America is now split between a Democratic party and anti-democratic party, the latter being barely recognisable as the one-time home of Abraham Lincoln and Dwight Eisenhower. Instead Trump remains its most powerful and popular figure and could run for the White House again in 2024. Kurt Bardella, an adviser to the Democratic National Committee, believes that 6 January will go down as the day that the Republican party surrendered to “an anti-democratic terrorist cell” and that its mission since has been to permanently undermine democracy. “I have long said that January 6 was merely a dress rehearsal for how Republicans intend to try to hijack free and fair democratic elections in this country going forward,” added Bardella, a former Republican congressional aide. “They know that when the playing field is level and everybody can participate in the democratic process, they cannot win, so the only recourse that they believe that they can obtain power is by throwing out democratic norms and overthrowing elections, even if that means using instruments of violence, fear and terror to do so.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/donald-trump-republican-party-capitol-attack-insurrection;3
257;257;5500;5500;Fossil fuel firms among biggest spenders on Google ads that look like search results;2022-01-05T07:00:35Z;['Niamh McIntyre'];['Google', 'Climate crisis', 'Fossil fuels', 'ExxonMobil', 'Shell', 'Aramco', 'Goldman Sachs'];"Fossil fuel companies and firms that work closely with them are among the biggest spenders on ads designed to look like Google search results, in what campaigners say is an example of “endemic greenwashing”. The Guardian analysed ads served on Google search results for 78 climate-related terms, in collaboration with InfluenceMap, a thinktank that tracks the lobbying efforts of polluting industries. The results show that over one in five ads seen in the study – more than 1,600 in total – were placed by companies with significant interests in fossil fuels. Advertisers pay for their ads to appear on the search engine when a user queries certain terms. The ads are appealing to businesses because they are very similar in appearance to search results: more than half of users in a 2020 survey reported they could not tell the difference between a paid-for listing and a normal Google result. ExxonMobil, Shell, Aramco, McKinsey, and Goldman Sachs were among the top-20 advertisers on the search terms, while a number of other fossil fuel producers and their financiers also placed ads. Jake Carbone, senior data analyst at InfluenceMap, said: “Google is letting groups with a vested interest in the continued use of fossil fuels pay to influence the resources people receive when they are trying to educate themselves. “The oil and gas sector has moved away from contesting the science of climate change and now instead seeks to influence public discussions about decarbonisation in its favour.” Oil major Shell’s ads – 153 were counted in total – appeared on 86% of searches for “net zero”. Many promoted its pledge to become a net zero company by 2050 and align itself with a 1.5C warming target.
However, Shell’s net-zero strategy relies heavily on carbon capture and offsetting, according to a Carbon Brief analysis, which says: “Despite its ‘highly ambitious’ framing … Shell’s vision of a continued role for oil, gas and coal until the end of the century remains essentially the same.” A spokesperson for Shell said: “Shell’s target is to become a net zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. Our short, medium and long-term intensity and absolute targets are consistent with the more ambitious 1.5C goal of the Paris agreement.” Goldman Sachs, which facilitated nearly $19bn of lending to the fossil fuel industry in 2020, had the third highest number of ads. The bank’s ads appeared on almost six in 10 searches for “renewable energy”, with many emphasising its “continued commitment to sustainable finance”. Consulting firm McKinsey’s ads appeared on more than eight in 10 searches for “energy transition” and four in 10 searches for “climate hazards”. Its ads stated: “McKinsey works with clients on innovation & growth that advances sustainability.” Alongside its work on sustainable investing, the company receives significant income from fossil fuel clients. In recent years McKinsey has advised 43 out of the world’s 100 most polluting companies, according to the New York Times. A spokesperson for McKinsey pointed to an op-ed written by a managing partner at the company, which states: “There is no way to deliver emissions reductions without working with these industries to rapidly transition.” Aramco, the state-owned Saudi oil company, which is the world’s largest oil exporter, had 114 ads on the keywords “carbon storage”, “carbon capture” and “energy transition”. A number of their ads claimed the company “promoted biodiversity” and “protected the planet”.
Melissa Aronczyk, an associate professor at Rutgers University, said: “Since at least the 1980s in the US, there has been a very concerted effort by public relations agents to help polluting companies develop strategies to ‘go green’ while maintaining business as usual. “Many of the initiatives companies are taking are very piecemeal and will not amount to any kind of long-term or systemic change.” Johnny White, a lawyer at environmental charity ClientEarth, called for stronger regulation of adverts placed by polluting industries. “Fossil fuel companies spend millions on incredibly sophisticated advertising campaigns, so sorting fact from fiction can be really tricky for the public. “Damaging greenwashing has become endemic – to stamp it out we need to legislate bans on all fossil fuel advertisements, just like what happened with tobacco.” The analysis also looked at “snippets”, which are not paid-for but are chosen by Google’s algorithm as the most relevant result. The Guardian found the snippet chosen for “fracking” linked to the website of an oil and gas lobby group, the Independent Petroleum Association of America.
In answer to the question: “Is fracking a threat to public health?”, the IPAA page states: “No. In fact, there is ample evidence that increased natural gas use … has improved public health by dramatically improving air quality in recent years.” A years-long piece of research by the US Environmental Protection Agency concluded in 2016 that in some cases fracking had harmed drinking water supplies. Unlike Facebook, Google does not have a publicly accessible ad library, meaning it is difficult to analyse advertising on the platform. In the EU and UK, Google only provides comprehensive data on ads which directly mention politicians or a political party, or those which feature a referendum question. A spokesperson for Google said: “We recently launched a new policy that will explicitly prohibit ads promoting climate change denial. This policy applies to all advertisers, including energy companies and financial institutions, and we will block or remove any ads that contain violating content. “When search ads do appear, they have the word “Ad” clearly labeled in bold black text in the current design. We rely on extensive user testing both on mobile and desktop to ensure ad labels meet our high standards for being prominent and distinguishable from unpaid results.” A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said: “ExxonMobil has contributed to the development of climate science for decades and has made its work publicly available. And as the scientific community’s understanding of climate change developed, ExxonMobil responded accordingly.” Aramco and Goldman Sachs did not respond to requests for comment. • This article was amended on 6 January 2022 to add a response from Google relating to search ads that was received after publication.";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/05/fossil-fuel-firms-among-biggest-spenders-on-google-ads-that-look-like-search-results;3
258;258;5501;5501;Tree-mendous news: noisy gas-powered leaf blowers banned in Washington DC;2022-01-05T07:00:34Z;['Oliver Milman'];['Washington DC', 'US news', 'Environment'];"A roaring and often harmful cacophony that has long afflicted Washington DC has finally been silenced. Not the roar of politicians sounding off, alas, but the use (and sale) of gasoline-powered leaf blowers, banned since New Year’s Day. Anyone using the blowers, which have been blamed for ear-splitting noise and a stew of air pollution, risks a fine of up to $500.
People who still want to rearrange the natural fall of leaves from trees have been offered rebates for quieter electric blowers. The push to ban gas leaf blowers was led by local resident James Fallows, a former speechwriter for Jimmy Carter who has blamed the anti-social implements for producing “the secondhand smoke of this era”. It is just the latest crackdown on leaf blower use across the US. Last year, Gavin Newsom, governor of California, signed a law prohibiting gasoline-powered lawn equipment, including leaf blowers and lawnmowers, from 2024. More than 100 cities in various states have already banned gas leaf blowers, with Dallas and Portland the latest major urban areas to mull new restrictions. The use of gas-powered leaf blowers is deleterious, opponents argue, due to their toxic emissions and ruination of neighborhood harmony. The blowers typically use two-stroke engines, an outmoded design that can produce up to 100 decibels of low-frequency noise, around the same as a plane taking off. This has led to concerns regarding hearing loss and tinnitus for users. The inefficiency of such engines also causes enormous levels of air pollution: a 2011 study found that just 30 minutes of using a leaf blower in the yard can emit the same amount of hydrocarbons as driving a pickup truck from Texas to Alaska. Michael Leamy, an expert in mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech, said the amount of air pollution from such a relatively small device was “astounding”. “Homeowners will use them occasionally but mostly we are talking about people from lower socio-economic backgrounds working in landscaping who are exposed to these pollutants, which are very harmful to human health,” Leamy said. “These are very dirty, crude engines compared to the engine you will find in a modern car. The government should really step in to protect the workers dealing day in, day out with the air pollution and hearing loss caused by these leaf blowers.” Regulators in Washington DC sent out notices to lawn and building maintenance companies last summer, warning of the upcoming change and pointing out that residents are able to file complaints online, along with photographic or video evidence, if they see gas leaf blowers used. The change will require a major shift for most landscapers, said Nancy Sainburg, founder of the Enchanted Garden landscape company, which operates in Washington. “Hardly anyone is using electric leaf blowers,” she said, “and I have no idea what enforcement will be like, will people rat out their own neighbors? “I mean it’s DC, so probably.” Sainburg switched her own workforce to electric blowers five years ago, after, she said, becoming fed up with the smell of gasoline on her clothes and company trucks. “The electric ones are just as powerful as gas blowers, you charge them overnight and just go for it,” she said. “My crew doesn’t get sick like they used to, they don’t get respiratory issues like they used to, they love it. “These blowers don’t make the big stupid noise of the gas ones, it’s more like a vacuum cleaner noise. I think they are great.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/gas-leaf-blowers-banned-washington-dc;7
259;259;5502;5502;I was sure my parenting had made our baby’s first flight go smoothly. Then came the return trip | Arwa Mahdawi;2022-01-05T07:00:34Z;['Arwa Mahdawi'];['Parents and parenting', 'Children', 'Flights', 'Travel', 'Family', 'Life and style', 'Society'];"On New Year’s Eve, my wife and I locked ourselves in a tiny British Airways bathroom and frantically pulled off items of clothing. It would have been a pretty exciting way to see off 2021, were it not for the fact that the clothes belonged to our seven-month-old, who had decided to do an enormous poo at 30,000 feet. I had had a little chat with the child before the flight and told her Mummy and Mummy would appreciate it if she held off on any major bowel movements while we were in the air, but she didn’t cooperate. Babies, I have learned, are not very good at listening. They are good at screaming, though. At least, my kid is. She has always had a good set of lungs on her, but, my God, screams reach a whole new decibel level when you are squeezed into cattle class on a plane, surrounded by people who are quietly judging you. So, I would like to extend an apology to everyone on BA175 from London to New York last Friday who may be experiencing mild PTSD after seven hours of being trapped with the high-pitched squeals and shrieks – interspersed with grunts and farts – of my darling demon child. My wife and I had not approached our first big trip with a child lightly. We had spent days researching how to take a child on a plane without making your fellow passengers want to murder you. We had brought along an array of soothing toys and teethers; we had bought a fancy little tent that you stick over your baby to lull them to sleep. On our way to London, this had worked like a dream. As I kept telling the lovely flight attendant, who popped by every few minutes to check on us and mutter: “Oh dear,” our baby was not normally this cranky – she had been an angel on the first flight of her life. I had got all smug, thinking I had this whole parenting thing down. Ha! Ha! HA! If I have learned anything during my short time being a mum, it is that you should never be smug. The moment you think you have everything figured out, your child will very loudly put you in your place. Another lesson I have learned painfully? Bring several changes of clothes with you everywhere. A few hours into our flight from hell, I spilled dry baby formula all over myself. This was stressful – you don’t want to have an Arabic name and arrive at US immigration covered in mysterious white powder. I decided to deal with the stress via the medium of chocolate. I looked around for the little pot of aeroplane pudding I had set aside earlier. Then I discovered that I was sitting on it. It had exploded all over my trousers. An organised mum would have had something clean to change into. I just sat in my chocolatey, formula-specked trousers and wished myself dead. I reckon a fair few other passengers wished the same; no one wants to sit in the vicinity of a “lively” baby. A few years ago, there was even a trend for parents to hand out goody bags on planes as penance for procreating; on a flight in 2017, Amal and George Clooney gave noise-cancelling headphones to their fellow first-class passengers, in case their six-month-old twins started crying. Sorry, but bribe bags are not the answer. We need to find a better way for babies to fly. Maybe we could stick them in the hold, as we do with pets? Only joking; I am not a monster. I would never put my dog in the hold. Anyway, I am afraid I don’t have any answers when it comes to improving the in-flight experience. I have only apologies. Lots of apologies. Sorry, once again, to my fellow passengers. But, however bad it was for you, let me assure you that it was much, much worse for me. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/05/i-was-sure-my-parenting-had-made-our-babys-first-flight-go-smoothly-then-came-the-return-trip;5
260;260;5503;5503;A moment that changed me: Ben Okri – realising my dream to become a novelist at the age of 19;2022-01-05T07:00:34Z;['Ben Okri'];['Books', 'Life and style', 'Culture', 'Poetry', 'Nigeria', 'Fiction', 'Short stories', 'Africa'];"Family legend has it that I began reading the Times at around the age of four. At school in London I was that kid who stuck his hand up to read aloud from the Shakespeare play we were studying or to recite a poem. At secondary school, in Nigeria, literature was something I was negligently good at, but didn’t take seriously. Over the holidays I would visit the libraries of foreign embassies and read my way through their literatures. At the American embassy, I discovered Emerson and Whitman; at the Japanese embassy, I discovered karate, Zen Buddhism and Bashō. It seemed then I was destined to be a scientist. I applied to university, but at age 14 was deemed too young. I spent a year at home, waiting to be old enough. My main task, during that year, was to dust my father’s library. I was to dust the books but not read them. The first book to catch my attention was Plato’s Symposium. I had a great thirst for philosophy and devoured all his dialogues. I read the plays of Ibsen, Shaw, Shakespeare; the short stories of Maupassant, Chekhov, Maugham; then I got lost in 19th-century novels. Like everyone else, I read American and English thrillers. They were a bad influence in every way except one: they made writing seem deceptively easy. We lived then in a place called Mile Twelve. There was poverty all around us. We had lived in a more genteel part of Lagos, but now we lived on the outskirts. They say three things make you a writer: childhood illness, a fall in your parent’s lifestyle, and encounter with death early in life. I had experienced them all. Solitude is terrible for an adolescent but invaluable for learning to think for yourself. While my generation was dancing at the most wasteful national jamboree after the end of the civil war, I was in a ghetto learning to write. My father became a lawyer for the poor. It was the best education a young writer could ask for, to see the truth of society in the raw. I began with poetry. I wrote a hundred love poems and burned all except five. Then something happened that plugged my writing into the nerve of life. The ghetto landlords had unlimited powers. They could throw families with all their possessions out into the street. I was so outraged at seeing this happen that I wrote an article about it for the Evening Times. To my amazement it was published. Encouraged, I wrote about other injustices. Those pieces were not published. Then it occurred to me to write a story about them. Two of the stories were published in women’s magazines. This began my long adventure in the rigorous craft of the short story. Then one of the short stories grew and grew, and became a novel. By this time I had finished my A-levels and had a job working for a paint company. Traffic in Lagos was so atrocious that it took three hours to get to work. I would wake up at four o’clock in the morning and write for an hour before setting out for work. When I returned, I would sleep and then write till one o’clock. I was always dozing on the long bus ride to the office. The first draft took a year. I got myself fired from work and bought a typewriter and a camera with the severance pay. I then worked as a reporter for a news magazine. In the autumn of 1978 I came to London to study. I came really to write. All my colleagues dreamed of America, but my sentimental attachment was to the England of my childhood. I brought my typewriter, camera and the first draft of my first novel. I read my way through the literature of Africa and the world. I made notes. I began re-writing. This was at my uncle’s house in New Cross. I sent the manuscript to many publishers, who all turned it down. Then, one morning, a letter came from Longmans’ African Writers’ Series. I remember giving a cry of joy. That moment changed everything. I was 19. With the publication of Flowers and Shadows, the life I was meant to live began. Every Leaf a Hallelujah, an environmental fable for children and adults, is published by Head of Zeus (£14.99).";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/05/a-moment-that-changed-me-ben-okri-realising-my-dream-to-become-a-novelist-at-the-age-of-19;5
261;261;5504;5504;Where tourists seldom tread: 6 great British places not in the guidebooks;2022-01-05T07:00:34Z;['Chris Moss'];['United Kingdom holidays', 'Cultural trips', 'City breaks', 'Short breaks', 'Travel'];"Warrington It’s not so much a mist as a murk, a weakness of light due to the late season and lowering sky. Mirroring the grasping hands of wintry trees are bare branches plunged into still water, in turn reflected there. I think of flooded forests on the upper Amazon. I’m in Warrington. If the juxtaposition seems silly or funny, that’s not my problem. I’ve come to take a circular walk along the Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal, two great watercourses almost universally ignored – certainly by travel writers and tourist boards and, from the evidence of the empty footpaths, by Warringtonians too. It’s a Saturday afternoon. No doubt the locals are largely seated beside their hearths, perhaps reading the glossy supplements, surfing the net, wondering over a holiday away from the pandemic pandemonium and the pall of December. Most of the travel we choose is chosen for us – at best by past adventurers, more usually by tour firms devoted to cliche and consumption. I’d bet Warrington is less attractive to most British passport holders than Ulaanbaatar, Bilbao or Cancún – despite those places being, respectively, poorer, more industrialised, more dangerous. Capitalism, the Crap Towns crowd and all those unfunny-as-hell websites have made much of the UK unfashionable, undesirable and uncool.
Yet a minimal effort uncovers Warrington’s secrets: the statue of Cromwell, whose forces overcame the Duke of Hamilton’s Royalists and Scots in 1648; the Academy, where Joseph Priestley, discoverer of oxygen, worked and which once made the town the “Athens of the North”; the Bank Quay factories that turned us into a nation of sweet-scented soap users; one of the UK’s last transporter bridges; and Warrington Bridge itself, on the old Roman road, once a portal to a swampy nowhere, then to Northumbria, Lancashire and, post-1974, a dubious corner of Cheshire.
As for the walk, well, you get to see the glorious Mersey, which meanders wildly here at its shallowest stretch; the Woolston Cut (now an ecology trail) was built to shave off a great loop. You see the ship canal, the precursor to those of Panama and Suez (where you’d no doubt love to take a holiday). I see a cormorant skimming, a stork rising like an old C-54 Skymaster from nearby Burtonwood, and a huge raft of tufted ducks by the weir, dabbling and drifting. I hear the hum of the M6; transport is everywhere in the north-west. Above all, I feel, in the gloom-hued canal, the rushing river, and in the great iron girders and steel spans of rail and road bridges, the weight and tow and flow of history. At the Barley Mow pub, built in 1561 and a rare Tudor trinket in a town obsessed with rebranding, regeneration and, above all, demolition, I toast Warrington’s wonderful absence from Unesco’s or any other sappy heritage list. Overtourism? It’s not a problem. It’s just you, on your holidays, with everyone else. Blackburn and Darwen
Mill towns would have done well to keep more of their mills. On Gorse Street, Blackburn, Imperial Mill, built in 1901, is a redbrick beauty. It would have been truly wondrous if they hadn’t felled the chimney in 1958. The facade of Waterfall Mill on Peel Street is lofty and dignified. Again, no chimney. Like a house without windows. No hope of resurrection. I walk the A666 (the Devil’s Highway – perhaps the road where the “4,000 holes” of A Day in the Life pocked the blacktop) into Darwen, and stop at the junction with Spring Gardens. India Mill still has its chimney, at more than 92 metres one of the tallest in Lancashire; today the building’s “open plan suites are available for office, leisure and storage”. Better than the wrecking ball, anyway. Such solidity, such fearless symmetry: I am more moved by textile mills than by any Taj Mahal or Angkor Wat. Why? Because their shadows are internal and external, and if you are a northerner, that’s where you still walk. If you are a southerner, consider: these paid for your gherkins and your cheese graters.
Long before he became a national treasure cum caricature associated with the Cumbrian fells and other hiker honeypots, Alfred Wainwright was an anonymous Blackburn native, Rovers supporter and tramper of the less-exalted heights of Darwen Hill and the lowland pastures of the Ribble Valley. A 126-mile Wainwright’s Way, devised by guide and author Nick Burton, links Blackburn to Buttermere: a journey from truth to fiction. If you’re after a shorter ramble, try the 4.5 mile walk, by way of the Wainwright Memorial (and troposcope, a directional circle giving distances to landmarks) on the Yellow Hills. On a clear day you can see the summits of the mountains the great man would scribble about and sketch. According to Panorama in 2007 and again in 2018 – someone had a point to make – Blackburn is Britain’s most divided town. But the fact that this city is 27% Muslim surely makes it fascinating as well as fractious. Clock the 30-odd mosques, with their minarets – their chimneys for the djinn, perhaps. Morocco has been a must-visit destination for too long; do something original, swap the Atlas mountains for the west Pennines, and visit your very own Marrakech-on-the-Moors. Surbiton
One of the strangest things about the London hipsterati is that they haven’t moved on from The Good Life (1975-8). Still, they insist, “Surbiton, bah, boring, square, Surrey.” Though filmed in Northwood, north-west London, the TV series was set in a fictional Surbiton – a byword back then for middle-class commuterland. The name even looks like “suburb”. But it was a joke, or perhaps a trick to fool the obtuse. For this Thames-side town in London’s zone six harbours more easily accessible joys than many supposedly happening districts in the capital’s inner boroughs – and it does so with none of the gloating self-satisfied superiority of nearby Richmond, Kew, Barnes and Wimbledon. The landmarks start as soon as you alight, for Surbiton station is a poem in reinforced concrete. Built by James Robb Scott in the 1930s in art deco style, its straight lines and whitewashed plainness suggest both an Odeon cinema and a mausoleum. Stepping away from this portal to the Smoke, we soon find ourselves on leafy lanes and stately avenues lined by lofty Georgian townhouses, Victorian terraces (the St Andrew’ Square Conservation Area could grace Belgravia), 30s deco-influenced blocks and to-be-expected Tudorbethan detached houses. Village-type pubs and restaurants punctuate the quietly elegant residential streets. This continues all the way through the Seething Wells area – an unhappy corruption of the original name, Soothing Wells – to the marina and riverside, where a path leads to Kingston, across the bridge, and into Home Park – the nicest of the royal parks, with ancient meadows, floodplain ecosystems, a superb fallow deer herd and the Long Water – the original neighbour-impressing “water feature”, built by Charles II in 1660 as a wedding gift for bride-to-be Catherine of Braganza. Hampton Court is at the far end of the geometrical pool, should you wish to join in the melee of stately home-ites and Wolf Hall fans. Birkenhead
Visitors to Liverpool swarm to the waterfront to see the Three Graces, but they are so big, so imposing and so close that they lead only to neck cricks and distorted photographs. Look, instead, to the muddy, maudlin Mersey – so quiet these days – and the strange oblong on the opposite bank. It looks like a Modernist church. That is where you should go to pray and meditate on Liverpool. The Pier Head–Woodside ferry runs at peak times Monday to Friday, costs £3.70 return, and takes about 10 minutes to cross. First stop is the church – that is, the Grade II-listed Woodside Ventilation Station, drawing fumes from the Queensway tunnel as its giant fans push fresh air underground. Designed by Herbert Rowse (also responsible for Liverpool’s Philharmonic Hall and India Buildings) and built between 1925 and 34, it’s a brilliant expression of form meeting function.
Rowse’s Sidney Street and Taylor Street shaft buildings are also on the Wirral and also in staid brown brick, while the better-known George’s Dock building across the water is in Portland stone. If you need a stretch of legs, the East Wirral coastal trail is awash with maritime memories, from the Camell Laird shipyard, to the U-boat Story (currently being refurbished), to the (probable) steps and jetty of Job’s Ferry – the 12th-century precursor of the trans-Mersey service to “the place I love”. A few paces inland are Birkenhead Priory – the oldest building on Merseyside – and the Georgian masterpiece that is Hamilton Square, second only to Trafalgar Square for the number of Grade I-listed buildings on a single site. Birkenhead Park, opened in 1847, was the first park to be built with public money. It was laid out by Joseph Paxton, best known for work at Chatsworth House, and offers native and exotic trees, lodges, ponds, rock gardens, serpentine paths, bridges, a cricket crease, “probably the oldest brick-built cricket pavilion in the world” and a boathouse. American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, visiting in 1850, took ideas from Birkenhead when designing Central Park in New York. Wrexham
Wrexham confounds English notions about Wales – the fantasy island of Merlin and Arthurian myth, the unpeopled Green Desert, and laughingly tying one’s tongue over Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. It’s six miles from the English border – and there is a sense that it might have been better off if it could shirk off the old yoke and shift farther into Cymru. The most purist form of tourism is to travel in search of nothing, whether that’s a colourful version of empty spaces (Patagonia, Death Valley, the central Asian steppe) or a ghost of what has been. Wrexham, from the latter viewpoint, is quite remarkable, a veritable Paris of what is lost. Highlights of the missed include the former police station, a Brutalist masterpiece that was razed in November 2020; the mock Tudor vegetable market, demolished to make way for a BHS, now also extinct; Manchester, Birmingham and Yorkshire Squares, where trading in textiles, hardware and leather from those respective regions took place.
The General Market (formerly the Butter Market, for dairy produce), built in 1879 in the famous Ruabon brick of this area, is the last edifice to evoke the glory days of Wrexham as a commercial hub. With plans to demolish the old Rhosddu vicarage and 18th-century Moreton pub – despite local protests – the “capital of north Wales” seems anxious to keep emphasising the “wreck” in Wrexham. As they say in the guidebooks, go before it’s gone.
Outside town, things are somewhat more enduring. Clywedog Valley Trail is an easy 5½-mile walk from the 18th-century Kingsmill corn mill (recently saved by a community fundraiser) at the south-east edge of town to the Minera Lead Mines and country park. Do a detour to pay a visit to the National Trust-managed Erddig Hall, a 1,200-acre country park and 18th-century pile. Wrexham is east of Offa’s Dyke, but it’s well worth the trip out to visit this section, as it includes the Unesco-listed Pontcysyllte aqueduct, which carries the Llangollen canal over the steep-sided valley of the River Dee. Elephant & Castle, London
As Brian, an old friend of mine and long-term resident of the Elephant, likes to say, his barrio is the centre of London. He points me, and everyone else, to the obelisk at Saint George’s Circus – erected in 1771 – where it is clearly announced in stone that it is “One Mile” and a bit to Fleet Street, Palace Yard in Westminster or London Bridge. But don’t dash off to those well-trodden sites. For the 21st century is happening right here: like it or loathe it, few areas of Britain can compare for scale or style of reinvention. Two decades ago, Elephant and Castle could, for most people, be summed up as two teeming (and, for cyclists, lethal) roundabouts, one ugly yet quirky shopping centre, and urine-perfumed underpasses to test even the most avid of urban psychogeographers. While tourists happily went to Brixton, Clapham Common, even dull old Dulwich, their main interest in Elephant was the fine range of bus services to other places. But dig a little and the Elephant reveals its tender verities. The Pullens buildings are among the last few remaining Victorian tenements extant in London, which removed thousands of properties during slum clearances in the 1920s and 30s. Behind the elegant terraces are cobbled yards where studios and workshops clang and whoosh to the postindustrial sounds of 3D printers and digital cameras, and neo-artisans and crafters making floral arrangements, ceramics and woodwork.
This district is home to London’s largest Latin quarter, with hundreds of residents originally from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru and about 150 Latin American small businesses selling anything from tasty ground-maize arepas to classes in salsa dancing or English and Spanish language. Like other residents, they lamented the recent demolition of the Elephant & Castle shopping centre – not for them a symbol of urban decay, but of home from home. The Strata SE1 residential tower (with its famous non-functioning wind turbines), 15-storey Vantage building (one-beds at £1,425 pcm) and the yuppifying of Metro Central Heights, designed by Ernő Goldfinger and formerly occupied by the Department of Health and Social Security, signal a different future. Elephant, once known as the “Piccadilly of south London” for its commercial, retail and entertainment offering, is joining the rest of Alpha-City London on the high road to hyper-gentrification.

262;262;5505;5505;Kazakhstan protests: government resigns amid rare outbreak of unrest;2022-01-05T06:54:19Z;['Shaun Walker'];['Kazakhstan', 'South and central Asia', 'World news'];"Kazakhstan’s president has accepted the resignation of the government, hours after he declared a state of emergency in large parts of the country in response to a rare outbreak of unrest. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has appointed Alikhan Smailov as acting prime minister, the president’s office said early on Wednesday. Smailov was previously the first deputy prime minister. The political moves follow protests, sparked by rising fuel prices, that began in the west of the country over the weekend and have spread quickly. On Tuesday evening, video footage from Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, showed lines of riot police and numerous crowd control vehicles massed in the centre of the city. Police used stun grenades and teargas after crowds refused to disperse, AFP reported, estimating there were more than 5,000 people present. Later, there were unverified reports of police cars on fire in Almaty, and videos from a number of other cities appeared to show protesters braving subzero temperatures and a large presence of security forces.
Mobile internet was down and messaging apps were blocked across large parts of the authoritarian Central Asian nation. “All calls to storm or attack government buildings are absolutely illegal,” Tokayev said in a video address on Tuesday evening. In a tweet, Tokayev blamed the protests on “destructive individuals who want to undermine the stability and unity of our society”. In an attempt to quell the unrest, however, he said the government would meet on Wednesday to discuss “the socio-economic demands” of protesters. Late on Wednesday, he imposed a state of emergency covering Almaty and the western Mangystau province, which is due to last for two weeks. The protests began over the weekend in the oil city of Zhanaozen, the same place where, in December 2011, police fired on protesters killing at least 16 people. The initial spark for outrage was the sharply rising price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), used by many to power their cars, particularly in the west of Kazakhstan. The price doubled in a matter of days.
Tokayev said the government would introduce a price cap of 50 tenge (about 8p) a litre on LPG, roughly half the current market price, in Mangystau province. Speaking to acting cabinet members, Tokayev ordered them and provincial governors to broaden the LPG price controls to gasoline, diesel and other “socially important” consumer goods. He also ordered the government to develop a personal bankruptcy law and consider freezing utilities’ prices and subsidising rent payments for poor families. He said the situation was improving in protest-hit cities and towns after the state of emergency was declared which included a curfew and movement restrictions. Tokayev is the handpicked successor of Nursultan Nazarbayev, a Soviet-era Communist boss who became Kazakhstan’s first leader after independence and ruled for nearly three decades until he stepped down in 2019. The 81-year-old still wields enormous power behind the scenes, and the country’s capital city was renamed Nur-Sultan in his honour in 2019. Under Nazarbayev and his successor, a small elite have amassed enormous wealth, while life for many ordinary Kazakhs is still hard-going, particularly in the resource-rich west of the country. Rare protests have been ruthlessly crushed, and the regime faces no real opposition in parliament. Separately, the interior ministry said that in addition to Almaty, government buildings were attacked in the southern cities of Shymkent and Taraz overnight, with 95 police officers wounded in clashes. Police have detained more than 200 people.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/kazakhstan-president-declares-state-of-emergency-in-protest-hit-areas;1
263;263;5506;5506;Omicron fuels India third wave as Mumbai prepares for ‘tsunami’ of Covid cases;2022-01-05T06:36:46Z;['Hannah Ellis-Petersen'];['India', 'Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Science', 'South and central Asia', 'World news'];"India is in the midst of a Covid third wave, officials have said, as the spread of Omicron has led to a doubling of cases in recent days and curfews being imposed on cities across the country. “India is clearly in the third wave of Covid-19, and the whole thing seems driven by Omicron,” said Dr N K Arora, chairman of the Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, who cited the “galloping increase” of cases seen over the past week as evidence. Officially, India has detected 1,892 Omicron cases but Arora said that Omicron probably now accounted for around 50% of the new Covid cases in urban areas, overtaking Delta as the dominant variant. In Delhi, 84% of sequenced cases were found to be the Omicron variant. The highest concentration of Omicron cases are in Delhi and Mumbai. On Wednesday, Delhi experienced a 94% increase in new cases from the previous day while in Mumbai, the mayor Kishori Pednekar said the city was preparing for a “tsunami” of cases. The metropolis is now registering over 15,000 new cases a day and Pednekar warned that if it hit 20,000, they were likely to impose a lockdown.
The central government has advised all states to reactivate their Covid war rooms and strengthen health infrastructure, particularly around oxygen supply and hospital bed capacity. In Delhi, 40% of hospital beds have now been reserved for Covid patients as the government announced a weekend curfew. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was among those who tested positive for the virus, a day after he had attended an election rally without a mask. The states of Punjab and Bihar have also imposed night curfews. Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organisation, warned that “India could have a big surge. The next two weeks will tell us.”
Swaminathan warned people not to be complacent about the virus, which still had the potential to overwhelm India’s healthcare system, even if it was milder than the Delta variant, adding that it was “not the common cold”. Currently 64% of India’s adult population is fully vaccinated, while 90% have had one shot, mostly of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. However, the government has been criticised for its failure to start rolling out booster shots quicker in the wake of omicron, which have been seen as crucial in other countries to preventing the spread and hospitalisation from the virus. From next week, vulnerable people, healthcare workers and those over 60 in India will be eligible for boosters. Arora was among those making assurances that the third wave was unlikely to be as brutal and devastating as the second wave which hit India in April,which pushed the healthcare system to collapse, led to a nationwide shortage of oxygen and overwhelmed crematoriums due to the scale of the dead. He pointed to the situation in South Africa, where there were a high number of cases as Omicron spread quickly through communities, but where most cases were mild or asymptomatic. The wave has now almost died down after a month. Arora said that the high seroprevalence in India from previous exposure to the virus – which in Delhi was as high as 97% – could also help curb the impact of the third wave. “In view of this, we may see a somewhat similar pattern in India as far as the third wave is concerned,” Arora told Press Trust India. “Looking at the behaviour of the Covid infection in the last seven to 10 days in India, I feel that we may be in for a third wave peak very soon.” In Goa, which had held off introducing any restrictions to avoid hurting the already beleaguered tourism industry, the state’s Directorate of Health Services said the third wave had hit the state on 28 December. Just days later, around New Year’s Eve, beaches in north Goa teemed with crowds of tens of thousands of people, leading to fears of a huge surge in cases in coming days. Over 1,800 double vaccinated revellers, mainly from Mumbai, Delhi and Gujarat, who were on a New Year party cruise from Mumbai to Goa were held on the ship after over 200 of them tested positive. Everyone on board was prevented from disembarking by the Goa authorities after an initial 66 were found to be positive and the boat was sent back to Mumbai, where an additional 143 people were found to have been infected. All the Covid positive passengers were taken into institutional quarantine in Mumbai.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/omicron-fuels-india-third-wave-as-mumbai-prepares-for-tsunami-of-cases;7
264;264;5507;5507;World’s largest coal port to be 100% powered by renewable energy;2022-01-05T06:34:05Z;['Royce Kurmelovs'];['Fossil fuels', 'New South Wales', 'Australia news', 'Energy', 'Environment'];"The world’s largest coal port has announced it will now be powered entirely by renewable energy. The announcement from Port of Newcastle comes as coal power generation in Australia’s national electricity market fell to its lowest level in the final three months of 2021. Though the port continues to export an average of 165Mt of coal a year, the move is part of a plan to decarbonise the business by 2040, and to increase the non-coal portion of its business so that coal only makes up half its revenue by 2030. It has signed a deal with Iberdrola, which operates the Bodangora windfarm near Dubbo in inland New South Wales, for a retail power purchase agreement that provides the port with large scale generation certificates linked to the windfarm. Chief executive officer Craig Carmody said the Port of Newcastle’s title as the largest coal port in the world “isn’t as wonderful as it used to be” and that change was necessary to avoid what happened in Newcastle and the steel industry closed.
“I would prefer to be doing this now while we have control over our destiny, while we have revenue coming in, than in a crisis situation where our revenue has collapsed and no one will lend us money,” Carmody said. “We get 84 cents a tonne for coal shipped through our port. We get between $6 and $8 for every other product. You can see where I’d rather have my money.” As part of its transition the port has converted 97% of its vehicles to electric and engaged in other infrastructure projects to decarbonise its operations. Andrew Stock, climate councillor and retired energy executive who was a founding board member of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, welcomed the development but said there was a “still long way to go”. “It’s a good thing they’re looking at it, but 50% income diversification by 2030, it’s still a decade away. That’s still a lot of coal that’s going to go through that port particularly when the IEA and the IPCC have made it clear we have to move,” Stock said. “And 50% by 2030 is still 50% coal income.” Stock said governments should encourage a “rapid advance in the uptake of renewables” similar to what has occurred in South Australia, which is powered by 100% renewable energy on some days. Carmody said that as an “open access port” the business was unable to refuse traffic except under specific circumstances, but he hoped showing the company was embracing change would encourage its workforce and others to do the same. “In some ways it doesn’t matter what the policies of government are, equities and debt markets, they’re making the decision for us,” Carmody says. “It doesn’t matter what the policy settings are in Australia, it’s what some investor in New York or Tokyo is thinking.” “We don’t really have a choice. Nobody wants to invest in [being part of the fossil fuel supply chain].” The announcement comes as figures from Dylan McConnell, research fellow the University of Melbourne’s Climate and Energy College, shows renewable energy provided nearly a third of all electricity produced in the national electricity market (NEM).
In the last three months of 2021, coal’s share of the electricity grid fell 5.9% when compared to the same period in 2020, while gas recorded its lowest quarter of generation since 2004 Over the same period, rooftop solar grew 24% and utility solar by 26% – though wind’s share only grew by a “quite modest” 6.4% compared to previous years. This was partly due to poor wind conditions and a lack of new capacity. “At the high level, solar is squeezing out coal, particularly black coal,” McConnell said. “You can see it quite clearly in the shape of what’s happened to the profile of generation.” McConnell said that Victoria and South Australia recorded average negative power prices in the middle for the entire quarter. “It’s a sign of the time that we’re getting negative prices on average,” McConnell said. “Coal’s being hollowed out in the middle of the day and that’s also what’s affecting their bottom line as well, as that’s when you’re having negative prices quite consistently.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/05/worlds-largest-coal-port-to-be-100-powered-by-renewable-energy;3
265;265;5509;5509;Desperation as China’s locked down cities pay price of zero-Covid strategy;2022-01-05T06:21:57Z;['Helen Davidson'];['Coronavirus', 'China', 'Asia Pacific'];"Strict lockdowns in the Chinese cities of Xi’an and Yuzhou are taking their toll on the population and healthcare systems, according to residents, with complaints of food shortages and dangerous delays in accessing medical care. Xi’an, a city of 13 million people, has been under a strict lockdown for nearly two weeks, while Yuzhou’s 1.2 million residents have been ordered to stay inside since Monday evening, after three asymptomatic cases were discovered. Public transport, the use of private motor vehicles, and operation of all shops and venues not supplying daily necessities have all been suspended.
On China’s strictly monitored and regulated social media platforms, a significant number of residents have posted about their concerns and anxieties, despite generally broad support for authorities’ swift response to outbreaks. Local media has reported concerning delays in the cities’ major hospitals, which require negative tests from patients before they can be admitted. A screenshot of one post which went viral before being deleted claimed a man and his sick father were turned away from a Xi’an hospital because they were from an area designated as higher risk. The post said the man’s father was having a heart attack but died by the time he was admitted for treatment.
In another account posted to social media, a woman in labour lost her baby after she was prevented from entering a Xi’an hospital. In a since-deleted post, a relative described calling emergency services on the night of 1 January for their aunt after she started feeling pain, but the phone rang out.
Instead they sent her to hospital at around 8pm but “the front door security wouldn’t let us in, because the nucleic acid test result had been more than four hours ago”, they said. “While she was waiting outside, I saw the video her husband sent me, she was holding the chair, struggling to sit on it, and her blood streamed down the chair and her pants.” They said hospital staff saw and brought her inside and to the operating room, but the child died. A spokeswoman for the state-linked Shaanxi women’s federation, said they had talked to authorities about the incident. “They should be learning about the incident now. Because the epidemic in Xi’an is quite serious now, there definitely should be a solution.”
Reports of food shortages in Xi’an have also flourished on social media despite promises by authorities to deliver supplies to homes, and claims of neighbours bartering cigarettes and personal belongings for food. “I have only received free vegetables once so far, and one package per household,” said one resident. “The price of food in the city is very high, and there is no one to regulate it. There is no take-away service for daily necessities, and the errand fee is about 100 yuan ($15) before someone takes the order.” The strict rules have also prevented people from coming and going. Sixth Tone reported authorities had arrested several people trying to evade the blockades and return to villages without quarantining, including a man who cycled 100km (60 miles) through mountains, and another who swam across an icy river. Authorities have conceded there have been issues, including poorly prepared centralised quarantine facilities where tens of thousands of people have been sent. Local officials are often punished or fired for alleged failures in outbreak prevention, including two senior Communist party officials in Xi’an who were removed from their posts over their “insufficient rigour in preventing and controlling the outbreak”. On Monday, Xi’an officials said the city had spent about $1m on assisting people in need, and had housed about 200 stranded people in temporary shelters. They also promised to set up hotlines and further assistance services. Xi’an is the centre of the current outbreak, China’s worst since the early months of the pandemic. More than 1,700 cases have been recorded in the city since early December – a relatively low number compared with global figures as China continues to implement the zero-Covid strategy which has kept infections at low levels for much of the past 18 months. With the Olympics around the corner and a central government commitment vowing to stamp out the virus, local officials have enacted increasingly strict responses, resulting in lockdowns reminiscent of Wuhan’s in early 2020. Other urban hubs where clusters have been detected now also face restrictions including a new partial lockdown in the city of Zhengzhou over the discovery of four cases. On Tuesday, China reported 41 new symptomatic community cases, including 35 in Xi’an. On Wednesday, officials said the city’s outbreak had been largely “brought under control” after the lockdown. Ma Guanghui, deputy director of Shaanxi health commission, told a press conference the outbreak was “showing a downward trend”.

267;267;5511;5511;How The Lost Daughter confronts one of our most enduring cultural taboos;2022-01-05T06:03:33Z;['Adrian Horton'];['The Lost Daughter', 'Film', 'Maggie Gyllenhaal', 'Elena Ferrante', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Olivia Colman', 'Netflix', 'Dakota Johnson', 'Jessie Buckley'];"It is clear from the opening minutes of The Lost Daughter, Maggie Gyllenhaal’s melancholic, bristly directorial debut on Netflix, that a dark secret stalks the sunny Mediterranean vacation of Leda Caruso, (a luminous Olivia Colman), a 48-year-old English professor of comparative literature. Her “working holiday” at a Greek island is immediately beset by increasingly ominous intrusions: a spectral foghorn, a bowl of rotting fruit, a shrill cicada, a boisterous Italian American family from Queens who disrupt her beachside reading. Memories pull at her focus; when the young daughter of Nina (Dakota Johnson), a beautiful, languid member of the Queens bunch who immediately catches Leda’s attention, goes briefly missing, Nina’s panic elides with a flashback to twentysomething Leda’s (Jessie Buckley) frantic search for her daughter Bianca at a beach.
It’s a familiar language of buried secrets, sinister subtext and unspooling memories – the building blocks of suspense – but the landmines in The Lost Daughter aren’t the usual culprits of dark revelation: unspeakable trauma or abuse, evil spirits, suppressed desires, the ravages of capitalism or greed. Instead, the molten core of The Lost Daughter is one of our culture’s most enduring and least touchable taboos: the selfish, uncaring, “unnatural” mother – one who doesn’t shift easily to care-taking, who does not relish her role, who not only begrudges but resents her children. The Lost Daughter, adapted (and anglicized) from the short novel of the same name by Elena Ferrante, is a masterclass in imbuing ostensibly low stakes with spellbinding tension. The book is written entirely in Leda’s internal monologue, which Gyllenhaal, aided by Colman and Buckley’s fluid performances, conveys through taut dialogue and flashback sequences. The action is relatively mundane – Leda goes to the beach, eats dinner alone, and observes an exhausted Nina fielding the demands of her restless daughter Elena, who is lost for all of a few minutes. The most significant transgression is Leda’s impulsive and childish theft of Elena’s beloved doll. The film’s climactic reveal is not an act of abuse or searing trauma, as the prevalence of the trauma plot in film, TV and literature has taught us to expect, but an absence: for three years, Leda, desperate for reprieve and recognition, forfeited her role as mother, and left her daughters with her husband (Jack Farthing).
The stakes of The Lost Daughter feel so weighty, the viewing experience so unsettling and transgressive, because the myth Leda’s recollections deftly unravel – that motherhood will come to women naturally, that it will give something without taking something irreparable and valuable away – is so deeply woven into our culture as to be almost invisible. It is everywhere and nowhere, the idea of motherhood as an identity of tenderness, sacrifice, fulfillment and, above all, selflessness. It’s in commonly heard descriptions of motherhood as “my life completely changed”; “I became a different person”; “I found my purpose”; “I met myself”. (Which may be true for some people!) It shapes the image of mom-fluencers and so-called mommy blogs, informs the constant pressure for mothers to optimize every facet of their child’s life, and underpins the norms that, in the US, justify women as the de facto social safety net. The Lost Daughter, as in several of Ferrante’s other works (fans will note themes further explored in her bestselling Neapolitan novels), dares to posit that for some, motherhood might not actualize the self but plunder it, especially if, like Leda, she becomes one while still barely an adult herself (doing the math, Leda was 23 when she had her first child, 25 for her second). Leda’s ambivalence toward motherhood – magnetic, vulgar, revelatory, repulsive – is a posture still rarely explored on screen. There are anti-mothering villains in films and television (Psycho, Carrie, the horror films Hereditary and The Lodge) but few examples of women who struggle with the expectations of the role in good faith, fewer still those who reject it.
Crucially, The Lost Daughter is not a portrait of regret, for either having children or leaving them. Leda never says the word, nor does she appear to feel in isolation from other emotions such as guilt, anguish, pride, love. Gyllenhaal takes pains to portray Leda as anything but an uncaring person. She comforts Nina, meets her confessions with serrated vulnerability, offers up her apartment as a hideaway for the young mother’s nascent affair. She glows reminiscing about her 20s over dinner, comforts a frightened, lost Elena on the beach. In flashback sequences, Leda can be withholding, vindictive, unreasonable with her daughters; she is also doting, curious, radiant, expressive as she teaches her children to read, to play, or just holds them. Watching the scenes of her failures and abandonment – rebuffing her daughters, lashing out at them, leaving them – is an uncomfortable experience. Self-absorption is often indistinguishable from self-preservation, and neither are pretty. I resent Leda for ignoring her children, and I can imagine the language through which they’ll later describe their abandonment, perhaps estrangement. (For what it’s worth, I write this as a 28-year-old woman both drawn to and terrified by the prospect of having kids.) But Gyllenhaal’s unwavering focus on Leda’s battered interiority, and Colman and Buckley’s equal expressiveness, refuse to allow you to condemn her. Leda is a woman under siege – in the past, from the constant barrages of motherhood upon her body, sleep, time, academic career, her identity, sexiness, professional opportunities. She has no outlet for herself, no recourse for the pressure and little help from her clueless husband. In the present, from the memories of exhaustion, the hauntings of failure, the ghosts of condemnation. Motherhood, she delicately tells a pregnant member of the Queens family, is “a crushing responsibility”. The Lost Daughter sits with a woman who escaped its suffocation, however temporarily; the women who experience it disjointedly, and for whom there is no peace.

Marquetta Williams told the Repository newspaper her 46-year-old husband, James, was using an AR-15 rifle that belonged to her to fire celebratory shots early on Saturday outside their home in Canton. That night, James, a stay-at-home father or stepfather of six girls, was at home with his wife, three of their daughters and two other family members. Marquetta Williams said the gunfire was an annual tradition in their neighborhood, with many neighbors also firing shots. She also said James was behind a 6ft fence, adding: “You can’t see in. You can’t see out.” James Williams came back inside the house, his wife said, then decided to go back outside and shoot some more. His wife said he fired four shots into the air and turned to follow her inside, then told her: “I’ve been shot.” “I could see the blood splattering across his shirt,” Marquetta Williams said. “He collapsed in the living room.” Referring to the police officer who shot him, she said: “His life was in danger, because you didn’t announce yourself. That’s cold-blooded and I’m not going to rest until he does get justice, period.” Marquetta Williams called 911. When she opened her door, she said, “There were 30-something officers with guns pointing at us, telling us to get down and come out of the house with our hands up.” She told Cleveland 19 News protests and a vigil were planned. In a statement, the Canton police chief, Jack Angelo, said officers were investigating reports of gunfire when an officer who was outside his vehicle confronted someone who began shooting a firearm. Angelo said the officer feared for his safety and fired his duty weapon at the person, striking him. The department has declined further comment. Marquetta Williams said no officers identified themselves before the shooting occurred around 12.05am. James Williams was taken to a hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later. “Out of the blue, he said he got shot, he got hit,” she said. “I don’t know where it came from. Nobody said anything. They didn’t say, ‘Police.’ They didn’t say, ‘Freeze.’ They didn’t say, ‘Drop your weapon.’ They just shot him.” The Ohio bureau of criminal investigation was investigating and all evidence including body-camera images and firearms had been turned over to the agency, police said. The officer involved was placed on administrative duty, standard procedure in shootings involving police. His name was not immediately released. No officers were injured.;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/ohio-police-shooting-new-year-rifle;1
269;269;5513;5513;US law professor condemned for ‘white supremacist’ comments by own dean;2022-01-05T06:00:34Z;['Erum Salam'];['US universities', 'US news', 'Pennsylvania', 'Race'];The dean of the University of Pennsylvania’s law school has condemned one of his school’s own professors for making racist remarks about Asians, saying that their recent comments were “xenophobic and white supremacist”. Professor Amy Wax, who specializes in social welfare law and labor and family economics law, appeared as a guest on economist Glenn Loury’s podcast when she called the influx of “Asian elites” into the United States problematic and made other racist statements, including a call for less immigration from Asian countries. In a scathing response, Dean Theodore Ruger acknowledged that while Wax’s comments were protected by freedom of speech and she held tenure at the college, they were “diametrically opposed to the policies and ethos of this institution”. “They serve as a persistent and tangible reminder that racism, sexism and xenophobia are not theoretical abstractions but are real and insidious beliefs in this country and in our building,” Ruger said of Wax’s comments. In the podcast Wax asserted that most Asian Americans are Democrats and questioned whether or not “the spirit of liberty beat in their breast”. “As long as most Asians support Democrats and help to advance their positions, I think the United States is better off with fewer Asians and less Asian immigration,” Wax said. She went on to criticize diversity and inclusion initiatives and said immigrants should be “abjectly grateful” rather than critical of the United States. Of diversity as a general concept, Wax said she was not convinced there were no downsides. Wax has come under fire before for previous arguments she made at the National Conservatism Conference in 2019 for “cultural distance” or “taking the position that our country will be better off with more whites and fewer non-whites”. In 2017, Penn law school alumni petitioned Ruger to take action against Wax for inaccurate statements that Black students didn’t graduate at the top quarter of their class and rarely graduated in the top half.

270;270;5514;5514;More than a feeling: why our emotions are crucial to the way we think | Leonard Mlodinow;2022-01-05T06:00:34Z;['Leonard Mlodinow'];['Neuroscience', 'Psychology', 'Science', 'Biology', 'Charles Darwin'];"Charles Darwin created the most successful theory in the history of biology: the theory of evolution. He was also responsible for another grand theory: the theory of emotion, which dominated his field for more than a century. That theory was dead wrong. The most important tenet of his theory was that the mind consists of two competing forces, the rational and the emotional. He believed emotions played a constructive role in the lives of non-human animals, but in humans emotions were a vestige whose usefulness had been largely superseded by the evolution of reason. We now know that, on the contrary, emotions enhance our process of reasoning and aid our decision-making. In fact, we can’t make decisions, or even think, without being influenced by our emotions. Consider a pioneering 2010 study in which researchers analysed the work of 118 professional traders in stocks, bonds and derivatives at four investment banks. Some were highly successful, but many were not. The researchers’ goal was to understand what differentiated the two groups. Their conclusion? They had different attitudes toward the role of emotion in their job. The relatively less successful traders for the most part denied that emotion played a significant role. They tried to suppress their emotions, while at the same time denying that emotions had an effect on their decision-making. The most successful traders, in contrast, had a different attitude. They showed a great willingness to reflect on their emotion-driven behaviour. They recognised that emotion and good decision-making were inextricably linked. Accepting that emotions were necessary for high performance, they “tended to reflect critically about the origin of their intuitions and the role of emotion”. Though the successful traders embraced the positive and essential role emotions played, they understood that when emotions become too intense it is useful to know how to tone them down. The issue for them was not how to avoid emotion, but how to regulate and harness it. Today, it has become common for hedge funds and financial firms to employ “psychology coaches” to meet traders on a one-on-one basis, as portrayed in the television series Billions. If emotions aid rational reasoning, how does that work? Perhaps the most important discovery regarding the role of emotion is that even when you believe you are exercising cold, logical reason, you aren’t. People aren’t usually aware of it, but the very framework of their thought process is highly influenced by what they’re feeling at the time – sometimes subtly, sometimes not. As the Caltech neuroscientist Ralph Adolphs puts it: “Each emotion is a functional state of the mind that puts your brain in a particular mode of operation that adjusts your goals, directs your attention, and modifies the weights you assign to various factors as you do mental calculations.” Think of an iPhone. In its normal mode of operation, the phone’s goal is to always be ready to serve you. To best accomplish that, the iPhone is constantly at work, doing things like “listening” for you to yell “Hey, Siri”, checking to see if there are new emails to download, and updating your apps even if you are not currently using them. In low-power mode, the priorities are changed. Energy conservation is important, so these actions are reduced or stopped altogether. Though enormously more complex, the human brain is like an iPhone in that it constantly carries out computations. It evolved to compute what actions would be most likely to nurture your health, prevent premature death and increase the probability that you will successfully reproduce. And like the iPhone, our brains possess a number of specialised programs, each tailored to solving a problem. Some of our programs apply to practical issues such as foraging, mate choice, facial recognition, sleep management and energy allocation. Others handle cognitive issues such as learning, memory, goal selection and so on. Just as the iPhone adjusts its programming when in low-power mode, a biological brain can run in various modes, each with different characteristics. An emotion – both in humans and animals – is a functional backdrop that orchestrates and coordinates those many programs in a manner tuned to the type of situation you are in. Consider anger, for example. Backed by the threat of aggression, anger creates incentives for others to appease the angry individual. Your mental calculus inflates the importance you place on your own welfare and goals at the expense of those of others. Coaches tap into anger as a motivational tool because the focus on self encourages athletes to push themselves to achieve their goals. Anger also causes you to perceive less risk, exacerbating risk-seeking. That can produce better judgments in situations where risk-aversion is inappropriate, as when you are analysing stocks, or playing poker.
The new view of emotion may not correspond to the way Darwin saw it, but it does support one of the basic conclusions of his theory of evolution: humans are not as different from non-human animals as people believed. What can we learn from this? The first and most crucial step is self-awareness. Studies show that those with high levels of emotional intelligence fare better in their personal and professional lives. By learning about our emotions we can read others better and communicate more effectively. And by understanding how emotions affect our thoughts and reasoning, we can learn to recognise and monitor them. Then, once we’re in touch with our true feelings, we can take steps to manage them whenever that would be of benefit.

271;271;5515;5515;More than 90 care home operators in England declare red alert over staffing;2022-01-05T06:00:34Z;['Robert Booth', 'Niamh McIntyre'];['Care workers', 'Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'Omicron variant', 'Social care', 'Society'];"Care operators are facing acute staffing shortages caused by Omicron with more than 90 declaring a “red” alert, which means staffing ratios have been breached. Over 11,000 care home workers are off for Covid reasons, according to internal health system staffing data seen by the Guardian. One of the UK’s largest private operators, Barchester, is dealing with outbreaks in 105 of its 250 homes. It said that rules meaning homes with Covid cannot accept hospital discharges will cause backlogs in the already struggling NHS. Across England, 9.4% of care home staff are off work, according to government live data, with close to 3% absent because of Covid. The figures, which may be an underestimate because of the festive break, are drawn from submissions by thousands of care providers. The worst affected areas appear to be in the north-east, north-west and parts of London, where combined Covid and non-Covid absence rates ranged from 16% to 22%. Experts said care standards could suffer as absences rose and councils were braced to redeploy staff from services such as libraries to help backfill threadbare rotas. “The spread of Omicron across the country will bring more care homes into outbreak, put huge pressure on the already compromised staff group and mean those who need care do not get it,” said Vic Rayner, chief executive of the National Care Forum. Many care operators said delays in getting PCR test results back were a key frustration, meaning workers who may not be infected were isolating longer than necessary.
At one Barchester home in Shrewsbury 17 staff are off and 22 residents have tested positive while at a home in east London 27 staff are off and 20 residents have tested positive. HC-One, the UK’s largest private care home provider, said 869 staff are off with Covid or awaiting results – close to 5% of the workforce. However, the virus is not causing widespread serious illness and death among residents, with 10 fatalities involving Covid in recent weeks across the chain, according to Pete Calveley, chief executive of Barchester, who said many residents “have only minor or cold-like symptoms”. But up to 15% of staff are off work at the chain’s worst affected homes and the struggle to find replacements has seen care agencies quoting £80 an hour for staff – quadruple the normal rate – and a new practice of “gazumping”, with homes losing already booked staff at the last minute to operators willing to pay more. Mike Padgham, a care operator in Yorkshire, on Tuesday urged the health secretary, Sajid Javid, urgently to establish a “volunteer army” of retired nurses, doctors, and carers who could fill shifts.
In Wales, Mario Kreft, chair of Care Forum Wales, described the situation as “hugely serious”, with large groups of staff testing positive after the Christmas break. He said that in the worst cases operators have had three-quarters of their staff off. Eight staff at one of his homes in north Wales reported positive tests on Tuesday morning. “It’s a war footing,” he said. “We are trying to get everyone to the frontline and it is very, very difficult. We are appealing for understanding.” Stephen Chandler, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said councils were braced for calls for help from care operators and said “the care that people experience will be affected”. In his county, Oxfordshire, a call has gone out for help from volunteers who work in libraries and at heritage sites. Sanjiv Joshi, who runs 14 care homes in south Wales, said in one home over Christmas there were only half the staff needed to cover shifts, meaning that new recruits going through training had to be hurried into frontline roles. “We are 20% down [on staff],” he said. “I know of other providers who say they are 30% to 50% down. Our biggest worry is the infection rates are so high it’s not going to spare anyone. We need an effective lockdown or control measures so that we don’t let the infections spiral out of control.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Protecting care staff and people who use social care services continues to be a priority, especially as cases surge and Omicron spreads rapidly across the country. “Throughout the pandemic, we have made almost £2.4bn in specific funding available for adult social care and this week we announced an extra £60m to keep people in care homes safe over January.’’";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/90-care-home-operators-in-england-declare-red-alert-over-staffing-covid;2
272;272;5516;5516;School closures, grieving students and social media slang: Phil Redmond on his plans for Grange Hill – the Movie;2022-01-05T06:00:34Z;['Gabriel Tate'];['Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Grange Hill', 'Drama', 'Hollyoaks', 'Soap opera'];"From Brookside’s bodies under the patio through the Emmerdale plane crash to Luke Morgan’s rape in Hollyoaks, Phil Redmond has always known how to frame a story. Sitting in his home office, flowing grey locks now thinning a little, the 72-year-old scouser who masterminded them all is gesturing over Zoom to a wall where a 2019 Daily Star front page hangs: “Bring Grange Hill Back to Save Britain.” Next to it is a print of the comic-strip opening credits still so revered that, in May, Richard Osman got “the Grange Hill sausage” (which appeared, to consternation, in one frame of them) trending on Twitter. Two sheets of paper, but testament to the series’ enduring popularity 13 years after its cancellation – hence why Redmond has just finished the script for a Grange Hill film due in late 2022. “It’s astonishing how many people tell me it was their favourite programme. Especially politicians,” says Redmond, before roaring with laughter. “David Cameron told me his favourite character was [school bully] Gripper Stebson. It breaks the ice when you’re trying to get them to do things.” Redmond – Sir Phil since last October – has spent much of his time since selling his production company Mersey Television in 2005 as a media studies professor at Liverpool John Moores, and chair of National Museums Liverpool and the UK City of Culture Expert Advisory Panel. But the urge to tell stories never deserted him: Highbridge, the first in a proposed trilogy of state-of-the-nation novels, emerged in 2016 but only partially scratched the itch. And so he returned to his first, greatest creation.
Irritated by an article speculating – inaccurately, in his view – on the likely careers of Grange Hill alumni including Zammo McGuire (Lee MacDonald) and Tucker Jenkins (Todd Carty), but thrilled by the show’s second life on social media (a meme splicing Beyoncé’s Single Ladies video to the theme tune went viral), he reconvened with former collaborators last February to consider what had really happened to the school, its current intake and former pupils. Casting will begin soon and he hopes members of the old guard will return to play parents and grandparents alongside a new generation of pupils. “We’ve been through four school-rebuilding programmes in my lifetime, but it’s not about bricks and mortar, it’s about getting the best out of every pupil. How will ripping schools out of communities solve anything? Or making catchment areas so big that kids have to travel miles to be with their friends? That’s the thesis of the movie: it’s decided the school is costing too much to maintain so it should be knocked down, the land sold and proceeds used to build a new one and replenish local coffers.” The battle between parsimonious authorities and students troubled by the school’s uncertain future allows Redmond to voice long-held concerns about left-behind communities clinging to schools as rare hubs not yet underfunded into extinction. The film will also show how children handle grief (it will be set in a post-Covid Britain, with many students having lost elderly relatives), discuss social media and the purpose of education itself, as the ageing head fights a losing battle against a deputy eyeing up a promotion to run the proposed “superschool”. How would a new generation of Grange Hill students react to all this? “I’ve always had a strand about kids having the same emotions and fears, aspirations and phobias as everybody else. They only lack the life experience. Rather than riots in the dining hall, this time their voices are heard through social media, a rebuttal unit run by the school geek against council propaganda.” Redmond is cagey about further specifics, but promises the film will reflect the canny balance of knockabout humour and serious, issue-led drama that made the show work. Putting it on television, though, was never an option: TV has “lost its wide ambition”, with the prospect likely too thorny for traditional broadcasters (although the BBC is reviving another school drama, Waterloo Road, next year) and too parochial for streaming services.
Will Grange Hill still reflect the concerns of children today. “I’ll give the same answer I gave when I got asked that at 29: I used to be one! Childhood doesn’t really change. What changes are fashion, haircuts and slang. Once you’ve got the theme and the tone, it’s all about casting – the actors bring you what’s right at the time, you’ve just got to let them be natural.” This commitment to naturalism underpinned the appeal of Grange Hill: the relationships between children and teenagers were written with frankness and honesty, told literally from the kids’ viewpoint (cameras filmed from the children’s eyeline) and performed by working-class, comprehensive schoolchildren using their own accents. The approach was as groundbreaking as the issues it tackled when Redmond worked alongside script editor Anthony Minghella during the programme’s mid-80s pomp. Alongside stories of smoking and sexual awakening, there was social commentary. Benny Green’s (Terry Sue-Patt) footballing talents couldn’t cover for the scruffy uniform his family could barely afford. Gripper Stebson (Mark Savage) picked on a Sikh student and mixed with skinheads. Above all, there was Zammo’s descent into drug addiction, which provoked questions in the House of Commons and tabloid headlines warning of potential copycats; it also took the cast to the White House to meet Nancy Reagan and into the Top 5 with tie-in single Just Say No.
The show retained its edge into the 90s: comedian Francesca Martinez played a character with cerebral palsy who refused to be treated differently to her peers; homophobia, teenage motherhood and suicidal thoughts were also addressed with care and conviction, before it lost its way and audiences dwindled. Grange Hill’s present-day descendants are legion. Series from Ackley Bridge and Jamie Johnson to Sex Education and Skins owe it a considerable debt for redefining how ambitious, bold and relatable television for younger viewers could be. “The difference is, those shows look at the characters in the precinct, not the influence of the wider community,” Redmond says.
Born and raised in the Liverpool suburb of Huyton, the son of a cleaner and a bus driver, Redmond drew on his own disappointing experiences at St Kevin’s, one of Liverpool’s biggest comprehensives, for the resolutely unsentimental Grange Hill. Having studied sociology at Liverpool University, he took up screenwriting in his early 20s after a spell as a quantity surveyor that, a decade later, would give him the financial and logistical nous to buy and kit out the cul-de-sac that became Brookside Close. Redmond has always been about the long game: Zammo’s heroin storyline took two years to resolve, the Jordaches’ domestic violence storyline on Brookside, three. And while he’s happy to rib Cameron, he’s too canny to pass judgment on someone he will surely have to deal with – even Nadine Dorries, now DCMS Secretary and not, I venture, the greatest advert for Merseyside. “I think you’re being slightly unfair,” he says, laughing. “She’s an unknown quantity in that position – maybe she’s making the right noises, but not in the way people want them to be said.” He has already written to her about Channel 4, which he still resents for the shabbily handled demise of Brookside in 2003. Dorries’s grasp of C4’s funding may have seemed shaky at a recent select committee, but Redmond is well informed and opinionated enough for the both of them.
“What the hell’s Channel 4 for now? It serves no purpose, but rather than flog it off for a devalued price, why not retain the remit, sweep out the costs of transmission, management and buildings and give the ad revenue to the BBC so we have one big, sustainable public service broadcaster?” He has thoughts, too, on the BBC. “It belongs to the people, so you need to keep them on board and willing to pay for it. The licence fee should be replaced by more of a cultural precept on every landline and mobile phone contract: the more you use online content, the more you’ll be contributing to the BBC.”
Dorries can expect a pugnacious encounter with a man whose disillusionment with central government is total: the phrase “levelling up” prompts a derisive snort. “I’ve been in the levelling up agenda since I came into television – it’s why I set Brookside in Liverpool. Like the ‘big society’, it’s a great idea with a crap slogan. There’s no north-south divide, it’s just London versus everybody else. People in Cornwall or Hereford have the same fundamental issues as people in the big conurbations, but they can’t get a hearing and communities are dying. Most people didn’t believe in HS2, but they reacted to the cancellation of the north-east leg because at least it had been something. You can’t be surprised when people lose faith.” Perhaps Grange Hill – the Movie will reach out across the regions and generations. I ask about the legacy of the series. He mentions a recent Guardian interview with Garbage’s Shirley Manson, who credits it with saving her life when school bullying drove her to self-harm. “She was saying what I used to say during all the big controversies,” says Redmond. “Grange Hill never claimed it would solve your problem, but it was a touchstone – something to guide people through rites of passage and say: ‘You’re not alone.’” Grange Hill – the Movie will be released later this year.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/05/phil-redmond-interview-grange-hill-the-movie;5
273;273;5517;5517;UK towns and cities hit by flash flooding 51 times since 2007;2022-01-05T06:00:34Z;['Sandra Laville'];['Flooding', 'Environment', 'UK news', 'Climate crisis', 'Society'];"Flooding over the past 14 years has caused major disruption to towns and cities, schools, hospitals and care homes, a study reveals. The analysis shows towns and cities have been hit by flash flooding 51 times. Fifteen hospitals and 68 schools have also suffered from rising flood waters, which have caused major disruption to patients and to children. The analysis, carried out by the Conservative-leaning thinktank Bright Blue, says that with increased flooding due to the climate emergency, the government must do more to improve the resilience of communities, businesses, and other infrastructure. Using a form of artificial intelligence called Natural Language Processing (NLP), the data was collected by analysing archives of thousands of local, regional and national newspapers. The report comes after the devastation caused by Storm Arwen last October, when members of the public were left without power for more than a week. Storm Arwen was one of the worst in a generation. Electricity poles snapped and wires came down across large swathes of the country. The north-east of England, the Wye Valley, the Lake District, Aberdeenshire and Perthshire were among some of the worst-hit areas. The analysis shows that the impact on essential services such as power, which was dramatically highlighted by Arwen, is a threat linked to flooding for the last 14 years and will continue to be to in future as climate impacts increase extreme weather events. Since 2007, according to the analysis, there have been at least 12 instances of flooded electricity substations, in at least one case leading to power cuts that were problematic for emergency response and community resilience, and at least five instances of damage to gas pipelines due to the bridges supporting them collapsing. Working with the NGO ClimateNode, the authors produced the data in an interactive map of storm impacts. Bright Blue said the analysis revealed that the UK was not adequately prepared for the increasing risk posed by flooding as the climate changes. Particular areas of concern are: Urban drainage: heavy rainfall puts drainage and sewerage infrastructure under strain, even exceeding their limits, and contributing to flooding in some cases. Hospitals: at least 15 experienced flooding causing disruption or imminent risk of disruption to patient services or hospital support services, Schools: a least 68 schools have suffered sufficient water entering buildings to disrupt lessons, or school transport; 22 suffered at least significant damage and seven severe damage and Care homes: nine care homes and four retirement complexes have been flooded. Major disruptions to social care included carers unable to reach elderly people in rural areas; loss of power, hot water and heating in care homes. Helen Jackson, associate fellow at Bright Blue and the report’s author, said: “The disruption caused by Storm Arwen highlights the need to make our infrastructure resilient to extreme weather, and be more preventive and less reactive. “Many towns and cities in the UK are seeing repeat episodes of flash flooding affecting households, businesses, and transport systems. We need to recognise this trend and do much more to ensure our urban drainage and sewer systems can cope with heavy rainfall as the climate changes. This should include limiting the spread of impermeable surfaces in our cities and ensuring basic measures like drain cleaning are not overlooked.” The report called for the government to support and fund an ongoing programme of research to identify and monitor risks associated with extreme rainfall in urban areas. It also said government should conduct a civil resilience exercise for an extreme rainfall event in a major UK urban area, incorporating significant infrastructure failure. Ryan Shorthouse, the chief executive of Bright Blue, said: “Flooding is one of the most serious climate-related challenges that this country is facing and will continue to face as the climate changes further in the coming years. “The impact of flooding is already being felt deeply in communities across the UK. The UK government can and must do much more to better improve the resilience of local communities, businesses, public services, and critical infrastructure to flooding.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/05/uk-towns-and-cities-hit-by-flash-flooding-51-times-since-2007;3

Locations of towns and cities have been determined by which direction those giant rivers of ice flowed; tourists flock to see the picturesque lakes and hills sculpted by their brute force, and gardeners curse soils with an overabundance of glacial clay. Now those ancient ice sheets are reminding us of their existence out at sea too, influencing which locations are suitable for offshore windfarms. Gareth Carter, a marine geoscientist at the British Geological Survey, has been using subsurface imagery to map the land under the North Sea and advising engineers where to site their foundations for the huge Dogger Bank Wind Farm, 80 miles (130km) off the north-east coast of England. “Glacial sediments are highly variable, ranging from layered soft silts and clays, deposited in a lake formed by meltwater in front of the melting ice sheet, through to incredibly hard, chaotic and contorted deposits, dumped by a departing ice sheet,” he says. As windfarms move to ever deeper waters and rely on innovative anchor technologies to hold floating turbines in place, Carter and his colleagues are finding themselves in ever more demand, helping engineers to avoid troublesome boulders and identify suitable ground for foundations.";https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/05/terrawatch-the-link-between-ancient-ice-sheets-and-offshore-windfarms;3
275;275;5519;5519;Run that marathon! Write that novel! How to make 2022 the year you finally smash your goals;2022-01-05T06:00:33Z;['Elle Hunt'];['Life and style', 'Psychology', 'Marathon running', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Hobbies'];"This year, my new year resolution is to finish the first draft of a novel. It’s a realistic goal – I’m not saying it has to make money, or even be any good. I just want the words on the page, even if all they do then is languish for ever in a folder. Well, I say that’s what I want – but of course finishing a draft was my new year resolution last year, and the year before that, and before that. In truth, I’ve been pushing back this particular ambition since 2017. Maybe for you, it’s running a marathon – or a 5k. It might be losing a particular amount of weight, or completing a course in yoga or a foreign language. It could be a time-intensive project such as making a quilt or researching your family history. Many of us have these mid- to long-term goals that are ambitious, but (in theory) achievable with the requisite investment of time and effort. I’m going to guess that many other people also have not made a start – even if last year’s lockdowns meant that they, like me, had endless hours to fill. So why do we put off these goals, and how can we make 2022 the year we finally attain them? I spoke to experts to find out. Focus on the process – not perfection “It’s a very human problem,” says Fuschia Sirois when I describe my situation. A professor of psychology at the University of Sheffield, Sirois studies procrastination and perfectionism – and their toll on wellbeing. She says both factor into our failure to get started on projects. “When you’re working towards something and you’re not quite there, anything is possible; you can imagine how successful it will be,” says Sirois. “But we know that’s not what happens in real life.” In other words, just taking a step towards my goal will be a sobering reminder of the long road ahead. The story I’m capable of writing may not be bad, but it will, inevitably, be unlike how I have imagined it, and that realisation alone can throw us off, says Sirois. “We preserve that goal when we never get started – it just becomes that abstract thing, out there.” So willpower and a plan are not necessarily enough. Sirois’s research shows that we procrastinate on a task to avoid difficult emotions. “We are not rational beings. Our fears, anxieties, personal internal struggles, the negative scripts we have about ourselves, our self-esteem – all these things come into motion.” Procrastinating can then add another layer of self-criticism – while perfectionism can trick us into thinking that there’s an optimum time to start. The paralysis Sirois describes is painfully familiar. I couldn’t count the number of weeknights and weekends that I’ve felt ambient guilt for not writing, even though I had not planned to do so. Sirois suggests, instead, that I try drilling down into these emotional blocks. For instance, they could represent my being critical of myself, which I can meet with self-compassion – or my uncertainty about the task, calling for research. “It’s easy to blame the plan. It’s much harder to say: ‘I don’t know how to manage my emotions’,” says Sirois. Part of the problem, she says, is that we find it hard to accurately forecast our emotional states, meaning we can overstate the struggle of working towards our goal or the satisfaction we will feel achieving it – or both.
“What we learn about ourselves along those longer journeys such as running a marathon or writing a novel, how we build our skills, the relationships we make and strengthen: that is actually what makes the experience much more rich and rewarding than we could ever imagine – but we tend to forget these things.” The solution, says Sirois, is to seek meaning from the process, not the outcome. A recent study showed that people who thought about why their goal was important to them spent much less time procrastinating than those who only thought about how good it would feel to achieve it. If I thought my latest chapter was bad, she suggests that I could reframe it to myself as “I’m becoming a better writer”. Someone training for a marathon might focus on keeping fit, spending time with friends, or following in family members’ footsteps. “You can look at the struggles you’re experiencing in a broader perspective, to see what it means in terms of your own personal growth,” says Sirois. But it’s tough, even for the experts. When she was on deadline for her recent audiobook, Do It Now: Overcoming Proscrastination, Sirois says, “it took me for ever to get started”. Pay yourself Katy Milkman, a behavioural scientist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and author of How to Change, suggests the barrier to making progress is often our bias towards feeling good now. “It may not be that pleasant, in the moment, to achieve that long-term goal,” she says. “You know you should, you know that you will be glad when you have – but each time you sit down, there’s something more tempting or proximate that is taking your attention away.” One way to overcome this is by linking the task to something pleasurable – for instance, restricting our favourite snacks or tea to writing sessions or watching TV only when on the treadmill. Milkman mentions a student who let herself light a scented candle only when she was working on her dissertation. It would have to be a pretty special scented candle, I say. “I agree,” says Milkman. “That’s not the thing for me.” Instead, she has beloved audiobooks that she uses to motivate herself for workouts. Another way is to use cash. Milkman recently conducted a “megastudy” of more than 60,000 US gym members, which found that this worked. Awarding reward points (equivalent to only 9¢ or about 6½p) to people who returned to the gym after missing a planned workout increased visits by about 16% compared with the baseline offering. Extending a bigger reward (points worth $1.75) for every workout was almost as effective, increasing visits by about 14%. So, if you want to run a marathon, try paying yourself a pound for every day you stick to your training plan. That strategy can be applied as the stick, not just the carrot, says Milkman: ask a loved one to charge you for every run you miss. That also adds an extra layer of accountability. If you don’t want to burden friends with this, there are services that automate it. Beeminder.com, for instance, plots your progress towards a quantifiable goal on a graph. When you cross to the wrong side of your trend line, Beeminder charges you. StickK.com likewise leverages the “psychological power of loss aversion” to drive behaviour change, charging you when you break the terms of your “commitment contract”.
According to Beeminder, you might find this strategy effective if there is “anything you know you should do, you really do want to do, you know for certain you can do, yet that, historically, you don’t do”. Also, if you are a “nerdy, lifehacking data freak”. Sounds like me. I stop short of signing up, for now, but I think this would work better for me than a scented candle. Stop daydreaming One of the most common strategies for success is to visualise it – picturing yourself crossing the finish line with a personal best, or seeing your bestseller on shelves. But, says Gabriele Oettingen – a professor of psychology at New York University and the University of Hamburg, and author of Rethinking Positive Thinking: Inside the New Science of Motivation – this could actually be counterproductive. Over many studies, her research has established an unexpected but powerful correlation between positive thinking and poor performance. “The more positive a daydream about the future, the less I put in effort to actually realise it,” Oettingen explains over Zoom from New York. In other words, fantasising about our goals makes us feel good in the short term – to the point of lowering our blood pressure – but it saps us of the energy we need to take action. “People feel accomplished,” says Oettingen. “Like they’re already there.” Worryingly, Oettingen suggests, this inaction could over time even lead to depression, with a correlative link established between fantasising about the future and a more negative mood. So, instead of simply visualising, Oettingen advocates what she calls “mental contrasting”: not just fantasising about success but comparing your daydream with reality to reveal what, specifically, is holding you back from achieving it. Once you understand clearly the obstacles standing in your way, you can plan to overcome them with an “if it’s this then I do that” plan. For example, my issue is that I prioritise work over writing my novel. So I could resolve to write fiction first thing in the morning, before I check my work email. Or if my goal was to jog in the evenings, but I lacked the motivation at the end of the workday, I could start small by putting on my running shoes before I clocked off – helping me over the first hurdle. Oettingen dubs this approach “Woop” – wish, outcome, obstacle, plan – and says it works for just about any behaviour change, from creating healthy habits to improving relationships and academic performance. (There are free resources at woopmylife.org, and an app.) Once you have nailed down what is holding you back, you will find that you are energised to work towards your goal – or that you aren’t as invested in it as you thought. In that case, Oettingen says, you can let go of this dream without guilt.
You could well find out that your goal was something you thought you should achieve, she says, because it is socially desirable or something your family and friends want. “By really looking at the obstacle, I will understand what to do to overcome it – I will also understand if the obstacle is too costly, there is not enough time, or it is simply not surmountable,” she says. “And then, with good conscience and full consciousness, I will simply get out and devote myself to more promising, feasible futures … Mental contrasting is a way to clean up your life.” And with that, Oettingen articulates the uneasy thought I have every time another new year rolls around without a draft done: how much can I really want to write this novel, if I still haven’t finished it? Test your goals Dave Evans was an early employee at Apple under Steve Jobs, and led the design of its first mouse. Now – as co-leader of Stanford University’s Designing Your Life course, and as co-author (with his boss Bill Burnett) of the bestseller of the same name – he teaches a practical approach to problem-solving. “We’re the get-you-unstuck guys,” he says cheerfully over Zoom from his office in sunny California. What I am grappling with, Evans tells me, is known as an “anchor problem” – in other words I am stuck on only one solution to my goal, which makes it “either impossible, or incredibly difficult to reach”.. Evans suggests a spot of reverse engineering – that I try reframing my problem by picturing myself six months after I’ve finished my draft. Why, specifically, am I happy? How is my life different, or better? “The first thing you have to do is be really empathetic with yourself, and with the person you think you’re trying to be.” From there, he says, you can work backwards. It might be that what future Elle wants, more than a finished draft, is to have a regular practice of fiction-writing – and I (she?) can work towards that without needing 80,000 words to show for it, Evans points out. “Give yourself a chance at succeeding,” he says. “One of the biggest problems psychologically with the grand goal is unattainability. It’s incredibly de-energising – people give up. So set the bar low: ‘What if I wrote for a week? I’m not writing a novel, I’m writing a chapter.’ Then do it again. Give yourself a chance at succeeding,” says Evans. He calls this prototyping: exploring different paths and possibilities through defined experiments. “Before you run a marathon, try a couple of 10ks,” he suggests. Not just for practice, but because you may find that achievement is enough, or that you don’t enjoy running enough to do a full marathon. The flexibility helps to ground your goal in reality, Evans says – to connect with your actual motivation, and confront the inevitable cost of pursuing it at the expense of other goals. “Many people who have this goal – the book, the marathon, the peak, ‘gotta lose 50lb’ – have almost no idea at all what’s involved.” Some may even be in a “long-term, nostalgic relationship” with their fantasy, says Evans. “But design always starts with reality.”
If you revisit your goal and find it is no longer relevant, you can still honour it as something that was significant to your past self, which has steered you this far and from which you can now move on. People who test their “grand goal” report feeling two things, says Evans: “They feel more hopeful – and they feel it’s doable.” I assure him that I’ll check back in next year. Then, that night, I write a scene: messy, not beautiful, but words on a page.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/05/run-that-marathon-write-that-novel-how-to-make-2022-the-year-you-finally-smash-your-goals;5
276;276;5520;5520;Meghan to receive just £1 from Mail on Sunday for privacy invasion;2022-01-05T06:00:33Z;['Jim Waterson'];['Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex', 'Privacy & the media', 'UK news', 'Monarchy', 'Mail on Sunday', 'Media', 'Associated Newspapers', 'MailOnline', 'Privacy', 'Intellectual property', 'National newspapers', 'Newspapers & magazines', 'Newspapers', 'World news'];"The Mail on Sunday will pay the Duchess of Sussex just £1 in damages for invading her privacy by publishing a private letter she had sent to her father. The nominal sum is set out in court documents that also formally confirm that the newspaper – and its sister website MailOnline – has accepted defeat and will not be taking the long-running case to a supreme court appeal. The outlet will also pay an unspecified sum for the separate case of infringing Meghan’s copyright by publishing large parts of the letter. Mark Stephens, a media lawyer, said the nominal settlement for the privacy aspect suggested a weakness in that aspect of Meghan’s case: “Normally for that kind of invasion of privacy you would expect £75,000 to £125,000. It does show that the curation of her reputation was an area where she had effectively invaded her own privacy.” The newspaper’s publisher has also agreed to pay a confidential sum in damages for copyright infringement. The Mail on Sunday also faces having to cover a substantial part of Meghan’s legal costs, which could be more than £1m.
The duchess had always said that her three-year legal battle against Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and sister website MailOnline, was more about principles than money. Her spokesperson said the court victories demonstrated the strength of both claims and the financial remedies would be based on Meghan’s right to an account of the newspaper’s profits following her win. The spokesperson described the payment as substantial and said it would be donated to charity. As part of the court settlement, the Mail outlets have also been ordered to avoid disclosing the names of five of Meghan’s friends who anonymously spoke to People magazine for a 2018 article about the royal. The newspaper had previously sought to name the individuals in legal proceedings. The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline were also ordered to carry front page and homepage declarations that they had lost the legal case, with the courts even specifying in which font the statements should appear. The outlets chose to do that on Boxing Day, one of the quietest news days of the year. Associated Newspapers had argued that Meghan’s case should have gone to trial but judges concluded otherwise. A ruling at the start of December said the duchess had a “reasonable expectation” of privacy regarding the contents of the letter to her father, Thomas Markle. “Those contents were personal, private and not matters of legitimate public interest,” said the appeal judge Sir Geoffrey Vos. Meghan celebrated that victory by calling for a reshaping of the tabloid industry and spoke of how she had been patient in the face of “deception, intimidation, and calculated attacks” and criticised a “tabloid industry that conditions people to be cruel, and profits from the lies and pain that they create”. At the time Associated Newspapers claimed it was willing to take the case to the supreme court but this turned out to be an empty threat. Focus is now likely to turn to the actions of the duchess’s husband, Prince Harry, who is suing both Rupert Murdoch’s News UK and Daily Mirror publisher Reach over phone-hacking claims in a case that could be heard later this year.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/meghan-one-pound-mail-on-sunday-privacy-invasion;1
277;277;5521;5521;New head of No 10 parties investigation ‘unlikely to start from scratch’;2022-01-05T06:00:33Z;['Aubrey Allegretti'];['Politics', 'Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'Conservatives', 'Boris Johnson', 'Gray report'];"The new head of an investigation into alleged rule-breaking Downing Street parties has not “started from scratch” and is unlikely to re-interview all government staff who have already been spoken to about their knowledge of the gatherings, the Guardian has been told. Sources said that Sue Gray, who took over the probe after cabinet secretary Simon Case recused himself when a Christmas event in his own office was revealed, would more likely “pick up” the existing work and look for “holes” in the testimony provided so far. In addition, Gray’s attention will have to turn to more gatherings that came to light since the initial probe led by Case began. Among them was an event revealed by the Guardian attended by prime minister Boris Johnson, his wife and 17 others. Attendees were pictured with cheese and wine in the No 10 garden in spring 2020, when socialising in groups was banned. The prime minister has insisted it was a “work meeting”.
One insider with knowledge of the investigation said they did not expect everyone already interviewed to have to go through the process again. They characterised the inquiry as “same team, different leader”. A second government source said Gray was unlikely to “discount anything the team has gathered before”, but that given the final report will be in her name, she would probably go through existing witness evidence to check for “holes” and seek further clarification from some people. They said Gray was not expected to re-interview everyone for the sake of it, explaining: “She won’t do things by default, she’ll be pragmatic.” The source added that “a different leader can make a team do different things”. It was initially hoped the parties probe would be concluded by Christmas. However, Case’s decision to step back from his role in it delayed the publication of its findings. Given there are more gatherings than the three included in the initial remit of investigators, Gray was said to have “a lot more on her plate than Case started with” so she would not have “started from scratch”. The result of her inquiry is expected to take several more weeks, however it will be made public. No 10 said the investigation was continuing, but stressed it was an “independent piece of work”. Asked if Gray would pick up where Case left off, the prime minister’s spokesperson said on Tuesday: “The work was led … through the propriety and ethics team.... She has picked up that and has been briefed by them.” The Cabinet Office declined to comment, but pointed to the original terms of reference laid down when Case ran the inquiry, which said investigators would “be able to speak to members of staff” and that ministers, special advisers, and civil servants “will be expected to cooperate”. Gray has a fearsome reputation as a “Whitehall enforcer” and her appointment to lead the probe was seen by many as making it less likely ministers would be able to evade scrutiny over the issue of potentially rule-breaking parties. However another Whitehall probe into the funding of refurbishments to Johnson’s Downing Street flat is reportedly set to clear him of breaching the ministerial code, fuelling claims of a “whitewash”. Johnson has denied personally breaking any Covid rules and said the inquiry into the gatherings would be released “as soon as we reasonably can”.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/05/new-head-of-no-10-parties-investigation-unlikely-to-start-from-scratch;4

Beyond the precipice lies the North Sea, calm today. To the south, ships at anchor waiting for a berth, offshore wind turbines and industrial Teesside. To the north, the conurbations of Seaham, Sunderland and South Tyneside. Behind me, agriculture, the coastal railway and a quarry. It’s high tide, bringing from far below the soporific sound of waves slapping against rocks. Fulmars, stiff-winged and silent, glide past the cliff edge, almost level with my head, giving me a sideways glance as they pass, as if to say: “I bet you wish you could do this.” And I do: it looks so effortless, so pleasurable. Turning away with a few shallow wingbeats, around they go again, out to sea, then back towards the cliff face, lowering their feet as air brakes at the last moment as they rise to ride the updraught once more. They pass so close that I can see turbulent airflow ruffling small feathers over the top of their long, slender wings, generating lift.
Around the headland is an impenetrable wall of wind-sculpted blackthorn, which suddenly opens on to another vertiginous, grassy slope, revealing the tiny bay called Hawthorn Hive. The rock face is magnesian limestone; soft, fast-weathering, prone to landslips. Eventually, storms and sea level rise will send this narrow remnant of wilderness crashing down on to the shore. Every winter, waves chew away at the raised beach that protects the cliffs. A flicker of wings catches my eye: two small birds, flitting skywards to catch flies. They are hard to identify with the sun in my eyes and lead me a merry dance as I try to get closer. Following them back along the path, I finally see that they are stonechats. The male’s breast feathers are the colour of a glowing ember.

279;279;5523;5523;Scott Morrison’s dereliction of duty over rapid Covid tests is a threat to Australians’ public safety | Kevin Rudd;2022-01-05T05:26:17Z;['Kevin Rudd'];['Scott Morrison', 'Coronavirus', 'Australia news', 'Health', 'Australian election 2022'];"Scott Morrison’s bloody-minded refusal to fund rapid Covid-19 tests is misguided, expensive and dangerous. It is just one more example of the Liberal leader putting his own crude political interests ahead of public safety. There are no silver bullets to end a pandemic. The public understand that. Vaccines are an important weapon. But only because they let us move from the blunt instrument of citywide lockdowns to a combination of other, more targeted and inter-locking public health measures. This includes an effective regime of testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine. All these elements must work together. Morrison’s dereliction of leadership responsibility for Australia’s testing regime, with queues snaking through city streets and rapid antigen tests being hawked online at extortionate prices, is one more addition to the many errors that have come before it. At every stage of the pandemic, Morrison has had to be dragged into half-hearted action – with catastrophic consequences. Morrison has been obsessed with picking political fights instead of his government’s core responsibilities like quarantine and aged care. Almost 1,000 Australians have now died in commonwealth-regulated aged care homes that were meant to keep them safe.
In this pivotal stage of the pandemic, it is in everyone’s interest to ensure every Australian, regardless of their income, has access to free at-home rapid antigen test kits. This is because every time a positive case is identified, it provides the chance to staunch a chain of infection and keep bending the curve so that our hospitals aren’t overrun. Morrison’s myriad arguments against free rapid tests range from the hypocritical to the obscene. First, Morrison insists the Treasury cannot afford it. This is patently ridiculous. Let’s not forget how Morrison wasted an eye-watering $40bn in JobKeeper payments to companies that didn’t need it – enough to buy every Australian household a dozen tests every month into 2024! Morrison’s position on rapid tests is ultimately a false economy because mass-testing saves money in the long run. Public hospitals can easily spend more than $100,000 invasively ventilating an intensive care patient, or the chain of infection can be detected and halted weeks earlier using a cheap rapid test. Second, Morrison points to conventional PCR laboratory tests as fully subsidised alternative. Apart from the mammoth queues to access a PCR test, these tests are much more expensive to taxpayers. For every PCR test conducted by a private laboratory, Medicare is charged $85; by comparison, rapid tests generally cost about $10 (even less when the government is buying millions of units in bulk). Put another way, for every rapid test that displaces a PCR test, taxpayers would save at least $70. Third, Morrison draws a distinction between medicine, which he says should be funded, and tests, which he says shouldn’t. This is hogwash.
Since 1991, successive federal governments have funded free breast and cervical cancer screenings. John Howard expanded on these programs by including at-home bowel cancer tests. The fact that Morrison’s own government is conducting a feasibility study on free lung cancer screenings suggests he has no objection. Australia’s world-leading response to HIV/Aids also hinged on providing vulnerable groups with free testing, treatment, condoms and clean needles. Fourth, the government warns it cannot possibly meet Australians’ insatiable appetite for free tests – a statement that is grounded in a deeply elitist perspective on public health behaviours by lower income Australians. Federal health minister, Greg Hunt, and Morrison talk down to Australians as though they are either hypochondriacs addicted to shoving cotton swabs up their nostrils, or charlatans determined to cheat government programs. They suddenly insist on price signals to ensure people don’t seek help unless they are truly desperate. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Morrison might find this hard to imagine, but not every household has an extra $25 saved for a rapid test when they need it. This is a recipe for massive undetected spread among those Australians least able to pay. Finally, Morrison says he won’t “undercut” businesses trying to make a buck out of these tests. This is a total abrogation of responsibility, leaving public health at the mercy of price-gouging companies who – unlike Morrison – listened to experts’ warnings of a looming spike in demand. The fundamental principle of Medicare is that Australians deserve access to healthcare based on their needs, not their ability to fulfil the needs of the market. If Morrison wants to ensure Australians can find rapid tests at their local shops, that’s good; he should involve those businesses in delivering publicly funded testing kits. But since Morrison’s stated motivation is to avoid “undercutting” their profits, it seems he’s forgotten who he works for.
One of the few things that unites most Australians is our revulsion at the hideous inequities of the American health system; Morrison’s apparent fondness for mingling business with healthcare suggests he doesn’t share that view. Why then has Morrison taken this hypocritical and unsustainable position? I suspect three reasons. Morrison may be trying to ease fears ahead of the election. Australians are watching rising case numbers with trepidation and soaring positive test rates – now more than 20% in most states – suggest there are many more cases lurking beneath the surface.
If Morrison cannot reduce the numbers in reality, he can reduce the numbers that are announced in the media each day. As Donald Trump once claimed, “if you don’t test, you won’t have any cases”. Morrison also knows voters have now seen through the myth of Liberals being superior economic managers. Morrison is now the biggest-spending postwar prime minister with record debt and record deficit. National debt is set to reach $1.3tn – more than seven-times the Labor government’s supposed “debt bomb” of $189bn in 2013 – equivalent to 55% of GDP, compared with 12% when we left office. Morrison’s performative austerity on rapid tests is a feeble attempt to regain some fiscal credibility. Finally, Morrison now stakes this public position on a thread-bare ideology of “personal responsibility”. He’s borrowed this from his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, who thought he could politically skate through the latest UK debacle. But it’s also political code language for a Darwinian survival-of-the-fittest contest in which the weak, the poor and the vulnerable are cast aside. Perhaps that’s what Morrison really meant when he said of rapid tests, “someone’s always going to pay for it, and it’s going to be you”. Once we had Medicare. Now we have MorrisonCare.

280;280;5524;5524;Scientists hope to unravel mystery of Sicily’s child mummies;2022-01-05T05:00:32Z;['Daniel Boffey'];['Italy', 'Archaeology', 'Europe', 'Science', 'World news'];"The 200-year-old secrets of the child mummies of the Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo in northern Sicily are to be revealed by a British-led team of scientists using X-ray technology. Dr Kirsty Squires, of Staffordshire University, will head a first attempt to tell the stories of some of the 163 children whose remains lie within the corridors and crypts of the famous underground tomb. The Catacombs contain 1,284 mummified and skeletonised bodies, the largest collection of mummies in Europe. While many of the children contained there are now skeletal, others have been described as appearing as if they are sleeping. The two-year investigation will focus on the children who died between 1787 and 1880 and, initially, on 41 bodies residing within a bespoke “child chapel”. None of the children’s identity, cause of death and medical history is known, and descriptive tags attached to them have long eroded away. It is hoped that a better picture about the children’s lives and passing will be revealed by cross-referencing the anatomical findings with archival records, including two books containing names and years of death. “We are going in January to carry out our fieldwork,” Squires said. “We will take a portable X-ray unit and take hundreds of images of the children from different angles. “We are hoping to better understand their development, health and identity, comparing the biological fundings with the more cultural kind of things: the way the individuals have been mummified and the clothes they are wearing as well.” The catacombs, once solely for the deceased friars of the Capuchin order, have become a popular, if macabre, tourist attraction, with every niche and crevice bearing bodies on open display. The preserved dead were often dressed in their finery and would be visited by their relatives.
The friars first established themselves at the church of Santa Maria della Pace in 1534. They created a mass grave for their dead which opened like a tank under an altar but, when that became full, the deceased were held in a vault, or charnel house, while a new crypt was dug. When it came to relocate the bodies from the overfull vault, 45 of the deceased friars exhumed were found to have been naturally mummified, with their faces recognisable, a development that was taken to be an act of God. Rather than bury the remains, the bodies were displayed as relics, propped in niches along the walls of the first corridor of the new cemetery. In 1787, a letter was published stating that everyone, including children, in the region had the right to be accommodated in the catacombs after death. Almost all the research until today has been on the adult mummies, excepting a headline-grabbing examination of Rosalia Lombardo, who died of pneumonia a week shy of her second birthday on 6 December 1920. Her startlingly complete preservation was investigated a decade ago by Dr Dario Piombino-Mascali, who is working with Squires on the latest project at the catacombs. He said: “Many of the mummies are a result of natural dehydration. Other mummies were chemically treated. Those chemically treated are normally better preserved. “Some of them are superbly preserved. Some really look like sleeping children. They are darkened by the time but some of them have got even fake eyes so they seem to be looking at you. They look like tiny little dolls. “Of course you want to do something to preserve them and to make sure their stories are told and give a sense that they are children. It is very upsetting when you deal with children in anthropology.” Radiographic images – 14 per mummy, from head-to-toe – will be taken and examined by Dr Robert Loynes, a retired orthopaedic surgeon who has previously investigated ancient Egyptian mummies. Piombino-Mascali said it was vital that the work on the fragile corpses was “non invasive”. Images will be drawn by an artist from Los Angeles, Eduardo Hernandez, who will produce illustrations for use in educational leaflets for handing out at the catacombs and elsewhere. The project has received over £70,000 in funding from the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council. The last bodies interned in the catacombs died in the early 20th century.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/sicily-palermo-child-mummies-scientists-hope-unravel-mystery;6
281;281;5525;5525;‘People said I didn’t have enough talent’: the rise of Italy’s graphic novel gonzo;2022-01-05T05:00:32Z;['Lorenzo Tondo'];['Italy', 'Animation on TV', 'Books', 'Netflix', 'Europe', 'Television', 'Culture', 'World news', 'Television & radio'];"Michele Rech is uncomfortable with success. The shy 38-year-old comic book artist, who works from a modest apartment on the outskirts of Rome, does not use the word “fame” but refers instead to his rise to national prominence as a “thing” he struggles to manage. In the art world, he is known as Zerocalcare and is the cartoonist’s equivalent of Hunter S Thompson. Rech’s graphic novels are a form of gonzo journalism – inspired by his own adventures as a protester on the frontlines of police violence in Italy, and in Syria, where he was embedded with Kurdish forces. This year, Netflix released an adaptation of his most well-loved cartoons, in which Rech struggles with grief and job insecurity, all while a giant armadillo represents his imaginary conscience. Last month, the series topped the streaming charts in Italy, ahead of South Korea’s hit show Squid Game. Rech’s career began in 2001 when he chronicled the bloody riots during the Genoa G8 summit in which the Italian police severely beat anti-globalism protesters. He was just 17 at the time and was among the demonstrators.
“That experience was overwhelming,” says Rech. “I sensed that anyone with a uniform wanted to kill us all. A year later they arrested 25 protesters who were accused of vandalism. The brutality wasn’t enough; they wanted to put behind bars those who took part in the protests. I needed to tell what happened. That’s where it all started.” The aim of Rech’s first short comic book, La Nostra Storia alla Sbarra (Our Story in the Dock), was to use proceeds from its sales to offset the legal costs of the young Italians arrested during the turmoil in Genoa. He used for the first time his pen name, Zerocalcare, meaning “zero limescale”, inspired by a catchy jingle for a TV commercial for a descaler solution. He chose the name in a rush – it was the first thing that came to mind. “I never thought that being a comic artist could be my main source of income,” said Rech, who used to work as an after-school tutor. “Also because many people told me I didn’t have enough talent to become a cartoonist.” In 2010, Rech began working on his debut graphic novel, The Armadillo’s Prophecy. In it, Zerocalcare recounts mourning the death of a classmate, interspersed with Italian cultural stereotypes, in the presence of the giant armadillo. It was turned down by dozens of publishers but one startup company, Bao, believed in the concept and in 2012, 500 copies were printed. The book went on to be reprinted 24 times and has sold more than 150,000 copies. It was Rech’s first step toward renown among Italian cartoonists.
The second was a 3,600km journey, when in 2014, Islamic State launched an attack in northern Syria. Rech, who was supportive of the Kurdish cause, made several trips to the city of Kobani in northern Syria to recount the resistance of the female fighters against IS. The result of those experiences culminated in his 2015 book, Kobane calling: Greetings from Northern Syria. His success has continued to build and now on Netflix there is his offbeat animated series, Tear Along the Dotted Line, which follows the existential vicissitudes of a socially awkward cartoonist (Rech’s own avatar) with his armadillo-cum-conscience reflecting on his life’s path. “I was obsessed with the idea of creating an animated series,” says Rech. “First of all, for the music. I had always mentioned my musical suggestions in my comics, but I knew many people would never listen to them. So I wanted people to listen to my things. I sent Netflix hundreds of emails, until they finally caved in. They allowed me free rein to decide the content as I pleased.” The series, in which Rech performs the voiceover for all his characters, except for the armadillo, which is performed by the Italian actor Valerio Mastandrea, has become the most-watched show on Netflix in Italy. The Turkish didn’t like the inclusion in the series of the PKK Kurdish flag, deemed outrageous by Ankara, which considers the organisation a terrorist group. “Those are the flags of the people who liberated northern Syria from IS,” says Rech, “of those who gave their lives to fight Islamic fundamentalism.”
Today Zerocalcare is one of the most trending hashtags on Italian social media. The crowds that gather at his book signings resemble the queues outside concerts and can last hours. “The last time I signed copies of my comic books it lasted 14 hours,” he says. “It’s extenuating, but I want my relationship with readers to be as transparent as possible. Some people say I should hire an agent who says ‘no’, and that I should only sign the first 40 copies. I’d feel like I’d be delegating dirty work to someone else. But it would be an injustice and I’d feel guilty.” Rech follows a strict subculture of hardcore punk called “straight edge”, whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco and drugs, and says it helps him to deal with the recent barrage of success.
He is glad things are going well but adds, “I just have to learn that things aren’t the way they were a month ago. And maybe it’s not easy for someone like me.” For a good understanding of Rech’s personality, there is a scene in the TV series that represents the artist’s philosophy of life. Returning home after a night with his would-be-love, Zerocalcare finds the armadillo, his alter ego, sitting on a chair while sipping a herbal tea. Before Zero closes the door, the armadillo asks him if he has had sex. “No,” answers the protagonist. The armadillo replies: “You’re a black belt at dodging life.’’";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/zerocalcare-michele-rech-people-said-i-didnt-have-enough-talent-the-rise-of-italys-graphic-novel-gonzo;5
282;282;5526;5526;New evidence of Belgian complicity in 1961 killing of Burundian PM;2022-01-05T05:00:32Z;['Jennifer Rankin'];['Burundi', 'Belgium', 'Colonialism', 'Africa', 'Europe', 'World news'];"A popular prime minister of Burundi, Prince Louis Rwagasore, was shot dead just over 60 years ago with the complicity of Belgium, the departing colonial power, a researcher has claimed. The Belgian state has an “overwhelming responsibility” for the assassination of Rwagasore, according to Ludo De Witte, a Flemish sociologist who has spent five years investigating the killing. His previous work on the assassination of Congo’s first elected prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, led to a parliamentary inquiry that concluded Belgium had a “moral responsibility” for the death of the charismatic leader. His new book, Murder in Burundi, explores unseen documents from archives in Brussels and London that expose Belgium’s hand in Rwagasore’s assassination, an event that shattered peace between ethnic groups, leading to decades of war and instability in the landlocked central African country. The story unfolds on the terrace of the restaurant Tanganyika in Bujumbura on Friday 13 October 1961, where Rwagasore was dining with ministers and allies. The 29-year-old son of one of Burundi’s last kings had been swept to power barely three weeks earlier in a landslide victory that had stunned the Belgian elite.
A conservative aristocrat and a democrat with a knack for political organising, Rwagasore wanted to unite Burundi’s different ethnic groups – the Hutus, Tutsi and Gangwas – in true independence from Belgium, the colonial power since 1918. His plans were never realised. He had been prime minister for only 16 days when he was shot. The killer and his accomplices were quickly caught and tried. The man who pulled the trigger, Jean Kageorgis, a Greek national, was executed on 30 June 1962, the day before Burundi’s independence. Five accomplices were put to death six months later. De Witte argues that the role of the Belgian state was never properly examined, not by the Belgian colonial court, the newly independent government of Burundi, or the United Nations, which all conducted inquiries into the killing. De Witte sees differences in the culpability of the Belgian elite in the two assassinations he has investigated. In the case of Lumumba, killed also in 1961, the Belgian elite had “a direct and concrete responsibility in the assassination”, De Witte said. In the case of Rwagasore, events were orchestrated by Belgian officials in Burundi while Brussels turned a blind eye. Rwagasore’s life was in danger after his Uprona party won a crushing victory over the Christian Democrat party (CDC), which was seen as more friendly to Belgian interests. Two days after the Uprona landslide, Roberto Régnier, the Belgian resident (governor), convened a crisis meeting of senior Belgian officials and CDC allies, where he delivered a chilling message. “Rwagasore must be killed,” he said. His words were taken as an invitation by the CDC. Régnier’s words were confirmed by four participants in a 1962 investigation by the crown prosecutor of Brussels. But that report was never published and was left gathering dust until De Witte came across it. The first clue of the report’s existence was found in a dispatch from Britain’s then ambassador to Burundi, James Murray. Writing in 1962, Murray told London that some senior Belgians had had “an almost pathological hatred” of Rwagasore, who they believed would harm Belgian-Burundian relations. He recalled Régnier’s “words which go very far in the direction of incitement to murder”. Also accused is one of Belgium’s most admired diplomats, Paul-Henri Spaak, the then foreign minister who is now celebrated as a founding father of the European project, who De Witte believes turned a blind eye to what was happening. “Spaak knew that Régnier and his aides were on a war footing with Rwagasore, that they were rebelling against the United Nations decision to order free elections with the participation of Rwagasore,” he says. He also describes how King Baudouin, one of Belgium’s most popular monarchs, sought to help the assassins. He “moved heaven and earth” to commute the death sentence of the assassin to imprisonment. While some might suggest Baudouin was motivated by opposition to the death penalty, De Witte contends that the young king was heavily influenced by the ultra-conservative Catholic circle at the palace that took a pitiless attitude to anyone advocating real independence. But the picture remains incomplete. When De Witte went to examine Spaak’s archive, he found only a few document relating to Burundi for 1961. And a document he found in the African Archives in 2013 had disappeared when he went to look at it again a few years later, he says. The sources may be new but the conclusions do not surprise Burundian-Belgians. “We have known for a long time there was a crime committed by the Belgian state,” said Libérat Ntibashirakandi, a mathematics professor in Brussels who founded the Burundian Diaspora of Belgium group. “The book brings new elements of proof that Belgium was implicated in this assassination.” Belgian parliamentarians have been calling for greater access to archives since the inquiry into Lumumba’s death nearly 20 years ago. Experts repeated the “paramount importance” of declassifying the archives in October 2021 when a special commission handed over a report examining Belgium’s colonial past in Congo, Rwanda and Burundi, a project triggered by Black Lives Matter protests across Belgium. The experts acknowledged that their 689-page report paid “limited attention” to Rwanda and Burundi and called for further investigation into both countries, including Rwagasore’s assassination. After two decades studying the darkest pages of Belgium’s history, De Witte is not optimistic the commission will change much. “Among the Belgian elite there is a reticence, a real distance to confront the reality, the destructive consequences of colonisation and decolonisation,” he says. A spokesperson for Belgium’s foreign ministry did not respond directly to the charges in the book, but said: “The debate over historical reality is never over. It is perfectly legitimate, even necessary and desirable, that the historic colonial project be treated in a critical manner.” The spokesperson said the government was waiting on recommendations from the special parliamentary commission on colonisation before taking another position. Ntibashirakandi said the Belgian federal parliament needed to investigate the murder of Rwagasore, whom he sees as national hero who could have led Burundi to a very different future. “It’s important for Burundi to know the truth and for all of Belgium to recognise the mistakes of the past.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/new-evidence-of-belgian-complicity-in-1961-killing-of-burundian-pm;1
283;283;5527;5527;Okinawa may declare emergency Covid measures as virus spreads from US base;2022-01-05T03:41:58Z;['Justin McCurry'];['Japan', 'Coronavirus', 'Asia Pacific'];"Japan’s government is poised to declare a quasi-state of emergency on the southern island of Okinawa, media reports said, after a Covid-19 outbreak traced to US military bases spread to the civilian population. The prime minister, Fumio Kishida, could announce the measures this week, the Mainichi newspaper said, after Okinawa officials reported 225 new cases on Tuesday, including 47 of the Omicron strain. Tokyo, by comparison, registered 151 new infections.
The Okinawa figures do not include 164 new infections discovered at US bases on the island, bringing the total of American military infections in the latest outbreak to more than 1,000. The governor of Okinawa, Denny Tamaki, has publicly criticised US forces for failing to contain an outbreak at a base last month that quickly spread to other military facilities on the island. The first Omicron case among civilians has been traced to a local man who is employed at a US base.
The emergency measures, which could include limits on bar and restaurant opening hours, would be the first of their kind in Japan since late September, when the government lifted emergency restrictions that had been in place in parts of the country for much of the year. While cases in Japan are low compared with those in the US, Britain and parts of Europe, the number have crept up in recent days as evidence emerged of community transmission of the Omicron variant. Japan reported 1,268 new infections on Tuesday, the first time for three months that the country of 125 million people has had more than 1,000 cases a day. Tamaki told reporters that the island, which hosts more than half of the 47,000 US troops based in Japan, had entered a “sixth wave” of infections. The 225 virus cases reported on Tuesday were Okinawa’s highest in more than three months, Tamaki said, adding that infections at local US bases continued to rise. The Mainichi said Tamaki had told the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, that he was considering asking the central government to call a quasi-state of emergency.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/okinawa-may-declare-emergency-covid-measures-as-virus-spreads-from-us-base;3
284;284;5528;5528;North Korea has launched possible ballistic missile, say Japan and South Korea;2022-01-05T03:13:38Z;['Justin McCurry'];['North Korea', 'Nuclear weapons', 'Asia Pacific', 'Japan'];"North Korea fired a suspected ballistic missile early on Wednesday, the first such test by Pyongyang of the new year, drawing condemnation from Japan and calls for talks from South Korea. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and the Japanese coast guard said the projectile “appears” to be a ballistic missile, with South Korea saying it landed in the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan. The land-based missile was launched from the east coast of North Korea and flew about 500 km (310 miles) before landing in waters outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone, Japan’s defence ministry said.
The JCS said South Korean and US intelligence authorities were trying to gather more information about the launch. “Our military is maintaining readiness posture in preparation for a possible additional launch while closely monitoring the situation in close cooperation with the United States,” the JCS said in a statement. Speaking hours after the launch, the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, called for the North to engage in dialogue, voicing concern that the test would raise tensions and damage inter-Korean relations. “We should not give up the hope for dialogue in order to fundamentally overcome this situation,” Moon said at a groundbreaking ceremony for a rail line he hopes will eventually connect South and North Korea. “If both Koreas work together and build trust, peace will be achieved one day.” Moon described the rail line, in the eastern coastal city of Goseong near the North Korean border, as a “stepping stone for peace and regional balance” on the divided Korean peninsula. Wednesday’s apparent ballistic missile test is the first since October and comes at a precarious time for the North Korean regime. The country is battling food shortages and an economic crisis stemming from the long closure of its border with China during the coronavirus pandemic, while there are no signs of a resurrection of long-stalled nuclear talks with Washington. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, condemned the launch. “We find it truly regrettable that North Korea has continued to fire missiles from last year,” he told reporters. Kishida said other details were not immediately available, including where the suspected missile landed and whether it had caused any damage. He said he had ordered officials to confirm the safety of ships and planes in the area where the suspected missile likely flew and fell. South Korea’s National Security Council convened an emergency meeting, expressing concern that the launch “came at a time when internal and external stability is extremely important” and calling on North Korea to return to talks on dismantling its nuclear arsenal. While recent North Korean test launches have featured two or more missiles, Wednesday’s test appears to have involved a single projectile. The regime has tested multiple missiles in recent years, despite UN security council resolutions banning all missile and nuclear tests, and sanctions designed to weaken its ability to develop weapons of mass destruction. Its arsenal is believed to include long-range missiles capable of striking parts of the US mainland, while last year the North claimed it had successfully tested a new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile; a long-range cruise missile; a train-launched weapon; and what it described as a hypersonic warhead. North Korea has not tested an intercontinental ballistic missile since 2017, apparently to avoid inviting further sanctions, but appears determined to apply pressure on Washington with launches of smaller missiles. In addition, the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, did not publicly appear at any missile tests or military drills last year – the first time he has been absent during his decade in power.
The latest test comes as North Korea remains silent on US appeals for talks. At a key meeting of the North’s ruling party last week, Kim – who has overseen rapid progress in military technology – vowed to continue to bolster its military capabilities but did not refer to the US. The two countries have not has held denuclearisation talks since the collapse in 2019 of the dialogue between Kim and the then US president, Donald Trump. Under Joe Biden, the US has repeatedly said it is willing to meet North Korean representatives without preconditions, but insists it will not give up on denuclearisation. But Pyongyang has so far dismissed the offer, accusing Washington of pursuing “hostile” policies, including joint military drills with the South it regards as rehearsals for an invasion.
“Rather than expressing willingness for denuclearisation talks or interest in an end-of-war declaration, North Korea is signalling that neither the Omicron variant nor domestic food shortages will stop its aggressive missile development,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. According to a statement released on Tuesday night, the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff called South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Lee Sun Jin, to express their “ironclad commitment to the US-Republic of Korea alliance” while also discussing military response options. Japan’s foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, and its defence minister, Nobuo Kishi, will hold talks with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin via video link on Friday, the foreign ministry said in a statement. Discussions will centre on the overall security situation faced by the allies as well as those concerning “a free and open Indo-Pacific,” it added. In a report released last month, the US government’s Congressional Research Service concluded that North Korea was continuing to advance its nuclear weapons and missile programmes despite UN sanctions and diplomatic efforts. “Recent ballistic missile tests and military parades suggest that North Korea is continuing to build a nuclear war-fighting capability designed to evade regional ballistic missile defences,” the report said.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/north-korea-missile-launch-japan;4
285;285;5529;5529;Biden to ‘speak truth’ on Capitol attack as Trump cancels anniversary event;2022-01-05T02:39:46Z;['N/A'];['US Capitol attack', 'Joe Biden', 'US news', 'Donald Trump', 'US politics', 'Republicans'];"Joe Biden will mark the first anniversary of the deadly assault at the US Capitol this Thursday by honoring the bravery of law enforcement on the scene, and outlining the unfinished work the nation needs to do to strengthen its democracy, the White House said in its first preview of the president’s remarks. “On Thursday, the president is going to speak to the truth of what happened, not the lies that some have spread since, and the peril it has posed to the rule of law and our system of democratic governance,” the White House spokesperson, Jen Psaki, told reporters on Tuesday afternoon. The preview came as Donald Trump announced he was cancelling his own anniversary event, a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida that had been scheduled for the evening of 6 January. Several Republicans had expressed concerns about Trump’s news conference overshadowing the somber day. The former president blasted the House committee investigating the 6 January insurrection, which continues its work and on Tuesday issued a letter seeking the cooperation of the Fox New host Sean Hannity, who exchanged messages with Trump and his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, in the days leading up to the attack.
In a statement, Trump said that he was cancelling his conference “in light of the total bias and dishonesty of the January 6th Unselect Committee of Democrats, two failed Republicans, and the Fake News Media”, and would address the issue instead at a rally on 15 January. Biden and Kamala Harris will speak on Thursday morning at the US Capitol, one year after a mob loyal to Trump raided the complex in a failed attempt to stop the counting of electoral college votes that officially delivered Biden’s election victory. Trump, fellow Republicans and rightwing media personalities have pushed false and misleading accounts to downplay the attack, calling it a non-violent protest or blaming leftwing activists. Four people died on the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the day after defending Congress. Dozens of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives. Biden will put an extra spotlight on the role of Capitol police and others on the scene, Psaki said. “Because of their efforts, our democracy withstood an attack from a mob, and the will of more than 150 million people who voted in the presidential election was ultimately registered by Congress,” Psaki said. Psaki was asked what the president’s message will be to the many Republicans who believe Biden stole the election from Trump, despite overwhelming contrary evidence. “What he’s going to continue to do is speak to everyone in the country. Those who didn’t vote for him, those who may not believe he is the legitimate president, about what he wants to do to make their lives better,” Psaki said.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/us-capitol-attack-biden-trump-event;1
286;286;5530;5530;Video shows police dog severely mauls Uber driver who missed car payments;2022-01-05T01:28:01Z;['Dani Anguiano', 'Johana Bhuiyan'];['California', 'US policing', 'San Francisco', 'Uber', 'US news'];"Newly released video footage appears to show California police officers using a law enforcement dog to severely maul an Uber driver, who fell behind on payments for the car he rented to do his job. San Ramon police stopped Ali Badr, a 42-year-old Egyptian immigrant, in December 2020 after a rental company reported his vehicle as stolen. In footage obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle, police in the Bay Area city can be seen releasing the dog on the unarmed and barefoot driver without warning within seconds of stopping him, even though Badr was not resisting. The dog clamped down on Badr’s right arm for nearly a minute, mangling him so severely that he required multiple surgeries. In a lawsuit filed last month, Badr, who was never charged, said he was left with “severe physical and psychological injuries” and has not regained full use of his arm and hand since the incident.
“All of them are talking to me at one time,” Badr told the Chronicle. “They’re yelling at me, and all of them have guns out. I did what they say exactly.” The case has cast a harsh light not only on the tactics of the police department but on the rental arrangements utilized by rideshare companies such as Uber and Lyft. Badr, who was a social worker in Egypt before moving to the US, previously drove for Uber and Lyft with his own vehicle, but he could no longer afford the payments after the pandemic reduced his income, the newspaper reported. In August 2020, according to the lawsuit, he obtained a car owned by the rental rideshare startup CarMommy via a rental agreement with HyreCar, a rental car company serving gig workers.
He fell behind on his payments toward the end of the contract, the Chronicle reported, but made arrangements to pay the company. CarMommy’s CEO, John Blomeke, reported the vehicle as stolen, which language in the contract Badr signed stipulated could happen if he fell behind on payments and “other criteria were met”, according to the newspaper. HyreCar declined to comment on the matter while Uber and CarMommy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rental agreements such as these became common as Uber and Lyft expanded across the US. Short-term car rentals through partners such as HyreCar offer fewer hoops to jump through than typical car rental arrangements, and the short-term car rentals gave Uber and Lyft access to a new pool of drivers. But some drivers have claimed that the rental arrangements can be predatory, sometimes requiring higher rental and other costs in exchange for lower pay. For some drivers like Badr, it was at times difficult to make enough to cover the monthly or weekly payments, at which point drivers were typically required to immediately return the vehicle. For many that meant losing at least one source of income and, in some cases, their temporary homes. Dash- and body-cam video shows Badr, who appears to be trying to put on his shoes, cooperating with officers’ demands during a traffic stop. But, within seconds, an officer releases the large dog who immediately bites Badr’s arm. As the dog attacks him, Badr screams and repeatedly yells “What I did? What I did?” while officers inspect the car with their guns drawn. Badr told the Chronicle that after being transported by ambulance, he was handcuffed to a hospital bed and underwent surgery for his injuries. The police department sought charges for vehicle theft and resisting arrest against Badr, but the Contra Costa district attorney in March declined to file charges due to “insufficient evidence and the interest of justice”, a DA spokesperson said. The San Ramon police department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to his lawsuit, Badr suffered “permanent and extensive” damage to his arm and hand, which are badly scarred, and has “undergone substantial mental health treatment and therapy”. The city of San Ramon, the police chief and officers are named in the lawsuit, along with HyreCar, CarMommy and company CEO Blomeke. US police dogs bite thousands of people each year and are often used on people who are not violent or suspected of minor crimes or in some cases no crimes at all, an investigation from the Marshall Project found. Victims of such attacks struggle to seek accountability as excessive force lawsuits involving dog bites are challenging to win, according to the outlet.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/uber-video-police-dog-maul-driver;4

The world Test champions were dismissed for 169 in their second innings, with Bangladesh knocking off the 40 runs required for victory for the loss of two wickets as the tourists beat New Zealand in a Test match for the first time.
The hosts had begun day five on 147 for 5, a slender lead of 17 runs, and were quickly on the back foot as the seamer Ebadot Hossain clean-bowled Ross Taylor for 40, then removed Kyle Jamieson for a duck in his first two overs. Taskin Ahmed chipped in with the wicket of the all-rounder Rachin Ravindra for 16. The Black Caps were rocking on 160 for 8 and Bangladesh finished them off, Taskin removing Tim Southee’s middle stump before Trent Boult departed for eight as he holed out in the deep. There was a brief early wobble for the tourists when Shadman Islam was caught behind for three off Southee’s bowling. Najmul Hossain Shanto and the captain, Mominul Haque, steadied the ship and by the time Najmul was caught smartly by Taylor for 17, the finish line was in sight. Mominul, who scored 13 not out, and the experienced Mushfiqur Rahim (unbeaten on five) ushered Bangladesh to their historic triumph.
Ebadot finished with second-innings figures of 6 for 46, his early wickets key to forcing a result. The former volleyball player, who is still employed by the Bangladesh Air Force, was named player of the match. “It’s a long journey, volleyball to cricket … I’m enjoying cricket now,” he said after the game. In the first innings, New Zealand had posted an impressive 328, Devon Conway top-scoring with 122, but they found themselves 130 runs behind at halfway. Bangladesh made 458 in response, with four players – Mominul (88), Liton Das (86), Mahmudul Hasan Joy (78) and Najmul (64) – reaching half-centuries. Bangladesh’s first win in any format of the game in New Zealand gives them a 1-0 lead in the two-match series, with the second Test starting in Christchurch on Sunday. The hosts will be eager to bounce back from their first home Test defeat since South Africa won at Wellington in March 2017.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/cricket-new-zealand-bangladesh-first-test-report;2
288;288;5532;5532;Labor calls for free rapid antigen tests before Australian national cabinet meeting;2022-01-05T01:07:33Z;['Sarah Martin'];['Health', 'Australian politics', 'Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Anthony Albanese', 'Scott Morrison', 'Coalition', 'Labor party', 'Tanya Plibersek', 'Annastacia Palaszczuk', 'Australian trade unions', 'Queensland', 'New South Wales', 'Dominic Perrottet'];"A Coalition plan to give the disadvantaged small cash payments to cover the cost of rapid antigen tests has been dismissed by Labor and the unions, as the government resists pressure to make the tests freely available for everyone. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the idea was “ridiculous” and finally called for the tests to be made freely available. “We have considered the options and it is clear that this is the simplest, most efficient, fairest and most responsible way to fix the mess that Scott Morrison has made of testing at this critical juncture of the pandemic,” Albanese said.
In the lead-up to Wednesday’s meeting of national cabinet, the Morrison government floated the plan in the Australian, revealing it would use the disaster payment system to give people on low incomes, welfare recipients and pensioners the funds needed to cover the cost of up to five tests. If states and territories agreed to the proposal, the funding would increase to cover the cost of 10 tests. Rapid antigen tests are understood to cost about $3 on the wholesale market but are retailing on the private market for much more due to widespread shortages. Speaking on Wednesday morning, Morrison said essential tests for those who are close contacts and symptomatic would continue to be free. “So if you’re a close contact, if you’re symptomatic, those tests are free to all Australians,” the prime minister said. “Always have been. That has never changed.” He said the government’s proposal related to “peace of mind tests” over and above essential requirements. “I’ll be putting a proposal to the premiers and chief ministers today, how we can offset the cost for those who are on commonwealth seniors health cards and pensioners, and those on healthcare cards and things of that nature to defray the costs for those that they’re seeking to get, where other Australians are buying,” Morrison said.
But the proposal has already been met with some resistance, with the Queensland premier, Annasatasia Palaszczuk, saying the new system needed to be “as easy and simple as possible”. “I haven’t seen a paper from the prime minister, I am only speaking from what I have read in the papers today, but we just need to be make it very, very simple and easy, especially to our most vulnerable people,” she said. “For our pensioners, for our health cardholders, these should be made available for free.” The cash-for-tests proposal, details of which are yet to be released, was immediately attacked as a “distraction” and an example of the prime minister again offering “too little, too late”. “Today’s attempt to distract from his ongoing failure to make rapid antigen tests free and accessible for all Australians proves that prime minister Scott Morrison still doesn’t get it,” said the Australian Council of Trade Unions acting secretary, Liam O’Brien. “Mr Morrison is planning to divide the nation by giving a small number of Australians limited access to the healthcare they need, while everyone else is left to fend for themselves. “This does nothing to help small businesses and those that work for them keep their workplaces safe and open.” The Labor deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, also criticised the plan. “Nothing says too little, too late like Scott Morrison saying he’ll give some people a subsidy to buy rapid antigen tests (at retail prices) when you can’t find one to buy,” Plibersek said on Twitter. The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, said the state had put in place a substantial order for rapid antigen tests that would begin arriving next week, and would consider making a financial contribution towards the government’s plan.
“We want to make sure those who need access to rapid antigen testing, get access to that now,” Perrottet said. “We put whatever we need in to ensure that that support is there for people right across the state. “If there’s a financial agreement that we can reach with the commonwealth government, from my perspective and the treasurer’s perspective, there is no dollar figure that we will not put on the table to ensure as we move through this next phase, rapid antigen tests are available to anybody right across the state who needs one.” When asked about providing tests free across the board, Perrottet said that would be a matter for national cabinet to consider. “Clearly, with the significant queues that we’re seeing at PCR centres, by the provision of rapid antigen tests at those centres we will see a substantial alleviation of pressure on testing, so that is something that we’re currently focused on.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
He urged people to continue to be patient at state testing queues, and said there was a need to continue to adapt as the nature of the pandemic changed. “We’re in a pandemic,” he said. “There’ll be curveballs thrown at us over the course of this period of time, but … we’ve overcome those challenges over the past two years.” A growing number of experts have been calling for the tests to be made free, including the Doherty Institute head, Sharon Lewin, who told ABC on Tuesday they should be “widely accessible and free”.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/labor-now-calls-for-free-rapid-antigen-tests-ahead-of-australian-national-cabinet-meeting;7
289;289;5534;5534;‘Thematically richer than the Bible’: what I learned at the first annual Boss Baby symposium;2022-01-05T00:45:14Z;['Toby Fehily'];['The Boss Baby', 'Film', 'Culture', 'Animation in film', 'Philosophy'];"In the middle of a question and answer session at an academic symposium, an audience member wearing a Boss Baby shirt showed off the Boss Baby lunchbox he takes to work every day. “Obviously I eat cookies for lunch,” he explained, “because that’s what Boss Baby fans do.” There was polite applause.
Boss Baby fans don’t just eat cookies for lunch – they also convene virtual philosophy conferences dedicated to the study of The Boss Baby, the 2017 DreamWorks animated film starring Alec Baldwin. Organised by Jaime McCaffrey of the University of Kentucky and Tore Levander of Fordham University, the first annual Boss Baby symposium, held online on Tuesday, brought together a wide range of thinkers to examine what we can learn from a movie about a baby who is also a boss.
Over the course of an entire afternoon, eight academics delivered presentations centred around three themes: Situating the Boss Baby in Myth and Media; Personal and Professional Growth: Work and Play in The Boss Baby; and “Not enough love for the two of us”: Birth, Motherhood, and the Lack Thereof. They were joined at the end for an informal chat with JP Karliak, voice of Boss Baby in the Netflix television series The Boss Baby: Back in Business, and its showrunner, or “Boss Baby boss baby”, Brandon Sawyer. “Frankly, we don’t know exactly what you’ll find,” the symposium’s website admitted, “but we know it will leave you thinking, ‘Yep, that was definitely a symposium dedicated to the 2017 film titled The Boss Baby.’” It was. But why The Boss Baby? Depends on who you ask. According to one of the symposium’s presenters, it’s just the continuation of a long historical lineage of boss babies – or παῖς-ἄναξ, “child leaders”, in the ancient Greek – stretching from Astyanax from The Iliad, Hikaru Genji from The Tale of Genji, King Edward V of England and Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York.
Regardless of why, there’s definitely a strong appeal at work. The film grossed half a billion dollars at the box office and has since been spun off into a 2021 sequel and four seasons of the Netflix television series. K-pop band BTS member Jimin learned English by watching the movie again and again. And when a Boss Baby balloon floated on to the 2021 Macy’s Parade, a transfixed crowd reverently chanted “Boss Baby” in near-religious supplication. Despite this semi-ironic popularity, The Boss Baby follows a plot that can be difficult to parse, not that that would discourage academics. “It might be thematically richer than the Bible and more confusing than Ulysses,” McCaffrey said in her opening remarks. In the movie, the suit-and-tie-wearing, briefcase-bearing Boss Baby is sent on a secret mission by Baby Corp, where all babies come from. He’s charged with protecting the world’s love of babies, now under threat due to increasing love for puppies instead. So he sets out to stop the CEO of Puppy Co from releasing the “Forever Puppy”, a new version of puppy that remains a puppy for life, which would destroy babydom as we know it and for some reason is going to be launched into the world via a rocket filled to bursting with puppies.
That’s a rough summary that doesn’t even touch on things like the super secret baby formula that keeps the Boss Baby eternally young while endowing him with adult faculties. It would take a PhD just to understand how that’s supposed to work, let alone to conduct a Freudian and Marxist analysis of the milk, as two academics did for the talk The Land of Milk and Money: Lactic Capital in The Boss Baby.
Perplexing as the plot may be, the first annual Boss Baby symposium urged us to not throw out the Boss Baby with the boss bathwater. By the end of the day, we’d learned about everything from intertextual references in DreamWorks movies and US attitudes towards sexuality to Erik Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development. We even sat down for a serious chat about Boss Baby’s “narcissistic and psychotic orientation”, which, to be fair, doesn’t really seem like a rare phenomenon among upper management. It was during a presentation on the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre’s concept of play that it all twigged for me. The speaker had been arguing that an authentic existential attitude is predicated on a synthesis of facticity (boss) and transcendence (baby). I realised that the symposium itself embodied what it means to truly be both boss and baby. The presentations were both tongue-in-cheek larks for a laugh and sincere explorations of the speakers’ areas of expertise. There was genuine affection for the film, as well as a willingness to make fun of it. It was serious (boss), but it was also silly (baby). I wouldn’t go so far as to say that the answers to all of life’s questions can be found in The Boss Baby, but, like the occasional cookie for lunch, it doesn’t hurt.

291;291;5536;5536;Philadelphia QB Jalen Hurts urges NFL to act over Washington barrier collapse;2022-01-05T00:39:29Z;['Guardian sport'];['NFL', 'Washington Commanders', 'Philadelphia Eagles', 'Sport', 'US sports'];"In an open letter, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts has called on the NFL and the Washington Football Team to improve safety measures at FedExField after a railing collapsed at the stadium on Sunday. In a video that circulated on social media, Hurts was seen walking off the field after the game in Landover, Maryland. Visiting Eagles fans reaching out for a high five were sent tumbling to the ground after a barrier gave way. Hurts has now asked “what follow-up action is being considered” after the incident.
“Many individuals, including fans, media personnel, and myself, were placed in a dangerous situation when portions of the FedExField tunnel collapsed,” Hurts wrote. “Although I was able to prevent the barrier from crashing onto me, that was not the same for others who could be suffering from lingering injuries.” “Through the initial shock, my first reaction was to assist those involved,” the 23-year-old added. “I understand the severity of what happened and am extremely concerned for the well-being of the fans and media.”
“I would like to know what safeguards the NFL and the Washington Football Team are implementing to prevent this from ever occurring in the future,” Hurts continued. “What happened on Sunday put both fans and players unnecessarily at risk.” A spokesperson for Washington has said the team president, Jason Wright, has responded to Hurts’ letter. In a statement released after the incident took place, the team said: “to our knowledge, everyone involved was offered onsite medical evaluation and left the stadium of their own accord.
“We’re very glad no one appears to have been seriously injured,” the statement added. “The safety of our fans and guests is of the utmost importance and we are looking into what occurred.” However, some of the fans involved have disputed WFT’s claim that they were offered a medical evaluation. On Tuesday, the NFL did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters after Hurts’ letter. The Eagles won Sunday’s game at FedExField by 20-16, helping clinch their spot in the playoffs.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/philadelphias-jalen-hurts-writes-to-nfl-washington-barrier-collapse;4
292;292;5537;5537;The 5G fight: why US phone firms are at loggerheads with FAA over airline safety;2022-01-05T00:10:54Z;['N/A'];['AT&T', 'Verizon Communications', 'Telecommunications industry', 'Business', 'Pete Buttigieg', 'US news', 'Airline industry'];"Late Monday, Verizon and AT&T agreed to a two-week delay rolling out their new 5G technology.
The technology was slated to launch on Wednesday, but in response to fears that the 5G service will impair airline safety – and amid threats from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ground or divert flights at a time when the travel industry is already playing catch-up from recent weather and Covid-related flight disruptions – the telecom companies agreed to a pause. Here’s what you need to know about the controversy: What is 5G? 5G is the newest generation of cellular network, following 4G, which was introduced in late 2009 and is used on most US cellphones today. Nearly every 10 years since 1980, a new generation network has arrived, offering faster speeds and expanded capabilities. At the simplest level, 1G allowed for phone calls, 2G brought messaging, and 3G provided internet access. Today, on 4G, users can download apps, stream video, and more, with relative ease and speed. The fifth generation is expected to offer new levels of speed – making it possible, for example, to download a movie to one’s phone in seconds – and allow more devices to be connected to a network at once. The latter is increasingly important in our crowded cellular landscape. (Ever been in a concert or stadium unable to send messages?) “Those types of data rates could enable virtual reality applications or autonomous driving cars,” Harish Krishnaswamy, an associate professor of electrical engineering at Columbia University, told Live Science. Why is the US airline industry concerned about 5G? To execute the upgrade, cellular networks plan to move operations on to a new band of radio frequencies called the C-Band. Last year, Verizon and AT&T spent a combined $67bn acquiring the C-Band spectrum licenses needed to upgrade their networks to 5G, according to Forbes. But some aircraft regulators worry that planes’ radio altimeters, which measure how far above ground a plane is to help pilots land their crafts in low-visibility situations and also operate on C-Band frequencies, could be disturbed by 5G. Can 5G and the aviation industry coexist? The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the FAA and telecom carriers all agree that 5G and airline travel can exist together. In fact, they already do in nearly 40 countries. The telecom companies have pointed out that there have not been any accidents in other countries where 5G is operational and American airlines regularly fly to those countries. The FAA, too, has said that “5G and aviation have safely coexisted in other countries”. That’s because in those regions, “power levels have been reduced around airports and the industries have worked together prior to deployment”, the agency said in a 3 January statement. So what’s the problem in the US? The discussions over how the transition should take place in the US, however, have been brewing for years and intensified in recent months. Verizon and AT&T had initially planned to launch 5G in December and until last week, appeared unwilling to postpone it further. But amid pushes from both Steve Dickson, the head of the FAA, and the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, to delay the rollout to allow for further coordination, they relented on Monday. Both companies have proposed several measures to mitigate the possible impact of the switch to 5G, including reducing the strength of their 5G around airports and helipads, and operating 5G service at lower power levels nationwide for the first six months. The FAA has thanked the companies for those proposals, but said the pause remained necessary to create “additional time and space to reduce flight disruptions associated with this 5G deployment”. It remains unclear what specific actions will be taken in the two-week period. “At Secretary Buttigieg’s request, we have voluntarily agreed to one additional two-week delay of our deployment of C-Band 5G services,” an AT&T spokesperson said by email. “We also remain committed to the six-month protection zone mitigations we outlined in our letter. We know aviation safety and 5G can coexist and we are confident further collaboration and technical assessment will allay any issues.” “While the airline industry faces many challenges, 5G is not one of them,” Hans Vestberg, chairman and CEO of Verizon, said in an email to employees today. “In November, we agreed to pause activation until January to give the FAA more time for their analysis. We also voluntarily offered to implement a number of temporary proactive protective measures, including reducing 5G power levels near airports and directing 5G nodes away from airports … Despite our efforts and the overwhelming scientific data, the FAA still has not resolved all of its questions.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/5g-fight-att-verizon-loggerheads-faa;2
293;293;5538;5538;Blood test could help detect cancer in people with nonspecific symptoms;2022-01-05T00:05:26Z;['Linda Geddes'];['Cancer', 'Medical research', 'Science', 'Health', 'Society'];Scientists have developed a blood test that could help detect cancer in people with nonspecific symptoms such as unexplained weight loss or fatigue. If validated, the test could enable cancer patients to be identified earlier, when they are more likely to respond to treatment, and help flag up who could benefit from early access to drugs designed to tackle metastatic cancer. The test can also tell if the disease has spread. There is currently no clear route through which someone with nonspecific symptoms that could be cancer is referred for further investigation. NHS rapid diagnostic centres are being set up to support faster and earlier cancer diagnosis, but often patients will be examined by their GP, and if they can’t identify an obvious cause of their symptoms then the patient will simply be told to come back if they get worse. “The problem we’ve had in the past is that if they do have cancer, that cancer is growing all the time, and when they come back the cancers are often quite advanced,” said Dr James Larkin, of the University of Oxford, who was involved in the research. Although it is difficult to know precisely how many individuals fall into this category, “it is likely to be tens of thousands of patients across the UK,” Larkin said. “We’re hoping to capture these patients when they come to the GP, to give them an immediate referral option. “The moment you can say ‘you have a cancer’, it provides a strong incentive to send that patient for an imaging investigation to see if you can find that cancer.” The new test utilises a technology called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which profiles levels of small molecules called metabolites in the blood. Healthy individuals have different metabolic “fingerprints” to those with localised or metastatic cancer. In a study published in the journal Clinical Cancer Research, Larkin and colleagues analysed samples from 300 patients with nonspecific but concerning symptoms of cancer, such as fatigue and weight loss, and found that the test correctly detected cancer in 19 out of every 20 of those with the disease. It cannot yet pinpoint the type of tumour they have, but this is the ultimate goal. The test could also distinguish between patients with localised or metastatic cancer with 94% accuracy, making this the first blood test to be able to detect if a person’s cancer has spread without knowing type of tumour they have. “Such information changes how you treat patients,” Larkin said. For instance, certain immunotherapies have been shown to increase survival rates among people with metastatic cancer, but they are expensive and have side-effects. “We don’t want to prescribe them to everyone, but there are patients out there that would absolutely benefit if you could only identify them early enough. A different type of blood test that aims to detect circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is being trialled in the NHS, but metabolic changes may be detectable earlier, while ctDNA technology also requires you to know which mutations to look for when finding a tumour. The next step is to confirm the accuracy of the test in 2,000 to 3000 British patients with nonspecific symptoms, which Larkin hopes could happen within the next two years. This data would then be submitted to national regulatory agencies responsible for authorising such tests.;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/blood-test-could-help-detect-cancer-in-people-with-nonspecific-symptoms;6
294;294;5539;5539;Macron declares his Covid strategy is to ‘piss off’ the unvaccinated;2022-01-04T23:17:15Z;['Jon Henley'];['Coronavirus', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'France', 'Europe', 'World news'];"Emmanuel Macron has prompted a furore after saying that his government’s vaccination strategy is to “piss off” people who have not had coronavirus jabs by continuing to make daily life more and more difficult for them. “I am not about pissing off the French people,” the president said in an interview with readers of Le Parisien on Tuesday. “But as for the non-vaccinated, I really want to piss them off. And we will continue to do this, to the end. This is the strategy.” Macron’s remarks came as the French parliament debated new legislation that, if passed, will mean only the fully vaccinated – and no longer those with a negative Covid test – will qualify for the country’s health pass from next month. The pass, introduced this summer, is required in France for access to indoor public places such as cafes, restaurants, cinemas, museums, concert venues and sports centres, as well as to board long-distance trains and planes. “In a democracy, the worst enemies are lies and stupidity,” Macron said. “We are putting pressure on the unvaccinated by limiting, as much as possible, their access to activities in social life.” France has vaccinated almost 90% of its population who are eligible, Macron said, and it was “only a very small minority who are resisting. How do we reduce that minority? We reduce it – sorry for the expression – by pissing them off even more.” The president, who said he wanted to run for a second term in presidential elections in April but would not make his decision public until “the health situation allows”, added that he was “not going to jail [the unvaccinated], or forcibly vaccinate them.” So, he said, “we have to tell them: from 15 January, you will no longer be able to go to the restaurant. You will no longer be able to go for a coffee, you will no longer be able to go to the theatre. You will no longer be able to go to the cinema.” Macron added: “When my freedoms threaten those of others, I become someone irresponsible. Someone irresponsible is not a citizen.”
Macron’s political opponents accused the president – who in the early stages of his term faced accusations of arrogance, tactlessness and being out of touch from parts of the French population – of excessive language. “No health emergency justifies such words,” said Bruno Retailleau, head of the right-wing Republicans in the Senate. “Emmanuel Macron says he has learned to love the French, but it seems he especially likes to despise them.” Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally, said a president “should not say such things”, adding that the language was “not worthy of the office”and that Macron was “turning the unvaccinated into second-class citizens.” Others also criticised the proposed law. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the radical left France Insoumise party, called Macron’s language “appalling”, adding: “It’s clear the vaccine pass is a collective punishment against individual liberties.” Analysts said that while the language was crude and could prompt an extreme, possibly violent reaction from anti-vaxxers, the president’s remarks appeared to reflect a careful political calculation. Polls show a large majority of French voters are growing increasingly frustrated with the pandemic and back the vaccine pass as an effective means to end it, they said – and of those who oppose it, very few are likely to cast their ballot for Macron.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/macron-declares-his-covid-strategy-is-to-piss-off-the-unvaccinated;1
295;295;5540;5540;At least 66 people arrive in Kent after first Channel boat crossings of 2022;2022-01-04T23:15:17Z;"[""Euan O'Byrne Mulligan""]";['Refugees', 'Immigration and asylum', 'UK news'];At least 66 people have arrived on the Kent coast aboard two boats, completing the first crossings of the Channel this year. Tuesday’s latest arrivals come after more than 28,300 people crossed the Dover Strait on small vessels in 2021, three times the number for 2020. Last year’s record number, an increase of about 20,000 on 2020, came despite the UK government promising millions of pounds to French authorities to tackle the issue. Border Force and French boats were active in the Channel on Tuesday, as attempts to cross the dangerous waters renewed. Photographs taken from the Kent coast showed a small child wearing a pink onesie being carried ashore. Tim Naor Hilton, chief executive at Refugee Action, claimed the UK government’s failure to provide safe routes for refugees will only lead to more deaths. He said: “People will continue to cross the Channel in flimsy boats, and smugglers will continue to profit, unless ministers open up more routes for refugees to claim asylum here. “[In November] we saw the deadly result of their strategy of keeping people out rather than keeping people safe, when at least 27 people died near our coast. “And yet the government wants to legalise this dangerous and callous policy in its anti-refugee bill, which will only lead to more people drowning. It must wake up and scrap this bill now.” At least 28,395 people reached the UK on small boats in 2021, according to analysis by the Press Association. The busiest month for arrivals was November, when at least 6,869 people reached the UK. On 24 November, an inflatable dinghy capsized in the Channel, causing the deaths of 27 people, including a seven-year-old boy and a pregnant woman. Despite collecting its own data on small boat crossings, the Home Office refuses to release annual figures, which are instead compiled daily by journalists. Home Office minister Tom Pursglove said: “Seeking asylum for protection should not involve people asylum shopping country to country, or risking their lives by lining the pockets of criminal gangs to cross the Channel.” He said the government is “reforming” its approach by “making the tough decisions to end the overt exploitation of our laws and UK taxpayers”.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/at-least-66-people-arrive-in-kent-after-first-channel-boat-crossings-of-2022;3
296;296;5541;5541;Australian supermarkets grapple with Covid-based staff shortages;2022-01-04T23:13:33Z;['Tory Shepherd'];['Supermarkets', 'Australia news', 'Retail industry', 'Business', 'Coronavirus'];"Shelves are empty in supermarkets once again as staff shortages due to illness or isolation combine with ongoing supply chain difficulties. Australia hit the grim milestone of more than 500,000 Covid cases since the pandemic began on Tuesday. Daily cases in the states and territories continue to rise, forcing tens of thousands into quarantine and even more close contacts into isolation. Between a third and a half of Australia’s transport workers are absent every day, interrupting the supply to supermarkets, the Transport Workers Union said. The major supermarkets are all experiencing shortages of products including fruit, vegetables and meat. Union national secretary, Michael Kaine, said they had written to prime minister Scott Morrison in October asking for rapid tests for transport workers to “keep drivers on the road”. Large transport operators have told the union that up to half the workforce is missing because of Covid infections and Covid-related isolation. “(We) have a completely predictable scenario where drivers are delivering rapid tests to be sold on the shelves of supermarkets and pharmacies – but they, like most Australians, can’t access them themselves,” he said. Woolworths apologised for the lack of some products as distribution centres – particularly in Sydney – suffered from Covid absenteeism. A spokesperson said they were working to replenish stores “as quickly as possible” as case numbers increase.
“The pandemic has delivered many challenges over the past two years and will continue to do so as we move into this next phase,” the spokesperson said. “We’re currently experiencing delays with some of our stock deliveries to stores due to Covid-related impacts on our supply chain operations.” Coles also apologised and promised shelves would be restocked as soon as possible. “We are … seeing an increased number of team members being required to isolate due to household exposure to Covid while they wait for test results,” a spokesperson said. “We are continuing to monitor team member availability across our business.” Coles also said supply issues included a lack of shipping pallets and transport capacity. A global timber shortage has contributed to a lack of pallets to move goods around. The challenge has been compounded by Covid-related factory closures overseas, as well as increasing local freight costs and a looming shortage of urea, a critical component of diesel fuel. “We have been working with our suppliers and other stakeholders to address a number of supply chain issues including availability of shipping pallets and transport capacity, to ensure we can continue to provide our customers with the food and drinks they need,” the Coles spokesperson said. An Aldi spokesperson said Covid was putting additional pressure on its supply chain but that it was doing its best to minimise any disruption. A spokesperson said the company had “stringent and optimised Covid-safe plans” including rapid antigen testing in place along with a range of other measures to keep teams separated. Shoppers reported shortages of fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, and other products including toilet paper. The issues facing those products are different from the shortage of rapid antigen tests, which stem from a lack of supply altogether.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/australian-supermarkets-grapple-with-covid-based-staff-shortages;2
297;297;5542;5542;Californians could face $500 fines for wasting water under new rules;2022-01-04T23:02:38Z;['N/A'];['California', 'Drought', 'Water', 'Environment', 'US news'];"Californians will not be able to water their lawns for 48 hours after rainstorms or let their sprinklers run on to the sidewalk under new, mandatory water saving rules that could result in a fine of up to $500 a day. The restrictions, adopted by state regulators on Tuesday, come as California continues to struggle under drought conditions, despite a recent wave of heavy rain and snow.
The rules could take effect as soon as the end of the month, though regulators stressed they want to encourage voluntary conservation and that it will be up to local authorities to decide on whether to enforce fines. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, had previously called for residents to voluntarily reduce water use by 15% compared with last year, but the state has continued to fall short. Between July and November, the state’s water usage went down just 6%. Among the water uses that will not be allowed under the new rules: outdoor watering that results in excessive runoff into the street and sidewalks; using water for landscaping and irrigation during the 48 hours after storms that bring at least 0.25in (0.63cm) of rain; washing cars with hoses lacking shut-off nozzles; using potable water to wash driveways, sidewalks, buildings and patios and for street cleaning or to fill decorative fountains or lakes. There are some exceptions. For example, trees in street medians can be watered, while turf cannot. The rules will take effect once an administrative review is completed. The new restrictions come after an extremely wet December that state officials warned may not continue during the winter months. Weather patterns have become more unpredictable due to the climate crisis and state climatologist Michael Anderson said forecasts show January, February and March could be drier than average. The wet December has offered some reprieve in the water crisis: in mid-December, about 80% of California was in extreme or exceptional drought conditions, but by the end of the month only about a third was experiencing those conditions, according to the US Drought Monitor. Despite the rain, significant parts of the state’s water system are still under stress from the extremely dry conditions earlier in 2021 that dropped many of California’s largest reservoirs to record and near-record lows. “Conserving water and reducing water waste are critical and necessary habits for everyone to adopt as we adjust to these uncertainties and we build resilience to climate change, so adopting emergency regulations now just makes sense,” said Eric Oppenheimer, the chief deputy director for the state water board. “We need to be prepared for continued drought.” Northern California was wetter than southern California in November and conserved significantly more water. Regions north of the San Joaquin River, including Sacramento and San Francisco, used between 17% and 26% less water than November 2020, while Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties that account for 55% of the state’s population used nearly 1% more, according to state data. The state adopted similar restrictions during the five-year drought that ended in 2017, and some cities and local water districts made them permanent. State water board officials were unable to say how many of California’s nearly 40 million people are under such rules or exactly how much water they expect to save.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/california-drought-fines-water-restrictions;5
298;298;5543;5543;Non-urgent surgery and appointments paused across Greater Manchester;2022-01-04T22:55:59Z;"[""Euan O'Byrne Mulligan""]";['Coronavirus', 'Hospitals', 'Omicron variant', 'Greater Manchester'];"Hospitals in Greater Manchester have paused non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments due to the rising impact of Covid on patients and staff. A statement by Greater Manchester Combined Authority said the temporary measure, affecting 17 hospitals from Tuesday, will not apply to cancer and urgent care, including cardiac surgery, vascular surgery and transplantation.
About 15% of staff across the region are off sick or isolating with Covid, while in some hospitals more than one in five patients have the virus. Diagnostic services, including endoscopy, and the majority of outpatient services will continue “wherever possible”. The statement reads: “Staff have worked tirelessly to try to maintain services and deliver the highest quality of healthcare to local people. “But Covid admissions are rising sharply (from 126 on 19 December to 359 on 2 January), as are inpatient diagnoses (193 to 738 for the same period), and in some hospitals more than one in five patients have Covid (though this is not translating into critical care pressure at present). “However, the main reason is the high and rising level of staff absence, with around 15% off, either ill with Covid or isolating. “There are also outbreaks in an increasing number of care homes, which is affecting how people are discharged from hospital. “The bed modelling suggests these challenges may get worse, not better, in the next week or two.” The hospitals affected include Royal Bolton hospital, Trafford general hospital, Wythenshawe hospital and Macclesfield district general hospital. Patients who are not contacted should assume their treatment is continuing as planned, the statement added. Fiona Noden, chief executive of Bolton NHS foundation trust, co-chair of Greater Manchester hospital gold command and lead for elective care in the region, said: “This has been a very difficult decision and not one that we have taken lightly, but we’ve done it so we can keep people safe, can maintain the very best infection control measures, can make sure we deploy staff to where they’re needed most and can keep looking after people who need urgent and emergency care, including cancer treatment.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/non-urgent-surgery-and-appointments-paused-across-greater-manchester;1
299;299;5544;5544;Capitol attack panel seeks cooperation from Fox News host Sean Hannity;2022-01-04T22:41:30Z;['Maanvi Singh'];['US Capitol attack', 'Sean Hannity', 'US politics', 'US news', 'World news', 'Donald Trump'];"The US House of Representatives panel investigating the deadly attack on the US Capitol last January is seeking cooperation from Sean Hannity, the Fox News host and one of Donald Trump’s closest allies in the media, as the committee continues to widen its scope. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chair of the committee, and vice-chair Liz Cheney have requested that Hannity answer questions in relation to communications between Hannity and the former president, as well as the former president’s chief of staff Mark Meadows, and others in the days leading up to the attack, the day itself and in the aftermath. In a letter to Hannity, made public on Tuesday, Thompson and Cheney wrote: “The Select Committee now has information in its possession, as outlined in part below, indicating that you had advance knowledge regarding President Trump’s and his legal team’s planning for January 6th.
“It also appears that you were expressing concerns and providing advice to the President and certain White House staff regarding that planning. You also had relevant communications while the riot was underway, and in the days thereafter. These communications make you a fact witness in our investigation.” The House select committee investigating the 6 January insurrection revealed last month that Hannity and other Fox News hosts had messaged Meadows during the attack. Hannity has been a major supporter of Trump on his Fox show, as well as an adviser to the former president. “Can he make a statement? Ask people to leave the Capitol?” Hannity texted Meadows during the attack, the recently released records show. The anchor has avoided publicly blaming Trump for riling up the crowd that then attacked the Capitol. In his letter, Thompson said that the committee has “immense respect for the First Amendment to our Constitution, freedom of the press, and the rights of Americans to express their political opinions freely”, and did not intend to seek information regarding Hannity’s broadcasts. However, the chairman said, the committee also has a responsibility to investigate the dozens of text messages it has in its possession, dating from 31 December 2020 to 20 January 2021, between Hannity, Trump and Meadows regarding the outcome of the 2020 presidential election and Trump’s failed efforts to contest it. One specific December 2020 text from Hannity to Meadows highlighted in the letter reads: “I do NOT see January 6 happening the way he is being told. After the 6 th. (sic) He should announce will lead the nationwide effort to reform voting integrity. Go to Fl and watch Joe mess up daily. Stay engaged. When he speaks people will listen.” The letter to Hannity also highlights texts from the night before the insurrection, including one in which Hannity said he was “very worried about the next 48 hours” and another to Meadows in which he wrote, “Pence pressure. WH counsel will leave.” The letter says it appears from other text messages that Hannity may have spoken directly with Trump on 5 January regarding planning for the following day.
Hannity had previously criticized the violence that took place nearly a year ago at the Capitol. But he has also been sharply critical of the committee and its work, saying after his texts were revealed: “We’ve been telling you that this is a waste of your time and money. They have a predetermined outcome.” A Fox News spokesperson declined to comment on the request. Jay Sekulow, Hannity’s lawyer, told the Associated Press on Tuesday night that they were reviewing the committee’s letter and “will respond as appropriate”. The request is the first by the nine-member panel to a member of the media and opens a new door for the investigation as it widens its scope to any and all people who were in contact with the former president and his inner circle in the time surrounding the attack. The committee says the extraordinary trove of material it has collected – 35,000 pages of records so far, including texts, emails and phone records from people close to Trump – is fleshing out critical details of the worst attack on the Capitol in two centuries, which played out on live television. As the House prepares to commemorate the anniversary of the attack on Thursday, the panel, which commenced its work last summer, has already interviewed nearly 300 people and issued subpoenas to more than 40 as it seeks to create a comprehensive record of the attack and the events leading up to it. Thompson said about 90% of the witnesses called by the committee have cooperated despite the defiance of high-profile Trump allies such as Meadows and Steve Bannon. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will mark the anniversary this Thursday with speeches, alongside a slate of commemorative events. On Monday, meanwhile, Trump announced he was cancelling his own press conference on the day, blaming the House committee. “In light of the total bias and dishonesty of the January 6th Unselect Committee of Democrats, two failed Republicans, and the Fake News Media, I am canceling the January 6th Press Conference at Mar-a-Lago,” Trump said.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/capitol-attack-committee-sean-hannity-fox-news;1
300;300;5545;5545;Conte gives Levy a nudge as Lukaku storm stirs up Kane question at Spurs | David Hytner;2022-01-04T22:30:24Z;['David Hytner'];['Tottenham Hotspur', 'Antonio Conte', 'Harry Kane', 'Romelu Lukaku', 'Chelsea', 'Carabao Cup', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Star centre-forward sparks unrest with unauthorised interview over frustration. It is the banner headline that stalks Chelsea into their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Tottenham at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night. But it is also the one that has cast long shadows at Spurs since May. For Romelu Lukaku’s comments to Sky Italia, broadcast last Thursday, see those of Harry Kane to Gary Neville on The Overlap podcast; the ones in which he said he was approaching a crossroads and made clear he wanted a new challenge away from Spurs.
For Antonio Conte, the Spurs manager – previously of Chelsea, where he won one Premier League and one FA Cup in two seasons coloured by increasing levels of friction – diplomacy has been the watchword. Conte loves Lukaku, with whom he worked productively at Internazionale – the pair won Serie A last season – and he was never going to give his thoughts on the player saying he was unhappy at Chelsea and questioning the system of the manager, Thomas Tuchel. Conte’s take on Kane is more balanced, saying that the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, made a “great choice” to hold him to his contract in the face of interest from Manchester City. “In this way, you are showing you want to continue to build something important around one of the best players in your team,” Conte said. But he also expressed his understanding of Kane’s situation, a measure of solidarity. Like Kane, Conte came through the ranks at his hometown club, playing for Lecce for six and a bit seasons. He then moved to Juventus at 22 and stayed for the remainder of his playing days, winning 14 trophies across 13 seasons, including five league titles and one Champions League. Kane has yet to win any team honours during his one-club career.
“I understand Harry’s situation,” Conte said. “When you finish your career, you can see your appearances and the teams you made them for but, at the same time, it’s right to see what you have won. This is important, especially for the top, top players. Sometimes it happens that important players finish with a couple of titles and other players who are medium or medium-low finish with many titles.” Conte’s trophy haul as a manager stands at nine, including four Serie A titles – the first three with Juventus – and he makes no bones about why Levy signed him. If Chelsea had the star manager in Tuchel and then added the big‑name striker in Lukaku, it was the other way round at Spurs but the ends are the same. “For Tottenham to bring me here, I think that he [Levy] wanted to send a signal outside and maybe also to our players,” Conte said. “Now we see what happens. Because to take the coach that is used to win, then you have to do.” A little message, perhaps, as to the need for Levy to back him in the transfer market? What Conte knows is that he requires time because Spurs are not at the level they were under Mauricio Pochettino, who had established them in the top four. “For sure, there is an important gap with other teams,” Conte said. “I see many, many teams that are more ready now to win titles. We have to build a situation where we can be competitive and try to win.” Conte was more than just an interested onlooker for the summer saga involving Kane, having been approached to take charge at Tottenham in early June. There is no way Conte would have said yes if he had suspected Kane were leaving, although it should be stressed that Levy never had any intention of allowing the player to go. Conte’s proposed switch back then broke down quickly and for other reasons and Kane would eventually announce on 25 August that he was staying. It has been a tough season in general for him but there have been more encouraging signs since Conte completed his move to Spurs at the second attempt, replacing Nuno Espírito Santo at the start of November.
“In the summer I followed the situation about Harry and I saw what happened and what could happen,” Conte said. “But we have to live in the present and that says Harry is a player at Tottenham. First of all we are talking about a really good person, a really good man. I am totally satisfied with his commitment and the relationship that we have created within the team. I have found a player that is totally involved in this project now.” Conte’s Stamford Bridge return will stir good and bad memories. His title win in 2016-17 was little short of extraordinary, given the club had finished 10th the previous time out, but fifth in his second season – and the failure to secure Champions League football – was a blot. Then there were the draining disagreements with the hierarchy over transfer policy, the strained relations with a number of players in the second season and the protracted legal battle over his payoff, which he would win. “We won the league with a team that I think wasn’t the best in the league,” Conte said. “We reached the final in the FA Cup and then won it in the second season. We did a fantastic job but sometimes it’s not enough. When it happens that the club sends you away, you can be disappointed and frustrated but you have to show great respect for the decision.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/conte-gives-levy-a-nudge-as-lukaku-storm-stirs-up-kane-question-at-spurs;2
301;301;5546;5546;Tuchel fines Lukaku over Chelsea ‘mess’ despite striker’s apology for interview;2022-01-04T22:30:07Z;['Jacob Steinberg'];['Chelsea', 'Thomas Tuchel', 'Romelu Lukaku', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Thomas Tuchel will fine Romelu Lukaku despite accepting the striker’s apology for a controversial interview and has said he faced no opposition from Chelsea’s board after dropping the club’s record signing against Liverpool. Player power has been a problem for many of Tuchel’s predecessors but the manager has been boosted by support from above since Lukaku publicised his unhappiness about life at Stamford Bridge. Tuchel was in a strong position when he held talks with the £97.5m forward on Monday and looked for signs of remorse before recalling him for Wednesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Tottenham.
Exuding calm and authority before hosting Antonio Conte’s Spurs, Tuchel said Lukaku was determined to “clean up the mess” caused by his comments to Sky Italia. However, Lukaku could get a frosty reception from Chelsea’s supporters and Tuchel revealed the former Internazionale forward, who earns about £350,000 a week, would face further punishment. “There will be some discipline action and he will accept it,” Tuchel said. “It’s not a small thing, it’s not the biggest thing and it doesn’t make a comeback impossible – absolutely not. This is what we prove now. But something happened and he will be fined and he needs to accept it.” Tuchel said he was pleased to have the backing of Chelsea’s hierarchy. Marina Granovskaia, the powerful director, was involved in Monday’s talks and Tuchel, who also consulted his senior players before omitting Lukaku against Liverpool, enjoys a good relationship with Petr Cech, Chelsea’s technical and performance adviser. “It is not like I push my opinions or the club pushes its opinions,” Tuchel said. “We are adults and we reflect on the situation. The more the story went on I had a clear opinion and I was more than happy that it was OK for the club to go with it. It was nice to see that we have a very close relationship and can find very quick solutions without any political interference. The way we dealt with it, Petr and Marina and me, was very calm.” Lukaku, who has scored seven goals in 18 appearances since rejoining Chelsea last summer, found himself in trouble after questioning Tuchel’s system and expressing a wish to return to Inter one day. The interview, aired last Thursday but conducted three weeks previously, went down badly at Chelsea and raised huge doubts over the player’s future. However, Lukaku does not want a transfer and reaffirmed his commitment to the club in a public apology on the club’s website last night. The striker said he understood why supporters are so upset with him. “I totally understand,” Lukaku told Chelsea TV. “I think I should have been clearer in my message. The interview was about saying goodbye to the Inter fans, it was not about trying to disrespect the fans, the football club, the owner, my teammates and the manager. “They did a lot of effort to bring me back here. I wanted to come back. I was on a mission since I left. I totally understand the frustrations of the fans. Now it’s on me to show my commitment at 100%. They don’t need to question it. “I always said I wanted to come here to be successful. Chelsea is a club that is equal to success. All players come here to win and I have a special passion for this club. I want to win here for many years. To the fans I’m sorry for the upset I’ve caused. You guys know the connection I have with this club since my teenage years. Also to the manager I apologise, and to my teammates and the board. I want to move on forward from this.”
Tuchel accepts the player did not mean to cause offence. “He did not do this intentionally to create noise in front of such a big game,” the manager added. “It is small enough to stay calm, accept an apology and move on. He feels the responsibility to clean the mess up. Maybe we will have a bit of smell still from it. He can handle it but he also has no other choice.” Tuchel denied Lukaku, who fired Inter to the Serie A title last season, had not been his top target. He had also looked at Tottenham’s Harry Kane. “First choice is about what’s possible and what’s not possible, and what is a good fit,” Tuchel said. “It was the perfect fit and still is. I don’t think you can assume that we spent this amount of money while having major doubts.” The intrigue before the Spurs match is that Lukaku played the best football of his career for Conte’s Inter. The former Chelsea manager paired the Belgian with Lautaro Martínez in a 3-5-2, whereas Tuchel has mostly played a 3-4-2-1 this season.
“We cannot just play like Inter played and hope that will bring the best out of Romelu,” Tuchel said. “Antonio Conte is a fantastic coach. That system he played at Inter did not only suit Romelu and Martínez, it fits the whole squad. Conte played 3-4-3 at Chelsea. At Inter he played 3-5-2. Obviously he is adapting to his players and implementing his ideas and this is what I do.” Tuchel was asked whether Lukaku should talk about his frustrations in private next time. “Do I have to tell a 28-year-old it would be better to come to me?” he said. “That would assume that he has a problem. Even if I read the interview 100 times I don’t see the problem. I can understand that people are offended. I was not so much. I don’t see such a big change in our relationship.”
Tuchel said Thiago Silva was showing no signs of slowing down after the 37-year-old defender signed a one-year contract extension. “Benjamin Button,” he said. “Thiago Button of football. A new contract makes him calm. Thiago needs to be calm because he’s a very sensitive and emotional person, which makes him also so precious for our dressing room. He can feel emotions.” Real Madrid still want to sign Antonio Rüdiger on a free despite reports they have cooled their interest. Bayern Munich, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain are also interested in the defender but Tuchel wants him to stay. “He has not signed the contract we have offered, but we are in communications with him,” Tuchel said. Trevoh Chalobah will be missing against Tottenham after injuring a hamstring and Andreas Christensen is doubtful with a back injury but Timo Werner could be on the bench after recovering from Covid-19. Reece James and Ben Chilwell are long-term absentees.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/chelsea-lukaku-sorry-clean-mess-up-tuchel;2
302;302;5547;5547;Kieran Trippier to join Newcastle after initial £12m fee agreed with Atlético;2022-01-04T22:29:48Z;['Fabrizio Romano', 'Niall McVeigh'];['Newcastle United', 'Transfer window', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Arsenal', 'Roma'];"Kieran Trippier is set to join Newcastle United after a fee, reportedly an initial £12m with add-ons, was agreed with Atlético Madrid. The England right-back has also agreed personal terms after further discussions between the club and the player’s representatives. The Premier League club are now organising Trippier’s medical before he is officially unveiled as a Newcastle player. Trippier will become Newcastle’s first signing since the club were taken over by a Saudi-backed consortium in October. Negotiations for the 31-year-old have been taking place since December, with Atlético agreeing to sell when it became clear that Trippier wanted to leave and return to England.
The former Tottenham full-back played under the Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, at Burnley and also played for Barnsley after developing as a youth player at Manchester City. Trippier made 67 appearances in two and a half years at Atlético and won the Spanish title with the club last season, earning a place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad for Euro 2020. Newcastle are hoping to add at least three more January signings in a bid to avoid relegation this season, with the Burnley centre-back James Tarkowski a target. Howe is also keen to add a central midfielder and a forward, with Callum Wilson facing a long spell out with a torn calf muscle. In other news, Ainsley Maitland-Niles is on the verge of joining José Mourinho’s Roma on loan until the end of the season, with no purchase option agreed. Arsenal will receive €1m (£830,000) in loan fees – €500,000 up front with another €500,000 in bonuses – with Roma also paying the midfielder’s wages during his loan spell. Maitland-Niles asked to leave Arsenal on social media at the end of the summer transfer window but stayed at the Emirates, making only two Premier League starts so far this season. Mikel Arteta is also prepared to allow Folarin Balogun to leave on loan in January, with Championship side Middlesbrough front runners to sign the 20-year-old striker.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/transfer-news-kieran-tripper-newcastle-ainsley-maitland-niles-roma;4
303;303;5548;5548;Five great reads: animal attacks, the art of recovery, overlooked actors and an easy way to drink less;2022-01-04T22:26:58Z;['Alyx Gorman'];['Animals', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Film', 'Culture'];"Hello, happy brunch-time and a big welcome back to everyone except La Niña, who I resent even when she’s watering my garden. This is Five Great Reads, a weekday summertime wrap of interest, service and sweet, sweet juice picked out by me, Alyx Gorman, lifestyle editor of Guardian Australia. You may notice today’s reads are arriving a little later in the morning. That’s because my esteemed colleagues over at the Morning Mail are back on tools and summarising the news first thing, just for you. And if you’d like to read through the day’s events as they unfold, you can do so at our live blog. Finally, a paragraph later than expected, comes a reminder that if you’re reading this as an article, you can also receive it as an email by putting your address in the box below.
To the people who are already receiving this as an email, I am sorry I keep saying this, and even more sorry you can’t see the box. It’s a very nice box. Now we’re done with the box chat, onto the reads. 1. How does it feel to fight off a predator in the wild? Five people who survived terrifying wild animal attacks share their stories and the way these incidents shaped their lives. Which terrifying animals? A mountain lion, a shark, a bear, a hippo and an otter. An otter? An otter.
Otters aren’t terrifying. “The otter kept torpedoing underwater to bite my legs,” says Leah Hiller. “It would come up, track where I was, and attack again. I knew I couldn’t outswim it, so I just had to brace for the bites and try to protect my neck because, if it hit me there, I would have drowned.” “These sharp, searing bites were coming from every angle,” she continues. “It bit me 25 times. Some of them were two inches deep and one pierced my ankle bone.” How long will it take me to read? Like many of the animals mentioned, this is a big one. It’ll take about nine minutes to read. But if you can’t be tempted into reading 4,000 words of personal experience on animal attacks (with a gently eco bent) then honestly, you just can’t be pleased. Bonus read: Okay, one last attempt to please you with a very good boy instead: a dog that saved a hiker’s life in the Croatian mountains. 2. The slow, overlooked art of recovery As millions around the world grapple with long-Covid, “we need to respect the process of healing” writes GP Gavin Francis.
Notable quote: “Convalescence is anything but a passive process,” Francis writes. This realisation came to him while he worked on a brain injury rehabilitation ward as a junior doctor. “Though its rhythms and its tempo are often slow and gentle, it’s an act, and actions need us to be present, to engage, to give of ourselves.” How long will it take me to read? Eight minutes. But it’s a must for anyone who has ever fallen and taken a while to get up. 3. The year in underrated actors Film critic Guy Loge on the best performances this award season has overlooked.
What’s in it for me? You’ll end up with a long list of movies to watch, from Norwegian dramadies to spiky road trip flicks to a horror movie so scary-sounding I can’t watch the trailer. How many movies? 16 4. Is civil war fomenting in the US? Stephen Marche certainly seems to think so. In an extract from his new book the Next Civil War, he makes his case. Notable quote: “The right has recognised what the left has not: that the system is in collapse,” Marche writes. “The right has a plan: it involves violence and solidarity. They have not abjured even the Oath Keepers. The left, meanwhile, has chosen infighting as their sport.” How long will it take to read? About four minutes. Bonus read: After finishing Marche’s piece, you might just forgive the Americans for trying to be rid of the phrase “no worries”. They do seem to have worries. 5. An easy win: drink a little less Finally, here’s Celina Ribeiro on how a couple of dry nights a week have helped change her relationship with alcohol.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/five-great-reads-animal-attacks-the-art-of-recovery-overlooked-actors-and-an-easy-way-to-drink-less;5
304;304;5549;5549;PEN15 review – the most captivating cringe-comedy on TV bows out on a high;2022-01-04T22:15:24Z;['Rebecca Nicholson'];['Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'TV comedy', 'Comedy'];PEN15 (Sky Comedy) started out as a show that leaned on the grotesqueness of the teenage experience, and was constructed on the foundations of a largely visual joke – that the 13-year-old versions of the two protagonists, Maya and Anna, were played by actors in their 30s, while the other 13-year-olds around them were played by actors of that age. Yet its early fondness for a gross-out gag has evolved and it has matured into a remarkably sensitive and beautiful series about life, friendship and growing up. This run of final episodes, which conclude a second season delayed by the pandemic, mark the end of the show. It is bowing out at the peak of its powers. It returns with Bat Mitzvah, in which Becca, one of the Mean Girls-esque characters who is far more popular than Maya or Anna, has her batmitzvah, having been reminded to chase her classmates’ RSVPs during a lesson about the Holocaust. Becca’s disdain for Maya, a running theme of the series, turns a party into a finely tuned study of peer pressure and economic status, as Maya starts to realise that her family cannot buy Swarovski jewellery with the same ease as some of her classmates. When Maya hands Becca the gift she has forced her father to buy, it is a terrible, awkward snapshot of teen power dynamics and porcelain-thin self-esteem. Often awkward and usually excruciating, PEN15 conjures all the most painful parts of growing up and forces its characters to act them out, slowly, as if tiptoeing over a cliff edge. While Maya is learning about her social class, Anna is having an existential crisis, brought on by the discovery that there is evil in the world. Her parents’ divorce is exacerbating her anxiety, and the pressure of the newfound suspicion that life is pointless leads to alcohol, a kiss and a potential new boyfriend. All the great levelling drama of being a teen is here, from trying to be popular to wondering how God could allow great suffering to happen. It all exists in the same heightened emotional state. By this stage of PEN15, it is largely easy to forget that Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle, who created the show as well as starring in it, are not 13, which is a credit to its keen eye for detail. It takes place in an American middle school, but you don’t need to be familiar with American schools to relate. It is set in 2000, but its retro appeal is also confined to the background now, and mostly to quick jokes about Discmans, waiting for a phone call that might never come, or endless conversations on the landline. (You know, the thing you couldn’t use when the dial-up was on.) Instead, it has blossomed into an intelligent and creative comedy. It has style and flair, tipping into the surreal when it feels appropriate, never afraid to be inventive. One episode unfolds from the perspective of Maya’s mother, Yuki (played by Erkine’s real mother). There is a scene involving amphetamines at a funeral, a clever use of glow sticks and light to convey a panic attack, and, in one especially tense moment, a use of perspective that is wordlessly devastating. If some of its early, cruder humour has been lost, that seems like a fair exchange. What remains is still funny and sometimes hilarious, though it is all tempered with fragility, and the sense that the characters are not quite grown-up enough to deal with what the world is throwing at them, until they do deal with it, usually together. This is sweet without being sickly, and that is a rare and hard-won balancing act. Its tone is perfectly judged. The show is so pitifully accurate about how cringeworthy teenage life can be that, at times, it is tough to watch. I put my hands over my eyes more frequently while viewing this than I would during a horror film. Towards its end, with the arrival of a sinister stoner named Derek, the series takes on a darker hue. Death intrudes on Anna’s life, and sex begins to nudge its way into Anna and Maya’s immediate world. I found the very last episode surprisingly upsetting, and wondered if this was really how it would end. And then it pulled out its PEN15 superpower, turned its lights up, and became something touching and brilliant again.;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/04/pen15-review-the-most-captivating-cringe-comedy-on-tv-bows-out-on-a-high;5
305;305;5550;5550;‘Gorgeous girls Afterpay their rapid antigen test’: TikTokers say it is cathartic to make light of Omicron;2022-01-04T21:55:35Z;['Lisa Favazzo'];['Health', 'Coronavirus', 'TikTok', 'Australia news'];"So many young people in Australia are testing positive to Covid that videos about their experiences are going viral on TikTok. One popular trend involves users posting videos of their positive rapid antigen test, or some other situation showing they have Covid, with the voiceover: “Yep that’s me, you’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.” That is then cut with a video of them doing legal but high-risk activities – such as dancing at a music festival – to the sound of Boney M’s Rasputin.
Other videos show users struggling to get their hand on a rapid antigen test or waiting in long queues at Covid testing centres. “Gorgeous gorgeous girls Afterpay their rapid antigen test,” writes TikTok user @eilishgilligan, in a statement that attempts to capture the mood of young people living in Australia’s major cities.
According to New South Wales department of health statistics, 38,407 people between the ages of 20 and 29 tested positive for Covid-19 in the past seven days – 28% of the total cases. In Victoria, there were 18,467 active cases in the same cohort – 38% of the total. Victoria’s Covid logistics chief, Jeroen Weimar, admitted on Tuesday the state’s actual figures were likely higher but he said about 30-40% of cases being picked up were in people aged 20 to 40. As rapid antigen tests become increasingly hard to come by and PCR testing queues report hours-long waiting times, the Monash University infectious disease modeller Dr Michael Lydeamore said it was unlikely government statistics were capturing the magnitude of the outbreak. “We are just not getting an accurate picture of what’s happening,” he said.
Lydeamore said part of the problem was that there was no way to capture the results of rapid antigen tests. “In the UK, for example, there is a barcode on every test, and a QR code,” he said. “You can scan that with your phone and put in your information and record your test result and then the health agency can access that for reporting. “We don’t have that system here and so there are all these people testing positive with RATs, doing the right thing and staying home, but we have no way to know about them.” Although countless TikTok users claim they picked up the virus while celebrating New Year’s Eve, Lydeamore said several factors contributed to the high positive rates among people in their 20s. That cohort were traditionally key transmitters during outbreaks of infectious disease, he said. Not only because of their social contacts but because they also tended to work in high-risk settings such as retail, hospitality and busy offices.

Lydeamore said the timeline of the vaccine rollout also contributed to the high case numbers. “A lot of people in that age category are pretty far from their primary dose and not yet eligible for a booster. And that’s going to put them more at risk potentially of acquiring the virus.” ‘You have to laugh or you’ll cry’ Some young people on social media have said – most likely in jest – they were lucky to have tested positive before the recent outbreak so they could move on with their lives. “Smashing out c0v1d early so I can have an uninterrupted hot v@x summer,” says one user, 28-year-old Georgia Milhe (@brokebutmakeitboujee), who tested positive for Covid in November.
She said joking about the situation was a cathartic release and, despite her comment, she remained concerned she would be impacted by the current Omicron outbreak. She was doing her best to avoid exposure, reporting a similar attitude among her circle of friends. “You have to laugh or you’ll cry,” Milhe said. “I don’t think people are taking it lightly, I just think they’re trying to cope. This situation – to think that it’s going to still be going on and getting worse than it was after all the lockdowns – it’s pretty crap.” ‘You just have to try and protect yourself’ Other users have joked about trying to get the virus now so they can isolate with their housemates and partners. But Lydeamore warned against this strategy. “Even though younger people have a much lower chance of getting a severe disease, it’s certainly not zero,” he said. “There’s plenty of people under 30 in hospital and in intensive care. And every time you get Covid, that is something that could happen to you.” He also pointed to reports from South Africa of people suffering “distinct infections as little as a month apart”.
While he acknowledged the challenges of young people – especially those who live in shared housing – he said it was important everyone tried to avoid exposure. “It’s not inevitable that everyone will get Covid,” he said. “It’s inevitable that a lot of people will get Covid, but we don’t know who those people are. You just have to try and protect yourself as best as you can, the closer quarters [make it] harder, but you just have to do your best.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/gorgeous-girls-afterpay-their-rapid-antigen-test-tiktokers-say-it-is-cathartic-to-make-light-of-omicron;7
306;306;5552;5552;Suspect in killing of Haiti president arrested by US authorities;2022-01-04T20:26:05Z;['Peter Beaumont'];['Haiti', 'Americas', 'World news', 'Panama', 'Jamaica', 'Colombia'];A suspected member of the group involved in the assassination of Haiti’s president, Jovenel Moïse, has been arrested by US authorities after he was detained while transiting through Panama following his deportation from Jamaica to Colombia. Mario Antonio Palacios, 43, a former member of the Colombian military, is accused by Haitian authorities of being part of a mercenary group that tortured and killed Moïse and wounded his wife, Martine, during an attack on Moïse’s private home in July. Palacios has admitted in a media interview being in Moïse’s bedroom during the assault in which the president died, but has denied being involved in the killing. He entered Jamaica illegally and was detained in prison after his arrest in October while the courts considered an application from Haiti for his extradition. Jamaica instead ordered his deportation to Colombia, but while transiting to his home country via Panama he was intercepted at the airport and put on a flight to the US, which, like Haiti, has issued an Interpol red notice requesting his arrest. Palacios appeared at a federal court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon but did not enter a plea. He is scheduled to appear in court again on 31 January. Panama authorities have issued no public comment on the affair but a person familiar with the matter in Panama confirmed that Palacios had been detained. A video shared with Reuters by the source, who declined to be identified, showed two immigration agents escorting a man, whose face was not shown, through what appeared to be Panama’s airport. An official source quoted by the Colombian news site El Tiempo said: “It seems very certain that Palacios will be sent to the United States because the [legal] process there was pushed forward urgently and they have a plane ready for him.” Palacios’s detention in Panama and arrest by US authorities marks the latest twist in the saga of the investigation into Moise’s assassination, which remains largely mired in mystery. Jamaican authorities ruled that Haiti’s request for Palacios’s extradition did not meet its legal requirements. “This request, as a matter of law, could not proceed, could not be processed and was destined to fail,” said Paula Llewellyn, Jamaica’s director of public prosecutions (DPP), on Friday. According to reports, Palacios had not been named as a suspect in the murder but was instead being sought on a charge of armed robbery. It appeared at the weekend that the Colombian would be allowed to travel home after he was photographed shaking hands with the Colombian ambassador to Jamaica, Jairo Clopatofsky Ghisays. Palacios is believed to be the last of the alleged group of mercenaries to be detained. In an interview given while he was still in hiding, he insisted he had no knowledge of who killed Moïse. “I don’t know who killed him. I say it from the heart for my family, for my children,” he told the Week, though he did admit he had entered Moïse’s house. According to a report prepared by the Haitian police and leaked to various media outlets, Palacios – also known by his nickname of “Floro” – is accused of being one of the instigators of Moïse’s assassination on 7 July. He is accused of being one of 26 Colombians and two Haitian Americans who made up a hit squad that stormed the president’s private residence in the middle of the night claiming to be part of a US Drug Enforcement Administration operation. Moïse was shot a dozen times and also appeared to have had an eye gouged out during the assault. None of the surviving Colombians captured in Haiti have yet been put on trial, and the motivation behind the assassination remains unclear amid contradictory claims. On Saturday, gunmen tried to kill Haiti’s prime minister, Ariel Henry, during an event to mark the anniversary of the country’s independence, officials say. The incident happened at a church in the northern city of Gonaïves. Video posted online showed the prime minister and his entourage scrambling toward their cars amid intense gunfire.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/suspect-linked-to-killing-of-haitis-president-is-detained-in-panama;6
307;307;5553;5553;Parts of NHS may be overwhelmed by Covid wave, admits Boris Johnson;2022-01-04T20:15:20Z;['Rowena Mason', 'Denis Campbell'];['Coronavirus', 'NHS', 'UK news', 'Boris Johnson', 'Infectious diseases', 'Science'];"Parts of the NHS may be overwhelmed in the coming weeks, Boris Johnson has admitted for the first time as he insisted England can “ride out” its biggest ever Covid wave “without shutting down our country once again”. The prime minister acknowledged the health service is under huge pressure after four more NHS trusts – all outside London – declared critical incidents amid rising staff absences and Covid patients. On Tuesday evening hospitals across Greater Manchester announced some non-urgent surgery and appointments would be suspended. Heart attack patients calling 999 in parts of northern England were also asked to get a lift instead of waiting for an ambulance as hospitals in the region experienced more than double the growth rate in numbers of Covid patients compared with London, which was previously worst hit by the Omicron variant surge.
With frontline worker absences fuelled by a record 218,000 new confirmed UK cases of Covid on Tuesday, Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical adviser, said the NHS faced “very substantial pressure over the next couple of weeks” – though there was not yet a “surge in mortality” seen with other waves by this stage. Johnson claimed the vaccine programme and reduced chance of hospitalisation with Omicron meant there was now a chance for the country to get through the wave without imposing new restrictions. To reduce disruption from staff off sick or isolating with Covid, he unveiled a plan for 100,000 critical workers to get tests on every working day to detect cases quickly and prevent them spreading, although some experts raised concerns that was not enough. It was reported last night that health officials were also looking at relaxing rules around PCR tests. People who have asymptomatic infections will no longer need to take a follow-up test after a positive lateral flow test, the Daily Telegraph reported. Previously, Johnson has said he would bring in further restrictions if there was a risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed. However, the prime minister accepted it may already be happening in some areas when asked for a definition of this, given many medical staff feel that situation has already been reached. “The NHS is under huge pressure,” he told a Downing Street press conference. “I won’t provide a definition of what being overwhelmed would constitute because I think that different trusts and different places, at different moments, will feel at least temporarily overwhelmed. Johnson said the country had a chance to “ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again”. He said hospitals were “at the moment … sending out signals saying that they are feeling the pressure hugely and there will be a difficult period for our wonderful NHS for the next few weeks because of Omicron … I just think we have to get through it as best as we possibly can.” In a further sign of the intense strain on hospitals, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority said that the region’s 17 hospitals “have made the difficult decision to pause some non-urgent surgery and appointments due to the rising impact of Covid”. However, surgery for cancer, heart conditions, vascular problems and organ transplantation will still go ahead, it pledged. Medics and scientists have been pressing Johnson for weeks to bring in restrictions beyond the advice for people to work from home and requirement for masks in shops and on public transport, with tougher measures already in force in Scotland and Wales. But the prime minister would find it very difficult to get support for further measures in England from Tory backbenchers, scores of whom voted against current plan B restrictions before Christmas.
Johnson did not rule out further measures to tackle Covid transmission but said the current plan was to “keep our schools and our businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus”. Health leaders reacted with concern, saying Johnson had not acknowledged the depths of the NHS’s problems despite unprecedented pressure in some areas. Pat Cullen, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said nursing staff will have “watched the prime minister’s statement in disbelief”. “One described to me today that the NHS feels more broken than she’s ever known it. This is not hysteria, this is blowing the whistle on falling standards as patient care comes under real threat,” she said. “Vaccinations alone will not reduce infections and hospitalisations – more must be done to prioritise nursing staff for access to testing and high-quality PPE. Meanwhile, the emphasis on virtual and temporary beds shows that the government still fails to recognise the value of highly skilled nursing staff or grasp the extent of the workforce crisis.” Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the attempt to reassure the public that the NHS is not being overwhelmed “does not chime with the experience of staff up and down the country who are facing fast-rising hospital admissions, intense pressures on all parts of the health and care system and widespread staff absence”. “We urge the government not to allow its optimism to lead to complacency given the rapidly changing situation we are seeing on a daily basis,” added Taylor. He welcomed the plan for daily rapid testing of key workers but said it should have been made available earlier in the pandemic. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, urged Johnson to impose new restrictions to help relieve the pressure. “The facts, figures and the living reality for thousands of patients and NHS staff daily demonstrate undoubtedly that the NHS is currently already overwhelmed,” said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s chair of council. “Asking the NHS to ‘just get through it’, without doing anything to help, would be to wrongly accept avoidable suffering to thousands of patients in the coming weeks.” Johnson was flanked by Whitty and Prof Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, as he outlined the approach for England. Vallance said there were “extraordinarily high levels of infection at the moment” in the UK. Hospital pressures would depend on how Omicron had an effect on the older generation, he said. Whitty acknowledged that “some hospitals, some areas of the country” will come under “very substantial pressure over the next couple of weeks” with high numbers of staff isolating over infections compounding the typical winter pressures. He also spoke of being left “saddened” by the proportion of unvaccinated patients in intensive care, as he urged people to get their boosters.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/parts-of-nhs-may-be-overwhelmed-by-covid-wave-admits-boris-johnson;3
308;308;5554;5554;Canada agrees C$40bn deal to reform child welfare for First Nations;2022-01-04T20:04:11Z;['Tracey Lindeman'];['Canada', 'Indigenous peoples', 'Americas', 'Global development', 'World news'];"A C$40bn agreement-in-principle has been reached in Canada to reform the child welfare system for First Nations people and compensate more than 200,000 individuals and families who suffered because of it. At the heart of the deal is a legacy of discrimination in child welfare systems that saw many children removed from their homes and placed in state care, and others who were denied adequate medical care and social services because of their Indigenous identity.
Half of the C$40bn (US$31bn) is earmarked for reforming a child welfare system deemed discriminatory by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) and federal court. The other half is reserved for payments to First Nations people harmed by the on-reserve and Yukon child welfare systems between 1 April 1991 and 31 March 2022. First Nations people who experienced delays or denials of medical care and social services between 1991 and 2017 will also receive compensation. “For too long, the Government of Canada did not adequately fund or support the wellness of First Nations families and children,” said Patty Hajdu, minister of Indigenous services, as details of the deal were released on Tuesday. “No compensation amount can make up for the trauma people have experienced, but these agreements-in-principle acknowledge to survivors and their families the harm and pain caused by the discrimination in funding and services,” the minister continued. Cindy Woodhouse of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), who participated in the negotiations, told reporters that federal policies had led to the overrepresentation of First Nations in every province’s and territory’s child welfare system. “This wasn’t and isn’t about parenting. This is about poverty and First Nations children being removed from their families and communities instead of provided help with food, clothing or shelter,” Woodhouse said, adding that child welfare agencies wouldn’t receive funding unless a child was removed. Another of the First Nations organizations involved in the negotiations warned against premature celebration. Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, underlined that this was merely a non-binding agreement. “I see it as words on paper,” she said on Tuesday. “Nothing changes in the lives of children today.” First Nations children are more than 17 times more likely to be in foster care than the typical Canadian, and after they turn 18, they are often left without support to find safe housing, employment or education opportunities or even the most basic care services, Blackstock said. She said some of the $20bn earmarked for reform will go toward those needs.
The $40bn settlement was reached in the 11th hour of negotiations, on 31 December – the culmination of years of hard-fought litigation, class-action lawsuits and challenges from the federal government, which began with a human rights complaint in 2007. That complaint alleged that federal authorities intentionally underfunded services for First Nations communities and needlessly removed children from their homes. One of its primary arguments was that Canada was not respecting its duty to uphold Jordan’s Principle, which was passed after the 2005 death of five-year-old Jordan River Anderson of the Norway House Cree Nation in Manitoba. Born with medical problems, Anderson spent most of his life in hospital and ultimately died while the provincial and federal governments squabbled over who should pay for his care. Jordan’s Principle dictates that the first government of contact is required to immediately cover the cost of services, and resolve jurisdictional disputes later. In Canada, healthcare is a provincial responsibility for non-Indigenous individuals, but Indigenous people fall under federal jurisdiction. Nine years later, the CHRT found the government acted intentionally. Tuesday’s settlement reflects this judgment, as well as other litigation. The outcomes of discrimination in child welfare have long been seen as an extension of the residential school system, a program that ran from the 1880s until 1996 that saw First Nations, Métis and Inuit children removed from their homes and placed in residential schools where physical, sexual and psychological abuse was often rampant.
In 2021, the bodies of thousands of children were discovered on the grounds of former residential schools across Canada, as well as in the United States. Blackstock noted that many of the children included in this compensation program were born to parents who attended residential schools or who were separated from their families in the “Sixties Scoop”. “[The federal government] is a repeat offender against First Nations children,” she said. David Sterns, a lawyer representing one of the classes, pointed out that more First Nations children are in foster care than were living in residential schools at their height. He said some individuals will receive more than $40,000 each for their suffering. He urged First Nations people who may have been affected to register for class inclusion at SotosClassActions.com.";https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/04/canada-first-nations-child-welfare-compensation-deal;1
309;309;5555;5555;NHS is in crisis but the roots go much further back than Omicron;2022-01-04T20:02:49Z;['Denis Campbell'];['NHS', 'Coronavirus', 'Health', 'Health policy', 'Politics', 'Public services policy', 'UK news', 'Society'];"Back in October Sajid Javid insisted: “We don’t believe that the pressures currently faced by the NHS are unsustainable.” It was a statement that did not age well. It led to snorts of derision from senior doctors and hospital bosses, some of whom wondered what planet the health secretary was living on. Days later Roland Sinker, the chief executive of Cambridge university hospitals NHS trust, gave a vivid insight into how easily NHS hospitals can get overwhelmed. He told a staff Zoom meeting that the loss of 150 out of 900 beds at the trust’s main hospital – Addenbrooke’s, one of the NHS’s finest – meant that “we could barely function before Covid”. With “150 beds out of 900” unavailable, “this is ceasing to function as a hospital”. Days earlier a patient had died in the back of an ambulance outside the hospital. Its inability to cope with demand was so worrying, Sinker said, that it might have to send patients to London or Birmingham. “I’m much more anxious and scared now” than when he took over in 2015, he admitted, adding: “You’d have to be asleep to not realise the profound nature of the crisis we’re in.” Fast forward two months and a growing number of NHS trusts in England, struggling in the face of an Omicron-driven surge in staff sickness, are now having to declare a “critical incident” – an admission that they cannot cope with the extreme pressure they are facing. “Unfortunately this does mean postponing some non-urgent operations and outpatient appointments to accommodate those patients with the most urgent clinical need,” Aaron Cummins, the chief executive of the university hospitals of Morecambe Bay trust in Cumbria, explained in a statement on Monday. It is easy to see such situations as proof that those places are overwhelmed. On Tuesday it emerged that the NHS ambulance service covering the north-east of England has begun asking friends and relatives of people who have dialled 999 to bring them to hospital themselves, even if they are having a suspected stroke or heart attack, because it cannot guarantee that paramedics will reach them in anywhere near the expected response times. Ministers prefer to trumpet the record funding the NHS is now receiving, and that the largest number of people ever now work in it in England, than hear such stories of the inability of the nation’s most important service to do its job. At Tuesday’s Covid press conference Boris Johnson declined to define what an “overwhelmed” NHS looked like. He denied suggestions that it was already in that state, though did concede that “there will be a difficult period for our wonderful NHS in the next few weeks because of Omicron”. The reality is that today’s pileup of problems shows that much of the NHS is already overwhelmed. As the NHS Providers boss, Chris Hopson, points out, while the service’s current difficulties are the result of “an exceptional Covid surge”, years of government decision-making have left it in this weakened state. “Recent winters and NHS performance pre-Covid show that, after [a] decade of longest/deepest financial squeeze in NHS history, NHS has serious capacity/demand mismatch and broken workforce model,” he said. The NHS in England has had close to 100,000 vacancies for years now, including for about 40,000 nurses and 10,000 doctors. The price of persistent understaffing is paid daily by health personnel routinely working extra hours to ensure patients get good care; that goodwill helps keep the NHS from falling over. Patients experience it in the form of delays in getting help or having a diagnostic test. And it is also felt by a service which, in some parts, too often teeters perilously close to falling over, usually under the extra strain winter brings, but sometimes in summer too, and certainly as a result of Omicron. Analysis by Stephen Rocks of the Health Foundation thinktank shows that the UK has only 3.93 hospital doctors per 100,000 people – the lowest in Europe. It also has just 2.42 beds per 1,000 people, the second lowest in Europe after Sweden, which has only 2.07. And it also ranks low down the international league table for its supply of nurses, CT scanners and MRI scanners. The size of the NHS budget is important. But providing high-quality healthcare involves more than that. It also involves giving the service the staff it needs and taking firm action to reduce illness. Today’s immediate, escalating NHS crisis has long roots, which are also political roots. Years of decisions by David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson, especially their inaction on staffing, left it enfeebled and woefully underprepared for this level of extreme pressure, which the critical incidents and unavailability of ambulances dramatically illustrate. The service’s many supporters can only hope that it does not break altogether in the coming days. • This article was amended on 10 January 2022. The UK has 2.42 hospital beds per 1,000 people, not per 100,000 people.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/04/nhs-is-in-crisis-but-the-roots-go-much-further-back-than-omicron;7
310;310;5556;5556;For the good of football, we should have let the European Super League happen | Paul MacInnes;2022-01-04T20:02:25Z;['Paul MacInnes'];['Football', 'European Super League', 'Sport'];"The changing of a year is a time to reflect, to both remember moments that have passed and imagine how they might have happened differently. These considerations are likely to be personal: should I really have let my hair grow long? What if I had not forced the hire car into the narrow parking space next to the concrete pillar? They can also be grander too and one thought that has returned frequently over the course of the past week is of the latter type. It runs as follows: did we miss a trick by not letting the European Super League happen? By we I mean the source of the amorphous people power credited with bringing the 12-club breakaway competition to a halt. I also mean specifically the English contingent of that protest because the dynamics at work in Spain and Italy are different. Finally I mean the part of that group described as the ‘legacy fan’, those who watch their team in a stadium and who support them in a kind of unconditional fashion, as if we were almost part of it ourselves.
The legacy fan is probably a term most legacy fans would rather not have used about them but it’s here and it means something, so it’s worth using. It’s certainly distinct from the generic ‘fan’, which is used a lot but means a number of different things to different people. The Super League was apparently stopped by the fans. But it was also stopped for the fans because, in the words of the Premier League, it would damage the concept of “an open pyramid, progression through sporting merit and the highest standards of sporting integrity”. Yet most legacy fans will likely be scratching their heads to locate clear examples of each of these phenomena. An open pyramid? The top of the Premier League is choked off by the Super League clubs, the top of the Championship by those who fell out of the top flight and got to spend parachute payments, while the top of League One features several clubs who did all that and still nearly went bust. Most fans outside that group feels boxed in, increasingly frustrated and likely desperate for a billionaire of dubious means to land their helicopter in the club car park. Sporting merit, sure, if you mean spending power in the transfer market. And sporting integrity, well, not only is it an issue pertinent to the debate over a Covid-disrupted schedule but it is inherent in most of the regular sources of debate – from VAR to simulation to tactical fouling to, once again, the disparity in resources available to clubs in the same division.
So let’s say that stopping the breakaway does not mean everything is fine. Could allowing it have made it better? To conduct this thought experiment I must introduce one condition: that when the big six left for the Super League, they left English football altogether. The real plan had it so that there was Super League midweek and Premier League at the weekends (for a bit at least). But in this version, that’s a no. They go. They take their money, their global recruitment networks and their in-house content production teams with them. They pay a one-off exit fee and can concentrate on six-week road trips to China for quadruple headers against Beijing Guoan (oh, yes, one other condition is that the European Super League becomes the Global Super League). Left behind are largely ruins. The Premier League uses the exit money to stave off furious broadcasters, but contemplates a future shorn of global eyeballs. The Championship sees its own exodus, of speculative owners no longer keen on ramming clubs up that open pyramid. Ryan Reynolds cancels his Airbnb in Wrexham. After raging about the betrayal of the big six for a fortnight, radio stations suddenly come to the conclusion that the GSL is, actually, quite an intriguing prospect. Twitter continues to be a squall of egoistic tantrums, but that is what it is there for. Amid the chaos, however, things are suddenly possible that never were before. Sustainability, with limits on owner investment and wage caps at a percentage of clubs’ turnover. With TV interest diminished, public broadcasters can suddenly afford to show games again, but not that many because they have a Stephen Graham drama to squeeze in too. Clubs can no longer afford substantial transfer fees and turn towards developing their own talent. They must also nurture relationships with the one reliable source of income they have: the good old legacy fan.
Not that it would all be manna and ambrosia. Some legacy fans, those of the Super six clubs, who have been ignored and traduced as much as any other, would have to follow their teams to the GSL. Those who remained, the virtuous souls who travel through rain and disrupted railway services to support their team, would also have a dirty secret: they’d enjoy watching the GSL too. Like the Premier League before it, the GSL would offer entertainment comparable to anything on earth. It’s simply that to save the sport, and to maximise the entertainment, the two had to be separated. That separation had once seemed illogical, never mind impossible, but once it had happened it made sense. Now it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle had finished. The legacy fan had won the victory over themselves.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/european-super-league-premier-league-championship-finances;4
311;311;5557;5557;Starmer flies the flags in test drive of patriotic pitch to voters | John Crace;2022-01-04T19:56:16Z;['John Crace'];['Keir Starmer', 'Labour', 'Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"Call it a trial run. With parliament still on recess (what better way for MPs to endear themselves to the country than to award themselves an extra day off over the new year break?), Tuesday was as good a time as any for Keir Starmer to test-drive his latest pitch to voters. If it went well, so much the better: he would be ahead of the game. But if parts fell flat then there would be plenty of time to put them right in more important speeches ahead. Such as ones where more than a handful of people outside Westminster were listening. Yet even though the stakes couldn’t have been much lower, the Labour leader was leaving nothing to chance. The set was the full Liz “Gloriana” Truss, with two large union jacks for a backdrop. If it took draping himself in flags to prove that he – and the Labour party – were patriotic then so be it. Keir didn’t care if he was laying it on a bit thick. He would bathe in red, white and blue if necessary. Whatever it took. Starmer started as he meant to go on by celebrating the country we live in. Remembering how lucky he – and we – are to be British. We have the Queen. The NHS. The rule of law. The Queen. Musicians. Universities. The Queen. The BBC. Fashion. The Queen. But it wasn’t unpatriotic to suggest there might be one or two areas where there was room for improvement. Over the course of the pandemic, the British people and the opposition had done the decent thing by giving the government the benefit of the doubt. But the government had betrayed that trust by thinking the rules didn’t apply to them. Not just the serial liar and party organiser Boris Johnson. The betrayal went far deeper than that, into a Tory party that had been in power too long and took the country for granted. So replacing the prime minister with Truss or Rishi Sunak would make no difference. What was needed was a new Labour government. So far, so good. But then it all got a little vague. After bigging up the achievements of Atlee – he even dared mention nuclear weapons, Wilson and Blair governments – the best that Starmer could offer was a new social contract. If we worked hard and obeyed the rules, Labour would give us security, prosperity and respect. Which was fine, as far as it went. But it didn’t quite feel as substantial as founding the NHS, Nato, the Open University and the national minimum wage. He also promised to make Brexit work. Which could have been a little rash as no one has, as yet, come close to even the vaguest hint of how they intend to do that. Starmer was more assertive when it came to the media Q&A at the end. After grabbing the moral high ground by pointing out the government’s failure to prepare schools for the new term, and that it had only been down to Labour votes that it had been able to implement plan B, Keir took on both Corbyns. First Piers and the anti-vaxxers, then Jeremy. He made no apology for having pretended to sign up to the Corbyn masterplan only to ditch it once he became leader. He was in the business of winning elections rather than being in opposition. The public had had their chance to vote for Jeremy’s manifesto in 2019 and had given Boris an 80-seat majority. Enough was enough. And no, Johnson was most definitely not the sort of prime minister who should be knighted. The speech hadn’t been quite as polished as Starmer might have ideally liked but it had been more than a decent marker towards the next election. And it was certainly enough to spook the Tories into bringing forward the Downing Street press conference by a day. Boris couldn’t take the risk of Starmer grabbing all the headlines on the evening news bulletins. Or for Keir to be seen as the only leader working. You could tell that Johnson didn’t really have anything new to say at the presser because he took an age saying it. That’s one of Boris’s most telling giveaways. His bullshit and waffle meters work perfectly in sync. Just about the only part of his government that does. So what we got was a lot of hesitation, repetition and deviation. We have a prime minister whose only discernible current talent – other than as a party host – is to talk complete bollocks. His main message was that Omicron was very serious but not so serious for him to need to do much about it. Rather, we should accept that his hands are tied by the libertarian maniacs on the right of the party who couldn’t even accept wearing a mask on public transport. So, as the chances of them approving anything more than that was nil, and imposing further restrictions for a second time with Labour votes was politically unacceptable, we were stuck where we were. Sticking to plan B and keeping our fingers tightly crossed.
Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance alluded to problems with this approach but stopped short of spelling them out. So it was left to the media. Johnson talked of hospitals not getting overwhelmed, when at least eight trusts are already operating on an emergency footing without the staff or protective equipment to treat their patients. “Um, er, just get boosted,” he said. He hasn’t even realised that the vaccination programme has stalled. Here we were. With an incompetent prime minister who was making decisions for entirely the wrong reasons. And we would just have to sit tight and hope it somehow turned out for the best. Starmer must have been watching and thinking maybe he had less work to do on his speech than he had imagined.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/04/starmer-flies-the-flags-in-test-drive-of-patriotic-pitch-to-voters;1
312;312;5558;5558;Twitter permanently bans news aggregation service Politics For All;2022-01-04T19:48:14Z;['Jim Waterson'];['X', 'UK news', 'Internet', 'Media', 'Technology'];"Twitter has permanently banned the popular news aggregation service Politics For All, in a sign of how the social media platform has substantial power to deprive news outlets of their audience without warning. A spokesperson said the account was “suspended for violating the Twitter Rules on platform manipulation and spam” and would not be allowed to return. Politics for All, founded by 19-year-old Nick Moar, grew rapidly over the last twelve months by aggressively aggregating news stories published and reported by mainstream outlets. Its understanding of what would go viral on Twitter attracted hundreds of thousands of followers, including MPs and government ministers. However, the account was also accused of distorting stories by focusing on specifics that would go viral. Mainstream journalists also complained that its emoji-laden breaking news posts would often attract more social media shares than the posts by the outlets who actually reported the stories.
Despite this, its substantial following enabled the account to rapidly disrupt political news cycles by highlighting stories that might otherwise have been missed. It also built a relatively mainstream fanbase – with the likes of former Manchester United footballer Gary Neville among those calling for the account to be reinstated. Moar, who was last year hired by the Spectator to run its social media accounts, declined to comment on the deletion of Politics For All. Many other related accounts he set up under the For All banner, which were run with the assistance of a team of young staff, have also been permanently suspended. One individual at Politics for All said: “The fact Twitter will allow the Taliban on their platform but not a simple news aggregator is quite something. We will be appealing this decision.” However, it is unclear how the aggregator could appeal against the permanent suspension, which is similar to the treatment handed out to former US President Donald Trump. Twitter has stated the suspension is final and its rules on platform manipulation apply to users who “artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behaviour that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience”. The specific behaviour that led to Politics for All being banned remains unknown. The deletion of a relatively popular news aggregation service by Twitter could attract political scrutiny. Social media platforms will soon be regulated by Ofcom under the forthcoming online harms legislation, with mainstream journalism outlets lobbying hard to ensure their access to audiences is protected.";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/04/twitter-permanently-bans-news-aggregation-service-politics-for-all;6

Last month the rules on self-isolation in England changed to reduce the self-isolation period from 10 to seven days for people who have tested positive for Covid, provided they have a negative lateral flow test on both day six and seven and they do not have a high temperature. Wales and Northern Ireland have followed suit, with Scotland facing pressure to do the same. The guidance adds it is not necessary to continue to use lateral flow device (LFD) tests after 10 days. “You should not take any more LFD tests after the 10th day of your isolation period and you may stop self-isolating after this day,” it says. “This is because you are unlikely to be infectious after the 10th day of your isolation period.
“Even if you have a positive LFD test result on the 10th day of your self-isolation period you should not take any more LFD tests after this day.” Responding to a question from a member of the public on Tuesday, England’s chief medical officer said a lateral flow test was a helpful tool. “It is a pretty good guide, very good guide, actually, to whether someone is at that moment infectious,” Whitty said, adding that those who tested negative on day six and seven in isolation were much less likely to be infectious to other people than if they had not done those tests. But, he added: “Obviously, if they’re still positive, then they do need to stay in isolation till it goes negative.” According to government guidance lateral flow tests should not be taken before day six of the self-isolation period, but after that self-isolation may be ended after two consecutive negative tests taken at least 24 hours apart. “You should stop testing after you have had two consecutive negative test results,” the guidance states. That means the earliest someone could leave self-isolation would be day seven. Should someone test positive on day six, however, they would not be able to leave self-isolation until day eight at the earliest, after a negative lateral flow test on both day seven and day eight.However, there is a caveat for those isolating without symptoms. “If you are isolating because of a positive test result but did not have any symptoms, and you develop Covid-19 symptoms within your isolation period, start a new isolation period from the day your symptoms start,” the guidance states.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/no-need-to-isolate-after-day-10-even-with-positive-test-england-rules-say;2

On Tuesday evening, his debut, Open Water, was named winner of the Costa first novel award, praised by judges as “deeply moving, searingly intimate and just so now”. Open Water follows the lives of two young Black British artists – he a photographer, she a dancer – as they start to fall in love after meeting in a south-east London pub. It beat titles including AK Blakemore’s The Manningtree Witches and Kate Sawyer’s The Stranding to win the £5,000 Costa prize. “We all loved this contemporary portrait of masculinity – it’s like nothing else we’ve ever read,” said judges. Nelson, a British-Ghanaian short story writer and photographer, said it was “so surreal” to be named winner of the award. “I think I am honestly still getting used to the fact that I have not only put a book out, but that it’s been really well received. All writers do this – you kind of commit these acts of bravery by putting words down on the page, and then you close your eyes when you’ve done it and hope someone might read it,” he said.
Nelson quit his job at the Apple Store to write Open Water, spending the summer of 2019 in the British Library writing all day. The manuscript sparked a nine-way bidding war before ending up with Viking, an imprint of Penguin. “The main thing I was trying to hone in on was this story of intimacy between people who might feel romantically for each other – these moments that often go unnoticed and undocumented but are really the fabric of our lives,” he said. “I think that my background as a photographer means that I’m just attracted to these really tiny moments in people’s lives that l expand outwards.” Claire Fuller won the £5,000 Costa novel award for her fourth novel, Unsettled Ground, the story of 51-year-old twins Jeanie and Julius, who live in poverty and rural isolation with their mother, Dot, until her death means they are at risk of losing everything. Already shortlisted for the Women’s prize, it is a “masterpiece of storytelling and craft”, said judges. “I’m still lost for words to have won,” said Fuller, who beat authors including Nadifa Mohamed and Elif Shafak to the prize. “It’s an amazing privilege to be recognised in this way.” The novel has its roots in Fuller’s son’s discovery of an abandoned caravan in the woods. “It was derelict and empty, and my son just knows I like weird places. So I went out to see it, and it was just really atmospheric. It made me start thinking: who would have lived here? And how would they have managed?” she said. “And then Jeanie, the main character, was just created in my head without knowing what her story would be or where she came from, or even that she had a twin brother. I had no idea till I started writing it.”
John Preston won the Costa biography award for Fall: The Mystery of Robert Maxwell, which judges called an “epic, immersive, cinematic telling” of the life of the late media mogul and MP. The poetry prize went to former London teacher Hannah Lowe for The Kids, which draws on a decade of teaching in an inner-city London sixth form, and the children’s book category was won by Manjeet Mann for The Crossing, a verse novel inspired by the refugee crisis, about two teenagers from very different worlds. The Costas are open solely to authors resident in the UK and Ireland, and go to the “most enjoyable” books of the year. The Crossing, said judges, “will enrich all who read it”, while The Kids made judges “want to punch the air with joy”. A panel of judges chaired by the journalist and broadcaster Reeta Chakrabarti will now select the Costa book of the year from the five category winners, to be announced on 1 February. Last year, Monique Roffey’s novel The Mermaid of Black Conch took the overall £30,000 prize.";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/04/caleb-azumah-nelson-wins-costa-first-novel-award-for-open-water;5
316;316;5563;5563;Elizabeth Holmes trial: Silicon Valley watches next steps in high-profile case;2022-01-04T19:30:17Z;['Kari Paul'];['Theranos', 'Silicon Valley', 'Technology', 'Law (US)'];"Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was found guilty on Monday of fraud, concluding a high-profile trial that captivated Silicon Valley and chronicled the missteps of the now-defunct blood testing startup. After seven days of deliberation, the jury in San Jose, California, convicted Holmes on four charges: one count of conspiracy to defraud investors, and three counts of wire fraud against investors. It acquitted her on three charges, including one conspiracy to defraud patients and two charges related to patients who received inaccurate test results. It remained deadlocked on three remaining charges. The split verdicts are “a mixed bag for the prosecution, but it’s a loss for Elizabeth Holmes because she is going away to prison for at least a few years”, said David Ring, a lawyer who has followed the case closely. A hearing has been set for next week during which the prosecutors will reveal whether they plan to retry Holmes on the three charges the jury could not come to an agreement on. Experts say such a retrial is not very likely, as the existing convictions already carry considerable sentencing time. With no prior convictions, Holmes is unlikely to face the maximum prison time her charges carry, which is 20 years, said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers. While she will probably face several in prison and more on probation, Holmes is almost certain to appeal, Rahmani added: “She’s not someone who is going to want to do even five months in prison, much less five years,” he said. Holmes walked freely out of the courthouse on Monday after parties agreed she would not be taken into custody until her sentencing hearing. That date will be set at the hearing regarding the retrial next week. It is expected the judge will take into account the timing of the fraud trial of Holmes’ former partner, Sunny Balwani. His trial is scheduled to start next month in the same San Jose courtroom where Holmes’ legal saga unfolded.
The former CEO’s loss marks a milestone for Silicon Valley – an industry that has for years evaded accountability in its pervasive culture of “fake it till you make it” that encourages founders to make big promises, often with little proof. “Silicon Valley has thus far been famously been resistant to much prosecutorial activity, because its business model assumes you are going to take an aggressive, optimistic view of your product or service to attract investors,” said Jack Sharman, a white-collar defense lawyer at Lightfoot, a law firm in Alabama. “And if that product or service succeeds, you’re not a fraudster, you’re a visionary,” he added. Theranos sold a promise to improve health with multiple tests on one drop of blood – a claim that despite having little scientific proof raised hundreds of millions of dollars and attracted big-name investors such as the media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the former secretary of state Henry Kissinger. Once a charismatic figure, Holmes was initially hailed as a visionary. Her story represented just how far the cult of personality in Silicon Valley can take someone. That same cult of personality, however, became her downfall: during the trial, prosecutors painted a picture of Holmes as a strict, power-hungry leader willing to go to any lengths to save her company’s image, repressing internal and external dissent and manipulating the press. “She chose fraud over business failure,” prosecutor Jeff Schenk said in his closing arguments. “She chose to be dishonest with investors and patients. That choice was not only callous, it was criminal.” The verdict may embolden prosecutors at large to more aggressively pursue cases of white collar crime and fraud, said Rahmani. In turn, startups may now tread more carefully when making big promises, he added. “In Silicon Valley, this conviction will resonate with the big law firms that advise startup companies,” Rahmani said. “Attorneys are going to be advising their clients to be more careful, especially in what they say to investors.” Investors are already taking heed: Silicon Valley investor Jason Calacanis, who was an early backer of major firms like Uber and Robinhood, said the verdict was a “reminder to founders”. “Never lie, never bend the truth, always be honest about where you are at with your traction, especially when raising money,” he tweeted.

Family members had reported the man missing from the park early on Monday, the National Park Service said. Officials believe the accident occurred late on Sunday evening. Park rangers and firefighters had searched through the night to locate the missing man, and eventually recovered his body 100ft (30.48m) below the crater rim of the Uēkahuna viewing area at the summit of the Kilauea volcano. An investigation is under way, officials said in a statement, and identification of the man is “pending further notification of family”. Thousands of people have visited the park at night to view the glowing lava lake since the volcano began erupting in September. The eruption, Hawaii News Now reported, “[sent] up fiery fountains as high as 100 feet and [flooded] the floor of Halemaumau Crater with lava”. A 32-year-old army soldier was seriously injured in May 2019 after falling from a 300ft cliff into the crater while trying to get a better view of Kīlauea, NPR reported.;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/hawaii-volcanoes-national-park-man-body-kilauea;3
318;318;5565;5565;Can the Virginia Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein deal protect Prince Andrew?;2022-01-04T19:09:30Z;['Edward Helmore'];['Prince Andrew', 'UK news', 'US news', 'Jeffrey Epstein', 'Ghislaine Maxwell'];"The merits of Virginia Giuffre’s sex assault lawsuit against Prince Andrew are still far from being tested in court. In New York on Tuesday, lawyers for the prince asked a judge, Lewis Kaplan, to stop the case ever getting there.
Commenting on the case, other New York lawyers were doubtful that Andrew’s legal team would be successful and questioned why the prince’s representatives had not settled out-of-court. Andrew says he has no memory of meeting Giuffre and vehemently denies alleged assaults in London, New York and the US Virgin Islands when Giuffre was 17. On Tuesday, the lawyer Andrew Brad Brettler argued that the case against the prince should be thrown out, on the basis of a 2009 financial settlement between Giuffre and the financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Kaplan released the text of the 2009 settlement on Monday. It showed Giuffre agreed to “remise, release, acquit, satisfy and forever discharge the said second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant”. Brettler also said Giuffre’s claims were not adequately described in her complaint against Andrew, which he said was filed just five days short of the closing of a statute of limitations window in the New York state Child Victims Act. Jeanne Christensen of Wigdor, a law firm with clients including a woman who alleges rape and harassment by the Wall Street financier and Epstein associate Leon Black and claimants in civil suits against the disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, said Andrew was almost certainly not covered by the 2009 agreement. Imprecise wording suggests the existence of a second agreement with named parties that has never come to light, Christensen said. “Aside from the fact that it’s horribly worded with over-broad, vague language, it really should not be sustained because it could cover anybody Epstein knows,” she said. “It doesn’t matter who [Andrew’s] lawyers think falls within that definition. It’s not going to be of help.” The lawyer Alan Dershowitz has claimed the agreement releases him from Giuffre’s claims against him. But Christensen said: “I don’t see how any person could fit within that definition without there being a second agreement that specifically names individuals.” Eric Baum, an attorney representing a woman in civil sexual misconduct claims against the American Apparel founder, Dov Charney, and restaurateur Mario Batali, said Prince Andrew and his legal team were “grasping at straws”. “They have concocted a baseless defense to serious allegations of sexual assault,” he said. “Prince Andrew’s lawyers are attempting to rely on a settlement agreement that was entered into between Epstein and Ms Giuffre in a different court. “Prince Andrew was not a party in that case, was not mentioned by name in the release and has not provided anything in return for the release he seeks to use. In essence, Prince Andrew’s legal team’s argument would let any individual who commits a wrongdoing against Ms Giuffre off the hook because of the release she signed with Epstein.” Others were less certain that the Epstein settlement does not cover Andrew, since it was made years after alleged assaults which Giuffre would have had in mind when she and her lawyers agreed to the “potential defendant” language. Julie Rendelman, a New York criminal defence lawyer, said: “The question is, when she’s signing this agreement with Epstein she would have been well aware that Prince Andrew would have been one of the potential respondents in a civil lawsuit, and she chose to go forward with it. “She would have known full well that he could be articulated as being included in that.”
At the end of last week, there was a sense that criminal prosecutions arising from Epstein’s behaviour could end with the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell, his former girlfriend, on sex-trafficking charges. On Tuesday, Judge Kaplan said he would decide “soon” if the civil case against Prince Andrew should be dismissed. But Christensen, of Wigdor, doubted that the affair was close to an end. “I don’t think it’s over, and that’s partly because Epstein is becoming an even bigger issue in my own litigation,” she said. For a New York attorney, Christensen added, it was hard to fathom why the Giuffre-Prince Andrew lawsuit had not been settled. “I can’t believe they haven’t gotten rid of it already. I don’t get it, but then we don’t have a monarchy. It’s a head-scratcher that it’s ongoing to the degree that it is.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-jeffrey-epstein-deal;1
319;319;5566;5566;‘It’s damaging for the City’: post-holiday London streets stay quiet;2022-01-04T19:09:03Z;['Joanna Partridge'];['Business', 'Work & careers', 'Financial sector', 'London', 'Coronavirus', 'UK news'];"As the bells chimed one o’clock in the City of London on Tuesday, the typical lunchtime exodus from the offices in the capital’s financial district was barely a trickle. A handful of workers left the Bank of England on Threadneedle Street on their lunch breaks, but most of the scattering of people were dressed for a day shopping or sightseeing rather than sitting behind their desks. In normal times, Tuesday would have marked the first day back in the workplace after the Christmas festivities for millions of the nation’s office-based employees. Despite data suggesting that the Omicron Covid-19 variant is less severe than other versions of the virus, coupled with figures indicating that cases in the capital have stabilised, staff at most large offices appeared to be continuing to work from home. The morning rush hour in London remained well below pre-pandemic levels, according to data from Transport for London. Before 10am on Tuesday morning, TfL reported about 770,000 taps on its buses and about 710,000 entry and exits across the tube network, representing significantly fewer passengers than seen when workers returned in January 2020. Then, about 6m daily trips were made by bus, and 4m by tube.
Those commuting to the capital have had to wrestle with severely curtailed services, with all Southern trains to and from London Victoria cancelled until 10 January as a result of pandemic-related staffing shortages, and services reduced across the network. Scotrail has cut about 8% (160) of its services from the 2,000 trains it runs normally. Figures from the satnav maker TomTom showed morning rush hour congestion on roads in city centres including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Cardiff remained at half the levels seen at in early January 2020, before the UK pandemic, or even lower. Most of the workers who had nipped out at lunchtime in the City to buy a sandwich or to stretch their legs said they had come to the office to do specific tasks, or because they preferred it to working from home. A financial services worker, Sam Lowres, 23, walking back to the office at the end of his lunch break, had been surprised by how quiet the City was. An employee at the Aquis Exchange, Lowres has only been worked in the district for six months since graduating from university last summer. He said he much preferred working from his desk, where he had a better computer set-up. “I live in a small flat. There is more space to work in the office and a separation from home,” he said. “Lots of places are encouraging working from home until at least the end of January.” Walking past the Royal Exchange, Patrick Tomlinson, the head of business continuity and crisis management at the investment bank Rothschild & Co, said he had to complete some work that could only be done in the office, and was taking advantage of a quiet workplace. “I can come in later to avoid peak travel time. The company has a flexible approach,” he said, adding that the firm was monitoring Covid data to decide how to proceed.
The solicitors Gorkem Ozsoy and Caryn Toh said their work required them to be in the office at least some of the time, whether meeting clients or preparing for in-person court hearings. “The nature of the job doesn’t allow working from home all the time,” said Ozsoy. “Initially everyone worked from home for the first six months [of the pandemic]. Now everyone has had enough, or wants to return.” Toh added: “We have to prepare court bundles and I usually prefer to be in the office for that.” When the government once again tightened its coronavirus guidance in early December, urging office-based staff in England to work from home where possible, many large corporates decided to take a more flexible approach than earlier in the pandemic. Large office-based businesses including the insurance firms Legal & General and Aviva are among those who have decided to keep their office buildings open. Aviva, which has a 16,000-strong workforce in the UK, said staff who could not work from home for any reason could attend its offices. L&G said it was keeping its offices and cafes open for any of its 7,000 UK employees “who cannot work effectively from home”, including those who need to work in the office for their mental wellbeing. Inside the City’s historic Leadenhall Market, many of the grab-and-go sandwich shops and coffee bars, which in pre-Covid times would have expected queues out of the door most lunchtimes, remained shuttered. Some had stuck handwritten signs in the window, stating they would reopen the following week, while others gave no indication when they would return. A beauty therapist, Sue Durrant, based at the Chequers hair and beauty salon in the covered market, said she had seen just one customer on Tuesday. “It’s the first day back and I’ve got no one else booked in,” she said. “It’s been really quiet and everyone seems to be working from home. It’s really damaging for the City.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/its-damaging-for-the-city-post-holiday-london-streets-stay-quiet;2
320;320;5567;5567;Mount Owen was beautiful, the views majestic but halfway up I decided I needed a nap | Naomi Arnold;2022-01-04T19:00:20Z;['N/A'];['New Zealand', 'Asia Pacific'];"The first time I walked up Mount Owen, I horrified my boyfriend by curling up beneath one of its famous water-riven karst outcrops and insisting I needed to sleep. We’d broken up six months before, and had just gotten back together to give it another go. That morning, we were both questioning our life choices. The previous day had been fine – a decent seven hours of walking, climbing a ridge through mountain beech, sidling along a rocky cliff streaming with water, and clambering up a dry riverbed to Granity Pass Hut, a simple 12-bunk alpine hut just past the treeline. But we’d bickered all morning as the sun rose behind us and we hiked up the massif towards the summit, through the bronzed alpine meadow known as the Hay Paddock, past still mountain tarns reflecting the sky.
It was beautiful, but I was getting slower and grumpier, and finally announced I needed a lie-down in the tussock. He looked at me, aghast. He really wanted to get to the top – at 1,875 metres, Mt Owen is the highest point in Kahurangi National Park, which covers the north-western corner of the top of New Zealand’s South Island. The views are majestic. I no longer cared. “Go,” I said, waving weakly from my spot beneath the sun-warmed rock. “It’s sunny. I’ll wait here. I’m fine. I’m just so tired.” He stood over me, considering. “This is not a place to nap,” he said, and hauled me up like a cast ruminant and prodded me towards the top. You do need your wits about you on the glaciated marble karst of Mt Owen. Full of slots and holes, its insides are riven with caves, some of the longest in the world. To get to the top, you have to spend a couple of hours hopping from rock to rock across sharply carved cracks. A fall would require surgery or a body bag, and like all of New Zealand, the weather can change suddenly. Eventually, I made it. I collapsed on the smooth grey rock and watched other trampers bound about taking pictures. I lay on my pack and stared into the layers of bluish mountain ranges, hazy in the January summer heat as my boyfriend grimly prepared himself to spend the rest of the day coaxing me back down to the car, imagining lots of pack-carrying and whining. But on the way back down, I came right – and when we were sorting out our rubbish at the carpark, I realised what had happened. The freeze-dried meal I’d had for breakfast, a product sample from a friend, had actually contained two servings of high-energy scrambled eggs, bacon and hollandaise – about 1,600 calories. No wonder I was comatose; I’d had a Christmas dinner’s worth of rehydrated eggs before trying to stagger to the summit. I showed him the packet, and he just shook his head.

321;321;5568;5568;Travel red tape risks making ‘mockery’ of Champions Cup, warns Sanderson;2022-01-04T18:59:35Z;['Gerard Meagher'];['Champions Cup', 'Sale', 'Rugby union', 'Sport'];"Attempts to press ahead with the forthcoming European fixtures have been dealt a fresh blow after it emerged South African players based in the UK face further red tape to gain entry into France with the Sale director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, saying the Champions Cup could be made into a “mockery”. European Professional Club Rugby, the organiser of the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup, remains in discussions over two rounds of fixtures this month after matches were postponed in December when France limited entry from the UK to “essential only”. EPCR is hopeful of gaining the necessary exemptions to allow fixtures to go ahead.
On Tuesday, Sanderson revealed a further complication, however, with Sale’s South African players facing additional visa requirements. It is understood EPCR is aware of the problem, though its priority remains getting the fixtures played in the first place. Sanderson, though, is adamant Sale would not be able to field a competitive side away to Clermont on 16 January if his South African contingent cannot travel and said they were not the only club to raise the issue. In addition, the French government has mandated that all sportspeople be fully vaccinated from 15 January, which would further reduce the number of players available to Sanderson. “There’s a certain type of visa you get if you’re South African, which has to be approved,” he said. “They’d have to fast-track and approve these Schengen visas in record time. Apparently it’s only a stamp but it’s out of our hands. “This is entirely in the lap of European Rugby and their ability to push it through and then the French government to approve it. It doesn’t give us a competitive team. There are nine of our squad who wouldn’t be approved and that’s not even including some of the lads who aren’t double-jabbed, of which there’s one or two. We’re not the only ones, we’re all in a similar boat.” Asked about fielding a second‑string side if his South African players are not granted exemption, Sanderson said: “It’s a mockery of the cup then, isn’t it? We’re in it to play the best teams with our best team. So no, I wouldn’t even consider taking a second team to Clermont to get beaten up.”
Even if EPCR receives the green light for this month’s fixtures, when to replay those postponed last month has not been resolved. “I do think [the tournament] is in trouble, not through its own fault,” Sanderson said. “We have all had to deal internally with Covid and all the issues and curveballs that come up because of it. There is no space in the season to reschedule these games. There is none so how do you continue with the tournament in its old structure? I can’t see how you can if we can’t field our best team to come to France or the game isn’t played.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/04/european-club-competitions-in-trouble-over-covid-and-visas;4
322;322;5569;5569;Extremist groups continue to ‘metastasize and recruit’ after Capitol attack, study finds;2022-01-04T18:56:26Z;['N/A'];['US Capitol attack', 'US news', 'US politics', 'The far right'];"In the year since the 6 January insurrection, many US extremist groups haven’t fully recovered from blows landed by increased scrutiny of law enforcement and purges from big tech social media platforms, a new report has found.
The research, by the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, found that 12 months after the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob some far-right groups had been gripped by paranoia as authorities traced and arrested participants. But others had reorganized, often with an emphasis on local-level politics and a developing eco-system of far-right social media. The report warned some groups have “made troubling progress by shifting to alternative online platforms, embracing rhetoric to engage more broadly with the mainstream conservative base and engaging in new political activities, particularly public health and education issues at the local level”. The report’s author, Jared Holt, combined investigative reporting along with monitoring and analysis of open source information to produce a report on the characteristics of US extremism movements a year after the Capitol attack. The report details how extremist movements were riddled with paranoia following the capitol riot, with members holding widespread suspicion of each other and law enforcement, leading many members to be discouraged from attending public events. Big tech companies also purged many extremists off their platforms, forcing them to disperse across the internet on to smaller, more obscure sites, without a unifying place to congregate online. The Guardian has reported how the adoption of smaller platforms and less sophisticated alt-tech made extremists vulnerable to data scrapes, breaches and hacks. The report links how some entrepreneurs have responded by creating alternative platforms, independent from current mainstream digital providers. The report quotes the Gab chief executive, Anrew Torba, who says he is trying to build a “parallel Christian economy”. The report warns of the rise of far-right influencers inside these alternative social media platforms and the dangers that they could bring. It said: “These developments offer extremists sufficient conditions to continue metastasizing and recruiting. Though most online tools adopted by extremists enable them to reach smaller audiences than those possible on mainstream social media, they may be more effective in intensifying the radicalization of individuals already engaged with them.” Some extremist movements have tried to re-enter the mainstream by hitching on to suburban conservative causes, even adopting traditional political methods like forming non-profits, phone banking and hosting conferences. “As fruitful opportunity for creating outrage and hate, extremists have embraced emotionally charged social issues as an entry vehicle into mainstream online discourse,” the report said. Far-right figures like the former top Trump aide Steven Bannon have encouraged a “precinct by precinct” strategy, a ground-up approach that focuses on local politics. The Guardian recently reported how far-right groups have shifted their focus to local communities.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/extremist-groups-recruit-post-capitol-attack-new-study-finds;1
323;323;5570;5570;Liverpool ask for Carabao Cup semi-final to be postponed amid more Covid cases;2022-01-04T18:45:37Z;['Andy Hunter'];['Liverpool', 'Arsenal', 'Carabao Cup', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Liverpool have requested the postponement of their Carabao Cup semi‑final at Arsenal on Thursday after more positive tests for Covid-19 at the club. The club submitted the request to the EFL on Tuesday having cancelled a planned training session in response to a rising number of positive tests, other illnesses and injuries.
Jürgen Klopp, three members of his staff and three players – Alisson, Roberto Firmino and Joël Matip – missed the draw at Chelsea on Sunday having tested positive. The Liverpool manager has mild symptoms but is fine, according to the club. Nine Liverpool players were missing at Stamford Bridge as a consequence of Covid, injuries and suspension, and Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and Naby Keïta have subsequently reported for the Africa Cup of Nations. Further positive tests on Tuesday prompted Liverpool to request the postponement. The club are awaiting a decision from the EFL and face more problems with the fixture schedule should the request be granted. The Carabao Cup final is scheduled to take place on 27 February and there is limited midweek availability for a rearranged game before that time. Klopp has stated he would prefer the semi-final to be decided over one leg. “The Reds have formally requested to the EFL that the fixture is rescheduled after further suspected positive tests were registered among players and staff, allied to other factors impacting selection, including illness and injury,” said Liverpool, referring to positive lateral flow tests, with PCR results awaited.
In response, the club halted preparations at the Axa Training Centre, meaning Tuesday’s first‑team training session was cancelled. Among the considerations which led to today’s application to the EFL is the need for travelling supporters to be given as much notice as possible of any potential postponement. “With no prospect of the current situation improving ahead of Thursday’s fixture and the potential for it to worsen, the club considers it both prudent and reasonable to ask for the fixture to be rescheduled.” The EFL said the request would “be considered in accordance with the competition rules as set out at the start of the season alongside information submitted by the club” and a decision would be confirmed as soon as possible. Liverpool would have to prove to the EFL that they do not have 14 fit players (11 starting and three substitutes) who are eligible to feature in the Carabao Cup.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/liverpool-request-carabao-cup-semi-final-arsenal-postponement-covid-efl;4
324;324;5571;5571;Cornelius Kersten, the speed skater who has ended Team GB’s long wait;2022-01-04T18:44:29Z;['Paul MacInnes'];['Winter Olympics Beijing 2022', 'Speed skating', 'Team GB', 'Winter Olympics', 'Sport'];"“I want to put down the best possible race I can,” says Cornelius Kersten, the first British long-track speed skater to make a Winter Olympics in 30 years. “To get the official word a few days ago was like a weight falling off the shoulders. It’s official now, it’s actually going to happen and it feels amazing. My ambition is now to be there in the best shape of my life.” The history of British Olympic speed skating is hardly voluminous, one bronze medal being the extent of it. Of late, Elise Christie has helped to burnish the national reputation in the short‑track form, with the Scot winning world and European titles, but the long track – the icy equivalent of a track cycling time trial – has been out of the reach of these temperate isles for a generation.
Kersten qualifies after a number of personal bests in the World Cup series last year and will compete in the 1,000m and 1,500m events. His success comes after years of dedication and development, often without any official funding, and he has grown alongside his partner, the fellow British speed skater Ellia Smeding. They share a passion and a business but also a location, one that in speed skating is worth almost half a second in itself: the Netherlands. It is speed skating’s pre-eminent nation: there is a Wikipedia page dedicated to Dutch records in the sport. Kersten’s father is Dutch and also a passionate skater, one who completed the Elfstedentocht; a 200km, 11-city race that has not been staged since 1997 because it has not been cold enough. Raised in the Netherlands, Kersten has absorbed that Dutch culture – “People are very into it and they’ve been doing it for centuries and most people think they know best” – and is also part of Heerenveen’s Team Worldstream Corendon, known as the NXTGN and marketed like a team of esport professionals.
Yet Kersten says he skates like a Briton. “How me and El go at it is [not to say] we know best but: ‘OK, what can we learn.’” And when he came to the last year of his career as a youth skater, he chose to represent the country of his mother. “I had the option to compete for the Netherlands, but I switched,” he says, citing the influence of Stephen Airey, the man who helped to build the British long-track programme and continues to work as its development manager in a voluntary capacity. “He was the one who gave us the room to grow and I’d always wanted to represent Team GB, so it became a really easy decision to make,” Kersten says. Smeding shares a similar biography, and the pair have been living together in Heerenveen, round the corner from the Thialf ice arena, and skating for the past three years. That skating has often been at night, however, as during the day they are busy roasting, packaging and shipping coffee beans. Brew ’22 is the name of the couple’s company and it has been a success, generating funds that have allowed them to continue competing, with Kersten otherwise qualifying for only IOC solidarity funding. Kersten says he would not recommend running a business to any other active athlete. “Coffee is my passion and Brew is our little baby so it’s very easy to put a lot of time and effort into it, but it does sometimes take time and energy when you would rather have a nap in the afternoon.”
His preferred drink is a filter coffee and he would like to convert others to the more subtle flavours of a pour-over brew. But before that he would like to give long-track skating a kickstart in the UK. “I think the sport needs to grow and we need more recognition. I’d like to inspire people to get involved and hopefully get a track in the UK. At the moment we’re a small sport, and I hope the Games will help that.” Long-track skating is a sport that has finally come in from the cold and, while Kersten is unlikely to return from Beijing with a medal, he makes for an effective ambassador. What, in the end, does he love the most about his discipline? “For me that’s the speed of it. When you throw yourself into a corner at 40mph you’re in control but you’re also slightly out of control, too. One wrong move and you’re out, you’re flying into the cushions. But if you hit it right, you absolutely blast through … and that’s amazing.” • This article was amended on 5 January 2022.

325;325;5572;5572;US reports global record of more than 1m daily Covid cases;2022-01-04T18:43:07Z;['Alexandra Villarreal', 'Samantha Lock'];['Coronavirus', 'US news', 'Omicron variant', 'World news'];"As the highly transmissible Omicron variant wreaks havoc in the US, more than 1.08 million people across the country tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday – a global daily record, data from Johns Hopkins University revealed. The deluge of infections is forcing government officials, employers and citizens to weigh their risk tolerance as Americans enter year three of a devastating pandemic that has upended lives and livelihoods. Although evidence suggests Omicron is generally more mild and less lethal than other strains, the volume of new cases has been followed by an increase in hospitalizations, threatening to once again overwhelm beleaguered hospitals. Medical experts are sounding the alarm that the Omicron wave could be particularly harmful to children, as pediatric admissions of patients with Covid-19 reach record highs.
“This narrative that it’s just a mild virus is not accurate,” Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN. “We’ve just done a terrible job vaccinating our kids across the country. So even though there’s a lot of happy talk about the Omicron variant, less severe disease, when you add up all the factors … we’ve got a very serious situation facing us in this country, especially for the kids.” Monday’s number of new cases was almost double the previous record of about 590,000, set four days before. While delays in reporting over the holiday period may have played a role, the new record could be a significant underestimate. Many Americans are relying on tests taken at home with results not reported to authorities. Amid the deepening crisis, schools and businesses are facing difficult decisions. Classrooms in cities including Detroit, Los Angeles, Newark, Milwaukee, Cleveland and Atlanta are closing as infections soar, opting for virtual learning or delaying students’ return. But the move toward online education has become one of the greatest dividing issues of the pandemic. Officials as politically polarized as Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, and New York’s new Democratic mayor, Eric Adams, have vehemently defended in-person learning, even amid the surge in cases. “We want to be extremely clear: the safest place for our children is a school building,” Adams said. Omicron has also created chaos in the economy. Thousands of flights have been canceled or delayed amid staffing shortages, many Broadway shows have had to cancel performances after positive tests, and hospitals and emergency response departments including police have been left understaffed as workers call out sick. Some companies hoping to return to the office in 2022 watched the first Monday of the year come and go as they instructed employees to work from home for at least another few weeks. Others are keeping their doors open by reducing quarantine periods for workers, according to new and controversial guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Monday night, Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center in uptown Manhattan, tweeted about how the new wave of hospitalizations was “different” but “scary”. “Today it seemed like everyone had Covid. Like, so many,” he wrote, after leaving an emergency department filled with Covid patients. “And yes, like before, there were some really short of breath and needing oxygen. But for most, Covid seemed to topple a delicate balance of an underlying illness. “It’s making people really sick in a different way.” Diabetics with the virus were, he said, going into diabetic ketoacidosis – “a serious and life-threatening condition” – while many elderly patients feel too weak to walk. Covid patients were being placed in beds beside cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or others who are immunocompromised, Spencer wrote, causing even more concern. “The next few weeks will be really, really tough for us,” Spencer wrote. “A lot of healthcare workers will get sick. We will have to work short-staffed and take on more patients. “If you haven’t been vaccinated or boosted yet, now is really the time. It makes a difference. I know you’re tired of this. We are too. But we’ll really need everyone’s help to get through it, again.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/us-global-record-more-than-1m-daily-covid-cases;7
326;326;5573;5573;Eritrean refugee was traumatised by friend’s suicide, UK inquest hears;2022-01-04T18:32:31Z;['Amelia Gentleman'];['Immigration and asylum', 'Eritrea', 'Africa', 'UK news', 'World news'];An Eritrean asylum seeker who killed himself shortly after his 18th birthday was worried about his application to remain in the UK and was traumatised by the recent suicide of a close friend, another Eritrean asylum seeker, an inquest has heard. The examination of the circumstances leading to the death of Alexander Tekle is the fourth inquest to be heard into the suicides of four Eritreans within a 16-month period. Collectively, the inquests have put a spotlight on how young, unaccompanied asylum seekers are looked after by local authorities on arrival in the UK. Tekle killed himself on 6 December 2017, a few weeks after his friend Filmon Yemane was found dead. Friends told the inquest that Tekle was profoundly traumatised by experiences he had in Eritrea that had prompted him to flee, and also by the long and dangerous journey he had made to the UK. He was violently attacked in Calais, and arrived in Britain hidden in a refrigerated lorry in December 2016. Tekle told his first social worker in Kent that he was having trouble sleeping and had nightmares, but the social worker did not make detailed inquiries into what was causing this. Over the 12 months he was in the UK, Tekle became homeless and was seriously injured in a stabbing. He started drinking heavily, and friends told the inquest they believed this was a way of dealing with the trauma he had experienced. Tekle gave the wrong date of birth on arrival in the UK, and spent months trying to correct the error. As a consequence of the mistake, he was registered as older than he was. He was quickly transferred to adult refugee services and was no longer eligible for some of the specialist, child-focused support he may otherwise have received. Solicitors asked his social worker in Kent, where he was originally placed before he was deemed to have turned 18, whether there had been a reluctance to fix the mistaken age in order to minimise the period during which the council was responsible for his wellbeing. The social worker denied that this had been a factor in the decision not to exercise discretion and accept the evidence provided by Tekle indicating that he was younger. Benjamin Hunter, a volunteer who had met Tekle in Calais when he was living in the camp there, tried repeatedly to alert officials who were working with him to Tekle’s deteriorating mental health. Addressing the inquest by phone from Sudan, speaking with the assistance of an interpreter, Tekle’s father said his son was loving and caring, had many friends, a good sense of humour and a passion for cycling. “I hoped that he would be safe in the UK, build his life there, go to college, study and one day get married and have his own children,” Tecle Tesfamichel said. “If anything can come from this tragedy, I hope that lessons can be learned to prevent this from happening to another young person. Alex has gone, we can never bring him back, but I don’t want another young person to go through what he did.” Friends paid tribute to Tekle. “He was the nicest person that I have ever met. He had so much charisma,” Sham Aklilu said in a statement read out to the inquest. Tekle was the second of four Eritrean refugees, all friends, to kill themselves. Filmon Yemane had recently turned 18 when he took his life in November 2017. Osman Ahmed Nur, 19, was found dead on 10 May 2018 in a communal area of a young people’s hostel in Camden, north London. Mulubrhane Medhane Kfleyosus, 19, was found dead on 18 February 2019 in Milton Keynes. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

327;327;5574;5574;The Guardian view on Covid and schools: crossed fingers aren’t enough | Editorial ;2022-01-04T18:30:19Z;['Editorial'];['Schools', 'Coronavirus', 'Education', 'Department for Education', 'UK news', 'Nadhim Zahawi'];"There are grounds to hope that cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant may already have peaked in some areas, including London, and also that the cumulative damage of the disease it causes will turn out to be less than in the more alarming scenarios described by scientists. But as pupils and teachers return to school, there remains cause for serious concern. It is unsurprising, based on the experience of the past two years, that the education department’s latest measures appear closer to a sticking-plaster than a strategy. But this does not make it acceptable. The publication of an open letter from the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, 48 hours before many schools were due to reopen, and the sudden announcement that 7,000 air purifiers would be available for classrooms, smack of homework left until the end of the holidays. Aspects of the regime that has been imposed until the end of January in England, with mandatory mask-wearing in secondary classrooms and recommended twice-weekly testing, are sensible (the devolved administrations have their own arrangements, with masks already in place in Scottish high schools, for example). Ministers are right to make a priority of keeping schools open. Also welcome is the reframed guidance about the vulnerable children who must be regarded as one of the state’s most urgent responsibilities, in the event of further closures. An increase in child abuse was a predictable consequence of the pandemic, and more should have been done to help social services cope; following devastating evidence in cases including the murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, ministers have belatedly acted on some of the risks. The suggestion that classes should double up, or that non-teaching staff might take charge of lessons, however, is more likely to alienate teachers than reassure them. Mr Zahawi’s reference to the “blitz spirit”, and the MP Jonathan Gullis’s cheery approval of a “teach army” of volunteers, were presumably aimed at boosting morale. But two years into a pandemic, with many parts of England still waiting for Omicron cases to spike, and ventilation issues unresolved (with open windows not a straightforward solution in colder periods or areas), the government would do better to focus on meaningful engagement with teachers and their unions than to issue nostalgic calls to arms. Headteachers and schools have stepped up, under Covid, working extremely hard to minimise the disruption not only to children’s education but also to their lives. But with workforce recruitment and retention already known to be a serious problem for schools, as it is in the NHS, there are real worries that the pressures of the pandemic – including the threat to health for those required to spend all day in buildings with large numbers of unvaccinated people – could make a difficult situation worse. GCSE and A-level examinations are only a few months off. Finding a fair way to manage these, despite inevitable interruptions and without exaggerating existing divisions (such as between private and state schools), will be hard. Useful work could also be done via schools in relation to vaccine misinformation and encouraging uptake, particularly in cities where it is low. The Treasury must provide additional resources to meet costs such as emergency cover for absences. Ministers and officials at the Department for Education should be mindful that, as in a foreign language test, listening to teachers is as important as speaking to them.";https://www.theguardian.com/education/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-covid-and-schools-crossed-fingers-arent-enough;2
328;328;5575;5575;The Guardian view on soaring energy bills: the less well-off need a new deal | Editorial;2022-01-04T18:28:19Z;['Editorial'];['Fuel poverty', 'Energy bills', 'Consumer affairs', 'Household bills', 'Poverty', 'Society', 'Universal credit', 'Social exclusion', 'Kwasi Kwarteng', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Keir Starmer', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"Even before global energy prices began to soar last spring, too many people in Britain could not afford to keep their homes warm in a cold winter. This year – amid a wider cost-of-living crisis driven by high inflation, a looming rise in national insurance and stagnating wages – spiralling heating bills threaten to tip the household budgets of millions over the edge. According to calculations by the charity National Energy Action, six million families risk becoming fuel poor by the spring, when the energy price cap is expected to be significantly raised. This would be the highest number since such records began to be kept in 1996. The bottom line of this crisis, for those at its sharp end, could not be more stark. Rishi Sunak’s culpably shortsighted decision to remove the universal credit uplift in the autumn stripped £20 a week from the bank accounts of the poor. In the absence of expanded fuel subsidies from the government, more and more of Britain’s less well-off families will be forced into desperate, humiliating choices between food, warmth and other essentials. Parents will go without to make sure their children eat a decent meal. Unheated homes will lead to greater ill health, while higher debt will bring spiralling levels of stress and anxiety. To mitigate this, the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng, who meets the UK’s major energy suppliers this week, needs a plan that is morally fit for purpose. As Labour’s leader, Keir Starmer, has pointed out, the government could by now have cut VAT on energy bills, offering some relief to consumers. A mooted £20bn state loan to the major energy companies may help to flatten the curve of rising prices. But given that the rise in the price cap in April could be as much as 50%, the government urgently needs to show some pre-emptive empathy and solidarity with those who will disproportionately suffer the consequences. Options are available. As National Energy Action has recommended, eligibility for the winter fuel allowance should no longer be restricted to pensioners but include all on low incomes. The warm home discount scheme could be expanded, and Treasury funds used to alleviate the levels of debt accrued by hard-pressed families through no fault of their own. Some of the money for this could come from a windfall tax on North Sea gas producers, who are making record profits as a result of the crisis; the government’s own VAT and booming carbon tax receipts could also be deployed. In the longer term, this crisis should be the final wake-up call when it comes to dealing with the chronic levels of energy inefficiency in so many British homes. A joined-up, properly financed plan to insulate and retrofit social housing to make it zero-carbon would significantly reduce household bills for the poor, reduce emissions and act as a catalyst for wider transformation. Yet in the autumn budget, Mr Sunak chose to halve the money available for a home upgrade grant targeted at improving energy efficiency in fuel-poor homes, while the failed green homes grant scheme has dented industry confidence. Dealing with the coming energy crunch will require imagination, fiscal generosity and a recognition that – in a market that risks becoming unsustainably dysfunctional – state intervention is to be embraced rather than avoided. Sadly, with this government, that may be too much to ask.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-soaring-energy-bills-the-less-well-off-need-a-new-deal;1
329;329;5576;5576;Apple’s $3tn valuation is not as ridiculous as it seems | Nils Pratley;2022-01-04T18:25:11Z;['Nils Pratley'];['Apple', 'Investing', 'Stock markets', 'Business', 'Computing', 'Technology', 'Airline industry'];The striking part about Apple’s $3tn valuation is that it does not look obviously wrong. Or, rather, it does not appear out of line with the racy values the US stock market places on technology companies. There is no need, for example, to engage in heroic horizon-gazing projections, as with $1.2tn Tesla, to support the enormous number. One can roughly get to $3tn at Apple via conventional yardsticks such as revenues, profits and cash generation. The company generated revenues of $366bn in its last financial year that ended in September – $1bn a day – and made profits of $94.7bn. So the shares are being rated at slightly more than 30 times last year’s earnings. That’s punchy, but not wildly so given the rate of revenue growth (one third last year) and the fact that all the profits find their way to investors these days, largely through share buy-backs. Meanwhile, the old scare story about “peak iPhone” has not materialised. Consumers do not seem deterred by increasingly incremental design improvements. The newer worry about regulatory threats also appears less than daunting. Apple is still clinging onto the princely rake-off fees that its app store extracts from developers, and challenges to the regime move at glacial speed. Apple also looks smarter than, say, Facebook in managing the politics. In any case, even if app store fees were slashed, such an outcome would not be game-changing given the frantic pace of growth in other elements of the “services” line – music, TV, cloud storage and so on. Within the tech universe, Apple is diversified. None of which guarantees that, having skipped lightly from a $1tn valuation to $3tn in less than four years, Apple will progress to $4tn just as smoothly. Higher interest rates (one of the big investment uncertainties for 2022) would seriously test the market’s love affair with tech. But $3tn is not currently ridiculous. Flights of fancy There’s nothing like a new year to bring forth optimistic investment thoughts about what might happen in the months ahead, and here come the airlines, reacting to a whiff of optimism about Omicron. On a lively first day of trading, BA owner IAG’s shares rose 11%, easyJet was 9% better and Wizz Air, which reported it carried almost three times as many passengers last month than in December 2020, gained 12%. All those stocks are highly leveraged to the Covid newsflow, so, yes, a bounce in share prices is reasonable if travel restrictions could be eased – if not this week, then soon. Versus a month ago, the Omicron picture for travel, holiday and hotel companies definitely looks less dreadful if infections may be about to peak. The timing could also be ideal: it would allow confidence to return in time for Easter, the first critical period for the short-haul market. That, at least, is one script and the one favoured by bullish analysts. It’s perfectly plausible, but the part of the recovery story that investors might worry about is airlines’ pricing power. As far as one can tell, they’re all planning to return capacity to 2019 levels as quickly as possible. That still feels a little dreamy unless prices are about to be slashed to whip up demand. Even on a gentler Covid outlook (which obviously isn’t guaranteed), one suspects the old profit margins will take a while to return.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/04/apples-3tn-valuation-is-not-as-ridiculous-as-it-seems;2
330;330;5577;5577;Benítez gets his man in Patterson but only wins can end Everton toxicity | Andy Hunter;2022-01-04T18:23:47Z;['Andy Hunter'];['Everton', 'Rafael Benítez', 'Rangers', 'Transfer window', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Everton have taken their January spend to about £29m with the signing of Nathan Patterson from Rangers. With it, they have addressed two key areas for Rafael Benítez and finally delivered the money in his second transfer window. With it, the club will rightly demand their manager finally delivers a return of his own. Patterson, a 20-year-old Scotland international, signed a five-and-a-half-year contract on Tuesday after Rangers accepted a deal worth about £11m. The right back was the subject of two failed Everton bids in the summer having been identified as a prime young target to challenge and ultimately succeed the 33-year-old Séamus Coleman, the selfless captain who continues to carry a substantial workload as well as heavy responsibility for a dysfunctional team.
“It was an easy choice to sign,” Patterson said. “This is a massive club with huge history and the fanbase is tremendous. Obviously we aren’t in the place where we want to be right now but we can definitely get there with the talent in the changing room and staff here, and I have full belief we can do that. It was also great for me knowing the manager really wanted me here and that made my decision. When a club really wants you, it makes your mind up early on. I wanted to come here from the very start.” Patterson’s arrival follows that of the Ukraine international Vitaliy Mykolenko, the 22-year-old left-back who cost an initial £17.9m from Dynamo Kyiv and was unveiled before the home defeat by Brighton on Sunday. Time to adapt to the first transfers of their professional lives represents a luxury in Everton’s predicament, and one the manager is unable to afford. Benítez wanted to strengthen both full-back positions and midfield this month, having spent £1.7m during his first window as Everton navigated Premier League profit and sustainability rules. He was unaware of just how tight the financial constraints would be when agreeing to become Farhad Moshiri’s fifth, and most controversial, permanent managerial appointment in June. Another necessary rebuild was delayed as big earners remained on the wage bill – until September in the case of £200,000-a-week James Rodríguez – and an extensive injury list that has included the outfield spine of the team has exposed the squad’s well-known limitations. The job, as Benítez has admitted, has been far harder than advertised or anticipated. Yet Goodison Park is not a toxic, disillusioned place (a strange mix, admittedly) that boos Salomón Rondón simply because Benítez once managed Liverpool and dismissed Everton as a small club. Moshiri’s appointment was divisive, disregarded supporters’ emotional connection to their club and guaranteed patience would evaporate at the first sign of trouble. But a crowd that afforded Benítez a rapturous reception before his debut in August has turned for the simple, time-honoured reasons of results and performances. Both have been dire and while there have been legitimate excuses for the downward spiral (that Benítez has seized upon too readily), the manager has presented his detractors with several open goals after an encouraging start.
Brighton on Sunday was the worst example so far. Everton had a clear fortnight to prepare because of three consecutive postponements and Dominic Calvert-Lewin back after a four-month absence. Yet Benítez’s switch to a wing-back system sowed confusion and his choice of Coleman over Lucas Digne on the left was a self-defeating act of stubbornness. A fallout over tactics is believed to be behind Digne’s ostracism, with the manager wanting the creative France international to concentrate on his defending, although other, more basic factors may be at play. Digne is a sellable asset at a club that has few. And Benítez likes a tall full-back. At 5ft 10in and 6ft 1in respectively, Mykolenko and Patterson may not be mountainous but they bring more height to a weak backline than 5ft 9in Digne and 5ft 8in Coleman. Everton head to Hull in the FA Cup on Saturday on the back of a dreadful run of eight defeats and one win from their past 11 Premier League games. A return of 19 points from 18 league games is the club’s lowest haul since 2005-06. On previous form Moshiri would have been expected to sack his manager by now. Instead he has backed him, and at considerable cost given Everton’s finances and the impact of the pandemic on the entire industry. Benítez needs to unearth evidence for the strong second half to the season that he has repeatedly promised, and quickly.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/rafael-benitez-nathan-patterson-wins-everton-toxicity;4
331;331;5578;5578;Mary Fraser obituary;2022-01-04T18:22:04Z;['N/A'];['Teaching', 'Refugees'];My aunt Mary Fraser, who has died aged 91, was head of the Inner London Education Authority’s visionary Unified Language Service (ULS) from the late 1960s until its abolition in 1990, helping to shape the teaching of English as a second language to immigrant and refugee children. During her time at the ULS Mary championed the idea of teaching English to newly arrived pupils by integrating them into mainstream classrooms – a more inclusive approach that helped to change attitudes as well as policy within state education at a time when students were separated according to their different abilities. Under her direction, the ULS also fought to include the traditions, politics and histories of its new students’ home countries within an Anglocentric syllabus. Mary was born in Edgbaston, Birmingham, to Hilda (nee Walker) and her husband, Fred Fraser, a sales rep at a watch and clock making company. She went to Cheltenham Ladies college before going on to Westfield College (now Queen Mary University of London), from which she graduated in 1951 in French and Italian. Her career teaching English as a foreign language began with the British Council in Sweden and Brazil, and in the late 60s she was selected to lead the ULS, which expanded under her leadership from its first office in Islington’s Centre for Urban Education Studies to have bases in 12 London boroughs. Throughout her career and time at the ULS she continued to teach abroad during school holidays in countries such as Syria, Nigeria, and again Brazil. The abolition of the ILEA prompted Mary to take early retirement, but she continued teaching in other ways, including via a long association with a group of Eritrean child refugees whom she had met in south London not long after their arrival in the UK. Initially teaching them English, she also acted as a mentor throughout their school years until their first jobs, developing a form of extended family relationship and lifelong friendships. In later years Mary researched and led history walks around London with the University of the Third Age and its Shape of London architectural group. She also pursued her longstanding love of chamber music, often attending as many as three concerts a week. Mary was a generous, kind and fearless spirit who showed exemplary dedication to the communities that she was part of. She remained sharp and active to the end of her life. She is survived by her sister Jean, me, and a cousin, Anthony.;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/04/mary-fraser-obituary;6
332;332;5579;5579;Heart attack patients told to make own way to hospital as Covid surge hits northern England;2022-01-04T18:17:37Z;['Andrew Gregory'];['Coronavirus', 'Health', 'North of England', 'Hospitals', 'NHS', 'UK news', 'Lancashire', 'Yorkshire'];"Heart attack patients calling 999 in parts of northern England are being asked to get a lift instead of waiting for an ambulance as hospitals in the region experience more than double the growth rate in numbers of Covid patients compared with London. Four more NHS trusts in England – all outside London – declared “critical incidents” on Tuesday amid soaring staff absences, rising numbers of Covid patients and growing pressure on emergency services.
There is cautious optimism that cases and hospitalisations in the capital – which was the centre of the Omicron variant outbreak - are beginning to level off. However, hospitals at the other end of the country are experiencing the fastest growth in Covid occupancy, according to an analysis of official NHS data by the Guardian. The highest rate of growth in England is in the north-east and Yorkshire, where the number of Covid patients in hospitals has more than doubled – up 122% - in one week. There were 1,975 Covid patients in hospitals on Monday, compared with fewer than half that – 889 – the week before. NHS pressures in the north-east have become so intense that ambulance workers in the area have begun asking patients with suspected heart attacks and strokes to get a lift to hospital with family or friends instead of waiting for an ambulance, amid high staff absences and an “unprecedented” surge in demand, it emerged on Tuesday. An internal note at North East ambulance service NHS foundation trust said that where there was likely to be a risk from the delay in an ambulance reaching a patient, call handlers should “consider asking the patient to be transported by friends or family”, the Health Service Journal reported. The second-fastest growth rate in hospital Covid occupancy is in the north-west, which recorded a rise of 94% in the last seven days. It means all parts of northern England have more than double the growth rate experienced in London, which was 46% between 27 December and 3 January. The number of Covid patients in hospitals in the Midlands has risen 74% in the last seven days, with Covid occupancy up 58% in the south-east, 55% in the east and 43% in the south-west.
Overall, the daily count of confirmed Covid-19 patients in hospital in England has increased by 68% in the last week, according to the analysis. There were 14,210 patients on Monday, compared with 8,474 a week ago. This remains significantly below the 34,336 peak of 18 January 2021. However, health leaders said in some parts of the NHS, Covid staff absences and the backlog of non-Covid care were having a worse impact this winter than last year, meaning the steep rises in Covid occupancy were still causing major challenges. The deepening crisis in hospitals was highlighted further on Tuesday when it emerged four more NHS trusts had declaredcritical incidents amid staff absences and soaring demand for care. The Guardian revealed on Monday that at least six NHS trusts in England had declared such incidents, which are announced when trusts believe they may no longer be able to provide a range of critical services. Declaring an incident enables local health chiefs to call for help from staff and other organisations, and creates a formal interim emergency governance structure to make prioritisation decisions at speed, for example redeploying staff or reprioritising services. On Tuesday, University hospitals Plymouth NHS trust, Great Western hospitals NHS foundation trust, Blackpool teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust and University hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS foundation trust all confirmed they had also declared critical incidents. Trish Armstrong-Child, the chief executive of Blackpool teaching hospitals, said an “internal critical incident” was declared due to “operational challenges across the organisation”. These included Blackpool Victoria hospital running at “full capacity”, long waits in A&E, and “high staff sickness absence levels of above 10%”. Outbreaks of Covid in Blackpool had also resulted in more people being admitted to the hospital each day than the number being discharged. Acknowledging that the north of England could experience even more pressure on hospitals in the coming weeks, Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, the director of public health for Lancashire county council, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the county was at “the foothills” of an Omicron wave. He said: “Lancashire is beginning to experience what London did at the beginning of last month and, of course, London is better resourced and the infrastructures are well organised compared to other regions, so we are bracing ourselves for a tsunami of Omicron cases in Lancashire. “But this is all meaning that we are not able to concentrate on the non-Covid issues, that’s really needing to be addressed immediately as well, so it’s a double challenge we face: not only fighting Covid but all the other pent-up demand and need due to non-Covid issues.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/growth-rate-covid-patients-north-more-than-double-london;7
333;333;5580;5580;Why are people so delighted at the downfall of Elizabeth Holmes? | Emma Brockes;2022-01-04T18:17:05Z;['Emma Brockes'];['Theranos', 'Law (US)', 'World news'];"Ten minutes prior to the announcement of the verdict in the Elizabeth Holmes trial on Monday, reporters in San Jose, California, tweeted a heads up that the jury had returned. The news hit Twitter like oil on a hot frying pan, triggering not only anticipation, but a frisson of spite. Holmes, whose outfits over the course of the 15-week trial – dowdy, pale, and unthreatening – were interpreted as a contrivance equal to the black turtlenecks before them, isn’t a sympathetic figure, and there is always satisfaction to seeing confidence tricksters called out. But the level of enjoyment in her ruin, it seems to me, falls outside the normal range. “Ha,” I thought childishly when the guilty verdict came in. “Serves her right.” This was a particular and not wholly flattering form of schadenfreude. Holmes was found guilty of defrauding her investors on four counts; she was found not guilty on four counts relating to defrauding patients; and the jury couldn’t reach a verdict on three further counts. In all likelihood she will go to jail, and the sheer size of the numbers involved – Holmes defrauded investors to the tune of almost $1bn – will affect the length of her sentence. None of which quite explains the scale of contempt for the woman. I can’t summon a particular face or any real antipathy towards the board members of Enron. I loathe the architects of the 2008 financial crisis in a vague way that has never attached to a single image. Here is Holmes, however, with her too-red lipstick and wispy hair; and up it comes, a violent surge of dislike.
Obviously there are sexist biases involved, which knowing them to be such does little to neutralise. The woman thing aside, however, it’s clear that in the popular imagination, Holmes is carrying the can for a lot of unpunished hubris. Jeff Bezos with his ludicrous space hobby; ditto Elon Musk, with his mad tweets and – if we’re going to bring hair into it – ludicrous solution to baldness. If Holmes did something shady to investors, her greater crime was being part of a wealth class that has separated itself from the rest of humanity. It makes you wonder about Leonardo da Vinci – were people sitting around the coffee shops of early 16th-century Florence, bitching about what a big-headed arsehole he was and hoping for his imminent demise? Did we feel this way when Martha Stewart went down? One could write the whole thing all off as class envy were it not linked to some deeper dismay at the world into which we have apparently sleepwalked, one in which the grifters and influencers of Silicon Valley have come to inherit the Earth. Most of them appear to be bomb proof. Liars and plagiarists can lay low for a few years, before popping up to start peddling baloney again. What makes it worse is that, for the space of a few years, many of us willingly drank the Kool-Aid. Facebook allowed us to keep in touch with far-flung friends and family. Social media democratised marginalised voices. Getting a taxi was easier than it had ever been. All these things may be true, but they are not the whole truth, particularly at this time of year when one is encouraged to take stock and remind oneself, sternly, that happiness is sitting on a rock reading a book, or learning to play the harp. Instead, here we go again, passed out on the sofa not merely scrolling, but hate-scrolling. Which brings us to Elizabeth Holmes. What happened at Theranos, the creation of a phoney blood-testing technology, was not a “victimless crime”, but the victims, according to the court, were a plucky group of venture capitalists that it’s safe to say no one will be rustling up a quick crowdfunding campaign for. Regarded in a different light, and overlooking the patients for whom this technology was intended, Holmes almost did us a favour, exposing the credulousness of a system intent only on profit. But that’s not how it landed. The story had nothing to do with me, I thought, not for the first time, but there it was; a thrill of satisfaction when the verdict came through, that was only vaguely related to justice.

334;334;5581;5581;‘Ruined the experience for me’: mother’s story of breastfeeding voyeurism;2022-01-04T18:16:45Z;['Rachel Hall'];['Breastfeeding', 'UK news', 'Women', 'Law', 'UK criminal justice'];When Julia Cooper had her first child, she decided to breastfeed so that she could take her out on long walks through nature, one of her favourite hobbies. But that suddenly changed when she spotted a man pointing a long lens camera towards her as she breastfed her baby daughter on a park bench in Greater Manchester. After twisting her baby out of view, feeling unnerved, and noticing he continued to stare, she approached the man to ask him whether he was taking photos of her. He replied that he had the right to do so, since they were in a public park. “I was just so shocked and turned away with my baby so he couldn’t get any more photos, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it – it was really bothering me,” Cooper said. Still rattled that evening, she called Greater Manchester police. Although sympathetic to her distress, they said there was no law against breastfeeding voyeurism, and as a result they were unable to help. But for Cooper the incident transformed her life. She no longer felt able to take her daughter out for long stretches of time, and would hide in her car whenever she needed to breastfeed her daughter. “I was left feeling so disgusted, disturbed and angry that this man had got away with taking photos of me and my daughter,” she said. “I only tried breastfeeding once in public again, and it just ruined the experience for me. I was looking at everybody around thinking: are they going to photograph me.” Distraught by the lack of action, Cooper turned to her MP, Jeff Smith, for help. Together with Stella Creasy, one of the few MPs who is a young mother and who has experienced breastfeeding voyeurism herself, he launched a campaign under the slogan Stop the Breast Pest, which has resulted in the creation of a new offence of breastfeeding voyeurism, which is being put before parliament on Tuesday. Cooper said the proposed new law would provide much-needed reassurance to mothers such as herself that “you can breastfeed in peace”. Creasy’s own experience of breastfeeding voyeurism took place on an overground train in London, when she noticed that a boy seated opposite her was filming her breastfeeding her baby. “You’re sat on the train and you think: what’s that person opposite doing? Then you realise with horror, you suddenly think: Oh my god, can you see anything? I just wanted to get out, I felt embarrassed, I felt humiliated and I wanted to get away,” she said. Creasy said that since the incident she had spoken to many young mothers who had shared similar experiences, and she thinks this may be connected with the UK’s comparatively low rates of breastfeeding. But she is pleased to now be able to tell them that “if you get breast pests in future they will be held to account”. “We need to make sure that mums know they can complain and that police forces should act,” she said. Women who spoke to campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed described their experiences of being stared at, filmed and photographed while breastfeeding. One recalled how a man had asked her: “Is it my turn next?” as she breastfed her three-month-old child. “I can imagine many women are anxious about breastfeeding in public and drawing attention to themselves at the best of times, but something like that could really put them off,” she said. Others described feeling unnerved by sustained eye contact for up to 10 minutes. One said the person “kept shifting to get a better look” and held her gaze when she tried to shame him into looking away, while another said she had felt so uncomfortable she had called her husband to collect her.;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/breastfeeding-voyeurism-mothers-story;5

John Sillett, 55, faces three charges of rape, four counts of assault by penetration and two sexual assaults. The alleged assaults against the same girl started when she was aged between 12 and 13, Winchester crown court was told by a prosecutor. Sillett, of Farley Hill, Wokingham, trained riders for the 2016 Rio Olympics and was based at the Wellington Riding Centre on the Duke of Wellington’s estate in Hook, Hampshire. He denies the charges. Kerry Maylin, prosecuting, said the alleged attacks began with Sillett groping the girl, before he raped and sexually assaulted her on several other occasions. She said that after the first alleged assault, the alleged victim confronted Sillett. Maylin added: “His response to that little girl was ‘I am sorry, do not tell anyone’. She didn’t and life moved on.” The alleged victim said in a video interview, which was shown to the court: “I was so scared, I didn’t want to move, I didn’t know what to do.” The prosecutor said that on another occasion: “Mr Sillett started to touch her, he took off her dressing gown, he touched her chest. He told her: ‘You know what you want, you know you want this’. She said: ‘No’ and ‘Why are you doing this to me?’. He took off his own underwear and then he raped her. No protection was used.” The alleged victim said in the video interview: “He just started touching me. I was so confused at what was going on: ‘Why are you doing this to me, what have I done that you think you can do this to me?’ He just took it further.” The trial continues.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/former-olympic-showjumping-coach-john-sillett-raped-girl-court-told;5
336;336;5583;5583;Transfer news: Napoli’s Insigne to join Toronto, Watford sign left-back Kamara;2022-01-04T18:07:05Z;['Fabrizio Romano', 'Luke McLaughlin'];['Toronto FC', 'Napoli', 'Football', 'MLS', 'Serie A', 'European club football', 'Sport', 'US sports', 'Transfer window'];"The Napoli and Italy forward, Lorenzo Insigne, has agreed a deal to join the MLS club Toronto FC this summer. The 30-year-old has been given a five-and-a-half year contract with the Canadian club, ending in December 2027, and is set to join them as a free agent when his Napoli contract expires at the end of this season.
The deal is said to include a basic wage of €11m a season, with another €5m in potential add-ons, and will be signed and officially announced this week. Capturing Insigne is a huge coup for Toronto, who finished second-bottom of the MLS Eastern Conference last season, with just six wins from 34 matches. Having been on the books at the Italian club since 2006, Insigne made his first-team debut in 2010 and has become a mainstay of Napoli’s attack alongside Dries Mertens, making 264 Serie A appearances and scoring 89 league goals. He was made club captain following Marek Hamsik’s departure in 2019 and his own exit from the club is sure to disappoint many fans of the Partenopei.
Insigne was also a key member of Roberto Mancini’s side that triumphed at Euro 2020, scoring two goals, including a spectacular winner against Belgium in the quarter-finals. He is not the first high-profile Italy international to opt for a spell in the MLS, following in the footsteps of players such as Andrea Pirlo and Alessandro Nesta.
Elsewhere in Italy, the Ajax and Cameroon international goalkeeper, André Onana, is poised to sign for the Serie A champions Internazionale. The 25-year-old, who was on Barcelona’s books between 2010 and 2015, has passed a medical and will move to Italy in the summer as a free agent. In the Premier League, Watford have completed a move for Ivorian international left-back Hassane Kamara, who joins on a two-and-a-half year deal. The 27-year-old, who has signed from Ligue 1 side Nice, will reportedly cost the Hornets £4m. Claudio Ranieri’s side are also set to seal a move for Udinese centre-back Samir. Congolese midfielder Edo Kayembe and veteran Croatian defender Domagoj Vida will also join imminently, according to local reports. Meanwhile, Watford have allowed Ismaïla Sarr to join up with the Senegal squad for the Africa Cup of Nations after initially ruling that the player was still recovering from a knee ligament injury. Everton have confirmed the signing of the Scotland international defender Nathan Patterson from Rangers. The 20-year-old moves to the Premier League for an initial £12m, with a deal lasting until 2027.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/transfer-news-napoli-captain-insigne-to-join-toronto-after-agreeing-11m-salary;4
337;337;5584;5584;Giles calls for systemic change in English cricket after Ashes defeat;2022-01-04T18:00:18Z;['Ali Martin'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'Ashley Giles', 'England cricket team', 'Australia cricket team', 'The Ashes', 'Cricket', 'Australia sport', 'Sport'];"Ashley Giles has apologised for England’s failed Ashes campaign but warned that sacking the coach, the captain or even himself as the director of men’s cricket will change little unless the entire game addresses its systemic shortcomings.
Recently arrived in Sydney, Giles is compiling a report into a series England trail 3-0 against Australia going into the fourth Test. He held off from addressing the futures of Chris Silverwood, the head coach who is isolating with Covid-19, and Joe Root, the captain, given the final result of the series remains outstanding. Nevertheless, the 48-year-old stressed broader issues than just personnel or tactical missteps were at play for a Test record in 2021 of four wins, two draws and nine losses. Giles cited the pandemic, fixture congestion and the numbing effects of bubble life, plus quality opposition and a struggle to bridge the gap between county cricket and the top level. “I absolutely feel the responsibility of losing this Ashes series,” Giles said. “We all do and we can only apologise. I know there will be a lot of emotion, a lot of anger about how we’ve lost it. But we know it’s not an easy place to come. In the last 34 years we’ve come here and won once [in 2010-11]. “We’ve not done well in terms of results. In the 1990s [a similar record] was accepted as normal for England leaderships and they got away with it. We set our standards much higher than that.” Pressed on this, given English cricket is second only to India in terms of resources, he replied: “That’s what we’re aiming for. But unless we look at more systemic change, a collective responsibility and collective solutions, we can make whatever changes we want – you can change me, the head coach, the captain – but we’re only setting up future leaders for failure. That’s all we’re doing. We’re only pushing it down the road.”
Giles said his review will look into why players do not appear to improve in the current Test setup. While this did not sound overly promising for Silverwood, who he appointed in 2019, a strong first 14 months that featured away wins in South Africa and Sri Lanka, and included West Indies and Pakistan being beaten at home, was noted. But in the last year when England – now ranked fourth – faced the top three sides in India, New Zealand and Australia the gulf became evident. A selection whirlpool was amplified by rest periods afforded to players during the 3-1 away defeat in India, and bled into the summer; those handed breaks still played in the Indian Premier League that followed, before going on to miss the 1-0 home defeat by New Zealand. Though 12-month central contracts seem to only mean 10 in practice, Giles had no regrets about trying to manage the draining effects of biosecure bubbles while fulfilling England’s fixtures. Test matches would still have been missed, he insisted, even if given full priority over the T20 World Cup that preceded the Ashes. “The last two years have probably been the most challenging of my career,” Giles said. “Performance has almost been the last thing we’ve had to think about. And that’s a really sad situation. But have we got the game on? Have we tried to keep the players fit and well? Yes, we’ve tried. And the wellbeing issue is a massive one.” England’s 21 Tests since the start of the pandemic is three times that of Australia but, though calling the pile‑up “horrendous”, Giles stressed he had no input into a schedule decided at board level. A three-Test tour of the Caribbean in March will still require restricted environments and Covid-19 testing regimes, with a foreboding “I think the guys are at their very top limit of dealing with that” added here.
It was Giles who handed the job of picking squads to Silverwood when removing Ed Smith and dissolving the national selector role last summer but he remains defiant on the principle. There were few obvious omissions who would have made any difference in Australia, he said, even if the selection of XIs is another issue he will explore. Giles also raised the rain-affected warm-up period and, like many, put the failed tour primarily down to the standard of English batting. On the dearth of Test-quality players here, as well as proven spinners or seamers quicker than 87mph (Mark Wood and the injured Jofra Archer aside), he pointed to the domestic system as a whole. “If that’s a failing of this leadership, that’s been a failing of many leaderships before us,” Giles said. “Are we creating [domestic] conditions that will allow us to better prepare our cricketers for playing in the conditions out here? I’m not sure we are at the moment. “What we play, when we play, on what [pitches] we play – that’s a collective responsibility. It’s up to us as ECB but also a conversation to have with the counties.” Giles will submit his final report to the England and Wales Cricket Board, which has grappled with a racism crisis in the past year and appears itself to be suffering from a leadership vacuum given Tom Harrison’s expected departure this year and no chair in place. There is also a lack of cricket experience here too, with Giles’s predecessor, Andrew Strauss, the only former men’s Test player in the room – and he is an adviser with no vote.
“In terms of my position, that’s not for me to decide,” Giles said. “You can clearly tell by the way that I’m talking that I’m thinking very much about the future and how we take this team forward.” When Giles enhanced Silverwood’s role last April he said “his head is on the block” and “if we lose in Australia, the pressure is on all of us”. The review has begun and the solutions will apparently follow but that scenario has certainly come to pass.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/04/giles-calls-for-systemic-change-in-english-cricket-after-ashes-defeat;1
338;338;5585;5585;Keir Starmer must reclaim patriotism for the left | Letters;2022-01-04T17:58:40Z;['N/A'];['Labour', 'Keir Starmer', 'Politics', 'Conservatives', 'UK news', 'Scottish politics', 'Welsh politics', 'Plaid Cymru', 'Priti Patel'];"Andy Beckett points out the risks in Keir Starmer’s talk of “the national interest” (Is Keir Starmer’s professed patriotism a strength or a weakness?, 31 December). He acknowledges that Clement Attlee successfully rode his patriotism to electoral success in 1945. But where Attlee’s patriotism seemed a genuine conviction, there’s been an expediency to Labour leaders draping themselves in the union flag lately. It comes across as a panicky reaction to bad opinion polls rather than a genuine love of country. The British public can sense this disingenuousness and they don’t take kindly to it. Where the left falls down is that, in its rush to be ostentatiously progressive, it has abandoned the field of patriotism and allowed it to be churned up and rehashed in the shape of a slightly nasty nativism à la Priti Patel. Unless Labour actively makes a different case, though, rather than simply playing dress-up, Starmer can scream until he’s red, white and blue in the face. Nobody will take him seriously so long as the only vision of patriotism is the one presented by the send-them-back brigade of Tory ministers, because they might as well vote for the people who really believe it. There is hope for Labour yet; Starmer can still seize the initiative. He should stake the progressive left claim to patriotism, pointing out that Britain at its best is so much better than the parochial, them-and-us fortress of Tory hard-right dreams. This is the Britain that millions from different parts of the world have come to call home, the Britain that (even now) has a genuine claim to be a world leader in international aid, the Britain of vaccine pioneers, of community volunteers, of villages opening up their homes to refugees. Labour has so far missed a trick in not associating these things with what the UK can be as a nation. If it does so, Labour can start to redefine patriotism and reconquer the ground it abandoned to the Tories. Dr Hamid Khan London • In a good article, Andy Beckett refers on several occasions to Starmer’s patriotism. However, to which country or state is that patriotism attached? The article has a photograph of Starmer wearing an England football top. In less than 20 years, Labour has fallen from the majority party in Scotland to a single Westminster seat. Labour has never organised in Northern Ireland, where the “patriotic” parties are all unionists, whose preference is the Tories. In Wales, although Labour has most Westminster seats, it is in power in the Senedd due to a deal with Plaid Cymru and increasingly stresses its Welshness. So, Starmer’s patriotism seems to be an English nationalist patriotism. Increasingly, people in the four countries identify as English, Irish, Scots or Welsh, rather than British. But Labour has for decades been scared of saying what Englishness/Britishness connotes other than the royal family, the imperial history, war and the union flag. As far as the section of the public to whom these things matter are concerned, the Tories and parties further right do these things more convincingly. So, I think Mr Starmer will be “one of Labour’s patriotic failures”. Alasdair Macdonald Glasgow • If Keir Starmer listened to Nesrine Malik (For Labour and the Conservatives, racism is really all about reputation management, 2 January) or, better still, asked her to be his chief adviser, Labour would reap the reward for being a party of principle, integrity and courage – a party I might once again be proud to be a member of.

While I personally have not engaged in direct disruptive action, I can see why some feel that they need to do more. The media, by and large, take no notice of polite expressions of concern. Even marches in the hundreds of thousands are regularly ignored. It is widely believed that only more extreme action attracts news coverage. Might not progressive and socially responsible media such as the Guardian help here, by reporting, in a timely manner, more of the peaceful demonstrations by thoughtful people of their concerns about the green agenda, human rights, responsible politics etc? It would be good to know that extreme action is not (in the minds of some) excusable, because the views of concerned citizens will be reported without recourse first to potentially perilous or illegal behaviours. If the new intended legislation on demonstrations comes into force, the onus will lie even more on media outlets to report widely held green, social and ethical concerns in ways that do not require a minority of worried citizens to put themselves and/or others at risk. Journalistic commentary on threats to our planet, politics and human rights is always welcome, but surely not all valid concerns need to become risky, action-packed drama before they can become reportable as news?

The Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 was negotiated and supported by the British government and an Irish delegation led by Arthur Griffith, the founder of the original Sinn Féin party of 1905. Following intense debate, the treaty was passed in the Irish parliament (Dáil Éireann) in January 1922 to establish the Irish Free State. In the June 1922 general election, almost 80% of votes cast were for pro-treaty candidates. The successful pro-treaty Sinn Féin party elected WT Cosgrave as president of the Irish Free State and the party changed its name to Cumann na nGaedheal (Association of the Irish), the precursor to today’s Fine Gael (Family of the Irish). Most of anti-treaty Sinn Féin were led by Éamon de Valera to become today’s Fianna Fáil. The small remaining rump of Sinn Féin maintained a policy of abstentionism to the Irish parliament, leading to a split in 1970 – those wishing to take their seats became Official Sinn Féin, and then the Workers’ party. Those wishing to maintain abstentionism called themselves Provisional Sinn Féin, which included a young Gerry Adams. By 1986, the Adams wing ended its policy of abstentionism and adopted a shorter name that no other party was using: Sinn Féin.

343;343;5590;5590;100,000 key workers in England told to take Covid test every working day;2022-01-04T17:55:44Z;['Peter Walker'];['Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'England', 'Boris Johnson'];"About 100,000 workers in key industries in England will be told to take Covid tests on every working day to catch infections early and avoid the virus spreading to colleagues, Boris Johnson has said. As UK confirmed cases rose to a new record of nearly 219,000, the prime minister acknowledged the NHS was now on a “war footing” – but insisted there was no need for tighter restrictions in England. “We have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country again. But the weeks ahead are going to be challenging,” he said. Speaking at the first Downing Street Covid press conference of 2022, Johnson said lateral flow tests – which have been in short supply for many in recent weeks – would be sent directly to workplaces for “critical national services” including food, transport and border staff. All key workers in these industries in England would be asked to test themselves every work day. Measures such as tests for key workers would help the country “find a way to live with this virus”, despite the very rapid spread of the Omicron variant, he said. It came after confirmed daily Covid cases in the UK hit another record high, with 218,724 reported in the past 24 hours. “Anyone who thinks our battle with Covid is over is, I’m afraid, profoundly wrong,” Johnson said, referring to the total. “This is a moment for the utmost caution.” Johnson said the government would continue in England with its plan B counter-measures, covering mask use in shops and on public transport, a guide to work from home where possible, and some use of vaccine passports. The public had “responded and changed their behaviour”, Johnson said, meaning the new regime had helped.
The prime minister urged people to get booster vaccinations, saying that in the coming weeks it would “increasingly become the norm” for other countries to require these for entry. Asked whether he was confident there would be no need for further restrictions, Johnson said that while he was hopeful this would be the case, this depended on “whether the virus behaves in the way that perhaps it has behaved in South Africa”, where Omicron was first identified and where it has appeared less severe. Answering the same question, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said that while Omicron had so far mainly affected younger people, it was now “moving up the age range”, meaning matters could change. Sir Chris Witty, England’s chief medical officer, said that while Omicron was expected to cause fewer people to need intensive care treatment, the NHS still faced “very substantial pressure” on its services, exacerbated by staff absences.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/100000-key-workers-in-england-told-to-take-covid-test-every-working-day;7
344;344;5591;5591;Prince Andrew’s lawyers fight to dismiss Virginia Giuffre lawsuit in court;2022-01-04T17:55:44Z;['Victoria Bekiempis'];['Prince Andrew', 'Jeffrey Epstein', 'New York', 'US news'];"Lawyers for Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre, who has long accused the royal of sexual abuse, faced off in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, in his attempt to dismiss her civil lawsuit.
The arguments via videoconference came a day after the unsealing of a 2009 settlement between Giuffre and the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The judge, Lewis Kaplan, questioned lawyers for Andrew closely over their claim that the settlement means Giuffre’s lawsuit should be dismissed. He also promised “a decision pretty soon”. Giuffre, who accused Epstein and his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell of sexual abuse and forcing her into sex with Prince Andrew at age 17 – an accusation he vehemently denies – received $500,000 in her settlement with the late financier. Using Giuffre’s maiden name, the settlement contains a provision releasing “second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant … from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia Roberts, including state or federal, cause and causes of action”. Andrew, who is not mentioned in the settlement, has contended that this clause bars Giuffre from suing him. On Tuesday morning, reporters missed up to 15 minutes of arguments. A teleconference number only provided audio at 10.15am, after proceedings began. The judge, Lewis Kaplan, asked Andrew’s lawyer, Andrew Brad Brettler: “What is a ‘potential defendant’?” Brettler said: “A potential defendant is someone who could have been named in this lawsuit but was not. Prince Andrew could have been sued in the 2009 Florida action. He was not. Therefore, he was a potential defendant and releasee.” Later, Brettler said: “I don’t even understand how there could be any question as to whether ‘other potential defendants’ had a meaning. Clearly, Ms Giuffre intended to release a broad category of individuals including royalty, including businessmen.” Brettler also said Epstein “would never want to have to be dragged into a lawsuit were she to sue Prince Andrew later”. Kaplan responded: “We don’t have Mr Epstein here to say that’s in fact what his view was.” The judge also said Epstein might have wanted to grant the broadest release possible, or might have intended to provide the narrowest release possible. He also questioned how enforceability could apply to other parties if they didn’t know about the agreement, which included a confidentiality provision. “Arguably,” he said, “it would be that Epstein and Giuffre had an agreement between themselves that there was a release to other potential defendants, whatever that means, but they weren’t to know about it”. Apparently speaking rhetorically, the judge added: “The only people who could enforce it were Epstein and Giuffre.” Epstein, who also counted former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among influential associates, killed himself in custody in New York in 2019. Maxwell, 60, was convicted on sex trafficking charges last month. Her lawyers have said they will appeal. Andrew has been dogged by his links to Epstein and Maxwell and by the Giuffre suit. On Tuesday, Brettler reiterated what was said in a 29 October court filing. “Giuffre settled her sex-trafficking and sexual-abuse claims against Epstein in 2009,” the filing said. In doing so, she provided Epstein with a general release of all claims against him and numerous other individuals and entities. “To avoid being dragged into future legal disputes, Epstein negotiated for this broad release, insisting that it cover any and all persons who Giuffre identified as potential targets of future lawsuits, regardless of the merit – or lack thereof – to any such claims.” That filing also said: “Because Prince Andrew is a senior member of the British royal family, he falls into one of the expressly identified categories of persons, ie, royalty, released from liability under the release agreement, along with politicians, academicians, businessmen and others allegedly associated with Epstein. “As a third-party beneficiary of the release agreement, Prince Andrew is entitled to enforce the general release contained therein.” David Boies, appearing for Giuffre, argued that the parties on the agreement could handle their agreement as they jointly wished, “at least so long as the third party has not reasonably relied to their detriment on what they have promised”. Boies also said there was no “reasonable” evidence Andrew knew about the agreement before being sued by Giuffre. As part of the litigation, Giuffre’s lawyers have requested documents including proof of Andrew’s now famous claim that he cannot sweat. Giuffre has alleged that the prince was “sweating profusely all over me” at a London nightclub on an evening when, she claims, they had sex.
Andrew told the BBC that could not be true, saying: “I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time.” He also said that on the night cited by Giuffre, he brought his daughter Beatrice to a late-afternoon children’s party at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking, Surrey. The prince says he was then at home with his children all night. Oral arguments in the attempt to dismiss Giuffre’s case took place amid sustained and damaging fallout over Andrew’s links to Maxwell and Epstein. Maxwell, the daughter of the late British press baron Robert Maxwell, was convicted on five counts for luring girls as young as 14 into Epstein’s orbit for him to sexually abuse. At the end of the proceeding on Tuesday, Kaplan told lawyers: “You’ll have a decision pretty soon.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-lawsuit-arguments;5
345;345;5592;5592;Bobby Rush, only politician to win against Obama, to retire from Congress;2022-01-04T17:55:28Z;['Martin Pengelly'];['US Congress', 'Democrats', 'Illinois', 'Barack Obama', 'US politics', 'US news'];"The only politician ever to beat Barack Obama will retire from the US Congress at the end of the year.
Bobby Rush, a Democratic representative from Illinois, faced Obama in a House primary in 2000 – and beat him by more than 30 points. Obama went on to win a US Senate seat in 2004 and become America’s first Black president five years later. Rush said Obama, then 38, “was blinded by his ambition” and moved too soon, against the wrong target. Obama said he had his “rear end handed to me”. Rush, 75 and first elected to Congress in 1992, is a minister and social activist who co-founded the Illinois Black Panther party and was described by Politico on Monday as “a legend in Chicago politics”. In a video, he said: “I have been reassigned. Actually, I’m not retiring, I’m returning home. I’m returning to my church. I’m returning to my family. I have grandchildren. I’m returning to my passion. “I will be in public life. I will be working hand in hand with someone who will replace me.” Rush’s district is solidly Democratic but political rune-readers still found worrying signs for the national party. Rush is the 24th Democrat to announce that they will not run in 2022. Only 11 Republicans have said the same. Two of those, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, voted to impeach Donald Trump over the Capitol riot and subsequently concluded they had no place in a party he dominates. Republicans are favored to take back the House in November – despite their supporters having physically attacked it, in an attempt to overturn the presidential election, on 6 January last year. Rush made headlines during his time in Congress. In 2012, after the shooting death in Florida of the Black teenager Trayvon Martin, he showed solidarity by wearing a hooded sweatshirt on the House floor. “Racial profiling has to stop,” he said. “Just because someone wears a hoodie does not make them a hoodlum.” It earned Rush a reprimand for violating rules regarding wearing hats in the chamber. Martin’s father, Tracy Martin, praised Rush and told the Washington Post: “This is something that needs to be talked about … This is a country of freedom of speech.”
Rush could raise eyebrows with sharp comments, as when he dismissed an anti-violence plan by an Illinois Republican senator, Mark Kirk, as a simplistic “white boy” solution to a complex problem.
He also pushed legislation designating lynching as a hate crime, named for Emmett Till, a Black Chicago teen whose killing in 1955 fueled the civil rights movement. Born in Georgia, Rush served in the US army and became involved in civil rights campaigning. In 1969, he was arrested and convicted on a weapons charge. In his video on Tuesday, he said: “My faith tells me that there’s a reason I’m still here. By all rights, I should have been murdered on 5 December 1969, the day after the police assassinated [the Black Panthers leader] Fred Hampton. “They came for me the next day, shot down my door, but by the grace of God my family and I were not home.” Elected as a Chicago alderman, he made an unsuccessful bid for mayor before entering Congress. Just before the 2000 primary against Obama, one of Rush’s sons was shot dead. Rush subsequently focused on gun control. He is also a cancer survivor. “I am not leaving the battlefield,” he said. “I am going to be an activist as long as I’m here in the land of the living, and I will be making my voice heard in the public realm – from the pulpit, in the community, and in the halls of power.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/bobby-rush-retire-congress;1
346;346;5593;5593;Breastfeeding voyeurs targeted by new proposed offence in England and Wales;2022-01-04T17:50:35Z;['Rajeev Syal', 'Rachel Hall'];['Law', 'Breastfeeding', 'Domestic violence', 'UK criminal justice', 'UK news', 'Women'];"Voyeurs who record images of breastfeeding women without permission and domestic abusers who escape jail because of time limits on prosecutions are being targeted by proposals put before parliament on Tuesday. A new offence of breastfeeding voyeurism, with a maximum sentence of two years, has been included by the Ministry of Justice in an amendment to the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. It follows a campaign led by Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, who was photographed while feeding her four-month-old baby daughter on a train in north London. She has been working with Jeff Smith, the Labour MP for Manchester Withington, on a campaign under the slogan Stop the Breast Pest. Creasy told the Guardian last year she was breastfeeding on a train when she noticed a teenage boy laughing and taking pictures. “He had his phone out and I thought he was playing with his phone, and then I realised with horror that he was taking photos,” she said. “You feel exposed. I don’t think he can have got very much of a picture, but the sheer horror at the point when you’re focused on trying to support your newborn baby … and somebody is doing that, it was vile. Because I felt quite vulnerable, I just got off my train as soon as I could.” The new offence of breastfeeding voyeurism, which would apply in England and Wales, is one of two new amendments to the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. There will be a two-year maximum sentence for those caught and prosecuted. Under a separate amendment, victims of domestic abuse will be allowed more time to report incidents of common assault or battery against them. Currently, prosecutions must commence within six months of the offence.
Instead, this requirement will be moved to six months from the date the incident is formally reported to police – with an overall time limit of two years from the date of the offence to bring a prosecution. The government’s decision follows similar proposals put forward by Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, who tabled an amendment to the bill in the Commons last year. It followed the release of figures which showed that over 13,000 domestic abuse cases have been dropped by police over the last five years due to the time-limit. Welcoming the government’s amendments, Cooper said it is one of many measures Labour is pushing for to tackle violence against women and girls. Domestic abuse is often reported late relative to other crimes. The change is supposed to ensure that alleged victims have enough time to seek justice and that perpetrators answer for their actions. Dominic Raab, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, said: “We’re giving the victims of domestic abuse longer to report the offence to the police – so abusers don’t evade justice. “And we will introduce a new offence to stop people filming or taking photos of mothers breastfeeding without their consent – because no new mum should be harassed in this way.” The Voyeurism Act made it illegal to take a photograph under a person’s clothing without their consent but it does not specifically cover women who have to remove clothes to feed an infant. Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner, said: “It is important that all domestic abuse victims have the time and opportunity to report to the police. This is especially important following Covid restrictions, when many victims faced additional challenges to seeking help and reporting domestic abuse.” Reacting to the decision, Creasy said: “That breast pests can now be stopped is testament to the hard work of campaigner Julia Cooper, Jeff Smith, Lady Helene Hayman and Lord Pannick. We all worked across both the Lords and Commons to make the government listen to our call for change.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/breastfeeding-voyeurs-new-offence;7
347;347;5594;5594;Phil Harvey obituary;2022-01-04T17:45:00Z;['Penny Warren'];['Contraception and family planning', 'Sex', 'US news', 'Sexual health', 'Health', 'Life and style', 'Society', 'World news'];"The American social entrepreneur Phil Harvey, who has died aged 83, made contraception affordable for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world with subsidies provided by the profits from Adam & Eve, the sex shop company he founded in 1970. A committed libertarian, Harvey also used his considerable resources to champion the right to sexual healthcare and free speech in the US. While working in the Punjab in India in the 1960s for the charity Care International, Harvey became deeply uncomfortable about the way western countries distributed aid. A woman in a threadbare sari knelt before him in gratitude for the food he was doling out, and he became determined to find a way to give aid that did not humiliate recipients. He also began to think that the most urgent need for people in developing countries was better access to family planning, and that the distribution of contraception was inherently a marketing rather than a medical issue. He theorised that the most effective way to distribute condoms might be to use social marketing techniques. This meant bypassing doctors and clinics and subsidising their sale in ordinary shops or market stalls, promoted through local advertising campaigns. Returning to the US in 1969, Harvey studied public health at the University of North Carolina, where he met a British doctor, Tim Black, who shared his zeal for family planning. Keen to test out Harvey’s social marketing ideas, they decided to see if they could persuade people in the US to buy condoms through the post, and ran eye-catching ads in 300 college magazines with slogans such as “What will you get her this Christmas – pregnant?” It was a risky business as it was illegal at the time to send contraceptives (deemed an “obscene product”) through the US postal system. However, an avalanche of orders arrived and no prosecutions ensued. Emboldened, in 1971 Harvey founded Adam & Eve, the first mail-order contraceptive business in the US, which he soon expanded to include the sale of erotica and sex aids and which now has a chain of retail stores. Business boomed, and using the proceeds from Adam & Eve, Harvey and Black founded Population Services International (PSI) a non-profit organisation that started a social marketing programme to sell condoms in Kenya. Adam & Eve customers had no idea they were subsidising cheap contraception abroad, and Harvey saw no reason to advertise the connection, arguing that altruism exists in a different part of the brain from wanting to have a good time on a Saturday night. When it came to starting up foreign programmes, he was also a hands-off manager, believing in hiring the best people locally, setting out his vision, and then allowing them to use their initiative to achieve the desired result. Harvey stepped down as leader of PSI in 1977, believing it was wrong for the founder to stay at the helm indefinitely. By that time he was in any case involved with a second organisation: Marie Stopes, now MSI Reproductive Choices. The London family planning clinic had run into financial difficulties and in 1976 Harvey and Black rescued it, buying up its original clinic in Whitfield Street. Harvey became a long-term board member, helping it to grow from providing 150,000 women annually with contraception and safe abortions in the 70s to more than 12 million a year today. Finally, in 1989 Harvey founded DKT International, named in honour of his friend Dharmendra Kumar Tyagi, an official in charge of India’s family planning programme. It operates in a similar way to PSI, has subsidised the sale of more than one billion cheap contraceptives in 90 countries, and is active in sex education and HIV prevention. Harvey was born in Evanston, Illinois, to William, a farm tool supplier, and his wife, Lucy (nee Smith). The youngest of five siblings, taciturn, private and a deep thinker, he went to Harvard University in 1957 to study Slavic languages and literature. In 1963 he joined Care International to work in India, spending several years with the organisation before returning to the US and branching out with Black. As head of Adam & Eve and a committed libertarian, Harvey soon became embroiled in legal battles to defend people’s access to sexual healthcare. In 1977 he challenged a law in New York state that prohibited the advertising and display of contraceptives. The case went to the supreme court and he won, arguing that advertising was protected by the first amendment and the right to free speech. In 1986 Adam & Eve’s offices were raided by the police and Harvey was charged with disseminating obscenity. Ronald Reagan’s administration hoped to close down the adult entertainment industry and filed lawsuits against the company in many different states, trusting that the financial burden would make it buckle. But Harvey fought back, winning a lawsuit against the justice department in 1990 on the grounds that it had abused its power. In 1987 he had also successfully challenged Reagan’s Mexico City policy, known as the “global gag”, which aimed to prevent any organisation that received a grant from the US Agency for International Development from performing, referring to, or even speaking about, safe abortion care. To the end of his life Harvey supported organisations that fought to oppose government control of people’s private lives. He also founded the DKT Liberty Project, which campaigns on issues such as stopping the government from confiscating people’s assets, helping patients access medical marijuana, and safeguarding the right to free speech. He wrote about his work and philosophy in books that included Let Every Child Be Wanted (1999) and The Government vs Erotica (2001). He was also a novelist, writing, among other titles, the psychological thriller Show Time (2012). In 1990 Harvey married the artist Harriet Lesser. She survives him, as do her two children from a previous relationship, and three grandchildren. • Philip Dow Harvey, social entrepreneur, born 25 April 1938; died 2 December 2021";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/04/phil-harvey-obituary;5
348;348;5595;5595;Emma Watson pro-Palestinian post sparks antisemitism row;2022-01-04T17:28:19Z;['Nadia Khomami'];['Israel', 'Palestinian territories', 'Emma Watson', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'World news', 'Film', 'Culture'];"Emma Watson has been accused of antisemitism by Israel’s former ambassador to the United Nations after she posted a message of support for the Palestinian cause. Watson, best known for playing Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films, posted an image on Instagram showing a photograph of a pro-Palestinian protest with the banner “Solidarity is a Verb” written across it. It was accompanied with a quote about the meaning of solidarity from the intersectional feminist scholar Sara Ahmed. While the post elicited widespread support from Palestinian activists, it drew strong criticism from Israeli officials. The most combative was Danny Danon, who formerly held the posts of science minister in Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. Sharing Watson’s post on Twitter, Dannon said: “10 points from Gryffindor for being an antisemite.” Israel’s current ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, was also critical. “Fiction may work in Harry Potter but it does not work in reality,” Erdan wrote. “If it did, the magic used in the wizarding world could eliminate the evils of Hamas (which oppresses women and seeks the annihilation of Israel) and the PA (which supports terror). I would be in favor of that!” PA refers to the Palestinian Authority. Danon’s comments were met with a backlash, including from Leah Greenberg, a co-executive director of Indivisible Project, a non-profit organisation founded in 2016 in response to the election of Donald Trump. “A perfect demonstration of the utterly cynical and bad-faith weaponization of antisemitism to shut down basic expressions of solidarity with the Palestinian people,” she wrote. The Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi called Danon’s comments “appalling”. “These constant attempts to stifle any and all support for Palestinians must be called out,” she said.
Watson, 31, is an outspoken feminist who has used her platform to support a number of high-profile causes, earning her a spot on Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2015. In 2014 she was appointed as a UN women’s goodwill ambassador and delivered an address at the UN headquarters in New York to launch HeForShe, a campaign that urges men to advocate women’s equality. A year later Malala Yousafzai told Watson she had decided to call herself a feminist after hearing her speech. Watson was appointed to a G7 advisory body for women’s rights in 2019, consulting with leaders on foreign policy.
During Cop26 in Glasgow last year, Watson gave climate activists access to her Instagram account. Her bio still says the account “has been taken over by an anonymous Feminist Collective”. The image posted by Watson’s account was originally created by the Bad Activist Collective during clashes last year in which Israeli jets bombed Gaza in response to rocket attacks. At the time other celebrities including Bella Hadid, Dua Lipa and Susan Sarandon expressed their solidarity with the Palestinian cause. Ahmed’s full quote, cited in part by Watson, said: “Solidarity does not assume that our struggles are the same struggles, or that our pain is the same pain, or that our hope is for the same future. Solidarity involves commitment, and work, as well as the recognition that even if we do not have the same feelings, or the same lives, or the same bodies, we do live on common ground.” Watson’s post has been liked by more than a million users and attracted more than 100,000 comments – many of which include either Palestinian or Israeli flags.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/emma-watson-pro-palestinian-post-sparks-antisemitism-row;2
349;349;5596;5596;Gas price hike of more than 30% stokes home bills fears for Europe;2022-01-04T17:26:25Z;['Rob Davies'];['Gas', 'Business', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Commodities', 'Utilities', 'Opec', 'Oil and gas companies', 'Energy bills', 'Consumer affairs', 'Energy industry', 'Household bills', 'UK news'];European gas prices have risen by more than 30% on Tuesday, adding to mounting concerns about the cost of heating a home, as supplies that usually come into Europe from Siberia continued to flow eastwards for the 15th day in a row. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied using Russia’s vast gas resources to turn the screw on Europe, after gas coming through the Yamal-Europe pipeline reversed direction three days before Christmas. Data from the Mallnow metering point on the German-Polish border on Tuesday showed that the eastwards flow of gas has increased, with volumes hitting almost 9.9m kilowatt hours an hour (kWh/h), up from 5.8m previously. Eastbound volumes via the Yamal-Europe pipeline hit almost 9.9m kWh/h at the Mallnow metering point on the German-Polish border on Tuesday morning, the data showed, up from 5.8m previously. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said last month that Germany was reselling Russian gas to Poland and Ukraine rather than relieving price pressure, blaming German gas importers for the reversal of flows and soaring prices. The German government has declined to comment on Putin’s remarks. The benchmark Dutch front-month gas contract was up 32% at €95.20 (£79.40) a megawatt hour (MWh) by mid-afternoon on Tuesday, with the day-ahead contract up €29 at €95.50 MWh. The UK’s wholesale natural gas benchmark, the National Balancing Point, was up 38% at 236p a therm. Europe has been at the heart of an energy crisis since last year, when the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions put huge demands on depleted stocks of natural gas. Benchmark prices have more than quintupled since January 2021, squeezing consumers and companies and threatening the region’s economic recovery. In the UK, energy suppliers have warned that average gas bills could rise to more than £2,000 a year in April, when a cap on prices is revised upwards, piling pressure on the government to act to bring prices down amid a broader cost of living crisis. Expectations for colder weather in Europe were contributing to upward pressure on prices, but the low Russian gas flows were the main driver, a trader said. Separately, the Opec+ cartel of oil-producing nations resolved to press ahead with plans to increase output, signalling their optimism that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 will have only a short-term impact on global growth. The 23-member alliance, led by Opec member Saudi Arabia and non-member Russia, stuck to a plan for a modest output increase of 400,000 barrels a day in February. The increase is part of a gradual unwinding of the 10m barrel-a-day production cuts made in 2020 as travel and transport slowed dramatically. Brent crude rose 50% last year as the global economy began to recover from the depths of 2020 and has rallied so far in the early days of 2022, trading 2% up above $80 (£59) on Tuesday. The US had urged Opec and its allies, led by Russia, to increase output to help keep a lid on prices in order not to dampen the nascent demand for fuel and slow that recovery. While the oil-producing nations opted for a slower increase than the US has called for, any rise in the volume of crude they pump indicates confidence that Omicron is not causing demand for fuel to plummet. In a technical report, Opec said the variant would be “mild and short-lived” and was upbeat about economic prospects. “This is in addition to a steady economic outlook in both the advanced and emerging economies,” the joint technical committee report said.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/gas-price-hike-of-more-than-30-stokes-home-bills-fears-for-europe;3
350;350;5597;5597;UK weather: first widespread frost of winter due this week;2022-01-04T17:22:00Z;['Mark Brown'];['UK weather', 'UK news', 'Snow', 'Scotland', 'Northern Ireland', 'Wales', 'England'];Weather forecasters are predicting the UK’s first widespread frost of the winter with overnight temperatures expected to dip below freezing on Wednesday and into Thursday. Later in the week many parts of western Scotland, north-west England and Northern Ireland could be affected by treacherous icy conditions and snow as wintry showers arrive from the west. The warnings are in marked contrast to a spell of mild weather, with record new year temperatures across the UK thanks to a flow of warm subtropical air from the Azores. The highest on New Year’s Eve, 16.5C (61.7F), was recorded in Bala in north Wales. On New Year’s Day 16.3C was recorded in St James’s Park, central London, provisionally setting a record, the Met Office said. The cold weather forecast this week is much more in line with what is expected at this time of year, forecasters said. Yellow weather warnings were issued by the Met Office for Wednesday and Friday. The Wednesday warning is for snow showers and icy stretches in the north of Scotland with 10-15cm of snow possible in higher places. The Friday warning is for sleet and snow showers covering the north-west of England and western parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland. It could mean difficult driving conditions and disruption to travel. Richard Miles, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said the fall in temperatures into Thursday would give the UK the first widespread frost of the winter. “It’s going to be colder than we have been used to over the last couple of days and Christmas,” he said. “We are going into a period when temperatures will be dropping quite a bit.” For some, bitterly cold temperatures arrived on Tuesday morning with -6C recorded in Shap, Cumbria. Many people in County Durham and Northumberland woke up to fresh snowfall. On Tuesday snow and strong winds in northern Scotland brought difficult travel conditions and disruption to a number of ferry services. On one of the busiest routes, between Ardrossan in North Ayrshire and Brodick on the Isle of Arran, services were cancelled from mid-morning. Many areas of the UK remain at risk of flooding. In England, there were 47 flood alerts and four flood warnings on the east coast on Tuesday afternoon as a result of higher than normal tides. In Scotland, there were six flood alerts and six warnings. In Wales, a flood alert for the north Wales coast, from the Dee estuary to the east coast of Anglesey, was due to remain in place until Wednesday. Looking towards the weekend forecasters said temperatures were expected to rise slightly, but the picture remained unsettled with wintry showers expected for some. The Met Office on Tuesday issued a yellow weather warning of icy patches for northern England. In northern Scotland, a yellow warning was given for snow showers and ice, while “very strong winds” in the far north were expected to bring travel delays and short-term power cuts.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/uk-weather-cold-snap-brings-snow-and-ice-as-temperatures-plummet-met-office;3
351;351;5598;5598;Scientists call for Covid reinfections in UK to be included in case figures;2022-01-04T17:16:37Z;['Nicola Davis'];['Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'World news', 'Microbiology', 'Science'];"Reinfections should be included in Covid figures for the UK as soon as possible, scientists have said, amid warnings that up to 15% of Omicron cases could be people who have had coronavirus before. At present, daily Covid case figures – which reflect the number of infections picked up by testing – do not include reinfections for all countries of the UK. While figures for Wales do include multiple cases for the same person, provided the positive tests are more than 42 days apart, this is not the case for England, Scotland or Northern Ireland. However scientists have said that with the proportion of cases that are reinfections growing, such figures should be urgently updated. “The reinfection rate was fairly low with Delta, but is higher now, both because prior infection provides little protection against Omicron, and there is a bigger pool of people with prior infection,” said Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge. According to a report released by researchers at Imperial College London last month, the risk of reinfection with Omicron is more than five times higher than with Delta. Speaking on the Today programme on Tuesday, leading epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College said between 10% and 15% of Omicron cases are reinfections. The figure chimes with data released by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which found that of 116,683 people identified as having an Omicron infection in England between 1 November and 18 December last year, 11,103 – or 9.5% – had previously tested positive for Covid more than 90 days ago, and hence would be identified as being reinfected. The Guardian understands that reinfections were not included in the case figures published on the government’s dashboard at the start of the pandemic as it was uncertain at the time whether it was possible to be reinfected and, if it was, the interval between infections.
Tim Colbourn, professor of global health systems, epidemiology and evaluation at University College London (UCL), said the case data should now be updated. “I think reinfections should be added to the dashboard as soon as possible as they will be a growing proportion of cases going forwards,” he said. “10-15% now sounds plausible and I’m sure the [proportion] will increase over the coming weeks as immunity from prior infection and vaccination wanes.” Prof Christina Pagel, director of UCL’s Clinical Operational Research Unit, agreed that the proportion of all Covid cases that are reinfections will continue to grow, although the rate of rise is going to be modest now that Omicron is the dominant variant in the UK and the lower reinfection rates with Delta are no longer part of the overall case picture. Pagel added that in order to understand how quickly an immune-evasive variant is spreading, it is important to include reinfections. “As more and more people get infected, given current policies, over the longer term it’s going to be rare to find someone who’s never had Covid,” she said, although she added many people who have had an infection will never have had a test. The Guardian understands the UKHSA is planning to include reinfections in case data from the end of the month, though Pagel – who is not involved with the dashboard –said the task is not simple. “My understanding is that most of the complex, interlinked data tables that underlie the dashboard need to be changed to include reinfections and that is just a massive job,” she said.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/scientists-call-covid-reinfections-uk-be-included-case-figures-omicron;6
352;352;5599;5599;Jury in Colston statue trial urged to ‘be on the right side of history’;2022-01-04T17:12:19Z;['Damien Gayle'];['Bristol'];"A jury has been urged to “be on the right side of history” by acquitting four defendants accused of criminal damage over the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston. In closing speeches at Bristol crown court on Tuesday, barristers for the accused argued that the statue, which stood over the multicultural south-west city for 125 years, was so indecent and potentially abusive that it constituted a crime. “Make no mistake members of the jury, your decision is not just going to be felt in this court room or this city,” said Liam Walker QC, representing Sage Willoughby. “It will be reverberate around the world. I urge you all to be on the right side of history.” Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, are accused with “others unknown” of helping to tie ropes around the statue’s neck and using them to pull it from its plinth in Bristol during a Black Lives Matter protest on 7 June 2020. They are on trial alongside Jake Skuse, 33, who is accused of helping roll it to Bristol harbour, where it was thrown into the River Avon. All have argued that their actions were justified by the offence the statue caused. “Each of these defendants were on the right side of history, and I submit, they were also on the right side of the law,” said Walker. “Colston’s deeds may be historical, but the continued veneration of him in this city was not. The continued veneration of him in a vibrant multicultural city was an act of abuse. “Colston’s statue normalised abuse. It condoned the shrugging acceptance of racism. It celebrated the achievements of a racist mass murderer. The continued existence of that statue was a racist hate crime.”
Tom Wainwright, representing Ponsford, suggested that the historical significance, and hence the value, of the statue had been increased by its toppling – that rather than destroying history, those on trial had “created history”, while at the same time correcting the record on Colston’s crimes. “You may think it would bring the criminal justice system into disrepute if a person were convicted of criminally damaging something by adding value to it, by improving it,” Wainwright said. “Ask yourselves: what value did this statue have before 7 June 2020, and what value does it have now?” Closing for the crown, William Hughes QC told jurors that it was not Colston who was standing trial. “We made it clear when we first addressed you at the start of this case that we didn’t dispute that Edward Colston’s history was awash with his hands-on involvement with the slave trade,” Hughes said. “You have heard detailed, highly emotive evidence in that regard from David Olusoga. We are not apologists for Edward Colston but he and those of his ilk are not on trial.” Hughes said that despite the wide-ranging evidence heard of Colston’s, and Bristol’s, involvement in the slave trade; the impact of the statue on the city’s current black residents; and the failure of local politicians to take action, the trial was “not a public inquiry”, not about politics or emotions. “This trial is about cold hard facts and it is fundamentally about the rule of law,” Hughes said. “If we can simply pull down what offends us regardless of the views of others then what statues, institutions or buildings are next, you might ask.” Skuse, Graham, Ponsford and Willoughby all deny criminal damage. The trial continues.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/jury-in-colston-statue-trial-urged-to-be-on-the-right-side-of-history;1
353;353;5600;5600;Paraguayan presidential guard dies after being impaled by deer;2022-01-04T17:07:59Z;['N/A'];['Paraguay', 'Americas', 'World news', 'Animals'];"A Paraguayan military officer has died after being attacked by a deer that ran an antler through his chest while he was serving in a security detail at the presidential residence in the capital, Asunción. Infantry assistant sergeant Víctor Isasi Flecha, 42, died on Monday night as a result of “piercing injuries” caused by the animal, said a statement from the military forces of the South American country.
The deer was an axis deer from India, which had been donated to the presidential residence, the director of wildlife at the ministry of the environment, Frederick Bauer, told media. An infantry spokesman, Víctor Urdapilleta, said that closed circuit cameras captured the moment when the soldier approached the deer and he was attacked. “For unknown reasons he approached the area where the animals live and that’s where he was attacked. There has never been any such attack before,’” Urdapilleta told the newspaper ABC Color. Flecha appeared to have made a movement which startled the animal, Urdapilleta said. He was declared dead in a military hospital. Urdapilleta said there was no history of a similar attack by animals routinely kept in the presidential residence, which have included ostriches and ponies in previous administrations. The animals are kept in a restricted area and are not in routine contact with visitors to the residence, which is located in a residential area of the capital city.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/paraguay-military-officer-dead-deer-attack;7
354;354;5601;5601;Revealed: just 7% of trafficking victims given leave to remain in UK;2022-01-04T16:56:08Z;['Diane Taylor'];['Immigration and asylum', 'UK news', 'Modern slavery'];Only 7% of confirmed victims of trafficking from overseas have been granted leave to remain in the last five years according to new data disclosed to the Guardian. A Home Office data shows that 447 out of 6,066 confirmed trafficking victims who requested leave to remain between April 2016 and June 2021 were granted it – 7%. Meanwhile, 4,695 confirmed trafficking victims had their applications for leave to remain in the UK rejected, according to the response to a freedom of information response request by the Scottish Refugee Council (SRC). In the remainder of cases a decision is still pending. The government has repeatedly pledged to protect trafficking victims. But charities have documented that some of those removed from the UK and returned to their home countries have fallen back into the hands of their traffickers or have been vulnerable to being picked up by new traffickers. A landmark high court judgment in October 2021 said that all confirmed trafficking victims should be granted leave to remain in the UK. Ahmed Aydeed of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, the lawyer who brought the high court case, expressed concern about the new trafficking data. “Victims of trafficking, experience a profound loss of their sense of safety and security. A reliably safe environment is a pre-requisite for recovery. By refusing, en masse it seems, leave to remain to victims, the home secretary is re-traumatising survivors and putting them at risk of being re-trafficked.” The SRC has also obtained freedom of information data which reveals that the delay in processing asylum claims has reached the highest figure for two decades with 83,733 people waiting for an initial decision on an asylum claim with 56,520 of them – including 3,796 Afghans – waiting for more than six months for an initial decision. The SRC says the newly released data is evidence of a system that is failing asylum seekers and victims of trafficking. They have shared the data ahead of the second reading of the nationality and borders bill in the House of Lords on Wednesday. SRC campaigners have urged the Lords to vote down the controversial bill which proposes “offshoring” asylum seekers to third countries while their claims are processed and imposing criminal penalties on asylum seekers who travel across the Channel in small boats to claim asylum in the UK. The new bill also proposes narrowing the grounds for discretionary leave to remain for trafficking survivors which has led to fears among anti-trafficking campaigners that very few modern slavery survivors will be allowed to remain in the UK. Graham O’Neil of the SRC said: “There is a real crisis in the chronically slow asylum decision system that awaits them. It entraps women, men and children into state-enforced poverty limbo for years. This is even when they are from high refugee recognition countries like Afghanistan, Syria and Iran. We urge the Lords to dismantle the bill, and for the government to scrap it, and invest in swifter better asylum decisions.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “A significant proportion of asylum claims in the last year should have been made in a first safe country, rather than people risking their lives making dangerous crossings, facilitated by people smugglers. “This, as well as an overall increase in claims, has led to asylum applications taking longer to be resolved and impaired our ability to focus resources on those who come to the UK via safe and legal routes and are in genuine need of our protection. “The government is committed to tackling modern slavery and providing support and protection to the victims of this heinous crime. The nationality and borders bill will go further than ever before in putting modern slavery victims’ rights into law, including granting temporary leave to remain for victims.”;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/trafficking-victims-leave-to-remain-uk-data;2
355;355;5602;5602;The Breakdown | Covid clouds hopes for ‘normal’ Six Nations and Champions Cup;2022-01-04T16:47:35Z;['Robert Kitson'];['Six Nations', 'Champions Cup', 'Premiership', 'Rugby union', 'Sport', 'Six Nations 2022'];"The festive season is over and for rugby’s administrators a pivotal month awaits. Covid infection rates and strict travel regulations are threatening to disrupt the start of the 2022 Six Nations championship and the European club pool stages with crucial talks between unions and governments in full swing this week. A nervous, knife-edge January looms. What, say, are the odds on thousands of English and Welsh fans being encouraged to travel en masse to Edinburgh and Dublin, respectively, for round one of the Six Nations in just over four weeks’ time? Or being sufficiently free of Omicron to do so? With no slack in rugby’s absurdly congested fixture calendar, the games are set to go ahead as scheduled but no one can be sure how many spectators will be present.
Despite the strict crowd restrictions now in place across Scotland, Ireland and Wales, Six Nations organisers insist it is premature to speculate about staging games behind closed doors. But as things stand, only 500 people are allowed at outdoor sports events in Scotland while in Ireland the maximum figure is 5,000. While hopes are high for an improved situation by March and April, unleashing thousands of travelling Six Nations fans next month may undermine that ambition. In France, moreover there have been other significant developments. Not only have crowd sizes been limited to just 5,000 outside and 2,000 inside for the next three weeks – coinciding with rounds three and four of the Champions Cup – but stricter measures around vaccination are set to come into effect from 15 January. From Saturday week it will be a requirement in France to show a vaccine pass to attend a game as a spectator, official, staff member or, significantly, as a player. No longer, as things stand, will unvaccinated individuals be allowed in on the basis of a recent negative Covid test. Which means some high‑profile players on both sides of the Channel will have to get themselves jabbed or they will not be welcome inside the ground, let alone the field of play. It is clearly a potential game‑changer for some. Premiership Rugby says 96% of their players and management are now double vaccinated while the comparable figure in France is said to be 98%. With expanded player squads eligible for Europe this season, however, that still leaves several dozen individuals unvaccinated and, barring a softening of the rules, unavailable. What will this mean for those clubs with big European pool games in France over the next fortnight? Bath, Sale and Scarlets are all in France for Champions Cup fixtures next weekend and Cardiff, Connacht, Northampton and Exeter are due to travel across the Channel in round four. Newcastle are also due to play Challenge Cup games in Biarritz and Toulon on successive weekends; what a perfect working holiday that might have been in other circumstances but, on cost grounds, Falcons plan to commute to both games rather than stay put. At least one of the aforementioned teams, the Guardian understands, are in the clear because 100% of their players are fully vaccinated. Which places them in a different league from some other sports. Before Christmas the English Football League revealed that 25% of its players did not intend to get a vaccine, with only 59% already double vaccinated. Let’s just say the unvaccinated minority might be wise to hesitate before accepting an 11th-hour January transfer window offer from France.
Back on planet rugby logistical talks have been continuing. Some interesting contingency plans have also been floated. There have even been discussions about moving affected games to another country, possibly Ireland, though nothing has yet been rubber‑stamped. Would something such as that be feasible? Imagine if multiple teams and their entourages were holed up in the same hotel bar for 10 days? Fun but possibly not exactly what the doctor ordered. Then again, if infection rates keep rising across Europe over the next fortnight, who knows? The testing uncertainty was already mounting even before the most recent Premiership screening figures were announced. Between Christmas Eve and 30 December 4,446 lateral flow and PCR tests were taken by Premiership players and management as part of the league’s Covid-19 screening programme. No fewer than 55 people from 11 clubs tested positive, while Bath’s first game of the year, away at London Irish on Monday, was called off after a “significant number” of their playing squad were ruled out. It was a reminder that, in the great scheme of things, rugby cannot entirely control its own destiny. The financial drip-drip effect of all this disruption is also increasingly hard to ignore. The tightened salary cap is already squeezing player salaries and employment opportunities and clubs badly need the matchday income that has latterly been flowing back.
To see 70,000-plus tickets sold for the Big Game at Twickenham last week was to be forcibly reminded of what the past two Premiership finals have lacked – and what the Six Nations again risks losing. To attend the Exeter v Bristol game on New Year’s Day was also to experience the stark contrasts in health and safety interpretations around the UK. No one checked any of our family’s Covid passes on the way in, barely 20% of the 14,100 attendance were masked and our narrow, cheek-by-jowl seats behind the posts made social distancing a forlorn dream. Was it: a) an enticing vision of an imminent “normal” life or b) a super-spreader paradise? Rugby’s custodians can only pray the former wins the day. • This is an extract from our rugby union email, the Breakdown.

356;356;5603;5603;Stephen Colbert on 2022: ‘An unprecedented third year of 2020’;2022-01-04T16:41:22Z;['Adrian Horton'];['Late-night TV roundup', 'Stephen Colbert', 'Seth Meyers', 'Jimmy Kimmel', 'TV comedy', 'Comedy', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Television'];"Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert returned to his first Late Show of 2022 – “an unprecedented third straight year of 2020” – with an update on Covid’s Omicron variant, which surged across the US over the holidays.
In the past week, the US logged more than 400,000 new cases of Covid each day, tripling from two weeks ago. “That is awful – the only thing that should be tripling over the holidays is my BMI,” he joked. The Omicron surge wreaked havoc on holiday travel – airlines cancelled more than 12,000 flights between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Day, and New York City suspended several subway lines due to staffing issues. “What? Closing the subway because of the germs is like closing Broadway because of jazz hands,” Colbert observed.
Partly in response to widespread staffing shortages, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week cut the isolation time for Americans who test positive from 10 days to five. “They also say you can swim right after you eat, breaking a mirror only gives you four years bad luck, and stepping on a crack won’t break your mother’s back, but her back will just be very disappointed,” Colbert quipped. Some have raised suspicions about the timing of the policy change, as just days before the announcement, the CEO of Delta Air Lines asked the CDC for a five-day isolation guidance. “Well, that’s just longstanding policy: if your business is named after a variant, you get to make one rule,” Colbert joked. Seth Meyers
On the Late Show, Seth Meyers celebrated Twitter’s permanent suspension of Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s personal account for repeatedly posting Covid misinformation. Greene, a rightwing extremist and conspiracy theorist, had tweeted recently that vaccines were “failing and the Democrats are tyrants … The entire effort should be focused on life saving treatments and returning life to normal … Wide open. No masks. No mandates. No discrimination.” “We all want to get back to normal!” Meyers exclaimed. “You’re the ones who want to live with this endless cycle of misery and death and just let a highly contagious respiratory virus ravage the country. That’s not normal. The rest of us just want to slow the spread of Covid and get back to something that’s actually normal. “Regardless of how you feel about the ethics of kicking politicians off Twitter, it’s just a huge quality of life improvement, like when Trump got kicked off Twitter,” Meyers added. “Trying to live in a world where people like Trump and Greene are constantly screaming insane shit on Twitter is like trying to have a conversation with a friend on the street next to a jackhammer.” Jimmy Fallon
And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon also rang in the new year with a sense of pandemic dread. “I like having new year’s resolutions because you can just make them up as you go, sort of like the CDC rules on Covid,” he joked. The host also remarked on the blizzard which hit Washington DC on Monday, stranding Joe Biden on Air Force One when the runway’s mobile staircase got trapped in snow. “The last time DC was hit with that much whiteness it was January 6,” said Fallon. “Seriously, there hasn’t been that much white powder since Jeff Bezos’s new year’s party.” Fallon then returned to the CDC’s recommendation change for Covid isolation from 10 days to five days. “A lot of Covid regulations keep changing the longer the pandemic goes on,” he said. “For example, back then, doctors said to cough directly into your elbow. Now doctors say ‘just have fun out there’. “Also back then, you had to wash your hands for as long as it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice,” he joked. “But now you can sing it at the speed Applebee’s employees do when you can tell they’re not really into it.”";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/04/stephen-colbert-2022-omicron-late-show-recap;5
357;357;5604;5604;The Hunt for Bible John – is this the best true-crime documentary ever made?;2022-01-04T16:40:43Z;['Stuart Heritage'];['Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'BBC Two', 'BBC', 'Crime', 'Glasgow', 'Documentary', 'Factual TV', 'Scotland'];"One of the biggest television wishes I harbour for this year is the end of true-crime documentaries. Ever since Netflix’s Making a Murderer hit big in 2015, the genre has found itself crashing from new low to new low. The majority of true crime shows since then have been grubby and exploitative – so quick to rush towards sensationalist thrills that they teeter on the brink of idolising criminals at the expense of victims. If I never watched another true-crime documentary, I’d be the world’s happiest boy. So it’s irritating to discover that the first big true-crime documentary of the year is one of the best I’ve seen. The Hunt for Bible John (BBC Two) is technically not new – it aired on BBC Scotland late last year – but its BBC Two debut this week should bring it wider attention. If it does, it will be absolutely warranted. The Hunt for Bible John tells the story of Scotland’s most notorious series of murders. In 1968 and 69, three young women were killed. All three had been dancing at Glasgow’s Barrowland Ballroom, and all three were found beaten and strangled. The nickname came from witness reports of the killer quoting from the Bible. The murderer has never been caught. In other hands, this could easily have become just another true-crime documentary, trading on nothing but cheap gratification and bloodlust. What’s so impressive here is how keenly the series wants to fit the murders into a wider societal context. A long introductory tract is dedicated to the state of Glasgow in the 60s. Grim and dark and still bomb-damaged from the war, it is a city in total collapse. Running water is scarce, open drains burble human effluent in the streets. The one escape, we are told, is dancing. This took place in venues such as Barrowland: dark, heady clubs where young men and women could meet and forget the outside world.
The clubs were a hive of anonymity – married men apparently made a point of visiting, twisting off their wedding rings in the toilets then hitting on girls under assumed identities – which provided perfect cover for Bible John – a tall, well-spoken man who reportedly liked to recite Old Testament verse. Reportedly is the key word. The secret of The Hunt for Bible John is that it isn’t really about Bible John – we’re shown a handful of suspects, but they’re quickly tossed aside – but about how utterly out of their depths the detectives were. The purported iniquity of the dance clubs meant that witnesses were loth to reveal themselves. The media coverage of the murders quickly whipped up a fearful hysteria that spread across the city. To this day, nobody can be completely sure if all three murders were committed by the same man. The best parts of The Hunt for Bible John show the police’s desperate attempts to try anything that could bring the murderer to justice. For the first time in Scottish history, newspapers ran an artist’s impression of Bible John. He was the subject of one of Britain’s first photofits. Places of worship were scoured, since you can’t get a nickname like Bible John without regularly attending church. They created a psychological portrait of the man. They flew in a clairvoyant from Belgium. Anything that could possibly stick was tried, and all to no avail. Fans of David Fincher might know where this is going. One key touchpoint here is Zodiac – a film about another real-life serial killer who was never caught – with the show even going as far as to use songs from its soundtrack. Another is Mindhunter, Fincher’s series about the birth of the FBI’s Behavioural Science Unit. Mindhunter depicted a crucial turning point in the understanding and capture of serial killers as we know them; their compulsions, their motivations, their patterns. If Glasgow detectives had had the benefit of this expertise, Bible John might not have managed to evade justice so effectively. But his murders took place just before this development, in a city that had been all but written off. The police never stood a chance. With everything we have now – improved knowledge of serial killers and advances in forensic technology – surely many, if not all, of these murders could have been prevented. This is the real message of The Hunt for Bible John, and it’s chilling. Less than a week in and we already have the best true-crime documentary of the year. Now, please: nobody make me watch any more of them. The Hunt for Bible John is on BBC Two on Tuesday 4 January at 9pm and is available via BBC iPlayer.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/04/the-hunt-for-bible-john-is-this-the-best-true-crime-documentary-ever-made;2
358;358;5605;5605;Swedbank ex-chief charged over money laundering scandal;2022-01-04T16:39:36Z;['Mark Sweney'];['Banking', 'Sweden', 'Estonia', 'Business', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Denmark'];The former chief executive of Swedbank has been charged with fraud, market manipulation and the unauthorised disclosure of inside information, after an investigation into a large-scale money laundering scandal in the Baltics. Birgitte Bonnesen, who was sacked as chief executive two years ago when the scandal came to light, “repeatedly spread misleading information” that the bank did not have any issues with its anti-money laundering (AML) processes in Estonia, according to Sweden’s Economic Crime Authority. Thomas Langrot, the chief prosecutor and head of the investigation, said Bonnesen either intentionally or through gross negligence disseminated misleading information about the state of the bank’s anti-money laundering measures. This was despite Bonnesen having access to unpublished information about “extensive and serious shortcomings” about the system and information about “extensive suspicious transactions/customers”. An official report by law firm Clifford Chance, commissioned by Swedbank, found that the bank had carried out €37bn (£30bn) of transactions with a high risk of money laundering between 2014 and 2019. Langrot said there was evidence of a “cover-up” at Swedbank to stop the money laundering problems becoming public. “I have chosen to primarily prosecute for gross fraud, but there is a secondary claim regarding gross market manipulation,” said Langrot. “The misleading information gave a false impression that Swedbank did not have, or had, problems with AML processes in the bank’s operations in Estonia.” Last year, Swedbank said it would not file claims for damages against its former top executive and board. Swedbank and Danske Bank, Denmark’s biggest bank, remain under criminal and civil investigation by US regulators over money laundering scandals amounting to hundreds of billions of euros through their branches in the Baltics. Thomas Borgen resigned as chief executive of Danske Banke in 2018 after admitting that the vast majority of the €200bn flowing through its Estonian branch was laundered cash flowing illegally out of Russia, the UK and the British Virgin Islands.;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/swedbank-ex-chief-birgitte-bonnesen-charged-baltics-money-laundering-scandal;2
359;359;5606;5606;Belgium and Spain top Europe’s pre-pandemic robbery league ;2022-01-04T16:34:27Z;['Stephen Burgen'];['Europe', 'European Union', 'Spain', 'Belgium', 'UK news', 'Police'];Spain and Belgium have almost treble Europe’s average number of robberies, topping its robbery league, according to a Eurostat report. The figures, compiled from 2016-2019, before the pandemic, show robberies fell in Europe by 11% over the period, with an average of approximately 55 for every 100,000 people. In Belgium there were 146 police-reported robberies per 100,000, with 134 in Spain. The UK, at that point still in the EU, came third, with a score of 132, with Portugal fourth at 108. Hungary, at 7.4 per 100,000 people, had the lowest number of reported robberies. The Eurostat report covers the EU, the EFTA countries, as well as some EU candidate countries and potential candidate countries. While current pan-European figures have yet to be compiled, the pandemic, through a combination of lockdowns and the collapse of tourism, has seen a drastic fall in most crimes in countries with high crime rates, while it has had less impact on countries where crime was already low, such as Hungary. This has especially been the case in Spain where, compared with 2019, street robbery in 2021 fell by 34% and robbery with violence by 22%. In Barcelona the figures were 56% and 32% respectively, twice that of Madrid. As Barcelona is Spain’s – and, indeed, Europe’s – bag-snatching capital, this suggests the decline in tourism has been a decisive factor. In 2018 crime was up 17% in Barcelona, the highest increase in Spain, with an average of 12 robberies an hour, most in areas popular with tourists, according to Spain’s interior ministry. Other factors are Spain’s high youth unemployment, with more than 40% of under-25s unemployed in some regions. The relative impunity regarding petty theft is also seen as a contributing factor. The theft of goods worth less that €400 is treated as a misdemeanor punishable with a small fine. Repeat offenders are simply fined again as the offences are not cumulative. Nonetheless, the Economist’s 2021 Safe Cities Index ranked Barcelona as the fourth safest city in Europe and 11th in the world. Copenhagen was listed as the world’s safest. While robbery and pickpocketing have decreased dramatically during the pandemic, Spain’s drug-related crime is up 10% and sexual offences rose in 2021 by 9.2%, government statistics show. The 4.8m thefts across Europe in 2019 was the lowest figure since 2010, while the 1.1m drug-related crimes were the highest since 2008. Car thefts and homicide were down while there was an increase in assaults and sexual crimes. Some 36% of all intentional homicide victims in 2019 were female, with over 40% in Germany, Croatia, Denmark and the Czech Republic.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/belgium-and-spain-top-europes-pre-pandemic-robbery-league;2
360;360;5607;5607;Almost 220,000 new Covid cases recorded in UK;2022-01-04T16:33:04Z;['Ian Sample', 'Nicola Davis'];['Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'Hospitals', 'NHS', 'Society', 'Health'];"Confirmed daily Covid cases in the UK have hit another record high, with 218,724 reported in the past 24 hours. The latest figures – which reflect infections picked up by testing – bring the UK total for the past seven days to 1,269,878, up 51% on the week before. The true number of infections is estimated to be substantially higher as not all infections are captured by the testing programme. The highly transmissible Omicron variant has fuelled a sharp rise in coronavirus cases since early December. After taking hold in London and other urban centres, it has spread rapidly around the country. The number of daily Covid cases in the UK is now triple that seen at the height of last winter’s wave driven by the Alpha variant, first spotted in Kent. The official figures continue to be affected by disruption over Christmas and the new year, with Tuesday’s data for Northern Ireland covering a four-day period, and for Wales covering a two-day period. However, the data shows that 148,725 cases were reported on Tuesday in England alone, up from 137,541 the day before but below the recent high of 162,572 reported on New Year’s Day. The figures do not include cases that are reinfections. The data released on Tuesday shows there were 15,044 Covid patients in hospital in England, up from 9,546 the week before. The number has also risen in Scotland over the same period, from 599 to 1,147. Data was not reported for Wales or Northern Ireland on Tuesday.
While hospitalisations have risen steeply with the Omicron wave, immunity conferred by vaccines and past infection, combined with the variant being intrinsically milder, has kept daily admissions and bed occupancy substantially lower than during the peak last January. In last winter’s Covid wave, before mass vaccination, daily UK admissions exceeded 4,500, while the number of people in hospital with Covid neared 40,000 at the peak. There are early signs in London that cases have plateaued and may even be falling among 18- to 59-year-olds. But cases continue to rise in people aged 60 and over. It is unclear whether hospital admissions will increase substantially as Omicron infects these older, more vulnerable people, or whether the high uptake of Covid boosters will protect them enough to keep admissions down. Further uncertainty remains over the impact of mixing over Christmas and the new year. Many infections picked up in the past two weeks will not have had time to progress to severe disease, if they are going to, and feed through to hospitalisations. The picture will become clearer in the next two weeks and public health officials are watching London hospitals, in particular, for the first sign of high hospital admissions among older people. The government said a further 48 people had died in England, Northern Ireland and Wales within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. The numbers for Covid deaths in Scotland were not updated. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 174,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/almost-220000-new-covid-cases-recorded-in-uk;7
361;361;5608;5608;Three things with Angus Stone: ‘I most regret losing a cowboy boot, nicked backstage. They only took one’;2022-01-04T16:30:19Z;['Katie Cunningham'];['Life and style', 'Australian lifestyle', 'Australian music', 'Pop and rock', 'Angus and Julia Stone', 'Apple', 'Fleetwood Mac', 'Music'];"When the world first met Angus and Julia Stone, it was as a duo. The sibling act began releasing gentle folk-pop music in 2006, swiftly finding global success with hits like Big Jet Plane. The pair still make music together (their latest album, Life is Strange, arrived in 2021) but also have solo projects. Apart, their sounds have diverged: Julia released a record full of bright, shimmering pop music in April 2021 while Angus makes blissed-out rock as Dope Lemon. This Friday 7 January, Angus returns with his third album under the moniker, titled Rose Pink Cadillac.
Essential to every record Angus makes is a particular guitar: a 1960s Telecaster given to him by his father. Here, Stone tells us about that “holy grail” instrument, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. What I’d save from my house in a fire When we last toured the States, [Apple co-founder] Steve Wozniak would fly in to different shows we were playing. It was so cool seeing him at the front of the barrier – the biggest legend to walk Earth, singing all the lyrics to the tunes we had written. There was one show where we were chilling backstage and Steve came up and told me he wanted me to have something special, which he only had a few of. It was four [fake] $2 bills he had created back in the day. They have sneaky little markings on them that he only told me about. They look like a real bill – down to a tee – and would pass if put in circulation, but because they were created by the man that invented Apple, they are very precious to me.
He’s a legend, by the way – salt of the earth and a good storyteller. After shows, backstage, there would always be a group around him as he spoke. It was dope to see the legend live on. I’d also have to grab a special gift given to me by my beautiful sister Julia on my 30th birthday. It is a geometric crystal hanging light, made by an incredible artist called Asaf Zakay. It’s worth its weight in gold but it also signifies our time together, spending our 20s travelling the world and sharing what we created. It’s a piece of magic – a little portal to our relationship as brother and sister. My most useful object A gift given to me by my parents for my 21st. I grew up with this guitar that was basically regarded around the house and town as the holy grail of guitars: a unique 1960s Telecaster. I have never seen another like it in my many years on the road and we’ve been around some of the world’s most storied guitarists who would gawk at it. When we toured with Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey Buckingham and the gang were tripped out. It was my dad’s very first guitar that he bought off his guitar teacher. It lives on basically every record I’ve ever released. It’s become a defining sound of my albums and will stay that way for many more to come.
The item I most regret losing The item I most regret losing is a cowboy boot someone nicked from backstage in Amsterdam. They only took one, which was strange. So I have the other to be like “damn, one day we will reunite you with your comrade”. I hope whoever took it has some flowers growing in it, on a windowsill, somewhere in a small cobblestone street in Holland, and are enjoying it as much as I enjoy the one I have at home.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/05/three-things-with-angus-stone-i-most-regret-losing-a-cowboy-boot-nicked-backstage-they-only-took-one;5
362;362;5609;5609;How to move: with asthma;2022-01-04T16:30:19Z;['Natalie Parletta'];['Life and style', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Fitness', 'Asthma'];"Around one in 10 Australians – 2.7 million people – suffer from asthma, a chronic condition involving inflammation and narrowing of the airways. This can cause breathing difficulties, wheezing, chest tightness and coughing. Understandably, fear of triggering symptoms often leads to exercise avoidance. Some people avoid it due to a high symptom burden; others have exercise-induced asthma. Even people not in these categories live in fear of exacerbating symptoms, says Dr Sarah Valkenborghs from the University of Newcastle.
But this can be a catch-22. “With avoidance of sport and exercise comes de-conditioning,” says exercise physiologist Bridget Nash from Body Smart Health, adding that physical inactivity can also worsen symptoms. “For anyone with asthma, it is highly recommended to continue regular exercise to avoid this deconditioning cycle.” All people with asthma should benefit from an exercise program when taking the right precautions, according to the Australian Association for Exercise and Sports Science. Some might even excel – about 7% of Olympians overall and 25% of Olympic swimmers have asthma. Here are some general recommendations for taking the plunge – but it’s important to first consult with a health professional for individually tailored advice and an asthma management plan. The move: diaphragmatic breathing Most research on exercise for asthma has focused on aerobic activities. But Valkenborghs says increasing muscular strength will also deliver a multitude of benefits and is considered relatively safe. “The thing with strength training is you don’t increase your breathing that much at all.” The most relevant study on strength training for asthma found that diaphragmatic breathing was as effective as aerobic exercise in improving lung function. This involved putting weights on the stomach and breathing deeply from the belly to lift the weight up and down.
“A lot of individuals with asthma take shallow breaths, using the muscles of the neck to expand the lungs rather than taking deep breaths using the diaphragm,” Nash says. She recommends the upper body strengthening exercises lat pulldown or row through to her clients to promote better and deeper breathing. The class: yoga or pilates Indoor classes may help avoid potential outdoor triggers such as cold air, pollution and pollen. Yoga or Pilates are good choices, according to Nash. “Slowing down and focusing on good-quality breathing will help make sure we are getting those deep, full breaths in,” she says. “As you start to feel more confident, you can start to incorporate with some moderate-intensity strength training to help with global strength and other co-morbidities.” Aerobic exercise is highly recommended for improving asthma-related outcomes such as quality of life, asthma control, air flow, lung function and inflammation. When ready to move to more vigorous activities, Valkenborghs says spin and Hiit classes are a good option; or aqua aerobics, which would be ideal for people whose symptoms aren’t triggered by chlorine. For any aerobic exercise, she says, a 10–15-minute warm-up with low to moderate activity can help prevent sudden irritation to the lungs. The activity: walking There are plenty of free activities, of course. Even walking is very beneficial, says Valkenborghs, especially for someone with asthma who wants to embark on an exercise program and is a bit deconditioned or unfit. “It’s low risk for inducing asthma and can prepare the muscles and bones for future high-intensity exercise.”
As physical activity and fitness levels improve, they can start increasing the intensity by progressing to low-level interval training with intermittent walking and jogging, and later building up to a continuous jog or run, stop, run, stop. Cycling is also a good option. Swimming is ideal, especially at the beach for people triggered by chlorine. The air above the water contains virtually 100% humidity and in warm weather can provide minimal provocation to the lungs. The hard pass: scuba diving Scuba diving has long been a definite no-no for people with asthma, says Valkenborghs, although a small percentage of people with well-managed symptoms might get a doctor’s clearance. Nash says make sure to have your Ventolin when trying a new activity, and seek professional advice on breathing techniques.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/how-to-move-with-asthma;7
363;363;5610;5610;Easy wins: cutting down on alcohol – ‘your heart, liver, stomach and brain will thank you’;2022-01-04T16:30:19Z;['Celina Ribeiro'];['Health', 'Life and style', 'Alcohol', 'Society'];"Sometimes on a Monday or a Tuesday after work, I could really do with a G&T. Or a solitary chilled beer. Sometimes it’s just that kind of night. But if it’s a Monday or a Tuesday, the rule is this: no. Not after a hard day. Not out with friends. Not if there’s a half-full bottle of impeccably chilled pinot in the fridge. No.
Which isn’t to say that Wednesday to Sunday is a raging bacchanalian festival of booze. Rather, designating two unchanging, no-excuse-accepted alcohol-free days a week has had positive knock-on effects through the week. There are fewer times I drink alcohol at all, even on my “permitted” days, and on those days I do have alcohol I drink less. I thoroughly enjoy a glass of this or that, but sticking within the government’s not-long-ago revised down alcohol guidelines is easy. Drinking alcohol in Australia is often an all-or-nothing affair: teetotal rates (up until last year) have been steadily climbing, while a quarter of us exceed the single-session recommended limits at least once a month. It’s the latter kind of event which often leads one to swear off the stuff – particularly after the revelry of the new year. Abstinence, surely, must be the answer! An alcohol-free January! No – dry July! And so the months roll. But, for those who do not have problematic drinking levels, yet want to reduce their alcohol intake, what of a half-arsed abstinence?
“Any reduction in alcohol consumption can have short- and long-term physical and psychological benefits,” says Dr Nicole Lee of the National Drug Research Institute at Curtin University. “With people who drink regularly, when they reduce their drinking many find they sleep better, they can think more clearly during the day and they lose a bit of weight. Your heart, liver, stomach and brain will thank you.” While any reduction is good, Lee says that we should probably aim for a little better than my two-day rule. Ensuring three or four days a week are alcohol-free would make keeping within the recommended weekly intake easier. “Everyone is different,” she says. “Whatever helps you to maintain a reduction in drinking days is a good thing. You might need to try a few different strategies before you find one that’s right for you.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/05/easy-wins-cutting-down-on-alcohol-your-heart-liver-stomach-and-brain-will-thank-you;7
364;364;5611;5611;‘I understand my kid more’: how the pandemic changed parenting;2022-01-04T16:30:19Z;['Sophie Black'];['Family', 'Parents and parenting', 'Life and style', 'Society', 'Coronavirus'];"In mid-June 2020 in Melbourne, Asher’s next door neighbour complained about the plants their 12-year-old son was growing in an empty car space in the apartment complex. The body corporate threatened to fine them. In the midst of solo parenting their son through lockdown number two, it was the last straw. Asher decided to move out. To the country. It wasn’t an easy decision - it meant leaving behind the career they’d carved out over a decade, but “it’s a compromise and being a parent is a relationship that’s two-sided”.
The pandemic completely upended Asher’s plans for their son, and themselves. And while not all of us have moved the world for our kids, there are many things about the past two years that may well have changed how we parent, and our relationship with our children, permanently. John, a father of three from Melbourne, remembers back in the very anxious early days his 10-year-old daughter asked if they were going to die. He cried. “We changed then. Less news. More time spent focusing on our kids’ welfare.” Many parents are hollowed out by the anxiety they’ve carried for their children for the past two years while trying to mask their own. Hushed conversations about vaccines, diving to turn the news down as a kid’s eyes grow wider, attempting to empathise with a childhood plight we never had to deal with. There’s nothing quite like the rictus smile of a parent attempting to convince a child that another Zoom birthday is a really good time. “This is one of those times when the experience that children are having, parents are dealing with it themselves at the same time,” says the CEO of the Australian Childhood Foundation, Dr Joe Tucci, a psychologist and social worker. “It’s a lack of being able to control and plan, and we’re dealing with this existential threat in front of, and alongside, our children. As a result, parenting has become a far more adaptive process.” But as parents continue to grapple with the fallout of trauma – their own and their kids’ – some are realising that what they’ve learnt over the past two years has real and lasting value. ‘You pick up things you never noticed’ “The pandemic reset the importance of just being able to spend time with your children,” says Nick Tebbey, national executive officer of Relationships Australia. “People drew real strength from that, and were almost surprised by how much they enjoyed their time together.”
The national body, in partnership with Griffith University in Queensland, are in phase 2 of the Australian component of their Families Unlocked study to “look deeper at the medium- to long-term impacts of the pandemic on relationships and family life”. Some of the initial findings of the study show that while around two-thirds of people were anxious about their children’s wellbeing, those sorts of feelings weren’t mutually exclusive from a feeling of “we like being together”. “One of the things that we’re told over and over again is that people don’t want to lose that time,” says Tebbey. “Irrespective of all those other pressures and concerns and anxieties, there was something there that people really held on to.”
Of course, not every family cuddled around a jigsaw together, and as has been well established, some experienced an uptick in acute stress, financial pressure and domestic violence during lockdowns. But the desire for a continuation of more time with kids, regardless of their age, seems to cut across the vast majority of parents, even accommodating for the vastly different experiences of the pandemic. For many, Tucci says, the pandemic has reminded us that time together can be a sanctuary, not just for kids but for their parents. “And doing nothing together is even better,” he says. “There was a dad that I would see at the park near our house quite regularly during lockdowns. All he was doing with his three-year-old was lying down in the grass. They’d pick up a leaf and then they’d put it into a pile, and then they’d pick up another leaf and put it into some other pile. This is all they did. The kid was delighted.”
Some parents speaking to the Guardian had thought a lot about why they actually liked having their kids at home, given it was often also stressful and unpredictable. Some had a sense of making up for lost time, given their kids had spent a lot of time at daycare, other parents of older kids realised they genuinely enjoyed their teenagers’ company. Tebbey says there is now a much broader awareness of mental health among parents. They’ve been present to read the ripples, to observe their children far more closely. “Parents have become more attuned to their kids’ needs … because they’ll have noticed that small things set them off,” says Tucci. Patrick, a father of a seven-year-old, definitely feels “like I understand my kid more”. After home schooling one-on-one, “you pick up things you never noticed”. Intuition and letting go A 2021 study shows Australian fathers stepped up to do more childcare and housework during the pandemic, and as a result, more evenly shared the stresses and anxiety that comes with those roles too. Pre-pandemic, Patrick’s wife was the primary carer, but that changed to half and half during lockdown. Whether the more evenly distributed roles remains a trend across parents remains to be seen, but so far for Patrick it’s sticking. As for what Patrick learned about his son, who is autistic, the year taught him that his son is capable of more than he had thought. “Even small things to prove his independence, like getting his own dinner or being able to speak in more complex ways.” For Patrick, it’s been a wonderful thing to watch. “He is more capable than I give him credit for.” Extra time together taught Patrick to change his expectations of his son, and many other parents told the Guardian their kids surprised them in different ways, including realising they could be vulnerable around their children without the sky falling in.
Emily, a single mother of an 18-year-old and a 10-year-old who did her fair share of home schooling while in lockdown in regional Victoria, feels like she’s learnt “to be more honest with my kids about my own feelings and circumstances”. “It’s been a realisation for parents to know how much their children know,” Tucci says. “You suddenly realise how much your life is on show to them.” Emily reckons she’s a more intuitive parent than she was, more inclined to centre her children’s needs. “Don’t want to go to school? Maybe that’s OK.” This is big for someone like Emily. She comes from a “very, very education-oriented” family – her parents are both teachers – but the past two years has taught her “the importance of understanding my kids as individuals rather than as part of the education system as a whole”. “A lot of parents gave up trying to maintain that school frenzy of doing everything,” Tucci says. “And schools were gentler, too. They just sort of … slowed down. They were noticing what their children needed and their children just needed space. They needed time. They needed to play and they needed relationships, which is what kids have always needed.” This combination of letting go and a faith in intuition may have resulted in a renewed sense of confidence among parents in their own skills. In a global study of more than 5,000 people across the US, UK, France, Germany, India, Singapore, China and Brazil, 61% said they felt much or somewhat more confident in their parenting skills now than before lockdowns.
“Certainly during the pandemic, you could never subcontract out your responsibilities for your children to their teachers or their social groups or anything,” says Tebbey. “It really came down to you as the parents. We’ve seen now that we can play that more active role and be more invested in what our children are going through.” But can parents continue to carve out time, and go gently, as the world around them rapidly speeds up again? “If there’s opportunities for companies and businesses to think creatively about different work weeks or work hours for parents, for families, it’ll benefit everybody,” says Tucci. The Australian Childhood Foundation’s 2020 report A Lasting Legacy: the impact of Covid 19 on children and parents highlights the need for governments at all levels to have “a stronger focus on parental well-being and family functioning”. Support should come in different forms – ranging from online resources to connection with other parents through online communities, to professional advice at times when parents need it. “It’s a potential legacy,” Tucci says. “I don’t think parents did relax our expectations. We broadened our expectations. Now we can appreciate that ability to do stuff that’s just nonsensical, like just putting leaves into piles.” After a rocky start with the move, Asher’s son’s new veggie patch is thriving. And Asher felt their relationship with their son shift. He saw the effort Asher was making with the relocation – the tradies, movers, re-enrolling in school – and began helping. “Unasked. Sometimes bringing in laundry or helping with dishes.” “We grew closer,” says Asher. “I’m not sure if he knew before that he’d always come first no matter what. I think he thought he was part of my whirlwind, but didn’t know he was central to it all.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/05/i-understand-my-kid-more-how-the-pandemic-changed-parenting;5
365;365;5612;5612;‘Extreme marine heatwave’: waters off Sydney set to break January temperature records;2022-01-04T16:30:18Z;['Graham Readfearn'];['Sydney', 'New South Wales', 'Environment', 'Climate crisis', 'Marine life', 'Australia news'];"Waters off Sydney are undergoing an extreme marine heatwave with temperatures likely at their highest levels on record for January. Satellite data is showing the ocean surface off the coast of Sydney at 3C above normal, with swimmers and surfers reporting conditions that feel more like February and March than early January. Prof Moninya Roughan, an oceanographer at the University of New South Wales and an expert in marine heatwaves, said the hottest water was covering an area of about 200sq km.
Roughan is waiting until new data becomes available in the coming weeks from a long-term ocean temperature monitoring station at Port Hacking, where temperatures have been observed since the 1950s. But she said: “It appears now to be reaching those record levels and will likely be the hottest January on record. It’s an extreme marine heatwave.” She said there were three factors behind the extra heat. Global heating was pushing up background temperatures in the ocean, a La Nina weather system was helping transport warmer waters south, and atmospheric conditions were also playing a role. “Marine heatwaves are having severe consequences on ecosystems and they can kill habitats,” she said.
She said the warm belt of water off Sydney was still attached to the East Australian Current – the 100km-wide belt that runs south from the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland to the area off Sydney. She expected a large eddy would break off from the tip of the current and take warmer waters south of Sydney. “I expect that water will hang around and push south over the coming months,” she said.

Prof Rob Harcourt, a marine ecologist at Macquarie University in Sydney, regularly surfs off Sydney beaches. “It’s been over 21C in the water for over a month now. Everyone that surfs has been talking for weeks about how it’s felt more like February and March than December [when the heat started to build].” He said the warmer water was likely bringing bull and tiger sharks into the area and also farther south. Other species would also likely be arriving on the warmer waters.
Harcourt said while some species may benefit from warming oceans, the change in ocean temperatures along the eastern coast of Australia was dramatic. “A lot of animals will do poorly. A lot of animals that live in cooler waters, like seals and sharks, have a habitat that’s shrinking fast and the implications are hard to measure, but it’s likely to be dramatic.” He said in recent weeks whale sharks had been spotted north of Sydney and tiger and great white sharks had been seen feeding off a sperm whale carcass on the state’s far south coast. “Whale sharks do come down the coast but they’re rare,” he said.
He said warm water arriving on the current was nothing new, but this arrival was particularly early and was unusually warm. Research in the journal Nature has found marine heatwaves around the globe are becoming more frequent and are lasting longer. Separate research suggests the southern points of the East Australian Current are also warming faster than the area farther north.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/extreme-marine-heatwave-waters-off-sydney-set-to-break-january-temperature-records;3
366;366;5613;5613;Still Life: 2013’s big-hearted gem is a salute to all the lonely people;2022-01-04T16:30:18Z;['Elizabeth Quinn'];['Still Life', 'Culture', 'Drama films', 'Eddie Marsan', 'Film'];"Still Life is a quiet British film with a mighty heart. Written and directed by Uberto Pasolini (best known as a producer of The Full Monty), it tackles the subject of loneliness with the lightest of touches. John May (Eddie Marsan) is a man who notices. His job at a local London council depends on it: part detective, part chief mourner, it falls on him to track down the next of kin of residents who died intestate and, invariably, alone. Over 22 years, May’s role has expanded to include organising, attending and writing the eulogies for the funerals of his “clients”. He pieces together their lives by observation – a birthday card here, a dent in a pillow there – and creates a life for them in words and music.
Marsan inhabits the role of May with very few words and even fewer gestures. His presence is a stillness in the centre of the camera lens while life in all its noisy chaos goes on around him. Background noise is turned up a notch – traffic, bird song, distant voices – as if to emphasise the quietness of his own life. Marsan himself is probably one of the best character actors you’ve never heard of. Known in the UK for his television and film appearances – including in Mike Leigh’s 2008 feature Happy-Go-Lucky, and in the US for crime drama Ray Donovan – he received the best British actor award at the 2014 Edinburgh international film festival for his portrayal of May, his first role as the romantic lead.
Romance is not a part of May’s daily life. He lives alone in a tidy council flat devoid of any personal touches. He is shocked to learn that his latest client – left for weeks before being found – lived opposite him. “A loner,” says his unsympathetic boss Mr Pratchett (The Crown’s Andrew Buchan). “You know the type.” The death of this fellow loner – William Stoke – affects May more than any of the others. When May is “let go” from his council job shortly after, he asks for more time to arrange a suitable send-off for Stoke. Pratchett grudgingly allows him a few days, unpaid, to complete this last case.
May’s dogged research leads him to an estranged daughter named Kelly (Downton Abbey’s Joanne Froggatt) living in Truro, Cornwall. She too lives alone, and the two strangers share the unspoken empathy of lonely people. They meet up again at a cafe a few days before the funeral to go over the arrangements. Kelly Stoke can hardly fail to be touched by the thoughtfulness of the man sitting across from her. As her train leaves the station, she asks John if he would meet her after the funeral for a cup of tea.
From that moment on, May’s demeanour changes. His blank expression takes on a sweetness bordering on a smile. For the first time, a gentle guitar score can be heard above the now-muted sounds of the train running on its tracks and the cries of children in the park. He is now an active participant in the world that surrounds him, not a passive onlooker. The camerawork in Still Life conveys the loneliness of the main character and that of his “charges” in this dialogue-light film. Its title is reflected in the painterly still shots and vignettes of the empty spaces they leave behind. Small gestures take on a poignancy that makes parts of it almost unbearable to watch. The final controversial scene has divided reviewers and led to accusations that it undoes all the goodwill built up to that point. The sceptical are outraged and the sentimental are moved by it: either way, it’s worth investing the 88 minutes it takes to reach the end of this moving, unpretentious gem of a film.";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/05/still-life-2013s-big-hearted-gem-is-a-salute-to-all-the-lonely-people;1

It’s hard to explain that to the 91-year-old woman who slept in a chair last night in the emergency department I work at. Or the patient with cancer, receiving chemo, stuck at the cancer treatment centre for more than 24 hours, her journey delayed because she had became a close contact while waiting for a bed. Or the patient with suicidal ideation, who has been scheduled under the Mental Health Act, was told they have Covid-19, and is being forced to wait indefinitely for days as there are no beds at the specialised mental health facility. Or the ever-growing number of Covid-positive and suspected Covid-positive patients we are treating in a makeshift tent – literally a tent that has been set up outside the front of the department, as there is no room inside. No, Mr Premier. As a nurse working in an New South Wales emergency department, I can tell you our healthcare system no longer remains strong. After two years of fighting the pandemic, the foundations of our healthcare system have been washed away.
We do not have the capacity to treat the influx of Covid-positive patients. In addition to the Covid patients who require hospitalisation due to the virus, the usual presentations to ED haven’t stopped – there are still all the patients suffering strokes, heart attacks, lacerated hands from broken beer bottles, broken legs from motor vehicle accidents, pregnant women with abdominal pain, children with burns from scalding water – and they all happen to have Covid-19. These patients require treatment in a separated area from the rest of the ED patients to avoid a situation where patients come to hospital and catch Covid-19. This area is over capacity. At times, we have to add additional chairs in the corridor to keep up with the demand. Ambulances have had to wait over an hour to offload their Covid-positive patients as there is simply no room. Despite the influx of patients the nursing ratio does not change, creating an unsafe working environment. We are working with skeleton staff as so many senior colleagues have called it quits after having been worked into the ground over the past 24 months. It has become the norm for us to be asked every shift to do overtime or to come in on our days off. We do it, not for the extra money, but out of guilt and solidarity for our colleagues so they are not left to work a shift with deadly nurse-to-patient ratios. It is not uncommon for shifts to be so short-staffed that they have only one third of the nurses required rostered on. It is not a sustainable work model. Compounding the issue now is the growing number of staff members who themselves are testing positive. Adding to the situation is the issue of the staffing skill mix, which has become dangerous. To scrape through each shift, we are reliant on agency staff or staff being sent from other areas of the hospital to work in areas where they lack the specialised training. It is just not safe. The working conditions in hospitals has deteriorated throughout the pandemic. Beds replaced with chairs to make way for the growing number of patients. Tents erected outside, exposed to the elements, to make additional space to treat the ever-growing number of Covid-confirmed and suspected patients. Nurses having to work outdoors, in over 30-degree heat, in direct sunlight, in blue plastic gowns, gloves, goggles, N95 masks and a face shield. Simple procedures take twice as long and are twice as difficult to complete due to infection control procedures. We feel defeated: we are not able to provide the level of care we could pre-pandemic. What is most wearing, though, is the lack of recognition from our leaders about how hard this pandemic is for the nursing workforce.
Every day of this pandemic, we have been expected to come to work without any additional hazard pay for putting ourselves on the front line of this deadly virus. With this latest wave, we have been begged to cancel our leave and extorted to dig deeper as our “community has needed us now more than ever”. Now we are told that we are exempt from isolating when we become a close contact. Yet when will our politicians care for us? When will our politicians stop calling us “healthcare heroes”, as if we are superheroes able to work through any catastrophe, and stop ignoring our pleas for mandated nurse-to-patient ratios to ensure patient safety, and listen to our request for a fair pay rise following the wage freeze imposed on us in 2020? I worry for my colleagues and the profession that I have grown to love. We have already lost so many of our best senior nurses and paramedics over the past few months due to the fatigue of this pandemic. I just know that with this fourth wave of infections, we are going to lose many, many more. My colleagues and I are beyond fatigued. We feel hopeless, we feel scared. There is nothing left for us to give.

368;368;5615;5615;Heat is on Nick Kyrgios’s critical summer as Australian Open looms | Courtney Walsh;2022-01-04T16:30:18Z;['Courtney Walsh'];['Australian Open 2022', 'Nick Kyrgios', 'Australia sport', 'Australian Open', 'Sport', 'Tennis'];"Nick Kyrgios will arrive in Sydney later this week with a lowly rankings status he has not borne since his stunning breakout performance at Wimbledon back in 2014. The Australian started a summer critical to his ability to retain a place on the main ATP Tour in unfortunate circumstances when forced to withdraw from a tournament in Melbourne on Tuesday.
It means he will slide outside the top 100 for the first time since his run to the Wimbledon quarter-finals as a teenager ranked No 144 eight seasons ago. On a live estimate Kyrgios now sits at 115, but it is possible that will dip further by the next official rankings release on Monday, just a week out from the Australian Open. The 26-year-old cited asthma as the reason for his inability to take to the baseline against Slovakian Alex Molčan at Melbourne Park in an ATP 250 tournament on Tuesday night. “I’m really sorry that I’ve had to pull out from this Melbourne Summer Set event,” he said in a statement. “I have been feeling run down and unwell for four days. I have had several Covid tests over the last few days which all came back negative. I don’t feel 100% so I need to take this week to be ready for Sydney next week.” Melbourne can be a problematic city for asthmatics and breathing issues are not to be trifled with, particularly when the pandemic is raging again in Australia due to the Omicron variant. It is hoped the six-time ATP Tour titlist will be able to take his place as a wildcard in another ATP Tour tournament in Sydney. But there are several ramifications resulting from his withdrawal from the season-opening match. His fans in Melbourne miss an opportunity to see an athlete who, at his peak, is an entertainer blessed with the weapons to trouble any of his peers on the tour. As per his profile, the Canberran had been allotted the prime-time match on Rod Laver Arena despite the all-star card for events being held in Melbourne in the opening week.
Reigning Australian Open champion Naomi Osaka, dual Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and 20-time major winner Rafael Nadal were among the champions in action on Tuesday. But Kyrgios retains box-office appeal, particularly in Australia, and the host broadcaster was clearly keen to showcase the local star in front of the biggest possible audience. It means that unless Kyrgios can find some momentum in Sydney, he will return to Melbourne short of match-fitness following two restricted seasons in 2020 and last year. This could be problematic given the 2015 Australian Open quarter-finalist finds himself in a fight to stay in touch with the top 100, let alone return to it. The right-hander has demonstrated in the past he is more than capable of performing off an interrupted preparation. Despite limited match play leading into the Australian Open last February he was able to make it to the 3rd Round. The former world No. 13 edged talented Frenchman Ugo Humbert, who defeated Daniil Medvedev in an ATP Cup rubber this week, before testing US Open champion Dominic Thiem in an engrossing encounter on his favourite court at Melbourne Park. Kyrgios said recently that he is not motivated by his ranking. Nor, as he has stressed many times, is he driven by a desire to claim a grand slam title. But the Australian’s best tennis has traditionally come on the biggest stages in sport, with the enigmatic right-hander riffing off the energy he can draw from crowds that flock to see him. The problem is he may not feature on those stages for some time, and instead find himself in off-Broadway tournaments around the world, unless he performs well over the next three weeks. The Laver Cup star has 90 ranking points to defend at the Australian Open and should he fail to make a run next week in Sydney, or make at least the 3rd Round at Melbourne Park, Kyrgios will find himself firmly in the rankings wilderness. No matter the talent of a player, being ranked outside the top 100 can be a difficult spot to rebound from, as he will know from the trevails of at least a couple of his close friends on the tour. Andre Agassi managed to do so, using his extraordinary ethic to effectively reignite his career when enjoying stunning success in his 30s, but he is an exception.
Murray, who returned from a career-threatening hip injury in February last year using a protected ranking, is finding it a tougher task. Despite some good signs at times during the 14 singles tournaments he played last year, the Scot was only able to rebuild his ranking to 134 by the end of the 2021 season and was beaten in Melbourne by Facundo Bagnis 6-3 5-7 6-3 in the opening round on Tuesday. Thanasi Kokkinakis, another who showed great promise as a teenager, produced some strong results when playing almost an entire season for the first time in years. Yet the South Australian was only able to improve his ranking to 171 in 2021, in part due to the rankings protections the ATP put in place during the pandemic. While Murray was able to play on the main tour using an injury-protected wildcard and wildcards, Kokkinakis spent much of the season on the secondary Challenger tour. Because of his profile, Kyrgios would also draw sponsors’ invitations to smaller ATP Tour tournaments. But if he is unable to succeed this summer, it is plausible one of Australia’s brighter talents will be forced to qualify for the next grand slam at Roland Garros in late May.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/heat-is-on-nick-kyrgioss-critical-summer-as-australian-open-looms;2
369;369;5616;5616;Australia loses ‘unprecedented’ number of overseas diplomats during pandemic, document reveals;2022-01-04T16:30:17Z;['Daniel Hurst'];['Australian foreign policy', 'Coronavirus', 'Australian politics', 'Freedom of information ', 'Australia news'];"An “unprecedented” number of people have withdrawn from Australia’s overseas diplomatic postings during the pandemic, an internal government document has revealed. At the same time, a drop in the number of Australians travelling abroad “has not led to a reduction in consular cases around the world”, according to the detailed briefing provided to the new head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which was released under freedom of information laws with some pages redacted. Officials also said the department wanted to “tell a more compelling story about its value in delivering government priorities” – a phrase that is likely to be code for ensuring it can win budget battles for extra funding and to avoid budget cuts. Australia already has a smaller diplomatic network than similar countries, the document shows. The 51-page incoming operational brief was prepared for the new secretary, Kathryn Campbell, who took up the post in July. It shows the number of positions at Australian embassies and high commissions has declined in recent years, with Dfat employees on overseas postings dropping from 897 in June 2017 to 833 in June 2020. Dfat reduced the number of positions for locally hired staff at Australia’s 113 overseas missions from 2,419 to 2,106 over the same period.

In an implicit warning against cuts, the document said: “Our global network is smaller than those of comparable economies and, on current number of posts, we are second last in the G20 (Saudi Arabia ranks last) and 20th in the OECD (behind countries such as Belgium, Hungary, Greece and Chile).” The document said Australia was focused on the Pacific, with the opening of new posts in the Marshall Islands, French Polynesia and Niue over the past two years. “In the midst of heightened strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific and an international order under intense stress, a strong diplomatic network is essential for protecting and advancing Australia’s national interest.” The document gives an insight into how the pandemic has “reshaped the department’s operations, both in Australia and across the overseas network”. “The overseas network is under pressure following an unprecedented number of posting withdrawals and declining interest in postings in the Covid-19 environment,” the department told Campbell, the former head of the Department of Social Services. “As at 8 July 2021, 148 staff had terminated their posting early, or withdrawn before deployment, due to Covid-19 related concerns.” As of the same date, there were 40 active Covid cases and 554 recovered cases across all Australian government staff posted abroad, accompanying dependants, locally engaged staff and contractors in the overseas network – a significantly higher number of known cases than the ABC reported in April.
“Extended lockdowns, sustained workload pressures, and limited or no opportunities for respite or travel to Australia, are a feature of many Covid-era postings,” the document said. Workload pressures and a lack of travel options had reduced the use of annual leave, “adding to fatigue and risk of burnout”. The document did not go into detail about the department’s handling of tens of thousands of Australians stranded abroad during the pandemic, although it noted the Australian National Audit Office was investigating the issue, including “our capacity to learn from our response”. It cited the $120m promise in the May 2021 budget to increase Australia’s consular capacity and provide support to vulnerable citizens affected by travel restrictions. Dedicated staffing for consular and crisis response services had increased to 210 staff. “Individual consular cases remain at the pre-pandemic level of about 1,200 cases active (or open) on any given day: comprising approximately 350 welfare cases, 170 deaths, 240 arrests and 240 prisoners. The most sensitive of these cases require careful, daily management.” The consular emergency centre responded to about 7,000 calls, 4,000 emails and hundreds of text messages each month, it said. The department manages 280 active social media accounts globally, with a total of about 4.6 million followers, according to the document. During the pandemic the department scaled up “the provision of regular high-quality social media content” for use by Australian embassies. “The Dfat you are inheriting is very different to that which your predecessor took up in 2016,” the department told Campbell, who took over from career diplomat Frances Adamson, now the South Australian governor.
The document said Dfat was a leader across the Australian public service on gender equality, but analysis of five years of data showed increases in the number of staff who identified as LGBTI or as Indigenous were “starting to flatline”. The number of staff who identified as having a disability had “stagnated” around 3.5%, and the number of employees from non-English-speaking backgrounds had fallen. “As the department responsible for representing Australia to the world, we should reflect the community we represent and the global environment in which we operate,” the document said. Large portions of the section on integrity and fraud control were redacted, but the document said the department faced “changing and increasing risks”, and more than 90% of fraud cases were reported from the development program. A section of the document about freedom of information was also partly redacted, as disclosure would “have a substantial adverse effect on the proper and efficient conduct of the operations of an agency”. The uncensored part noted the department had processed 18% more FOI requests in 2020-21 than the year before, but it was “defending a further 42 decisions before the Information Commissioner, and two complex matters before the court”. Campbell was also given a detailed policy brief, but this was blocked from release on the basis it would damage Australia’s international relations.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/australia-loses-unprecedented-number-of-overseas-diplomats-during-pandemic-document-reveals;1
370;370;5617;5617;Victorian Catholic diocese found vicariously liable for child sexual abuse in landmark ruling;2022-01-04T16:30:17Z;['Christopher Knaus'];['Victoria', 'Catholicism', 'Australia news', 'Religion', 'Law (Australia)', 'Christianity'];"The Catholic church’s failed attempt to argue it was not responsible for a priest’s abuse of a five-year-old, because it took place during after-hours “social” visits, has been slammed as “ruthless” by the survivor and an “affront to common sense” by a judge. Last month the Victorian supreme court handed down a judgment finding the current diocese of Ballarat was vicariously liable for the abuse of the boy, who cannot be named, by Father Bryan Coffey in Port Fairy in the early 1970s. The survivor’s lawyers, Ken Cush & Associates, say the ruling is a landmark win that will help countless others. Coffey abused the boy during pastoral care visits to his home on two occasions in 1971. The critical issue in the case was whether Coffey, an assistant parish priest, could be considered a formal employee of the diocese at the time, thereby making it vicariously liable for his actions.
The church argued that Coffey was not a formal employee and so it could not be held liable for his actions. It also said Coffey’s home visits were “social outings” not connected to his work for the church. The judge in the case, Justice Jack Forrest, described the suggestion as “sheer nonsense”. “It is, in my view, both inconceivable and an affront to common sense to suggest (as the Diocese put it) that these visits to parishioners’ houses and [the survivor’s] home were unconnected with Coffey’s pastoral role within the Church and merely social outings separate to his role as an assistant priest,” he said. The court found the abuse occurred and that the diocese was vicariously liable for Coffey’s actions. Forrest found Coffey was not a formal employee of the church, given the absence of any formal employment contract or arrangement, and the lack of immediate control or supervision by the diocese of his work. But he found the diocese was still vicariously liable for the abuse due to the close nature of the relationship between the bishop, the diocese and the Catholic community in Port Fairy; the diocese’s general control over Coffey’s role and duties; and the fact that Coffey had a pastoral role in the town, which included home visits. The court found the relationship between the survivor, his family, Coffey, and the diocese was one of “intimacy and imported trust in the authority of Christ’s representative, personified by Coffey”. “I am also satisfied that Coffey’s role as a priest under the direction of the Diocese placed him in a position of power and intimacy vis-à-vis [the survivor] that enabled him to take advantage of [the survivor] when alone – just as he did with other boys,” he said. Forrest found that the survivor had failed to prove negligence on the part of the diocese, given there was no evidence it had any actual knowledge of Coffey’s misconduct or any evidence that would lead to an inference that the diocese should have known of Coffey’s proclivities. The court awarded the survivor $230,000. In an interview with Guardian Australia, the survivor said the church’s approach to the case had caused him significant distress. “They weren’t giving anything away,” he said. “They wanted to drag me through it, and they dragged me through it.” He had been cross-examined for three days and forced to relive painful memories, including the sudden death of both of his parents in a car crash in 1985, in a way he thought was irrelevant to the case. The argument that the home visits were not connected to Coffey’s work as a priest, the survivor said, was “ruthless”.
“That really upset me, because you know, I was always brought up that a priest is a priest, 24 hours a day,” he said. “We always had priests and nuns visit the house, and the nuns were never out of their habits when they came to the house. The priest was never out of his clerical tie when he visited the house. “They just tried to argue their way out of it.” A Ken Cush & Associates special counsel, Sangeeta Sharmin, said the ruling, for the first time, provided a binding authority that allowed a diocese to be held vicariously liable for the abuse conducted by its priests. “This verdict, along with the courage our client has shown in fighting for the rights of that five-year-old version of himself, will help countless other victims of church abuse in the future,” she said. “As it should be, because dioceses need to take responsibility for the men they placed in these communities, asked their congregations and donors to trust, and who people looked to for spiritual guidance.

“The argument will no longer be able to be used as a shield by Catholic institutions, and our efforts in striving to give abuse victims a voice has finally culminated in this landmark decision.” The church and the office of the current Bishop for Ballarat, Paul Bird, were contacted for a response. It is unclear whether the church will appeal. • In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800, or Bravehearts on 1800 272 831, and adult survivors can contact Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380.

371;371;5618;5618;Scott Morrison opposes free rapid antigen tests. But here’s what other countries are doing;2022-01-04T16:30:17Z;['Luke Henriques-Gomes'];['Health', 'Coronavirus', 'Scott Morrison', 'Australia news'];"This week, Scott Morrison insisted the provision of rapid antigen tests for those without symptoms or who have not been told to get tested by authorities should be left to the “private market”. Having referred to what he called more “casual uses” of rapid tests, the prime minister said: “We’re at another stage of this pandemic now where we just can’t go round and make everything free.” While some state governments – principally New South Wales and Victoria – last week said they wanted to distribute rapid antigen tests free to the general public, they later watered down these commitments.
However, some governments overseas have taken a very different approach when it comes to rapid tests. Here are some examples. United Kingdom Perhaps the best known example to most Australians, the UK government offers people access to free self-administered rapid antigen tests through the National Health Service. They are provided free through local pharmacies, with residents able to obtain a “collect code” and then pick them up. Individuals can also grab two packs of seven rapid tests from community locations such as libraries. And they can also be ordered through a home delivery service. The NHS website notes people might wish to do a free test when they “mix with people in crowded indoor places” or “visit someone who is at higher risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-19”. These are examples of what the Australian government views as “casual uses” for such tests. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Some Australians in the UK have noted the contrast between the two systems. “It’s been so good that they’re free,” says Jordan Marshall, an Australian living in London. “My partner’s a paramedic so we’ve been quite proactive about testing.” Marshall says she’s probably used about 20 rapid tests over about three months, with many of those in the lead up to Christmas. “While there’s been supply issues, the fact that we can get boxes delivered to the house means you can have greater level of confidence you’re not out there spreading it in the community,” she says.
Singapore The Singaporean government sent households 10 free rapid antigen tests in the mail between October and December. It undertook a similar process, providing six tests per household, between August and September. The government also has a program that offers free rapid testing kits to employers, who then provide them to workers. By October, 11,000 businesses had signed up, reports the Straits Times. Tests that are sold at retailers are also now considerably cheaper than those currently on offer in Australia, where tests had cost between $10 and $15 each, but have since exploded to as much as $30 to $40 a pop in some cases. From 10 December, it was reported that Singaporean retailers were stocking “Flowflex” tests at $5 each, while a pack of five cost $24.
Malaysia Home rapid test kits are considered a “controlled item” in Malaysia and supply is controlled by the government. They are sold at pharmacies with a capped price of $6.60, though they are often cheaper than that. Aliya Ahmad, a Pakistani Australian visiting her parents who live in Malaysia, says tests tend to cost between $2 and $6 each. “The pharmacies and chemists are all over the place, at least in the city where I live,” Ahmad says. “Also, while I can only really speak for what I’ve been observing myself, it seems like general practice to take one before going to a big gathering or a house with elders.”
France Since late last month, France has made self-administered rapid tests available at supermarkets. They are subject to price controls, meaning they cannot cost more than $8 per test. The government urged residents to use the tests before New Year’s Eve celebrations.
Portugal Rapid antigen tests administered in pharmacies are free. Citizens can obtain four of these tests per month, though this was expanded to six tests in December during the lead up to Christmas. Self-administered rapid antigen test kits are also available in shops, generally for about $4-6 per test. A negative rapid test is required to enter some venues throughout Portugal.
Canada Some Canadian provinces, such as Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan, have offered free rapid tests through local distribution centres. In the case of Nova Scotia, 400,000 tests were reportedly handed out in December through local libraries (the population is about 970,000), though the initiative concluded late last month. Ontario, home to Toronto, is offering a free take-home rapid test to residents as part of a holiday testing blitz that will last into this month. The federal government also has a program offering free rapid tests to businesses. Germany Germany offers free rapid antigen tests once a week at testing centres. Self-administered take-home kits are also available at pharmacies and, according to Bloomberg, were on sale for as little as about $2.50 in November. United States The US has been hit by a shortage of rapid tests in many places and costs are broadly comparable with Australia. In some cities, free tests are available to the general public for pick up, subject to supply. For example, Washington DC residents can pick up a free home rapid test from local schools.
The Biden administration intends to distribute 500m rapid test kits free of charge to people to use at home. It’s expected the tests will be sent out from this month. Free doesn’t always mean available It should be noted that, like Australia, many of these countries have been hit by supply shortages. The Guardian reported that the UK’s free rapid tests system has been hit by supply issues that frustrated residents over the holiday period. And, unlike some other countries, high-quality PCR tests do remain free in Australia, though the government is now trying to limit them to people who are symptomatic or high-risk close contacts. With the Australian system under massive pressure, it has become incredibly hard to get a test and some results are taking as long as five days to come back. National cabinet is expected to determine concessional arrangements that might give some Australians access to cheaper rapid antigen tests on Wednesday. Some states are also set to provide more details about their plans to distribute some free rapid tests, though these will likely only apply to certain vulnerable groups.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/scott-morrison-opposes-free-rapid-antigen-tests-but-heres-what-other-countries-are-doing;7
372;372;5619;5619;Plan for new Indigenous cultural precinct in Canberra unveiled by Morrison government;2022-01-04T16:30:17Z;['Sarah Martin'];['Indigenous Australians', 'Australian politics', 'Coalition', 'Canberra', 'Australia news'];"The federal government has pledged $316.5m for a new Indigenous cultural precinct in Canberra that would include a long-awaited national resting place for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ancestral remains. The proposed centre, to be called Ngurra, which means home, country or place of belonging in different Aboriginal languages, will incorporate a learning and knowledge centre and the relocated Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (Aiatsis). It will be built on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin on Ngunnawal country in Canberra within the parliamentary triangle that includes other prominent national institutions.
The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the centre would become a “place of national pride and significance” and hailed its proposed location as demonstrating the “importance and reverence this institution should hold”. “Ngurra is the realisation of a long-held desire to have a home for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and histories at the heart of our nation,” Morrison said. “It will be a national landmark of the highest order, standing proudly for us all to celebrate, educate, reflect and commemorate.” A national resting place for ancestral remains was formally recommended to government in 2014 when an advisory committee for Indigenous repatriation completed the national resting place consultation report. Two parliamentary committees have since endorsed the recommendation. The project, which underwent a $4.7m business case process after the May budget, would be built “fully in accordance” with the proposal developed by Aiatsis. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
The Aiatsis chief executive, Craig Ritchie, said he was “super excited” the project was going ahead and he hoped work could begin by the end of the year. He said the aspiration of the precinct was to shift the story of Indigenous Australia away from a focus on disadvantage to one that highlighted the “richness of our cultures, the sophistication of our world views and its relationship to country and place”. “There is a deeply ingrained way of thinking about Indigenous Australia that is defined by disadvantage, and that challenge is real, but it is not who we are,” Ritchie told Guardian Australia. “We wanted the opportunity to do more than just recite grievances, but really showcase the brilliance of First Nations cultures in a way … that all Australians have access to.”
Morrison said the centre would give Australians and international visitors “a deeper appreciation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ diversity and cultures, and the richness this offers our country”. “This new world-class facility will contribute to our continuing journey of reconciliation, where Indigenous Australians can tell their stories, in the way they want, for all visitors to have a greater understanding of our shared history,” the prime minister said. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said the new learning and engagement centre – and the exhibitions, research and curation that would occur at Ngurra – would result in “significant acts of truth-telling”.
“At its heart will be a national resting place where the remains of Indigenous Australians taken from their country will be cared for until they are able to be returned to their communities,” Wyatt said. “In instances where provenance has been forgotten or erased, they will be cared for in perpetuity with dignity and respect.” The relocation of Aiatsis, which has spearheaded the project, will also make accessible the world’s largest collection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural and heritage items. “Ngurra will provide a new perspective on our shared history, as a significant moment for truth-telling, and a new place where the diversity of Indigenous Australia and one of the world’s oldest living cultures will be celebrated,” the minister said. The earmarked site is on Commonwealth Place on the primary axis in the parliamentary triangle – between Old Parliament House and the Australian War Memorial. An architectural design competition will be held to find an “iconic design” that “reflects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ aspirations, achievements and deep connection to country”.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/plan-for-new-indigenous-cultural-precinct-in-canberra-unveiled-by-morrison-government;1
373;373;5620;5620;Light at end of tunnel ‘a fricking train’: regional ICU nurses curse lack of staff during surge in Covid cases;2022-01-04T16:30:17Z;['Peter Hannam'];['New South Wales', 'Australia news', 'Health', 'Coronavirus'];"Hospitals workers in New South Wales have vented their anger at being left on the frontline with seriously depleted levels of staffing amid a major surge in Covid cases, as nurse-to-patient ratios are cut and others face shortages on their intensive care wards. “The light at the end of a tunnel is a fricking train at the moment,” said Gil Wilson, a senior nurse at the Lismore Base hospital and a NSW Nurses and Midwives Association delegate. “We can’t see an end to this.”
The regional hospital, which serves a large area of northern NSW as the main Covid treatment centre, recently added an 18-bed intensive care unit. Staffing levels, though, didn’t increase in tandem. “Why didn’t we change it to be able to be staffed to be able to take, say, 10 or 12 ventilated patients?” Wilson, who has worked as a nurse for 32 years, said. “Now we’re only staffed to take four and that’s why I’m going into pulling an extra shift this afternoon.” Northern NSW includes some of the state’s anti-vaccination pockets. The Byron Bay region, for instance, was only about 85% double vaccinated as of 20 December, among the lowest rates in the state, according to federal government statistics. ICU nursing requires skills that can’t be whipped up “with a couple of days’ training”, Wilson said. Such nurses “operate the machine that’ll breathe for you, they calibrate the machine so it can replace your kidneys, they can operate multiple drug infusions to keep your heart and other organs functioning, and monitor you the whole time”. Covid has also made life harder for staff, who have to don full personal protective equipment “sweating your arse off for a full eight-hour shift”, he said, adding “it requires a great deal of effort to turn somebody who has a breathing tube in and a heap of other tubes”.
On Tuesday, NSW set a record for daily cases with 23,131 new infections reported – almost 28% of those who came forward for testing in the previous 24-period. Those in hospital with Covid jumped 16% on the previous day, to 1,344, while those in ICU rose almost 10% to 104, the state government said. Hospital staff said that existing service levels were barely meeting current needs even before an expected spike in new hospitalisations in the coming weeks. The NSW health department was approached for comment. At Sydney’s Royal Prince Alfred hospital, as many as seven ambulances were lined up at the emergency department on Tuesday afternoon, with a makeshift tent providing cover for an overflow of about a dozen would-be patients. “It’s going smoothly,” one security guard said. “The tent is for priority patients.” Hospital staff, though, declined to comment directly to Guardian Australia. “Not interested,” said one hospital worker when approached. “I’m in a hurry.” A NSW Health spokesperson said the department had more than 140,000 staff, and that since 2011 it had increased the workforce by almost 25,000 full-time equivalent staff, with a further 8,300 full-time workers to be added.
“All local health districts have well-developed workforce surge and demand management plans in place, and our networked hospital system ensures patients can be transferred or redirected to other hospitals where necessary, including private hospitals,” the spokesperson said. The Northern NSW district had “sufficient intensive care beds across the three major hospitals in Grafton, Lismore and Tweed, with plans in place to surge staffing and ICU capacity, if and when required”. Michelle Rosentreter, an ICU nurse at another major metropolitan Sydney hospital and also a NSW Nurses and Midwives Association delegate, said emergency departments had become the “Covid frontline”. “We would argue that the frontline is actually your GPs and their community testing clinics, access to free rapid antigen tests or PCR testing,” Rosentreter said. “As they start to close down – which is what the government is doing because it’s obviously costing them too much money to look after public health – those consumers come in directly to the emergency departments. “That’s putting an incredibly big strain on our hospitals because our workforce is significantly reduced. We don’t have the capacity to constantly treat these numbers.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Ideally, one nurse should serve three emergency department beds at most, with as many as 20 patients processed per shift. “At the moment, it’s one [nurse] to 10, one to 20 [beds]” at Rosentreter’s hospital. Rosentreter has herself been waiting for five days for the results of a PCR test to be returned after her daughter – also a nurse – contracted Covid. Staff who are not showing symptoms have been recalled to work but there remains “a huge risk” they will infect others, whether patients or staff, she said. “There’s no setup in the workplace for them to remove the mask in order to have a drink of water or have something to eat,” she said. “So basically, you do your whole shift and avoid everybody, keeping on your PPE.” While the health system had some surge capacity, in order to cope with winter flu outbreaks, there had been insufficient investment for a long period, she said. “Our political leaders always told us we have a very robust, healthy and well-ranked health system. But in reality, it has been a system over the years, pre-pandemic, that has been grossly under-resourced with shackles on recruitment and budgets. “We’re looking at the real face of burnout now.

375;375;5622;5622;The Bored Ape NFT craze is all about ego and money, not art;2022-01-04T16:16:51Z;['Jonathan Jones'];['Art and design', 'Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)', 'Digital art', 'Cryptocurrencies', 'Eminem', 'Culture', 'E-commerce', 'Internet', 'Blockchain'];"Bored Ape #79 looks almost as bored as I feel when I think about NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and their supposedly seismic impact on art. My jaw slides, my eyelids hang down and I want to pick lice from my fur. Even though I can identify with Bored Ape #79, I won’t be buying it, unlike Eminem who has bought another in this highly fashionable NFT “art” brand that looks slightly like him. It’s called EminApe and sports a military-urban peaked cap above its enervated face. He reportedly paid around $450,000 (£334,000) for it. Just in case, like me, you have spent the last year averting your gaze with a sigh whenever another news item about NFT art wafted an unmistakable aroma of bull your way, here is a quick reminder of what Eminem gets for his near half-million – which, by the way, is far from the highest anyone has paid for one of these nihilist monkeys. He owns a unique unit of data recorded in a digital blockchain, which permanently records its provenance or sales history. It’s a way of restoring the idea of an “original” one-off artwork to the endlessly reproducible, copyable realm of the internet. Anyone can grab Eminem’s ape image online, but he owns the “original” and has the blockchain provenance to prove it.
Someone was going to monetise digital culture eventually. And theoretically, from an artist’s point of view, that has to be a good thing – right? Suddenly, creators don’t have to settle for feeble fees from Spotify or see their images circulate free of charge. They can clean up. Rags to riches stories have helped to make the NFT art market the sentimental bag of air it is. Struggling unknowns find themselves selling NFTs for wildly escalating prices, outsiders who never got near success in the established art world suddenly leap to fame, and the art world, never slow to jump on a bandwagon, has joined in the fun with Christie’s selling a JPEG file by Beeple for $69m last spring. The Bored Ape boom, however, should put an end to any romanticism about NFT art. It puts the consumer experience first and has absolutely nothing to do with empowering artists. It’s all about the collector’s ego. For Eminem doesn’t just get a “unique” masterpiece of digital “art” for his money. Purchasers of an NFT from the Bored Ape collection also become members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, a “swamp club for apes” where the cool dudes who fork out heaps of cryptocurrency for a monkey cartoon can hang out together. This is part of the well-planned strategy that is making Bored Apes a marketing sensation – and a mockery of all the inflated claims uncritically spouted about NFT art. The Bored Ape Yacht Club could even be a satire on the NFT craze, were it not such a lucrative example of it. This is a totally cynical creation. The Club offers a new level of exclusivity, a virtual social club, on top of its promise of exclusive digital ownership. It seems the kind of fake cool meeting of pop culture and money that might attract the insecure Kendall Roy in the TV drama Succession – “Bored Apes are cool, right? Yeah they’re cool. See you in the Yacht Club to dish out more stuff on my dad!” Yet real-life celebrities are queuing up to join including Jimmy Fallon and rapper Post Malone. If they get bored posting graffiti in the club toilet (this is one of the perks) they can purchase a “serum” that allows them to remix ape designs to produce a Mutant Ape. It’s all so neatly designed, so smoothly negotiable, so stylishly moronic, it makes the early (as in, early 2021) NFT art sensations look frightfully naive. The anonymous inventors of the Bored Ape were two literary loafers – they claim to have bonded over the novels of David Foster Wallace – who then hired a graphic designer to create the ape design. The Bored Apes are framed as portraits in an ironic nod to high art. But they’re not art of any bite or originality. The ape is a very ordinary and derivative bit of comic book design, heavily indebted to inspirations ranging from Jamie Hewlett to Rick and Morty. It isn’t art that’s being sold here but attitude. The attitude says it all. Bored, emptied out, wrecked, and proud of it. That’s how the NFT art investors all feel, apparently. And so they should. NFTs are not good for art. They are not liberating for artists. Instead, as the Bored Ape Yacht Club makes horribly obvious, they serve nothing but money. They are just simian poker chips that celebrate the thrill of the market. A purer form of capitalism has never existed.";https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/04/bored-ape-nft-art-eminem;5
376;376;5623;5623;Sadiq Khan plans pilot to ‘decriminalise’ minor cannabis offences in London;2022-01-04T16:03:21Z;['Jessica Elgot'];['Drugs', 'Cannabis', 'London', 'Sadiq Khan', 'Metropolitan police', 'Police', 'Politics', 'Society', 'UK news', 'Local government', 'City mayors'];Downing Street has expressed concern over moves to end the prosecution of young people caught with cannabis in some London boroughs, under a pilot scheme being developed by Sadiq Khan. The mayor of London is understood to be developing a plan based on a successful model from Thames Valley police that would offer classes or counselling, rather than arrest, to under-25s caught with small quantities of cannabis. Khan’s office said the plans for three boroughs to trial the approach were still in development and that they did not have the powers to fully decriminalise any drugs. The pilot is yet to receive approval from the mayor’s office for policing and crime. Both Downing Street and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said they did not endorse any further decriminalisation of drugs. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said illegal drugs “destroy lives and fuel violence”. The spokesman said: “We have absolutely no intention of decriminalising dangerous and harmful substances for recreational use. Decriminalisation would leave organised criminals in control, while risking an increase in drug use, which drives crime and violence which blights our streets.” Starmer said of the plans, first reported by the Telegraph, that he would not endorse any changes to the law. “I’m not in favour of us changing the law or decriminalisation. I’m very clear about that,” he said. He added he would “look at” the pilot Khan was proposing, “but I’m very clear that we’re not in favour of changing the drugs laws.” A spokesman for the mayor of London said: “This limited trial, which is still in development and has yet to be approved by City Hall, would involve three of London’s 32 boroughs and would only apply to 18 to 24-year-olds found in possession of a small amount of cannabis. It would not apply to any other drug. “The idea of the scheme, which is already used by other police forces across the country, would be to divert young people who are found with a small amount of cannabis away from the criminal justice system and instead provide help and support. This has been shown to reduce reoffending. “Reducing crime is the mayor’s top priority and he will continue to explore and implement the most effective solutions to help to divert young people away from drug use and crime for good.” New approaches to tackling illegal drug use has been a priority for Khan’s second term in office. He has commissioned a review by independent experts into the feasibility of decriminalising cannabis. Though he has no powers to change their status legally, he is expected to give a mayoral endorsement to any proposals from the review, including full decriminalisation if that is recommended, which would be likely to spark a wider conversation. The commission is examining how countries around the world have tackled problems with drug use and addiction, including looking at evidence from Portugal, where possession and consumption of drugs have been decriminalised since 2001. The mayor will receive recommendations for City Hall, the government, the police, the criminal justice system, and NHS and treatment services. The illegal drug trade in the UK is estimated to cost society £19bn per year, according to the mayor’s office. About 41,900 people across England and Wales were charged with drug-related offences last year.;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/04/sadiq-khan-plans-pilot-to-decriminalise-minor-cannabis-offences;1
377;377;5624;5624;The Fiver | Manchester United tribute act Manchester United are in a deep funk;2022-01-04T16:02:03Z;['Scott Murray'];['Football', 'Sport', 'Manchester United', 'Wolverhampton Wanderers'];"MEET THE NEW BOSS, SAME AS THE OLD BOSS? The Fiver was in a state of suspended animation during the Christmas break, a bit like Percy Pig but in reverse. But now we’re back, baby! And we’re back, baby, just in time to report that everything is pretty much exactly the same as it was before. Manchester City are still a shoo-in for the league. Norwich remain near-certainties to go down. And the stuff being served up at Old Trafford would make a Goodison season-ticket holder reconsider complaining about the fare Rafa’s slopping in front of them. Context, you see. There’s always somebody worse off than you.
Yesterday evening, Manchester United tribute act Manchester United really excelled themselves with a performance of such abject poverty that comparisons were instantly drawn with those Late Solskjærian fiascos, only this time there was even less hope. A miserable state of affairs, given the club had added some fresh new hope only last month with the appointment of Ralf Rangnick. But hope is a nebulous concept, quickly evaporating if it doesn’t catch alight, and now look where everyone is. In a deep funk, only five games into the new manager’s reign, is where everyone is. Which doesn’t exactly seem fair, but Big Cup qualification is looking far from a given, and this is the impatient way of super-club football in the modern world. Oh Ralf! How could you! “If I say we are 100% convinced we will finish in the top four, I don’t know if people will believe that,” Rangnick correctly stated after the match, an observation designed to prove his comprehension skills to sceptical fans who’d earlier loudly booed his substitution of Mason Greenwood with 2020’s Bruno Fernandes. Luke Shaw went one step further in telling it like it is, by claiming he “didn’t think we were all there together”, suggesting the squad are seriously missing a Roy Keane figure who would give those dragging their feet a proper what-for, and issue beneficial advice while he was doing it. To be scrupulously fair, the Bootleg Red Devils didn’t do a great deal of conspicuous moaning about all the misplaced passes last night, which is an improvement of sorts, in that it at least saves some emotional energy. But there were few other plus points, as Wolverhampton wandered around Old Trafford with the sort of assured superiority not seen from them since the days of Stan Cullis, or at least 1980, which is when they last won there. Phil Jones was impressive, even if his clearing header led directly to João Moutinho’s winner, but if someone who hasn’t featured for 708 matches turns out to be your star man, you can be sure things aren’t running quite as smoothly as you’d ideally like. Oh Phil! Oh Ralf! Oh Ole! Oh José! Oh Louis! Oh David! How could etc. QUOTE OF THE DAY “I had hoped to rediscover the joy in playing football but it was not to be, as I don’t feel comfortable in the world of football. I don’t want to be part of it any longer. I will take time to discover what my interests are and what I will take up” – Former Brighton midfielder Davy Pröpper announces his retirement from football, aged 30, having “lost the love of the game” only six months after returning to join PSV.

While a lot of people have spent the past few weeks trying to do as little as possible, it has been go-go-go for the Trump family. Donald, Ivanka and Donald Jr have been issued with subpoenas as part of a fraud inquiry into the family’s businesses. Melania, meanwhile, has been busy building a business of her own. The former first lady, turned crypto queen, has jumped on the non-fungible token (NFT) trend: last month she was flogging a digital painting of her eyes titled Melania’s Vision (and promising an unspecified portion of the proceeds from her digital ventures would go to children ageing out of foster care). The price? One SOL (Solana, the cryptocurrency, is worth about £128). Now, she has released a picture of herself dressed in white for a starting bid of just 1,415.86 SOL (£180,000). Melania’s NFT venture isn’t her first brush with entrepreneurship. She had a jewellery line and once developed a skincare range called Melania Trump’s Caviar Complexe C6™ with Lipid Matrix Receptor™ Technology. She tested her caviar creams on her then seven-year-old son Barron (“It smells very, very fresh … He likes it!” Melania told reporters at the time). Alas, no one else got a chance to use them due to a complicated lawsuit that killed the product before it got to the shops. Will the NFT project fare better? I don’t know how many SOLs Melania has collected so far, but she has certainly generated a lot of WTFs. “This is not exactly using her platform for larger global or domestic impact,” one former White House official complained to CNN. “This is ostensibly a quick moneymaker.” Rubbish: it is obviously a quick moneymaker. But I don’t really care, do you? I reckon it is better for everyone if Melania spends her time flogging digital art and tweeting about bitcoin (which is how she spent her Monday). At least she isn’t trying to make a “global impact” via some charitable foundation that could be a veiled tax-avoidance scheme. The world has been affected enough by the Trumps, thank you very much. •Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/melanias-latest-nft-is-selling-for-180000-at-last-one-of-the-trumps-is-showing-entrepreneurial-spirit;5
379;379;5626;5626;Schools in England may suspend certain subjects to cope with Covid;2022-01-04T15:54:21Z;['Sally Weale'];['Schools', 'Primary schools', 'Coronavirus', 'Education', 'Health', 'England', 'Education policy', 'Department for Education'];"Schools in England could suspend the teaching of specialist subjects such as music as part of emergency timetable changes to cope with soaring Covid-related absence rates among staff, headteachers have been advised. As the new term got under way, most primary schools managed to reopen, but some heads reported difficulties as a result of sick staff and pupils having to isolate, and warned that the situation could deteriorate fast.
In secondary schools, mass Covid testing is under way as part of a staggered return for pupils over the next few days. Parents at some schools, however, have already been advised their children will move to online lessons because of a shortage of staff due to sickness. Head teachers raised concerns about the supply of lateral flow tests after an email from the Department for Education (DfE) received on Tuesday morning said orders for additional tests should be placed by 5pm the same day in order to secure deliveries next week. If placed after 5pm, they would be not delivered until the following week, starting 17 January . Secondary schools have been asked to carry out on-site tests of pupils initially, after which pupils and staff are required to test at home twice a week to try to limit the spread of the virus in schools. “Given that some schools haven’t gone back and others have only returned today it’s very short notice,” said one head teacher. “We’re OK for tests at the moment, but this is the fastest turn around yet.” The DfE said schools were asked to place orders ahead of Christmas and 31m tests were delivered to education settings in the final weeks of last term. A further 17.6m kits will be delivered by the end of next week and schools can request emergency supplies if required. Earlier this week, the department suggested that headteachers, faced with high levels of staff absence, should combine classes and teach in larger groups in order to keep children in school. It has now emerged that heads might also consider temporarily suspending the teaching of specialist subjects including music and relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) in order to free up staff for other teaching, according to a Tes report. Ian Bauckham, who chairs the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) and is also chief executive and director of the Tenax Schools Trust, outlined the proposal as part of a “case study” on a DfE portal for headteachers, seen by Tes. While high absence levels can be managed to a certain degree, Bauckham wrote, “a point is also reached where resources can be stretched too thinly and alternatives, however undesirable, become necessary”. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said any such move would depend on absence rates. “It is likely that where schools are experiencing particularly severe shortages of staff they will need to take other action such as combining classes or sending home classes or year groups to learn remotely for short periods of time.” Parklands high school in Chorley, Lancashire, is one of a number of schools to move to blended learning this week because of staff off sick. A statement from the school reported in local media said: “Unfortunately, due to an increase in staff absence due to Covid, we have had to take the difficult decision to revert to blended learning, with one year group working from home each day this week.” Bauckham and the DfE have been approached for comment.";https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/04/schools-in-england-may-suspend-certain-subjects-to-cope-with-covid;2
380;380;5627;5627;Southampton confirm takeover involving Serb magnate Dragan Solak;2022-01-04T15:50:33Z;['Ben Fisher'];['Southampton', 'Business', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Southampton have been taken over by a consortium backed by the Serbian media magnate Dragan Solak that plans to make the Premier League club a cornerstone of a Red Bull-style portfolio of teams across the world. Solak, the founder of the United Group, a telecoms and media provider in south-east Europe, is the lead investor in a deal completed by a company co-founded by the former Brentford co-director of football Rasmus Ankersen.
Ankersen left Brentford and his post as the executive chairman of the Danish club FC Midtjylland in December to set up the sports investment firm Sport Republic, which has bought a controlling 80% stake in Southampton. Solak has partnered the Danish investors Ankersen and Henrik Kraft with the aim of purchasing more clubs in a model similar to the one employed by the owners of Manchester City, RB Leipzig – where the Southampton manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, worked previously – and Barnsley. Kraft said they planned to be active owners but “will not be starting any revolutions”. Solak described the acquisition of Southampton as the “first step towards execution of our investment strategy”. He said: “My partners and I have experience in long-term investments in the sports and entertainment industry and Sport Republic has been founded to combine this expertise and deliver something unique to the market. Southampton will be a cornerstone of the organisation we plan to build.” Ankersen and Kraft, who has spent the past 20 years in the technology industry, are expected to be on Southampton’s board. Sport Republic aims to apply “proprietary intelligence and data analytics to help sports businesses and sports technology companies reach their full potential”. Ankersen was an integral part of Brentford’s impressive rise to the Premier League, implementing a data-driven recruitment strategy. The takeover marks the end of the reign of Gao Jisheng, after almost four and a half years as the majority shareholder. Gao bought an 80% stake for about £200m in August 2017. The Chinese businessman has been keen to sell for the past 18 months, only for interested parties to withdraw. His investment in the club has been extremely limited but Hasenhüttl has repeatedly steered the team away from relegation.
The former majority owner, Katharina Liebherr, retains her 20% stake and the chief executive, Martin Semmens, will remain in post and continue to oversee the day‑to‑day running of the club. Liebherr, her advisers, Semmens and the managing director, Toby Steele, oversaw the takeover process. Southampton, who visit Swansea in the FA Cup third round on Saturday, are 14th in the Premier League. The first league game of the new era will, neatly, be against Brentford next Tuesday. Semmens said Southampton had found the “perfect solution” for the club. “Sport Republic is being built to provide a network of people, clubs and technology that allows the clubs within it to grow every day and gain the advantages you need to be successful,” he said. “As a club, we have never wanted to buy success but to earn it.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/southampton-takeover-serb-media-magnate-dragan-solak;2
381;381;5628;5628;Watching Don’t Look Up made me see my whole life of campaigning flash before me | George Monbiot ;2022-01-04T15:48:03Z;['George Monbiot'];"['Climate crisis', ""Don't Look Up"", 'Environment', 'Media', 'Film', 'Culture']";"No wonder journalists have slated it. They’ve produced a hundred excuses not to watch the climate breakdown satire Don’t Look Up: it’s “blunt”, it’s “shrill”, it’s “smug”. But they will not name the real problem: it’s about them. The movie is, in my view, a powerful demolition of the grotesque failures of public life. And the sector whose failures are most brutally exposed is the media. While the film is fast and funny, for me, as for many environmental activists and climate scientists, it seemed all too real. I felt as if I were watching my adult life flash past me. As the scientists in the film, trying to draw attention to the approach of a planet-killing comet, bashed their heads against the Great Wall of Denial erected by the media and sought to reach politicians with 10-second attention spans, all the anger and frustration and desperation I’ve felt over the years boiled over. Above all, when the scientist who had discovered the comet was pushed to the bottom of the schedule by fatuous celebrity gossip on a morning TV show and erupted in fury, I was reminded of my own mortifying loss of control on Good Morning Britain in November. It was soon after the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow, where we had seen the least serious of all governments (the UK was hosting the talks) failing to rise to the most serious of all issues. I tried, for the thousandth time, to explain what we are facing, and suddenly couldn’t hold it in any longer. I burst into tears on live TV. I still feel deeply embarrassed about it. The response on social media, like the response to the scientist in the film, was vituperative and vicious. I was faking. I was hysterical. I was mentally ill. But, knowing where we are and what we face, seeing the indifference of those who wield power, seeing how our existential crisis has been marginalised in favour of trivia and frivolity, I now realise that there would be something wrong with me if I hadn’t lost it.
In fighting any great harm, in any age, we find ourselves confronting the same forces: distraction, denial and delusion. Those seeking to sound the alarm about the gathering collapse of our life-support systems soon hit the barrier that stands between us and the people we are trying to reach, a barrier called the media. With a few notable exceptions, the sector that should facilitate communication thwarts it. It’s not just its individual stupidities that have become inexcusable, such as the platforms repeatedly given to climate deniers. It is the structural stupidity to which the media are committed. It’s the anti-intellectualism, the hostility to new ideas and aversion to complexity. It’s the absence of moral seriousness. It’s the vacuous gossip about celebrities and consumables that takes precedence over the survival of life on Earth. It’s the obsession with generating noise, regardless of signal. It’s the reflexive alignment with the status quo, whatever it may be. It’s the endless promotion of the views of the most selfish and antisocial people, and the exclusion of those who are trying to defend us from catastrophe, on the grounds that they are “worthy”, “extreme” or “mad” (I hear from friends in the BBC that these terms are still used there to describe environmental activists). Even when these merchants of distraction do address the issue, they tend to shut out the experts and interview actors, singers and other celebs instead. The media’s obsession with actors vindicates Guy Debord’s predictions in his book The Society of the Spectacle, published in 1967. Substance is replaced by semblance, as even the most serious issues must now be articulated by people whose work involves adopting someone else’s persona and speaking someone else’s words. Then the same media, having turned them into spokespeople, attack these actors as hypocrites for leading a profligate lifestyle. Similarly, it’s not just the individual failures by governments at Glasgow and elsewhere that have become inexcusable, but the entire framework of negotiations. As crucial Earth systems might be approaching their tipping point, governments still propose to address the issue with tiny increments of action, across decades. It’s as if, in 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed and the global financial system began to sway, governments had announced that they would bail out the banks at the rate of a few million pounds a day between then and 2050. The system would have collapsed 40 years before their programme was complete. Our central, civilisational question, I believe, is this: why do nations scramble to rescue the banks but not the planet? So, as we race towards Earth system collapse, trying to raise the alarm feels like being trapped behind a thick plate of glass. People can see our mouths opening and closing, but they struggle to hear what we are saying. As we frantically bang the glass, we look ever crazier. And feel it. The situation is genuinely maddening. I’ve been working on these issues since I was 22, and full of confidence and hope. I’m about to turn 59, and the confidence is turning to cold fear, the hope to horror. As manufactured indifference ensures that we remain unheard, it becomes ever harder to know how to hold it together. I cry most days now.

382;382;5629;5629;Wordle: why the inventor of the fiendishly addictive online game doesn’t want your money;2022-01-04T15:47:49Z;['N/A'];['Game culture', 'Mobile games', 'Life and style', 'Internet', 'Technology', 'Hobbies', 'World news', 'US news', 'Social media', 'X'];"Name: Wordle. Age: Nearly three months old. Appearance: Thirty empty boxes in six rows; the rest is up to you. What am I supposed to do? Guess the word. What word? That’s for you to find out. Is this some kind of game? Yes, and it’s been hugely popular since just before Christmas. More than 300,000 people play it daily, and even more are talking about it. Which is incredible, given that it only launched in mid-October. How does it work? You take a wild stab at guessing a five-letter word by entering characters in boxes. Colour-coding shows you which letters you have got right, which you got wrong and which are right but in the wrong position. Then you guess again. Sounds simple. I mean, eventually I’m going to figure it out. Not necessarily – if you can’t get it in six tries, you lose. I’ll just start again. Sorry – only one word, and one go, per day. But I want to play now! You’ll just have to wait. And who invented this madness? Reddit software engineer Josh Wardle. Wardle made Wordle? He created it for his partner, who likes word games. That’s nice. Then he put it online. It was slow to take off initially, but in December, Wardle tweaked the game to allow players to share their results (but not the answer) on social media. After that, it exploded. Is that what those mysterious coloured boxes I keep seeing on Twitter are? Yes – they create a certain amount of intrigue. If it’s so addictive, why isn’t he letting people play it all day? Limited availability is part of the attraction. “It’s something that encourages you to spend three minutes a day,” Wardle told the New York Times. “And that’s it. Like, it doesn’t want any more of your time than that.” While I applaud the success of this daily brain exercise, I think he might have a hard time monetising it. He doesn’t want to. Sorry, I’m not sure I understand. “It’s not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs,” says Wardle. “It’s just a game that’s fun.” Yeah, still don’t get it. Wordle is Wardle’s gift to the world. End of story. I smell a conspiracy. Of course you do. Do say: “That’s fine, I didn’t want another go anyway.” Don’t say: “I’ve got an idea for a new game – it’s like Wordle, but with loads of ads.”";https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/04/wordle-why-inventor-of-fiendishly-addictive-online-game-doesnt-want-your-money;5
383;383;5630;5630;Talents of Madonna’s son divide critics after he is revealed as secret artist;2022-01-04T15:09:50Z;['Nadia Khomami'];['Art', 'Madonna', 'Painting', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'Guy Ritchie', 'Music', 'UK news'];"He is a mysterious, up-and-coming artist whose work has been championed by the likes of Madonna and sells for up to five figures. But there were raised eyebrows when it was revealed that “Rhed” was none other than the singer’s eldest son, Rocco Ritchie. The 21-year-old, Madonna’s child with her ex-husband Guy Ritchie, has been said in reports to have quietly established himself as an expressionist painter, with a number of shows at the Tanya Baxter Contemporary gallery in Chelsea, west London, since 2018. But since PageSix unmasked Ritchie, opinion has been divided on whether his success is due to talent or the weight of his parents’ names. That Ritchie is Rhed is hard to argue with. Both are the same age, grew up in identical cities, and attended Central Saint Martins and the Royal Drawing School. In 2020, Madonna and Guy Ritchie even reunited at the Tanya Baxter Contemporary, alongside their partners and children, for a then unnamed exhibition. So what do we know of his work? Rhed uses thickly applied oils and gestural brushstrokes for his depictions of the human form, according to Tanya Baxter, the gallery’s curator.
His inspirations include Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon, Paula Rego and Helmut Newton. While his subjects have “psychological tension”, he balances this by using a colourful palette and “playfully painting looming figures in the middle of the canvas, often set against a monochromatic abstract backdrop”, Baxter says. “Having an eclectic cultural background, with a childhood spent between New York and London, his paintings exude an engaging mixture of innocence and confidence,” she adds. Rhed himself has said he is “fascinated about the inner and outer world, especially where they meet”. The message of his paintings is that there is “beauty in the struggle of life” – more beauty, he is quoted as saying, than when life comes easy. The King’s Road gallery, which has likened Rhed’s work to Jean-Michel Basquiat and Banksy, promotes a number of positive reviews, including from Mervyn Davies, a former chair of the Royal Academy. “Good artists are those that turn energy into something beautiful that resonates with the eye,” Davies says. “Anyone can be a painter, but it is a question of making others think, and provoke feelings.” The arts writer Godfrey Barker called Rhed “an authentic, pure, and undiluted product of the 21st century … Rhed is not yet to be ranked with the Golden Youth who shook the world at Frieze in 1988. But he is to be mentioned in their company. He makes a powerful statement about Anxiety Now and points into the future.”
The Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones was less enthusiastic, suggesting the artist had been put into the public eye too soon. “His paintings are clumsy adolescent efforts with no sign of originality or vigour,” Jones said. “Obviously that doesn’t mean he will not become a better artist with time. Painting takes work. It therefore seems a shame that Rhed has been put into the public eye when he’s just not, at this point, a real artist. These daubs are amateur stuff, vaguely imitating Picasso or Modigliani, that could have been done by a million young people.” The gallery, Jones added, “ought to be ashamed of cynically pushing this unready youngster on the market. They compare him with the street artists Banksy and Basquiat but to be honest, the only street they remind me of is the King’s Road where this kind of bad art is sure to sell to posh fools.” The White Pube, the collaborative identity of arts writers Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad, went further, saying: “It’s a shame when artists create work that looks like modern art instead of contemporary art. These paintings look like AI has scraped Modigliani, fauvism, b-side Picassos, and a more conspicuous Bacon style to create new works that feel old and flat and done. And the dramatic reveal: ‘suspiciously successful kid in art world secretly has incredibly rich famous parents’ isn’t surprising or new, but it is shit.” Rhed’s pieces are listed on Artsy for up to £24,000. Whether or not the world should have allowed Ritchie to continue using a fake name is yet to be determined. The Tanya Baxter Contemporary has been contacted for comment.";https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/04/talents-madonna-son-divide-critics-secret-artist-rocco-ritchie;5
384;384;5631;5631;Preaching truth to power: the São Paulo priest standing up to Bolsonaro;2022-01-04T15:00:15Z;['Beatriz Miranda'];['Jair Bolsonaro', 'Brazil', 'Homelessness', 'Poverty', 'Americas', 'World news', 'Activism'];"In 2017, most Brazilians were still unfamiliar with the name Jair Bolsonaro. But for Júlio Lancellotti, there was already cause for concern in the reactionary rhetoric of the man who would be elected president two years later under the slogan: “Brazil above everything, God above everyone.” “I am astonished that a homophobic person like Bolsonaro appears on the presidential ballot,” said the priest during mass on 7 March of that year at St Michael the Archangel parish in São Paulo’s East Zone. The sermon, in which he also preached against rape culture and sexism, was typical of the man who has devoted his life to fighting injustice, often finding himself targeted by conservative politicians as a result. An openly leftwing priest who embraces revolutionary ideas – the 72-year-old has demonstrated arm-in-arm with anti-establishment “black bloc” protesters and believes hotels should provide free rooms for homeless people – Lancellotti seemingly represents the antithesis of everything Brazil’s president stands for. He was even sued by Bolsonaro for moral damages because of his March 2017 mass (a judge dismissed the claim).
But Lancelloti’s run-in with the authorities began long before Bolsonaro took office. As a novice in the late 1960s, he was expelled from the seminary for “bad behaviour”, as he describes it. He says the seminary where he first studied, in the city of Araraquara, was “very conservative”. His days were marked by censure and abusive punishments. “I was beaten with a bamboo stick, I was forced to kneel on corn grains … one day, a priest said I asked too much in class, that I was very critical. They kicked me out.” After this episode, Lancellotti spent years away from the priesthood. He graduated from a course in education in 1978, started working with juvenile offenders and soon became a thorn in the side of the authorities. “I refused to accept the torture I witnessed against young people. I felt I was being tested all the time by those who were aligned with the government,” he says. It was during these years that Lancellotti met progressive priests who were actively engaged with the children’s rights cause, and in doing so rediscovered a sense that social justice was possible within the Roman Catholic church. He resumed his theological studies and, in 1985, became a priest.
Since 1996, Lancelotti has coordinated the pastoral commission of homeless people in São Paulo, which helps about 35,000 people in the district. He describes being pepper-sprayed, spat at, and punched in the stomach by São Paulo’s municipal guard while helping homeless people in 2018. Lancelotti says the Covid pandemic has worsened the living conditions of São Paulo’s homeless, while the ultra-conservatism of the Bolsonaro era has fuelled what the priest describes as “aporophobia” – a fear and rejection of the poor. In August, São Paulo state deputy Janaína Paschoal praised the military police after they blocked the homeless commission’s access to an inner-city area nicknamed Cracolândia – “Crackland”. Advocating for homeless people is the focus of Lancellotti’s activism, but not its only cause. He does not hesitate to take a stand for controversial groups such as those involved in black bloc tactics at demonstrations. “The best guys I have ever met. The purest, the truest. They have been tortured and criminalised unfairly,” says Lancellotti, who helped secure the release of some of the demonstrators from jail in 2013.
Consequently, criticism against him comes from all sides. But of all Lancellotti’s critics, Christians are by far the most ferocious, the priest says. “The atheists are usually more human than those who claim to be Christians. Those who say ‘God above all’ are the same who put humans below everything.” He remains a popular figure for many. His phone rings throughout the day, and he is kept busy with calls – whether it is a media request or speaking to a fellow activist. An avid social media user, the images he posts while helping homeless people can bring happy results. “Families from all over Brazil have been able to find relatives who were believed to have disappeared,” he says.
He has even inspired a federal bill. Approved by the senate on 31 March last year, the “Júlio Lancellotti bill” aims to ban the practice of putting stones and iron spikes in underpasses – a measure adopted by mayors to prevent homeless people sleeping there. Now back in the lower house and waiting to be revised, the bill is a reminder of the day Lancellotti took a sledgehammer to the stones that had been placed in a São Paulo underpass. Lancellotti’s present focus is on lobbying city hall to carry out a more responsible census. According to the priest, the last one in 2019 did not accurately record the number of homeless people in São Paulo – which leads to policies that are incapable of solving the issue. Envisioning a better future for Brazil is still hard for Lancellotti. “Anyone who takes office after this monster [Bolsonaro] won’t be able to restore everything he destroyed in culture, health and education – even in 10 years,” he says, adding: “The Bolsonarismo didn’t appear overnight, and won’t be beaten overnight.” In a country riven by violence and hatred, he concludes, the only way forward is through “dialogue and love”.

385;385;5632;5632;Novak Djokovic secures medical exemption to play in Australian Open;2022-01-04T14:58:24Z;['Tumaini Carayol'];['Novak Djokovic', 'Australian Open 2022', 'Sport', 'Tennis', 'Australian Open', 'Australia sport'];"Novak Djokovic will defend his Australian Open title after revealing he has secured a medical exemption for the tournament and he is on his way to Melbourne. The exemption ends weeks of speculation about the possibility of Djokovic being unable to compete in the opening grand slam tournament of 2022 since he had refused to divulge his vaccination status and had previously expressed doubt about taking a Covid vaccine.
All Australian Open participants must either be fully vaccinated or apply for and secure a medical exemption in order to enter Victoria without undertaking the mandatory 14-day quarantine. “Happy New Year, everybody! Wishing you all health, love, and happiness in every present moment and may you feel love & respect towards all beings on this wonderful planet,” Djokovic wrote on social media. “I’ve spent fantastic quality time with my loved ones over the break and today I’m heading Down Under with an exemption permission. Let’s go 2022 !!”
Djokovic’s announcement has garnered mixed responses from some of his peers. “If it was me that wasn’t vaccinated I wouldn’t be getting an exemption,” said Jamie Murray at the ATP Cup. “But well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete.” Alex de Minaur, Australia’s No 1 men’s player, said that he hopes that other players who applied for exemptions received the same treatment as Djokovic. “I just think it’s just very interesting, that’s all I’m going to say,” De Minaur responded. “But, hey, it is what it is. I just hope that the other players that I heard were cases as well, [I hope] they got exemptions.” Liam Broady, who is Great Britain’s ATP Cup captain in Sydney, said: “You have to trust that he does have a valid reason for the medical exemption.” Shortly after Djokovic’s announcement, the Australian Open confirmed he had received a medical exemption and they released a statement outlining the process. Two panels of experts were charged with reviewing the evidence, with the applications finalised by the Independent Medical Exemption Review Panel, a panel of experts appointed by the government. According to a Victorian state spokesman, the personal information of applicants is redacted in the process.
The Tennis Australia CEO, Craig Tiley, told the Today Show on Wednesday morning that 26 players and staff had applied for a medical exemption but only “a handful” of applications were granted and that participants at the Australian Open had been subject to a more rigorous process than Australian citizens. “If they didn’t meet the guidelines, and there were many that didn’t, they were rejected,” Tiley said. “If they met the guidelines, for example – which a lot of people forget – one of those conditions is having had Covid in the past six months. So any person who met those conditions has been allowed to come in. There’s been no special favour, there’s been no special opportunity granted to Novak nor there would be to any tennis player.”
Criteria listed by the Australian Technical Advisory Group as permissible reasons for a medical exemption range from those suffering acute major medical conditions to any serious adverse event attributed to a previous dose of Covid-19 vaccine. For those who have recently tested positive for Covid-19, vaccination can also be deferred until six months after infection. The reason for Djokovic’s exemption is unclear. While most of the top players have arrived in Melbourne in order to compete in the first week of competition, with some even landing before Christmas, Djokovic remained at his training base in Marbella after withdrawing from this week’s ATP Cup. His presence could prove a defining moment as he attempts to win his 21st major title, which would break the record he shares with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.
Despite successful medical exemptions for Djokovic and some others, not all players were able to make the trip to Melbourne. Natalia Vikhlyantseva, a Russian player ranked 195th, announced her withdrawal from the Australian Open last month since she had been vaccinated with Sputnik V, which was developed in her home country but is not recognised by the Australian government.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/04/novak-djokovic-secures-medical-exemption-to-play-in-australian-open-tennis;4
386;386;5633;5633;Omarion is an R&B singer, not a Covid-19 variant;2022-01-04T14:57:21Z;['Stuart Heritage'];['Music', 'Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus', 'Culture', 'R&B'];"One often overlooked aspect of the current pandemic is the effect that it has had on brands. The poor brands, who long ago settled on a cool-sounding name only to have it coopted by a deadly once-a-century health crisis. Remember Corona, the beer that people used to drink before the association with illness and death became too much to take? Remember Delta, the airline that people used to use before it reminded everyone that new Covid mutations are destined to consign humanity to a quivering wreck for decades to come? These are the real victims. Until now, the Omicron variant has escaped such a fate. This is because Omicron is such a stupid word that the only people who had ever adopted it as a name are an imposing German electrical diagnostic corporation and a Belgian death metal band, and neither one seems particularly bothered by the association. However, if you squint hard enough and pretend that you don’t know how to read, the word “Omicron” sort of looks a bit like ‘Omarion’. And that’s bad news for the R&B singer of the same name who was once part of the band B2K. Because, for almost a full month now, Omarion has found himself on the receiving end of Twitter’s firehose. For a whole swathe of people online, Omicron is now “the Omarion variant”. If you catch it by surprise, you tweet a gif of Omarion on The Masked Singer. If you want to show how the virus spreads, you tweet a video of Omarion dancing through the streets after a woman. If you’re forced into self-isolation, you make a TikTok of Omarion dancing on the end of a lateral flow swab like an especially perky bogey.
Through the thick of the outbreak, Omarion himself has apparently remained oblivious to this association. However, he has finally issued an official response. On New Year’s Day, Omarion uploaded three TikTok videos to help clear up any misunderstanding. “Hi, this is Omarion. I am an artist, not a variant” he explained. “So please be aware that, if you just so happen to run into me on the street, you don’t have to isolate for five days”. “While it’s important not to touch me and keep your distance, cause you know that’s how it’s supposed to be, you don’t need a negative test to dance to my music,” Omarion continued. On another video referencing his old boyband, he added that “The last time I had to do this was in 2000 when everyone confused Y2K with B2K”. Perhaps this is Omarion’s lot. Perhaps every 20 years, some awful catastrophe will befall humanity, and it’ll sound a bit like something vaguely related to something Omarion has done. Maybe in 2040 we’ll be crushed by an asteroid that will come to be colloquially known as Fat Albert, referencing Omarion’s 2004 movie. Or maybe aliens will arrive from the planet Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami, named after the reality show that Omarion appeared on for a single episode in 2019. Perhaps, even, we will be hit by a second pandemic, and science will inexplicably choose to name each new variant after a different disappointing R&B album, and the most deadly wave will carry the title of Omarion’s 2014 record, Sex Playlist. What a way to go. Still, you have to imagine that, deep down, Omarion must be quite pleased that his name is now synonymous with an unimaginably virulent strain of Covid. Because now, when you Google the word Omarion, you get swamped by results about his jokey clarification. And that means that all other news about Omarion has suddenly become much harder to find. That time Reuters ran a news story about Omarion asking his fans to pray for him because he happened to be in London – uninjured and inconvenienced – during the 2005 terrorist attacks? Very difficult to find now. Not impossible, but very hard.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/04/omarion-rb-singer-not-omicron-variant;2
387;387;5634;5634;UK consumers ramp up credit card debt and save less despite Covid crisis;2022-01-04T14:55:40Z;['Phillip Inman'];['Borrowing & debt', 'Money', 'Economics', 'Retail industry', 'Business', 'UK news'];"Consumer borrowing on credit cards jumped to its highest level in more than a year in November, pushing all forms of household unsecured credit to £1.2bn, according to the latest Bank of England data. The increase in reliance on loans and credit cards exceeded City forecasts of a £0.8bn rise and beat the £0.6bn average of the previous six months. Analysts said much of the increase reflected a more confident, pre-pandemic pattern of borrowing, but warned that many low income households had become more dependent on loans to cope with an inflationary squeeze on their finances from rising utility bills and the higher cost of the weekly shop. Households also cut back on the amount of money set aside in deposit accounts to £4.5bn in November, from an average over the previous 12 months of £11.2bn. The dramatic reduction in savings growth was seen as supporting the trend among some consumers to be more confident and spend a higher proportion of their income, while others on lower incomes reduced saving to cover higher bills. Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said that while some households cut back on saving and increased borrowing to cope with a squeeze on their household finances, “it also appears to be indicative of a more bullish consumer mindset”. The threat from the Omicron coronavirus variant would probably reverse the trends for higher borrowing and lower saving in December as households responded to increasing economic uncertainty, said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Saving likely will remain elevated at least until March, when Omicron should be on the retreat,” he said. “Meanwhile, the outlook for inflation to rise to about 6% in the spring suggests that households will save much less this year to sustain their current level of expenditure, given the outlook for falling real disposable income.”
He added that a consumer boom led by a rapid reduction of pandemic-related savings “continues to look very unlikely” while much of the money is needed to offset higher prices. Figures from the Bank of England for mortgage borrowing approvals revealed a fall for the sixth consecutive month in November to a level close to their pre-pandemic, 2015-19 average. The decline to 66,400 approvals a month is expected to become the norm over the rest of this year, said Tombs, despite higher levels of buyer inquiries in November, according to the RICS residential market survey, that pushed house price inflation up by 10%. “Higher mortgage rates look set to subdue the housing market,” he said. “The average quoted rate for a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, with a 75% loan-to-value ratio, jumped to 1.52% in November, from 1.30% in October, and likely will increase to about 1.7% by March, once the full impact of the recent rise in banks’ wholesale funding costs has been seen.”
The Bank of England increased its base rate last month from 0.1% to 0.25% and investors are betting that it rises to at least 0.75% by the end of this year. Threadneedle Street officials appear to have set aside concerns that Britain’s economic recovery from three pandemic-related lockdowns slowed in the second half of last year as the loss of trade from Brexit and global shortages of goods affected consumer spending. Central bank policymakers have stressed that they need to tackle rising prices with higher interest rates to dampen demand.";https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/04/uk-consumers-credit-card-debt-saving-covid-bank-of-england;2
388;388;5635;5635;Israel embarks on fourth Covid vaccination campaign;2022-01-04T14:34:01Z;['Bethan McKernan'];['Israel', 'Coronavirus', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'World news'];Israel has become the first country in the world to embark on a fourth Covid-19 vaccination campaign as part of efforts to stem rapidly rising infection rates caused by the Omicron variant. People over the age of 60 and healthcare workers who received their third shot more than four months ago became eligible for a second booster of Pfizer-BioNTech on Monday, after a limited rollout began last week for elderly people and those with compromised immune systems. Officials had previously said they would wait for more data on the efficacy of a fourth shot before making it more widely available. The Israeli health ministry said on Tuesday, however, that even though it believes the threat posed by Omicron is minimal, it had been forced to act more quickly in the face of skyrocketing infection rates. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said on Tuesday that the preliminary findings of an Israeli study found a fourth dose of vaccine boosted antibodies five-fold after a week. The country recorded its sixth highest daily tally since the pandemic began on Monday with 10,644 cases – a 360% rise on the week before, although the spread of the new variant has not been accompanied by corresponding rises in mortality. “At the moment, I wouldn’t recommend it for younger populations. Our recommendation on a fourth vaccine dose was issued quickly and because there was no choice,” Dr Tal Brosh, the health ministry’s pandemic team coordinator, told Army Radio. “We couldn’t wait to examine this over time in orderly studies. We think that the risk is tiny.” Within a day of making it available, 100,000 people received or made an appointment to get the second booster. The rapid pace of infection has also led to worries over testing kit shortages, with health minister Nitzan Horowitz saying that Israel would adjust its criteria for compulsory testing and focus primarily on people at high risk. As a result, more Israelis “will be required to exercise personal responsibility and perform tests at home”, he said in televised remarks on Monday. In an attempt to avoid a de-facto lockdown and widespread disruption to schools and the economy, precautionary self-isolation periods for people who have been exposed to coronavirus have been scaled down. The rise in domestic transmission also appears to have rendered international travel restrictions moot, with curbs imposed in November set to be lifted. Foreigners from 199 “orange” states will be allowed to enter the country from 9 January provided they are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19. The UK, US, UAE and Turkey remain on Israel’s “red” list. Despite an initial world-leading vaccination programme, vaccine hesitancy within the ultra-Orthodox and Arab communities means that only around 70% of Israel’s 9.3 million residents has received two doses of vaccine to date. Israel was also fiercely criticised by the UN for not doing more to facilitate a faster rollout for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where full vaccination rates are lagging at around 31%.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/israel-embarks-on-fourth-covid-vaccination-campaign;7

What matters is that it is miraculous this match is going ahead. England have almost an entire coaching staff wiped out by Covid. Australia have lost their Brisbane century-maker Travis Head, with three players named as cover. The Cricket Australia chief executive, Nick Hockley, is out and Glenn McGrath will miss at least part of his foundation’s fundraising efforts. In Australian domestic cricket, Big Bash teams are losing quorum to the virus. Yet the show will go on.
Sydney is complicated, a town built on blood and corruption from the first days of its colonial founding. It is beautiful, with a beauty bought by wealth and subsidised by poverty. When you walk its hills at night it can be disarmingly gentle, the humid air curling around you, distant lights on quiet streets, the leaves of the Moreton Bay fig trees or the white-gold petals of frangipani unbearably lush. The harbour unwinds through the city’s core, unspooling in all directions, those waters captured in the words of Kenneth Slessor. To the east is the ocean coast and its storied beaches. To the west it becomes another city, growing ever outwards. In the past year, Sydney has also become the centre of Australia’s viral explosion. By now nobody can remember which wave this is, but a country that successfully held back a global inundation for nearly two years has now given in. Political leaders have sold the idea of a harmless variant and the fantasy that everybody getting sick and getting better will mean an end rather than just another waypoint on a road that has miles to run. For those in countries that have suffered worse and earlier, Australia’s situation may seem tame in comparison. But there has been an abdication of responsibility, leaving people to fend for themselves. It is in Sydney, as cases leap by the day and as leaders find ways to stop counting, that the fourth Ashes Test will be held. It is safe to say that had this series been played at any other time in the pandemic era, in any other country, between any other two teams, it would have been called off by now. England left South Africa in 2020 after one positive test from a worker at the team hotel. Australia gave South Africa an escalating list of demands in 2021 and still refused to tour. India left England early last September when the coach and a physio were infected. The suggestion above is not hypothetical. And yet, this is the Ashes, the main source of revenue for the two boards involved. England’s authorities gain nothing directly from a series played in Australia, but need the reciprocal goodwill to make sure Australia’s touring commitments in the other direction go unaffected. CA’s entire financial existence hinges on the quadrennial infusion from this tour, with broadcast deals in particular based on the popularity of even a one-sided contest. Ultimately it will not matter which players are available or where matches are played, as long as they are on television screens in sufficient quantity to meet the contract.
There will be plenty of ticket revenue too, thanks to a New South Wales government that could most charitably be described as laissez-faire in its public health approach. Under current rules there will be no crowd caps, no requirement to wear masks aside from a few indoor areas, and no check-in required with the government app, which presumably means vaccination certificates will not be checked on entry. A large attendance is expected. So England’s players turn out for the crowd again, despite a week of shambolic preparation and the barrage of distraction from the situation they are in, with a team unchanged bar one bowling selection from the surrender in Melbourne. In fairness, there is little else on the selection front that could be done. The bigger question is how they can possibly find some confidence or motivation to tackle the rest of this series, rather than simply hoping to get it over with. The Australians in contrast should be less affected, coming into the fourth Test with the buoyancy of the first three when almost every move has paid off. Aside from replacing Head for one match, that team will be unchanged from a position of strength rather than weakness, with Scott Boland retained after his dramatic debut with the ball at the MCG.
Ultimately, the Test will be seen as sport fulfilling its purpose as a means of distraction for people who want to stop thinking about problems outside the ground. Sport is always more than that, inextricably part of its wider world, and this match cannot be divorced from its context. It should be seen, too, for illustrating the way cricket’s richest countries treat each other, as opposed to those outside their tiny club. But it is happening. Sydney is, most of all, a town of glitz and cash, where success matters more than how it is achieved. The show will always go on.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/04/ashes-continue-too-much-money-at-stake;4
390;390;5637;5637;Raymonda reborn: Tamara Rojo on ditching the sexism, Arab stereotypes, and 32 one-legged jumps;2022-01-04T14:30:43Z;['Lyndsey Winship'];['Dance', 'Stage', 'Culture', 'Tamara Rojo', 'English National Ballet', 'Ballet'];"When people talk about modernising classic ballets, it usually means taking popular stories and creating new steps for them. But Tamara Rojo is trying the opposite. In her first creation for English National Ballet, Raymonda, she’s keeping the original steps and rewriting the story, turning an 1898 ballet set in the Crusades into a new production inspired by Florence Nightingale and the Crimean war. Rojo’s brainwave solves two problems that pop up when it comes to restaging older works. First, scenarios that have gone stale, sometimes peppered with casual sexism and racism – the original Raymonda is a young woman, engaged to a knight, who is pursued and kidnapped by an offensively cliched Arab baddie. Second, if you always reinvent the steps, you lose the “text” of the ballet itself, the very basis of the art form. As director of ENB since 2012, Rojo has been marching forwards, commissioning new work from contemporary choreographers such as Akram Khan, but she values the past too. “You’ve got an ever-shrinking repertoire of classical works,” says Rojo. “And the fact is that classical works are very important for our art form: the audience love to watch classical ballet and the dancers want to dance them, because it is a proof of their skill. You prove yourself through those very challenging technical roles. We can’t just chuck them away.”
Raymonda was originally created by Marius Petipa, choreographer of Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker, and according to Rojo there is no one to match him. “I have seen how that technique challenges you but also teaches you how to dance, it really does,” she says. “There’s nothing like the coordination that comes from dancing those roles. Even the most contemporary of choreographers want to work with dancers who have that skill.” The particular skills required of a dancer have changed since Petipa’s time. To make Raymonda, Rojo went back to the source, to look at scores held at Harvard University made by Petipa dancer Vladimir Stepanov, who developed his own system of ballet notation. She found the original version of the choreography very different from what you would see now. “The art form has evolved and dancers are unrecognisable in their abilities,” says Rojo. “The men then did almost nothing. The original Jean de Brienne [the heroic male lead] was in his 50s.” Ballerinas today are much “more lyrical, flexible”, she says. They are slender and their muscles longer than those of their predecessors. “We do more variety of movement now, legs all over the place,” says Rojo, “but some things, like hopping on pointe, have been lost. It requires a volume of muscle that ballerinas today don’t have.” The original Raymonda character has to do 32 jumps on pointe on one leg. “Today that is not something we enjoy doing as much,” says Rojo. So has she put those jumps in her new production? “No,” she laughs. “Some things I have adapted.” Rojo has choreographed some new material for the production alongside Petipa’s but sees herself more as a director. “More in line with what Rufus Norris or Nick Hytner or Michael Grandage do with the classical canon,” she says. “Taking it and putting it into a context that the audience might care about.” Erasing the xenophobia was the first priority, but shifting the backdrop from the Crusades to the Crimean war gave Rojo the chance to solve another problem – that of Raymonda herself – a weak character with little motivation behind her steps. “[In the original] she’s everywhere but nowhere,” says Rojo. “So I wanted to give her that agency and voice.” The most famous woman of the Crimean war is, of course, Florence Nightingale, who directly inspired Raymonda’s character. “Raymonda’s struggling to find the freedom to follow her calling,” says Rojo. “If you read Cassandra, the book Florence Nightingale wrote, she despises her mother and sister and the social networks and expectations around her, stuck in a world where she’s expected to marry. In a way, that’s Raymonda.”
In Rojo’s ballet, Raymonda’s fiance, John, is a soldier in Crimea and she follows him there to be a nurse, where she meets John’s friend Abdur, a sophisticated Ottoman envoy, “and suddenly finds herself trapped in a three-way situation between her calling, her duties and something exciting and intriguing and different. And that’s where the ballet finds its tension.” Although it’s set 170 years ago, there’s still much that’s relevant. “The struggle of women, their career versus private life is still very much there, if you ask me,” says Rojo. Telling a story in dance is a tall order. There’s a reason ballet companies so often stick to well-worn tales, because the audience already knows what’s going on. “Narrative in ballet is difficult,” Rojo admits. “There’s no explanation, no pausing and telling you what happened in the other room, there are limitations. But when it works, there’s nothing like it,” she says. “Because it works on an emotional level rather than an intellectual level, when you get it right no other art form can touch ballet. And that’s what we’re always searching for, that miracle moment.” English National Ballet’s Raymonda is at London Coliseum, 13-23 January and at the Mayflower, Southampton, 30 November-3 December.";https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/04/tamara-rojo-interview-raymonda-english-national-ballet;5
391;391;5638;5638;EU’s top diplomat visits Ukraine frontline in show of solidarity;2022-01-04T14:28:20Z;['Jennifer Rankin'];['European Union', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Europe', 'World news'];The European Union’s top diplomat is visiting the frontline of Ukraine’s war with Moscow-backed separatists, amid intensifying diplomatic activity in response to Russia’s buildup of troops on the country’s border. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, began a two-day trip to Ukraine on Tuesday, before US-Russia talks in Geneva on 10 January and Nato-Russia talks on 12 January. Borrell is meeting Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, during a trip intended to show solidarity with Kyiv, which aspires to join Nato and the EU. Tensions rose after Vladimir Putin last month set out security demands that Nato immediately rejected, including a veto on Ukraine entering the military alliance and a ban on troops and weapons along its eastern flank. The EU and US have accused Russia of stoking a crisis by massing tens of thousands of troops along its border with Ukraine. In an attempt to defuse tensions, Russian and US officials are to hold talks on 10 January in Geneva, where the US president, Joe Biden, and Putin met last year. Two days later, western countries will meet Russia in the Nato-Russia Council. Talks will continue on 13 January through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a body that includes the US, its Nato allies, Russia and former Soviet states. The EU is anxious not to be sidelined. “We do not want to be, and must not be, spectators that are not involved and over whose heads decisions are made,” Borrell told Die Welt last week, adding this was also the view of the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, with whom he had spoken before Christmas. Borrell, who has been pushing for more EU military cooperation, said Europe had to be involved in the talks. “European security is our security. It is about us. Two parties, the US and Russia, or Nato and Russia, simply cannot negotiate about this – even if Moscow imagines it that way. We are not in the postwar period. There are some European states that are not Nato allies. There must be no Yalta 2,” he said referring to the second world war meeting of allied powers that accepted Soviet domination of eastern Europe. More than 14,000 people have been killed in Ukraine’s still-smouldering conflict with Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Ukraine’s ambassador to London, Vadym Prystaiko, called on western countries to announce preemptive sanctions against Russia to deter an attack, in contrast to the preference for reactive action. He suggested measures “that can be really painful to Russia” such as switching off its access to the Swift international payments system. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “What Ukrainians are fearing the most” is that a “so-called big deal is baked somewhere behind our backs”. Western leaders, he said, should understand that Ukrainians have their own agenda. “The first item on this agenda is survival in the way we see it, to be close to western democracy.” Tensions have also forced non-Nato member Finland to restate its right to choose its security policy. In a new year message Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, said his country retained the right to join Nato, a point reiterated by the prime minister, Sanna Marin. “Finland retains the option of Nato membership,” she said. “We should uphold this freedom of choice.” Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said last month that if Finland and Sweden joined Nato “this would have serious military and political consequences, which would require an adequate response on Russia’s part”. Nato foreign ministers will hold a special meeting on Friday to discuss Russia’s military buildup and broader security issues, officials announced.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/eu-top-diplomat-ukraine-frontline-show-solidarity-russia;1
392;392;5639;5639;Elizabeth Holmes: from ‘next Steve Jobs’ to convicted fraudster;2022-01-04T14:27:47Z;['Rupert Neate'];['Theranos', 'Business', 'US news', 'Law (US)', 'Technology', 'US economy'];"Just six years ago Forbes magazine declared her the “the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire” and the “next Steve Jobs”. Now, Elizabeth Holmes, 37, founder of the collapsed blood testing company Theranos, is facing decades in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to defraud her investors out of billions. Holmes, a university dropout with no medical training, had fooled regulators and some of the world’s richest people, including Rupert Murdoch, Henry Kissinger and Larry Ellison, into believing she had figured out a way to test for a range of health conditions with just a pinprick of blood. But the tests did not work, and the company was accused of often faking the results. One patient testified that a blood test revealed they were miscarrying when they were pregnant; another said they were given false-positive results for HIV. After a number of regulatory investigations, the company – which at one point was valued at more than $9bn (£6.6bn) – collapsed in 2018. On Monday a California jury convicted Holmes of four counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Holmes had set her sights on becoming an inventor at an early age. She hoped to emulate her great-great-great-grandfather, who co-founded Fleischmann’s Yeast, which revolutionised the breadmaking industry in the late 1800s. At the age of nine, she told her father that what she “really want[s] out of life is to discover something new, something that mankind didn’t know was possible to do”. While a 19-year-old student at Stanford University, she thought she had found it. Working out of the basement of her shared college house, she founded Theranos in 2003. Brimming with self-confidence, she convinced her parents to let her drop out of university and cash in an education trust they had set up for her. She used it to rent a lab and hire her first employee. Holmes’s desire to improve medical testing was driven by a familial aversion to needles, that could cause her mother and her grandmother to faint at the sight of blood. “I really believe that if we were from a foreign planet and we were sitting here and said, ‘OK, let’s brainstorm on torture experiments’, the concept of sticking a needle into someone and sucking blood out slowly, while the person watches, probably qualifies,” she told the New Yorker in 2014 for a profile that said she had the potential to “upend the lucrative business of blood testing”. Holmes, who helped engineer the comparisons to her idol, Jobs, by dressing in black turtlenecks, quickly became a star on the public speaking circuit. Addressing a TedMed conference in 2014, she said getting a blood test should be easier, quicker and cheaper. It should be, she said, “a wonderful” experience. “We see a world in which no one ever has to say, ‘If only I’d known sooner’. A world in which no one ever has to say goodbye too soon,” she told the Washington DC audience. “The right to protect the health and wellbeing of every person, of those we love, is a basic human right. Yet in the United States today, healthcare is the leading cause of bankruptcy and the lack of it the leading cause of … finding out too late in the disease progression process that someone you love is really, really sick.” The top comment under the video on YouTube says: “She did a better job playing Steve Jobs than Ashton Kutcher” (Kutcher played Jobs in the 2013 biopic Jobs.) “Here was a photogenic, telegenic young woman posing as the female Steve Jobs,” recalled Margaret O’Mara, a historian of Silicon Valley who holds a professorship at the University of Washington. “It was an incredibly alluring narrative that everyone wanted to believe.” Not quite everyone. Holmes’s tall tales started to unravel in 2015 – soon after Theranos hit its record $9bn valuation – when the Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou began an investigation into the validity of the company’s tests. When Carreyrou went to Holmes for comment for his story, she asked the Journal’s owner, Rupert Murdoch – a Theranos investor – to prevent its publication. “You personally went to the owner of The Wall Street Journal to try to quash the story,” Robert Leach, an assistant US attorney, asked her during the trial. “I did,” she replied. Carreyrou’s story was printed. Dozens more followed, leading to the collapse of the company and taking with it Murdoch’s $125m investment.";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/04/elizabeth-holmes-from-next-steve-jobs-to-convicted-fraudster;2
393;393;5640;5640;‘Perfect spot’: statue of fossil hunter Mary Anning nears unveiling;2022-01-04T14:18:58Z;['Caroline Davies'];['Palaeontology', 'UK news', 'Fossils', 'Sculpture', 'Women', 'Heritage', 'Culture', 'Science', 'Dorset'];"A statue to the 19th-century fossil hunter and palaeontologist Mary Anning, who was once “lost to history”, is finally set to be unveiled in 2022 in her home town of Lyme Regis after a schoolgirl’s four-year campaign. Campaigners, who have overcome bureaucratic red tape and raised more than £100,000 in crowdfunding, have been granted planning permission to site the bronze in “the perfect spot”, overlooking Black Ven cliffs on the Jurassic coast in Dorset, where she made her pioneering finds. Evie Swire, 13, was nine when she first heard of Anning, born in 1799, who sold fossils to supplement her family’s meagre income and who is the subject of the film Ammonite, starring Kate Winslet. Disappointed there was no local tribute to Anning, who in life was largely ignored by the scientific establishment yet is now regarded as a significant female force in science, she began the Mary Anning Rocks campaign. But first the coronavirus pandemic, then disputes over where the statue should be sited, looked likely to thwart plans to unveil the work, by the sculptor Denise Dutton, on the 223rd anniversary of Anning’s birth in May 2022.
Anya Pearson, Evie’s mother, said plans to place the statue near the giant anchor viewpoint on Lyme Regis seafront were resisted, and the project was then added to a long list of applications amid the pandemic. Another proposal, to place the statue on a cart road below the Marine theatre, was also rejected. “But now we finally have the perfect spot for her, facing Black Ven [cliff] and Golden Cap [hill]. Black Ven is where she found most of her fossils, and it is just the most evocative spot, looking out to sea,” said Pearson. ‘It is the same background view as that in the only portrait ever painted of Mary. So there is great connectivity. “It’s been a long battle, and at one point I really thought the whole project might be strangled by bureaucratic red tape. I thought the hard-part would be the fundraising, not getting planning permission. “But the local people really got behind it, and have been amazing,” she added. The clay model of Anning and her dog, Tray, which is one-and-a-quarter lifesize, is due to be cast in bronze in early 2022, with the unveiling scheduled for May. As part of the campaign, whose patrons include Sir David Attenborough, and the academic and broadcaster Prof Alice Roberts, the Mary Anning Rocks learning legacy will enable children from underprivileged backgrounds across the UK to visit the statue and go fossil hunting on the beaches, “discovering the next generation of Mary Annings”, added Pearson. Anning was responsible for many pioneering finds, including one of the first ichthyosaurus skeletons, and became immensely knowledgable in the then emerging field of palaeontology. But her finds were often credited to the male collectors to whom she sold her fossils. Her disappointment and frustration was evident in one surviving letter, in which she wrote: “The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone.” She died aged 47. The planning application papers said that, despite coming from a poor background, Anning’s finds changed the way scientists thought about the origins of our planet and how life evolved on it. It read: “Throughout Mary Anning’s lifetime, her achievements have largely gone unacknowledged with her name having been eradicated from the historic archives due to her being an uneducated, working-class woman and an outsider to the polite and scientific community.” Anning had not previously been championed in the town, “because she was just not known about”, said Pearson. “If she had been male and upper class, a statue would have been raised over a hundred years ago.” “I really feel we have finally righted a historic wrong.”";https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/04/perfect-spot-statue-of-fossil-hunter-mary-anning-nears-unveiling;3

The rare copy of Incredible Hulk #1, which was published in 1962, was bought by a private collector for $490,000 (£360,000). Comic Connect, an auction site which handled the sale, said it was the most expensive copy of the first Hulk story ever sold.
Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the comic reveals the Hulk’s origin story, in which the scientist Dr Bruce Banner is exposed to toxic gamma rays, and thenceforth transforms into the Hulk when he loses his temper. In his first outing, the Hulk is shown with grey skin, but Marvel changed the colouring to his now-signature green for the second issue, because the four-colour printing process at the time meant the grey came out differently on different pages. The issue is graded “very fine/near mint” on the comics grading scale. “Highly graded copies of Hulk No 1 are notoriously hard to find, due to the cheap paper used and the smudging of the grey colour on the front cover,” said Vincent Zurzolo from the comics site. Zurzolo predicted that the issue would “continue to gain in value”. “Vintage comic book values just keep going up,” he added. The Hulk has a long way to go, however, before he smashes the record set by his Marvel stablemate, Spider-Man. In September, a copy of the 1962 comic Amazing Fantasy #15, in which Spider-Man makes his debut, sold for $3.6m (£2.5m).";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/04/rare-first-edition-of-the-incredible-hulk-comic-sells-for-490000;5
395;395;5642;5642;Hiding behind the loophole of a dead sex trafficker? Stay classy, Andrew | Marina Hyde;2022-01-04T14:06:33Z;['Marina Hyde'];['Prince Andrew', 'UK news', 'Jeffrey Epstein', 'US news', 'Ghislaine Maxwell', 'Queen Elizabeth II', 'Monarchy'];"Where does Prince Andrew drive to in his brand new, £80,000 Range Rover – seemingly his only appearances these days in anything that could be considered the outside world? The duke is often pictured motoring broodingly out of his Royal Lodge home in Windsor at the wheel of this high-performance vehicle, perhaps making his in-car security detail listen to a podcast about putting, or a funny song about a whoopee cushion. (The precise contours of Andrew’s cultural life have always remained a tantalising mystery.) Some local visits to his mother at Windsor Castle have been chalked up, as well they might be. But we’ll come to the duke’s ominous financial reliance on the Queen in a minute. Were The Artist Formerly Known as Airmiles to take an aimless intra-Berkshire spin this morning, he would be able to listen to news reports concerning the newly unsealed settlement his accuser reached with Jeffrey Epstein in 2009. Virginia Giuffre signed a $500,000 deal with Epstein, and Andrew’s lawyers believe her agreement not to sue anyone who could be described as a “potential defendant” could get HRH off the hook of having to face, in civil court, her claims that he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was a minor. (He denies everything, vehemently.) If this does succeed in persuading a judge to dismiss Giuffre’s current suit, then once again someone else’s money will have insulated Andrew from alleged self-created realities. It always seems to be someone else’s money, of course. In this case, it would be the $500,000 of a dead sex trafficker. However, other funds are available. Andrew’s mother is widely reported to be paying his legal bills for this increasingly grotesque saga, which will be running well into seven figures by now. What follows can only be speculation, with the duke’s case not due to be heard till later in the year. But having his legal fees quietly covered by the Queen would feel like the very upper limit of what a lot of people in this country would accept. There are, of course, many committed anti-royalists in the UK, but the British public don’t in the majority regard the 95-year-old sovereign as the sort of freeloader at whom they might scream: “We pay your wages!” The Queen’s various vast incomes have not been a hot topic of debate in recent years in whatever counts as middle England. But in the event that Giuffre’s case against Andrew proceeds and he loses it, and a multimillion-dollar payment has to be made, you get the feeling public attitudes would change overnight if the maternal bailout ran to forking out Andy’s damages for him. You can imagine people who are quite happy for the Queen to spend money restoring obscure Scottish castles and whatnot suddenly feeling less relaxed about it being spaffed on paying blood money for a sex offender. Whatever the accounting, I’m not sure any distinction between public funds and private income would be made by the average person. Anyway, that’s enough banging on about Andy’s mama. Not that I haven’t very much enjoyed the recent articles by gentlemen of a certain age who have FINALLY found a woman they care about in the long-running Epstein story. Unsurprisingly, perhaps – it’s the Queen! Here at last is a lady tangentially connected to the grimness whose honour and dignity actually matters, as opposed to those of the other ladies involved, whose tribulations they have at no point been interested in writing about. Even Ghislaine Maxwell has elicited more sympathy in some quarters than the actual victims of Epstein. And, indeed, the victims of Maxwell herself. Madam has now been found guilty of recruiting, grooming and trafficking teenage girls for sex with Epstein, not that you’d know it from the airtime still bafflingly given on both sides of the Atlantic to those such as her brother Kevin Maxwell. Ah, the classic “sex offender’s brother” interview slot. You probably remember it from other trials such as … no, sorry, I can’t put my finger on any. Drawing a big old blank here. In any case, what does Kevin Maxwell know about anything? Four hundred million pounds was stolen from the pension funds of a business empire in which he was the second-most powerful person, and a fraud trial acquitted him of having a clue about it. So I think broadcasters can spare audiences his “insights” on anything else, ever again. Infinitely more worth listening to are the victims themselves, who may be permitted to make victim impact statements at Maxwell’s forthcoming sentencing. Giuffre could be among them. The other thing worth listening to, alas, is the ongoing sound of silence where the mention of other men’s names should be. Despite the saga rumbling on for years, we still have little idea who all the other men involved in this seedy web were, and absolutely no indication that anyone in law enforcement cares enough to find out now that they have got their woman. I can’t help feeling those hoping Ghislaine will name names for clemency are being pretty optimistic. Given that Ghislaine believes Epstein was murdered in jail, as opposed to killing himself, it seems unlikely she would expose herself to what she would presumably regard as a likely similar fate, should she begin singing like a canary.
Seemingly all of Epstein’s friends were power players, chosen for their use to him, and they must all have known rather a lot about his proclivities. Way back in 2002, Donald Trump was joking pointedly to New York magazine that Epstein liked them “on the younger side”. Beyond that, plenty of ageing Epstein buddies were involved in his web of abuse, accepting hospitality on “Paedo Island”, ferried in aboard his “Lolita Express” private plane. But they’ve all retreated into their money, their omertàs, and the timeworn knowledge that reckonings are for women and other little people. Epstein knew the code better than anyone, which is presumably why he took care in his 2009 settlement with Giuffre to exempt others from being named as “potential defendants” in the future. What a thoughtful legacy to his bros. And how remarkable that Prince Andrew should regard seizing it as his best defensive shot. Swerving court via a loophole provided by one of the leading international paedos of the age … Well, if that isn’t staying classy, then I really don’t know what is.

In this case the crims are led by newly released convict Johnny (Mickey Rourke, looking more melted than usual) and the family is a nuclear set-up led by James Baker (Michael Jai White), a DEA agent with PTSD. Johnny and co are supposedly trying is to recover money from a bank robbery, hidden years ago. But in this generally reprehensible subgenre, it doesn’t matter why the baddies break in. What matters is that it entitles at least one member of the terrorised family to fight back using their unique skills and, inevitably, armed force. Conspiracy-minded viewers might wonder if some of these films aren’t subsidised by pro-gun lobbyists as a way to drum fear into the audience and maintain support for the right to keep huge home arsenals to ward against a danger with a vanishingly small probability in the real world.
Produced, co-written and directed by Asif Akbar, The Commando contains a number of egregious implausibilities and cliches. For starters, Johnny’s henchmen are so stupid and bloodthirsty they can’t even wait for the occupants to leave the house before they invade. They just barge in while one of Baker’s daughters is having a small party. Several teens are shot, one while he’s having a wee and ends up spraying urine all over the most violent of the bad guys, Dominic (Gianni Capaldi, distantly related to Peter); this appears to be meant as a comic highlight.
Finally, Baker and his wife come home and it ends, inevitably, with a series of fisticuffs, gunfights and brawls before good supposedly triumphs over evil, although one of the kids has been raped. Perhaps we are meant to infer she deserved it for throwing a party while her folks were away; that tells you everything about the intended audience for this pernicious nonsense. • The Commando is released on 10 January on digital platforms.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/04/the-commando-review-mickey-rourke;5

Signe, Brighton “It’s all about a drizzle, a dollop and a crunch,” says Bettina Campolucci-Bordi, author of Celebrate: Plant-Based Recipes for Every Occasion. “I add at least two to every meal, and that instantly creates different textures.” A drizzle could be something as simple as good-quality olive or flavoured oil (chilli, garlic, basil) or date syrup, while a dollop is essentially something creamy: “Hummus made from butter beans or chickpeas, a pesto or flavoured yoghurt, say.” As for the crunch, that’s “chopped toasted nuts, a chunky dukkah or za’atar, pomegranate, sunflower or pumpkin seeds, roast chickpeas flavoured with things like tandoori spice”. In short, Signe would be wise to adopt Campolucci-Bordi’s mantra of “more is better”. Another tactic for avoiding the mush factor is to consider how you chop your veg. “With vegetables that need more cooking, such as potatoes, chop them small, whereas if you’re adding courgettes to the same dish, chop them bigger, otherwise they’ll go soft and mushy.” For extra oomph on the texture front, Craig and Shaun McAnuff, whose latest book, Natural Flava: Quick and Easy Plant-Based Caribbean Recipes, is out this month, favour roasting their veg (“for an incredible crust on the outside and melty insides”) or grilling it (“it gives you that crispy texture and smoky flavour”). Vivek Singh’s texture tricks, meanwhile, include frying mustard seeds and urid lentils with curry leaves and spices in oil, then tipping the lot into a lentil broth. Another option, says the executive chef and founder of The Cinnamon Collection restaurant group, is to top lentil and bean dishes with raw, pickled or lightly sauteed vegetables (think chopped broccoli or cauliflower). “You can also experiment by adding chopped nuts, fried shallots, and puffed or toasted flaked rice to the top of big, hearty bowls of lentils and rice for extra substance.” Some spicy scrambled tofu wouldn’t go amiss, either. Singh also recommends khichdi to keep Signe’s family’s objections at bay. “It’s a traditional, home-style rice and lentil dish tempered with cumin, turmeric and vegetables [cauliflower, peas, carrots, chopped tomatoes].” He ups the ante by serving it with a roast aubergine relish: “Stuff two aubergine halves with cloves of garlic and rub with mustard oil. Char the aubergine over an open flame, turning frequently, until blackened evenly on all sides.” Once cool, remove and discard the skin and the garlic, chop the flesh and mix with sea salt, red onion, chillies, coriander and mustard oil. Finally, when all routes point to pasta, Shaun McAnuff is partial to a “creamy, crunchy” vegan mac and cheese. He caramelises onion, garlic and chilli, mixes that with cooked pasta and vegan “cheese” sauce, and seasons. “Spoon into a deep baking dish, top with vegan mozzarella and breadcrumbs [you could even use broken crackers], and bake.” His brother, Craig, meanwhile, is all about pesto made with callaloo, a leafy Caribbean green. “All you do is caramelise garlic and mustard seed, then blitz with callaloo [or spinach], nuts, avocado, scotch bonnet and spices.” Toss that through cooked pasta and top with a sprinkling of nuts (walnuts, almonds, cashews) for that all-important crunch. • Got a culinary dilemma?

398;398;5645;5645;Women 32% more likely to die after operation by male surgeon, study reveals;2022-01-04T14:00:14Z;['Denis Campbell'];['Doctors', 'Health', 'Society', 'Hospitals', 'Women', 'UK news', 'Canada', 'Medical research', 'Gender'];"Women who are operated on by a male surgeon are much more likely to die, experience complications and be readmitted to hospital than when a woman performs the procedure, research reveals. Women are 15% more liable to suffer a bad outcome, and 32% more likely to die, when a man rather than a woman carries out the surgery, according to a study of 1.3 million patients. The findings have sparked a debate about the fact that surgery in the UK remains a hugely male-dominated area of medicine and claims that “implicit sex biases” among male surgeons may help explain why women are at such greater risk when they have an operation. “In our 1.3 million patient sample involving nearly 3,000 surgeons we found that female patients treated by male surgeons had 15% greater odds of worse outcomes than female patients treated by female surgeons,” said Dr Angela Jerath, an associate professor and clinical epidemiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada and a co-author of the findings. “This result has real-world medical consequences for female patients and manifests itself in more complications, readmissions to hospital and death for females compared with males. “We have demonstrated in our paper that we are failing some female patients and that some are unnecessarily falling through the cracks with adverse, and sometimes fatal, consequences.” The findings have been published in the medical journal JAMA Surgery. Jerath added: “These results are concerning because there should be no sex difference in patient outcomes regardless of the surgeon’s sex. “On a macro level the results are troubling. When a female surgeon operates, patient outcomes are generally better, particularly for women, even after adjusting for differences in chronic health status, age and other factors, when undergoing the same procedures. Jerath and her colleagues analysed the records of 1,320,108 patients in Ontario who underwent 21 common surgical procedures performed by 2,937 surgeons between 2007 and 2019. They ranged from hip and knee replacements and weight loss surgery to removal of an appendix or gall bladder and more complicated operations such as a heart bypass, aneurysm repair and brain surgery. For each of the 1.3m operations they analysed, the sex of each patient and details of how their procedure had gone and also the sex of the surgeon who carried it out. They found that men who had an operation had similar outcomes regardless of whether their surgeon was male or female (an exception being significantly decreased mortality for men, 13%, when the surgeon was female). However, women experienced better outcomes if the procedure had been performed by a female surgeon compared with a male surgeon. There were no gender differences in how surgery went for either men or women operated on by a female surgeon. Jerath added that while “there are some excellent male surgeons who consistently have good outcomes, what is concerning is that this analysis does signal some real difference among male and female surgeons overall where practice can impact general patient outcomes”. The researchers said the study was the first of its kind to examine the association between the sex of the patient, the sex of their surgeon and the outcomes of surgery. They looked at three types of “adverse postoperative outcome”: death, readmission to hospital and complications within 30 days. They found that for women, treatment by a male surgeon was associated with a 15% increased likelihood of a poor outcome than if they were treated by a female surgeon. However, men experienced similar results in most post-operative outcome categories whether they were treated by a male or female surgeon. Similarly, women who were operated on by a male surgeon had a 32% higher risk of death than those whose surgery had been performed by a woman. For example, while 1.4% of women who had a cardiothoracic operation with a male surgeon died, fewer – 1% – did so when a female surgeon was involved. In both brain surgery and vascular surgery, while 1.2% of women who underwent either type of operation with a male surgeon died, again that proportion was much lower among those whose surgeon was female – 0.9% – giving a 33% higher risk of death. Overall, female patients also had a 16% greater risk of complications and an 11% greater risk of readmission and were 20% more likely to have to stay in hospital longer when treated by male surgeons, compared to female surgeons. Women had a higher risk of death, readmission or complications when a man performed the operation across many of the 21 types of surgery analysed. For example, while 20.2% of women who had cardiothoracic (chest) surgery by a male surgeon suffered some form of adverse reaction, a lower percentage – 18% – did so if their surgeon was female. The same pattern was seen in general surgery, brain surgery and orthopaedic surgery. Technical differences between male and female surgeons are unlikely to explain the findings “as both sexes undergo the same technical medical training”, said Jerath.
“Implicit sex biases”, in which surgeons “act on subconscious, deeply ingrained biases, stereotypes and attitudes”, may be one possible explanation, she said. Differences in men’s and women’s communication and interpersonal skills evident in surgeons’ discussions with patients before the operation takes place may also be a factor, she added. And “differences between male and female physician work style, decision-making and judgment”. Fiona Myint, the vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, highlighted that 86% of consultant (senior) surgeons in Britain were men. “Surgery is still a long way from having a gender balance in its workforce. Women make up 41% of early stage surgeons but only 30% of higher trainees and 14% of consultants,” she said. Parenthood, “a lack of flexibility in [surgical] training schedules and rotas” and “negative attitudes to less than full-time training” all explain why many women do not become consultant surgeons, she added. Scarlett McNally, who has been a consultant orthopaedic surgeon for 20 years, said there was “increasing evidence of a different experience for women surgeons, with many being put off surgery and reporting historical ‘microaggressions’”. In addition, female patients may feel more at ease talking to a female surgeon before the operation, including steps they should take to improve their chances of a good outcome, such as stopping smoking to help ensure a bone graft takes, she added. McNally also cited “unconscious bias” – assumptions among senior surgeons, nurses, administrators and patients that female medical students or young doctors will not want to pursue a career in surgery – as a factor. “Having more female surgeons would improve all patients’ outcomes,” she said. The Royal College of Surgeons of England said the findings were “interesting. Much more detailed research is required looking at communication, trust and doctor-patient relationships.” • This article was amended on 26 May 2022 to state that the study found most post-operative outcomes for men were similar to those of women, rather than “the same”, whether their surgeon was male or female; in the mortality category there was a decrease of 13% for men with a female surgeon.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/04/women-more-likely-die-operation-male-surgeon-study;7

400;400;5647;5647;UK government urged to rescind Tony Blair’s knighthood;2022-01-04T13:45:22Z;['Jessica Elgot'];['Tony Blair', 'New Year honours list', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Keir Starmer', 'Labour'];More than half a million people have called on the government to rescind the knighthood given to Sir Tony Blair, but Keir Starmer has defended the former prime minister, saying the honour was deserved. The Labour leader said Blair was a worthy recipient of the Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, received in the new year honour’s list. “I don’t think it’s thorny at all. I think he deserves the honour. Obviously I respect the fact that people have different views,” Starmer told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. “I understand there are strong views on the Iraq war. There were back at the time and there still are, but that does not detract from the fact that Tony Blair was a very successful prime minister of this country and made a huge difference to the lives of millions of people in this country.” Blair, who led Labour to three election victories, was prime minister during the allied military invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. The petition on Change.org was created by Angus Scott, who wrote: “Tony Blair caused irreparable damage to both the constitution of the United Kingdom and to the very fabric of the nation’s society. He was personally responsible for causing the death of countless innocent, civilian lives and servicemen in various conflicts. For this alone he should be held accountable for war crimes.” The viral petition was not created on the parliamentary website, where petitions have legal standing. Petitions that are signed there by 10,000 people must receive a response from the government, and those signed by more than 100,000 people are considered for debate in parliament. Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said it had not been the prime minister’s choice to award Blair the honour. “Appointments to the Order of the Garter are a matter for Her Majesty the Queen, there is no involvement of the prime minister or government, so it wouldn’t be one for me to comment on,” he said. “I would point out every former prime minister before Tony Blair has received the Order of the Garter or Thistle.” The appointment, which is made by the Queen, was last bestowed on Sir John Major – Blair’s predecessor. Appointments to the Garter are in the Queen’s gift and made without prime ministerial advice. The Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has also defended the honour’s award. “Whatever people might think, it is one of the toughest jobs in the world,” he said, “and I think it is respectful and it is the right thing to do … They should all be offered that knighthood when they finish as prime minister.” Asked whether Johnson should receive the same honour, Starmer said it had not been earned. “I don’t think that this prime minister has earned the right to have an honour. I do think Tony Blair has,” he said.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/04/uk-government-urged-to-rescind-tony-blair-knighthood;1
401;401;5648;5648;Two more NHS trusts declare critical incidents over staff Covid absences;2022-01-04T13:39:16Z;['Maya Wolfe-Robinson'];['NHS', 'Hospitals', 'Lancashire', 'Coronavirus', 'Health', 'Society', 'UK news'];"Two NHS trusts in Lancashire have declared critical incidents in their hospitals owing to staff absences, as the region’s health chief said officials were “bracing ourselves for a tsunami of Omicron cases”. Morecambe Bay NHS trust, which operates three hospitals across north Lancashire and southern Cumbria, made its move on Monday evening, and the trust that runs Blackpool Victoria hospital followed suit on Tuesday morning, saying its beds were at full capacity. They join at least six other trusts that are understood to have issued alerts over “internal critical incidents” in recent days, including United Lincolnshire hospitals NHS trust. In an internal memo, Morecambe Bay’s chief executive, Aaron Cummins, said “relentless and sustained pressure” caused by “unprecedented staff absences” would lead to operations and appointments being cancelled and staff being redeployed to allow the hospitals to maintain safe services for patients. The trust operates three sites: Furness general hospital in Barrow-in-Furness, the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, and Westmorland general hospital in Kendal. Barrow-in-Furness has the highest Covid infection rate of any local authority area in England, at 2,439.8 cases per 100,000 population. Both Lancashire trusts said staff absences were running at 10% or above, and high numbers of medically fit patients were unable to be discharged owing to the levels of coronavirus in the community. In a memo to colleagues, the Blackpool trust’s chief executive, Trish Armstrong-Child, wrote that “this has resulted in more people being admitted to hospital each day than we are discharging, which simply cannot be sustained as Covid infections continue to surge.”
Blackpool teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust, which runs the Victoria hospital, Clifton hospital and Fleetwood hospital, said it was experiencing “high demand and long waits” for A&E and other urgent care. In a statement, it said the declaration of a critical incident was “an attempt to alleviate the pressure we are under, including stepping down some non-urgent activity in order to deliver all of the things we can and need to do to provide the very best care possible.” Cummins wrote that one issue at his trust was that “seriously sick patients are waiting too long to be admitted and there are many times when we are operating on a one in, one out basis”. Sakthi Karunanithi, the director of public health for Lancashire, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the region was experiencing what London had been through at the beginning of the month. “We are bracing ourselves for a tsunami of Omicron cases in Lancashire,” he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/04/two-more-nhs-trusts-declare-critical-incidents-over-staff-covid-absences;7
402;402;5649;5649;Taiwan ‘buys 20,400 bottles of Lithuanian rum rejected by China’;2022-01-04T13:38:49Z;['Helen Davidson'];['Taiwan', 'China', 'Lithuania', 'International trade', 'Business'];"Taiwan’s government is sharing cocktail recipes with the public after it reportedly bought 20,400 bottles of Lithuanian rum bound for China amid a row between Vilnius and Beijing. The state-owned Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor (TTL) said it made the purchase in December to support Lithuania after learning the shipment was going to be blocked by Chinese authorities. “TTL stood up at the right time, purchased the rum and brought it to Taiwan,” the company said in a statement reported by the South China Morning Post. “Lithuania supports us and we support Lithuania – TTL calls for a toast to that.” Lithuania is in an ongoing diplomatic dispute with Beijing, and has been hit with trade and other restrictions since it announced it would establish mutual diplomatic posts with Taiwan. The South China Morning Post said Taiwan’s finance ministry, which wholly owns TTL, and the de facto ambassador to Lithuania, Eric Huang, had learned China was going to reject the shipment, and informed TTL.
TTL and the producer of the dark rum, MV Group Productions, have not responded to the claims. However, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, Taiwan’s national development council, the parliament’s policy planning agency, posted a list of rum-based cocktails and other recipes and urged people to be ready to buy the product in late January. The post called on people to “support Lithuania”, saying the two countries were very friendly and had helped each other during the pandemic. The Chinese government has for months been applying pressure and blocking trade with Lithuania, outraged over Vilnius allowing the word “Taiwan” to be used in the name of Taipei’s de facto embassy. Taiwan usually uses the word “Taipei” in naming its diplomatic offices. Beijing claims Taiwan as a province and is hypersensitive to any action which appears to support Taiwan’s stance of being a sovereign nation. In recent years Beijing has frequently blocked or restricted imports from countries it is engaged in diplomatic disputes with, including coal, wine, and lobsters from Australia, and pineapples from Taiwan. Taiwan’s government is working to strengthen relationships with friendly nations as it seeks to resist Chinese aggression, and has in the past enthusiastically supported those hit with trade restrictions, urging Taiwanese people to buy up the product.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/taiwan-buys-20400-bottles-of-lithuanian-rum-rejected-by-china;2
403;403;5650;5650;Boris Johnson would not deserve an honour, says Keir Starmer;2022-01-04T13:35:51Z;['Aubrey Allegretti'];['Labour', 'Keir Starmer', 'Boris Johnson', 'Tony Blair', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"Boris Johnson should not be given an honour by the Queen, Keir Starmer has said, as he accused the prime minister of treating voters like fools and promised a new “contract with the British people” to uphold trust in a future Labour government. In a speech designed to kick off a new phase in Labour’s preparation for the next general election, Starmer said reports of Downing Street parties in defiance of Covid rules had not just exposed problems with Johnson’s own behaviour, but “the flaws of a whole style of government”. Starmer said Labour had given ministers “the benefit of the doubt” on Covid restrictions to support the country through a national crisis but warned that the government had lost “the moral right to set those rules” because of the alleged rule-breaking. He signalled an intent to move beyond just criticising the government and to present optimistic alternative policies, vowing: “I came into politics to make things happen, not just to talk about them. I don’t think politics is a branch of the entertainment industry. I think it’s the serious business of getting things done.”
During a speech in Birmingham, the Labour leader said his new contract would give people the assurance that Labour was ready for power by focusing on security, prosperity and respect. Name-checking the three Labour leaders who have won elections – Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Tony Blair – Starmer said he would lead a “patriotic” party. “It’s normally the job of the opposition to criticise and oppose, but it can make us sound pretty miserable,” he conceded. “It can sound as if we don’t realise our own historical good fortune to have been born into a peaceful, creative, liberal democracy.” Starmer said the Conservatives’ recent plummet in the polls did not automatically mean voters would switch to Labour, and promised he had a strategy to show people over the next 12 months why his party was “worthy” of their support. “Trust has to be earned,” he added. “I am confident but not complacent about the task ahead.” Starmer said the number of Covid cases, which is almost double what it was during the third lockdown last year, was “cause for concern” but was hopeful that no extra restrictions would be needed. He criticised ministers over the rollout of jabs to children over the age of 12, and said better ventilation and mass testing was needed in schools to avoid them having to close again. The possibility of a more-transmissible variant or one resistant to vaccines was a “known threat”, Starmer said, adding that he would support cutting isolation from seven to five days if the government’s scientific advisers recommended it. He also said ministers should study “all available evidence” about whether a fourth vaccine may be needed to top up protection from Covid further, after Andrew Pollard, the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said it was “not sustainable” to keep topping up people’s immunity while millions around the world were still unvaccinated. Starmer also defended the awarding of a knighthood to Blair in the new year honours list, after a petition against the move surpassed 500,000 signatures. Asked if Johnson was worthy of an honour, he told the audience in Birmingham: “No. I’m sorry, I do not think the prime minister has earned the right to have an honour. I do think Tony Blair has.” Pressed by the Guardian on what policies Labour would use to woo back voters who had deserted the party since 2010, Starmer pointed to announcements made since he became leader nearly two years ago. He said the party’s stances on housing, employment rights and tackling climate change were “very strong, very Labour” and vowed that his contract would “build on that and take those ideas to the country”. Senior Labour figures are preparing for the possibility of a general election next spring. They said Starmer had reformed the party’s internal procedures, presented a strong case against the Conservative government and would during the course of 2022 move to outlining more positive policies to put it on an election-ready footing.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/04/boris-johnson-would-not-deserve-an-honour-says-keir-starmer;1
404;404;5651;5651;Lake District mountain rescue warning after ‘chaotic’ festive period;2022-01-04T13:31:08Z;['Josh Halliday'];['Lake District', 'UK news'];"Mountain rescue teams have urged day trippers to properly plan their walks after an “absolutely chaotic” Christmas period and warnings of blizzards on the way. A rescue group in the Lake District said there were 11 callouts during Christmas week, including one that involved 75 people looking for a man and his 11-year-old son on Scafell Pike. Richard Warren, the chair of the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association, said his teams were called out a record 680 times in 2021 and the start of 2022 had been “just as busy”. Volunteers are braced for a potentially busy few weeks as people take to the outdoors as part of a new year health kick. A cold blast of weather could put the skids on those new year resolutions, however. The Met Office has put a yellow weather warning in place for the Lake District this Friday, with blizzard conditions and snow showers forecast. Snow is expected to fall across other high parts of the UK towards the end of the week, and there will be cold temperatures and blustery showers. In the Peak District, heavy snow showers are expected on Friday, followed by gale-force winds at the weekend.
Warren said there had been two callouts on Christmas Day in the Lake District, and there had been a “very sad end to the year” when a man died after a medical episode on Skiddaw on New Year’s Eve. Volunteers have urged people to check weather forecasts and whether they have the right gear before they take to the mountains. “A lot of rescues are avoidable because people get lost with no map, compass or torch,” Warren said. “Really we want people to start thinking about what they are doing, when they are doing it and to check the weather.” Colin Price, a duty team leader for Edale mountain rescue team in the Peak District, said the start of 2022 had already been “super busy” and he expected huge numbers of visitors to return during the year. The pandemic led to a record 155 callouts in 2020, he said, with last year the second busiest on record. “We’re getting larger numbers within the national park and you can see it on a normal weekend – it’s more like a bank holiday weekend,” he said. Price said he welcomed the “broader mix” of people visiting the Peak District but some day trippers lacked the experience or equipment needed when walking on sometimes treacherous terrain. “The Peak District is there for everybody but maybe we’re getting people that are not quite as familiar with it, or so experienced, and it’s catching a few people out,” he said. He advised packing head torches, extra food and warm clothing for winter walks, and a compass and map for longer walks. In Snowdonia national park, volunteers were called out a record 237 times last year, of which 147 were in the warmer months between June and September. Barry Davies, the chair of Llanberis mountain rescue team, said it was vital for people to respect the environment and take care even when walking well-trodden paths. “We had four fatalities last year on Snowdon, so the mountain can be a risky environment,” he said. “The incidents vary from lost and lonely to people who become seriously injured just from a simple fall.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/lake-district-mountain-rescue-warning-weather-forecast;3
405;405;5652;5652;Arrests after female Muslim activists ‘put up for sale’ in fake auction in India;2022-01-04T13:22:47Z;['Hannah Ellis-Petersen'];['India', 'South and central Asia', 'Gender', 'Religion', 'Internet', 'World news'];"Police in India have detained a woman accused of organising a fake online auction in which hundreds of prominent female Muslims were put up “for sale” on a website. There were shock waves of anger and disgust in India after it emerged that a website calling itself Bulli Bai, an offensive term for Muslims, had set up a pretend auction of more than 100 Muslim women, including journalists, academics, activists, scholars and artists, where they were to be “sold” as servants for negligible sums. Although no real transactions took place, the Bulli Bai website featured photos of the women, many taken from their social media and manipulated. A large number of the women targeted have been vocal critics of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government and many said the purpose of the site was to humiliate and silence outspoken Muslim women and help fracture India down sectarian lines. It is the second recent incident where Muslim women in India have been harassed by being “sold” online, and follows a similar fake auction held online last July. Though several police complaints were filed in that case, no one has been arrested.
The Bulli Bai website was removed within 24 hours, and complaints were filed to the police by victims in Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad. On Tuesday, Mumbai police said they had detained a woman in Uttarakhand who is the main accused, and arrested a male engineering student in Bengaluru after extensive questioning. Sayema Rahman, a popular radio DJ, found out she was among those featured on the website when a screenshot of her name and face was sent to her by a journalist. “The most shocking part is that I’m not shocked any more because this has been happening relentlessly to women for quite some time now, especially with this communal angle,” said Rahman. “It’s Islamophobia coupled with misogyny. I was targeted, and a whole lot of other women were targeted, because we are the vocal voices, we are the liberated voices, and they want to silence us by commodifying us, humiliating us and trying to scare us.” Rahman said victims were still waiting for the prime minister, Narendra Modi, or the central government, in particular the home ministry and the ministry for women, to condemn the Bulli Bai website. “This is a massive national scandal but we are yet to hear a word from the central government condemning this or offering assurances, and that is very unsettling and very unnerving for the safety of women in this country,” she said. Speaking to the Guardian, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the IT minister, said his department’s investigative unit had looked into the website, and those responsible would be prosecuted. “The government of India is committed to ensuring the internet is open, trusted and safe for all Indians. We take this responsibility very seriously,” he said. Khalida Parveen, 67, a veteran activist, was also among the women targeted. On Monday, she filed a police complaint in her home city of Hyderabad against the perpetrators, and the GitHub platform that had facilitated the site. A GitHub spokesperson said it had taken down the user account that had hosted the website, and would cooperate with investigating authorities. Parveen, in her police complaint, called for the perpetrators to be charged with “harassing me, horribly sexualising me, a senior citizen, and casting aspersions on me, and my character, and the community to which I belong” and also to be charged with human trafficking. She said she had been “sad and angry” when she learned she was among those targeted. “What kind of mindset do these people have, selling me, an old lady, and other women online?” Parveen asked. “They are trying to silence our voices on social media. We see again how under this government, Muslim women are targets.” Parveen said she felt the auction aimed to punish prominent female Muslim voices, including journalists and activists, who had called out hate speech against Muslims – such as a recent call by Hindu religious leaders, during a religious event in the Hindu holy city of Haridwar, in Uttarakhand, for a genocide of Muslims in India. “Many of us were on social media, drawing international attention to this hate speech and demanding police cases be filed against the perpetrators,” she said. “Then we are all put up for sale on this auction. I think it is an attempt to scare us, make us fearful to raise our voices so we keep quiet. But we are all fighting this together, we will be aggressive for justice.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/arrests-after-female-muslim-activists-put-up-for-sale-in-fake-auction-in-india;5
406;406;5653;5653;Marjorie Taylor Greene a ‘Democrat or an idiot’, fellow Republican says;2022-01-04T13:19:28Z;['Martin Pengelly'];['Republicans', 'US news', 'US politics', 'Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus'];"The extremist Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene “might be a Democrat – or just an idiot” – according to a fellow hardline conservative.
Dan Crenshaw, a Texas congressman and former Navy Seal, threw the barb back at the Georgia congresswoman in a spat over his support for using the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to operate Covid testing sites. The US is experiencing a crippling surge of Covid cases thanks to the infectious Omicron variant, with more than 1m recorded on Monday and lack of access to testing hampering state and federal responses. Greene has consistently spread Covid conspiracy theories. On Sunday, she was permanently suspended from Twitter, for spreading misinformation. That drew support from Donald Trump, who without discernible irony called Twitter “a disgrace to democracy”, said Greene had “a huge constituency of honest, patriotic, hard-working people”, and added: “Keep fighting, Marjorie!” Regardless, on Monday Greene was temporarily suspended from Facebook, for spreading misinformation. She took aim at Crenshaw on Instagram, writing: “No Fema should not set up testing sites to check for Omicron sneezes, coughs and runny noses. “And we don’t need Fema in hospitals, they should hire back all the unvaccinated [healthcare workers] they fired. “He needs to stop calling himself conservative, he’s hurting our brand.” Crenshaw responded on Instagram, saying: “Hey, Marjorie, if suggesting we should follow Trump policy instead of Biden mandates makes you mad, then you might be a Democrat – or just an idiot.” Greene has been repeatedly fined for failing to wear a mask on the floor of the House of Representatives. Crenshaw, however, has his own history of provocative behaviour. As the Houston Chronicle pointed out, “Before calling for federally funded testing sites, Crenshaw used to share wild posts to social media, before Greene took office, including posting action movie-style videos of him beating up Antifa members.” More than 827,000 people have died in the US from Covid-19.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/marjorie-taylor-greene-spat-republican-dan-crenshaw;4

408;408;5655;5655;Listen to the teachers – we have a plan to keep classrooms open and pupils safe | Rachael Warwick;2022-01-04T13:00:12Z;['Rachael Warwick'];['Coronavirus', 'Education', 'Schools', 'UK news'];"This is not the start to the new year that any of us teachers in England had hoped for: increasing Omicron case numbers and ongoing uncertainty about how this will play out have created a nervous start for us all. As someone responsible for 350 staff working across three schools in south Oxfordshire I continue to be extremely concerned for their health, safety and wellbeing. As someone responsible for 2,700 children and young people I continue to prioritise their entitlement to an education. School leaders have spent the past 21 months of the pandemic balancing these two concerns.
The greatest risk to schools remaining fully open this term is the absence of staff who have to self-isolate because of contracting the virus. Many schools were up against it at the end of last term, forced to combine classes and to use an increasing number of cover staff and supply teachers (if they could find them) to keep classes running and year groups open. I am extremely doubtful that sufficient numbers of retired teachers will return to the profession this term to create the number of extra staff who may be needed. What more can be done to support schools and colleges? Quite a lot, actually. The government should provide ventilation units, free of cost, to all settings that need them: the 7,000 announced on Sunday will not be enough. Schools and colleges should be reimbursed for the additional sums they are spending on supply teachers, as well as other Covid-related costs, from already strained budgets. Ofsted should automatically agree to requests to defer inspections this term as school and college leaders are focused, quite rightly, on managing a crisis situation. Parents and families should ensure their children and young people test twice a week at home, without fail – and we need plentiful supplies of lateral flow tests to distribute to our families to enable them to do this. Exam results tables should be removed again this summer: schools up and down the country have been differently affected by the pandemic at different times, and this will continue to be the case. It’s not fair or appropriate to pretend that we have worked on a level playing field this year.
School and college leaders have shown great leadership throughout the pandemic and will continue to do so. We prioritised keeping our schools open for our most vulnerable children and the children of key workers: our three schools have not been closed at any point during the national lockdowns. We pivoted from remote education to mass testing to managing the process of centre-assessed grades. We continue to be agile and responsive to a fast-changing situation, communicating well and regularly with our staff, students and families, providing reassurance and grounded optimism. There has been much talk about “a lost generation” of children, victims of the Covid pandemic. I refuse to believe that any generation should or will be “lost”. Instead of indulging in hyperbole, perhaps those with the power to make decisions could throw themselves behind those of us on the frontline working to keep young people in school, to maintain their entitlement to an education, to protect their health and wellbeing and to open doors to their futures. There is surely no more compelling call to arms, no more important investment in our future than this.

If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email.
Well done everyone, we made it through to 2022. Has anyone else’s brain lost the ability to distinguish between “holiday at home with the kids” and “lockdown at home with the kids”? After 14 days ‘off’ I am very ready to be somewhere completely silent, and perhaps be able to play a video game for longer than 20 minutes without either being asked for a snack, or falling asleep. There’s a lot to look forward to this year, not least all the big games that we were supposed to be playing in 2021. There are so many open-world timesinks, especially, that I don’t know how anyone is supposed to fit all of them in. If you want to know what I will be doing in late February and the entirety of March, the answer is Elden Ring. Dark Souls meets Breath of the Wild! Get it in my veins! Speaking of Breath of the Wild, the sequel to the most expansive (and, in my opinion, the greatest) Zelda game will be out sometime this year as well. Then there’s Horizon: Forbidden West, a game about a flame-haired female warrior fighting robot dinosaurs, a game that I’m pretty sure I made up in my dreams at the age of 11. Somehow I almost forgot about Starfield, the first big Bethesda game since Fallout 4, an explorable sci-fi universe that I still know tantalisingly little about. Will Mass Effect finally have some competition? – – – Traditionally it takes a few years for new games consoles to bed in, and for developers to really explore what they can achieve with the technology. Though the Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5 had a few standouts last year, by the end of 2022 there’s going to be a proper catalogue of new blockbusters. Of course, actually buying a new console to play them on is still, more than a year after launch, a total scramble. Supply-chain issues and huge demand as a result of ongoing global lockdowns have contributed to a scarcity that has had people frantically hitting refresh on Amazon and Game restocks, mindful that they’ll all be sold out again in minutes (or snapped up by bots, to be resold on eBay at an infuriating mark-up). This problem is likely to persist through 2022, Sony’s CFO Hiroki Totoki has admitted. It’s never been so difficult to buy into the next generation of video games. But then: do you really need to? I have always felt that buying a games console in the first year or two of its life is only necessary if you get a real kick out of technological novelty. For most people, there is no rush. We are long past the time when games became unplayably aged after a few years on the shelves. Though only a few games from my 90s childhood could be unreservedly recommended today – pity anybody coming fresh to GoldenEye on the N64, with its bizarre single-stick controls and muddy graphics – pretty much all of the best games of, say, 2010 are a) still just as good and b) still available to buy. Sometimes I rather miss the thrill I used to get from tracking down a coveted retro game on eBay, or from digging through baskets of cartridges in Japanese game stories in the late 00s and coming across a copy of some obscure sumo-wrestling game I once saw in a copy of Super Play. But it’s also undeniably a good thing that you can instantly download or even stream the vast majority of games released in the last decade, when we used to have to go to such lengths. The video games industry is obsessed with the new. As a technology-driven art form, new tech has always been part of the deal. But now more than ever, it’s not what defines games. If you’ve not got a next-gen console yet, you’re not missing out on much. 95% of the joy of this medium is available to you regardless. What to play
Over the Christmas break I dipped into a few games that I hadn’t found time for over the course of the year, and one that stood out was Unpacking, the story of a life told through the act of moving house. Each chapter presents you with a diorama of a home (a childhood bedroom, a college dorm, a cosy one-bed), into which you must somehow fit all of the stuff jumbled into your cardboard boxes. I found this game soothing – it has an implied narrative that is quite sweet, if also very predictable – until I started playing with my partner, who methodically Tetrised everything on to shelves and surfaces however they would fit, like a psychopath. Given that one of this game’s themes is how to fit your possessions (and therefore your life) in around someone else’s, it felt appropriate that we were low-level arguing about how to arrange a virtual kitchen. Available on: Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One/Series X/S, PC Approximate playtime: 3.5 hours What to read The games industry is busy in-fighting over NFTs, the latest solution-to-a-problem-that-doesn’t-exist from the techbro universe, and also one of the most depressing trends I have encountered in all my years covering this business. Ubisoft has introduced them to its games, but nobody wants to buy them. Square-Enix’s CEO has declared his hopes that they become a major trend, which seems rather ambitious as they have yet to be proven useful for anything except Internet flexing. Having spent several months gaining a better understanding of NFTs and cryptocurrency this year, and listened to a few developers evangelise them (and more developers spit fury over them), I have found no better summary than this Gawker piece about the total soul-deadening dumbness of the entire scene as it stands: “world-altering technology is now in the hands of a culture so aesthetically and spiritually impoverished that it should maybe go back to telling stories around the cooking fire for a while, just to remember how to mean something.” You’ve read the Guardian’s 10 games to look forward to in 2022, right? It is becoming a running joke that every year, about half of the games on it fail to actually come out in the year they’re supposed to. A full 6 of the 10 games I picked for the 2021 list are still unreleased, and one of the 2020 games to watch still isn’t finished. Anyway, if you are looking for more games to look forward to and then be disappointed by when they entirely fail to materialise, Polygon has put out a list of 50.

This week, reader Lawal Muhammad asks: Which recent games made you feel happiest/most content while playing them? For me there are three kinds of game that give me happy brain chemicals: anything involving playing to music (Guitar Hero, Tetris Effect, Rez), which induce a kind of flow-state euphoria; games with predictable, repetitive, gentle rhythms that you can sink right into (Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, old-school Harvest Moon), which create a sense of safety; and absolutely mad nonsense that makes me laugh and gives me something unexpected, feeding my insatiable need for novelty. So the games that made me happiest recently were Psychonauts 2, a game about delving into people’s brains that brought a delightfully weird buffet of different game concepts, visual gags and in-jokes to the table, and It Takes Two, a genre mashup about a divorcing couple that completely changes itself around every hour or so.

410;410;5657;5657;Our sex life was great when our relationship was long-distance. Now we live together, everything has changed;2022-01-04T12:34:46Z;['Pamela Stephenson Connolly'];['Life and style', 'Sex', 'Men', 'Relationships'];I have enjoyed a long-distance relationship with my partner for five years. We are both male and used to enjoy a healthy sex life, often enjoying the time we were together, knowing we would not see each other for a few weeks. Sex seemed to be a reciprocal, affectionate adventure that occasionally included a third person to spice things up. We have since moved in together and now it seems that I am the one doing all the work. Most of the initiation and certainly all of the imagination, seems to be coming from me. I don’t feel he is attracted to me or interested in me physically any more. This weekend, he wanted to go out to a gay sauna, but I didn’t, so he went alone. Which would be fine if we were enjoying a healthy sex life, but we’re not. So the open part has now replaced our own intimate life. I feel that this is a significant change. He won’t talk about it, other than to say I am being insecure, hypocritical or unreasonable. To be honest, I have doubted myself because I too have enjoyed the benefits of the open relationship but only when they were the icing on the cake, not the cake itself. How do I reignite our own sex life? Your disappointment at the lack of ease you are experiencing in segueing into this new phase is understandable, but, for now, you will have to lower your expectations. Such a significant change in a relationship typically requires time and careful negotiation. There is probably nothing wrong with your sex life itself – you just need to discuss your individual needs and desires and try to reach a workable understanding. Some couples are better off not living together, but it is too early to know if you meet that criteria. In addition, all kinds of extra issues arise in open relationships and you will have to tackle these one at a time. Be very specific in your negotiations: you could suggest for example, “Could we agree to take turns initiating sex?” Many relationships – of all types – fail when one partner feels the unspoken contract is an unfair one. And sexual interest can be lowered due to the accompanying underlying resentment. It would be best to address it, gently, as soon as possible.

411;411;5658;5658;French opposition MPs criticised after Covid vaccine pass debate suspended;2022-01-04T12:34:11Z;['Kim Willsher'];['France', 'Coronavirus', 'World news'];"The French government has heavily criticised opposition MPs after a parliamentary debate on the proposed introduction of a “vaccine pass” was unexpectedly suspended after members of the Assemblée nationale voted with a show of hands to go home. The move came after seven hours of often-heated exchanges on Monday, when ministers clashed with critics over the controversial measure due to be introduced on 15 January, but now postponed. Government spokesperson Gabriel Attal on Tuesday accused opposition MPs of playing politics and halting the adoption of what he said were “essential measures … in an urgent situation”. He said the government would push on with the controversial legislation. The proposal is to turn the current “health pass” requiring either vaccination, recovery from Covid or a negative Covid test into a “vaccine pass” requiring people to be fully vaccinated if they wish to access restaurants, bars, museums, cinemas, theatres, long distance trains, hotels and many other public places. Hospitals and health establishments would not require a “vaccine pass”. The debate, which began on Monday afternoon, was due to continue into the early hours of Tuesday and there were more than 500 amendments still to be debated when the parliamentary session was suspended shortly before midnight.
Earlier, the prime minister, Jean Castex, had told the house the government could not accept that 5.3 million people remained unvaccinated in France. The new pass was intended to introduce “heavier constraints on the non-vaccinated”, he admitted. France is currently reporting an average of around 160,000 new Covid cases a day. “The tidal wave has indeed arrived. It’s enormous, but we will not give in to panic,” the health minister, Olivier Véran, told MPs. Facing vehement attacks from the far right Rassemblement National (RN) and far left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed – LFI) over the infringement of civil liberties, Véran added “selfishness often hides behind talk of supposed liberties”. Most MPs from Emmanuel Macron’s centrist La République en Marche (La REM) party and the mainstream opposition Les Républicains (LR) support the measure. “Last night we saw a form of irresponsible friendship being formed with the MPs of La France Insoumise, the Rassemblement National and LR to derail the timetable for the adoption of the vaccine pass,” Attal told France Inter radio. “The vaccine pass has to come into effect as quickly as possible,” Attal added. Far left presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon of LFI, who had called for the new legislation to be rejected, accused the government of having “sown indescribable chaos because of your short-sightedness” and accused Véran of “arrogance”. He called for “a global plan” and poured scorn on “measures on those who have the right to eat popcorn or drink their coffee standing or sitting”. Critics also accused the government, which is one-seat short of an absolute parliamentary majority, of amateurism after it found itself without enough MPs present in the lower house to defeat the vote to suspend. Alexis Corbière of LFI said members of the governing party were to blame for the stalemate. “LREM MPs weren’t sufficiently mobilised last night and found themselves in a minority. It’s absolutely their fault,” he tweeted. The new legislation would also introduce heavier penalties for those using fake vaccine passes or venues that fail to check people’s vaccine status of up to five years in prison and €75,000 (£63,000) fines.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/french-opposition-mps-criticised-after-vaccine-pass-debate-suspended;1
412;412;5659;5659;Metteson: the Norwegian theatre kid embracing pop, pleasure and pain;2022-01-04T12:30:12Z;['Alim Kheraj'];['Pop and rock', 'Music', 'Culture', 'Theatre', 'Stage'];"When Norwegian pop star Metteson was 18, he had an experience at a festival that made him understand the visceral impact music can have. While Emeli Sandé was performing Heaven, he kissed the boy he’d had a crush on for ages. “I wasn’t on drugs but I was as high as I’ve ever been and I had what was sort of my first sexual experience,” he says. “But the day after, I got brutally dumped when he told me that he was in love with someone else. The picture of the night before exploded and cracked.” Feeling jilted, he went to watch Lana Del Rey: “She sang Summertime Sadness and I was crying all alone. Both those of those songs have stuck with me. They’re emotional triggers and I wallow in them. I just love when music really pushes experiences to another level.” Metteson’s own music feels destined to soundtrack similar scenes. Now 28, he creates kaleidoscopic pop that is unashamedly grand and theatrical. His debut EP, 2021’s Convince Me, flirted with the Scandinavian synth melancholia popularised by Robyn and the Knife, while also pulling from the arty chamber pop of Patrick Wolf as well as Whitney Houston and George Michael. His most recent single, the sumptuous Under Your Shirt, is a symphonic yet tender devotional that perfectly captures the sparks of intimacy and the heart-pounding ache of yearning.
“I tried early on to make more compact melodies and cool club music,” says Metteson, “but I would whack on a big refrain because that’s what the emotion calls for. I’m not a whispery, cool and gritty singer. Whether that big refrain comes packaged as a club banger or a piano ballad, I want it to be a representation of myself.” Born Sverre Breivik and raised in the coastal town of Moss in Norway, Metteson – the name literally meaning the son of Mette, his mother – was always a creative kid. He was enrolled in various theatre and music groups and later studied at the National Academy of the Arts in Oslo. “I was a triple threat,” he laughs. “I was the loud, musical theatre kid, and I really think I bring a lot of that into my music now.” Since graduating, he has worked as a repertory actor at the National Theatre in Bergen. When we speak, he is just finishing up a run as Prior Walter in Tony Kushner’s Aids epic Angels in America – “one of the first shows that I ever saw and thought that there was a place for me in the world of theatre,” he adds. “It’s been a big deal for me.” Metteson initially struggled with his sexuality. “I can remember knowing from a very early age that I was different and that I liked boys; wearing women’s clothing and sensing that was, in some way, wrong,” he recalls. He remained closeted until he moved to Oslo to study. “It wasn’t a prison, but I regret it. Now I’m discovering the joy and the pleasures of being young.” His new music, due in the coming months, is evidence that he has taken that leap: building on the grandeur of Under Your Shirt, songs like Never Let Me Go and the baroque Second Heart run on melodrama and escapism. He also supports fellow Norwegian pop star Aurora on her UK tour this spring, a chance for British audiences to get a taste of that newfound freedom in action with his sensual performances (think a poppier Perfume Genius). “I think I make music that’s made to be experienced live,” he says. “I hope that I can blow people away with a perfect pop experience.”";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/04/metteson-the-norwegian-theatre-kid-embracing-pop-pleasure-and-pain;5
413;413;5660;5660;Burger King becomes first UK fast food restaurant chain to offer vegan nuggets;2022-01-04T12:10:55Z;['Mark Sweney', 'Sarah Butler'];['Burger King', 'Food & drink industry', 'Business', 'Vegan food and drink', 'Food', 'UK news'];"Burger King UK is to launch vegan nuggets nationwide from Wednesday as the fast food chain evolves its meat-focused menu to cash in on the booming popularity of plant-based diets. The chain, which two years ago launched a plant-based Rebel Whopper burger that turned out not to be suitable for vegans because it was cooked on the same grill as meat, is the first major fast-food restaurant in the UK to offer an animal-product-free version of nuggets. The company says the product, which has been developed by The Vegetarian Butcher and certified by the Vegan Society, is made from soy and plant proteins only and tastes the same as its meat originals.
Burger King, which last year launched a Vegan Royale burger that is prepared separately from animal products, aims to make half of its menu meat-free by 2030 to help it achieve a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 41%. “Adapting to customer preferences is a key focus at Burger King,” said the Burger King UK chief executive, Alasdair Murdoch. “We are committed to helping our guests make good decisions about what they eat and drink and providing them with informed choices.” Murdoch said the move marked a response to the growing nationwide demand for meatless alternatives and products with no animal protein in the UK. The bakery chain Greggs has experienced huge success with its push into vegan foods, most notably its bestselling Quorn-filled sausage rolls, with demand outstripping supply when it first launched the product three years ago. A record number of people are expected to try to eat only plant-based foods this month, as growing environmental concerns heighten interest in the Veganuary movement.
A rising number of mainstream food purveyors are backing the movement. Aldi said it was introducing its largest ever vegan range including croissants, mushroom bolognese and vegan cheese, while KFC is permanently bringing back the vegan burger it first tried out last year. This year, more than 40 companies, including Harrod’s, Superdrug and Volkswagen UK, are taking part in a Veganuary “workplace challenge” to make more vegan food available in the workplace and run events to support participating staff. More than 50,000 products have been certified by the Vegan Society, with new products including a Babybel made from coconut oil and starch, and an almond and oat-based Philadelphia spread. • The headline and text of this article were amended on 24 January 2022.

414;414;5661;5661;American Siege review – Bruce Willis sleepwalks through a thriller without thrills;2022-01-04T12:00:12Z;['Cath Clarke'];['Film', 'Thrillers', 'Action and adventure films', 'Bruce Willis', 'Culture'];"‘This is Georgia,” drawls a character near the start of this tiresome, oddly dull action thriller. “Everyone’s doing something they’re not supposed to be doing.” But the problem with Bruce Willis in the movie is that he’s not doing something that he is supposed to be doing: acting. He puts in a such a wooden performance playing a washed-up, burnt-out cop that I could have screamed in frustration.
American Siege is set 10 years after the mysterious disappearance in a backwater town of teenager Brigit Baker (played in flashback by Sarah May Sommers). Brigit’s boyfriend Roy (Rob Gough) has spent the past decade in prison; now he wants the truth. Armed to the teeth, he storms the house of a local pharmacist, accompanied by Brigit’s sister Grace and her cousin Toby. This pair don’t do much for Hicksville stereotypes: Grace (Anna Hindman) is a gun-toting redneck in a white vest, Georgia’s answer to Sarah Connor; Toby (Johann Urb) is Bible-thumping and paranoid. The trio believes that the pharmacist (Cullen G Chambers) knows what happened to Brigit – and judging from the bank-grade security door on his basement, he’s up to something shady.
Enter Willis as Sheriff Ben Watts, who doubles as the town drunk. Willis gets the lines out, but there are scenes here where his acting is so lethargic you’d think director Edward Drake might have called cut to check for for a pulse. Watts is lazy, corrupt and on the payroll of powerful local businessman Charles Rutledge (Timothy V Murphy, giving good icy menace). Rutledge seems to be connected with the central mystery too. And to be fair, the script gives us a missing-girl storyline with an interesting (though not entirely thought out) twist. But the movie ends with a long boring standoff outside the pharmacist’s house, Roy and his gang up against a private militia led by a guy who looks like a buff Steve Bannon. • American Siege is released on 10 January on digital platforms.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/04/american-siege-review-bruce-willis;5
415;415;5662;5662;Cultivating calm: how gardening helps me find peace;2022-01-04T12:00:12Z;['Rebecca Nicholson'];['Gardening advice', 'Gardens', 'Vegetables', 'Food', 'Mental health', 'Plants', 'Health', 'Hobbies'];"It was the runner beans that did it. My neighbour, who is in her 90s, dropped round an envelope filled with a small handful of dried beans, which looked as if they’d been dipped in pink and black paint. A few months later, I was eating the best runner beans I’ve ever tasted, and they kept coming, for weeks and weeks. We gave bunches and bunches away, ate more, learned that you have to de-string them, and then finally, recently, when the plants started to look tired, let them dry out, and saved the seeds for next year’s batch. I have a restless mind and I have tried everything to quieten it. Running, meditation, yoga. Working hard, hardly working. I have repeatedly listened to the app that’s meant to ground you, only to float off on a cloud of guilt for not being able to concentrate on it for long enough. But gardening works like nothing else has. I can nip into the garden for five minutes and find that three hours have passed. I don’t look at my phone. I tend not to worry or fret. And I can eat (most of) the spoils. For most of my adult life, I lived in rented flats in London, never in one place long enough to be certain of seeing a seasonal cycle through. Outdoor space was a rarity and a luxury. During the first lockdown, in another flat with no garden, I went for it anyway. A few herbs on every window ledge, mostly the easy ones, parsley and mint, but a few tomato plants, too, grown from seed, surprisingly hardy on the roof of a bay window belonging to the flat below. Then I and my partner fled the city, moved to a town and a small house with a garden at the back and front, loved at one time, but largely left to their own devices in recent years. It had become a foliage battle royale, and the winner turned out to be ivy, which was everywhere. It needed some work. It was a big job. And then one day, we got stuck in. What a simple pleasure, to have a reason to be outside whenever it was light and dry, to get mucky from digging and tired from lifting, to watch as a bed we had toiled hard to clear revealed itself over time, with nature’s underrated sense of humour, to be harbouring snowdrops and daffodils and tulips, buried far deeper than the fork had gone.
To find garlic under shrubs, remnants of forgotten veg patches, to see peonies, roses, crocosmia, Mexican orange blossom, all insistent they would be making an appearance, thank you very much, despite being untended by human hands for years. Every one of them was a small marvel, a lesson in resilience. People say that bakers are sharers by nature. I think gardeners are the same. The neighbour who gave us runner beans also gave us spectral pale green nicotianas, spider plant babies that have since given birth to their own, a pepper plant that is now indoors and has just given up a late ripened red pepper. Another neighbour dropped off cucumbers that had done far better than my own. As we attempted to wrangle the semi-rewilded front garden into some sort of shape, someone brought out a wheelbarrow, in case we needed it, while someone else offered the use of the skip he’d hired for his own garden clearout. Ah, I thought. This is what community feels like. You’re supposed to leave a garden for a year, I read, to see what’s there, but I couldn’t wait that long. I got some pretty flowers going from seed – some neon-pink sweetpeas, cosmos that look like fireworks (not individually known as a single “cosmo”, as I discovered when I tried to show off about them) – but it was the fruit and veg, mostly veg, that were the biggest revelations. In a miserable year, being able to go into the garden and pick dinner was miraculous. On the night I made garden ratatouille, every ingredient grown by us, the onion, garlic, pepper, tomatoes, courgettes, herbs, I felt a satisfaction that cheers me up when I think about it today, even though most of those plants have long since gone on to the compost heap.
As a hobby, gardening is not cheap (to start with, though the amount of recycling and reusing that goes on makes it easier as you go), and it’s not quick, but it is calming, and it is soothing, and it is useful. Being able to give people lettuce from the garden when the supermarket shelves were running short felt good. It was my own tiny taste of being a doomsday prepper, and though I’m not sure how much call there will be for salad at the end of the world, it’s nice to know that I could still have some Drunken Woman lettuce if I wanted it. It is becoming all-consuming. It’s getting out of hand. I went to the Chelsea flower show this year, for the first time, and came back with a bagful of bulbs and seeds, largely chosen for what they were called and whether they looked funny. I am working my way through the RHS level 2 qualification in horticulture, studying soil improvement and trying to remember how photosynthesis works. But I am not a good gardener yet, or a knowledgeable one. I am a beginner, basic, learning as I go by rolling up my sleeves. In most situations, in the other parts of my life, I can be uptight. I hate it. But if I’m not sure what to do in the garden, I’ll phone my mum. Her advice is often to just stick it in the ground and see. What’s the worst that could happen? It doesn’t work, you learn something, you try again. That approach has its uses far beyond the flowerbed. How to do it The Royal Horticultural Society has a database of local gardening groups and It’s Your Neighbourhood groups, while the BBC has an excellent resource for people looking to set up a community garden. Also check out Social Farms & Gardens, a charity which provides advice, funding and training for community gardeners. The National Allotment Society has helpful tips on finding an allotment. Garden Organic’s Heritage Seed Library and Seed Sovereignty are good places to find unusual seeds to sow once you have your space. If you want to visit a garden without the faff of digging it, look at the National Open Garden Scheme – it details remarkable private gardens to visit across the UK and raises funds for health charities. To gen up, try Christopher Lloyd’s 1997 The Well-Tempered Garden,is a classic that’s stood the test of time for new gardeners. If you have vision but no space, try Alice Vincent’s book Rootbound to hear how the author got into urban gardening. Thoughtful Gardening by Robin Lane Fox offers practical advice while adding meditative and illuminating anecdotes from art and literature. Poppy Okotcha’s The Earth Food Handbook and website are fascinating accounts of the horticulturalist’s work creating an edible and medicinal forest garden in Devon.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/cultivating-calm-how-gardening-helps-me-find-peace;7
416;416;5663;5663;Make a splash: the challenge of learning to kayak;2022-01-04T12:00:11Z;['Kitty Empire'];['Canoeing and kayaking holidays', 'Hobbies', 'Life and style', 'Travel'];"For as long as I have run, I have hoofed unathletically alongside canals and rivers – I come out in hives if I breathe too hard near roads. And for as long as I have been a towpath user, I have looked enviously at the people in canoes and kayaks, slicing through the water, eye level with the moorhens. One day, I might give kayaking a go, I thought, vaguely. Sit-on-top kayaks always made for a far better day at the beach on holiday. Rowing itself never seemed remotely attractive – too much ruling class baggage, too much shouting. But in a kayak, I thought, you might wander pacifically about in nature, maybe spot some riverbank wildlife you don’t normally see and, almost as an afterthought, perhaps build a little upper body strength. Kismet intervened a few years ago. The firstborn expressed a desire to join the local canoe club. After navigating a waiting list, I signed up for an introductory adult course. And another.
There was basic handling in boats you couldn’t tip over if you tried. We learned about different types of canoe and kayak; different paddles – never oars! – the various paddle strokes. We learned to keep “river right” and how to self-rescue if you fall in – not fun in winter, but necessary as hitting cold water can shock the body, and disorient even a strong swimmer. It was, mostly, fun. It got me outdoors. I wasn’t in a rut, exactly – I had plenty going on – but it was the best kind of challenge: completely new to me, different from all the things I would do normally, and neither extreme nor ridiculous. Women were well-represented. The club actively welcomed the differently abled. It wasn’t all buff 23-year-olds, it was retirees, kids, lots of people of all ages who had recovered from something. I soon had triceps to speak of. Yes, there was the danger of river pollution and Weil’s disease, but with every dunking, I got more used to being plastered in weed.
Our local club happens to be a racing club rather than a touring club. Beyond the introductory course, very little pacific meandering goes on. You are still eye-level with waterfowl, but ducks scatter before you, letting their indignation be known. I signed up for the racing course. And then joined the club. I started with the kids. Eventually, a group of newer adults and younger teens coalesced. We learned racing technique, how to carry our kayaks over locks – portaging – and, later, wash-hanging (slip-streaming in the wake of another kayak to conserve energy). We learned – well, others learned – how to turn anticlockwise at speed around buoys. We did “fartleks” – interval training in which you leap-frog one another to build up sprint speeds. We trained for stamina over distance. We sharpened our technique, using the leg drive against the kayak footplate to power the stroke. We learned that a successful stroke requires shoulder and torso rotation, not just pulling with the arms. We did race starts; time trial after time trial. Every time I lost concentration or was issued a new kayak, I fell in. It has been character-building. Like most new habits, training is about turning up and just getting a little less worse, over time. And that is how I came to be lining up, my son’s too-tight old club race vest under my buoyancy aid, number board attached to my kayak, at the starting line of my first five-mile marathon a few weeks ago. To be clear: I run for trains and buses, and I run for the endorphin rush and the improved sleep. I have never raced. I’m not uncompetitive, exactly, I just don’t go in for gung-ho stuff. But having stepped a little outside my comfort zone, I now found myself surrounded by a bevy of far more experienced entrants, being buffeted by 12mph winds, a stranger to myself. I had – ugh – carb-loaded. I had even (whisper it) sucked down a gel.
Waiting for the signal, I wobbled about perilously. It was partly me, partly the kayak. Built for speed, racing kayaks are inherently unstable, not suited to sitting still. And I wasn’t even in a fast boat. I had progressed from a broad-bottomed stability 10 craft to something like a stability six. The stability threes and twos are like stiletto heels; the ones are like hypodermic needles. The people who race in those have pencil hips and abs made of titanium. I have borne children and my core is made of pasta. That pasta might be a little more al dente than it was a few years ago, but not by much. The experienced racers shot off; I was left in the churn, but upright. Gradually, I found my pace. I think I overtook someone. Fast children overtook me. I didn’t mess up the first turn: major win. I didn’t mess up the portage, or the second turn. More tiny victories. When it was windy, I kept my paddle low. When the gusts eased, I tried to coordinate legs, arms, torso and breath to move faster. Sometimes, for a minute or so, I was almost alone on the water, almost at one with the boat, limbs miraculously in sync. The feeling of flying as the prow split the water sparkling in the dappled sunshine was the stuff of cliche, but no less true for it. I limped in, penultimate in my class, arms like frankfurters, fingers like claws. But I hadn’t fallen in. And now I have a race time. And next time, I might beat it. How to do it British Canoeing is the national governing body for paddle sports. It can put you in touch with the 400-plus certified clubs in the UK, including women’s paddle sports groups. Access Adventures is a charity that aims to make sports accessible and affordable for everyone with a disability. These sorts of sports typically involve group activities, many are suitable for families, so it’s a sociable pastime with lots of events. Forums such as the Open Canoe Association, GoPaddling and the UK Rivers Guidebook are sources of information about meet-ups, mentors and trips. If you like the idea of spending time in, on or even under the water, there are lots of options. Try the British Water Ski and Wakeboard Association, British Rafting, the National Coasteering Charter, the Inland Waterways Association, the British Sub-Aqua Club or even the underwater hockey club – the British Octopush Association – for trial sessions and local group information.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/make-a-splash-the-challenge-of-learning-to-kayak;4
417;417;5664;5664;The Spin | Six cricket wishes for 2022: from T20 World Cup to women’s Ashes glory;2022-01-04T12:00:11Z;['Tim de Lisle'];['Cricket', 'Sport', 'England cricket team', 'Jofra Archer', 'T20 World Cup'];"With the Ashes gone, England’s Test team are in what could be tactfully described as some disarray. But where there is despair, let us sow hope. A year ago, The Spin expressed six wishes for 2021, and most of them came true. Cricket’s gates did reopen, Michael Holding did have a bestseller, Ireland did keep busy and New Zealand did become world Test champions. One wish went badly awry: Zak Crawley never came close to a second Test century, and for someone who can play so regally, 2021 was an annus horribilis.
Another was only half-fulfilled: Mark Wood did get more Tests – seven in the calendar year, the most for him since 2015 – but appeared only once against India and was perplexingly rested in Adelaide last month, just when his speed was unsettling Australia’s best batters. Still, as the players say, we go again. Here are six wishes for 2022. 1) England reset Joe Root, who has been wrong about most things in Australia, is right about this. England need to rethink their red-ball cricket, just as they did with the white-ball game in 2015. That operation had two masterminds: Andrew Strauss, England’s then managing director, who saw the need for it, and Eoin Morgan, the incoming white-ball captain, who made it happen by turning a team with no identity into fearless master-blasters. Transforming the Test team will take brains. The squad needs a natural captain, someone steely and crafty, not smiley and woolly. The whole set-up needs a boss with more vision and verve than Ashley Giles, who has made his mark only by getting rid of the biggest brain in the England brains trust, Ed Smith. As national selector, Smith had a win/loss ratio in Tests of 1.75 (won 21, lost 12). His successor, Chris Silverwood, has a ratio of 0.17 (won one, lost six). The fixture list has been tough, the Covid protocols taxing, but that is still a steep decline. Giles’s job should revert to Strauss, who relinquished it for personal reasons when his wife, Ruth, was dying of cancer. If he is only available part-time, the ECB can say “No problem”. It is a job that mainly consists of hiring people for other jobs lower down, though Strauss has the clarity and clout to change the mindset of those above him, too. He might even persuade them to turn down those mind-boggling bonuses.
2) The T20 World Cup is not ruled by the toss Yes, there’s another one coming up, a year after the last. In October, Australia, the surprise winners, will defend the trophy on their own soil in what should be a more satisfying tournament. In the UAE the toss held too much sway: all six of Australia’s victories came batting second. By the end they were probably playing well enough to win batting first, but they never got to prove it. England, the only team to beat them, started sublimely but ran out of steam, lost Jason Roy to injury and succumbed to New Zealand in the semi-final. That should spur them on, along with the knowledge they can be the first men’s team to hold both World Cups at once. 3) England win the Ashes The women’s Ashes, that is. The series covers all three international formats, a scenario England’s men can only envy. It begins on 26 January with a single Test, followed by three T20s and three ODIs. Australia’s women rule the world, so wresting the Ashes from them on their own turf is mission almost impossible. But the England captain, Heather Knight, has a gifted squad who have been battle-hardened by the big crowds in the Hundred. And they have plenty more to play for later in the year. Straight after the Ashes, there’s the World Cup in New Zealand, with England arriving as the holders. Halfway through the home season come the Commonwealth Games (in Birmingham, from 28 July), which will feature T20 cricket for the first time – with no men to hog the headlines.
4) Racism is given out A month ago, Yorkshire seemed to be finally cleaning out the stables after their dismal response to Azeem Rafiq’s allegations of racism. They laid off all their coaching staff and brought in Darren Gough as managing director of cricket. Since then it has gone all quiet on the northern front. This could be because the players threatened to quit: Gough may be talking to them behind closed doors. Let’s hope that if push comes to shove he is prepared to let them go and start afresh, building a new team around Adil Rashid, who is too good not to be playing four-day cricket (assuming his shoulder can stand it). And let’s hope the rest of English cricket becomes more inclusive. Every team, professional or amateur, can help by taking the knee. Sky can help by giving the commentary spot vacated by David Lloyd to Mark Butcher, not just because he’s mixed-race, but because he’s top-class – shrewd, lucid and witty. 5) England work out how to play New Zealand
If you can’t beat ’em, copy ’em. Morgan’s blueprint for buccaneering was borrowed from his mate Brendon McCullum, who was the New Zealand captain at the time. In Tests these days the Kiwis are everything England are not: canny, efficient, clear-thinking. They are the only team Root has never beaten as captain (played six; lost three, drawn three) and they are coming over again for three Tests in June. We don’t know who will be in charge of England by then, but we do know they will have to work out how to deal with Tim Southee’s swing, Kyle Jamieson’s bounce and Neil Wagner’s belligerence – and how to ape New Zealand’s ability to punch above their weight. 6) Jofra Archer comes steaming in England’s most exciting discovery since Ben Stokes has not played for them since March and if he goes to the Caribbean it will be to see his family. Archer will soon have lost a whole year to a stress fracture of the right elbow. Some have doubted whether he will play another Test, but the man himself doesn’t seem to be among them. On Australia’s Channel 7 at the start of the Ashes, Archer said: “This is really one cricket tour as a fast bowler that you don’t want to miss.” Quizzed about his recuperation, he said: “Everything’s been moving forward nicely.” He’ll be back.

418;418;5665;5665;Millions of UK critical workers could get priority Covid tests;2022-01-04T11:54:30Z;['Jessica Elgot'];['Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'UK news', 'Health', 'NHS', 'Teaching', 'Education', 'Society'];"Millions of critical workers in the UK could get priority Covid testing through their employers under a draft plan designed to tackle staff shortages. Amid concerns over testing availability, ministers have drawn up a prioritisation list including health workers and those working in critical infrastructure. The plan, first reported by the Daily Telegraph, is expected to be signed off by ministers early this week with pressure mounting on key services as schools return and services such as waste collection and transport resume normal schedules after the Christmas break. A No 10 source confirmed there was a prioritisation plan drawn up but said there was no plan for imminent implementation, saying they believed the plans for testing was robust, despite widespread difficulties with home deliveries and pharmacy supplies of lateral flow tests. It comes after the British Medical Association and Royal College of Nursing called for health staff to be prioritised for rapid tests to ease staffing issues. Millions of testing kits are to be delivered to schools this week and headteachers can already order via a channel for pupils and staff to test twice a week. However, critical businesses including police, transport workers and haulage could also be given access to priority testing under the plans. An unprecedented demand for tests has been driven by the government allowing vaccinated people out of self-isolation if they show repeated negative lateral flow test results after a week, and among those stocking up on kits before New Year’s Eve events. A government spokesperson said: “The UK’s testing programme is the biggest in Europe and record numbers are being delivered to pharmacies, homes and those who need them. “The NHS has additional stock of lateral flow tests and those who live or work in vulnerable settings have access to dedicated testing order routes. If at some point it is necessary to do so we will always prioritise protecting the most vulnerable as well as critical workforces, as we have done throughout the pandemic when it comes to vaccines, boosters, testing and other infection control measures such as PPE.”
The minister for vaccines and public health, Maggie Throup, said she was not sure how many Britons were currently in self-isolation. She told Sky News: “I’m not sure of that [actual] figure, but I think what’s shown over Christmas is that a lot of people have caught the disease, the Omicron variant is very transmissible, but what is good news, it doesn’t seem to be resulting in severe diseases as some of the other variants did.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/millions-of-uk-critical-workers-could-get-priority-covid-tests;1
419;419;5666;5666;Prince Andrew’s lawyers to urge judge to dismiss sexual assault lawsuit;2022-01-04T11:39:05Z;['Caroline Davies'];['Prince Andrew', 'Ghislaine Maxwell', 'Jeffrey Epstein', 'Monarchy', 'UK news', 'US news', 'World news'];A US judge is to hear arguments by the Duke of York’s legal representatives to have the sexual assault civil lawsuit brought against him dismissed without trial in a crucial New York hearing. Prince Andrew, 61, is being sued by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, 38, for alleged sexual assault that she claims took place when she was aged 17 and had been trafficked by the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew’s legal team will on Tuesday argue before Judge Lewis Kaplan that the case is baseless and should be thrown out. The hearing, by video teleconference, comes the day after a previously confidential 12-page document was made public disclosing the terms of a $500,000 settlement agreement in 2009 by Epstein to Giuffre. The prince’s lawyers are expected to argue the agreement means Giuffre has relinquished any rights to sue anyone connected to Epstein who could be described as a “potential defendant”. The settlement, which relates to a Florida state case to which the prince was not a party, states Giuffre agreed to “release, acquit, satisfy, and forever discharge” Epstein and “any other person or entity” who could have been included as a potential defendant. Though the document does not mention Andrew by name, Andrew B Brettler, who represents Andrew, has said the settlement should end the lawsuit. Brettler previously told the New York court that the agreement “releases Prince Andrew and others from any purported liability arising from the claims Ms Giuffre asserted against Prince Andrew here”. However, Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, argued the settlement was “irrelevant to the case against Prince Andrew”. Giuffre is seeking unspecified damages claiming she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with Andrew when she was 17 and a minor under US law. The prince has denied all the allegations. His legal team have described Giuffre’s claims as “baseless” and alleged she is seeking a “payday” at the royal’s expense. Kaplan last week denied a motion from Andrew’s lawyers to halt the civil proceedings while the issue of where Giuffre lives is dealt with. The crunch hearing comes one week after Andrew’s former friend Ghislaine Maxwell, 60, a sometime girlfriend of Epstein’s, was convicted of charges relating to recruiting and trafficking teenage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse. Lawyers for Maxwell, who faces a lengthy prison sentence, plan to appeal. It is not known if Kaplan will make his decision on whether to dismiss Giuffre’s lawsuit on Tuesday or announce it at a later date. Lawyers for Giuffre have requested documents as part of her litigation, such as proof of Andrew’s claim that he cannot sweat. Giuffre has claimed the duke was “sweating profusely all over me” at a London discotheque on a night when she alleges they had sex. Andrew said in his Newsnight interview the allegation could not be true “because I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time”. The prince also maintained that on the day cited by Giuffre he took his daughter Beatrice to a late-afternoon children’s party at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking, Surrey. After that, he said, he was at home with his children all night.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/prince-andrew-lawyers-urge-judge-dismiss-sexual-assault-lawsuit;1
420;420;5667;5667;One-party rule is now the credo of Trump and his followers | Lloyd Green;2022-01-04T11:38:11Z;['Lloyd Green'];['Republicans', 'US news', 'Donald Trump', 'World news', 'Joe Biden', 'Democrats', 'US Capitol attack'];"The first anniversary of the invasion of the Capitol approaches, our cold civil war grows hotter by the day, and the numbers tell the story. A majority of Republicans view the attack as a defense of freedom (56%) and just under half (47%) cast it as an act of patriotism. For good measure, one in six Americans approve of the events of 6 January 2021, including nearly a quarter of Republicans.
America’s Reichstag fire continues to smolder. A staggering 64% of Americans believe democracy here is “in crisis and at risk of failing”. Beyond that, two-thirds of Republicans agree that “voter fraud helped Joe Biden win the 2020 election”. Disturbingly but not surprisingly, the Republican party’s credo is now “heads I win, tails you lose”. Then again, the last time a non-incumbent Republican won the presidential popular vote was George HW Bush in 1988. The fact that recent Republican-backed post-election “audits” have failed to yield a different outcome, has not dulled the party faithful’s devotion to the false and Trump-driven proposition that the election was stolen. From the looks of things, the Republican party’s fealty to democracy appears tenuous at best, no longer willing to accept the finality of the ballot box or the courts. Even after the insurrection, the majority of congressional Republicans opposed certifying the election. And the base is definitely with them. Donald Trump leads all challengers for the 2024 Republican nomination. He leads his closest rival, Florida governor Ron DeSantis, by more than 40 points. Trumpism is more than a cult: it is a movement. In that same spirit, Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene, Louie Gohmert and Matt Gaetz lie at the party’s enraged and performative core. During the last 12 months, these attitudes have managed to congeal and fester. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger are outliers in a party driven by and suffused with grievance. Cheney is dead-on when she says the choice is between the constitution and Trump. But it is only the coastal elites who are listening. During the 2016 campaign, Paul LePage, then governor of Maine, thought Trump needed to show some “authoritarian power”. The Republican party knew who it was getting and what it wanted. Back in the day, Republican congressional leaders ushered Richard Nixon to the door. Now, crossing Trump is met with the prospect of a primary or the inevitable resignation. In Georgia, Trump is supporting the opponents of Brian Kemp, the incumbent Republican governor, and Brad Raffensperger, the incumbent secretary state, because they declined to bend to his will. In the aftermath of the election, they refused to “find” votes for Trump where there were none to be found despite relentless pressure from the White House or to overturn the will of their state’s voters. Indeed, Trump’s phone call to Raffensperger was a key event in Trump’s second impeachment. Fittingly, on Monday Trump issued his “complete support and endorsement” for the re-election bid of Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister and an outright proponent of “illiberal democracy”. In office, Orbán has curbed the press and tilted his country’s constitution and laws in his personal favor. One-party rule is his goal. Think of Mar-a-Lago along the Danube and you get the picture. Beyond that, Orbán has thrust blood, soil and Christianity into the forefront of Hungarian politics, to the approval of name-brand Republicans. Mike Pence, Trump’s vice-president, and Jeff Sessions, Trump’s discarded attorney general, have travellled to Budapest and paid homage to Orbán and conservative social values. Likewise, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson spent time broadcasting from Hungary. The nexus between the Republican party and religion grows at a moment in time when fewer Americans can be found in the pews, and religious “nones” occupy a growing space in public debate and the Democratic party. Frequency of worship is as valid a predictor of how white Americans will vote as any other. It is no longer a simple matter of denominational affiliation. In a sense, America is enveloped in a bloodless but rage-filled 16th-century-styled religious war. Meanwhile, for all of Biden’s campaign rhetoric about bridging our political chasm, his presidency has failed to narrow the breadth and intensity of the partisan divide. Booming job and stock markets have not papered over the country’s fault lines, which have only grown deeper and more acrid during his tenure. And it is not just the debacle in Afghanistan or even inflation. On that score, the 46th president and his allies refuse to acknowledge that in US politics if you want to move to the left on economics, you had better move to the center on social issues. Culture still counts – a lot. The lessons of triangulation taught by Bill Clinton three decades ago remain valid. Sadly, the realities that brought America to its present inflection point are not disappearing any time soon. Tribe, place and resentment stand to define and drive our politics for as far as the eye can see. Barrington Moore Jr once said, “No bourgeoisie, no democracy,” and these days, the middle class feels buffeted by forces outside its control. A recent Republican fundraising missive framed the debate in the US as between Americans and Democrats. So, this is where we are. Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York.

421;421;5668;5668;Brexit and Covid hit demand for exports from UK factories;2022-01-04T11:31:55Z;['Richard Partington'];['Manufacturing data', 'Manufacturing sector', 'Economics', 'Brexit', 'Business', 'UK news'];"Britain’s manufacturers have suffered a drop in export demand amid pressure from Covid and Brexit, according to fresh data that shows supply chain disruption and staff shortages held back the economy in December. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) showed growth in UK factory output was limited last month by Covid restrictions and Brexit weighing on orders and pushing up costs. According to the survey of 650 manufacturers, which is tracked by the government and the Bank of England for early warning signs from the economy, inflows of new work from overseas dropped for the fourth month in a row.
While firms reported continued growth at the end of last year and a slight easing of supply chain delays, manufacturers said logistics issues, Brexit difficulties and the possibility of further pandemic restrictions at home and overseas had damaged export demand at the end of the year. New trade restrictions since leaving the EU and the impact of the pandemic mean that Britain’s exporters are on track to be the slowest among big European economies to recover from Covid-19, according to research by Euler Hermes. The Paris-based trade credit insurer forecasts UK exports will not recover to pre-pandemic levels until 2023, leaving the UK lagging European counterparts, with data expected to show that Germany and Italy have already recovered in 2021 and other nations will do in 2022. The forecast comes despite a rise in demand for manufactured goods across advanced economies as consumers turn to purchasing physical products while pandemic restrictions limit appetite for services. Ana Boata, the head of economic research at Euler Hermes, said: “Our forecasts show that Brexiting in times of Covid-19 has hindered exporters’ capacity to benefit from the strong upswing in demand that lockdown has presented.” She said fresh post-Brexit border controls on UK imports at the start of 2022 would bring further disruption, while the Omicron coronavirus variant would add to severe uncertainty facing firms. “British exporters have been tasked with sailing increasingly perilous trade waters in recent years – another 12 months of headwinds could be enough to sink many,” she added. According to the latest snapshot from IHS Markit/Cips, UK-based firms suffered from rising costs for freight, shipping and air transportation amid supply chain disruption. However, firms also recorded further growth of production, new orders and employment at the end of 2021. Hiring increased for the 12th successive month in a row in December, as firms battled to meet improved demand, rising backlogs of work and efforts to address staff shortages. The IHS Markit/Cips manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) rose to 57.9 in December, little changed from a three-month high of 58.1 in November. A mark above 50 signifies growth as opposed to contraction.
Inflationary pressures remained high, and companies reported a sharp increase in costs for chemicals, electronics, energy, food products, metals, timber and wood. Although firms were optimistic that disruption linked to Covid and Brexit should gradually fade over the course of 2022, experts warned headwinds for UK factory output and exports remained. Dave Atkinson, a regional director at Lloyds Bank, said: “There are tentative signs as the pace of output growth builds that some supply chain pressures, which have dragged on the sector for months, are starting to ease. But manufacturers expect supply headaches to persist throughout 2022, with chip shortages in particular likely to be prevalent even into next year.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/brexit-covid-exports-uk-factories-economy-manufacturing;2
422;422;5669;5669;Elizabeth Holmes guilty on four fraud counts | First Thing;2022-01-04T11:28:00Z;['Nicola Slawson'];['Elizabeth Holmes'];"Good morning. The extraordinary rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, has been sealed as jurors found her guilty on four of 11 charges of fraud, concluding a high-profile trial that captivated Silicon Valley and chronicled the missteps of the now defunct blood testing startup. The jury found Holmes guilty of several charges – including conspiracy to defraud investors – after a dramatic day in which jurors said they remained deadlocked on three of the criminal counts she faced. Yesterday, the seventh day of deliberations, the jury told US district judge Edward Davila that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on those three charges. In response, Davila encouraged them to deliberate further, but jurors later returned and rendered their final decision. Was she found guilty of all charges? No. She was acquitted on three charges, including one conspiracy to defraud patients and two charges related to patients who received inaccurate test results. How did Holmes react? As the verdict was read, the Theranos founder bowed her head, remained seated and expressed no visible emotion. Will she go to prison? Holmes does face prison time, although a sentencing date has not been set. She pleaded not guilty and is expected to appeal. Capitol attack panel in race against time as Trump allies seek to run out clock
The House select committee investigating the 6 January attack on the Capitol is facing a race against time in 2022 as Trump and his allies seek to run out the clock with a barrage of delay tactics and lawsuits. Republicans are widely expected to do well in this year’s midterm elections in November and, if they win control of the House, that would give them control to shut down the investigation that has proved politically and legally damaging to Trump and Republicans. The select committee opened its investigative efforts into the 6 January insurrection, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election win, with a flurry of subpoenas to Trump officials to expedite the evidence-gathering process. But aside from securing a trove of documents from Trump’s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, the select committee has found itself wading through molasses with Trump and other top administration aides seeking to delay the investigation by any means possible. What will happen next? Trump has launched a last-ditch appeal to the supreme court to prevent the release of the most sensitive of White House records but experts say it’s unlikely to be successful. Will the 6 January attackers be held accountable? As Republicans spread a revisionist history of the insurrection, the Guardian takes a look inside the FBI’s Capitol riot investigation. Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre’s legal deal with Jeffrey Epstein released
Court papers unsealed on Monday revealed that Virginia Giuffre received $500,000 in a legal settlement with Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender whom she accused of sexual abuse. The unsealing stemmed from Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against Prince Andrew, which she filed on 9 August in Manhattan federal court. Giuffre has long accused Epstein and his sometime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell – now a convicted sex trafficker, after her New York trial – of forcing her into sex with the royal when she was 17. He vehemently maintains his innocence. Andrew filed Giuffre’s settlement with Epstein as part of his attempt to dismiss her case, arguing that it shields him. Lawyers for the prince contend the settlement contains provisions that bar Giuffre from taking legal action against many Epstein associates. What does the unsealed settlement say? It says that upon receipt of the stipulated sum, Giuffre, referred to under her maiden name, agrees to “remise, release, acquit, satisfy and forever discharge the said second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant … from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia Roberts, including state or federal, cause and causes of action”.

A total of 1.06 million people tested positive for the virus, a figure driven largely by the Omicron variant, data from Johns Hopkins University revealed. Monday’s number is almost double the previous record of about 590,000 set four days ago, which itself was a doubling from the previous week.

Don’t miss this: the next US civil war is already here – we just refuse to see it
The US today is, once again, headed for civil war, and, like in the past, it cannot bear to face it. The political problems are both structural and immediate, the crisis both longstanding and accelerating. The American political system has become so overwhelmed by anger that even the most basic tasks of government are increasingly impossible. The right has recognized that the system is in collapse, and it has a plan: violence and solidarity with treasonous far-right factions. … or this: ‘I saw a big set of white teeth coming towards me’
How does it feel to fight off a predator in the wild? From a British citizen attacked by otters in Singapore, to monkey attacks in Thailand, squirrel attacks in New York, and a man who fought off a crocodile with a pocketknife in Queensland, these encounters capture our imaginations. But how does it feel to survive such an ordeal – and how does it affect your life? Five people, who lived to tell the tale, explain. Climate check: deforestation jumps in world’s largest savanna as scientists raise alarm
Deforestation last year rose to the highest level since 2015 in Brazil’s Cerrado, prompting scientists to raise alarm over the state of the world’s most species-rich savanna and a major carbon sink that helps to stave off climate change. The Cerrado, the world’s largest savanna spread across several states of Brazil, is often called an “upside down forest” because of the deep roots its plants sink into the ground to survive seasonal droughts and fires. “It’s extremely worrying,” said Mercedes Bustamante, an ecologist at the University of Brasília. Last Thing: NHL fan saves life of Canucks staffer after spotting cancerous mole
When Nadia Popovici spotted a small mole on the back of Brian Hamilton’s neck last October, during an NHL game between the Vancouver Canucks and the Seattle Kraken, she was unsure if the Canucks’ assistant equipment manager was aware it was there. Gaining Hamilton’s attention, she wrote a message on her phone and pressed it against the plexiglass dividing the crowd from the ice. “The mole on the back of your neck is possibly cancerous,” the fan wrote. “Please go see a doctor!” Popovici was right and Hamilton is now cancer-free.

423;423;5670;5670;The US military is polluting Hawaii’s water supply – and denying it | Wayne Tanaka;2022-01-04T11:17:10Z;['N/A'];['Environment', 'Pollution', 'Hawaii'];"“This [fuel facility] is not the eighth wonder of the world. It is Frankenstein’s monster. And we have to kill it before it kills us.” This is the plea from Marti Townsend, one of more than 1,000 Hawai’i residents urging the Honolulu City Council to take action to protect our island’s most important resource: fresh, clean water. Frankenstein’s monster is the US Navy’s Red Hill Fuel Storage Facility: a massive underground “farm” of 18-million liter fuel tanks and pipes just 100 feet above metropolitan O’ahu. Its construction began before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Since then, it has leaked over 180,000 gallons of petroleum into the groundwater aquifer that provides drinking water for over 400,000 residents and visitors from Hālawa to Hawaiʻi Kai. Despite its longstanding threat to water systems, this decrepit facility has been in use until operations were “paused” in late November, after hundreds of military families reported rashes, headaches, nausea, vomiting – symptoms of petroleum poisoning. The Navy denied these facts for days. “We have no immediate indication that the water is unsafe to drink,” their representatives said, even after the Navy had quietly shut down its own drinking water well. Pearl Harbor’s commander even told our community – of sick families, pregnant women and nursing moms – that “my staff and I are drinking the water on base.” Hawai‘i’s Health Department finally stepped in, advising Navy water system users not to drink their tap water. Navy officials still refuse to acknowledge that this is a crisis. It views the Governor’s emergency order to de-fuel the Red Hill Facility as a mere “request,” and has enlisted top Navy lawyers to make sure its 600m liters of petroleum stay perched above our water supply. A military spouse in our legal proceedings this week sobbed as she described the family dog rejecting its water dish for days. Another mother teared up as she remembered her infant child vomiting constantly after the Navy advised that her water was safe (it wasn’t); their own beloved and once-healthy dog had to be put down, after thousands of dollars could not diagnose its sudden debilitating illness. The Navy’s Assistant Secretary, in his subsequent remote testimony from the nation’s capital, even had the gall to complain that he had missed that night’s weekly American football game. The injustice of the Red Hill tragedy reflects the impunity of the US military – not only in its endless wars in the Middle East, but right here in Hawai’i. A fraction of the US’s $768bn defense budget could help boost our ailing and inequitable healthcare system, provide free college for all, or make the investments needed to halve our carbon emissions and help keep entire countries from heartbreaking devastation. Yet every year our politicians pour ever more taxpayer dollars into the planet’s most expensive, and deadly, machine. Not even Hawai‘i’s federal delegation has been to stand up to this mighty power. Their long-due request to the US federal government has been milquetoast: we need more studies, and we need to fix some pipes. Only Representative Kai Kahele, the only Hawai‘i delegate with military experience, has acknowledged that the facility must be defueled. The US commander-in-chief, President Joe Biden, has yet to even acknowledge the situation. Frankenstein’s monster is not just the facility: it is the larger US military machine. America’s elected leaders are unable and unwilling to rein in this monster that consumes ever more of the country’s resources as it poisons our atmosphere and now, our island’s water. These leaders dare to call themselves representatives of the people while allegedly lying under oath, letting military families be poisoned, and sacrificing entire islands of US citizens. While America’s Frankenstein may consume its creator, the people of Hawai‘i will resist it. We think about the ones we love, our children and grandchildren, and what we would do to protect them from harm. Our weapons are not guns and ships but words, signs, songs, and aloha ʻāina, love for our home, for each other. Native Hawaiians, whose ancestors have always understood the importance of wai, of water, who have fought and died and won against the US Navy before, are now leading the fight to fix a mess they had no hand in making. “History will remember the people that stood up,” Dr Kamanamaikalani Beamer recently told a crowd of several hundred at the steps of Hawai‘i’s capitol, by the statue of Hawai‘i’s last queen, herself unlawfully deposed by the US Navy. “We will regain control and authority over our resources to do what is pono (just) because we must preserve them for the generations to come. There are more battles on this issue. We’re not making suggestions to the military. We are making demands.” Wayna Tanaka is Director for the Sierra Club of Hawai’i";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/the-us-military-is-polluting-hawaiis-water-supply-and-denying-it;3
424;424;5671;5671;Our new year’s resolution for 2022: to rise up and fight back | Bernie Sanders;2022-01-04T11:17:10Z;['Bernie Sanders'];['US income inequality', 'US news', 'Bernie Sanders', 'US unions'];"As we begin the year 2022, in these unprecedented times, I know it’s easy to give in to despair. We are facing a raging pandemic with seemingly no end in sight. We are rapidly moving toward oligarchy and while income and wealth inequality grows, millions struggle to obtain the basic necessities of life. We have a dysfunctional healthcare system with more than 84 million uninsured or underinsured and nearly one out of four unable to afford prescription drugs. Climate change is ravaging the planet and systemic racism and other forms of bigotry continue to eat away at the fabric of our society. We have a corrupt political system in which corporate money buys elections and a mainstream media that largely ignores the pain that ordinary people experience. And, in the midst of all this, Republicans across the country are working overtime trying to undermine democracy by making it harder for people of color, young people and those who oppose them to vote in our next elections. In other words, the challenges we face are enormous and it is easy to understand why many may fall into depression and cynicism. This is a state of mind, however, that we must resist – not only for ourselves but for our kids and future generations. The stakes are just too high. Despair is not an option. We must stand up and fight back.
And here is some very good news. While the corporate-owned media may not be actively reporting it, working people all over the country, with extraordinary courage and determination, are taking on corporate greed, and they are winning. Workers at John Deere waged their first strike in more than three decades, stayed on the picket lines and eventually won a contract with strong wage increases, a ratification bonus and improved health insurance. Striking nurses in Buffalo won raises that moved all workers to at least $15 an hour and a reduction in staff shortages. These nurses fought not only for themselves, but their patients – and they won. Kaiser Permanente healthcare workers won a major victory after rejecting a contract that would have given new workers lower wages and benefits. Nabisco workers, struggling against forced overtime, inadequate wages and pensions, a two-tier health system and the outsourcing of jobs, went on strike and won. Once again we saw workers fighting not just for themselves, but for the next generation of workers.
More than 1,400 Kellogg’s workers in Michigan, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Nebraska went on strike for months and won, fighting back against a plan to give new workers lower wages and benefits. Starbucks employees in upstate New York, for the very first time, organized a union shop in a fight against a giant corporation that did just about everything it could to stop them. Those are just some of the inspiring efforts that took place last year. Let me tell you about what’s happening right now as workers continue to stand up to some of the most powerful corporate interests in the country. In Huntington, West Virginia, 450 steelworkers at the Special Metals company have been engaged in a major strike for almost 100 days. Special Metals is a profitable company owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett, of course, is one of the richest people in the world, with wealth of over $109bn. While Special Metals made $1.5bn in profits last year and Mr Buffett became over $40bn richer during the pandemic, executives at this company offered workers an outrageous and insulting contract that includes a zero pay increase for this year, and a totally unacceptable 1% pay raise next year, while quadrupling healthcare premiums and reducing vacation time.
Sadly, the corporate greed that is going on in West Virginia is not an aberration. In Santa Fe Springs, California, about 100 bakery workers, who make cakes for Baskin Robbins, Safeway and Cold Stone Creamery, are on strike against the appropriately named Rich Products Corporation at the Jon Donaire Desserts production plant. About 75% of these employees are Latina women who are often forced into mandatory overtime with little to no notice and sometimes work up to 16 hours a day. This is a company that made $4bn in revenue last year. During the pandemic, Bob Rich, the majority owner of Rich Products, increased his wealth by more than $2bn. While the workers he employs barely make more than California’s minimum wage, Mr Rich currently has a net worth of more than $7.5bn. Yet, despite his billions in wealth, the “best and final offer” Mr Rich has put on the table for his workers is an insulting $1-an-hour wage increase. That is pathetic. But it’s also not unusual in the world of corporate greed. In Brookwood, Alabama, about 1,100 workers at Warrior Met Coal have been on strike since April. Just like the bakery workers in California and the steelworkers in West Virginia, these are workers who also have worked as many as seven days a week and up to 16 hours per day.
In 2016, under great pressure to keep the company afloat and keep jobs in their community, these coalminers agreed to a $6-an-hour pay cut – more than 20% of their average salary – and a substantial reduction in their healthcare and retirement benefits as part of a restructuring deal made by Wall Street vulture funds like Blackstone and Apollo. Meanwhile, the executives at Warrior Met and their Wall Street investors made out like bandits. Since 2017, Warrior Met has rewarded $1.4bn in dividends to its wealthy shareholders while handing out bonuses of up to $35,000 to its executives. Yet, while the company has returned to profitability, Warrior Met has offered its workers a measly $1.50 raise over 5 years and has refused to restore the healthcare and pension benefits that were taken away. The struggles that these workers are experiencing are not unique. There are millions of other Americans in exactly the same position – people who have to fight tooth-and-nail against wealthy and powerful corporate interests for decent wages, healthcare, pensions and safe working conditions. And let’s be clear. Class warfare in this country is intensifying. Greed is on the rise.
What history has always taught us is that real change never takes place from the top on down. It is always occurs from the bottom on up. That is the history of the labor movement, the civil rights movement, the women’s movement, the environmental movement and the gay rights movement. That is the history of every effort that has brought about transformational change in our society. And that is the struggle we must intensify today. At a time when the demagogues want to divide us up based on the color of our skin, where we were born, our religion or our sexual orientation, we must do exactly the opposite. We must bring people together around a progressive agenda. We must educate, organize and build an unstoppable grassroots movement that helps create the kind of nation we know we can become. One that is based on the principles of justice and compassion, not greed and oligarchy. The greatest weapon our opponents have is not just their unlimited wealth and power. It is their ability to create a culture that makes us feel weak and hopeless and diminishes the strength of human solidarity. And here is our new year’s resolution. Like the thousands of workers who stood up and fought courageously in 2021, we will do the same. No one individual is going to save us. We must rise up together. Happy new year.

425;425;5672;5672;Dam it: beavers head north to the Arctic as tundra continues to heat up;2022-01-04T11:00:10Z;['Oliver Milman'];['Animals', 'Arctic', 'Alaska', 'Environment', 'US news', 'World news'];"The transformation of the rapidly warming Arctic is being accelerated by a wave of thousands of newcomers that are waddling and paddling northwards: beavers. Scientists who sought to map the spread of beavers in Alaska were astounded to find that the creatures have pushed far north into previously inhospitable territory and are now set to sweep into the furthest northern extremities as the Arctic tundra continues to heat up due to the climate crisis.
“We didn’t know what we would find and ended up being very surprised,” said Ken Tape, an ecologist at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, who co-authored the new research. “There are areas of Alaska that had no evidence of beavers 50 years ago that are now apparently saturated with them,” he said, adding: “It’s just a matter of time before they head even further north. When you consider this is likely happening across the rest of the Arctic in Canada and Russia, that gives you an idea of the scope of this change.” Using aerial photographs and satellite imagery reaching back to 1949, and observations recorded from before then, an international team of researchers involved in the Arctic Beaver Observation Network identified more than 12,000 ponds created by beavers damming rivers and streams across western Alaska. This number has doubled in the past 20 years. In recent years, as the Arctic has heated up three times quicker than the global average, the North American beaver has ventured north and west and now occupies vast swaths of the Seward peninsula, a large landmass that extends from the western coast of Alaska. The impact of these portly semiaquatic rodents has been felt by the remote Indigenous communities of Alaska, with the flooded areas created by beavers causing concern over access to food and travel. It’s unknown how many beavers are now in the northern and western parts of Alaska, with estimates ranging from 50,000 to close to 100,000. “The true impact of the spread of beavers into the Arctic on the environment and the Indigenous communities who live there is not yet fully known,” said Helen Wheeler, a researcher at Anglia Ruskin University. “However, we do know that people are concerned about the impact beaver dams are having on water quality, the numbers of fish downstream of the dams, and access for their boats.” A broader consequence of the arrival of beavers could be the acceleration of the climate change which, in combination with a reduction in fur trapping over the past century, has probably allowed the beavers to push north. Beavers, which do not hibernate, have benefited from shortening winters and the wider availability of vegetation available to feed upon. The pools that accumulate when beavers dam rivers create localized unfrozen “hotpots” that result in the thawing of permafrost, the always-frozen ground of the Arctic that holds vast amounts of carbon. Scientists warn that a widespread thawing of permafrost could cause global heating to spiral dangerously out of control. “Those ponds absorb heat better, they change the hydrology of the area and the permafrost responds to that,” said Tape. “Beavers are coming in from the outside, imposing themselves on the ecosystem and disrupting it. “It’s accelerating the effects of climate change. When you realize what’s happened in western Alaska is likely to happen to northern Alaska, it does give you pause.” Tape said that the Brooks Range, a mountain range that runs across northern Alaska, will be an obstacle to the beavers but will not stop them as they follow rivers up to the north coast. Further research is under way.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/beavers-arctic-north-climate-crisis;3
426;426;5673;5673;Ohio student sues coaches for allegedly forcing him to eat pizza against religion;2022-01-04T11:00:10Z;['Maya Yang'];['Ohio', 'US education', 'Law (US)', 'Religion', 'US news'];"An Ohio high school student has filed a lawsuit against his former school and sports coaches after they forced him to eat a pepperoni pizza against his religion. The 17-year old student, known in court documents as KW or Junior, argues that his former coaches, who knew that he was a member of the Hebrew-Israelite faith and did not consume pork products, forced him to eat a whole pepperoni pizza as a consequence of missing a workout last May. According to the complaint filed last week, coaches at the Canton McKinley high school in Stark county, Ohio, forced Junior to eat the pizza in the middle of a gymnasium after he was unable to attend a weight-lifting session due to a shoulder injury. Junior asserts that at the time of the incident, he had been a member of the football team for two and a half years and that coaches were aware of his dietary restrictions. Junior “reminded defendants’ employees that he does not eat pork, due to his religious beliefs … In fact, Junior kicked the pizza box away from him, refusing to touch the pork pepperoni pizza … Defendants’ employees retrieved the pizza box and again ordered Junior to eat the pork pepperoni pizza,” the complaint said. It added: “Junior stated a minimum of 10 times that he did not eat pork or pork residue … At this point, defendants’ employees then stated that Junior could remove the pork pepperoni slices; however, the residue was clearly still covering the pizza and Junior continued to object.” When his coaches then threatened to remove him from the team, Junior ate the pizza with the pepperoni residue. The federal civil rights lawsuit alleges that the coaches’ “antisemitic and shameful” behavior caused Junior to suffer “substantial permanent injury”. It also argues that the coaches violated Junior’s first and 14th amendment constitutional rights by infringing his right to exercise freedom of religion and denying him due process and equal protection. As a result, Junior and his parents are seeking over $12m in damages from the school district and coaching staff. He has since transferred to another school and football program. Seven coaches were fired in June after the incident. Peter Pattakos, an attorney for most of the former coaches, argued that his clients are the “real victims in this matter”, were wrongly terminated and have sued for defamation.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/ohio-student-pepperoni-pizza-lawsuit-former-coaches;2
427;427;5674;5674;Grenfell inquiry: ex-ministers and serving secretary of state to be cross-examined;2022-01-04T11:00:10Z;['Robert Booth'];['Grenfell Tower inquiry', 'Grenfell Tower fire', 'UK news', 'Eric Pickles', 'Conservatives', 'Firefighters', 'Politics', 'London', 'Michael Gove', 'David Cameron', 'Housing', 'Communities', 'Society'];Four former ministers and a serving secretary of state will be cross-examined this year in a potentially politically explosive climax to the four-year Grenfell Tower public inquiry. Eric Pickles, the former secretary of state for communities, Brandon Lewis, the current Northern Ireland secretary, and the former housing minister Gavin Barwell will face hours of questioning over claims Conservative-led governments prioritised a “bonfire of red tape” over safety. Senior politicians are likely to be interviewed on how they responded to direct warnings about safety in high-rise blocks from the commissioner of the London fire brigade just weeks before the disaster. James Wharton, a former junior minister and close ally of Boris Johnson, and Stephen Williams, a former Liberal Democrat junior minister, are also expected to give evidence in person. Over three months, the inquiry will turn the spotlight from the actions of combustible materials manufacturers and the consultants and builders involved in the council block’s disastrous refurbishment, to the government that pursued – lawyers for the bereaved claim – “a political ideology which broke free from common sense and safety constraints”. Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, has already admitted the government “failed people at Grenfell” and told MPs that “on a couple of occasions” it had “not necessarily appreciated the importance of fire safety and not necessarily done everything in the wake of the Lakanal House tragedy [a 2009 tower block fire where six people died] that it should have done.” While the inquiry will look at the actions of governments going back to the 1990s, a principal context will be what David Cameron described in 2012 as his government’s “resolution to kill off the health and safety culture for good”. The bereaved have called for Cameron to give evidence to explain his policy, but the inquiry has not asked him to do so and Lord Pickles will field important questions Pickles was Cameron’s cabinet minister in charge of building safety from 2010 to 2015, and will be asked why the government failed to overhaul fire regulation guidance despite an instruction to do so by the coroner on the Lakanal House fire. The ambiguity of the guidance, which remained in place at the time of the Grenfell disaster on 14 June 2017, was a significant factor in allowing companies and consultants to use combustible materials, the inquiry has heard. In one letter disclosed to the inquiry, Pickles is shown assuring the coroner there would be a “future review” but arguing “fire protection in buildings is a complex subject and should remain, to some extent, in the realm of professionals”. Lawyers for the bereaved have argued the government became the “junior partner” in a relationship with the housebuilding industry, which allowed companies too much control over standards. In 2011 Pickles launched the “red tape challenge” to slash bureaucracy facing business. In the budget that year a new rule was introduced that required a waiver for any change to the building regulations. The inquiry will examine internal Whitehall documents showing how in 2015, a civil service briefing for the then housing minister Lord Wharton, was explicit that the review had been postponed “whilst the department focused its attention on other priorities including the red tape challenge”. Only “lip service” was paid to the commitment to the coroner to review the regulations, Anne Studd QC, counsel for the mayor of London has argued. Pickles has so far told the inquiry in a statement he does not recall “the potential industry use of combustible materials in external cladding systems was ever raised with me”. Pickles is also likely to be questioned on his resistance to introducing sprinklers as a safety measure, which the Fire Brigades Union has told the inquiry would have saved lives at Grenfell. In October 2013, when the Welsh government made sprinklers mandatory for new-build homes, Pickles complained it had “hit the housing market with extra red tape, adding £13,000 to the cost of building a new home”. In fact, a government briefing note disclosed to the inquiry said the amount was no more than £3,000. The inquiry may ask where he got his numbers from. In February 2014, Lewis, a junior minister under Pickles at the time, told parliament that “sprinklers work” but referred to a “one in two out” rule as part of the coalition’s red tape policy and said: “In that context … we want to exhaust all non-regulatory options before we introduce any new regulations.” Ministers are also likely to be asked about their dealings with Sir David Amess, the Tory backbencher who was killed in October. In 2014 Amess chaired the all-party parliamentary fire safety and rescue group, which was pressing Willams, the housing minister, to get on with the building regulations review ordered after Lakanal. Penny Mordaunt, an undersecretary in the department at the time, told Amess that Williams had seen no evidence it was urgent, and that he “was not willing to disrupt the work of the department” by getting on with it. This was “chilling”, the inquiry has heard. Amess’s group replied that it was “at a loss to understand” how independent evidence “which had life safety implications” was not urgent. It said: “Should a major fire tragedy with loss of life occur between now and 2017 … where the matters which had been raised here were found to be contributory to the outcome, then the group would be bound to bring this to others’ attention.” Lord Barwell, Theresa May’s former chief of staff who held the office of housing minister in the year before the disaster, is likely to face questioning over how he handled direct fire safety warnings from the London fire commissioner, Dany Cotton. On 3 April 2017 Cotton told Barwell and Lewis, by that time policing and fire minister, of “mounting evidence of issues of concern within residential buildings and, in particular, blocks of flats” about compartmentation and the impact on the policy of telling people to stay put in the event of a blaze. She said: “We are also concerned about contractor competency, and how this influences compartmentation deficiencies and therefore occupants’ safety.” This was prescient as the compartmentation failed catastrophically at Grenfell, partly because of poor workmanship, and the stay-put policy was kept in place for too long, costing lives, the inquiry has already found. A significant civil servant facing questioning will be Brian Martin, a former building control officer who rose to be a senior adviser to ministers on building regulations. He is likely to be asked what he knew about companies bringing dangerous, non-compliant materials to the market by exploiting confusions in how the building regulations could be met. Michael Mansfield QC, representing some of the bereaved, has alleged Martin “took an attitude that was complacent and collusive with a dangerously out-of-control industry”. In July 2014 Martin emailed a contact at the National House Building Council, which provided building control and warranty services for new-build homes, saying that “reliable sources” had been telling him that combustible foam insulation was being used in cladding on high-rise flats. He referred to polyisocyanurate foam, the kind specified for Grenfell that fuelled the fire and released toxic gas, but all he said was: “The purpose of my email is a friendly warning. You might want to double-check with your inspectors [ … ] that they are on top of this”.

428;428;5675;5675;Will the hundreds of Capitol rioters in court ever be held truly accountable?;2022-01-04T11:00:10Z;['Nick Robins-Early'];['US Capitol attack', 'Republicans', 'US news', 'US politics'];"It’s been one year since a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol, as the “stop the steal” rally demanding to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election turned into a deadly insurrection. After the attack, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation mobilized one of the largest criminal investigations in American history. Those efforts have so far resulted in more than 700 federal cases and counting, with more suspects expected to be charged. But for all that we have learned about the insurrection and the people who took part in it, crucial questions remain about the fallout of the attack for the far right and what it means to hold its perpetrators accountable. Federal prosecutors want the arrests and convictions of those responsible to act as a deterrent against extremism and future attempts to undermine democracy, experts say, but despite more than 150 guilty pleas so far, the legacy of 6 January is already contentious. A judicial debate has emerged over the appropriate sentencing for rioters, while trials in the coming months will test whether prosecutors can secure convictions on more serious charges facing far-right extremists.
The fundamental understanding of what happened on 6 January is also being increasingly contested, as Republican lawmakers and rightwing media attempt to whitewash the events and reframe the insurrection as an act of justified political protest. More than any court case, researchers say, this revisionist narrative may have long-lasting implications for the far right and for political violence in America. The suspects In the months after the insurrection, law enforcement officials investigated hours upon hours of videos from the day, thousands of social media profiles and hundreds of thousands of tips from the public. They have arrested hundreds, sometimes raiding homes where suspects had stockpiled weapons and ammunition. As the arrests rolled in, researchers began to get a more complete picture of who was involved in the attack. The people charged came to Washington DC from nearly every state in the union, and ranged from teenagers to senior citizens. Beyond sharing a fervent support for Trump and belief in election conspiracies, no single profile has emerged. Overall the suspects are overwhelmingly male – about 80% according to research from George Washington University’s project on extremism – and the average age is 39. The vast majority of suspects are white. Many belonged to far-right militias and white nationalist groups that played an outsize role in the attack, but most had no direct affiliations with extremist organizations. “They’re sort of your nextdoor neighbor,” said Kurt Braddock, an assistant professor of communication at American University and extremism researcher. “It shows how far far-right ideologies have extended.” There were white-collar workers, people who came with their family members and a cross-section of other Trump supporters radicalized into committing political violence. Many believed in the QAnon conspiracy movement that viewed Trump as a messianic figure who would return to office and destroy a cabal of liberal elite pedophiles. The charges and sentencing Although the charges range from misdemeanors such as trespassing to violent assaults against Capitol police officers, the bulk of cases that have come in front of a judge so far have involved individuals pleading guilty to minor charges. Except for some high-profile rioters – including “QAnon shaman” Jacob Chansley, who was sentenced to 41 months in prison after pleading guilty to a felony charge of obstructing Congress – most of the sentences doled out have not exceeded several weeks in prison. Many of the rioters have received no jail time at all, instead receiving fines or probation. There have been significant differences between how US district court judges have approached sentencing and cases. One group of judges has questioned why prosecutors are seeking jail time for misdemeanor offences such as trespassing on Capitol grounds. US District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, made comparisons between Black Lives Matter protesters and the 6 January attackers and told a defendant that he was “acting like all those looters and rioters last year”.(McFadden did, however, later reject a defendant’s claim that he was being treated unfairly compared with leftist protesters in Portland.) Other judges have vehemently rejected the comparison to BLM, and have insisted that participants in the riot face serious consequences for their involvement. US District Judge Tanya Chutkan stated that the siege was an unprecedented attempt to “violently overthrow the government” and “stop the peaceful transition of power”. Chief US District Judge Beryl Howell questioned why prosecutors were letting rioters accept lighter misdemeanor plea deals and lamented that “the government has essentially tied the sentencing judge’s hands”. “No wonder parts of this public are confused about whether what happened on 6 January at the Capitol was simply a petty offense of trespassing, with some disorderliness, or was shocking criminal conduct that posed a grave threat to our democratic norms,” Howell said. The more complex cases and serious charges will probably go to trial in the coming months, researchers say, including those involving members of the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters and other far-right militias. One member of the Oath Keepers, Jason Dolan, already admitted as part of a plea deal that he traveled with other militia members and stashed an M4 rifle at a Comfort Inn a short drive outside the Capitol. In December, 34-year-old Matthew Greene became the first member of the Proud Boys to plead guilty in a felony conspiracy case, with prosecutors stating that he and other Proud Boys coordinated their actions using programmable radios and dressed to conceal their affiliation with the group. After the riot, Greene allegedly ordered more than 2,000 rounds of assault-rifle ammunition, bragged that his group “took the Capitol” and told a friend to study guerrilla warfare and be ready to “do uncomfortable things”.
The criminal trials this spring for felony charges such as obstructing Congress and a multi-defendant conspiracy case against members of the Oath Keepers may reveal new details about the level of coordination and planning that went into the attack on the Capitol. But they will probably also present difficulties for prosecutors. The government has already succeeded in dismissing some pre-trial defense objections, such as whether the common charge of “corruptly obstructing an official proceeding” was unconstitutionally vague, but more challenges will come. “It’s going to get complicated very quickly,” said Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the program on extremism at George Washington University. “You’re going to get into uncharted water with this prosecution at some point, just by the sheer number.” The investigation The FBI received more than 250,000 tips related to the siege, including family members turning in relatives and Facebook friends reporting old high school acquaintances. One suspect, New York state’s Robert Chapman, told a match on the dating app Bumble that he had stormed the Capitol and bragged about making it all the way to the National Statuary Hall. “We are not a match,” the other Bumble user replied, according to court filings, before sending a screenshot of their exchange to law enforcement. More than 80% of cases cite some form of social media as evidence for the charges, but the FBI’s investigation goes far beyond relying on amateur online sleuths and combing through social media profiles. Law enforcement has also used invasive technology and surveillance tactics that could expand law enforcement powers and have implications for future investigations. In addition to using facial recognition software to identify rioters, itself a deeply controversial practice, law enforcement appears to have expanded its use of geofencing search warrants – a process that involves using data from digital services to locate people within a certain area during a given time period. In practice, it means that authorities can demand Google hand over anonymized user location data, then ask for specific users’ private information, including their names, emails and phone numbers. Dozens of Capitol rioter cases cite Google location data in their court filings, according to a Wired investigation. “It’s going to set a precedent for geofencing,” Hughes said. “If they can get enough successful prosecutions … that will be something that’s used in future investigations.” The FBI’s use of surveillance has come under additional scrutiny in recent weeks after a New York Times investigation found that the bureau deployed surveillance teams to monitor Portland activists’ protests against policing, a move that civil rights groups condemned as domestic spying. Whitewashing the attack As the FBI has carried out its investigation, there has been a parallel effort to create a different narrative of the insurrection. Republican politicians and conservative media have been on a months-long campaign to whitewash the attack on the Capitol. Over the past year they have settled on a story that presents 6 January as a largely peaceful protest for legitimate election grievances, sometimes baselessly claiming that any violence was the result of antifa or leftist infiltrators. Prime-time Fox News host Tucker Carlson in November aired a three episode special entitled Patriot Purge that uncritically interviewed rightwing activists with ties to the white nationalist movement, who claim that the FBI investigation is an unjust political crackdown on conservatives. Carlson states in it that there is a leftist “purge aimed at legacy Americans” and features sympathetic interviews with people who took part in the insurrection. Two Fox News contributors quit over the special, with one suggesting that it would lead to violence. Many of the rioters have embraced a burgeoning celebrity status within the far right. Some suspects refer to themselves as “1/6ers”, and have launched online fundraising campaigns where they identify as political protesters and victims of government persecution. One collective fundraising page for the approximately 40 suspects being held in pre-trial detention has already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and sells hoodies emblazoned with the slogan “free the 1/6ers.” Other high-profile suspects have created individual pages to capitalize on their notoriety. Richard “Bigo” Barnett, a self-described white nationalist who stole a document from speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi’s office and was photographed putting his boots up on her desk, launched a fundraising site that doubles as a manifesto for his anti-government views.
“Richard Barnett’s picture at Speaker Pelosi’s desk has become the face of the new anti-federalist movement,” Barnett’s website states on its fundraising page. “We will not go gently into that good night. Click below to donate to the fight.” The group being held in pre-trial detention at the Correctional Treatment facility in Washington DC has also banded together while incarcerated, calling themselves the “Patriot Wing” and attempting to become far-right influencers. These suspects include numerous members of extremist groups such as the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, as well as others facing more serious charges of violence and conspiracy related to the insurrection. They have started writing open letters and reportedly passed around a handwritten newsletter in the jail, in which they boast about reciting the pledge of allegiance and singing the national anthem together. Some Republican lawmakers have amplified this far-right narrative that the suspects being held in pre-trial detention are political prisoners and unjustly suffering for their beliefs. Representatives including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Paul Gosar, Matt Gaetz and Louie Gohmert have rallied in support of insurrection suspects and staged an attempt to visit the jail, claiming a conspiracy to mistreat the prisoners and that their detention was evidence of Marxism and totalitarianism. Meanwhile, more mainstream Republican lawmakers have stonewalled a House committee investigation into the roots of the attack, and Trump allies have refused to cooperate with subpoenas.
All these developments – the solidifying of in-group identity among the more dedicated insurrections, the financial support for rioters and Republican lawmakers’ willingness to paint them as martyrs – concerns extremism researchers about the long-term effects of 6 January. Even if those responsible face significant prison sentences, there is little incentive for them to de-radicalize once incarcerated. “You may get to a point where folks who spend their time in jail come out and are basically provided a kind of a rockstar status within the movement,” Hughes said. The revisionist history of 6 January has also correlated with a declining interest among Republicans in punishing those involved. After the insurrection there was wide bipartisan support for prosecuting rioters, but a Pew Research Center study in September found the number of Republicans who believe it is important to hold those responsible legally liable for their actions significantly declined over the course of the year. Involvement in the events of 6 January is also apparently not disqualifying for Republicans seeking public office. At least 10 people who attended the Washington rally have now been elected to various positions, according to HuffPost, including three in state legislatures. What concerns some extremism researchers is that while it’s critical for prosecutors to secure convictions for those involved in the insurrection, these broader problems remain of how deeply embedded the far right has become in American politics. Even if authorities may be better prepared against future rallies aimed at subverting the democratic process, the reaction from rightwing media and some Republican lawmakers has threatened to legitimize far-right ideology and resorting to political violence to achieve their goals. “January 6 exemplified what the far right is now,” Braddock said. “But it definitely doesn’t end with January 6.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/will-capitol-rioters-be-held-accountable;2
429;429;5676;5676;Go-Ahead suspends shares amid Southeastern rail scandal;2022-01-04T10:52:34Z;['Mark Sweney'];['Go-Ahead', 'Travel & leisure', 'Business', 'Transport', 'UK news'];"Go-Ahead has halted the trading of its shares on the London Stock Exchange after the train and bus operator failed to file its financial results because of issues surrounding a £25m breach of Southeastern’s railway franchise agreement. The transport group, which was stripped of the contract to operate the commuter network in September, said it was continuing to work closely with its auditor Deloitte to attempt to publish its results for the year to 3 July by the end of the month. In December the company, which apologised for “serious” failings in its railway business after it was found not to have declared more than £25m in taxpayer funding that should have been returned, said the scandal meant it would miss the six-month deadline for filing its annual results and have to suspend its shares under UK regulatory rules. The announcement of the impending trading suspension prompted a 25% fall in the company’s share price, which ended the year at 667p, giving Go-Ahead a market value of £288m at the close of the last day the company’s shares traded on New Year’s Eve. Go-Ahead’s shares were officially suspended on Tuesday morning.
“The company intends to request a restoration of the listing of its ordinary shares and its bond on publication of the full year 2021 results,” said Go-Ahead in a filing to the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday. “The group continues to work closely with Deloitte to ensure that the full-year 2021 results are published as soon as possible. This is expected to be before the end of January.” The scandal, which cost Go-Ahead’s group chief financial officer, Elodie Brian, her job, will result in a fine from the Department for Transport. In December, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said that although the money had been recovered further investigations were being conducted into historical contact issues related to the franchise. The government has taken back control of the Southeastern franchise, which Go-Ahead operated through Govia, a joint venture with France’s Keolis. Go-Ahead still runs some of the busiest lines in the UK through Govia Thameslink Railways, another joint venture with Keolis.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/go-ahead-suspends-shares-amid-southeastern-rail-scandal;2
430;430;5677;5677;‘Quite incredible’: some of world’s rarest camellias discovered in Yorkshire;2022-01-04T10:50:20Z;['Mark Brown'];['Plants', 'Yorkshire', 'Heritage', 'UK news', 'The National Trust', 'North of England'];"Horticultural experts have compared it to finding a wondrous and unknown library of rare first editions, said the head gardener of Wentworth Woodhouse, Scott Jamieson, recalling the discovery of camellias believed to be some of the oldest and rarest in the western world. The important shrubs have been identified in a dilapidated glass and brick building on the estate of Wentworth Woodhouse, a spectacular Georgian palace near Rotherham in South Yorkshire, which is the subject of one of the UK’s biggest heritage restoration projects. The huge house and gardens are gradually revealing their secrets, one of the most eye-catching of which has been the discovery of the camellia house. “It is quite incredible,” said Jamieson, who has been at Wentworth Woodhouse for 17 years. “There are very few camellia houses left anywhere, certainly not one with a great collection of historic camellias.”
For many years the building, with jagged glass likely to fall at any point, was too dangerous to go into. That glass roof has been removed, allowing access to the 200-year-old camellias. The shrubs were imported for wealthy families in the 18th century on merchant ships belonging to the East India Company. The camellias were, wrongly, judged so precious and fragile that they needed to be pampered in a building with lots of light and a stove to heat the brick walls. There are 19 camellia shrubs in total, with the oldest believed to have arrived in 1792. That makes it older than any in the nationally important camellia collection at Chiswick House in London and a contender to be the oldest anywhere in the west. With the help of Chiswick House and others, three varieties have been identified and the detective work continues to find out more. It was about two years ago that Jamieson began trying to work out what the building was. He sent a plaintive callout to people who might know and a number of experts came in and were amazed. “They said it was almost like having a library of first editions … it’s that important in gardening history. So it’s wonderful.” The survival of the camellia house is all the more remarkable given it spent decades only feet away from an open cast mine, which began operating in the 1940s. It was a lunar-like landscape, said Jamieson, who has recently led a project restoring the original pathways to the gardens. “It would have been a strange environment, I imagine, you would have had a hacking cough and stinging eyes with that amount of pollution in the air. And it would have been noisy.” Two hundred years ago it would have been a very different story, with the ladies gathering in the camellia house to drink tea, gamble and smoke when the men were out hunting. The plan now is to develop the site into a specialist tea house and a community cafe. It is hoped it will open in 2022. Wentworth Woodhouse remains one of the nation’s most spectacular stately homes most people have never heard of.
To say that Wentworth Woodhouse is “over the top” is almost an understatement. It is twice as wide as Buckingham Palace, has 124,600 sq ft of living space, three acres of roofs, a room for every day of the year and is often described as Britain’s biggest house. The entire house would once have screamed opulence and excess, the walls lined with important paintings – notably George Stubbs’s Whistlejacket, now a star of the National Gallery. The volunteer guide Steve Ash says it hides in plain sight. “It’s lovely when you see young people come, because very often this is the first time they’ve been to a place like this. Then they realise it is on their doorstep. It is absolutely a proper hidden gem.” The property was in a terrible state when it was bought for £7m in 2016 by the Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust – established after a campaign by a local business owner, Julie Kenny. It is now the subject of a restoration project that could easily cost more than £250m. The house was given £4.6m of levelling up money by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in his October budget. That money will enable work to begin this year on the house’s vast stable block, a building so grand that some people assume it’s the main house.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/04/quite-incredible-some-of-worlds-rarest-camellias-discovered-in-yorkshire;3
431;431;5678;5678;Double defector who returned to North Korea ‘struggled financially’ in South;2022-01-04T10:36:24Z;['Justin McCurry'];['North Korea', 'South Korea', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news'];A North Korean defector who made a daring return to his home country at the weekend had reportedly struggled to build a new life in South Korea since his arrival just over a year ago. The man, who has not been named, crossed the heavily armed demilitarised zone [DMZ] that has divided North and South since the end of the 1950 to 1953 Korean war, on Saturday. Reports said the defector, who is in his 30s, had been prompted to make the dangerous journey back across the border after struggling to make ends meet in the South. His decision to return to North Korea has raised questions about how defectors are treated in the South, where many face discrimination in employment, education and housing. The North has not publicly commented on the man – one of about 30 double-defectors who have returned to their home country from the South in the past decade – but has acknowledged receipt of messages from the South Korean military about his escape, the Yonhap news agency said. A South Korean military official confirmed that the man, who had worked as a cleaner, appeared to have been experiencing financial difficulties. “I would say he was classified as lower class, barely scraping a living,” the official said. Officials said they had no reason to believe the man had been spying for the North and have launched an inquiry into how he was able to negotiate a barbed wire fence running along the 248km (155-mile)-long border, which is dotted with landmines and patrolled by troops around the clock, despite being caught on surveillance cameras hours earlier. After fleeing North Korea in November 2020, the man identified himself as a former gymnast and told investigators that he had crawled over barbed wire fences to reach the South, according to a defence ministry statement. An official at the South Korean unification ministry, which is responsible for cross-border affairs, said the man had received resettlement support from the government for his personal security, housing, medical treatment and employment since arriving in the South via the same eastern section of the DMZ. He had been spotted throwing away his belongings the day before he fled the South, Yonhap said. “He was taking out a mattress and bedding to rubbish dumps that morning, and it was strange because they were all too new,” a neighbour told Yonhap. “I thought about asking him to give it to us, but ended up not doing that, because we’ve never said hello to each other.” More than 33,000 North Koreans have defected to the South since the late 1990s – the vast majority via China and south-east Asia – to escape political persecution, food shortages and poverty. While some, such as the national assembly member Ji Seong-ho, go on to become highly successful in the wealthy, democratic South, many others struggle to find well-paid work. About 56% of defectors are categorised as being on low incomes, according to unification ministry data, and nearly 25% are in the lowest bracket – making them eligible for basic livelihood subsidies – six times the ratio of the general population. In a survey released last month by the Database Center For North Korean Human Rights and NK Social Research in Seoul, about 18% of 407 defectors polled said they were willing to return to the North, most of them citing nostalgia for the country they had left behind. “There is a complex range of factors, including longing for families left in the North, and emotional and economic difficulties that emerge while resettling,” the unification ministry official said. “The government has been continuing efforts to improve our support programmes to help them better resettle in the South.”;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/double-defector-who-returned-to-north-korea-struggled-financially-in-south;1
432;432;5679;5679;Elizabeth Holmes trial: jury finds Theranos founder guilty on four fraud counts;2022-01-04T10:23:24Z;['Kari Paul'];['Theranos', 'Technology', 'Law (US)', 'US news', 'California', 'Silicon Valley'];"Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, has been found guilty on four of 11 charges of fraud, concluding a high-profile trial that captivated Silicon Valley and chronicled the missteps of the now-defunct blood testing startup. The jury found Holmes guilty of several charges – including conspiracy to defraud investors – following a dramatic day in which jurors said they remained deadlocked on three of the criminal counts she faced.
On Monday, the seventh day of deliberations, the jury told US district judge Edward Davila that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on those three charges. In response, Davila encouraged them to deliberate further, but jurors later returned and rendered their final decision. As the verdict was read, the Theranos founder bowed her head, remained seated and expressed no visible emotion. Her partner, Billy Evans, showed agitation in earlier moments but appeared calm during the verdict reading. Holmes was found guilty on four charges: one count of conspiracy to defraud investors, and three counts of wire fraud against investors. Holmes was meanwhile acquitted on three charges, including one conspiracy to defraud patients and two charges related to patients who received inaccurate test results. One charge was thrown out earlier in the trial, and the jury did not come to a verdict on the remaining three charges. The verdict seals Holmes’ extraordinary rise and fall and could have wide-ranging consequences for the tech industry. It also marked an indictment of the hype machine that helped rocket Holmes to fame, as she graced the covers of major magazines, headlined conferences, and drew comparisons to Apple’s Steve Jobs. The split verdicts are “a mixed bag for the prosecution, but it’s a loss for Elizabeth Holmes because she is going away to prison for at least a few years”, said David Ring, a lawyer who has been following the Holmes case closely. Holmes, 37, faces prison time, although a sentencing date has not been set. She pleaded not guilty and is expected to appeal. After the judge left the courtroom to meet with jurors individually, Holmes got up to hug her partner Billy Evans and her parents before leaving with her lawyers. Over the course of nearly four months, federal prosecutors called 29 witnesses, outlining missteps and alleged fraud Holmes committed during her 15-year reign as CEO. Holmes founded the company after dropping out of Stanford at 19 years old, promising a revolutionary technology that could run hundreds of health tests on just a drop of blood. But the company ultimately fell short of its ambitious pledge. Once a charismatic figure, Holmes was initially hailed as a visionary. As Theranos grew, the company attracted big-name investors including the former secretaries of state George Shultz and Henry Kissinger. At its height, Theranos was valued at more than $9bn. But cracks in the glossy surface began to show in 2015 when Wall Street Journal reporting revealed that its in-house tests had massive inaccuracies, and that the company was performing other tests using traditional blood drawing methodology and outside labs. The fall of Theranos has been followed with perhaps even more fervor than its spectacular rise, inspiring multiple documentaries, a feature film, and an upcoming television show. Starting in late August, throngs of reporters have lined up in the early morning hours for a seat inside the federal court house in San Jose, California. During the trial, prosecutors painted a picture of Holmes as a strict, power-hungry leader willing to go to any lengths to save her company’s image, repressing internal and external dissent and manipulating the press. “She chose fraud over business failure,” prosecutor Jeff Schenk said in his closing arguments. “She choose to be dishonest with investors and patients. That choice was not only callous, it was criminal.” As witnesses, the prosecution called forward Theranos lab directors who testified that their concerns over the technology’s shortcomings were largely ignored. Meanwhile, investors such as the former US secretary of defense James Mattis said he and others were discouraged from scrutinizing the company for fear of missing out on opportunities.
The defense team for Holmes sought to counter that image by portraying Holmes as an ambitious entrepreneur who did not knowingly commit fraud, but rather did not understand the shortcomings of Theranos’ complex technology. Those arguments came to a head when Holmes made the stunning decision to take the stand in her own defense, arguing she made decisions in good faith and did not knowingly commit fraud. Prosecutors repeatedly pointed to documents that Holmes admitted to doctoring before sharing with potential partners, adding the logos of pharmaceutical firms and falsely implying they had endorsed the methodology. “I wish I hadn’t done that,” she told the jury on the stand. Her defense team stated in closing arguments that the logo evidence was “a distraction” and that Holmes was in talks with those companies at the time. Her attorneys also put forward a line of defense that Holmes was abused by her former romantic and business partner Sunny Balwani, who served for ten years as co-president of the company. “There was another side of Holmes’s relationship with Balwani that the public never saw,” said defense attorney Lance Wade in opening arguments, adding that “trusting [Balwani] as her primary adviser was one of her mistakes”. Some of the most powerful moments in the trial came when Holmes testified directly about Balwani’s alleged abuse, growing emotional as the prosecution called on her to read their romantic texts. She claimed he controlled what she did, who she spent time with, and even what she ate in an effort to turn her into a successful CEO. Balwani has strongly denied claims of mistreating Holmes. He faces his own trial in 2022 for fraud. Holmes did not respond to questions lobbed at her during a walk from the courthouse to the nearby hotel on Monday where she has stayed during jury deliberations. In a written statement, the US attorney Stephanie Hinds thanked the jury for navigating the case through the pandemic and said Holmes must now be held “culpable” for her crimes. Holmes will remain free on bond while awaiting sentencing, which will be determined by the judge.

434;434;5681;5681;The next US civil war is already here – we just refuse to see it;2022-01-04T10:00:12Z;['Stephen Marche'];['The far right', 'Republicans', 'US politics', 'US news'];"Nobody wants what’s coming, so nobody wants to see what’s coming. On the eve of the first civil war, the most intelligent, the most informed, the most dedicated people in the United States could not see it coming. Even when Confederate soldiers began their bombardment of Fort Sumter, nobody believed that conflict was inevitable. The north was so unprepared for the war they had no weapons. In Washington, in the winter of 1861, Henry Adams, the grandson of John Quincy Adams, declared that “not one man in America wanted the civil war or expected or intended it”. South Carolina senator James Chestnut, who did more than most to bring on the advent of the catastrophe, promised to drink all the blood spilled in the entire conflict. The common wisdom at the time was that he would have to drink “not a thimble”.
The United States today is, once again, headed for civil war, and, once again, it cannot bear to face it. The political problems are both structural and immediate, the crisis both longstanding and accelerating. The American political system has become so overwhelmed by anger that even the most basic tasks of government are increasingly impossible. The legal system grows less legitimate by the day. Trust in government at all levels is in freefall, or, like Congress, with approval ratings hovering around 20%, cannot fall any lower. Right now, elected sheriffs openly promote resistance to federal authority. Right now, militias train and arm themselves in preparation for the fall of the Republic. Right now, doctrines of a radical, unachievable, messianic freedom spread across the internet, on talk radio, on cable television, in the malls. The consequences of the breakdown of the American system is only now beginning to be felt. January 6 wasn’t a wake-up call; it was a rallying cry. The Capitol police have seen threats against members of Congress increase by 107%. Fred Upton, Republican representative from Michigan, recently shared a message he had received: “I hope you die. I hope everybody in your family dies.” And it’s not just politicians but anyone involved in the running of the electoral system. Death threats have become a standard aspect of the work life of election supervisors and school board members. A third of poll workers, in the aftermath of 2020, said they felt unsafe.
Under such conditions, party politics have become mostly a distraction. The parties and the people in the parties no longer matter much, one way or the other. Blaming one side or the other offers a perverse species of hope. “If only more moderate Republicans were in office, if only bipartisanship could be restored to what it was.” Such hopes are not only reckless but irresponsible. The problem is not who is in power, but the structures of power. The United States has burned before. The Vietnam war, civil rights protests, the assassination of JFK and MLK, Watergate – all were national catastrophes which remain in living memory. But the United States has never faced an institutional crisis quite like the one it is facing now. Trust in the institutions was much higher during the 1960s. The Civil Rights Act had the broad support of both parties. JFK’s murder was mourned collectively as a national tragedy. The Watergate scandal, in hindsight, was evidence of the system working. The press reported presidential crimes; Americans took the press seriously. The political parties felt they needed to respond to the reported corruption. You could not make one of those statements today with any confidence. ••• Two things are happening at the same time. Most of the American right have abandoned faith in government as such. Their politics is, increasingly, the politics of the gun. The American left is slower on the uptake, but they are starting to figure out that the system which they give the name of democracy is less deserving of the name every year. An incipient illegitimacy crisis is under way, whoever is elected in 2022, or in 2024. According to a University of Virginia analysis of census projections, by 2040, 30% of the population will control 68% of the Senate. Eight states will contain half the population. The Senate malapportionment gives advantages overwhelmingly to white, non– college educated voters. In the near future, a Democratic candidate could win the popular vote by many millions of votes and still lose. Do the math: the federal system no longer represents the will of the American people. The right is preparing for a breakdown of law and order, but they are also overtaking the forces of law and order. Hard right organization have now infiltrated so many police forces – the connections number in the hundreds – that they have become unreliable allies in the struggle against domestic terrorism.
Michael German, a former FBI agent who worked undercover against domestic terrorists during the 1990s, knows that the white power sympathies within police departments hamper domestic terrorism cases. “The 2015 FBI counter-terrorism guide instructs FBI agents, on white supremacist cases, to not put them on the terrorist watch list as agents normally would do,” he says. “Because the police could then look at the watchlist and determine that they are their friends.” The watchlists are among the most effective techniques of counter-terrorism, but the FBI cannot use them. The white supremacists in the United States are not a marginal force; they are inside its institutions. Recent calls to reform or to defund the police have focused on officers’ implicit bias or policing techniques. The protesters are, in a sense, too hopeful. Activist white supremacists in positions of authority are the real threat to American order and security. “If you look at how authoritarian regimes come into power, they tacitly authorize a group of political thugs to use violence against their political enemies,” German says. “That ends up with a lot of street violence, and the general public gets upset about the street violence and says, ‘Government, you have to do something about this street violence,’ and the government says, ‘Oh my hands are tied, give me a broad enabling power and I will go after these thugs.’ And of course once that broad power is granted, it isn’t used to target the thugs. They either become a part of the official security apparatus or an auxiliary force.” Anti-government patriots have used the reaction against Black Lives Matter effectively to build a base of support with law enforcement. “One of the best tactics was adopting the blue lives matter patch. I’m flabbergasted that police fell for that, that they actually support these groups,” German says. “It would be one thing if [anti-government patriots] had uniformly decided not to target police any more. But they haven’t. They’re still killing police. The police don’t seem to get it, that the people you’re coddling, you’re taking photographs with, are the same people who elsewhere kill.” The current state of American law enforcement reveals an extreme contradiction: the order it imposes is rife with the forces that provoke domestic terrorism. Just consider: in 2019, 36% of active duty soldiers claimed to have witnessed “white supremacist and racist ideologies in the military”, according to the Military Times. ••• At this supreme moment of crisis, the left has divided into warring factions completely incapable of confronting the seriousness of the moment. There are liberals who retain an unjustifiable faith that their institutions can save them when it is utterly clear that they cannot. Then there are the woke, educational and political elites dedicated to a discourse of willed impotence. Any institution founded by the woke simply eats itself – see TimesUp, the Women’s March, etc – becoming irrelevant to any but a diminishing cadre of insiders who spend most of their time figuring out how to shred whoever’s left. They render themselves powerless faster than their enemies can. What the American left needs now is allegiance, not allyship. It must abandon any imagined fantasies about the sanctity of governmental institutions that long ago gave up any claim to legitimacy. Stack the supreme court, end the filibuster, make Washington DC a state, and let the dogs howl, and now, before it is too late. The moment the right takes control of institutions, they will use them to overthrow democracy in its most basic forms; they are already rushing to dissolve whatever norms stand in the way of their full empowerment. The right has recognized what the left has not: that the system is in collapse. The right has a plan: it involves violence and solidarity. They have not abjured even the Oath Keepers. The left, meanwhile, has chosen infighting as their sport. There will be those who say that warnings of a new civil war is alarmist. All I can say is that reality has outpaced even the most alarmist predictions. Imagine going back just 10 years and explaining that a Republican president would openly support the dictatorship of North Korea. No conspiracy theorist would have dared to dream it. Anyone who foresaw, foresaw dimly. The trends were apparent; their ends were not. It would be entirely possible for the United States to implement a modern electoral system, to restore the legitimacy of the courts, to reform its police forces, to root out domestic terrorism, to alter its tax code to address inequality, to prepare its cities and its agriculture for the effects of climate change, to regulate and to control the mechanisms of violence. All of these futures are possible. There is one hope, however, that must be rejected outright: the hope that everything will work out by itself, that America will bumble along into better times. It won’t. Americans have believed their country is an exception, a necessary nation. If history has shown us anything it’s that the world doesn’t have any necessary nations.
The United States needs to recover its revolutionary spirit, and I don’t mean that as some kind of inspirational quote. I mean that, if it is to survive, the United States will have to recover its revolutionary spirit. The crises the United States now faces in its basic governmental functions are so profound that they require starting over. The founders understood that government is supposed to work for living people, rather than for a bunch of old ghosts. And now their ghostly constitution, worshipped like a religious document, is strangling the spirit that animated their enterprise, the idea that you mold politics to suit people, not the other way around. Does the country have the humility to acknowledge that its old orders no longer work? Does it have the courage to begin again? As it managed so spectacularly at the birth of its nationhood, the United States requires the boldness to invent a new politics for a new era. It is entirely possible that it might do so. America is, after all, a country devoted to reinvention. Once again, as before, the hope for America is Americans. But it is time to face what the Americans of the 1850s found so difficult to face: The system is broken, all along the line. The situation is clear and the choice is basic: reinvention or fall.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/next-us-civil-war-already-here-we-refuse-to-see-it;5
435;435;5682;5682;Resistance: 1942 review – Jason Patric smuggles quality into worthy war tale;2022-01-04T10:00:12Z;['Phil Hoad'];['Film', 'Drama films', 'War films', 'Second world war', 'Period and historical films', 'Culture', 'World news'];"There is the kernel of a good idea in this second world war drama: a Gestapo officer (Sebastian Roché) in occupied France is invited to a dinner at a Côte d’Azur villa where the serving staff are, unbeknown to him, the rebel radio broadcaster (Cary Elwes), dissidents and Jewish fugitives he has been hunting all along. Unfortunately, Matthew Hill and Landon Johnson’s timid film fails to fully capitalise on this uncomfortable scenario and misses opportunities elsewhere, instead going big on self-satisfied pieties about fighting the just fight.
Elwes’s Jacques is the gravelly voice of freedom in wartime Lyon, bidding insurgents over the airwaves to “stay safe” from his garret. But when his daughter Juliet (Greer Grammer) is almost caught filching a radio vacuum tube, she takes refuge in the office of Swiss financier Andre (Jason Patric). Her desperation is unrefusable – and her debutante looks don’t harm her either. Soon, with chief goose-stepper Klaus Jager closing in, Andre agrees to smuggle her and her household-in-hiding to his Mediterranean mansion.
Resistance: 1942 has English-language dialogue throughout, with – weirdly – only the Nazis doing “Cherman” inflections. (Having the French characters follow suit would probably have been too ’Allo ’Allo!) By far the most damagingly inauthentic thing, though, is Elwes’ oddly detached, borderline-parodic performance. Maybe the impish presence he showcased in The Princess Bride would have been a perverse fit here if the film had dug more deeply into what a life of subterfuge means in practice, culminating in his dissembling butler at the reception. But we learn little about Jacques, and Elwes starches his turn with so much caricatural stiff upper lip, ’Allo ’Allo! might in fact have been his primary research material. As written here, the ambiguous Andre – who channels Nazi money – is a much more interesting character; a kind of Oskar Schindler lite. Patric’s inscrutable performance recedes intriguingly while Elwes over-reaches, suggesting a man locked in internal combat. But beyond facile montages in which Jacques’ radio addresses uplift no one in particular, the directors don’t make a case for why heroism is ultimately the more compelling. • Resistance: 1942 is released on digital platforms on 10 January.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/04/resistance-1942-review;4
436;436;5683;5683;My new year’s resolution: to savour magic of playing as much five-a-side as possible;2022-01-04T09:50:33Z;['Elis James'];['Football', 'Sport'];"I look back at my list of failed New Year’s Eve resolutions with detached amusement. A few were vain attempts to improve myself (realistically, was I going to learn the harmonica or grow my own beetroot?), some reflected my concerns at the time (“I probably should touch it less, just in case it does drop off”) and as I aged others felt simple but somehow unachievable (eg 2018’s “have a shower before the school run”). My new year’s resolution for this year, however, will be achieved. Quite simply, it’s to play as much five-a-side as possible. Like most football fans, I’ve been playing the game for as long as I can remember. I grew up with loads of kids my own age on an estate of starter homes, which – coupled with a local primary school headteacher who thought that homework damaged children – created the perfect conditions to play football every day. I commentated on the matches we played in the park, I commentated on the kickabouts played in the hall of my friend’s house: “And the ball’s taken a wicked deflection off the Yellow Pages! LOOK AT HIS FACE, JUST LOOK AT HIS FACE!” Growing up in west Wales, where to PE teachers rugby union was king and football wasn’t played in lessons, I took part in unofficial matches between schools organised by the pupils. Football’s enforced absence during the pandemic has restored my enthusiasm to these teenage levels. In fact, to levels of eagerness not seen since Ian Rush played for Juventus.
Although I never played 11-a-side Sunday League football, I did play in a competitive five-a-side league for most of my 20s. This saw levels of hostility I hadn’t expected before signing up. A bloke squared up to me during one game and said that he’d knock me out in the car park, even though I was turning out for a regional gas pipe company and he was representing the call centre of a big insurance firm – all that pent-up aggression and we weren’t even playing in one of the big utility company derbies that are so common at Tuesday night five-a-side. “It’s EDF versus British Gas here at Cardiff Powerleague, AND IT’S LIVE.” As much as I loved playing, and my mind often returns to goals I scored in those games more than 15 years ago, that very angry bloke (who signed off with the brilliantly 1960s insult of “you longhaired freak”) is a good example of what I’m trying to avoid in the games I now play in as a man in my 40s. The right ethos is essential. I already play in one game where the attitude is perfect, but having played so little in 2020 a match a week just doesn’t feel like enough any more. If I’m asked to make up the numbers for somebody else, finding out if shinpads are usually worn is a good indicator of what the game will be like. Friends I’ve played with since primary school will confirm that I’ve never thrown myself into tackles like Bryan Robson during a World Cup group game, but at 41 I don’t want to have my tib and fib broken by some meathead from Kent who works in recruitment and no longer loves his wife. As a self-confessed luxury player (trans: genetically unable to get stuck in, a lot of what I try doesn’t come off, the talent I do have is largely unappreciated in England) I would ideally like to play with nine other people who are a laugh and slightly less good than I am, so I can score lots of goals and kid myself as I drive home that I could have played at a higher level.
This is the magic of playing football. I’ve interviewed professional footballers who haven’t kicked a ball since they retired, and yet when I kick the ball I could be 11 again. All the people I play with are the same. The only difference is that I now wear the boots my mum wouldn’t buy me in 1991 because they were too expensive, and I’ve come to accept that, age-wise, I’ve progressed from being “a senior pro” to “elder statesman of the dressing room” to “can his creaking limbs cope with one more campaign” to “club legend devastated to have contract terminated” before settling finally into the “young manager has new ideas” phase of my life. Thankfully, I’m usually playing against people closer in age to Eddie Howe than Erling Haaland. Five-a-side is the most accessible format of the world’s most popular sport, and as football is so ubiquitous, most players have a certain degree of competence. I love riding my bike, but when I’m cycling to Tesco to buy an onion and some AAA batteries I don’t kid myself that what I’m doing is the same as Geraint Thomas gritting his teeth during the Alpe d’Huez stage of the Tour de France. But even though I know it’s not true, a goal being lashed in with your weaker foot, an intelligent lay-off to a teammate, dribbling past an off-balance full-back will make me think: ‘Yes. I am Ferenc Puskas and I somehow slipped through the net.’ And then I will trip over my own feet or the ball will bounce off my shin and I will concede that actually: ‘I think the net was probably right to let me drift off into the Irish Sea.’
I have watched too many American football documentaries where the coach will tell his young players that if they fail to make the high school play-offs, this will be the final game they ever take part in. There is no real comparable NFL equivalent to five-a-side. Thankfully though, the kind of football I like can be played into old age. If you ask me, I will play. Just don’t expect me to track back.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/04/my-new-years-resolution-to-savour-magic-of-playing-as-much-five-a-side-as-possible;7
437;437;5684;5684;Doherty Institute boss says rapid antigen tests should be free in Australia;2022-01-04T09:48:43Z;['Sarah Martin', 'Michael McGowan'];['Australian politics', 'Scott Morrison', 'Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Health'];"The head of the influential Doherty Institute, Prof Sharon Lewin, has added her voice to the growing chorus of experts who are calling for rapid Covid tests to be provided free of charge in Australia, as Omicron causes havoc across the country. A record of nearly 50,000 new Covid cases was reported nationwide on Tuesday as state health systems groaned under the increasing demand and experts warned the peak of infections was likely weeks away. As the Morrison government defended its failure to secure sufficient rapid antigen tests to deal with the surging national test demand, the deputy chief health officer, Dr Sonya Bennett, sought to reassure Australians there were “plenty of tests” on their way. She also played down concerns there may be many more undetected cases in the community, saying this demonstrated that the Omicron variant was proving to be milder than the Delta strain. “There’s certainly many more cases of Covid out in the community that we’re not aware of, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing,” Bennett said on Tuesday.
“Where we’re seeing … in younger people, it’s very mild, many might not know they have it, or it’s just a sniffle. “So they’re not overly unwell and it does mean then you get a natural boost from that in the population, and it also would indicate that … the impact on the system is even less than we anticipate now.” She suggested the country would eventually move away from the current Covid testing regime, which was revised by national cabinet last week, as the virus became endemic and more like the flu. National cabinet will meet again on Wednesday when state and territory leaders will finalise plans for concessional access to rapid antigen tests, and assess the latest information on the virus spread, the vaccine rollout, the health system capacity and the current testing rules. Lewin, the director of the Doherty Institute whose advice has been central to Australia’s pandemic response, agreed on Tuesday that people should not have to pay for rapid antigen tests. “We’ve now begun to heavily rely on antigen testing which I think makes sense when we have such big numbers, and the shortage of antigen tests is a real problem at the moment, and I think also access to those tests really has to be free,” she told ABC TV’s 7.30 program. “The beauty of our healthcare system, and it is the absolute plank of our public health approach, [is] free access, equitable access for absolutely everyone. “So if we’re going to rely on antigen testing, and I think we can do some really innovative things with antigen tests and it may even give us additional freedoms in certain situations, they really have to be widely accessible and free.” Lewin said she was increasingly concerned about the rate of hospitalisations, saying that while the Omicron variant was milder, the increasing caseload and high levels of furloughed staff were creating new stresses. “The numbers are showing no signs of slowing down, unfortunately,” she said. “I’m getting increasingly concerned about pressures on our healthcare system. Numbers of hospitalisations are increasing. They’re not increasing at the same rate as in previous waves [but there are a] lot of emergency department attendances, which is causing significant stress on the system.” There were 47,738 cases of Covid recorded nationally on Tuesday, taking Australia’s total number of cases since the pandemic began to more than 500,000. Hospitalisation rates have almost doubled in the past week up to 2,362, with 184 of those in intensive care. All states expect WA reported new record highs, with NSW reporting 23,131 infections, while Victoria reported 14,020 and Queensland 5699. There were 3,246 cases in South Australia, 926 in the ACT, 702 in Tasmania, and 75 in the Northern Territory. The growing number of infections is already putting strain on the country’s hospital network, with staff shortages exacerbated by furloughing contributing to an “exhausted” workforce. More than 2,000 health workers are currently furloughed in NSW, and Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday that some workers who had tested positive were being called in to work if asymptomatic. Testing sites continue to be overwhelmed, with clinic closures across the country adding pressure to already strained pathology services. The demand for take-home testing kits, known as rapid antigen tests, is being hampered by supply constraints. But the strain on the health and testing network is expected to worsen, with Bennett saying the experience of the Omicron wave overseas was for a “short sharp rise” in infections. She said case numbers would probably keep rising for several weeks before plateauing, aided by the booster rollout. “We will probably continue to see cases increase over the next few weeks but by February, I’d expect, with the booster program in place as well, that we should see it plateauing and cases starting to come down,” Bennett said. “There are things that we need to do now, that we can do now to work together to bring those case numbers under control, and I’d just like to reiterate that the booster program is the single most important thing that we can do,” she said. An extra four million people became eligible for boosters on Tuesday, with the gap for second and third doses now reduced to four months. The gap will shorten again at the end of January to a three-month interval. The federal finance minister, Simon Birmingham, said booster shots were key to managing the outbreak, and he said the Omicron variant was responsible for the surge in cases and testing numbers. “Obviously, Omicron has once again changed the Covid landscape incredibly significantly. The much more highly transmissible nature of Omicron has seen a surge in case numbers, well above what had been anticipated under modelling related to Delta,” he said. “We’re responding to that by procuring more rapid antigen tests, by refining the definitions around assessing and testing, and to make sure that it is targeted to those who most truly need it and by ensuring that supports will be in place for those who need financial assistance in accessing rapid antigen tests.” The Coalition has been resisting calls to make the tests free for everyone, prompting criticism from welfare groups, medical experts and Labor. The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, slammed the government, saying it was responsible for the “largest public policy failure in Australian political history”. “Australians are being told, ‘You’re on your own and go out and get a rapid antigen test’, but they’re not available in so many areas,” Albanese said. “If people are lucky enough to find one, they’re not affordable and for many people, it’s simply pricing out access to important healthcare.” Albanese has resisted calling for the tests to be free but later on Tuesday he told the ABC he “would have no problem with that”. His counterpart in NSW, Chris Minns, went further, saying the tests “need to be free of charge”.
The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission announced on Tuesday that it would investigate claims of price gouging for rapid antigen tests, accusing some businesses of “cartel” conduct and calling for consumers to dob in retailers doing the wrong thing. “We have the ability to name and shame people if they are doing the wrong thing,” the ACCC chair, Rod Sims, said. But amid the widespread shortages, Bennett defended the health department’s strategy for rapid antigen tests, saying the department had modelled various scenarios but it was not possible to predict the “pathway” the virus would take. “This is a problem that we’re seeing around the globe. I think the sheer increase in numbers with Omicron, while everyone knew it was more transmissible, it’s happening very quickly,” she said. “But testing is accessible and will become even more accessible very shortly.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/doherty-institute-boss-says-rapid-antigen-tests-should-be-free-in-australia;6

In California District Court on Monday, Judge Fernando M Olguin dismissed the case “with leave to amend”. Lawyers for Elden missed the deadline to file an opposition to the Nirvana estate’s request to dismiss the case made in December. His team have until 13 January to refile. In the lawsuit filed in August, Elden claimed he was the victim of child sexual exploitation and that the cover artwork was a child sexual abuse image. “Defendants knowingly produced, possessed and advertised commercial child pornography depicting Spencer,” the lawsuit read. Elden said that appearing on the cover of Nevermind caused him “extreme and permanent emotional distress with physical manifestations”, plus loss of education, wages and “enjoyment of life”.
Lawyers for the band’s estate – surviving members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic; Courtney Love, Cobain’s widow and executor; and Kirk Weddle, the photographer of the cover image – said Elden had “spent three decades profiting from his celebrity as the self-anointed ‘Nirvana Baby’”, recreating the image on the album’s 15th and 20th anniversaries, and tattooing the album’s title on his chest. They stated that the statute of limitations on such a case expired more than a decade ago, and that Elden’s claims that the image constituted child sexual abuse were spurious. “A brief examination of the photograph, or Elden’s own conduct (not to mention the photograph’s presence in the homes of millions of Americans who, on Elden’s theory, are guilty of felony possession of child pornography) makes that clear.”";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/04/nirvana-nevermind-baby-cover-artwork-lawsuit-dismissed;4

Zenit St Petersburg striker Sardar Azmoun is the latest name on a shopping list that already features Lille defender Sven Botman, Atlético Madrid full-back Kieran Trippier, Everton’s Lucas Digne, Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, River Plate attacker Julián Álvarez, and south Devon utility man Thomas Cobley. We’re all going to have to get used to this quick-smart. It’s going to be a long month. Meanwhile the fuss and furore over Romelu Lukaku’s love letter to Internazionale is giving cover to a couple of Chelsea defenders making a bolt for the door marked Do One. Andreas Christensen, out of contract in the summer, may leave for Barcelona in a cut-price deal, while Antonio Rüdiger is eyeing a move to Real Madrid but will consider Bayern Munich, PSG or Juventus should talks turn sour.
Barcelona also claim they’re in the mix for Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland, presumably having found a loose £200m down the back of that tatty old settee. Perhaps the Catalan paupers will raise the cash by offloading Ousmane Dembélé to Newcastle, whose latest mention may lock the Mill into a screeching feedback loop, so turn down your speakers and/or take out those buds you got for Christmas. Barça are also hopeful of securing the services of Álvaro Morata, currently on loan at Juventus from Atletico Madrid, and offloading Philippe Coutinho, though that story is as old as references to Widecombe Fair. Arsenal are in the mix for Netherlands midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, whose dream move to Paris Saint-Germain has turned into, if not a nightmare, then a fitful sleep on a hot evening under nylon bedsheets. The Gunners are also reportedly close to a deal for Real Sociedad and Sweden striker Alexander Isak. Ainsley Maitland-Niles could pass him on the way out, heading for a loan spell at Roma, while Bukayo Saka fancies a move to Liverpool, it says here.
Manchester United want West Ham midfielder Declan Rice, and are willing to spend upwards of £100m for his signature. They’re also in for Barcelona and Uruguay defender Ronald Araújo, who is desirous of a pay rise at his current club but has yet to trouser one. Liverpool are also interested. Watford plan to snaffle defender Samir from Udinese, and may send Christian Kabasele the other way.

As countries brace for further waves of infections driven by the Omicron variant, the families of 14 people who lost their lives tell of incalculable loss as they pay tribute to their loved ones.
Ruth Lopes Rodrigues, 80, and Rosemeire Lopes Rodrigues Bortolin, 54, Brazil Ruth Lopes Rodrigues, 80, and her daughter Rosemeire Lopes Rodrigues Bortolin, 54, lived in São Paulo and died 15 days apart in early 2021. Rodrigues was hospitalised on 13 December 2020 after she fell and broke her femur. Bortolin decided to visit her mother in hospital on 29 December because she missed her so much. “Rose was so afraid of getting Covid, but she felt she had to visit her mom,” her cousin Liliane Bacci, 52, said. “She got emotional when she saw her mother and kissed her, even though she had been really careful throughout the pandemic and wore a mask everywhere.” The next day, on 30 December, Rodrigues was diagnosed with Covid-19. She deteriorated rapidly and was intubated two days later. Bortolin was hospitalised with Covid on 6 January. Rodrigues died on 18 January, a day after her 80th birthday, which she shared with her daughter, who turned 54. Bortolin was intubated on 21 January, and died on 2 February. “They were two women carrying their family, and now they’re gone,” Bacci said. “Rose was like a sister to me. I miss them so much. If it hadn’t been for my aunt’s fall, I think both of them would be alive now.” Oduetse Ratshipa, 41, Botswana
Dr Oduetse ‘Odie’ Ratshipa was born in Serowe on 23 June 1980. He studied medicine at St George’s University, Grenada, and graduated in 2010. He then returned to Botswana to work for the Ministry of Health and Wellness in the capital, Gaborone, for 11 years, later specialising in disease surveillance and outbreaks. In 2014, he had a lung transplant after being diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The transplant left him vulnerable but he was determined to continue his work. During the pandemic, Ratshipa was working on the rollout of the vaccine and caught Covid after his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. “It’s a blow to have lost someone so young,” said his father-in-law, Peter Smith. “He was the bravest man I ever met.” Ratshipa loved playing chess and supported Chelsea football club. He died aged 41 on 7 August 2021, and is survived by his wife, Thato, and two sons Jason and James. Saeid Azari, 67, Iran
Saeid Azari, 67, was a businessman and philanthropist who lived in Tehran with his wife, while his two daughters were living in Canada. Azari died in hospital on 14 July 2020, 10 days after becoming ill with Covid. His family said his transfer to intensive care was delayed because of a shortage of beds. Covid restrictions meant his family was unable to hold the kind of memorial service they would have wanted, and said goodbye to him at a small funeral with strict social distancing in place. Azari’s younger daughter watched via video call from Canada. It was only after his death that his family discovered he had been sponsoring the studies of two orphans for years. Azari’s eldest daughter, Neda, 39, last saw her father in September 2019, when he hugged her goodbye at the airport after visiting her in Canada. She said: “He was a source of inspiration for my mother, my sister and I. He always had a sweet smile on his face and he encouraged us to pursue our dreams. He was a man who gave his daughters wings to fly. We love him so much and he is missed terribly, his death has completely changed our lives.” Jean Hodgson, 82, UK
Jean Hodgson, 82, lived her whole life in Manchester, where she ran a successful bakery and a fish and chip shop. She raised her three sons as a single mother while maintaining both businesses before marrying her husband, Jim, who died in 2012 from asbestosis after years working as a labourer. In February 2020, she had a heart attack and went into a care home, shortly before the pandemic properly began. She was supposed to stay there temporarily, as she wanted to live by herself with some assistance. But she contracted Covid and died on 8 August 2020. “The care home advised us that this was the safest place for her, which was obviously wrong,” her granddaughter Alexandra Hastie, 26, said. “I saw her five days before she died, and she was so happy, but we only saw her through the glass. We didn’t get the chance to say goodbye properly. “The extent of her warmth on others was clearly shown on the day of her funeral when the entire street came out to say their goodbyes and the amount of people that turned up outside the church. I have never known an 82-year-old as popular as my Nana Jean! Her favourite sandwich was cow tongue and ready salted crisps – the most disgusting combination I have ever seen but would give anything to see her enjoy once more.” Andrey Schelkonogov, 60, Russia
Andrey Schelkonogov, 60, a father of two and grandfather of three, lived in the Moscow region and was an engineer at a state-owned infrastructure company, a job he loved. His family believe he caught Covid either at work or on public transport. He was hospitalised on 18 October 2020. When Schelkonogov died on 5 November 2020, just three weeks before his 61st birthday, it was a huge shock to the family. “He was a big football fan and incredibly healthy and strong prior to his infection, we thought he would recover and come home after perhaps one week,” his daughter Julia, 36, said. That his coffin had to be closed during his funeral was also difficult for his family. “It was a huge disappointment that we were not allowed to see his face one last time,” she said. “My daughter was just three weeks old when he died. I had sent him photos of her while he was in hospital, as we couldn’t visit him, it was prohibited. He loved his grandchildren so much.” Şenol Yaşar, 55, Turkey
“I’ve lost my rock and now he’s no longer there,” said Deniz Aslan of her 55-year-old father, Şenol Yaşar. Yaşar, who was born on 12 February 1965 in Istanbul, worked in real estate and had three children. He is thought to have caught Covid while dining in a restaurant after the reopening of businesses and public spaces in June 2020. His family said he started off with flu-like symptoms and was hospitalised at a time when Turkey was recording some of its highest daily death figures of the pandemic. He was in intensive care for nearly three weeks before dying on 22 November 2020. “I couldn’t hold his hand and say the words which I desperately needed to say before it was too late,” said Aslan.

Juana Lema’s grandfathers Alberto Lema, 83, and Pedro ‘Toto’ Gallegos, 76, died from Covid in Buenos Aires on 9 April and 1 June 2021 respectively. Born on 14 September 1938, Alberto Lema was president of General Motors for Argentina and Latin America in the electro-motive division. He was hospitalised for two weeks before dying. Gallegos was born on 9 June 1945 and worked as a private driver. He always tried to make people laugh and had a “very unique personality”, said his granddaughter. His family believes he caught Covid when he had to renew his driving ID. He was put on a ventilator and given a tracheotomy two weeks after being hospitalised. He was released a fortnight later and spent less than 24 hours in a recovery centre before having a stroke due to Covid. Juana Lema said: “We were burying Alberto when we were told Pedro had to go into hospital with Covid. It’s been really hard as I’ve never lost anyone close to me.” Mosharef Hossain, 81, Bangladesh
Born in Noakhali on 9 January 1940, Mosharef Hossain worked for the Pakistani embassy in Islamabad, as a cypher assistant for years. He moved to the UK in 1971 before returning to Bangladesh in 2005 where he founded a school a year later. He caught Covid at the beginning of April 2021 and was hospitalised for 21 days. He was discharged and went home to where his wife lives in Dhaka to recover for a few weeks, but died on 22 June at the age of 81. His granddaughter Sabah Hussain said it had been three years since she last saw him: “We were really close when he lived in the UK and we thought it was a miracle when he recovered from Covid. His death came as a really big shock.” Bagila Zhakypbayeva, 81, Kazakhstan
Bagila Zhakypbayeva, 81, from Almaty, was born on 13 April 1940 and worked in administration before retiring. She liked making beautiful patchworks and singing. She lived with her daughter and stayed at home for most of the pandemic. However, both of them tested positive after Zhakypbayeva started feeling unwell. She was in hospital for 10 days and spent her last three days in intensive care. She asked to be taken home to die but died on 28 August 2021. “She was on her own and couldn’t be with the people who loved her,” said her granddaughter Nellya Serikova. “She sacrificed a lot of things for my sister and I when we were kids. We were so close.” Rimon George Sultanian, 76, Jordan
Rimon George Sultanian, 76, worked as a decorator and in construction in Amman before he retired. He was an orphaned refugee from Palestine and lived alone initially when he came to Jordan. He went on to have four children and six grandchildren. Sultanian contracted Covid in October 2020 and died in hospital on 10 December 2020. “My dad worked really, really hard all his life, even after his retirement, and sacrificed a lot for his family, so we could have the education and lifestyle he wanted us to have,” his daughter Armen, 33, a sales manager, said. “He had a difficult life but he always managed to not let us feel it.” Sultanian loved reading books, especially crime novels by Agatha Christie. “He would walk two times a week to book stores and a library and return with many books,” Armen said. “My dad was everything to us.” Gianpiero ‘Nonno’ Carlo Luigi Albertini, 89, UK
Gianpiero “Nonno” Carlo Luigi Albertini was born in London on 13 July 1930 to Italian parents who had moved from Italy after the first world war. He had three sisters and lived in Surrey. He served in the British army for two years and returned to his profession as a lawyer before retiring. “I have many happy memories of my nonno [grandfather in Italian],” said his granddaughter Isabel. “Like him giving us a bath when we were little and cleaning our feet by instructing: ‘One footy up’. He was a gentleman and a gentle man, always kind and polite to everyone regardless of who they were.” Albertini initially went in to be treated for kidney failure and had started to improve when he tested positive for Covid. He died four days later on 19 May 2020 at East Surrey hospital. He was 89. Albertini is survived by his four children and 10 grandchildren. Andrew Daly, 93, Ireland
Andrew “Andy” Daly, 93, was a greyhound breeder, owner and trainer from County Westmeath who was born on 20 November 1926. He settled in England after a career with the British army that involved time in Germany and Hong Kong. He took part in changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace and reportedly enjoyed drinks with Prince Phillip. After leaving the army he returned to Ireland in the 1970s and became a gun dog breeder and sold his dogs all over Europe and showed at Crufts. His granddaughter Claire Daly said he had an “incredible and eventful life and was much loved and respected by everyone he met and is much missed by us all”. In his later years he lived in a nursing home and suffered regularly from pneumonia. He contracted Covid early in the pandemic and died on 1 April 2020.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/he-gave-his-daughters-wings-to-fly-lives-of-14-people-lost-to-covid;7
441;441;5688;5688;Bring on the six-hour-long movies – it’s grandeur and scale we want now | Peter Bradshaw;2022-01-04T09:00:11Z;['Peter Bradshaw'];['Film', 'Culture', 'Television', 'UK news', 'Television & radio'];"How on earth are the movies going to compete with all that deliciously seductive #content on streaming services? How do you persuade people to mask up and venture out to the cinema when they can sprawl on the sofa and watch Succession’s gorgeously horrible Roy family for less money and hassle. People will leave their homes for James Bond and Spider-Man. But the grownup movies – the cinema of ideas and character and dialogue and complexity – well, people are increasingly tempted to stay home for those. James Cameron, director of mighty box-office champs such as Titanic and Avatar has the answer: six-hour films! Films with the amplitude and the addiction factor of long-form TV. At first glance, that sounds like a buttock-annihilating nightmare, and a six-hour film from the alpha-gorilla Cameron is another worry. Six hours of Cameron’s cheerfully macho storytelling? Six hours of military hardware, and people in flightsuits walking into vast hangars with fighter-planes? Or does Mr Cameron have a six-hour cut of Titanic up his sleeve? Actually, that’s not really what he’s suggesting. What Cameron has in mind is a new integrated theatrical-streaming distribution model in which a six-hour “movie” is shown in a number of episodes for home viewing and then in a shorter, slimmed-down two-hour version for movie theatres. It’s not out of the question – and it’s been done before. Olivier Assayas’s 2010 work Carlos, starring Édgar Ramírez as Carlos the Jackal was shown in three TV episodes totalling five-and-a-half hours but in cinemas shorter versions were shown. And for literary adaptations, it could make sense. After all, Granada Television’s legendary 11-episode version of Brideshead Revisited in 1981 weighed in at almost 12 hours: a different, perfectly plausible 2008 feature film version of the same novel came in at two hours 14 minutes. You could fuse the two concepts … couldn’t you? Film has traditionally responded to the threat from television by emphasising grandeur and scale. In the decades after the war, and worried about TV, Hollywood gave us epic movies, biblical and sword-and-sandal dramas, often shown in awe-inspiring widescreen mode. The threat to cinema is different here – now it’s almost as if television is the bigger form with an almost unlimited running time for its products. So maybe the Cameron model is workable.
The danger is of course that the cinema will just come off looking like second best. Who wants to see the short-change cut version of some sexy new drama in cinemas – which will inevitably also be subtly longer than the comfortable feature-film length – when you can get the real thing at home in full measure, and submit to the deferred, extended pleasure of episodic narrative, which is the whole point of TV entertainment? And of course, it would be the sex and violence that would get chopped for cinemas and bowdlerisation would rule. Of course, cinema is already giving us “serial” movies. Denis Villeneuve’s colossal new sci-fi Dune is only part one – part two is due to follow. And in the arthouse realm, Joanna Hogg’s autobiographical film The Souvenir came out in two parts. But this isn’t quite the same thing. And time is different watching TV – bingeing something for four hours is different from watching a four-hour movie: with the TV show you can bail out at any stage without inconvenience or feeling culturally shallow or disloyal. Not so in the cinema. Well, it would be interesting if Netflix or Amazon Prime tried the Cameron model. But what I’d really like – masochistically enough – is a six-hour movie culture that had the courage of its convictions: showing the actual six-hour films in cinemas. A new Bollywood-style sense of scale, to toughen up pampered western movie consumers. Cinephiles dream of finding the original eight-hour cut of the Erich von Stroheim 1924 silent drama Greed. I would love to see the rumoured 20-hour cut of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. At all events, I want to maintain the concept of committing to an entire created artwork, in its entirety, all at once, from beginning to end – and the cinema is still the best place for that.

442;442;5689;5689;Omicron infections may have plateaued in London, Neil Ferguson says;2022-01-04T08:33:12Z;['Matthew Weaver'];['Omicron variant', 'UK news', 'Coronavirus', 'London', 'Infectious diseases', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Health', 'Society'];"Prof Neil Ferguson, the scientist who helped shape Britain’s coronavirus lockdown strategy, said he was “cautiously optimistic” that Omicron infections had plateaued in London and could reduce in the next week. Ferguson, a mathematical epidemiologist from Imperial College London, cautioned that record cases numbers being reported were likely to be an underestimate because test supplies have run out in some areas. But speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “An epidemic reaching such high numbers can’t sustain those numbers forever. So we would expect to see case numbers start to come down in the next week, maybe already coming down in London, but in other regions a week to three weeks.” He added: “I’m cautiously optimistic that infection rates in London in that key 18 to 50 age group, which has been driving the Omicron epidemic, may possibly have plateaued. It is too early to say whether they’re going down yet.”
Ferguson also said that despite a recent doubling in Covid hospital admissions the vaccinations were proving effective at preventing severe disease. He said: “Vaccination is holding up in terms of protection against severe disease, assisted by the fact that Omicron almost certainly is substantially less severe, but it still puts pressures on the health system.” Ferguson said: “Omicron is substantially less severe. And that has helped us undoubtedly. We would be seeing much higher case numbers in hospital otherwise. And vaccines are holding up against severe disease and against severe outcomes well, but that doesn’t mean it’s not going to be difficult few weeks for the NHS.” Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the NHS did not want staff going back into hospitals with Covid and risk passing it on. He told Times Radio that reducing the self-isolation period to five days should be done only if the science “said it was absolutely safe”. On the general outlook, he said: “We should feel some hope and confidence about the medium term, [and] that we will gradually become more able to live with Covid as the prime minister has said, that when Omicron has gone through us that we make it to that stage and the NHS will recover.” But Taylor added: “On the other hand, we’ve got to recognise that in the next few weeks at least things are very, very difficult. One thing that people in our service find difficult is that it does seem as though there’s a kind of almost politicised attempt to suggest that things aren’t as difficult as they are, that any suggestion that we should sustain the restrictions or whether it’s personal responsibility or policy. “If you’re working in health service, you see the reality, and what you want politicians, what you want people, to be driven by is the data and what’s happening at the frontline, and let’s not be in the business of … getting away from the reality of this.”
He said the judgment on restrictions “needs to be driven by the data and what’s in the best interests of the country”, adding: “It shouldn’t be driven by a kind of political virility symbolism, where the sooner we can be free, the better it is, regardless of the effects. Let’s carry on being driven by the data.” The minister for vaccines and public health, Maggie Throup, said she was “not sure” how many Britons were currently in self-isolation. She told Sky News: “I’m not sure of that [actual] figure, but I think what’s shown over Christmas is that a lot of people have caught the disease, the Omicron variant is very transmissible, but what is good news, it doesn’t seem to be resulting in severe diseases as some of the other variants did.” She added: “Well, not everybody declares that they’re self-isolating, I think that’s one important thing, that it’s something that they do because they’ve tested positive or they’ve been in contact with somebody whose tested positive, they don’t have to report that in. “The vaccine is working and that’s the best way to stop the transmission, and to stop hospitalisations and for our life to get back to normal.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/omicron-infections-may-have-plateaued-in-london-neil-ferguson-says;3
443;443;5690;5690;‘I’d been set up’: the LGBTQ Kenyans ‘catfished’ for money via dating apps;2022-01-04T08:30:11Z;['Sarah Johnson'];['Global development', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'World news', 'Kenya', 'Grindr', 'Social media', 'Africa', 'Digital media', 'Media', 'Technology', 'Human rights'];"One day after work last month, Tom Otieno* went to a shopping centre in Nairobi to pick up groceries before heading home. He got a call from someone he had been chatting to for a week on Grindr, a social networking app for gay, bi, trans and queer people. The man had already tried ringing several times during the day while Otieno was with colleagues and was keen to meet. Otieno, 29, mentioned where he was but said that he did not want to see the man. Then, as he was heading to his car, he got another call. As he answered it, someone approached him and said they were a police officer. Seconds later, two other officers joined him and surrounded Otieno. “One of them had this envelope,” he says. “He was getting papers out of the envelope and looking at them and then at me. I saw it was a chat [from Grindr] and I saw my face on it. I knew I had been set up.” The police asked him to get in their car to “help with an investigation”. Otieno refused and they accused him of having sex with a minor and started getting violent. “One tried to cuff me by force. Then he punched me on the chest and bent me over the car bonnet.” Otieno agreed to go with them as long as they did not handcuff him. Once in the car, he realised they were taking a longer route to the station and started to panic.
“I felt I was going to die. A few months ago, I heard a transgender person was found dead and word went round that it was the police,” he says. Tom refused to hand over his phone to the police, even though they asked, because he knew he had done nothing wrong and they had not officially arrested him. He started to call friends, one of whom got in touch with a lawyer from the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (NGLHRC). She rang Otieno and said she would meet him at the police station. Once the police knew a lawyer was involved, they took Otieno to the station but not before threatening him and demanding money to “make everything go away”. Otieno’s experience on social media sites or dating apps of being “catfished” – as using a fake identity to lure someone online is known – by people intending to extort money is common among members of the LGBTQ+ community in Kenya. With section 162 of the colonial-era penal code criminalising sexual acts deemed “unnatural”, there are fertile grounds for the practice to thrive. Activists want social media companies to take action to stamp out the extortion. Kenya’s high court rejected a bid to repeal the law criminalising gay sex in 2019. There is another move to repeal section 162, which is at the root of this issue, now waiting to be heard in the court of appeal. Njeri Gateru, executive director of NGLHRC, says: “The existence of laws that criminalise homosexuality create a landscape where anyone attracted to someone of the same gender is seen to belong to a lesser place in society, and as a criminal. That creates room for people to take advantage of queer individuals.” According to Gateru, cases of blackmail and extortion are increasing, methods are becoming more sophisticated, and while this type of crime used to be limited to Nairobi, it has now spread to other areas of the country. Exact figures on its prevalence are hard to come by and Gateru estimates that only about 10% of cases are reported. The NGLHRC legal aid centre has dealt with 679 such cases since its inception in 2013. Other LGBTQ+ organisations in the country say they have anecdotal evidence of thousands of such cases.
Otieno, who works in finance, was aware enough of his rights that he questioned the police officers’ actions and rebuffed their efforts to extort bribes from him. Once he arrived at the station and met his lawyer, the minor the police claimed had wanted to press charges against him was suddenly unavailable. Otieno was not arrested or charged. Many other members of the LGBTQ+ community have ended up in dire situations after being catfished on social media and dating sites. Lawyers and caseworkers have reported cases where people have been beaten so severely that they required hospital treatment and some almost died. Others have been raped and robbed at gunpoint. Many have been forced to empty their bank accounts and pay bribes amounting to tens of thousands of pounds to their blackmailers. Perpetrators include police officers, but also other officials and members of the public. Bruno Shioso, speaking for the National Police Service, says these claims are “suspicious”. “Police don’t stalk citizens on social media. I don’t understand what the motivation would be,” he claims.
Kelly Kigera, of the emergency security response team at the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya, says blackmailers approach members of the LGBTQ+ community online, sometimes using “cute” fake pictures, to chat and gain their trust before arranging to meet. Sometimes they will take compromising pictures or videos, which they use to threaten to expose their victim’s sexual orientation. Other people report police officers storming into their homes, threatening them with prosecution under section 162. Kigera adds: “They take your phone, contacts, passwords. They see other gay men you’ve been talking to, and trace them using other platforms.” The pandemic has made everything worse, says Gateru: “There has been such a loss of income and livelihoods from within the community and some people have resorted to these means to try to make a living for themselves.” Activists say it is important to educate police officers about the rights of the LGBTQ+ community to try to avoid this happening. Gateru says she has made five allegations of misconduct to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) over the past two years. “Very little is done,” she says. “It’s very frustrating.” A spokesperson for the IPOA denies this: “The authority is not in receipt of any complaint falling within the ambit of police targeting individuals as a result of their sexual affiliation.” Many question whether the social media companies are doing enough to protect users. Gateru says: “It’s a very slow response from some sites, even when we report instances of blackmail. Action taken is minimal to none.”
A Grindr spokesperson says: “We are always saddened to hear about the difficult and sometimes tragic experiences that our community members have experienced both online and off.” He says that Grindr has published a security guide and safety tips and has weekly in-app messages to remind users to exercise caution in all aspects of life in countries where it is illegal to be gay. In Kenya, those messages include links to the NGLHRC. In Nairobi, Otieno is still recovering from his ordeal. Friends have since told him similar stories of abuse and extortion. He wants social media and dating sites to do more. “I really think they should do a lot more when it comes to eliminating such characters,” he says. “For most of us in Africa, [these sites] are the only avenue where we can meet people of our type. “If they are now a threat to us, something must be done,” he adds. “You can’t put people’s lives on ransom.” *Name has been changed to protect his identity Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:";https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/04/id-been-set-up-the-lgbtq-kenyans-catfished-for-money-via-dating-apps;2

Sui and Han, aged 26 and 29 respectively, have been skating together since 2007. They have developed a banter that charms fans, arguing and joking like an old married couple. Not many athletes would consider a silver medal at the Olympics a disappointment but losing by only 0.43 points in Pyeongchang was not what the team had hoped for. In Beijing, they will no doubt be vying for gold in front of the home crowd. Yuzuru Hanyu, figure skating There is not much this two-time Olympic champion has not accomplished. The beloved skater, a household name in Japan and one of the country’s most popular sportspeople, has broken the world record 19 times, which is a record in itself. He also boasts seven world championship medals and four Grand Prix Final titles. After each skate, fans will throw dozens of Winnie the Pooh toys onto the ice, a tradition that developed after Hanyu started carrying a tissue box in the shape of the bear. Competing in his third Olympics, the 26-year-old will be rivaling with Nathan Chen for gold. Eileen Gu, freestyle skiing In the past year, the American-born freestyle skier and soon-to-be Stanford student has quickly established herself as a podium contender for Beijing 2022, winning two golds at both the Winter X Games 2021 and the world championships. When she’s not on the slopes, Gu, who is also signed to IMG models, is sitting front row at Paris fashion week or appearing on the cover of Elle. The 18-year-old competes for China but grew up in the United States. Identifying as both American and Chinese, she hopes to help build a bridge the two nations and inspire future Chinese skiers.
Katie Ormerod, snowboarding At only 16, the British gymnast turned snowboarder became the first female to land a double cork 1080, an incredibly difficult move. Four years later, she flew to Pyeongchang as one of Britain’s best winter athletes. Unfortunately, she broke her heel during training and did not compete. Seven operations and a year of recovery later, Ormerod made a successful comeback by becoming the first British snowboarder to win a World Cup event. Set to compete in Beijing, the 24-year-old is focused on performing the best she can, regardless of results. Suzanne Schulting, short track The already accomplished Dutch athlete won gold in every event at world championships last March, proving herself unbeatable. She is only the second female speedskater to accomplish the sweep, with one of the victories being the Netherlands’ first ever women’s relay gold. Schulting, who has also competed in long track speedskating, will be eyeing multiple short track medals in Beijing, entering as the reigning 1000m Olympic champion. Liu Shaoang, short track The 23-year-old, who was born to a Chinese father and a Hungarian mother, grew up in Budapest and represents Hungary in short track. In 2018, Liu became an Olympic champion. Just a few months ago, he claimed his first world championship title in Netherlands, where his older brother also took home a gold for Hungary. Having trained in China, the Liu brothers have amassed lots of fans in Beijing and are looking forward to competing in the country they call a second home.
Sarah Nurse, ice hockey Playing for Canada’s hockey team, Nurse has one bronze and one gold medal from world championships in 2019 and 2021 respectively. In the 2018 Olympics, she scored a goal against the final against the US, where Canada lost in a shootout. With one silver medal under her belt, Nurse and the rest of the team are aiming for a victory in Beijing. The forward from Ontario, who is biracial, has also been very vocal about systemic racism in sports, universities and societies in general. Natalie Geisenberger, luge The 33-year-old from Germany is the most decorated female luger. Her Olympic debut came at Vancouver 2010, where she won a bronze medal. In the next two Olympics, she won two gold medals each. With this hardware collection, Geisenberger is tied with Tobias Arlt and Tobias Wendl for the most successful luge athlete of all time. Earlier this year, she took home silver in the women’s singles at her first world championships since giving birth to her son, Leo. Beijing will most likely be the new mother’s last Olympics, but she has no plans on retiring anytime soon.
Ireen Wüst, speed skating At 35, the Dutch speed skater has long solidified her legend status. Since becoming the youngest Dutch Olympic champion at 19, Wüst has been the most successful Olympian from the Netherlands and the most decorated speed skater of all time with 11 medals, five of them gold. Her other accomplishments include but are not limited to: being named Dutch Sportswoman of the Year twice, having an ice rink named after her, competing in the Dutch road cycling championships, and being the first Winter athlete to win gold medals at four consecutive Olympics. Markus Kleveland, snowboarding At 17, the Norwegian snowboarder landed a quad cork at his debut Winter X Games, becoming the first person to successfully compete the skill and winning his first of four X Games golds. Later that year, he was awarded Rookie of the Year by Snowboard Magazine. This year, the now-22-year-old secured his first world title in slopestyle while winning a bronze in big air. Like many snowboarders, Kleveland chases adrenaline outside of the snow by skateboarding, trampolining, biking and surfing. Beijing 2022 will most likely be his first Olympic games. Markéta Davidová, biathlon At her first world championships, Davidová finished in 43rd place. At her second, she placed eighth. This year, she won gold. The Czech biathlete shot a perfect 20 out of 20, beating the reigning Olympic champion to the world title just a year before Beijing. The 24-year-old, who also loves horseback riding, completed a bachelor’s degree in animal sciences while competing at the elite level. She finished 57th at the 2018 Olympics but that was four years ago. Now, she is entering Beijing with a high chance of a podium finish.
Francesco Friedrich, bobsleigh Considered one of the best bobsledders of all time, Friedrich has 13 world championship gold medals and 46 World Cup titles, a record that he broke at the beginning of this year. The 31-year-old first started bobsledding with his older brother, David. After two severe injuries, David retired but still supports his brother in all his success. At Pyeongchang, Friedrich took home two Olympic golds for Germany. Now, he is looking to defend his title in Beijing. Anna Hasselborg, curling Born into a family of curlers, the 32-year-old Swede was first introduced to the sport by her dad and her brother at age 7. She went on to achieve more success than not only her family members, but most curlers in the world. Now 32, Hasselborg is the reigning Olympic champion, two-time European champion, and two-time world silver medalist. In summer of 2020, she gave birth to a baby named Mira, who often sits by the rink and watches her train. Having already qualified for Beijing 2022, Hasselborg will be leading her team to defend their title. Pita Taufatofua, cross-country skiing You may know him as the oiled-up shirtless flagbearer for Tonga, but this taekwondo and cross-country skiing athlete has a life that is nothing short of inspiring. Taufatofua is not a medal contender, but simply competing in his second Winter Olympics as skier from a tropical country with a humble background is a major accomplishment. The many hardships he has encountered include numerous injuries, personal loss, financial instability and losing his childhood home to a tropical storm. Now a three-time Olympian, two Summer and one Winter, the 37-year-old also has an engineering degree and is an Unicef ambassador who works with homeless youth.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/04/winter-olympic-athletes-to-watch-beijing-games;4
445;445;5692;5692;Evergrande shares rise as they resume trading after suspension;2022-01-04T08:25:22Z;['Mark Sweney'];['Evergrande', 'Business', 'China', 'UK news', 'World news', 'Asia Pacific'];"Shares in the embattled Chinese property developer Evergrande rose on Tuesday after they resumed trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange following a suspension. China’s second-biggest developer halted trading on Monday after receiving an order from authorities at Danzhou city in Hainan on 30 December telling it to demolish 39 under-construction buildings at the Ocean Flower Island project. Shares in the company, whose market value has plunged almost 90% over the last year, jumped by 10% after they resumed trading on Tuesday and Evergrande announced that the demolition order would not affect the rest of its project at the Hainan resort. However, they later fell back to a rise of almost 2%.
It comes after Evergrande said its sales for 2021 had plunged 39% from the year before to $69.5bn (£51.6bn). The developer is struggling to repay more than $300bn in liabilities by selling assets and shares. Nearly $20bn of international market bonds were deemed to be in cross-default by ratings firms last month after the company missed payments. Evergrande missed new coupon payments worth $255m due last Tuesday, though both have a 30-day grace period. On Friday, Evergrande scaled back plans to repay investors in its wealth management products, saying each investor could expect to receive 8,000 yuan ($1,257) a month as principal payment for three months irrespective of when the investment matures. Altogether, Chinese property developers owed $19.8bn in US dollar-denominated offshore debt in the first three months of 2022, analysts at Nomura said last month. In the second quarter of this year, they must find another $18.5bn, while also meeting billions of repayments in local yuan debt.
Other developers at risk of default include Kaisa, which missed a huge repayment in December and which has twice suspended its shares in recent months. Its stock has lost 75% in value in the past year. Analysts at S&P have estimated that one-third of Chinese developers could face a liquidity crunch in the next 12 months. Developers must also find 1.1tn yuan in backdated pay owed to construction workers before the lunar new year starts at the beginning of February.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/evergrande-shares-rise-as-they-resume-trading-after-suspension;2

Beijing is holding on to its zero-Covid strategy ahead of the forthcoming Winter Olympics next month, and with local officials facing sanctions or sackings over outbreaks, cases have prompted increasingly strict responses. Authorities in Yuzhou, Henan province, announced the lockdown on Monday evening, ordering all residents to stay inside, and residential communities to post sentries at gates. Different parts of the city have varying rules – some are allowing people to enter but not exit while others allow neither.
Public transport has been suspended and no cars are allowed on the road except for epidemic response vehicles, and all shops, entertainment and leisure venues have been closed. Only businesses that are “guaranteeing the supply of daily life materials” can operate. Yuzhou’s locked down population join Xi’an in Shaanxi province, where a harsh lockdown has been in place for almost two weeks, including the requirement for negative tests before an individual can seek medical care. The city has recorded more than 1,700 cases since early December, and put tens of thousands in quarantine. All positive cases are taken to hospitals for treatment and isolation. While the strict response had drawn some concern and complaints including about food shortages, on Tuesday Communist party authorities demanded local officials “strictly and properly” implement restrictions. “The various work that needs to be done must only be strengthened,” said Liu Guozhong, the provincial head of the party in Shaanxi, of which Xi’an is its capital. The epidemic control effort is at a pivotal moment, Liu said. “We’d rather widen our identification of groups at risk than to overlook a single person,” he was quoted as saying in an article published by the Xi’an government on Tuesday. He said no one should be overlooked during mass testing in key Xi’an areas and “household doors” should be closely watched in rural parts of the city to make sure people are complying with travel curbs. The swift and extreme response in Yuzhou drew some concern online, with some commenters questioning the need to go so far over a handful of cases, but others were largely supportive, in line with apparent broad support for China’s continued policy of stamping out outbreaks. While most of the world is open and operating with huge case numbers, including some countries that previously pursued zero-Covid strategies, China has stuck with its policy of keeping the virus at bay, putting increasing pressure on local officials as they battle sporadic outbreaks. In Xi’an, two senior Communist party officials in the northern city were removed from their posts over their “insufficient rigour in preventing and controlling the outbreak”. In Guangxi, officials paraded pandemic rule-breakers through the public streets, with placards around their necks. And last month, China’s disciplinary body announced that dozens of officials were punished for failure to prevent the outbreak in the city. China reported a further 175 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, including five in Henan province and eight more in a separate cluster linked to a garment factory in the eastern city of Ningbo. Officials did not say what variant the outbreak involved. Although the reported cases are low compared with elsewhere in the world, new coronavirus infections in recent weeks have reached a high not seen in the country since March 2020.

447;447;5694;5694;Can London stock market shake off dinosaur image to boldly go?;2022-01-04T08:10:40Z;['Graeme Wearden'];['Stock markets', 'London Stock Exchange', 'London', 'UK news', 'IPOs', 'Business', 'FTSE'];"London’s stock market is facing a barrage of criticism, with global investors likening it to a “global backwater” struggling to attract and retain growth companies that excite investors and are building the 21st-century economy. However, after a surge of stock flotations in 2021, including cutting-edge firms such as Oxford Nanopore, and new listing rules, London’s status as a global financial centre could brighten in 2022. Currently, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies looks dated. Technology only makes up about 2% of the London market, compared with 20% across global markets. “That means London is tenfold underweight in the part of the economy growing faster, and which is attracting high valuations,” says Simon French, the chief economist of Panmure Gordon. “If you’re an investor looking to invest in growth, you haven’t got a lot of options on the UK public market, with the greatest respect to Sage and Micro Focus.”
Paul Marshall, the boss of the £40m ($55bn) hedge fund Marshall Wace, wrote in the Financial Times that the City of London risked becoming “a sort of Jurassic Park”, and that fund managers were content to collect dividends from ponderous old economy players rather than encouraging and rewarding innovation. French points out that in the US market, liquidity has doubled since the financial crisis, but on the FTSE All-Share it has more than halved, putting some fund managers off investing in London. “Performance begets liquidity begets performance, so London’s underperformance can lead to a vicious circle,” French explains. He fears that recent reviews of the UK’s listing regime have failed to tackle this liquidity issue. James Anderson, the joint manager of Baillie Gifford’s Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust and an early investor in major US tech stocks such as Tesla, has compared the FTSE 100 to a 19th-century stock market – heavy with banks and oil stocks, but sadly lacking in real innovation. It will take time for London to shake off this image, French says. “You don’t go from a 19th-century stock exchange, or a Jurassic Park one, to a Star Trek exchange overnight.” There are signs that London is beaming up some fast-growing companies, with Oxford Nanopore, Deliveroo and Darktrace coming to market. In total, 122 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange last year, raising more than £16.8bn – the biggest initial public offering pot since 2007. But the journey has been shaky: Deliveroo tumbled by 30% on its debut in March, and is languishing at record lows, while Darktrace was ejected from the FTSE 100 after its initial share surge faded. Others have done better, such as the consumer review site Trustpilot, which has gained 25% since floating. “For every Deliveroo or Darktrace, there is a Trustpilot or Auction Technologies out there,” says French. High valuations on the other side of the Atlantic also hurt London – they mean firms don’t have to sell as much of their company on the Nasdaq, tor example, to raise the same money. London’s new listing rules mean private firms needn’t sell as much stock to go public. They also allow firms with dual-class share structures popular with entrepreneurs and founders on to the FTSE 100 and the 250 index of smaller firms. Marshall, though, says London needs to move “faster and harder still” to lure growth companies, close the gap with New York and become a more attractive place to list and raise capital than the EU and Asia. “London is also the natural home for ESG [environmental, social and governance] winners, emerging market winners and digital assets. To capitalise on these advantages, we need to encourage asset managers to invest in these assets and develop a wider culture of growth-oriented investing,” he insists. The move towards ESG investing had counted against London, with fund managers shunning polluting industries such as fossil fuel producers and mining companies. London’s problem in 2021 was retaining companies as much as attracting new ones. A string of listed companies became takeover targets,, such as the defence firm Meggitt and UK tech firm Blue Prism, with speculation BT could be next. The weaker pound also left some growth companies as sitting ducks – chip designer ARM, the crown jewel of UK tech, was snaffled by SoftBank just after the Brexit vote in 2016.
US private equity firms have also taken advantage of depressed valuations. This hoovering up of British tech firms by US investors is worrying MPs, with 130 UK tech firms reportedly acquired by American companies between January and mid-December 2021. “We need to recognise the impact this is having on our own capabilities and sovereign strength,” Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the parliamentary defence select committee, told the Daily Telegraph. “It goes against the grain of the government’s wise long-term ambition of becoming a high-tech superpower.” David Miller, an executive director of Quilter Cheviot, pushes back on the idea that the City of London itself risks becoming a backwater. “In many ways it remains an ideal location for investment managers, with its time zone, language, huge infrastructure and the right attitude. London has always been good at global investment, it’s always looked out, not in, and that makes London the best place for global investment,” says Miller. The UK broker AJ Bell estimates that the FTSE 100 will pay out £81.8bn in dividends in 2021, a 32% increase compared with 2020 when the pandemic forced firms to cut or suspend payments. The mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP Group, oil firm Shell and tobacco company BAT will dole out the most, highlighting the City’s dilemma – owning these “sin stocks” can generate a healthy income, vital for pension funds and income funds. Miller can’t see a world in which a balanced portfolio doesn’t have dividend payers as part of the mix; not paying a dividend shouldn’t see a company excluded if its prospects are good. The balance between growth and value stocks today is different than before the dotcom crash two decades ago. “In 1999, people sold dividend-paying firms to buy firms that just evaporated,” Miller says. There’s also a different mindset to investing across the Atlantic. “Investors in the US want the companies they invest in to grow market share – market share really excites US fund managers,” Miller says. In the UK and Europe there’s much more focus on profitability. “If a company isn’t profitable now, we want to know when it will be profitable.” In the short term, the FTSE 100 could benefit if the pandemic eases in 2022, lifting banks, mining firms, oil companies, travel and hospitality firms. JPMorgan recently upgraded its rating on UK stocks to “overweight”, pointing out that British equity markets are now trading at a “record discount”. Matt Weller, the global head of research at Forex.com and City Index, agrees that much of the FTSE’s underperformance comes down to sector weightings. “The FTSE’s heavy allocation to the underperforming consumer staple and financial sectors (both near 20% weighting) dwarf the index’s minuscule (under 2%) exposure to technology stocks, exactly the inverse of the allocation that you’d create with the benefit of hindsight,” says Weller. “Of course, markets are highly cyclical, and the recent uptick in inflation and interest rates could be the catalyst to shift sector performance in favor of the FTSE’s weights in the coming quarters.” London has also lost out to Amsterdam in the race to attract “blank-cheque” companies, big on Wall Street, which seek out a fledgling business to acquire. London’s first special purpose acquisition company (Spac) launched at the end of November, by which time Amsterdam had already racked up 13. In the long run, local exchanges could be pushed further to the margins. 24 Exchange, a Bermuda-based crypto and foreign exchange trading platform, is planning to bring in around-the-clock stock trading, which is already possible with cryptocurrencies. Miller says the general idea of 24-hour trading is not a “totally ridiculous” one. “The transition from floor trading to where we are now isn’t going to stop where it is now.” To an extent there is already 24-hour trading through the working week, with bourses in Asia-Pacific markets, Europe and New York together covering most time zones. But many stocks are only listed on one exchange, and liquidity in individual companies is better when their local exchange is open. Non-stop trading could be gruelling for equities traders, although nothing that other industries don’t handle. “If the car industry can work on three shifts per day, why can’t traders?” Miller points out.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/can-london-stock-market-shake-off-dinosaur-image-to-boldly-go;5
448;448;5695;5695;‘Elton John listening to us blows my mind’: Yard Act on humour, despair and celebrity fans;2022-01-04T08:00:10Z;['Stevie Chick'];['Music', 'Pop and rock', 'Elton John', 'Culture'];"There are few couplets in pop that capture modern life’s seesaw between cynicism and hope as well as this choice gem near the end of The Overload, the forthcoming debut album from Leeds group Yard Act: “It’s all so pointless / Ah, but it’s not though, is it?” The line bares the soft underbelly of a band whose bleakly hilarious post-punk clatter channels the interior monologues of some of the country’s very worst bigots and bores, before finding unexpected humanity within them. A band who have won comparison to such caustic mavericks as Fontaines DC and Sleaford Mods, at the same time as finding themselves unlikely residents of the Radio 1 playlist and the record collection of one Elton John, who declared himself a fan in a Guardian interview. “I’m an optimist,” insists James Smith, Yard Act’s gangly, garrulous frontman, Zooming from his Leeds bedroom and fussing with his mop of mousey hair. He knows a perverse variant of luck is on his side right now. Yard Act were a late-career roll of the dice after his previous band of nine years, Post War Glamour Girls, splintered. Then, almost as soon as Yard Act formed, Covid surfaced and venues shuttered. Still they have thrived against all odds.
Smith’s prospects weren’t always so sunny. Growing up in Lymm, near Warrington, he was a South Park-obsessed budding animator whose dreams were scotched by art teachers with whom he had “disagreements”. But as that door closed, his next youthful obsession, Gorillaz, opened Smith’s ears to pop and set him on a wayward path that took in his dad’s hip-hop records, the early 21st-century indie renaissance of the Strokes, LCD Soundsystem and Arctic Monkeys, and the poetic growling of Tom Waits. “My world was small,” he remembers. “My ambition was to move to Leeds. I wanted to start a band, and there weren’t enough people in my town who understood what I wanted to do.” He arrived in Leeds aged 18, and found his home in the city’s “nurturing, insular DIY scene”, making friends with the other local bands and never dreaming much further than its city limits. “Most bands in Leeds aren’t bothered about breaking out, or don’t know how to,” Smith says. Post War Glamour Girls were a little of both: “We didn’t connect, for whatever reason. I was in a dark, miserable place, as most men in their early 20s are when they face life head-on and realise it’s not as fun as they thought it was gonna be.”
Smith spent his days teaching music and as a support worker for “a lad with a brain injury and cerebral palsy, who I worked with for nine years and is one of my best friends”. His evenings, meanwhile, involved post-work pints with friend Ryan Needham, the bassist in another Leeds band, Menace Beach. The pair bonded over music and more – “I just found him so funny, and I wanted to be around him all the time because he made me laugh so much,” Smith says – and when Needham became briefly homeless, Smith offered his spare room. “My wife was very accommodating and let me play music with my friend for three months and ignore her,” he grins. It wasn’t time wasted. Smith and Needham formed Yard Act in the image of US lo-fi indie rock greats Guided By Voices. “We were just gonna get drunk, write pop songs, record them on cassettes and give ’em to friends,” Smith remembers. “But Ryan started leaning towards no wave, dance-punk basslines, and encouraged me to explore the style I’ve ended up writing in now.” That style was a spoken-word post-punk hybrid, heavy on narrative. “It’s rap music, but it’s not rap music,” he explains. “A lot of rap is first-person statements and defining who you are. My approach was conversational, and humorous. You’re putting yourself out there when you start cracking jokes. It’s a lot more nerve-racking than being po-faced and mysterious. But mystique’s never been my strong point.” Smith’s new style crystallised on Fixer Upper, Yard Act’s debut seven-inch, self-released in July 2020. An exercise in blackly comedic character observation worthy of Steve Coogan, the track showcased Smith’s new creation Graeme, a charmless, overbearing self-made man with a sideline in low-grade bigotry. “I’ve become quite defensive over Graeme,” Smith says, adding that for many of Yard Act’s nascent fanbase Graeme was “the embodiment of everything they hate. But he’s just a bit of an idiot, really, with a lot of half-formed opinions he thinks are gospel. He’s an amalgamation of friends’ dads and men in the pub when I was growing up; they’re rife in small towns. Ultimately, if we can’t figure out how to coexist with the Graemes of the world, we’re not going to get anywhere.”
Smith says that with Yard Act he has struck a balance “between the anger and the mellowness that make me up”. That anger grew, he says “post-Brexit referendum”, as he felt “the world get harder and harder”. Perhaps trying to find the good in Graeme is his attempt to make peace with this anger? “The state of this country, and the world, can quickly get you into a spiral of Everything Is Bad,” he nods. “But it’s not. The good moments don’t exist without the bleak shit. We can’t eradicate misery and depression, we’ve got to coexist with it. “Lately, I’ve been watching series after series of First Dates,” he continues. “People just want to find someone to love and to listen to them. Even the Graemes of the world, even the nasty bastards. And no one’s fully formed, people can change. There’s that Bill Callahan song, I’m New Here, where he says: ‘No matter how far wrong you’ve gone, you can always turn around.’ I try and apply that to everyone I meet.” He pauses. “Of course, if you’re really fucked off with someone, it’s fine to think they’re absolutely shit as well.” Focusing on the good stuff is his medicine now, and there’s plenty for Smith to be positive about: parenthood, imminent pop stardom of some stripe and the patronage of a celebrity fan. “Maybe Elton could give Bernie Taupin a few weeks off, and I’ll send him some of my stories for his next record, and see if he can make them cinematic,” Smith grins. “Elton John, eating his breakfast, listening to Yard Act … It blows my mind, I can’t lie.” The Overload is out on 21 January on Island Records/Zen FC.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/04/elton-john-listening-to-us-blows-my-mind-yard-act-on-humour-despair-and-celebrity-fans;7
449;449;5696;5696;‘Seems like a scam’: Americans with diabetes criticize Biden’s insulin proposal;2022-01-04T08:00:10Z;['Michael Sainato'];['US healthcare', 'Diabetes', 'US news'];"Samia Chowdhury of Ontario, California, saw her work hours in the restaurant industry dwindle from full-time to less than 10 hours a week when Covid shutdowns began in the US in March 2020. But the loss of work was not her only problem. As a someone who has had type 1 diabetes since she was 12, Chowdhury could not afford health insurance after losing most of her work hours and couldn’t get on Medicaid through California. Instead, she relied on visiting medical clinics for insulin prescription refills when she could afford to do so and mutual aid from other people with diabetes around the US.
“I could barely scrape together the $35 for the visit,” said Chowdhury. “I could not make ends meet. I was essentially choosing either a roof over my head or my health insurance.” She relied on the clinics for doctor visits, lab work, and had to ration insulin and supplies while struggling to make ends meet with rent and other bills. “Because I have to take the quick-acting insulin more often when I eat, that would be the only prescription I would pick up. The only way I can describe the effects on someone’s body is it feels like your whole body is acidic, but at least you’re getting to tomorrow,” she added. “I was making a vial last for up to two months.” She also had to go without other supplies, such as testing strips, and reused syringes until they became too dull to use any more. From rationing insulin during the pandemic, to previous periods in her life when she didn’t have access to insulin, Chowdhury has experienced significant side effects such as kidney issues and eye issues. In October, Chowdhury was able to afford health insurance again after getting a new job, but still pays co-pays for doctor visits and prescriptions and is working to recover from the credit card debt she accrued while trying to get by through the rest of the pandemic. As part of the Biden administration’s Build Back Better plan the co-pay for insulin would be capped at $35 for individuals who have health insurance. But the legislation is currently in a perilous limbo in Congress and under serious threat after being blocked by centrist Democrat Joe Mancin. Even if it survives Manchin’s opposition, or emerges in a different form, those who depend on insulin say it may not help them enough. People with type 1 diabetes, who cannot produce any insulin and require it to survive, have criticized the proposal and messaging around it, citing the insurance cap includes loopholes, does not impact individuals who do not have health insurance coverage in the US, and doesn’t address the issue of US pharmaceutical companies price gouging the sales price of insulin, while people in other industrialized nations are charged a fraction of US prices. “It just seems like a big scam for the private insurance companies,” said Ginni Correa, a 27-year-old with type 1 diabetes in Jacksonville, Florida. “Our lives are being used for propaganda. Wording is very important. Because when you tell the general public that you’re capping the price of insulin, that’s deceitful because millions of Americans aren’t insured and the majority of diabetics who are insured, they still can’t afford the cost and it’s going to go to the premiums.” Correa has frequently been forced to ration insulin or insulin supplies since she turned 18 and aged out of a state health plan when she went away to college. It’s a constant worry she has to take into account because of health insurance tied to her employment, and the out of pocket costs even with insurance, from deductibles to co-pays for doctor visits, labs, insulin and insulin supplies, and figuring out what insurance companies will cover. “These are things that aren’t addressed when it comes to the Build Back Better plan and the $35 co-pay cap, because even if you are fortunate enough to have insurance at the time, insurance isn’t something that’s necessarily stable in this country,” she said. According to the CDC, 34.2 million Americans, more than one out of every 10 Americans, has diabetes, with Native Americans, Hispanic and Black people disproportionately affected and less likely to be covered by health insurance. 1.4 million US adults aged 20 or older reported having type 1 diabetes and using insulin, in addition to 187,000 adolescents and children under 20 who have type 1 diabetes. This number is projected to grow to 5 million Americans by 2050. Individuals with type 1 diabetes require several daily doses of insulin, while those with type 2 require varying dosages, as these individuals are able to produce insulin but cannot rely on it to control their blood sugar levels. One in four people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes have rationed insulin due to high costs in the US, and according to an American Diabetes Association survey, nearly one-third of people with diabetes have skipped doctor appointments or paying bills in order to afford insulin. Americans with diabetes are faced with 2.3 times greater healthcare costs. American adults and children with type 1 diabetes spend an out of pocket average of $2,500 annually for healthcare, ranging from high costs of insulin to expensive supplies such as insulin pumps, syringes, and glucose monitors. It’s the most expensive chronic disease in the US. The price of insulin in the US has soared over the past several decades, and far exceeds costs for the same type of insulin in other countries. One vial of Humalog insulin produced by Eli Lilly was priced at $21 in 1999; by 2019 it cost $332, over a 1,000% increase. The average list price of one unit of insulin in the US is $98.70, compared to $12 in Canada and $7.52 in the UK. The US consists of about 15% of the global insulin market, but accounts for nearly half of the pharmaceutical industry’s insulin revenue. These high costs persist despite the founders of insulin selling the patent for $1 in 1923 because they viewed it as unethical to profit from a lifesaving drug. Today in the US, three pharmaceutical companies, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi-Aventis and Eli Lilly control most of the insulin market. “They’re not actually going after the list price with the pharmaceutical companies. So the rest of that money has to come from somewhere,” said Mindi Patterson of Dayton, Ohio. “It only takes one illness, one car accident, to put people in a position where they have to pay completely out of pocket.” Her two sons and husband have type 1 diabetes. On Christmas Day in 2018, her family lost her husband’s sister, Meaghan Carter, 47, who passed away due to ketoacidosis which occurred due to rationing insulin through a six-month period where she was in between jobs. During the Covid pandemic, Patterson’s family has struggled to afford the medical costs associated with diabetes and her husband’s disability, which worsened as his hip replacement surgery was delayed for months, while they were fighting with their health insurance company to try to get coverage for the proper wheelchair her husband needs. She caught Covid in December 2021 while awaiting surgery to repair a torn meniscus she incurred while working and fought for weeks to process and start receiving short-term disability payments. “I’m getting half of what my paycheck normally is through short-term disability and almost all of that is going toward medication for my family and supplies. I don’t have an extra $200 or more lying around that I can pay for insurance each month,” added Patterson, who noted the insulin co-pay cap would have a minimal impact on her family’s healthcare costs. “It’s a band aid on an open, majorly gushing wound. It’s not enough.” • This article was amended on 4 January 2022 to change references to diabetes that did not adhere to Guardian style guidelines.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/insulin-copay-biden-build-back-better;1
450;450;5697;5697;Sydney festival boycott: more than 20 acts withdraw over Israeli funding;2022-01-04T08:00:07Z;['Kelly Burke'];['Sydney festival 2022', 'Australia news', 'Israel', 'Culture', 'Middle East and north Africa'];"More than 20 acts have pulled out of the 2022 Sydney festival, just 48 hours before opening night, boycotting the festival over a sponsorship deal with the Israeli embassy. The comedian Tom Ballard, the Belvoir theatre production of Black Brass, former NSW politician Meredith Burgmann, First Nations dance company Marrugeku and commentator Yumi Stynes are just some of the festival participants who have either cancelled or distanced themselves in protest, joining a growing number of Arab, pro-Palestinian, First Nations and Greens groups spearheading the call for a boycott. A number of festival events including Marrugeku’s Jurrungu Ngan-ga, the acclaimed play Seven Methods of Killing Kylie Jenner and an installation of the Wiradjuri visual artist Karla Dickens’ work Return to Sender are still going ahead, but in an independent capacity, having withdrawn from the Sydney festival banner.
The Belvoir St Theatre production of Black Brass is also still going ahead but has opted not to receive its previously agreed funding from the festival. In a statement posted to social media on Tuesday, Belvoir said it had a “long and fruitful relationship” with the Sydney festival. “Black Brass was made by and with the many African communities in Perth,” the post said. “At the heart of the process was a commitment to cultural safety which gives artists the freedom to work without fear or compromise. “In recognition that the community is now divided and Palestinian artists are unable to participate in this year’s Sydney Festival with the same cultural safety that was so essential to the making of Black Brass, we are choosing not to accept any direct financial support from the Festival.” On Tuesday the Sydney festival board put out a second statement, backing its controversial decision to forge ahead with a Sydney Dance Company production of Decadance, a work created by the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin and Tel Aviv’s Batsheva Dance Company, whose Sydney festival participation is being funded by a $20,000 grant from the Embassy of Israel in Canberra.
The board’s latest statement acknowledged the mounting calls for artists and audiences to boycott the festival, a movement which began in late December. “The Sydney Festival Board wishes collectively to affirm its respect for the right of all groups to protest and raise concerns,” the statement said. “We spent time with a number of groups who have concerns about this funding and welcomed the opportunity to engage with them. All funding agreements for the current Festival – including for Decadance - will be honoured, and the performances will proceed. “At the same time, the Board has also determined it will review its practices in relation to funding from foreign governments or related parties.” The statement went on to say it respected the right of any artist to withdraw from the festival. “As a board we ask for respectful dialogue by all individuals and organisations when engaging with artists, especially for the personal decisions that artists make,” the statement concluded. Guardian Australia has sought comment from the board’s chairperson, David Kirk. Among the other artists and organisations withdrawing are the comedian Nazeem Hussain, visual artist Khaled Sabsabi, burlesque performer Betty Grumble, Malyangapa and Barkindji hip-hop artist Barkaa, as well as the Bankstown poetry slam, and musician Marcus Whale.
On Instagram, Melbourne band Karate Boogaloo – who have also pulled out – said the act of boycotts and divestments had a strong track record of holding governments and corporations accountable for their actions.
According to a statement released on 22 December by the Palestinian Justice Movement Sydney, the sponsorship deal was sealed in May, the same month Israeli armed forces launched a series of air attacks on Gaza, killing a number of Palestinian civilians. “Palestine advocates call on all opponents of apartheid to boycott the 2022 Sydney Festival,” that statement said. “By partnering with Israel, Sydney festival will … contribute to the normalisation of an apartheid state.” In a statement issued to the Guardian on 23 December, and reiterated on 4 January, the Israel Embassy said: “The State of Israel is proud to support and participate in this important Festival that showcases leading artists and performances from around the world. “Israel has always and will continue to promote cultural exchange and engage in cultural dialogue in numerous countries including Australia. “Culture is a bridge to coexistence, cooperation and rapprochement and should be left out of the political arena.”";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/04/sydney-festival-boycott-more-than-20-acts-withdraw-over-israeli-funding;5
451;451;5698;5698;‘I feel abandoned’: Australians waiting hours to be tested and days for their Covid results blame governments;2022-01-04T07:58:14Z;['Lane Sainty'];['Health', 'Coronavirus', 'New South Wales', 'Australia news', 'Australian politics'];"When Sydney man Scott Sumner woke up in a “full sweat” at midnight on Monday with aches and cold symptoms he thought to himself: “This is not a good sign.” It was more bad news when the Petersham resident arrived at the Summer Hill testing clinic about 8.15am on Tuesday to find a queue of cars he guessed was 3km long. Still, he joined it, and inched forward, passing the time with Netflix and hoping he might be home in time for lunch. But at 10.53am, when he was about 100 metres from the clinic, his hopes were dashed.
“They just started calling people through and saying, ‘Nope, we’re done for the day’. I was like, ‘What do you mean you’re done for the day?’” The clinic was closing at midday and they had to end the line somewhere. Sumner didn’t make the cut. By the time he spoke to Guardian Australia he was in a walk-in line at the Royal Prince Alfred hospital in Camperdown for his third attempt at being tested. “It’s pretty bad, it’s pretty frustrating,” Sumner said. His head was throbbing in the hot weather and – because he’d initially expected to stay in his car – he had not brought sunscreen. He got home six hours after he left, sick, sunburnt but, finally, tested. “I feel kind of abandoned,” he said. Throughout the pandemic, he said, “I’ve been trying to do the right thing constantly … I’m now trying to do the right thing again and it’s like, I guess I’ll just get messed around by the government all day. You feel like you’ve done so much to sacrifice already. We’ve done lockdowns, we’ve done all those things, and now it feels like they’re actively not wanting us to get tested.”
In December, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said: “We have to move from a culture of mandates to a culture of responsibility. That’s how we live with this virus into the future.” But many Australians doing their best to take personal responsibility feel they are being thwarted at every turn. Across the Christmas and New Year period, social media lit up with fury and frustration over lost hours and days as people tried and often failed to do the right thing. Australians are waiting hours to get tested, waiting days for results, and waiting who knows how long for rapid antigen tests to appear at their local store. If they can afford them, that is.
Instagram account @bondi_lines, which previously posted wait times for popular nightlife spots in the beachside suburb, has started posting testing clinic wait times, as well as advice on where people can find rapid antigen tests. Tempers are fraying. When a driver tried to cut the line at Summer Hill on Tuesday morning, two “large men” descended on the car, Sumner said. “[They] were banging on the window and saying, ‘You can’t do this’. We had all been in line for hours at that point … everyone’s frustrations were so high.” Tatiana Paipetis joined the queue at Mascot drive-through, also run by Laverty Pathology, about 7.30am on Tuesday. “I’ve said about five times I wish I had brought a book,” she told Guardian Australia in a phone interview from her car about 11am.
Her voice was muffled by the mask she wore to protect against possible infection from her teenage son, who was lying in the back seat, too ill to sit up. He had tested negative twice before Christmas and both times received exposure alerts from the walk-in 4Cyte clinic. Now he was sick again after being exposed to the virus on New Year’s Eve and Paipetis thought she better take him to the drive-through. “I’m just trying to protect him and others, because I’m pretty sure he’s got Covid,” she said.
After they had been queuing for about an hour, Paipetis watched a woman get out of the passenger seat in the car in front of her and walk away. She returned half an hour later – with McDonald’s. “I was like, ‘Oh my god, this woman went to Macca’s,” Paipetis said. “And she’s probably got Covid because she’s the passenger being driven to the testing.” Despite waiting nearly four-and-a-half hours to get tested, Paipetis and her son were among the lucky ones. She was within 20 cars of the cut-off point, where those lining up were told to go elsewhere. “They’re going to have a riot on their hands in a minute because they’re telling people they can’t be tested and they’ve been here for hours,” she said. Paipetis said she could afford to take the morning off work, to use up petrol by running the air conditioner for four hours. But what about people who can’t? “It really is about equity and access that concerns me most,” she said. “This government is clearly looking after private interests and the top end of town, and it’s really not the way we should be operating as a society.” The Omicron surge came just as private pathology providers closed testing clinics or substantially reduced hours for the festive season. Other closures were simply to cope with the immense backlog of tests. On Monday, Australian Clinical Labs shut a number of sites, stating it was necessary “due to the significant increase in testing volumes across the state”. On Tuesday, of the pathology clinic’s 31 testing sites, 19 were closed and the remaining 12 open during the morning.
All Histopath centres, bar the airport, were either running on reduced hours or closed altogether until 9 January, while several 4Cyte clinics were closed, some until 5 January and others until 10 January. All but a couple of Laverty sites closed at midday on Tuesday, while Medlab Pathology clinics were mostly completely shuttered, one open until 1pm. “There’s obviously reasons everything slowed down,” Paipetis said. “But it’s not like we couldn’t logistically plan for this.” And the wait doesn’t end when people finally get swabbed. Balmain man Dean Morelli received a positive test result 126 hours after he was tested – a period of more than five days. “By the time [NSW Health] got that information and it was published as a daily statistic, I’d substantially recovered from Covid,” he said. “The state government is hostage to the quality of the data being presented. If the data is inaccurate, it begs the question, what’s the quality of the decision-making process? “In fairness, I fully appreciate the fact they were totally inundated. But someone’s got to take responsibility somewhere for this situation.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/i-feel-abandoned-australians-waiting-hours-to-be-tested-and-days-for-their-results-blame-governments;7
452;452;5699;5699;Dank, ancient and quite fantastic: Scotland’s peat bogs breathe again;2022-01-04T07:30:09Z;['Phoebe Weston'];['Scotland', 'Conservation', 'Greenhouse gas emissions', 'Biodiversity', 'Environment', 'Soil', 'Rural affairs', 'Wildlife', 'Insects', 'Wild flowers'];"Flanders Moss bog is slumped on the flat, farmed landscape of the Carse of Stirling in Scotland like a jelly fungi. It wobbles when you walk on it, and a metal pole goes down eight metres before reaching hard ground. This lowland-raised bog is a dome of peat fed mainly by rainfall and it acts like a single organism – the whole thing has to be looked after for any part to be in really good shape. If it is drained in one area it will affect the water level across the entire bog. For much of human history peat bogs have been thought of as wastelands. This 860-hectare (2,125-acre) site has been hacked away and drained since the early 1800s to make space for fertile farmland below. It is about 60% of its original size. Bogs scar easily and the drainage ditches made more than 100 years ago are still visible.
It is now recognised that peat bogs are among the greatest stores of carbon and, after decades of restoration, the holes in the peat at Flanders Moss have been patched up. Areas that used to be purple with heather are turning green as key bog plants such as sphagnum (peat moss) and cottongrass come back. The bog rises out of the land like a sponge and “breathes” as changes in the weather and water level cause it to swell and contract. Researchers in Scotland are tracking “bog breathing” using the latest satellite technology that can detect just a few millimetres of change. This provides an accurate test of how healthy the site is and how much carbon it could be holding. Flanders Moss holds around 3m tonnes of carbon. Thanks to the restoration work, the water table has risen by as much as 40cm on the site and is now at the surface. As the bog draws in water from the surrounding land it helps manage flood risk. Flanders Moss bog has removed 890 hectares of land from the Forth catchment, reducing flooding downstream. A healthy bog is a bit like a malfunctioning compost heap. “With a compost heap we keep throwing stuff in and it all rots and breaks down, but with a bog, it doesn’t. It just keeps accumulating and accumulating,” says David Pickett, who manages the site, which is a National Nature Reserve.
The Scottish government-funded Peatland Action project, which started in 2012, is helping revive 25,000 hectares of degraded peatland. In 2020, the Scottish government committed £250m of funding over 10 years to bog restoration in a bid to lock carbon in the land. It is hoped the satellite data can be used to work out which bogs need urgent help and what efforts are working.
“At some point, hopefully, we’ll be able to inform government, but also private investors and other funding bodies, to say ‘well, it’s better to put your money into these sites’,” says Henk Pieter Sterk, who is working on the Peatland Action project at NatureScot. “Here in Scotland, we have the opportunity to protect and restore peatlands … It’s the easiest thing you can do. Restoring peatlands is a no-brainer.” It takes about a month to process the satellite data for a third of Scotland, which is available through the Copernicus Open Access Hub. The technology is still in development but is likely to be cheaper than ground-based mapping. “The next steps would include looking at an even wider range of peatland types and conditions across Scotland, followed by – hopefully – an assessment of the tool across the UK for the same purpose,” says Sterk. Despite these restoration efforts, Flanders Moss is still a net emitter of carbon. Scotland’s bogs emit about 10m tonnes of carbon equivalent, which is almost as much as the transport sector. Stopping these emissions and preventing further degradation are the primary objectives of the restoration project.
Bogs work on a different timeframe than humans. They form slowly, accumulating between 0.5mm to 1mm of peat a year, taking up to 1,000 years to grow one metre. But Pickett’s team has jump-started recovery. “We’ve done most of the big work here,” he says. “Now, it’s a question of waiting. The process of fixing this site will last 100 years, and the benefits of work being done now will only be seen by the next generation.” It’s easy to see why bogs weren’t popular. They are stores of partly decayed organic matter, which are too acidic and devoid of nutrients to support healthy trees. But this bog is colourful and has a fresh, earthy smell. As well as being a fantastic store of carbon, this ancient, watery land – healthy peat is about 90% water – is also rich in wildlife, including rare lizards, dragonflies and even snakes. “There isn’t headline sexy stuff like puffins and seals but you go around the boardwalk and it’s a fantastic place,” says Pickett. “I always used to think bogs must have been named on a Friday after a really bad week. We’re trying to change the perception of bogs but it’s a hard sell.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/04/dank-ancient-and-quite-fantastic-scotland-peat-bogs-breathe-again-aoe;3
453;453;5700;5700;Missing in action: this season’s most overlooked movie performances;2022-01-04T07:26:09Z;['Guy Lodge'];['Film', 'Oscars', 'Awards and prizes', 'Culture', 'Rebecca Hall', 'Bradley Cooper'];"With the most recent Oscar ceremony having taken place abnormally late in April, it feels like we barely had a break before the machinery of awards season started cranking up again. It began at the Venice film festival at the tail end of summer and is now in full cry, with major critics’ groups and more dubious collectives like the Golden Globes having already weighed in – and a gaggle of apparent frontrunners establishing themselves in major categories. In the acting fields, we’re already pondering the likelihood of victories for stars like Kristen Stewart, Benedict Cumberbatch, Will Smith and Rita Moreno – though there’s still plenty of wiggle room for surprises. Last year’s extra-long season yielded an almost entirely unforeseen nomination for Lakeith Stanfield and an against-the-odds win for Anthony Hopkins: never make the mistake of taking the pundits’ word as gospel.
With that in mind, we’re highlighting a few outlying performances that ought to be in the mix, but haven’t yet generated the buzz they deserve. Some of them are just outside the perceived top tier of contenders, others are long shots that we can merely dream about. But there’s still a long way to go – Oscar nomination ballots only go out toward the end of January, for one thing. And the season would be more interesting for having all these names invited to the party. Richard Ayoade, The Souvenir Part II
Two years ago, Ayoade’s brief, haughty cameo was a comic high point of The Souvenir, the first part of Joanna Hogg’s quietly momentous, autobiographical portrait of the artist as a young woman. His expanded presence in the second is one of the film’s great surprises: the character enters proceedings as a hilariously preening, self-involved film-maker on the rise (allegedly inspired by Julien Temple) before delivering an unexpectedly bittersweet shot of wisdom in his final scene. He lost the British Independent Film award to After Love newcomer Talid Ariss, and given the first film’s failure to register with Bafta and the Academy, that might have been his best shot on goal. Bradley Cooper, Nightmare Alley and Licorice Pizza
Bradley Cooper has been nominated for eight Oscars, four of them for acting, and has yet to win: last time, he suffered the humiliation of putting his heart, soul and real singing voice into portraying a doomed rock star in A Star is Born, only to lose to Rami Malek’s lip-synching, rubber-dentured Freddie Mercury. You’d think he’s carrying a pretty hefty IOU into this year’s race, but so far neither of his two superb, very different performances in high-profile prestige films have generated much heat. He’s unnerving as a fraudulent, tar-souled mentalist in Guillermo del Toro’s sleek noir remake, and a blast of gonzo comic energy as flamboyant producer Jon Peters in Paul Thomas Anderson’s California nostalgia piece: perhaps voters will eventually latch on to the bravura range he’s showing. Matt Damon, Stillwater
After some gauche interview statements, Matt Damon’s popularity isn’t at a high right now, and barely anyone saw Tom McCarthy’s Amanda Knox-inspired fish-out-of-water water drama when it hit cinemas in the summer – extinguishing whatever awards hopes remained after its tepid Cannes premiere. That’s a shame, since he’s genuinely terrific in it: cast against type as a Trump-supporting Oklahoma oil worker attempting to defy the French legal system after his daughter’s murder conviction, he’s both calloused and wounded, resisting cheap political stereotyping, but not also shying from the bluster of ugly-American entitlement. He’s been nominated for far less substantial work. Anders Danielsen Lie, The Worst Person in the World
Renate Reinsve, the luminous lead of Norwegian director Joachim Trier’s generational dramedy, has deservedly led the film’s awards charge since winning best actress at Cannes in July, and recently placed second with the LA film critics. But Danielsen Lie, who’s having a banner year between this and Bergman Island, deserves some of the hype too: as the older Gen X boyfriend of Reinsve’s restless millennial protagonist, he’s a wry anchoring presence in the film’s early stages, before stepping up to carry the film’s most devastating strand – including a punch-to-the-gut monologue confessing his fears of being erased by the future. He deserves more recognition, not that the actor – who still maintains a second career as a doctor – seems especially bothered. Ana de Armas, No Time to Die
The latest, bleakest James Bond adventure divided popular opinion in most of the usual ways, but there was one component of the film that everyone agreed on as a highlight: Ana de Armas’s funny, thrilling, one-and-done action sequence as an inexperienced Cuban CIA agent drafted in to help the ex-007 out on a delicate Havana mission, that she then proceeds to blow up in absolutely every sense of the term. Many complained that her presence was too brief, but it’s an ideal Bond cameo: she waltzes in with all guns blazing and charisma to spare, sets everything on fire, and leaves you wanting more. Can you name a supporting actress contender this year who does more in less time to juice up her film? Dagmara Domińczyk, The Lost Daughter
Maggie Gyllenhaal’s marvellous directorial debut is rightly racking up awards buzz for Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley as different but eerily synched iterations of the same character, with the latter hoping to score in the supporting category. I hope she does, but her meatier role gives her a leg-up on her fine co-stars, who also merit consideration: Dakota Johnson for one, but especially the excellent, oft-sidelined Polish American actor Domińczyk, who burns an immediate hole in proceedings as the watchful, passive-aggressive holidaymaker who first locks horns with Colman’s equally thorny tourist. Radiating volatile don’t-tread-on-me energy beneath even a polite offer of birthday cake, she lingers faintly terrifyingly in the mind long after her character recedes into the background. Colman Domingo, Zola
The malevolent secret weapon of Janicza Bravo’s raucous, ripped-from-Twitter stripper romp, Domingo hasn’t been entirely ignored so far this season, having collected supporting nods from both the indie-oriented Gotham and Spirit awards. But it’s looking all too likely that he’ll be crowded out of the Oscar race by bigger names in slicker, softer films, and that isn’t right. As the mysterious, initially nameless Nigerian pimp who comes to hold Taylour Paige and Riley Keough’s road-tripping dancers in his ruthless grip, he’s a lightning bolt in an already sparky enterprise, code-switching with uncanny aplomb and controlling the very tone of the film on a dime. Polly Draper, Shiva Baby
Emma Seligman’s brilliant, claustrophobic comedy of manners, errors and bagels has one of the year’s most beautifully cast, balanced and rhythmically integrated ensembles – and it’s been a shame to see that go unrecognised by voting groups who reserve ensemble awards for films cramming the most A-list names on to the screen. But if there’s any MVP in the closely matched group (and I very nearly plumped for Dianna Agron’s sweetly venomous shiksa at the all-Jewish wake), it’s Draper’s invasive, fretful, maddeningly neurotic but movingly concerned mother to Rachel Sennott’s spiralling protagonist – a walking Jewish mother joke whose punchline turns out to be her very human tenderness. Rebecca Hall, The Night House
When this excellent, underrated psychological horror film was released in August, I wasn’t the only critic to note that Hall unassumingly gives one of the year’s best performances in it: a study in politely suppressed grief erupting as increasingly off-kilter mania. Of course, it was agreed at the time, this modest genre indie wasn’t the kind of film that would return at awards season; good thing her superb directorial debut Passing would get her some behind-the-camera gold instead. Five months later, Passing also is getting less than its due in precursor awards, and one way or another, Hall deserves better for the standout year of her career. Gaby Hoffmann, C’mon C’mon
When I first saw C’mon C’mon, I assumed Hoffmann would be among the top tier of women to beat for all best supporting actress prizes. A well-loved child star turned valued character actor in TV and film alike, she does the best work of her career in Mike Mills’s lovely, melancholic study of parenting, guardianship and the burden of care. As the weary but enduringly patient sister of Joaquin Phoenix’s protagonist, straining under the weight of responsibilities to her son and husband alike, Hoffmann exquisitely essays the emotional exhaustion that is a symptom of the age we live in, playing her neither as sainted martyr or frazzled harridan, but something credibly in between. It’s delicate, precise work, and evidently too subtle by half – even the Spirit awards, otherwise high on Mills’s film, failed to nominate her. Toko Miura, Drive My Car
Japanese director Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s rich, finely woven three-hour adaptation of a Haruki Murakami short story has emerged as the unexpected darling of critics’ award season, even uniting the rarely simpatico New York and Los Angeles critics’ groups in their best picture voting. Leading man Hidetoshi Nishijima has received some best actor attention along the way, but Miura, his most essential scene partner for the bulk of the film, has been largely ignored. As the young, taciturn chauffeur to Nishijima’s withdraw stage maestro, gradually revealing a life of inordinate tragedy in economical phrases and gestures, she’s as compelling a listener on screen as she is a speaker, and deserves her share of the glory. Charlotte Rampling, Benedetta
It’s been a good year for Rampling, who wouldn’t be a bad shout in best supporting actress for her darkly imperious Gaius Helen Mohiam in Denis Villeneuve’s spectacular take on Dune. But that isn’t the first, nor the best, Reverend Mother figure she’s played this year: she’s a riot in Paul Verhoeven’s lurid nuns-gone-wild spectacular, playing a progressively undermined authoritarian figure who pivots from gorgon to strangely sympathetic victim almost entirely on the strength of Rampling’s austere, stricken gravitas. But she’s blissfully attuned to the high camp of the enterprise too, reeling off some of the year’s most impeccably withering one-liners: “No miracles happen in bed,” she says at one point with pitch-perfect, life-learned disdain. Charlie Shotwell, John and the Hole
In a good year for child performances, two boys are hogging the attention: Woody Norman, the furious, capricious, heart-on-sleeve British prodigy of C’mon C’mon, and Belfast lead Jude Hill, an appealing presence tackling somewhat less complex demands. Fourteen-year-old Shotwell, however, should be right up there with them. Having already proven himself an impressively eerie presence in The Nest, he carries Pascual Sisto’s chilling, Haneke-esque riff of Home Alone with unnerving assurance and vivid psychic pain – as a meek teenage boy trapping and imprisoning his family in order to live independently. It’s an unnerving premise, enriched by Shotwell’s refusal to play John merely as a dead-eyed boy-psycho: he’s a kid, curious and vulnerable, stretching for an epiphany that eludes him. Dan Stevens, I’m Your Man
That Dan Stevens, erstwhile toff dreamboat of Downton Abbey, speaks German throughout Maria Schrader’s delightful sci-fi romcom is the most immediately surprising aspect of a performance that nonetheless goes on to wrong-foot and disorient us in more substantial ways. As a bespoke android boyfriend perfectly tailored for the needs of Maren Eggert’s wary career woman, he has fun luring us into the character’s robotic implacability before inviting us to question whether his sentience and emotional weak spots are themselves programmed, or a kind of human ghost in the machine. It’s one of the year’s most spry comic turns, and the high point of a career that has recently taken quirkier directions than anyone might have guessed after his TV breakout. Mary Twala, This is Not a Burial, It’s a Resurrection
A legend in her native South Africa, the 80-year-old Twala died in 2020, mere months after her career-crowning turn in Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese’s staggering Lesotho-set fable first popped at the Sundance film festival. That may add a degree of poignancy to her performance as a rural widow whose preparations to die are disrupted by a battle for her ancestral land, but it needs no sentimental context: it’s already devastating work on its own terms, carrying a lifetime of labour and marginalisation in her gnarled but defiant bearing and expression. She stands her ground as though she’s grown roots in the earth itself.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/04/overlooked-movie-performances-awards-season;5
454;454;5701;5701;Tim: The Official Biography of Avicii by Måns Mosesson review – private struggles of the EDM poster boy;2022-01-04T07:00:10Z;['Kitty Empire'];['Biography books', 'Avicii', 'Dance music', 'Music', 'Books', 'Culture'];"Tim Bergling – the Swedish DJ and producer known as Avicii – killed himself in Muscat, Oman, in April 2018 at the age of 28. The very worst happened when things were apparently looking up. The successful but troubled electronic dance music (EDM) star had retired from relentless touring in 2016 to focus on his wellbeing. He had weaned himself off opioids – prescribed by doctors when bouts of alcohol-induced pancreatitis led to debilitating pain and, later, surgery. He was communicating regularly with a therapist, was often surrounded by childhood friends, donated to charities. He meditated. Having crossed over from pure party music to making tracks alongside established stars such as Coldplay and Nile Rodgers, Bergling was working on new material he was excited about. A documentary about his meteoric rise and his stress levels – Avicii: True Stories – had been broadcast in 2017, seemingly with a happy ending.
When it appeared on Netflix, True Stories reverberated well beyond club culture, super-charging the existing public debate around the mental health of performers. Viewers were witness to a life unravelling, privy to alarming practices that were normalised. Stardom has always come at a high price, but in EDM, capitalising on your hot streak seemed especially urgent. Quite aside from the usual hedonism, the hours an ambitious, in-demand EDM DJ had to keep were gruelling: multiple gigs in one night, sometimes in different countries or time zones, with constant travel (especially hard for the flight-phobic Bergling) and scant basic self-care. In 2019, an anonymous book by another industry insider, The Secret DJ, went even deeper into the lunacy of the lifestyle. Tim: The Official Biography of Avicii retells Bergling’s story, adding considerable context and lashings of pain: parents Klas and Anki Bergling are major sources. Written by Swedish journalist Måns Mosesson and translated by a US academic Brad Harmon, the book’s slightly wide-eyed tone finds strait-laced grownups grappling with the extremes of youth, from World of Warcraft – an obsession of the younger Bergling – to the wild west of club culture, via the monomaniacal perfectionism of digital music-making.
The book succeeds in fleshing out Bergling, an elfin poster boy for hyper-commercial EDM who wanted to be taken seriously as an artist. Mosesson is very good on the path to fame and the wider ecosystem around Avicii. A shy, curious, stubborn youngster who feared he would get cancer, he suffered from serious acne and social anxiety, affecting his self-esteem. An interest in the esoteric led Bergling to name himself after a particularly punishing zone of Buddhist hell. He ended up in something like it. Mosesson had access to Bergling’s rehab journal and almost everyone in his life – ex-girlfriends, childhood pals, fellow superstar DJs, psychotherapists. The author was also privy to Bergling’s digital life – texts, emails and messageboard posts; a level of intimate access biographers must surely have only dreamed of until now. Bergling’s former manager, Arash Pournouri, declined to participate. After Bergling’s death, online opinion swirled around the relentless schedule over which Avicii’s management had presided. But in a recent interview, Bergling senior was specific in exonerating Pournouri, with whom his son had reconciled, and keen to examine the bigger music industry picture, beating the drum for swifter mental health interventions. There are no kneejerk conclusions here, just candour and context: pressure, both external and internal, absolutely played a role in Avicii’s unravelling, as did the US prescription opioid scandal. As the book draws to its harrowing ending, Mosesson offers up a series of factors at play in 2018. Although he had kicked virtually everything else, Bergling still smoked a lot of weed. The book discusses how insidiously – or suddenly – psychosis can affect THC users. Bergling became involved with transcendental meditation, which he credited with reducing his anxiety. But he would meditate intensely for hours, impatient to achieve enlightenment at speed. In messages to his therapist, he confided that he had become confused by what felt like a torrent of insights. At the same time, Bergling texted his mother, full of love and excitement about a move from LA back to Stockholm. In the aftermath of Bergling’s death, many of his closest associates sought help for their own issues and dependencies. The DJ’s father is especially keen that the word “suicide” be used in relation to his son; to speak plainly about what the mental health charity (Tim Bergling Foundation) set up in the DJ’s memory calls “a global health emergency”. • Tim: The Official Biography of Avicii by Måns Mosesson (translated by Brad Harmon) is published by Sphere (£20).

455;455;5702;5702;Charlotte Higgins on The Archers: is romance set to bloom for Stella and Ruth?;2022-01-04T07:00:10Z;['Charlotte Higgins'];['The Archers', 'Radio 4', 'Radio', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'BBC'];"Is Stella gay? My hopes are high. Mia, Borsetshire’s Greta Thunberg, has decided that the new manager of Home Farm would make a lovely wife for her stepfather, Will Grundy, who never sounds sexy but maybe is, given that he is a former gamekeeper. Mia opined that Stella seemed to be straight – which, knowing Mia’s powers of perception, means she is the most obvious lesbian who ever walked this Earth. What would you call your dog, if you had one, Mia asked her, brightly? The answer: Weaver. After Sigourney Weaver in Alien. I mean: come on. I would rest my case right there, but then came a touching scene between Stella and Ruth Archer, during which Stella found Ruth’s lost invoices, and coquettishly suggested a drink. I admit this does not necessarily suggest Lauren Bacall-Humphrey Bogart levels of sexual charge. Nevertheless, my partner, no great Archers listener, walked into the room at this moment, and, unprompted, declared: “This is so gay!” Seriously: I can see it. Say David Archer is killed by – well, there are so many possibilities on a farm – drowning in the slurry pit, shall we say? Then Ruth becomes a later-blooming lesbian and has a rapturous affair with Stella, thoroughly complicating the Home Farm/Brookfield inheritance nexus.
The Archers is deeply invested in the village rituals that mark the passage of the year: flower and produce show, fete, harvest supper. Winter means some over-elaborate amateur theatricals mounted by Lynda Snell: this year, it was medieval mystery plays peripatetically adapted to locations scattered through Ambridge – the annunciation in the kitchen at Brookfield, that kind of thing. One of the most peculiar things on British radio – no, in British culture altogether – must be the full Radio 4 broadcast of this production, in which the listener hears professional actors playing characters who are amateurishly playing another set of characters. So far, so The Mousetrap. But it’s much odder than that: into this cocktail are added voiceovers from Archers characters qua Archers characters (rather than mysteries characters) informing the listener whereabouts in Ambridge we are.
Then there’s the sound design, which, far from bringing us Borsetshire in December, offers us the hum of cicadas to summon up a warm night in Bethlehem. There is also a soundtrack of vaguely medieval-sounding music – presumably meant to recall the period in which the mystery plays were originally conceived. In short, it’s a splendidly odd layering of temporal, geographic and imaginative spaces for which the word “meta” completely fails to do justice. One can only pity the casual turner of the radio dial. It must be utterly impenetrable. Finally, a thought with which to end 2021: what is Hazel Woolley up to? • This article was amended on 21 January 2022 to clarify that Will Grundy is no longer a gamekeeper.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/04/charlotte-higgins-on-the-archers-is-romance-set-to-bloom-for-stella-and-ruth;5
456;456;5703;5703;If my parents give me their home, how will any future care home costs be calculated?;2022-01-04T07:00:10Z;['Virginia Wallis'];['Money', 'Property', 'Inheritance tax', 'UK news', 'Tax'];Q My parents are in their early 80s and own their home – worth about £500,000 – outright so they are mortgage free. In addition to their house they have savings, taking them over the £1m inheritance tax threshold, to maybe £1.2m. They are thinking of giving their home to me (and then moving out) in the hope of avoiding IHT by surviving seven years after making the gift. Also, they need to dispose of their property so that they can buy and move into more suitable sheltered housing, which should cost less than £100,000. I am aware that for inheritance tax purposes I will need to obtain a valuation of the property when my parents give it to me. I also know that the local council will take into consideration the value of the property they disposed of when means testing any future care home costs. At the moment my mother has no care needs and my father has a carer visit the home twice a week, which he pays for directly. This costs less than £40 a week. However, I am unsure how the local council would value the property as I am intending to keep it for at least five years before selling it. I may keep it for more than 20 years. If their property is worth £500,000 on transfer to me and I still own it when care home fees start to be paid – say in five years’ time – does the council assess the value of the property when my parents gave it away (so £500,000) or its value when fees started to be paid, which could be £650,000 (five years after the gift)? Also, is the answer different if, after five years, I sell the property for £650,000 and then a further three years later, my parents start paying care home fees and the property would now be worth £700,000? DS A Whenever your parents start paying care home costs, the council won’t care what their house is worth because their other assets put them well above the threshold at which they would qualify for financial help. People in England with total capital under £23,250 are entitled to council help in meeting care home costs but people like your parent who have capital of more – or in your parents’ case way more – than £23,250 do not get council help and have to meet the full cost themselves. Local authorities only care about people depriving themselves of assets – for example, by giving away property – when doing so has brought down an individual’s total capital to below £23,250. When that is the case, the council would take into account the value of the property at the time that it did the financial assessment. However, you are right that it would make sense to have a professional valuation of your parents’ house done when it is given to you. The valuation will also give you an acquisition cost to use when working out any capital gains tax bill if you do decide to sell the property at some point in the future. • Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

Republicans are widely expected to do well in this year’s midterm elections in November and, if they win control of the House, that would give them control to shut down the investigation that has proved politically and legally damaging to Trump and Republicans. The select committee opened its investigative efforts into the 6 January insurrection, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election win, with a flurry of subpoenas to Trump officials to expedite the evidence-gathering process. But aside from securing a cache of documents from Trump’s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, the select committee has found itself wading through molasses with Trump and other top administration aides seeking to delay the investigation by any means possible. The former US president has attempted to block the select committee at every turn, instructing aides to defy subpoenas from the outset and, most recently, launching a last-ditch appeal to the supreme court to prevent the release of the most sensitive of White House records. His aides are following Trump in lockstep as they attempt to shield themselves from the investigation, doing everything from filing frivolous lawsuits to stop the select committee obtaining call records to invoking the fifth amendment so as to not respond in depositions. The efforts amount to a cynical ploy by Republicans to run out the clock until the midterms and use the election calendar to characterize the interim report, which the bipartisan select committee hopes to issue by the summer, as a political exercise to damage the GOP.
The select committee, sources close to the investigation say, is therefore hoping for a breakthrough with the supreme court, which experts believe will ensure the panel can access the Trump White House records over the former president’s objections about executive privilege. “I think the supreme court is very unlikely to side with Trump, and part of it is the nature of executive privilege – it’s a power belonging to the President,” said Jonathan Shaub, a former DoJ office of legal counsel attorney and law professor at the University of Kentucky. “It’s hard to see how a former president could exercise constitutional power under a theory where all the constitutional powers are vested in the current president, so I think Trump is very likely to lose or the court may not take the case,” Shaub said. Members on the select committee note that several courts – the US district court and the US appeals court – have already ruled that Biden has the final say over which White House documents are subject to executive privilege, and that the panel has a legislative purpose. A victory for the select committee at the supreme court is important, members believe, not only because it would give them access to the records Trump has fought so hard to keep hidden, but because it would supercharge the inquiry with crucial momentum. The select committee got its first break when House investigators obtained from Meadows thousands of communications involving the White House, including a powerpoint detailing ways to stage a coup, and are hoping the supreme court can help to sustain their pace. “It’s pretty clear that these documents are serious documents that shed light on the president’s activities on January 6 and that may be quite damaging for Trump,” said Kate Shaw, a former Obama White House counsel and now a professor at the Cardozo School of Law. “They could make a difference to the record being compiled by the committee and thus they could give the process additional momentum,” Shaw said. “That’s probably why Trump is resisting their release as hard as he is.”
More generally, the select committee says they are unconcerned by attempts by Trump aides and political operatives to stymie the inquiry, since Democrats control Washington and the panel has an unprecedented carte blanche to upturn every inch the Trump administration. “The legislative and executive branches are completely in agreement with each other, that this material is not privileged and needs to be turned over to Congress,” said congressman Jamie Raskin, a member of the select committee. “Things have been moving much more quickly.” But the select committee acknowledges privately that they face a longer and more difficult slog with Trump aides and political operatives who are mounting legal challenges to everything from the panel’s attempts to compel production of call records and even testimony. The trouble for the select committee, regardless of Democrats’ controlling the White House, Congress and the justice department, is that they are counting on the courts to deliver accountability for Trump officials unwilling to cooperate with the inquiry. Yet Trump and his officials know that slow-moving cogs of justice have a history of doing nothing of the sort. House investigators only heard from former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn this past summer, years after the end of the special counsel investigation. The House has not even been able to obtain Trump’s tax returns – something Democrats have been fighting to get access to since they took the majority in 2018 – after repeated appeals from the former president despite repeated defeats in court. Trump and his aides insist they are not engaged in a ploy to stymie the investigation, though they admit to doing just that in private discussions, according to sources close to the former president. When the select committee issued its first subpoenas to his former aides Mark Meadows, Dan Scavino, Steve Bannon and Kash Patel, Trump’s lawyers told their lawyers to defy the orders because it would likely serve to slow down the investigation, the sources said. The result of Trump’s directive – first reported by the Guardian – is that Bannon and Meadows refused to appear for their depositions, and the select committee now may never hear their inside information about the Capitol attack after they were held in contempt of Congress. It remains possible that Bannon and Meadows seek some kind of a plea deal with federal prosecutors that involves providing testimony to the select committee in exchange for no jail time, but the court hearing for Bannon, for instance, is scheduled late into the summer. The reality for House investigators is that the cases are now in the hands of a justice department intent on proving it remains above the political fray after years of Trump’s interference at DoJ, and therefore indifferent to the time crunch felt by the 6 January committee. The situation for the select committee may be even trickier with Republican members of Congress involved in 6 January, as they just need to stonewall the investigation only through the midterms, before which the panel hopes to release an interim report into their findings. A spokesperson for the select committee declined to comment on the outlook for the investigation and their expectations for the supreme court hearing in the case against Trump, which the panel, cognizant of their limited timeframe, has asked to expedite. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, originally aimed to have the final report completed before the midterm elections, but the efforts by the most senior Trump officials to delay the investigation means he could need until the end of the year. Either way, sources close to the investigation told the Guardian, the select committee is hoping that the supreme court will deliver the elusive Trump White House records – and that it could pave the way for the investigation to shift into yet another higher gear.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/04/capitol-attack-panel-race-against-time;1
458;458;5705;5705;Here’s some good news for 2022: this could be the year the pandemic comes to an end | Raghib Ali;2022-01-04T07:00:09Z;['Raghib Ali'];['UK news', 'NHS', 'Coronavirus', 'Health', 'Infectious diseases', 'Medical research', 'Microbiology'];"As an epidemiologist and NHS consultant, 2022 begins much like 2021 did – I’m again analysing data on the impact of a new Covid variant that threatens to put huge pressure on our hospitals. And I’m back on the frontline in A&E, helping my NHS colleagues to deal with that pressure. But we are actually in a much better position, and there are good reasons to be confident that 2022 will be a much better year than 2021. Last January was perhaps the darkest time of the entire pandemic in the UK, with tens of thousands being admitted into hospital and thousands losing their lives every week. Now, with the majority of us well protected with highly effective vaccines, we have a much lower individual risk of ending up in hospital – or worse – if we catch Covid. The combination of vaccines and a better knowledge of how to treat Covid means both hospitalisation and death rates are now much lower, with the infection fatality rate having fallen by over 80%. And this means that, unlike last year, our children are going back to school this week, retail and hospitality businesses are open and we are able to meet our friends and families.
Although the NHS is again under massive pressure – particularly due to staff shortages – the early indications are that we are not facing a repeat of last winter with hospital admissions rising more slowly and ICU admissions and deaths mercifully still flat. The information from South Africa and the early data from the UK gives us a realistic hope that this wave will be over quicker than previous ones, and with much less loss of life. There are reasons to be optimistic beyond just this wave, as well. Firstly, the long-promised antiviral medicines have arrived. These new Covid treatments, which have just started being used in the UK, have the potential to transform the situation as similar medicines have done with HIV and hepatitis C. They can reduce the risk of being admitted into hospital by up to 90%, are effective against all variants, can be taken orally and are much easier to distribute than vaccines. Two are already approved but many others are currently undergoing clinical trials and should be available this year. Next, new vaccines are in development that will make it easier to manage the coronavirus variants that will inevitably emerge over the coming year. As with influenza, “multivalent” vaccines – which protect against infection from multiple variants – will probably become available later this year. Other vaccines that target parts of the virus besides the spike protein – parts that don’t mutate as easily – are also on the horizon. There are also vaccines being trialled that can be delivered by nasal spray, inhaler, orally and using skin patches – all of which will make distribution easier and overcome needle phobia.
But the immediate priority must be to ensure that our existing and very effective vaccines are distributed more equally across the globe. We have made huge progress, with 8.5bn doses delivered to date, but far too many – especially those at high risk and frontline healthcare workers in low-income countries – have not even received their first dose. Vaccinating the whole world in 2022 is a realistic prospect but this will require an end to hoarding in high-income countries and a temporary lifting of patents. And this is in our interests too – we won’t be able to prevent new variants completely but we can reduce the risk by ensuring everyone, everywhere is able to be vaccinated. Sadly Covid is not going away permanently, but we can be optimistic that 2022 will be the year the pandemic ends and it becomes an endemic disease here and in most countries thanks to the very high levels of population immunity we now have – through a combination of vaccination and natural infection. There are still likely to be seasonal winter peaks, like with flu, and an annual booster jab will probably be needed to deal with new variants and waning immunity. Like many, I have lost family, friends and colleagues. I have seen countless patients suffer from Covid – as well as from its knock-on effects on our health services – and from the lockdowns. But the huge loss of life and pain should soon be a thing of the past. We are certainly not out of the woods yet – cases are at unprecedented levels and rising (though more slowly now) and Covid is still a serious threat to the most vulnerable – so we need to continue following the public health guidance to protect them and to help reduce the pressure on the NHS so we can continue treating all our patients. But there is a realistic prospect that 2022 will be the year we can begin to live with the virus – and without the fear of both Covid and lockdowns that has haunted us for the past two years.

459;459;5706;5706;For a ray of hope in our damaged world, take a train to Epping Forest;2022-01-04T07:00:09Z;['James Gingell'];['London holidays', 'Essex holidays', 'England holidays', 'Day trips', 'Walking holidays', 'Walking', 'Environment', 'Green travel', 'Travel', 'United Kingdom holidays'];"I’m no slouch, but I’m struggling to keep up with Jeremy Dagley as he opens a gate off the A104, the main road through Epping Forest, and bounds into the woods. He is the head of conservation here and charmingly eager to show me his work. I had assumed his job would be all wellies and fleeces, clippings and handfuls of soil. The reality is he spends a lot of time indoors helping local councils with planning applications, making sure they are sustainable and sympathetic. It’s clear he’s happier out here.
Jeremy’s knowledge is immense, unspooling in tangles of “ologies”. While telling me that the chalk ridge we are walking along is a ripple caused by the formation of the Himalayas, his ears twitch towards a chirrup and he points to a podgy bundle of grey and black feathers with a bright red cap. It’s a juvenile great spotted woodpecker, says Jeremy. As he regales me with the history of the ownership of this land, I stumble into a hidden ditch; eyes drawn down, he points at a delicate yellow plant. Lousewort, he says, excitedly: it was thought extinct in these parts in the 1990s. It’s thrilling being in the company of such a master. We’re soon deep in the forest, but it’s still airy and spacious, with the low afternoon sun sending gold from the west. The trees here stand in friendly gatherings, not crowds.
Jeremy stops abruptly by an ugly, gnarled thing, and traces his hands across its snakeskin bark. Beeches normally last 300 years before they conk out and topple over. This one is 800 years old, he says, blue eyes shining. It has tickled the horses of medieval kings, survived centuries of storms, seen off war and pestilence, and remained rooted here in this soil. I feel bad for judging its wrinkles.
In fact its ugliness explains its longevity. Around head height, the snub trunk bulges in a bole, from which a handful of smaller, strong, smooth trunks reach up and branch out in subtle angles. This is the product of pollarding, trimming the tops of trees for wood, a commoner practice here for centuries. Done sparingly, it exposes dormant buds, encouraging new growth. The result is, in effect, a clutch of 200-year-old trees growing from one 800-year-old trunk. Pollarding struck me as a beautiful thing, humankind and nature gaining strength from each other. Conservation by careful use, not the lack of it. Epping Forest is home to 55,000 ancient pollards: 10,000 oak, 20,000 beech, 25,000 hornbeam. These are pollard riches unmatched in the UK, and they are only half an hour on the overground train from the City of London. During the Covid lockdowns, many Londoners realised their luck: visitor numbers increased by 300%.
As local historian Mark Gorman explains in his book Saving the People’s Forest, such easy access has not always been a given. In the mid-19th century, a new train service to Forest Gate, close to Wanstead Flats, the southernmost point of Epping Forest, brought thousands of new visitors from the East End. About the same time, the crown estate began selling the land to local aristocrats, who sniffed an opportunity to develop housing for the expanding London population. Just as the people had begun to enjoy the public land, it was being taken away. When, in 1871, Lord Cowley of Wanstead instructed agents to fence off a large section of Wanstead Flats, packed meetings agreed on a march to save the forest. On 8 July, 30,000 people assembled on the Flats, many with gorse in their lapels – a symbol of common land – and tore the fences down. Within a month, parliament passed the first of a series of acts to protect the forest. The City of London Corporation lent support, sensing a popular cause. Between 1871 and 1882, it paid £256,275 to secure conservatorship. With its help, the last of the Epping Forest Acts was passed in 1878, the first legal declaration of the right of the public at large to use an open space for leisure. It wasn’t all progress. Locals had for centuries had the right in some places to “lop” branches seven feet from the ground for use as fuel over the winter, but this was removed (in return for some compensation) in 1878.
Jeremy is clear this was a mistake. The best thing for biodiversity, he says, is a mosaic environment, a mixture of thorny scrub, grassy clearings and thickets of trees. It makes sense to me. Not everything can live in the darkness and stillness of a thick forest: more niches makes for more species. Pollarding provides helpful disruption, thinning the trees, allowing light for low-growers and providing dead wood for fungi, all encouraging a wider range of fauna.
In 1989, the corporation of London began regular pollarding again, but even before that a visitor here wouldn’t have seen overgrown forest. That’s because grazing rights for commoners were never removed, and cattle continued browsing parts of the woodland through most of the 20th century. As we walked through a lush clearing, Jeremy explained the importance of hungry, clumsy herbivores: they play a similar role to pollarding, causing disruption by nibbling leaves and knocking over young saplings. It’s why the trees here are in friendly gatherings, not crowds.
In the 1990s the delicate balance was upset when the BSE crisis put an end to commoner grazing. In response, the corporation introduced its own herd of longhorns. Most are brought inside for winter, but a handful are left out to help maintain the habitat. Just before sunset, Jeremy took me to Chingford Plain to see them, a hit squad of squat muscle and sharp horns within charging distance of the high street. As they began to edge in that direction, Jeremy showed me his phone, displaying a map of the area with a moving dot for each cow. As one beast neared the virtual boundary, its GPS necklace emitted a high-frequency sound, prompting the animal to lumber off in a different direction. As the light drained from the blue sky, everything here seemed in harmony: humankind, nature, technology. This is what the world can be.
A few weeks earlier I had been at Cop26 in Glasgow, and its gloomy graphs still haunted my dreams: one night I screamed myself awake. I came here needing a lift. If we are to heal the world, it is of course essential to understand how it is degrading. But as US writer Rebecca Solnit says, concentrating on what is being lost can leave us with the sense that decay is normal, inevitable. We need to hold the good bits in mind – finding wonder in what works well. We need to “take that beauty as a sacred trust, and celebrate the memory of it”, she wrote. “Otherwise we might forget why we are fighting.” There are few finer reminders than Epping Forest. Daily trains run four times an hour from London Liverpool Street and Walthamstow Central stations to Chingford (five minutes’ walk from Epping Forest)";https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/04/for-epic-trees-and-eco-rays-of-hope-take-a-train-to-epping-forest-london;5
460;460;5707;5707;Queen’s platinum jubilee year: ‘2022 will be year of mixed blessings’;2022-01-04T07:00:09Z;['Caroline Davies'];"['Queen Elizabeth II', 'Monarchy', 'UK news', ""Queen's platinum jubilee""]";As the Queen, the longest-serving British monarch in history, attains 70 years on the throne, 2022 is expected to be a year of mixed blessings – with national celebrations as well as the possibility of yet more unwelcome headlines. The monarch joins an extremely exclusive club in February when she marks her platinum jubilee, also achieved by Louis XIV of France, Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein, and, most recently King Bhumibol of Thailand. It is a first in UK royal history, with the occasion due to be celebrated over a four-day weekend in June. The festivities, including a service of thanksgiving and the colourful spectacle of a jubilee pageant, will be an undoubted highlight for the monarch, who will be 96 in April, and preparations for 2022 have long been in the planning at Buckingham Palace. “But 2022 is going to be a year of mixed blessings for her, I think,” said Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty magazine. “Clearly, there are various clouds on the horizon, the Duke of York perhaps being the biggest at the moment. But, blowing in from the west, the Duke of Sussex’s book, whatever form that may take.” The platinum jubilee The anniversary of her accession is 6 February, but it has always been a day of mixed emotions for the Queen as it is also the anniversary of the death of her father, George VI. Trooping the Colour, bringing together more than 1,400 soldiers and 200 horses, will kick off the jubilee bank holiday weekend on 2 June, when she and her family will be on the Buckingham Palace balcony watching the traditional RAF fly-past. Over the weekend there will be beacons lit, a St Paul’s cathedral service of thanksgiving, a BBC “Party at the Palace”, a jubilee pageant and street parties. “But the highlight, for her, will be the Derby,” said the royal historian Hugo Vickers. It is her first jubilee without the Duke of Edinburgh at her side – though he missed much of her diamond jubilee in 2012 after becoming ill following the Thames River Pageant. Her 2002 golden jubilee year was blighted by the deaths of her sister, Princess Margaret, and her mother. “I think during this forthcoming jubilee she will be less visible than she has been for all the previous jubilees because clearly account will be taken of her age and her health at the time things are happening,” said Little. So Charles and Camilla, and William and Kate, are likely to be bobbing around the country and Commonwealth – Covid restrictions permitting – on her behalf. “If you look at 70 years of service as a monarch, it does put some of the grumbly things that are going on rather into perspective,” said Vickers. “Jubilees are great fun.” But they are also tiring, he said. “I remember Princess Anne saying at the time of diamond jubilee that the family had to rally to make sure the Queen and Prince Philip did not get overtired.” “So I think she is going to do about 10 notable things that will be high profile.” Family reunion? One big question is whether Harry and Meghan will be on the palace balcony along with other members of the royal family for the June festivities. “You would expect the Sussexes to return to the UK for that, if not beforehand. So that could be the first opportunities for the Queen to meet the newest member of the Sussex family, Lilibet,” said Little. Royal watchers will have their metaphorical – and literal – binoculars trained for any signs of family tension, against the backdrop of reported rifts. Harry’s vocal criticism of the family, and institution, include being cut off financially by his father, Charles. His comments that he wished to break the cycle of “genetic pain and suffering” in the royal family was seen as a swipe at Charles’s parenting, as well as the Queen and Philip’s. Observers have suggested an unravelling of the father-son relationship, with the two last speaking face-to-face at Philip’s funeral in April. They did not meet when Harry was in London in July for the unveiling of a statue of his mother, Diana, and Charles has still not met Lilibet – named after the Queen’s family nickname. Harry’s memoirs Penguin Random House pulled off a coup in landing Harry’s memoirs. The publishers have described it as an “honest” and “inspiring, courageous and uplifting human story”. Harry, who is working with the Pulitzer prize winner JR Moehringer as his ghostwriter, has said: “I’m writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become.” Some question if he has much left to reveal, having been vocal since he decamped to California. “I really can’t imagine what Prince Harry can say that will be constructive. Presumably, the publishers will want him to come up with something. But if he comes up with something unattractive, I think it will backfire, in this country anyway,” said Vickers. Royal watchers are primed. One, predicting it will cause “mayhem” within palace walls, has said: “It will become an international bestseller, but at what cost to the monarchy?” If Harry goes into detail about issues involving his wife, or alleged racism within the royal family, which is denied, it will be damaging. The book is due to be published globally in the latter part of 2022. Andrew’s court case The Duke of York’s legal battle with Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has alleged that he sexually abused her when she was aged 17, while being trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, could be the blackest cloud on the horizon. The allegations are strongly denied by Andrew, with his lawyers asking for the case to be dismissed. On Monday, a previously confidential document Andrew’s legal team believes will stop the civil lawsuit against the royal was made public, showing Giuffre had entered into a “settlement agreement” in 2009 with Epstein for $500,000 (£371,000). The document provided a release for “any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant” against various claims by Giuffre. Andrew’s lawyers are expected to argue in a New York court on Tuesday that even though they say her allegations against him are baseless, Giuffre cannot even bring the case because of the document she signed. If the case is not dismissed, the New York judge Lewis Kaplan is aiming for trial between September and December, and has announced that depositions for the case must be submitted by 14 July 2022. Andrew’s name had already featured in the Ghislaine Maxwell criminal case, which last week resulted in Maxwell, a friend of Andrew’s, being convicted on five of the six charges she faced relating to sex trafficking teenage victims of Epstein’s. The Queen is reportedly footing the legal bill for her second son in the civil action case brought against Andrew by Giuffre. “At this time of her reign she should be sailing toward glorious, golden uplands, yet she has had a lot of stress – not only Harry and Andrew, but also Brexit, and possibly Scottish independence,” said Vickers.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/queens-platinum-jubilee-year-2022-will-be-year-of-mixed-blessings;1

It’s all resolutions and intentions, all inputs, no outputs. But it’s a great time, thanks to NHS Digital and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, to find out who landed in A&E in the first year of the pandemic. I pore over these lists, thrilling with schadenfreude. More than 7,000 people in England got bitten or struck by a dog in 2020-21; my dog is mental, but at least he’d never bite me and can’t, to my knowledge, use a weapon. More than 2,000 people spilled something hot on themselves, which I haven’t done for years. Nearly 1,000 people ended up in hospital having tried to climb a tree (“Accidents are preventable”, the RoSPA says, and of course it would say that, wouldn’t it, but nothing has ever seemed to me to be so entirely preventable as falling out of a tree). Power tools, hammers and saws, keeping rats, scorpions and venomous spiders – I think of all these ways I’ve stayed out of hospital, by not doing things I didn’t want to do anyway, and feel both completely blessed and unusually civic-minded. We had one domestic accident, at the signature Christmas meal, when the table was set for 15, which meant 15 crackers, and – you won’t believe it, but it’s true – 30 glasses, and everything else. Mr Z decided that he wanted beer instead of a regular Christmas drink, but none of the perfectly serviceable bottles of beer would do. Instead, he tried this mini-keg that we’ve had under a table lamp since July, and it exploded. Most of the beer, he claims, ended up in his trousers, but that doesn’t explain how we came to be mopping the ceiling, or that every glass contained a tablespoon of beer, as if I’d laid the table for tiny Vikings, or how the crackers lost their bang, or why the room still smells like a pub a week later which, actually, I don’t mind. All I could think was, oh my, that could have been so much worse. So many ways we could have ended up as an A&E statistic. It would have been such an outlier event, we’d have definitely made it on to the bulletins – something for someone else to feel smug about.

462;462;5709;5709;Teachers seek urgent talks with NSW government on school safety amid Omicron surge;2022-01-04T06:46:50Z;['Lane Sainty'];['Australian education', 'New South Wales', 'Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Health'];"The New South Wales teachers’ union has called for an urgent meeting with health and education officials to discuss safety at the onset of the new school year amid the growing Covid-19 outbreak in the state. The NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, warned absentee rates could cause chaos and said “serious questions” about safety needed to be answered before students returned to classrooms in early February. “The current plan is the plan we had when schools went into the vacation period,” he told Guardian Australia. “All that’s changed. We are now living in a very different context to what we were in the weeks prior to schools going into summer recess.” In highly vaccinated NSW, case numbers have exceeded 20,000 in recent days. Gavrielatos said schools were already heavily disrupted in 2021, when far fewer cases circulated in the state, with an average of about 40 schools a day affected by staff or students testing positive.
“That was at a time when numbers were but a fraction of what we’re seeing today,” he said. “So clearly there’s a lot of concern.” The union is seeking an “urgent meeting” with education and health officials this week to ensure a proper plan is in place. “Who knows what that plan might look like? Who knows how many cases we might have?” Gavrielatos said. “There are a number of scenarios potentially at play here, including the possibility of remote learning in certain settings.” Gavrielatos said a multi-pronged approach to Covid-19 was sorely needed in schools, where vaccination rates differ from the general NSW population. As of Monday, 78.2% of NSW children aged 12-15 were double-vaccinated, compared with 93.6% of people 16 and older. The vast majority of primary school students are currently unvaccinated, with the rollout for children aged 5-11 to begin on 10 January. Among the union’s demands are “enhancements” of rules around masks and ventilation, with an “urgent audit and stocktake” needed on air purifiers. “We need to know what on earth is happening with rapid antigen testing,” Gavrielatos said. “We need to know what efforts are being made to procure and make available that other critical component in risk mitigation strategy.” Covid-19 has generally produced a milder illness in children than adults, though it is possible for children to become severely ill and in rare cases die. Research on children and the Omicron variant is still emerging. Towards the end of the 2021 school year, measures in place for NSW schools included physical distancing and outdoor lessons where possible, mandatory vaccinations for staff and compulsory masks for staff, visitors and students in year 7 and above. Masks were strongly recommended for primary school students. • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Ventilation advice was to open doors and windows. The department said advice from NSW Health, the Doherty Institute and the World Health Organization was that “maximising natural ventilation in our learning spaces is the most effective method for minimising the spread of Covid-19, as it is a very effective way to disperse particles in the air”. But there are concerns this will not always be possible in a hot Australian summer. The department has bought air purifiers, but they will not be brought in across the board and only used in situations where, for instance, bushfire smoke or poor air quality rules out opening the window. In the UK, similar ventilation advice was criticised as unworkable in the context of a harsh winter. The education department said on Tuesday it was working closely with NSW Health “to finalise school settings for the start of the new school year and detailed advice for term 1 will be made available soon”. “The settings will be fit-for-purpose, while also providing time for schools to prepare for the beginning of classes on 1 February,” a spokesperson said. “We remain committed to reducing the disruption to schools, keeping staff and students safe, and providing a greater degree of normality in line with changes communicated in the final weeks of term 4.” The department noted vaccine appointments were available for children aged 5– 11 from 10 January. “We encourage parents to book a vaccination appointment for their child as soon as possible, as evidence shows vaccination offers excellent protection against Covid-19 for children and helps keep your family safe and well.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/teachers-seek-urgent-talks-with-nsw-government-on-school-safety-amid-omicron-surge;7
463;463;5711;5711;Queensland defends anomaly that means Covid-free travellers must quarantine longer than infected locals;2022-01-04T06:32:35Z;['Ben Smee'];['Queensland', 'Health', 'Australia news', 'Australian immigration and asylum', 'Coronavirus'];"Queensland Health has defended an anomaly in the state’s Covid rules which forces Covid-negative international travellers into a longer quarantine than people infected with the virus in the community. The state updated its public health directive for Covid-positive cases on Monday, 3 January. The rules state that anyone in Queensland informed of a Covid diagnosis must immediately isolate for seven days.
The rules for international arrivals remain unchanged since 1 January. They require all arrivals to quarantine for 14 days. Returning Australian citizens and their family members can quarantine at home if they are fully vaccinated and return a negative PCR test. The human rights lawyer Melanie Hyde has been living overseas throughout the pandemic and returned – with her partner and two-year-old daughter – to Queensland to see family. They are in home quarantine. Hyde said she contacted Queensland Health about the discrepancy, but they could not explain why international travellers required longer isolation, even when they were vaccinated and had returned negative tests. She intends to lodge a complaint with the state’s human rights commission. “I have an elderly grandmother, I have friends and family I haven’t seen for two years,” Hyde said. “I’m seeing this inconsistency and an unwillingness to do anything about it. “What’s most disappointing to me … is this apathy and lack of concern about what’s happening. The government has an obligation to make sure (Covid restrictions) have the least restrictive impact on people’s rights.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Queensland Health told Guardian Australia the state continues “to take a cautious approach as we reach vaccination milestones and ease restrictions”. “The risks associated with overseas travellers have not changed,” a spokesperson said. “While both interstate and overseas hotspots are a concern, the risk profile for overseas hotspots is greater due to several factors, including quality of vaccinations, different variants circulating overseas, and uncertainty in contact tracing processes used in other countries. “That’s why we may impose tighter restrictions than what has been set nationally.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/queensland-defends-anomaly-that-means-covid-free-travellers-must-quarantine-longer-than-infected-locals;3

465;465;5713;5713;Refuge chief Ruth Davison: ‘We face a growing need, but there is optimism’;2022-01-04T06:00:10Z;['Alexandra Topping'];['Domestic violence', 'Violence against women and girls', 'Charities', 'Society', 'UK news'];Half a century since the world’s first safe house for women and children escaping domestic violence opened in Chiswick, west London, the CEO of the charity it grew into has said demand for its services remains almost as high as during the peak of the Covid pandemic, and technology is increasingly being used as a tool of abuse. Refuge, like other domestic abuse support services, reported a surge in demand during the pandemic, as police warned that abusers had “weaponised” the virus while vulnerable women were trapped at home. The demand shows little sign of abating, says Refuge’s chief executive, Ruth Davison, who took up her post in February. Calls to the national domestic abuse helpline operated by Refuge increased by 61% between April 2020 and February 2021. “It’s now levelled off, but at a new level of demand,” said Davison. Pre-Covid, Refuge’s helpline was logging about 4,600 incoming contacts a month, including through a newly introduced live chat function online. The figure rose to 8,000 a month in the first lockdown and again in the second, and is now at about 7,000 a month. In a similar period, the charity reported a 97% increase in complex tech abuse cases, which include social media abuse but also more subtle forms of abuse such as the manipulation of smart heating, doorbell cameras or online banking. A recent example involved an abusive ex-partner implanting a listening device in the toy of a child with shared custody. “We hear really quite awful stories,” says Davison. “It’s really very pervasive. There are many ways in which technology is being misused by perpetrators to harm women and children.” There has been some progress in the last year, says Davison, pointing to the passing of the Domestic Abuse Act, which put a legal duty on local authorities to fund refuges, recognised children as victims for the first time, recognised economic abuse as a form of domestic abuse, and abolished the “rough sex” defence. But despite vocal lobbying, the bill does not protect migrant women. “Right now there are some groups of women, women with no recourse to public funds, migrant women, disabled women, who will have a very different experience accessing services – that has to change,” says Davison. This year the charity would continue lobbying for better online protection for women in the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill and the online harms bill. Things have changed massively since the first refuge was set up in 1993 by the Chiswick Women’s Aid founders, Erin Pizzey and Anne Ashby, in 1971. Carol Messenger was four years old when her mother took her and her sister from Manchester to the houseat 2 Belmont Terrace in Chiswick. She recalls that the first house was known as the battered wives’ home, “not very PC, but that’s what we all called it. In fact, someone graffitied it on the front of the building at one point. It was there for a long time.” She remembers that during the five years she spent on and off there, the house was full to bursting with mattresses, some even put in the kitchen at times. She also recalls going on marches, and squatting houses to get accommodation. “They would literally get a bunch of women, a bunch of kids and get into the houses, and they’d set us up with camping stoves and lights and eventually take them over in some cases.” Pizzey is no longer associated with Refuge, and she has been criticised for expressing the view that often women are as culpable for domestic abuse as men. Davison diplomatically says they have never met, but says that even if Pizzey’s views havehad changed, the women’s sector owes her a debt of gratitude. “She has saved hundreds of thousands of women’s lives, because she started something that’s led into a movement. Some of it she would recognise, some of it she probably wouldn’t, but all of it came from that really brave decision.” Refuge may no longer squat premises but it is as deeply political as ever, says Davison. And after a year in which rape prosecution rates fell to record lows, and a series of high-profile killings – such as those of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, and of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer – sparked public outrage, the charity is needed more than ever, she says. “The bottom line is in England, Wales, two women a week are murdered by their current or former partner, and one in four women are affected by domestic abuse,” Davison says, adding that there is a “strange tension” between optimism and dismay in the sector. “We face a very bleak reality and a growing need, but there is huge optimism and hope of what the kind of anger we have seen [in the last] year can create,” she says. “My hope is that we see a real change in public dialogue and really try to address the root causes of men’s violence and understand why we tolerated this for so long in this country.” In 50 years’ time, Davison hopes the need for Refuge to exist will be greatly diminished. “Our vision as a charity is that we will live in a world where domestic abuse is no longer tolerated,” she says. “That’s what we work for every day. There’s still a long road ahead.”;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/04/refuge-chief-ruth-davison-domestic-abuse-support-growing-need-optimism;6
466;466;5714;5714;‘We need to respect the process of healing’: a GP on the overlooked art of recovery;2022-01-04T06:00:10Z;['Gavin Francis'];['Coronavirus', 'GPs', 'NHS', 'Health'];"Over the past two years I’ve spent much of my time as a GP assessing and managing the fear, fever and breathlessness caused by coronavirus, but I’ve also spent more of my time than ever before talking to people about recovery and convalescence – not only from the virus, but from the damaging effects of repeated lockdowns. I’m a GP in central Edinburgh and, with three other doctors and two nurses, provide medical care to about 4,000 patients. The words “recovery” and “convalescence” were rarely mentioned during my six years of medical school and seven years of specialty training. Many of my tutors seemed to assume that once a crisis of illness has passed, the body and mind find ways to heal themselves. But nearly 20 years as a GP has shown me time and again that the reverse is true: guidance and encouragement through the process of recovery can be indispensable.
My medical training took for granted a western medical approach to the body. But illness is not simply a matter of biology, but also one of belief, psychology and sociology. The ways we get ill are as much about culture as they are about disease, and our ideas and expectations of the body profoundly influence the ways in which we fall ill, and the ways we recover. I have learned much from those other clinicians – the nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists – who have most helped my patients, and I am constantly being reminded of how much more there is still to learn.
What follows, then, is a discussion of recovery and convalescence as seen from within a particular medical tradition – my own as a 21st-century European general practitioner. While I acknowledge the value and the virtues of alternative approaches to the body and to illness, I will leave discussion of them to others trained in their use. It was on 31 December 2019 that the Chinese government alerted the World Health Organization to a new and dangerous strain of coronavirus that was infecting people in and around Wuhan. Humanity has learned an enormous amount over the subsequent two years – new ways of managing the pneumonia caused by the virus, as well as how to build a suite of vaccines proven to be effective against it. We move into this new year still struggling to contain a pandemic many thought would be over by now. New, more transmissible and more dangerous strains of coronavirus are still emerging. As they put our powers of recovery to the test, it’s worth thinking more deeply about what convalescence really means. * * * When I was eight years old, I woke one autumn morning with a hammer-blow headache and a churning in my stomach. My GP was called for – a kindly man of the old school who took one look and, suspecting meningitis, sent me urgently to an infectious diseases hospital an hour’s drive away where the diagnosis was confirmed. I spent eight days and nights in that hospital, in a room with large windows that gave on to trees and bright afternoon sunshine. In the niches of my memory I carry no images of the doctors, only one of a nurse in a sky-blue tunic, her black hair in a bun, her kind face lined with smiles. I remember an iron-framed bedstead, glaring white sheets and the smell of floor disinfectant. A window in an internal wall of the sickroom looked on to a nurses’ station – I was kept under continual surveillance. Though my mum and dad took shifts to be with me for most of the day, they also had my brother to attend to, and I spent many hours alone in silence waiting for them to come; waiting for home. A couple of years later, I broke my leg and was obliged to pass the whole of the summer holidays and part of the autumn school term in plaster. Beneath that plaster my leg withered and, when the plaster came off, I remember being shocked by how pallid, stunted and weakened it had become. Again, I don’t remember any of the doctors involved in my treatment. My recovery was led by a pair of brisk and cheerful physiotherapists.
With a limb, it seemed possible to objectify the part that needed recovery, to look down on the leg and say “that’s the problem, right there”. My progress was effortful, but at least I could see it, inscribed in the bulk of my thigh and the colour of my skin. My recovery from meningitis was far more difficult to grasp – the edges of what recovery meant were far less clear. A languorous, fuzzy-headed exhaustion dominated my days, burnishing the world with the bright haze of a dream or hallucination. My body was in convalescence, but the process itself felt disembodied, ethereal, as much mental as physical. As I look back on it now, it’s clear that it was my first experience of the complexities of convalescence, and how it can and must take very different forms with different illnesses and between different people. The word “rehabilitation” comes from the Latin habilis, meaning, among other things, “apt” or “fit”, and carries the sense of restoration: “To stand, make or be firm again.” The aim of rehabilitation, then, should be to make someone as fit as they can be – to stand on their own feet if they’re able, and to recover as much mobility and independence as possible if they are not. I worked once as a junior doctor in a unit dedicated to rehabilitation from brain injury, and learned there that convalescence is anything but a passive process. Though its rhythms and its tempo are often slow and gentle, it’s an act, and actions need us to be present, to engage, to give of ourselves. Whether it’s our knees or skulls that need to heal from an injury, or lungs from a viral infection such as Covid-19, or brains from a concussion, or minds from a crisis of depression or anxiety, I often have to remind my patients that it’s worth giving adequate time, energy and respect to the process of healing. There is no hierarchy to suffering, and it’s not possible to say of one group of conditions that they deserve sympathy while another group deserves to be dismissed. I’ve known patients whose lives have been dominated for years by the grief of a failed love affair, and others who have taken the most disabling injuries, pain, indignity and loss of independence in their stride. Though it can be tempting to resent someone whose illness appears to be less serious than our own, or to judge ourselves harshly when others seem to be coping with more challenging circumstances than we are, comparisons are rarely helpful. Neither is it advisable to set out a strict timetable of recovery: it’s more important to set achievable goals. Sometimes, all I can do is reassure my patients that I believe improvement of some kind is possible. The recovery I’m reassuring them of might not be biological in nature – in terms of a resolution of their condition – but rather an improvement in their circumstances. * * * In the course of my medical work I sometimes see viral infections sending their sufferers to bed for weeks or months, and, in a few cases, for years. Why this happens is poorly understood. It’s as if the struggle with illness draws so deeply on one’s inner reserves of strength that the body does all it can to retain its energies, even going so far as to manipulate our sense of effort so that to take a short walk, or to climb a flight of stairs, is to risk exhaustion. Through the successive waves of Covid-19 during 2020 and 2021, I spoke to many patients in whom coronavirus has triggered this kind of enduring fatigue. A letter in the journal Nature Medicine published last March reported that, for their sample group, one in eight victims of Covid-19 suffered symptoms lasting longer than four weeks, one in every 22 had symptoms lasting longer than eight weeks, and one in 44 patients had symptoms lasting longer than 12 weeks. The most persistent symptoms were breathlessness, loss of smell, headache and fatigue. Physiotherapists encourage people experiencing relentless post-viral fatigue to gently push at the limits of what they can do in terms of physical effort. They’ve found that if those limits are not tested, then the realm of the possible begins to shrink – horizons contract, muscles weaken and sufferers can become trapped in a cycle of effort followed by collapse. The effort required to provoke each collapse begins to dwindle. Everyone has a different tempo of convalescence, and will require different strategies. It’s normal that the process can be slow, and normal, too, for long-term illness to vary in its manifestations from person to person. Protracted symptoms from viral infections may differ enormously between different individuals, but can include varying amounts of breathlessness, difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, mood changes, insomnia, weight loss, weight gain, exhaustion, muscle weakness, joint stiffness and flashbacks. When I see patients troubled by these kinds of problems, I try to emphasise that to experience them isn’t evidence that recovery has stalled, or is going into reverse. On the contrary, those symptoms are evidence that the body and mind are reacting and changing in response to the illness – and where there’s change, there’s hope. There is a booklet I hand out to people with ongoing symptoms of Covid-19, written by local physiotherapists, that emphasises the importance of this “pacing” approach to recovery. It’s an attitude I’ve benefited from myself.
During my first year in training as a GP, I got sick. I’d worked for many years in hospitals, had already qualified as a trainee in emergency medicine, but the intensity and breadth of problems I was learning to face in my new role as a doctor in the community felt to me almost overwhelming. An old problem with my sinuses flared up, leaving me with a ceaseless, drilling headache above the eyes that sapped all of my energy. I was exhausted, couldn’t concentrate and was in chronic pain. An MRI scan showed that I needed surgery, which might take months to arrange. In the meantime, I had my GP training to complete. I couldn’t do anything to speed the arrival of my operation date, but I could do something about my exhaustion and my levels of stress. Rather than stop work altogether, I reduced my hours to a three-day week – each day in clinic would be followed by a day off to recover. The headache was as bad as ever, but with more time to rest and recuperate between clinic days, the pain bothered me less. Knowing I’d have the breathing space of a day at home meant that I was able to give my best to my patients on those days I was in the clinic. My training would be delayed – it would now take longer than a year for me to be signed off as a competent GP – but I persuaded myself that there was no point risking burnout for the sake of a schedule of someone else’s making. And I qualified all the same, albeit a couple of months late. The operation, when it came, was successful, my headaches were cured, and I had learned a valuable lesson. We need strength and energy to live with illness. Cutting my workload gave me the reserves I needed not just to live with chronic pain until the operation, but to begin slowly on the path towards recovery from it. * * * All worthwhile acts of recovery have to work in concert with natural processes, not against them. Many antibiotics don’t “kill” bacteria as such, but merely inhibit the growth of bacterial colonies and leave the body to do the rest. A doctor who sets out to “heal” is in truth more like a gardener who sets out to “grow” – actually, nature does almost all the work. Even when I stitch a patient’s wound, the suture material itself does not knit the tissues – that thread is simply a trellis to guide the body in its own work of healing. This idea of the body as belonging to the green, organic world is something often forgotten in the clinics and hospital wards where I’ve trained and worked – so much so that it came as a surprise to read of a physician who has taken it to the heart of her clinical management. Victoria Sweet is an associate professor of medicine at the University of California in San Francisco. For many years she worked in one of the last almshouses in the United States – a hospital for the poor who have nowhere else to go. Sweet’s book God’s Hotel: A Doctor, a Hospital and a Pilgrimage to the Heart of Medicine explains how, after reading about the medieval healer Hildegard of Bingen, she came to the conclusion that, to better describe the aims of recovery, we should resurrect Hildegard’s medieval concept of viriditas, or “greening” – to be healed is to be reinvigorated by the same force that gives life to trees as much as it does human beings. She, too, observed that the work of the physician is much more like that of a gardener than it is like a mechanic. This makes intuitive sense: until very recently, physicians had to study botany, not only because so many medicines are derived from plants, but because the study of plants is a way to understand life itself. The GP I had as a child – the one who sent me urgently to hospital with meningitis – told me later that he had to take botany classes as part of his medical school curriculum in the 1950s. It is as if, with the pharmaceutical revolutions of the later 20th century, we have forgotten something of the importance of a broader approach to recovery. It has been shown that patients recovering in a hospital bed need less pain-relieving medication if they have a view out over something green, growing and alive. This was recognised long ago by Florence Nightingale, but seemingly forgotten by the modern architects of our hospitals. The word “physician” can be rooted back to the Greek physis, meaning “nature”, and phuo, which means “to grow”. Just like a plant, what we need in order to grow back into wholeness is a “regime” of the right nutrients, the right environment and the right attitude – and to be left in peace. This attitude to recovery has been crowded out in modern medicine because it takes time. Sweet wouldn’t want to return to medieval medicine, and wouldn’t give up our blood tests and scans, our robotic surgery or antibiotics. But she would like to see the value of time restored to the practice of medicine – and so would I. * * * Doctors and nurses bring their own personalities and experience to every medical encounter, and we know that people recover more quickly from physical conditions if they perceive their clinician to be sympathetic to their concerns. Psychological research into “compassion fatigue” has shown that most students begin clinical studies with a great deal of compassion, but the longer they work in caring professions, the more they seem to lose it. The word “doctor” comes from docere, meaning “to teach” or “to guide”, and just as every teacher you’ve ever had works with a different style, so does every doctor. The idea that there’s a universal approach every practitioner should adopt is false, and would be a terrible way to offer medical care. In the 30 or 40 medical encounters I have in the course of a normal working day, there must be several that I misjudge, guessing wrongly which kind of doctor that particular patient needs me to be. I’m not sure this kind of intuition is something that can necessarily be taught. But what can be taught is the confidence to act on the small voices of conscience and experience that suggest when a therapeutic relationship will benefit from going off-piste – away from the well-trimmed paths of textbook solutions into something wilder, more unscripted and perhaps more effective. Within modern medicine, this creates a conflict, between an idea of a clinical encounter that should be measurable, reproducible and thus open to professional regulation of standards, and the idea of the clinical encounter as an alchemy that combines the experience of two human beings in an unrepeatable moment that changes both of them. Doctors have to be well grounded in the science of medicine – that isn’t up for debate. But what is open to question is whether scientific knowledge is where medical practice ends, or where it begins. The answer might of course be different in different situations. I have some patients who see me solely as the conduit through which to gain access to specialists, and others who want from me, as a representative of the medical establishment, the scientific facts of their particular condition. And at the other end of the spectrum I’ve known patients for whom the aim of our consultations is to feel cared for, and to be given a sense of confidence in their recovery even when their condition is one that can’t be cured. Just as some people need to understand the science of their disease in order to better appreciate how to defeat it, others need to understand illness as a story that is tending towards a happy ending. I’m happy to take whichever approach the patient prefers: the biology of an illness, or its biography. Both are equally valid ways of approaching medical encounters. Similarly we would do well, as a profession, to expand the notion of what counts as a therapy.
Drugs can be the least of healing, and the idea that therapies must be something that you swallow or inject – that they should be pills or syrups or infusions – is manifestly untrue. I’ve seen choirs, walking groups, gardening clubs and voluntary work revolutionise the health of patients of mine, and there are many opportunities, frequently unexploited, for patients to become their own best physicians, often with the help of non-medical agencies. Similarly, there can be non-medical solutions that help greatly with medical problems. For a gambling addict I knew, the most effective therapy was referral to a debt counsellor. For a woman struggling against drug dependency, starving herself to feed her habit, it was referral to a food bank. Having enough food in the cupboard gave her the peace of mind to be able to address her addiction. For a fit, newly retired and newly widowed man I knew, it was volunteering in a charity shop that helped him the most. For someone escaping the stress of an abusive marriage with her three children, it was a phone call to the local branch of Women’s Aid. For an immigrant family living in a damp, cramped slum that was worsening one child’s asthma, it was a letter to the housing department. Clinicians such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists drop in and out of patients’ lives so fleetingly that for most people in recovery, the majority of caring work is done by family and friends. Some of my patients over the years have found it difficult to remember the needs and the frustrations of loved ones who are doing the bulk of that work. But the contributions of those around us to healing are irreplaceable, and their resilience is something to be cherished and protected. It, too, may hold the key to recovery. * * * It is a tyranny to assume that positivity can overcome all obstacles. Much of what constitutes illness consists of things we cannot change. In his book Between Sickness and Health: The Landscape of Illness and Wellness, the rehabilitation specialist Christopher Ward has written of how his first step with a new patient is always to acknowledge their suffering, and to then redefine the goals of treatment not necessarily as “rehabilitation”, but as “possibilitation”: the opportunity of each person to work towards the best possible version of their life. Even with the advances of 21st-century medical technology, surgery, DNA profiling and gene therapy, the list of illnesses that can be definitively cured is surprisingly short. In terms of drugs or quick fixes, medicine has depressingly little to offer people suffering from long Covid symptoms. But for all that the western medical attitude to the body and illness frequently disappoints, it remains a powerful approach, and for that reason has been adopted in some form or another across much of the globe. Even its ability to define and name our illnesses can offer consolation – I’ve seen many reassured by that act of naming, comforted by the knowledge that what afflicts them has an existence separate from themselves. The naming of an illness offers access to a community of others who have found ways of living with the same difficulties, and that itself can be a source of hope. But there’s a paradox at work: categorising an illness can offer a false sense of definition, locking us into an expectation that becomes self-fulfilling. I’ve known patients who accept the label of an illness with relief, and others who detest all labels as stigmatising. Where possible, I try to take those preferences into account. The reality of mind and body is one of dynamism and change – any vision of human life that is static at heart is an illusion. Sometimes the most helpful attitude to adopt is not to think of illness categories as concrete, immutable destinies, but as stories of the mind and the body. Within certain impassable limits, stories can be rewritten.
No one is getting any younger, and all of us would do well to remember that health can never be a final destination, but a balance between extremes, different for everyone, and whether we achieve it or not depends on our goals and priorities as much as it depends on anatomy and physiology. Every illness is unique, which means that all recoveries must also be in some sense unique. There is no one-size-fits-all to getting better. And though I have tried to set out some principles that have proven helpful over the years in guiding me, and my patients, through the many landscapes of illness, I’m conscious that it’s possible to touch on only a few waypoints – it’s rarely possible to indicate an easy way out. It’s a landscape we all have to visit sooner or later. From time to time we all need to learn the art of convalescence. Recovery by Gavin Francis (Profile, £4.99).

467;467;5715;5715;NHS unable to treat every child with eating disorder as cases soar;2022-01-04T06:00:09Z;['Andrew Gregory'];['Eating disorders', 'UK news', 'NHS', 'Health', 'Mental health', 'Society', 'England'];The NHS can no longer treat every child with an eating disorder, a leading psychiatrist has warned, as “worrying” figures reveal hospital admissions have risen 41% in a year. A dramatic surge in cases during the pandemic has left already struggling community services overstretched with many unable to care for everyone who requires help, experts said. NHS Digital data for England shows a sharp rise in admissions in every area of the country. The provisional data for April to October 2021 – the most recent available – shows there were 4,238 hospital admissions for children aged 17 and under, up 41% from 3,005 in the same period the year before. The 2021 figure is also a 69% rise on the pre-pandemic year of 2019. From April to October 2019, there were 2,508 admissions for those aged 17 and under. Charities said the fast rising number of hospital admissions was “only the tip of the iceberg”, with thousands more children needing support for eating disorders. Dr Agnes Ayton, the chair of the eating disorders faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “The hidden epidemic of eating disorders has surged during the pandemic, with many community services now overstretched and unable to treat the sheer number of people needing help. We are at the point where we cannot afford to let this go on any longer. “Early intervention is key to recovery and to preventing serious illness, which is why it’s crucial that the money announced by government urgently reaches the frontline. The government must also deliver a workforce plan to tackle the shortages in eating disorder services so that they have enough staff to treat everyone who needs help.” Tom Madders, the director of campaigns at YoungMinds, said the figures were “worrying” and said the impact of the last two years had “left many young people isolated, uncertain about the future and with less control over their lives”. The Guardian reported last September how record numbers of children and young people were seeking access to NHS mental health services, as the devastating toll of the pandemic was revealed in a new analysis. In just three months, nearly 200,000 young people were referred to mental health services – almost double pre-pandemic levels, according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Madders said many young people had struggled to get “timely support” for their mental health before the pandemic and the last two years had deepened the crisis. “We know the NHS is under increasing pressure and staff are working extremely hard to support those that need it, but it’s clear the government must redouble its efforts and ensure that it improves access to NHS services,” he added. “It’s also crucial that early support is available for young people in their local communities, which is why we want to see the government invest in a network of early support hubs.” Overall, the data shows there were 23,302 admissions for eating disorders among all age groups in the financial year 2020-21, up 13% from 20,647 admissions in 2019-20. The 2020-21 figure is also up 21% on the 19,244 admissions among all age groups recorded in 2018-19. Provisional data for April to October 2021 shows there were 15,941 admissions so far among all age groups, suggesting 2021-22 will be the highest year yet for people needing inpatient treatment, whatever their age. The new NHS data shows that 5,941 admissions among all ages from April to October 2021 were for anorexia. The next biggest set of admissions, at 3,263, were for bulimia. Hospital admissions are most common in adults aged 18 to 39, the figures show, with 8,298 in this age group from April to October 2021. There are also regional differences, with a higher number of hospital admissions in the south-east and south-west than in many other regions. Tom Quinn, the director of external affairs at the eating disorders charity Beat, said: “It is concerning that the number of hospital admissions for people with eating disorders is continuing to increase. “We know that accessing quality community treatment reduces the chances of somebody needing hospital care, and so the rise in admissions suggests that people are not getting the support that they need quickly enough.” Quinn said the pandemic had had a “devastating impact” on people with eating disorders, which had contributed to the rise in the number of people needing support. He added: “The number of hospital admissions is only the tip of the iceberg, and there are many other people needing support for an eating disorder.” He urged ministers to publish data about the number of people waiting for eating disorder treatment, in order to “better understand” the scale of demand.;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/04/nhs-unable-to-treat-every-child-with-eating-disorder-as-cases-soar;5
468;468;5716;5716;Don’t surrender BBC in face of political attacks, Melvyn Bragg urges;2022-01-04T06:00:09Z;['Kevin Rawlinson'];['BBC', 'Melvyn Bragg', 'Politics', 'Culture', 'Television industry', 'Media', 'UK news', 'BBC licence fee'];The government’s politically motivated attacks on the BBC are part of a general abasement of British institutions in recent years, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg has warned, as he called for the corporation to be protected. Bragg accused ministers of failing to recognise the value of the institution, which he said has earned the country’s support. His comments follow what some see as a sustained campaign by government ministers intent on waging a culture war, with the BBC as a key front. “Recently, it has sometimes seemed that, sadly, we are becoming a lesser country by the year,” he told the Radio Times. “I hope the BBC is not allowed to become part of this surrender to a creeping deterioration. Indeed, I believe it could lead by example if we want to escape a situation where our great institutions are increasingly damaged for political purposes. “It comes down to what sort of country we want this to be. The BBC has earned our respect and repaid our support, in war and peace, over many years. It has built itself in our image. Surely, now that it is so clearly up against it, we cannot let it down.” Bragg, who has spent most of his television career at ITV, has previously spoken out in defence of the BBC, declaring himself “foursquare” behind it. In an interview with the same magazine last summer, he said the BBC was worth “storming the Bastille” to save and would never be reinvented if it was destroyed. “Have a go at it, fine. But to try to damage it, as some people are doing, try to pull it down? The BBC is worth fighting hard for, worth storming the Bastille for, and saying: ‘No, you can’t do that’.” In recent years, government ministers have sought to influence the BBC’s news coverage by painting criticism of them as political bias. They threatened to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee – a move that would probably hit the BBC’s finances hard – and they tried to pave the way for a longstanding and staunch opponent of the BBC to be installed as the head of the broadcasting regulator Ofcom. Ministers also tried to block the appointment of a respected journalist who had previously stood up for a colleague who was being publicly attacked by a member of the government. A former adviser to Theresa May reportedly warned of negative political consequences for the BBC should the appointment go ahead. And the prime minister used a minor row over whether Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory should be played as instrumental pieces only at the annual Proms to portray the BBC as unpatriotic.;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/04/dont-surrender-bbc-in-face-of-political-attacks-melvyn-bragg-urges;1
469;469;5717;5717;As the Conservatives implode, the red wall suddenly seems in Labour’s grasp | Polly Toynbee;2022-01-04T06:00:09Z;['Polly Toynbee'];['Labour', 'Keir Starmer', 'Politics', 'Conservatives', 'UK news', 'Brexit', 'Foreign policy', 'European Union', 'Economics', 'Business'];"“I fucking hate the Labour party, they’re a fucking disgrace … They’ve betrayed the working classes, they’ve betrayed ordinary people.” Thus spake Noel Gallagher, the former Oasis guitarist, and out it poured on to Twitter. Well, he would, wouldn’t he? He long ago regretted that embarrassing Cool Britannia moment of euphoria when Tony Blair summoned stars to a 1997 Downing Street party. Gallagher’s purist state of mind is shared by a rump of the left, who feel forever betrayed. In my last column I looked ahead with a glimmer of optimism that, after 12 wilderness years, Labour might be on the road back to power. The usual below-the-line warfare had broken out, with responses such as: “I left the Labour party. I will not vote for Starmer, his policies or anyone who supports him.” “He has introduced a Stalin-like purge of the membership, the grassroots, the activists.” “They are worse than the Conservatives.” “A clone of the Tory party.” “Tory-lite.” “Cancelled my membership.” Here’s a Twitter trope I get all the time: Polly Toynbee and the Guardian helped put the Tories in power (often accompanied by the hashtag #rightwingmedia). Odd this, as the Guardian (and I) backed Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour against the Tories in 2017 and 2019. If only we had such influence, the Tories wouldn’t have governed twice as long as Labour all my life. Sometimes I answer back, other times I retell what Labour achieved when last in power: SureStart, tax credits, civil partnerships, more doctors, nurses and beds that helped reduce long hospital waits, increased school and further education funds, an Equality and Human Rights Commission, free entry to museums, a doubling of foreign aid, free nurseries, lifting more than a million pensioners and more than a million children out of absolute poverty – despite the tragedy of Iraq. But of course this legacy wasn’t enough. It was too easily uprooted, never satisfying the limitless hopes of those of us on the left. Maybe it’s admirable to hold out for better, but I will always back whoever I think can best deny the Conservatives power. Yes, sometimes, that means compromising to win votes. As our archaic electoral system kills new parties, capturing an existing one is the only viable route for a political cause. Labour has had periods of leftist entryism after losing elections. But suddenly that online raucousness sounds like voices from the past, fringe noises coming from outside a party that has since transformed itself. Labour MPs now find local parties no longer locked in warfare. Over the next weeks they are all up for reselection: expect no upsets. The tail end of the antisemitism trauma is dragging on with expensive court cases: Corbyn stays out while he rejects the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s overall findings on antisemitism. Meanwhile the shadow cabinet is proposing policies such as wealth taxes, a £28bn green new deal and fair pay deals, all of which refutes the “Tory clone” jibe. The party is inching towards electability. But look on the other side, where the Tory party is devouring itself, eaten up by the Ukip-inflected extremists who have been selecting its MPs for years. Brexit was their opening salvo but this breed of libertarians are now pushing other policies – spending cuts and deregulation – that are unsellable. A recent poll of 57 red wall seats in the Mail on Sunday put Labour 16 points ahead of the Conservatives and up five points nationally, with Keir Starmer outscoring Boris Johnson. The paper revealed a litany of lost voter trust, reporting “panic among MPs who fear they are doomed” and a “frenzy of bitching”. The chancellor’s rift with the prime minister runs through the party, which summoned a Pied Piper populist to bribe voters but balks at paying for his tune. With Rishi Sunak’s wallet shut, the only thing Michael Gove can magic up for his delayed “levelling up” policy is ectoplasm. With no shine left on Brexit or Johnson, there’s no glue holding that strange north-south voter coalition together.
The months ahead will bring even more problems. April’s cost-of-living collision of rising inflation, energy bills, national insurance and council taxes will punish the government in May’s local elections. Rarely has Labour ever been quite as out of touch with voters as the brand of libertarianism that is consuming the Tory party. Nearly 100 Conservative MPs voted against Covid precautions despite public backing for compulsory passports. The cabinet took a reckless position on new year clubbing, yet the Sunday Telegraph still complained that “Nannyism has won”. Its recent editorial commanded the Tories to “fulfil Brexit, deregulate, lower taxes” in a country “swollen by regulations and spending”. This crescendo of libertarian demands is the only tune you now hear from the Tories and their press as the party vacates the playing field, just as Labour steps up to re-engage voters. The right’s “freedoms” of post-Brexit deregulation would have publicly unacceptable consequences. Do they mean dirty food, Dickensian labour and unsafe buildings, unchecked by ridiculed environmental health officers? They never say. Abandoning their tax rise would lead to the NHS and social care collapsing. This new strain of rightwing anarchy is no longer anchored to old conservative interests in business, agriculture or even the City. It’s new to hear industrialists, farmers and financiers angry at damage done by their erstwhile party. The Tories seem unhinged by Brexit’s balloon bursting, with the UK losing £12bn of trade in October alone and the Office for Budget Responsibility estimating Brexit will cause a 4% drop in GDP. It seems unlikely that this out-of-control party will choose anyone who can bring them back to earth before an election. If not, impulsive spending cuts and deregulations will lose them votes, and Labour will be right there, feet firmly planted on the ground. • Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/conservatives-implode-red-wall-labours-grasp;2
