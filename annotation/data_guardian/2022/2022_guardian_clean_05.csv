5718;5718;Weatherwatch: Andorra’s continental and alpine climate;2022-01-04T06:00:09Z;['Stephen Moss'];['Andorra', 'Europe'];"The principality of Andorra is sandwiched between France and Spain in the eastern Pyrenees. The sixth-smallest country in Europe, with an area of 180 sq miles (468 sq km), it is smaller than every English county apart from Rutland. Landlocked, and lying entirely above 840 metres (2,750ft), the climate is, as you would expect, mostly continental and alpine. Because Andorra lies on the southern, Spanish side of the highest peaks, which run along its northern border, it is more sheltered and drier than locations on the French side. Winters are fairly cold, dry and sunny, with as much as five hours of daily sunshine in January and February. Winter temperatures in the capital, Andorra la Vella, are mostly a few degrees above freezing and precipitation is mostly low – just 160mm (6.3in) from December to February. However, heavy snowfalls can occur, especially when fronts sweep in from the Atlantic to the west. In Soldeu, at an altitude of 1,800 metres (5,900ft), temperatures are much colder throughout the year, staying below freezing from December to March. Temperatures rise rapidly from May onwards, with average daily maxima of the mid-20s Celsius (high 70s Fahrenheit) in the summer months; pleasantly warm but rarely very hot. The wettest months are usually May and June, when there are regular thunderstorms. Rainfall is low and fairly regular for the remainder of the year.";https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/04/weatherwatch-andorra-continental-alpine-climate
5719;5719;‘We were the AYBs – the angry young Blacks’: the art movement that rocked Thatcher’s Britain;2022-01-04T06:00:09Z;['Sasha Mistlin'];['Art', 'Painting', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'Sculpture', 'British identity and society', 'Society', 'Race', 'UK news', 'Black British culture'];"Shortly after Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in May 1979, Eddie Chambers made an artwork called Destruction of the National Front. Then a 19-year-old student in Wolverhampton, Chambers reconfigured the union jack as a swastika, before tearing it into fragments across four panels. The image stands as a defiant rebuke to a resurgent far right, evoking the anger many Black Britons felt at the time. The work was emblematic of the Blk Art Group, a radical association of young Black artists founded by Chambers in 1979. The group, stylised as Blk and pronounced “Black”, aimed to combat racism with work that focused on the experience of being Black in Thatchers’ Britain, while promoting a distinctly Black British political identity. Although short-lived – it only lasted for five years – the group casts a long shadow over British art, through its influence on subsequent generations of Black artists and its impact on contemporaries such as Lubaina Himid and Sonia Boyce. More than 40 years on from the group’s foundation, Keith Piper, 60, still looks every inch the artist in his red flannel shirt and goatee. Malta-born and raised in Birmingham, he now lives in London, though his accent is still unmistakably Brummie. Piper met Chambers in 1979 while studying at Lanchester Polytechnic, Coventry, now known as Coventry University. “I overheard him talking about a show,” he says, referring to Black Art An’ Done, held at Wolverhampton Art Gallery. “I thought, ‘He’s very serious.’ But we had a lot in common because we were the only two Black students on the course.” Chambers quickly set about recruiting Black students from West Midlands’ art schools and soon their ranks grew. By 1982, Dominic Dawes, Claudette Johnson, Wenda Leslie, Ian Palmer, Donald Rodney and Marlene Smith had joined. “Eddie was a great organiser,” says Piper, “but we all had our own specific creative concerns.”
The group’s work features prominently in a new exhibition at Tate Britain, Life Between Islands, which focuses on the work of British artists of Caribbean heritage. Life Between Islands was co-curated by the director of Tate Britain, Alex Farquharson, and David A Bailey, an artist and contemporary of the Blk group. You can see how their work influenced subsequent generations, not least the Black YBAs Chris Ofili, Yinka Shonibare and Steve McQueen. Chambers, now professor of art history and African diaspora art at the University of Texas at Austin, epitomised Blk’s political approach. How Much Longer You Bastards, from 1983, directly challenged the activities of Barclay’s bank in South Africa at a time when Margaret Thatcher was refusing to impose sanctions on the apartheid regime. The collage features the bank’s logo alongside pages from the Financial Times and a widely publicised image of parents carrying their dead child after the 1976 Soweto uprising, to illustrate British complicity in the inhumanity of apartheid.
Piper, in turn, incorporated text into pieces such as 1983’s The Body Politic in order to articulate complex narratives of dehumanisation and torture, for which he took inspiration from the work of Gavin Jantjes and Rasheed Areen. The work features two naked and headless bodies – a white woman, a black man – with identical text alongside each figure: “To you I was always (just) a body.” Piper says: “I needed the audience to understand the hostile scrutiny Black bodies came under from the white majority.” The group’s work was always rooted in the politics of the era. “Wolverhampton was one of a number of places to be decimated by the experiment Thatcher was undertaking,” says Piper. “It was the usual tensions of the 1980s – the far right on the rise, anti-apartheid, Greenham Common, policing, the New Cross Fire. It was a very politicised time – and that was core to my perspective as a young Black man.” This febrile atmosphere was evident in the reception the group received. They were immediately polarising: a breath of fresh air in some quarters, an unwelcome source of aggravation in others. “We were surrounded by a lot of reactionary forces, people who were openly hostile,” says Piper. At a 1983 showing of The Pan-Afrikan Connection at the Herbert in Coventry, complaints from a security guard about the exhibition’s subject matter forced the gallery to erect a warning notice outside the entrance: “Not suitable for people under 18.” Even on the left, the group’s work was largely dismissed. A note left in the visitors’ book read: “Angry. Too angry … more Marxist approach needed.” In the Guardian, Irene McManus wrote: “Their work is really just a collection of political posters.” But some Blk members are now considered innovative. Donald Rodney was a leading figure, who died in 1998 at just 36. “Donald was a very active and energetic person,” says Piper, who shared a Nottingham flat with the artist in the early 1980s and is now a trustee of his estate. Completed shortly before his death, In the House of My Father is a closeup photograph of Rodney’s hand. In his palm is a tiny sculpture of a house made of pieces of his own skin. Rodney suffered from sickle cell anaemia, an extremely painful blood condition that is particularly common in people of African or Caribbean heritage.
The artist and curator Marlene Smith was 18 when she joined the group and believes they shared a vision. “We were very coherent, both in terms of our pan-Africanism but also in wanting to make Black lives visible. There was a lot of protest in the work but what’s overlooked sometimes is the humanity.” Pan-Africanism – the idea that African peoples and diaspora share a common history and identity, often symbolised through the colours red, gold and green – was a guiding principle for the group. “We wanted to illustrate the connection between Victorian colonialism and the struggle that we had as teenagers to find our place,” says Smith. “We were all children of Windrush but, for me, pan-Africanism wasn’t just about making sense of the world but also about making sense of me.” The movement could only provide limited answers, however. “Pan-Africanism really fed me but it couldn’t help me understand the role gender played in my identity. We were devouring books in an attempt to make sense of that time.” She mentions Ain’t I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism, by bell hooks, who died last month, as well as the work of Toni Morrison and Alice Walker. Smith’s 1985 sculptural installation Good Housekeeping depicts a Black woman beneath the words: “My mother opens the door at 7am she is not bulletproof.” The work was a direct response to the police shooting of Cherry Groce, who was left permanently paralysed by the incident that incited the 1985 Brixton Uprising.
Smith remembers the first meeting of Blk at Chambers’ parents house: “Claudette Johnson did an absolutely jaw-dropping job of showing her work in relation to the canon – Picasso, Rubens, Manet’s Olympia. She showed us how Black women were seen as decorative in art history, either as exotica, or evidence of how wealthy someone was.” In a statement for The Pan-Afrikan Connection, Johnson wrote: “While the black woman experiences oppression on the grounds of her sex, sexuality and race, there is not yet a word that describes the specific and deliberate nature of this oppression.” As she says now: “The word ‘intersectionality’ didn’t exist at the time.” Johnson’s career stalled in the 1990s but has restarted in earnest. Last month she presented a solo exhibition, Still Here, at Hollybush Gardens in London. “The oppression of black women was a hot potato. It could be seen as divisive. People would ask me where I was putting my energy in terms of fighting for change: are you black, or are you a woman?” Johnson’s 2017 work Reclining Figure was emblematic, she says, of “the subtle and dramatic difference that occurs when the person doing the gazing was a black female herself.” This almost lifesize image depicts an exhausted Black woman lying horizontal. “My mum used to adopt a similar position on the sofa after she’d been on her feet all day. I had in mind that poignant moment when she finally wasn’t doing something for someone else.” Of Blk, she says: “In the 1980s, we were seen as people passing through – so much of our work was about making the point that we were here to stay.” Sonia Boyce was a contemporary, as was the future Turner-prize winner Lubaina Himid. Smith and Johnson both mention The Thin Black Line, a show curated by Himid at the Institute for Contemporary Arts in 1985, as the high-water mark of Black British art in the period. The show featured key works from 11 Black female artists, including Johnson, Smith and Boyce, along with Himid herself. “That show was like storming the citadel,” says Johnson. “Lubaina had gone to the Royal College and was trying to find black artists – she curated, she wrote, she was like a magnet gathering different artists together. In terms of persuasive power, she was very similar to Eddie Chambers.”
Blk’s members were not only defined by their youth (at 25, Johnson was the oldest when the group disbanded) but also by their art school education. “Blk wasn’t outsider art,” says Johnson. “We were full of hope that we could change things – that our art could mobilise black people and inspire white people to see us differently. We were trying to bring in a new audience that hadn’t been served by those galleries before.” Beyond Blk, 1980s Britain was fertile ground for a thriving ecosystem of Black artists. Now 74, Tam Joseph was both a forerunner and a contemporary of Blk. Sitting in his paint and dust strewn studio, he explains how his childhood in Dominica lends his work a different emphasis. “I am Windrush,” he says. “I didn’t experience growing up as a Black child in England.” By way of explaining his approach, he says: “I love taking the mickey.” And he points to a bubble-wrapped painting of Jimi Hendrix as Frans Hals’s Laughing Cavalier. “Hendrix looks more like a cavalier than a fat white man,” he says. Another painting, 1982’s The Spirit of Carnival, encapsulates the legacy of police aggression towards British Caribbean communities. The image features a carnival masquerader, alone in a sea of British police; Joseph was inspired by his experience at the 1976 Notting Hill carnival, where a riot broke out after police clashed with revellers. Debates around education, housing and the police were central to the work of many Black artists in the 1980s. Joseph’s 1983 work UK School Report depicts the passage of a Black child through the British education system in three portraits captioned: “Good at sports”, “Likes music” and “Needs surveillance”. The director and artist Steve McQueen has mentioned the work in reference to his Year 3 photo series.
While at art school, Denzil Forrester was charged with using insulting language after he was apprehended outside a jewellery shop in London. “They thought I was casing the joint but I was just drawing it. They came over to see what I was doing and my expensive college camera attracted their attention!” Forrester frequently painted nightclubs in his early career and says he “only started painting about the police after my friend Winston Rose was killed in 1981. I could never have done Three Wicked Men without my knowledge of what happened to Winston. I really had to work hard to capture the darkness of that London street.” Born in Grenada, Forrester moved to Britain aged 11. “Everywhere was dark and grey,” he says. “I never painted in the West Indies but I studied painting because my school in Stoke Newington had an art room. It was the only time you were allowed to do what you want. Once I got into art school, I knew there was no stopping me.” The Blk Art Group disbanded shortly after the second National Black Art Convention in 1984. Most left the West Midlands after their art degrees concluded, primarily heading to London for gallery work or postgraduate study. “It was Eddie’s founding impulse that brought us all together,” says Piper. “When he lost that impulse, we went our separate ways.” “The YBAs took the DIY strategies we used in alternative spaces and applied them in some of the biggest institutions,” says Marlene Smith. “We were the AYBs – angry young Blacks,” she jokes. Picking up on this theme, Johnson says: “We wanted to be more political than previous generations of Black artists. We used the N-word and were unafraid to reference violence, lynchings and slavery in our collective resistance to the Thatcher government. Sometimes I’m surprised the work still seems to speak to people more than 30 years later, but then the struggles we were articulating are the struggles of many still.”
Says Piper: “We were serious about seizing space and time in the venues that had previously only been open to white artists. But we were also just young kids, egging each other on and having a good time. We were supposed to be talking about the logistics of shows but we’d mostly fight about politics and music – mainly Reggae, Mod, Ska-revival and 2-Tone in those days … It was a bizarre and multilayered era but a very important one in terms of the consolidation of Black communities in this country.” Looking back, Piper thinks it was remarkable how fully formed the group’s vision was at the outset: by the time Chambers applied for degree courses, Destruction of the National Front was already under his belt: “I remember him working away in his room, marking up these flags and tearing them to pieces. It’s mad to think he was turned down with that in his portfolio. Now it’s part of the national collection at the Tate.” • This article was amended on 4 January 2022. Piper met Chambers in 1979 while studying at Lanchester Polytechnic, Coventry, which is now Coventry University. An earlier version said the institution was “now Wolverhampton School of Art”.

5720;5720;Airbnb blocks Oregon hosts from seeing guests’ names in push against racial bias;2022-01-04T06:00:08Z;['N/A'];['Airbnb', 'Oregon', 'US news', 'Race'];Airbnb rental hosts in the state of Oregon will no longer be able to see guests’ names before approving their bookings, according to a new plan announced by the company. The policy update is specific to Oregon, for now, and was born out of a lawsuit in which three Black women from the Portland, Oregon, area alleged the rental site’s use of names and photographs allowed for racial discrimination, violating the state’s public accommodation laws. The suit was settled in 2019, and starting on 31 January, Airbnb announced this week, hosts in Oregon will only see a guest’s initials until their booking is confirmed, only after which their full name will be visible. The update will be in effect for at least two years, the company said. “As part of our ongoing work, we will take any learnings from this process and use them to inform future efforts to fight bias,” the company added. Complaints about discrimination on Airbnb aren’t new. In 2015 and 2016, the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack circulated, highlighting racism experienced by some of the platform’s users. Many Black users discussed being denied bookings until they changed their names online or used generic profile photos. Some even found that using photos of white individuals could game the system. A study conducted by Harvard Business School researchers in 2016 affirmed these stories through data. After studying 6,400 Airbnb listings in five American cities, the study concluded that “requests from guests with distinctively African American names are roughly 16% less likely to be accepted than identical guests with distinctively white names”. Advocates called the Oregon policy change a good start, but cautioned that the adjustment shouldn’t be heralded as the end of racism on Airbnb. “We believe that measuring discrimination is crucial to eliminating it, and we think all tech companies should take responsibility for that,” said Johnny Mathias, deputy senior campaign director at the racial justice organization Color of Change. In order to know if changes are meaningful, Mathias continued, companies should measure the outcomes and be transparent with their findings. In other words, making a gesture without numbers to back up its efficacy is not useful. “I’m glad that Oregon has specific public accommodation laws that provided for this suit,” he added. “But whether this specific change is the most important change to ensure [they’re] addressing discrimination on the Airbnb platform, we’ll only know if we see the research.” As with most emerging tech platforms, rules and regulations are often playing catch-up with the technologies they’re supposed to govern. In their study, the Harvard researchers noted that anti-discrimination housing laws that hold sway over traditional landlords – such as those renting large apartment buildings – are often lost on the smaller-scale landlords who use Airbnb. Airbnb has resisted doing away with names and photos altogether, arguing that they add to the sense of community on the site. But the company has taken some steps to fight the bias on its platform. In 2018, it announced that it would hide guests’ profile photos until after their booking was accepted. It also requires that all hosts and guests to agree to the Airbnb Community Commitment, “which requires everyone who uses Airbnb to treat others without discrimination and with respect”. And in 2020, Airbnb launched Project Lighthouse, an initiative created to measure bias on its own platform, with Color of Change and other civil rights organizations.;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/03/airbnb-race-oregon-names-discrimination
5721;5721;‘I saw a big set of white teeth coming towards me’: the people who survived terrifying wild animal attacks;2022-01-04T06:00:08Z;['Ammar Kalia'];['Wildlife', 'Animals', 'Life and style', 'Health', 'Society', 'World news'];"Although, mercifully, still rare, there are signs that wild animal attacks on humans are increasing. Research from the scientific journal Nature found that, as our urban areas further expand into the territories of carnivorous animals, attacks on pets, livestock and sometimes humans have been on the rise. In Kashmir, local wildlife departments have been reporting a marked increase in attacks, with almost 200 people killed and more than 2,000 others wounded in man-animal conflict in the region since 2011. From a British citizen attacked by otters in Singapore, to monkey attacks in Thailand, squirrel attacks in New York, and a man who fought off a crocodile with a pocket knife in Queensland, these encounters capture our imaginations. But how does it feel to survive such an ordeal – and how does it affect your life?
‘I tried to punch the mountain lion in the face’ – Anne Hjelle, 48, Orange County, California One day in January 2004, I texted my biking friend Debi to see if she wanted to meet for a ride. I live in California and wanted to do a 45-minute loop at Whiting Ranch, which was only a 10-minute drive from my house. I left my groceries on the counter at home. It was about 3.45pm when we started. I was coming around a blind corner and saw a man in the middle of the trail with another bike propped up against the bushes. I slowed down and asked if everything was OK. He said he had found an abandoned bike and was looking for the owner. Debi and I continued, trying to pick up speed. A minute later, I came to a twisty section, bordered by thick brush and a slope down to a ravine. In my peripheral vision I suddenly saw this flash of reddish-brown fur. I knew it was an animal, but my first assumption was that it was a deer, since they would sometimes bound across the trail. In the next second, the animal leapt and grabbed me. There’s only one animal that would attempt that; I knew it was a mountain lion. It latched on to my shoulders and tried to bite down on the back of my neck. It felt like getting hit by a truck. I was slammed to the ground and it knocked the wind out of me; I could not believe this was happening.
The cat started to drag me down into the ravine. It had me by the back of the neck and I tried to punch its face but it didn’t have any effect. It dragged me several feet and then readjusted its grip to over my left ear and then the left side of my face. I realised that it was working its way around to the front of my neck. At this point, I was trying to scream for Debi and I saw her – she was screaming, too, and in a tug of war with the cat over me. It had me by the head and she grabbed me by my calf to try to keep it from pulling me down into the ravine. Meanwhile, it closed its grip on the left side of my face and pulled my cheek away. It was like a hot knife through butter. I started to say goodbye to Debi as it tried to grab the front of my throat. Within a matter of seconds, things began to go black. I was convinced this was the end of my life. I just felt peace. But Debi’s screams had brought other riders over to us. One went back to call the emergency services and two others started throwing rocks at the cat. They hit it three times – and when one landed on its head, it let go of me. Shortly after that, I came to. I remember being very shocked that I had woken up – and that the cat was gone. I was choking on my own blood and it felt as if I was drowning. The left side of my face felt like someone had stapled a steak to it. My next concern was whether I could see out of my left eye. When I realised I could, that was the first moment I thought I was going to be OK. It took 19 minutes from the 911 call until the paramedics arrived. When the helicopter was flying overhead, the pilot saw the cat crouched down, waiting for another chance. The sheriff’s deputies later found a body that was identified as Mark Reynolds. He was killed earlier by the cat – the abandoned bike was his.
Without Debi stepping in, I would not be here. Mark was a high-level athlete and he did not survive because he was by himself. People have no clue how powerful these animals are – it was like being mobbed by 10 people. That night, I went into surgery for six-and-a-half hours. My trauma surgeon later said that my injuries were the worst he had ever seen. But I was lucky – out of the 20 deep puncture wounds I sustained, none hit my trachea, oesophagus, voice box or carotid artery. My doctors said it was a miracle. I got back on a bike only four months later. I got friends together and went to ride that same trail. Either I let the fear control me or I take control; I wanted to check it off the list and move on. I’ve had zero issues with nightmares or PTSD since the attack. I am just so thankful to be alive. I don’t let this attack define me. I now have a daughter, who is eight, and I try to be strong and set an example for her.
‘I grabbed the shark in a bear hug to stop it biting me’ – Rodney Fox, 81, Adelaide At 22, I was the winner of the South Australian spearfishing championships, holding your breath and spearing a variety of fish under a time limit. I was trying to regain my title in 1963, off Aldinga beach. After three or four hours, I needed to catch some special species, so I swam a long way offshore, where none of the other competitors had been, and dived to the bottom. I was just about to pull the trigger on a really prized fish when a huge crash hit me in the side. It knocked the gun out of my hands and the mask off my face and I was dragged through the water faster than I’d ever swam before.
I initially thought I’d been hit by a submarine, but then I realised it had to be a giant shark – a great white. Fortunately, I had been talking to a guy who had been bitten on the leg a year earlier, and we had worked out that the most vulnerable spot on the shark was its eyes. So I gouged around its head trying to get the shark to let go of me. And it did. I fell out of its mouth and I instinctively thrusted away with my hand, but that went into its mouth and tore on its teeth. I then grabbed the shark in a bear hug around the belly because I knew it wouldn’t be able to bite me there. I was 30 or 40ft underwater and I realised I was going to drown if I didn’t move. So I let go and kicked up to the surface, then I looked down through the blood red water and saw this big set of white teeth coming back towards me. I kicked as hard as I could at the shark but I only just touched it. Instead, it turned and swallowed the float that I had tied my fish to. That float was connected to my lead belt by a rope and that caught on the shark’s teeth. It dragged me underwater again. I knew I had to find the quick release for the belt, but my hands were all cut up. I was within split seconds of drowning when the shark pulled, the line snapped and I managed to thrash to the surface. Miraculously, a boat was on its way over to have a look at all this red water and the people on board pulled me in. The fear of dying overrides pain. It was only when I was lying down on the boat that the waves of pain arrived. I knew I had done my best – now it was up to my rescuers to try to save me. In those days, there was no microsurgery, so they put 29 stitches in my lung to close up the pleural sac, and every rib on my left side was broken. I had 462 stitches in my chest in total, since all of my organs were exposed and my torso was ripped open. Doctors said it was the worst shark attack they had seen. Just seven months after the attack, I was at Adelaide zoo looking at a lion’s cage. I had this idea that I could build a cage underwater and reverse the roles. I would look at these sharks and try to understand them, and then see if I wanted to go back to diving. In 1964, I managed to organise an expedition with two other shark-attack survivors. The sharks were more interested in the bait than us, and I started to realise that maybe the sharks weren’t going to attack us every time we went in the water. A lot of people would say the best sharks are dead sharks, but I knew there was already lots of blood in the water from the speared fish, so I don’t blame the shark for coming and biting something. Over the years, it’s been a huge battle trying to get people to understand sharks better. We have to learn not to kill them from fear. A year and a half after the attack, I entered the Australian spearfishing championships and came first in several events. I’m 81 now and it hasn’t given me any real problems, except that I have a tight feeling in the left side of my chest to remind me how lucky I was. I’ve been running expeditions for people to watch sharks in their habitats ever since.
‘The otter kept torpedoing underwater to bite my legs ’ – Leah Hiller, 42, Minnesota My dad owns a cabin in a remote area on Island Lake, Minnesota, where we would often spend holidays. In July 2012, when I was 31, I was staying there while training for the USA Triathlon National Championships. My husband and two children, who were four and two at the time, were with me. One morning, I went for my usual mile-long swim. I’d done it 100 times before and my dad was going to take my kids out to follow me on his pontoon boat. Everything was going great until my kids said they wanted to be taken back to eat some snacks. I told my dad it was fine for him to go, since there was no boat traffic. In Island Lake, the water is the colour of dark rum, so when your hand passes into it, you can’t see past your elbow. You don’t know what is beneath. I circled the island in the lake and was on my way back to shore when I was bitten on the heel. It was a really sharp pain. At first, I thought it was a muskie, which are these huge fish that populate the lake, but they’re not known to be violent. Then I was attacked on the calf. Something grabbed my leg and just started biting. I was in real pain and my mind was in shock. About 20ft away, a head popped out to look at me and I realised it was an otter.
I’m an animal lover and had never thought otters would attack anyone. Over the next 10 minutes, I was yelling and calling for help. The otter kept torpedoing underwater to bite my legs and then it would come up, track where I was, and attack again. I knew I couldn’t outswim it, so I just had to brace for the bites and try to protect my neck because, if it hit me there, I would have drowned. These sharp, searing bites were coming from every angle and it bit me 25 times. Some of them were two inches deep and one pierced my ankle bone, while another went through my calf muscle. But I am no stranger to adversity. When I was 18 I survived a car crash where I was sent flying through the windscreen. I spent six months in the hospital and had to have multiple surgeries. When I was 23, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and had to have my lymph nodes removed. I believe these experiences helped me – I knew I had to fight. I kept on screaming and eventually my dad heard me. He was so panicked he flooded the motor of the pontoon boat trying to start it. He had to get to his other boat, which luckily did start, and he made it to me and pulled me out of the water. He couldn’t leave my kids alone, so they were in the boat, too, and my daughter was bawling at seeing her mum covered in blood. Even though I was in pain, I switched into mum mode and was comforting her. I knew, now I was out of the water, I would be fine. It must have been 10 to 15 minutes before my dad got out to me, and without him it could have gone on for a lot longer because there were no other boats nearby. My wetsuit was a saviour – that quarter inch of neoprene took a lot of the scratches and it was shredded. The blood was streaming under it. We went straight to the hospital where the doctors were worried that the otter might have rabies. Since I had 25 open wounds, I had to get a rabies shot in each of them – it was so much medication that I threw up everywhere. The first thing I asked when I stopped vomiting was, “When can I get back in the lake?” The doctors thought it was crazy, but I knew that if I could not get back in the water and face my fear, I would never want to again. I was given a two-week course of antibiotics and after that I was told I would be good to go. There was a triathlon happening about two weeks later and I knew that would be my way to get back in. I did it in a wetsuit that said “otter girl” on the back. I still swim now. I’m proud of that otter attack story because it showed me how mentally strong I can be. That otter still lives, too. No one knows why it attacked me, but the doctors guessed that it must have been a mother otter protecting its babies. My dad would see it swimming around for years afterwards – I just don’t think anyone else swam in that spot again.
‘The grizzly bear carried me 30ft in its mouth’ – Colin Dowler, 47, Vancouver Island In summer 2019, I was exploring potential hiking routes to climb Mount Doogie Dowler in British Columbia. I was cycling down a narrow logging path when I came around a corner and spotted a grizzly bear. I had seen two or three black bears before and, usually, if you make some noise, they move away. But this was the first time I had seen a grizzly – and it was staring at me. I got off my bike, since it wasn’t moving. I was peering out of the corner of my eye and noticed it slinking towards me, until it was only a couple of feet away. It had almost cleared past my bike – until it made a 180-degree turn towards me. I spun around to put the bike between us and got my hiking pole out as it moved closer, placing it between its eyes. It pushed back a little and that seemed like a decent stalemate until it rolled its head, bit on to the pole and tossed it away. I took off my bag and threw it to the side – I thought it would go for the food in there instead of me. It took a sniff but then started prodding me with its paw. Each poke got a little more aggressive until it lifted its paw high. I thought it would inflict some serious damage so I threw my bike at it.
It lunged forward and sank its teeth between my ribs and hips on my left side and soon I was in the bear’s mouth as it carried me 30 or 40ft towards a bush. I was in crushing pain. It put me down and I tried to gouge at its eyes but I couldn’t reach. I was thrashing while it pinned me and started biting and tearing at my thigh. It was so painful it felt like my hip was going to dislocate. It excavated into my thigh so far I could hear its teeth grinding against my femur like a dog chewing a bone. I started saying goodbye to my wife and kids in my head and felt guilty that I’d even taken this trip in the first place. Then I realised I had a pocket knife. I had to use both hands while I was still pinned down but I eventually managed to get it out. The blade was under three inches long but I gave the bear a stab in its neck with all the energy I had. When I pulled the knife out, it lifted its head up and a big gush of blood splashed on to my waist. It got off me and walked to my bike, sniffed at it for a while and then stood back at the bush where it had stepped out from. I knew I had to move fast otherwise I’d bleed to death. While the bear was still watching, I cut the sleeve off my shirt and made a tourniquet for my left leg. I looked over again and the bear had gone. It was 12.01pm and I knew there wouldn’t be any loggers here until later in the afternoon. So, I dragged myself to my bicycle, gathered my wits and started pedalling with one leg for about 45 minutes until I finally saw a loggers’ cabin. The door was open and I crashed into their stairwell, yelling for help. Thank God there were five guys there who seemed panicked but got their first aid kits out and called 911 while patching my 60 puncture wounds up. One wound was so big that my kidney was visible. An air ambulance came about an hour later; they gave me two pints of blood on the cabin floor and then flew me to hospital for six-and-a-half-hour surgery. The next day, I began 40 days of recovery at Vancouver general hospital. They had me back up and walking 24 days after the attack and, by January 2020, the specialists were seeing some nerve regeneration in my left leg. By February, I began jogging on a treadmill. In September, I ran a half marathon. Mentally, it was a lot harder than I thought it would be getting back into the woods. I made a conscious effort to walk in the bush behind my house as soon as I could so I wouldn’t be overwhelmed by fear. I used tactics to help me, like playing music in headphones to drown out the noise of critters moving around. I have since bumped into a few black bears on the trails, too, but I yell and they get out of the way.
‘The hippo was thrashing me around like a toy’ – Kristen Yaldor, 41, Odessa, Florida My husband, Ryan, and I decided to go to Victoria Falls for my 37th birthday in 2018, and take a canoe trip down the Zambezi River on the day itself. The weather was great and the temperature was perfect. As far as safety was concerned, the guides just said that if you fall out, swim to shore as fast as you can. We brushed it off – we’re from Florida and are used to being on the water, so we didn’t think we’d fall out. There were three canoes in total – the first one had a guide and another tourist, the second canoe was myself with Ryan in the back, and the third was another guide. We were only around the corner from where we had launched when a guide told us that he had seen a group of hippos ahead, so we should head to the bank. We were paddling left and I glanced over to look for them. I saw one submerged – and as we paddled a few more strokes, it came under our canoe. It leapt up and forced us out, bending the canoe with a big thud.
I fell forward towards where the hippo was and Ryan fell backwards towards the bank. We had lifejackets on so I quickly popped back to the surface. I started swimming, but after a few strokes it grabbed my leg and pulled me straight down. I was only about six strokes from the shore. My first instinct was to reach for the sky to see if my hands would break the surface and when I just felt more water, that’s when I went into survival mode. Just before I went down I had instinctively taken a deep breath and I told myself to hold it and stay calm. As soon as the hippo dragged me to the bottom, it started thrashing me around like a toy. I bunched up around its snout and tried to pry its mouth open. I knew I wasn’t strong enough to, but it must have got freaked by me grabbing it, or my staying still made it think I was dead, since it then, surprisingly, let go. Because I was wearing a lifejacket, I popped back up to the surface, but I couldn’t swim. I couldn’t kick my leg and I thought I had broken my knee. I yelled to everyone on the shore and started back stroking with my arms before reaching for the guide’s paddle, and was pulled out. I think the whole episode only lasted about 45 seconds but, from Ryan’s account, when he came up to shore and looked back, he saw nothing. Even though I was being thrashed around underwater, there was no surface movement, I was just gone. My entire trouser leg and the skin on my thigh and knee were ripped apart. I could see my muscle, and a chunk of it was sitting on top of my leg. We waited 45 minutes for a helicopter to come and take us to the local hospital. They prepped me there and then we waited for an emergency flight to take us back to the trauma centre in Johannesburg. My femur was broken and I also needed a skin graft. I spent two weeks in the Johannesburg hospital before taking a medical flight home to finish the remaining procedures. I have had 21 surgeries to date and I don’t know if it’s because nerves were severed, but I have had hardly any pain throughout. I’m very determined. I didn’t ever think I wouldn’t be able to walk again. My husband signed me up for a charity 5k run when I wasn’t even able to walk, knowing that I’m goal-oriented. I told him that if I was able to achieve it, he would need to dress up as a hippo and come with me. Even though I couldn’t run, we took part in 2019. After that, we signed up for a 10k, which we completed in November, and in January we’re doing a half marathon. The attack was so instantaneous that I didn’t properly see the hippo. I haven’t been haunted by PTSD. My struggle has been to get over the muscle loss and to walk again. I’m almost there now, and I’ve just finished physical therapy. I know I’m going to be working on it for the rest of my life but that’s OK. At least I’m still here and doing the things that I want to do. I just won’t go back canoeing on the Zambezi again.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/04/saw-big-set-of-white-teeth-coming-towards-me-people-who-survived-wild-animal-attacks
5722;5722;Holmes verdict an indictment of Silicon Valley’s ‘fake it till you make it’ ethos;2022-01-04T06:00:07Z;['Kari Paul'];['Theranos', 'Technology', 'US news', 'California', 'Silicon Valley'];"Elizabeth Holmes, founder of the blood testing company Theranos, has been found guilty on four charges of fraud – a verdict that will probably land her in prison and have major implications for Silicon Valley. Holmes was acquitted on three charges relating to patients who received inaccurate test results but found guilty on four charges, including one count of conspiracy to defraud investors and three counts of wire fraud against investors. The jury remained deadlocked on three of the charges.
The split verdicts are “a mixed bag for the prosecution, but it’s a loss for Elizabeth Holmes because she is going away to prison for at least a few years”, said David Ring, a lawyer who has followed the case closely. It also marks a milestone for Silicon Valley – an industry that has for years evaded accountability in its pervasive culture of “fake it till you make it” that encourages founders to make big promises, often with little proof. “Silicon Valley has thus far been famously been resistant to much prosecutorial activity because its business model assumes you are going to take an aggressive, optimistic view of your product or service to attract investors,” said Jack Sharman, a white-collar defense lawyer at Lightfoot, a law firm in Alabama. “And if that product or service succeeds, you’re not a fraudster, you’re a visionary,” he added. Theranos sold a promise to improve health with tests on one drop of blood – a claim that despite having little scientific proof raised hundreds of millions of dollars and attracted big-name investors such as the media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the former secretary of state Henry Kissinger. The Theranos verdict could cause startups to tread more carefully in the future, said Neama Rahmani, a former former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers. “In Silicon Valley, this conviction will resonate with the big law firms that advise startup companies,” he said. “Attorneys are going to be advising their clients to be more careful, especially in what they say to investors.” The Silicon Valley investor Jason Calacanis, who was an early backer of major firms like Uber and Robinhood, said the verdict was a “reminder to founders”. “Never lie, never bend the truth, always be honest about where you are at with your traction, especially when raising money,” he tweeted. Greater whistleblower power The verdict could also mark a new era for workers in technology, who are increasingly speaking out against their powerful employers. Throughout the trial, former employees of the company testified they long suspected Theranos could not deliver on its promises, but felt they could not raise questions. Tyler Shultz, a witness in the trial and early Theranos whistleblower, said on Monday he hoped the verdict encouraged others to speak out against corporate wrongdoing. “This has been a long chapter of my life,” he said. “I am happy that justice has been served and that this saga is finally in my rearview mirror.” He also highlighted Erika Cheung, another whistleblower and former employee at Theranos who spoke out against the company’s deceptive business practices. “Proud of the impact that Erika and I had,” he added. “Hope to inspire other young professionals to hold their leaders accountable.” Experts said the verdict showed that the decision to put Holmes on the stand – a major gamble made by the defense – did not play in the founder’s favor. This could set a precedent for fraud cases in the future, said the Los Angeles criminal appeals attorney Matthew Barhoma. “This jury did not fall for it and ultimately that points to why it’s generally best for defendants to avoid testifying in their own defense,” he said. “If a master manipulator like Holmes can fail to convince a jury, what chance does the average defendant have?” What happens next for Holmes? A hearing has been set for next week during which the prosecutors will reveal whether they plan to retry Holmes on the three charges the jury could not decide. Such a retrial is “not very likely”, Sharman said, as the convictions already carry considerable sentencing time. “I would expect them to declare victory,” he said of prosecutors, noting that Holmes was already decisively convicted on hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud charges. Holmes walked out of the courthouse on Monday after parties agreed she would not be taken into custody until her sentencing hearing. That date will be set at the hearing regarding the retrial next week. With no prior convictions, Holmes is unlikely to face the maximum prison time her charges carry, which is 20 years, said Rahmani, and she will probably face just several years in prison and more on probation. Still, Holmes is almost certain to appeal. “She’s not someone who is going to want to do even five months in prison, much less five years,” he said.

5723;5723;Explanation for Liz Truss’s £3,000 lunch in doubt, says Labour;2022-01-04T06:00:07Z;['Peter Walker'];['Liz Truss', 'Politics', 'International trade', 'Conservatives', 'Labour', 'UK news'];"Labour has called on the government to explain why it claimed Liz Truss hosted a £3,000 lunch at a private members’ club because it was available at short notice, when correspondence later showed that she had insisted on the venue. In a letter to the international trade minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Labour also asked why Truss, Trevelyan’s predecessor in the role, had overruled civil servants’ concerns about the cost of the members’ club, owned by a Tory donor. The correspondence, disclosed by the Sunday Times, showed that Truss, now the foreign secretary and a favourite to succeed Boris Johnson, “refused to consider anywhere else” and asked that public funds should pay for the event with Joe Biden’s trade representative. According to the correspondence, Truss, then the trade secretary, “explicitly asked that we book 5 Hertford Street”, owned by Robin Birley, a £20,000 donor to Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign and the half-brother of Zac Goldsmith, the environment minister. The venue agreed to reduce the bill to £1,400, but on condition of immediate payment – which meant civil servants had to use an emergency process to pay up straight away. In the letter to Trevelyan, Labour’s shadow international trade secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said that when the Mail on Sunday asked about the event in November, “it is understood that the department’s own press office stated that the reason for such expense was due to it being organised at ‘short notice’ and therefore down to availability”. He continued: “However, in correspondence it showcases that it was not down to short notice, but the insistency of the former secretary of state.” As well as seeking clarification on this, the letter asks Trevelyan when she learned of the dinner, why the venue was chosen and why Truss overruled civil servants, and whether the club had been used for other events. “These revelations showcase the complete lack of transparency and accountability of such decisions,” Thomas-Symonds wrote. “What we see from this government is a flagrant abuse of the powers that have been given to them.” Before attending the event with US trade representatives, a civil servant described the club as “obviously incredibly expensive and more than I understand we’d usually expect to pay for such a venue”. It was requested, the official wrote, as the private dining room was “of the appropriate size and standing”. Truss and her companions drank two measures of dry gin; three bottles of Pazo Barrantes Albariño, a Spanish white wine, costing a total of £153; and two bottles of the French red Coudoulet de Beaucastel, costing a total of £130, it was reported. Department for International Trade officials argue that the booking was made at short notice, just a day before the event, and that alternative venues might not have been cheaper. A spokesperson for the department said: “This was a diplomatic working dinner attended by the previous international trade secretary, senior UK officials, and US counterparts from our largest single trading partner.” • This article was amended on 4 January 2022 to correct details of the drinks reportedly ordered at 5 Hertford Street. An earlier version also erroneously said the Truss correspondence was obtained by the Sunday Times in a “leak”.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/04/leak-casts-doubt-on-explanation-for-liz-trusss-3000-lunch-says-labour
5724;5724;Tesla criticised for opening showroom in Xinjiang despite human rights abuses;2022-01-04T05:38:46Z;['Helen Davidson'];['Xinjiang', 'Tesla', 'China', 'Uyghurs', 'Asia Pacific', 'Business', 'Elon Musk', 'International trade', 'Global economy'];"Tesla has opened a new showroom in the capital of Xinjiang, a region at the heart of years-long campaign by Chinese authorities of repression and assimilation against the Uyghur people. Tesla announced the opening in Urumqi with a Weibo post on 31 December saying: “On the last day of 2021, we meet in Xinjiang. In 2022 let us together launch Xinjiang on its electric journey!” The post was accompanied by photos of the opening festivities including people holding placards which read “Tesla [heart] Xinjiang”. The US has enacted a range of sanctions and regulatory and other measures against China over its continuing human rights abuses in Xinjiang, including restrictions on US business dealings with local operators and suppliers.
President Joe Biden last month signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, and the US government intends to conduct a diplomatic boycott of the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics. Uyghur rights groups criticised the opening of the showroom, reportedly Tesla’s 211th in China. The Council on American-Islamic Relations urged its immediate closure, and the cessation of what it alleged “amounts to economic support for genocide”. “No American corporation should be doing business in a region that is the focal point of a campaign of genocide targeting a religious and ethnic minority,” said the council’s director of national communications, Ibrahim Hooper. Human Rights Watch’s Australia researcher, Sophie McNeill, said: “Beijing and businesses have long banked on a global willingness to put profits ahead of human rights, even in the face of crimes against humanity, but we must not allow this to continue in 2022. “Elon Musk and his Tesla executives need to consider human rights in Xinjiang or risk being complicit.” Tesla has been contacted for comment. Tesla’s decision drew some support on Chinese social media, and followed revelations a week earlier that US tech company Intel had requested suppliers not to source goods, services, or labour from the region. One commenter welcomed Tesla’s support for “the development and construction of Xinjiang, unlike some other companies”, an apparent reference to multinationals seeking to reduce business links with Xinjiang over the rights abuses. Last month Intel was accused by state media of offending the Chinese market after it wrote to suppliers requesting they avoid using “any labor or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region”, citing restrictions imposed by multiple governments. After a backlash the company published a letter to “deeply apologise for the confusion”, saying the request was a matter of compliance with US law and didn’t represent its stance on Xinjiang.
Commercial operations in China have become fraught as international brands come under increasing pressure to cut ties with Xinjiang suppliers if they can’t guarantee the absence of forced labour or other abuses. Companies including H&M and Intel have been widely criticised or threatened with boycotts in China over their decisions to distance the brand from Xinjiang labour and products. Case studies of such mass online reactions have found the nationalistic backlash is often driven or amplified by Chinese state media and state-linked social media accounts. Xinjiang is the site of a long campaign of forced assimilation by Chinese authorities against ethnic minorities including Muslim Uyghurs. As many as one million people are estimated to have been detained in mass detention and reeducation centres, and the broader population subjected to suppression of religious and cultural activity, intense surveillance and policing, alleged forced labour programs and enforced birth control. Governments including the US have declared the campaign to be genocide, while several human rights and legal groups have said the actions amount to crimes against humanity. Beijing denies all accusations of human rights abuses, and says its policies are part of anti-terrorism efforts and poverty alleviation programs.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/tesla-criticised-for-opening-showroom-in-xinjiang-despite-human-rights-abuses
5725;5725;Detained, missing, close to death: the toll of reporting on Covid in China;2022-01-04T05:30:07Z;['Helen Davidson'];['China', 'Coronavirus', 'Asia Pacific', 'Infectious diseases', 'Science', 'Media', 'Journalist safety', 'Newspapers', 'World news', 'Newspapers & magazines'];"Chen Kun was living in Indonesia with his wife and daughter when he learned from his brother Mei’s boss that he had been “taken away for investigation” by Chinese police. He immediately suspected it was to do with his brother’s website, a citizen news project called Terminus 2049. Since 2018 Mei, his colleague Cai Wei, and Cai’s partner – surnamed Tang – had been archiving articles about issues including #MeToo and migrant rights, and reposting them whenever they were deleted from China’s strictly monitored and censored online platforms. It was April 2020, and for the last few months Terminus 2049 had been targeting stories about the Covid-19 outbreak and response. In an interview with the Guardian from his home in France, Chen recalled warning his shy but passionate younger brother about setting up such a website, but thinking the worst case scenario was that Mei would be “invited to drink tea”, a euphemism for interrogation by security agencies, not arrested. Instead Mei and Cai spent almost 16 months in detention. Tang was released in May, when the other two were convicted at a trial which Chen said lasted just 100 minutes. Mei and Cai were sentenced to 15 months jail and released in August on time served. Mei is potentially still under surveillance. The group is on a growing list of journalists and others who have been arrested and detained by Chinese authorities, often without trial, in a crackdown that appeared to escalate during the pandemic. In December a report by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) detailed a worsening “nightmare” for journalists under the rule of Xi Jinping, with 128 known to be behind bars or disappeared. More than 70 are Uyghur journalists, and at least 10 people were arrested for reporting on the Covid outbreak and lockdown in Wuhan. Chen said it was a sign of how sensitive Chinese authorities were and remain about the pandemic and its origins. “I’m sure the reason why my brother was arrested was because of Covid,” Chen said. “Before his arrest … they didn’t encounter any problems.” ‘A war on independent journalism’ Mei was formally arrested for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, a vague and ubiquitous charge frequently levelled at dissidents, activists and journalists, and sent to residential surveillance in a designated location (RSDL) – China’s increasingly utilised form of secretive and solitary detention where the accused can be held for up to six months and interrogated without charge, or access to lawyers or family. The rights group Safeguard Defenders estimates between 45,000 and 55,000 people have been sent to RSDL, including about 15,000 in 2020. Among them have been Mei, the Australian CGTN anchor Cheng Lei, the journalist Sophia Huang Xueqin and the activist Wang Jianbing. Mei and his Terminus 2049 colleagues were freed in August, and he is living at home in China. Chen is still advocating for those still detained, particularly Huang, and says that neither his brother nor their parents are aware of his campaigning.
As well as reporting on the #MeToo movement and the Hong Kong protests – the latter for which she was detained for three months in 2019 – Huang had also interviewed Chen and written about Mei. “She was always trying to record the stories and experiences of a lot of people like my brother, about defenders,” Chen said. The independent investigative journalist has not been seen since she and Wang were arrested in September on the eve of her planned departure to study in Europe. In October her parents were told she had been formally arrested for “subverting state power”. Also subject to human rights campaigns is Zhang Zhan, a former lawyer turned citizen reporter, who last Christmas was sentenced to four years in jail over 122 videos she posted online and interviews she gave to foreign press during 14 weeks in Wuhan. Deep into a lengthy hunger strike, which no friends or family can convince her to stop, Zhang is close to death, her family says. While human rights observers, legal groups, and media organisations maintain she should never have been convicted in the first place, an international campaign is urgently calling for her release on any grounds possible, to save her life.
Feng Bin, who like Zhang broadcast reports on YouTube from Wuhan, has not been seen since his arrest in February 2020, and Li Zehu, who broadcast the police chase which led to his arrest around the same time, was detained for two months. Chen Qiushi, a former human rights lawyer turned citizen journalist, reported from Wuhan’s hospitals interviewing families, disappeared at the same time and didn’t reappear until September. In February 2020 Cheng Lei, an anchor for Chinese state broadcaster CGTN, posted on Facebook that she and her friend Haze Fan, a Bloomberg news assistant, had been unsuccessfully lobbying to report from Wuhan. In August Cheng was detained and later charged with “illegally supplying state secrets overseas”. Fan was detained in December. Both remain in detention more than a year later. Cedric Alviari, RSF’s east Asia bureau director, said the 128 detained journalists and press freedom defenders is the biggest count in five years. It includes 71 Uyghur journalists, and at least 10 who face impending death if not immediately released, according to RSF. Alviari said the crackdown is driven by Xi, who has “declared a war on independent journalism” after tightening controls on traditional media. “Everything he and the CCP have been doing over the past eight years … has been to suppress independent voices.,” he said. “The Chinese people, like every person on earth, crave information on what’s happening around them.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/detained-missing-close-to-death-toll-reporting-covid-china
5726;5726;Country diary: Money spiders, everywhere, more than I have ever seen before ;2022-01-04T05:30:07Z;['Mark Cocker'];['Environment', 'Rural affairs', 'UK news'];"A moist airstream surging through the cold massif of the Peak District deposited ground fog over mid-Derbyshire. Just to the west, however, at the county boundary with Staffordshire, and before the world fell away to mist-enshrouded flatlands about Leek, there was a band of high country held in piercing sunlight. What little warmth fired down at this place then rebounded off the bare gritstone ridges, so that the air around the Roaches actually felt hot. Perhaps it was these conditions, in a context of otherwise absolute winter stillness, that gave rise to the day’s wildlife drama. For in the fields, and in an eddy of slow-rising warmth drifting toward the hill known as Hen Cloud, there unfolded a remarkable abundance of spiders. Initially I noticed it as strands of white wafting thread, wound around the roof edge, walls, gates and fence posts near the cafe at this spot. Then I began to feel strands of cottony stuff in my eyes. Looking down, I could see a million silvery pixels glistening in wavy lines among the fields.
There were spiders everywhere: on fence tops, on stone figures in the cafe garden, on dead plants, bushes, running through my hair and across my cheek. On one post I counted 15. But the deepest insight into overall numbers came when I ran binoculars from the ground into the middle sky. The air had become a visible fluid made almost liquid by snaking, lifting lengths of silk. I’ve never seen anything like it. There must have been millions of money spiders, probably in the family Linyphiidae, dispersing in response to their high densities at source in a technique known as “ballooning”. The drag of air through the silk is greater than the weight of its maker, and the spider is carried aloft to pastures new. Who knows where it might settle? Silk strands have been recorded at elevations of 6,000m. When Krakatoa erupted in 1883 and punished the whole world with a summer of ashy skies and plunging temperatures, the first to plant a flag for life on that dead volcano was a spider on its magical silk carpet. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/04/country-diary-money-spiders-everywhere-more-than-i-have-ever-seen-before
5727;5727;New Zealand Covid experts take legal action against employer over alleged failure to protect them from abuse;2022-01-04T05:21:56Z;['Helen Livingstone'];['New Zealand', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news', 'Coronavirus'];Two of New Zealand’s most prominent Covid experts are taking legal action against their employer, the University of Auckland, over what they say is its failure to respond adequately to “harassment from a small but venomous sector of the public” that is becoming “more extreme”. Siouxsie Wiles, an associate professor of medical science, and Shaun Hendy, a professor of physics, have filed separate complaints to the Employment Relations Authority, which last week ruled that they should proceed directly to the Employment Court due to the “high public interest” in their Covid commentary. According to the ruling, the scientists say that as a result of their work they have “suffered vitriolic, unpleasant, and deeply personalised threats and harassment” via email, social media and video sharing platforms which has had a “detrimental impact” on their physical safety as well as their mental health. The determination also noted that Wiles had also been the victim of doxxing – in which personal information is published about a person online – while Hendy has been physically confronted at his university office by a person who threatened to “see him soon”. The pair say that they are expected to provide public commentary as part of their jobs and that it is “consistent with the principle of academic freedom” but that the university had “failed to take proactive action to protect them” from abuse and that it had “failed to take all reasonable steps to provide a safe working environment”. Wiles, who is known for her trademark pink hair, was named New Zealander of the Year last year for her work on explaining the science behind the Covid-19 pandemic, including everything from how the virus spreads to how vaccines work. Her collaborations with cartoonist Toby Morris for The Spinoff website were widely shared and resulted in work for the World Health Organization. Hendy’s expertise in data-modelling has been credited with shaping the country’s pandemic response. The Employment Relations Authority determination said the issue of their safety had first been raised in early 2020 shortly after the pandemic began but Wiles and Hendy claim the steps taken to protect them were “inadequate” and not consistent with the university’s contractual and statutory obligations and had resulted in “ongoing unjustified disadvantage”. The scientists, who say they had been asked by both the university and the prime minister’s office to provide Covid commentary, claim that in a letter sent in August, the university urged them to cut back on their public comments and suggested they take paid leave in order to“minimise any social media comment”. The university denies unjustifiably disadvantaging the scientists or breaching its statutory obligations and said they were neither expected or required to provide comment on Covid as part of their jobs, adding that much of their public commentary had been undertaken in a private capacity. It also said that it had responded “appropriately” to Wiles’ and Hendy’s concerns and denied telling them to keep their public comments to a minimum. It said it had “merely advised the applicants that doing so is an option they may want to consider”. The Employment Relations Authority said the matter should be resolved as quickly as possible by the court – rather than going through the authority’s sometimes lengthy and potentially more costly process – due to the high public interest in their commentary. It also noted, “the authority is concerned about the uncontested evidence that the harassment is escalating and is expected to continue to do so. The issues associated with the vaccination of children aged 5-11 years of age is already a topic that has stirred up increased vitriol towards the applicants.”;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/new-zealand-covid-experts-take-legal-action-against-employer-over-alleged-failure-to-protect-them-from-abuse
5728;5728;A crisis of faith in South Africa: ‘People have given up on the state’;2022-01-04T05:00:06Z;['Jason Burke'];['South Africa', 'Africa', 'World news', 'Coronavirus'];"One evening a week, Natasha Msweswe and Zanele Madasi leave their children at home and set out to patrol the streets of Thembokwezi. They return at midnight. This is potentially very dangerous but they feel they have little choice. “It can be scary but we want to protect our community,” said Madasi, 31. “We want to make a difference.” Thembokwezi is a neighbourhood of Khayelitsha, a sprawling, overcrowded township overlooked by Table Mountain that has long been infamous for high levels of gang violence, drug abuse and unemployment. South African police are stretched very thin and so a network of neighbourhood watch organisations play a key role in fighting crime here. Thembokwezi is more prosperous and safer than much of the rest of the township, and those who live here want to keep it that way. “We work with the police of course … but if we fold our arms as a community, the criminals will run amok,” said Phindile George, the leader of the Thembokwezi neighbourhood watch, which counts 50 volunteers including Msweswe and Madasi among its members. Across South Africa, tens of thousands of people are making similar resolutions. Some teach, secure reliable electricity supplies, organise vaccination drives, repair roads, deliver protective gear to hospitals or distribute water. Many work almost alone, others in NGOs or for wealthy businesses that are now setting aside large sums for philanthropic work.
What all share is an almost total lack of faith in South Africa’s government to provide any kind of a solution for their problems. “People have given up on the state as a protector … There is a massive loss of faith. It’s a tragedy,” said William Gumede, a respected analyst and academic in Johannesburg. The retreat of the state from everyday life in the continent’s most developed country has widespread consequences, changing the way people think, behave and interact, especially in a time of crisis. The death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who was almost universally revered, provided a moment of paradoxical hope as well as grief: reminding many South Africans of what they have in common after many months where circumstances have conspired to drive them apart. Most South Africans were suffering even before Covid struck, and discontent with the ruling African National Congress (ANC), in power since the end of the racist, repressive apartheid regime in 1994, has been growing for years. Economic growth was already slowing even before the nine-year rule of Jacob Zuma, the populist president ousted in 2018 amid widespread corruption allegations. Despite the good intentions of the current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, a former labour activist turned tycoon, there has been little to celebrate since. The pandemic has delivered a series of crushing blows to the economy. Rolling power cuts shut down businesses and factories for weeks on end, while the public healthcare system has been lethally undermined by mismanagement and corruption. The government claims 90,000 South Africans have died from Covid, but reliable excess mortality figures suggest the real death toll is between two and three times higher. Depending on the definition, unemployment could be as high as 46.6%.
In July, in the worst breakdown in public order for decades, hundreds of shopping malls were looted, warehouses torched and key infrastructure targeted across a swath of South Africa. Much of the violence appears to have been instigated by renegade factions within the ruling party, angered by the jailing of Zuma on contempt of court charges. This shook faith in the state too, and a few people turned to vigilante violence. The neighbourhood watch in Thembokwezi aims to reinforce official efforts, but in a rougher part of Khayelitsha a community has come together to confront local authorities. When a strict lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 led to widespread illegal evictions, hundreds of homeless people occupied a patch of wasteland and built homes of tin and wood. “For years the politicians said they would use this land for homes for us. They failed to fulfil their promises … So we decided to take it over and do it ourselves,” said Mabhelandile Twani, 40, a community leader.
Despite efforts to evict them anew, this neighbourhood has thrived. Now more than 15,000 people live in rows of shacks on the sandy soil. Electricity is diverted from better-supplied streets nearby. Twani calls it “people’s power”. The neighbourhood is known as Lockdown Village. There are many other such settlements born of the misery inflicted by Covid in a country unable to afford the expensive support offered to individuals and businesses in Europe, the UK or the US. In Khayelitsha, there are now settlements called Sanitiser, Quarantine and Social Distance. “Now things are so difficult. We don’t get help from the government. We try to help ourselves,” said Nondwebi Kasba, 73, who helps to run a communal vegetable garden set up by neighbours in Khayelithsa’s Illitha Park to help the poorest among them. Seven hundred miles to the east, in Graaff-Reinet, a small and conservative town in the Karoo desert, there is also a new struggle for the basics that the state once provided. In the townships on Graaff-Reinet’s outskirts, drug dealers steal water tanks from schools and hawk their contents alongside cannabis and methamphetamines. No one bothers to tell the police, expecting that they will not come. Jobs are rare. So too are the means by which young people could gain the skills to allow them to escape. Khanya Mbaile, a 31-year-old office administrator, hopes to start a coffee shop and internet cafe that would provide a safe meeting place for young people in the township where she lives. She has already sourced six computers from an NGO. “We are all exhausted but there is a glimmer of hope,” Mbaile said. Louise Masimela, 58, who runs a community school for young children in a township just south of Graaff-Reinet, is another of South Africa’s perpetual problem-solvers. The former journalist has no permanent premises for her students, scarce water and no funds to pay teachers. “It’s tough, really tough … but we want to give our kids an education that will allow them to go out into the world, not get stuck here,” said Masimela. So she has found solutions: a church offers a space during the week, and seven volunteers teach. Water comes from The Gift of the Givers, now one of South Africa’s biggest NGOs. Funded entirely by private donors, mainly businesses, it distributes 400m rand (£20m) of aid annually. In Eastern Cape province, the NGO works in hospitals, providing much-needed PPE, medicine, oxygen delivery devices, food for patients and even goody bags to motivate healthworkers. Elsewhere in the province, one of South Africa’s poorest, it has provided seeds, fodder and food for orphanages, trucked water into poor communities and even dug boreholes. “There are a lot of good people in government who want to do the right thing … and I can see things changing. It’s not massive change but people want to fix things,” said Dr Imtiaz Sooliman, the NGO’s founder. “We have to fill the gap but by filling the gap we are putting on pressure. People are asking why we are doing what the government should do.” Recent local elections have been seen by many analysts as a cause for optimism. The ANC was punished by voters, losing 8.3% of its vote share and just under 1,000 council seats. The party was forced to share power in many small towns – including Graaff-Reinet – and its grasp on cities such as Johannesburg and Pretoria slipped further. In several towns, local communities joined together to create political alternatives that frequently won support. “A lot of this is hopeful … It shows a desire for a new inclusive project,” said Gumede. Many see a need for political options that offer an authentic alternative to the ANC but also escape the toxic legacy of South Africa’s traumatic past. The dominance of the ANC at national level means the most important political battles occur within the organisation.
Judith February, an analyst, wrote for the Daily Maverick website in December: “From the insurrection in July to the shambles which is our intelligence services, [from] an increasing … anti-vaxx position to a commitment to coal, the tensions within the party are … at odds with the country’s best interests. Ramaphosa’s grip on power appears reluctant and tenuous.” Farmers say the relief provided by rain that has broken a five-year drought has helped the agricultural sector offset losses elsewhere, but the key industry of tourism has been badly hit by the pandemic, with huge losses of income and jobs. “It has been a disaster, a total disaster,” said 59-year-old Kobus Potgieter, who runs a farm guesthouse outside the town of Oudtshoorn, on the spectacular R62 road that was once busy with tourists. After 16 years he is thinking of closing for good, or at least downscaling.
In Franschhoek, a centre of fine dining and wine-making amid mountains and vineyards an hour’s drive from Cape Town, the absence of overseas visitors has forced top restaurants to close, hotels to shut for months, and led to the loss of thousands of jobs. As elsewhere, the national vaccination campaign has lacked resources, offering minimal opportunities for local people to get jabbed and almost no information that might help overcome very widespread hesitancy. To convince would-be visitors that the town was safe, Franschhoek’s tourist office sought to organise its own vaccination drive, supported by crowdfunding, big businesses and the local administration. By November, 85% of those working in the hospitality industry were jabbed. But just as the tourists began returning, the identification of the Omicron variant in South Africa brought new travel bans. “It was devastating,” said Ruth McCourt, a marketing manager.
In a country with some of the highest levels of inequality in the world, some have been able to weather South Africa’s economic and political storm better than others. Even its residents admit Franschhoek is a “bit of a bubble”. Khayelitsha is not, and its half a million inhabitants have little protection from the forces buffeting the country. “It will be a bitter, black Christmas,” said Twani, the community leader in Lockdown Village, interviewed in mid-December. “My fear is that here in South Africa we are living in a timebomb. People are angry … Eventually, anything can happen.” • This article was amended on 4, 6 and 7 January 2022 to correct misspellings of Franschhoek, Oudtshoorn, and the surname of Kobus Potgieter.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/a-crisis-of-faith-in-south-africa-people-have-given-up-on-the-state
5729;5729; ‘No worries’: how America came to banish Australia’s go-to phrase;2022-01-04T03:45:00Z;['Ann Ding'];['Australian lifestyle', 'Life and style', 'Australia news'];"A list of “banished words”, published annually by Michigan’s Lake Superior State University, has this year included the unmistakably Australian “no worries”. LSSU’s tongue-in-cheek list has been compiled every year since 1976 from submissions on terms deemed “familiar but problematic”. This year’s list also includes, among others, “asking for a friend”, “circle back” and “wait, what?” for elimination. While the list takes submissions from around the world, executive director of marketing and communications at LSSU, Peter Szatmary, said “not a single of the many nominators of ‘no worries’ came from Australia. All nominators of ‘no worries’ listed their addresses as in the US”. But how did this Australianism get there?
“The same way anything does: use, contact, and time,” says Tiger Webb, a language researcher and chair of the ABC’s English usage committee. The first use of “no worries” goes back to a 1965 edition of Sydney’s Oz magazine, according to the Oxford English dictionary. The expression probably received a boost in popularity from Australian cultural exports such as Crocodile Dundee, which Webb says contains six instances, as well as the Sydney Olympics and Steve Irwin. “‘No worries’ is a victim of its own success, and has since become naturalised in America, that is, stripped of specific Australian connotations.” Webb says one American lexicographer and writer on usage, Bryan Garner, dates the shift to naturalisation to about the year 2000. Examples of “no worries” in the wild, “with no accompanying Australiana”, begin to appear around then, such as this New York Times article from 2000, “No Goals, No Complaints, No Worries for US National Team”, or this 1999 Rolling Stone article, which begins: “No worries: Basement Jaxx makes the world’s happiest dance music.” Google’s Ngram viewer, which allows users to look at the frequency of a word or phrase’s occurrence in a corpus of books, also shows that beginning in the 90s, the term starts to become more frequent in American English, shooting up sharply after 2000.
Lauren Sadow, a postdoctoral fellow at Macquarie University’s school of education who has a background in linguistics, guesses that more recent influences in popular and social media have likely helped to spread “no worries” even further, with Australians such as Margot Robbie, Rebel Wilson and the Hemsworths rising to fame. On top of this, the phrase has been popularly memed in recent times.
It’s not the first time this little expression has been noticed, either: a 2014 Quartz article looks at how it might have “infected” US English. In the UK, decades of Neighbours have helped it to become commonplace – in a 2007 ninemsn article, linguist David Crystal said an uptick in “no worries” had been noticed in the preceding 10 to 15 years. Webb also mentions the phrase hakuna matata, from Disney’s 1994 movie The Lion King: “Hakuna matata is translated as meaning no worries, which suggests the phrase was not alien to US audiences.” As for why it’s been nominated for banishment this year, LSSU’s entry for the phrase says it “incorrectly substitutes for ‘You’re welcome’”. The list quotes one submission as saying: “If I’m not worried, I don’t want anyone telling me not to worry.” It adds: “If I am upset, I want to discuss being upset.” “The description given in the list misunderstands the phrase’s usage, at least in Australian English,” Sadow says. “In Australian English, although it is used in the same place as ‘you’re welcome’, the meaning is quite different.” “It is the speaker saying that they feel ‘no worries’, and that they think the listener should have ’no worries’.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Webb is a little less restrained. “In my view the compilers of the Banished Words list at LSSU are idiotically mistaken to view ‘no worries’ as misused, overused, or incorrect.” Those who object to being told not to worry are “misunderstanding on two fairly fundamental levels”, he says. “In this context, ‘no worries’ indicates that the person being thanked went through no trouble or difficulty; it is not an imperative from the person being thanked that the person doing the thanking should not worry. “Even if it were, that would still probably be fine: a lot of small talk is what’s known as phatic, that is, there for the purposes of social interaction rather than information transfer,” Webb says. Sadow says: “It wouldn’t be used in a situation (as one commenter said) where either party would actually have worries. It would be completely inappropriate to say ‘You broke my leg!’ ‘No worries’.” She points out that it is “very similar to the US English ‘no problem’”, another expression that might qualify as phatic. “I would say that its usage has been misunderstood by people who do not have it in their own idiolect,” Sadow says.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/no-worries-how-america-came-to-banish-australias-go-to-phrase
5730;5730;Morrison government warned about lack of rapid antigen tests in September, AMA claims;2022-01-04T03:35:18Z;['Sarah Martin', 'Michael McGowan'];['Health', 'Coronavirus', 'Australian politics', 'Scott Morrison', 'Australia news'];"The Australian Medical Association warned senior executives in the federal health department of the need to develop a national strategy for procuring rapid antigen tests (RATs) in September last year. But the AMA’s vice-president, Chris Moy, said that he was told in the meeting that the government did not want to intervene in the private market. “I asked the question of them because I knew what was happening in other countries, and we needed to transition, so what was the plan?” Moy told Guardian Australia. “We needed to get a lot of them [RATs], and we needed a really clear strategy to transition, it was so bloody obvious. “They have been caught short because of Omicron and the number of cases, but the bottom line is if you are going to rely on the private market in a health emergency you need to make pretty damn sure that they are ready.”
The chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, warned retailers on Tuesday the watchdog would not hesitate to “name and shame” companies engaging in “unconscionable conduct” over the pricing of the tests. “The ACCC is obviously acutely aware of the concern over the pricing of rapid antigen tests [and] we’re in the process of writing to both the suppliers and the retailers of these rapid antigen tests to find out what their stock levels are, their predictions of stock levels and most importantly what their costs are, what their pricing is and how that’s evolved over time,” he said. “I’d like to see, if any retailers are pricing as high as $45 for a test when they’re normally supposed to be a third of that, that they would immediately take notice of what we’re saying today and take those prices down.” Sims told reporters the ACCC had begun investigating reports of price gouging following a request from the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and had already seen reports of “excessive pricing” particularly on individual-sales sites such as Gumtree and Kogan. Sims said the watchdog had received more than 100 reports of potential “unconscionable” or misleading conduct over the products and he urged people to contact the ACCC if they encountered examples of the price of tests being unreasonably inflated. He said the ACCC would also be examining claims the current pricing levels of rapid antigen tests were due to challenges in obtaining supply of the tests. The government is under growing pressure to provide free rapid antigen tests across the community as case numbers in Australia reach record highs, while testing clinics remain overwhelmed. But Sims stopped short of criticising the federal government, saying that while “clearly demand is outstripping supply”, it was unclear what was causing the shortages. “The pricing of these is not something I’m going to comment on, obviously you can see both sides of that argument,” Sims said in response to questions about whether the tests should be provided free.
On Tuesday, New South Wales and Victoria registered record daily case numbers. NSW had 23,131 new cases, while Victoria recorded 14,020. Queensland registered a record 5,699 cases, while South Australia had 3,246 new cases, the ACT 926, Tasmania 702 and the Northern Territory 75. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said the government will not make the rapid tests free for everyone, but is in the process of finalising concessional access with state and territory leaders. National cabinet is expected to sign off on the details in a meeting on Wednesday. Regardless of the cost, supplies remain constrained in the private market across the country, with frustration growing that the tests cannot be found on chemist and supermarket shelves. The Queensland health minister, Yvette D’Ath, said Queensland would distribute 500,000 RATs to public testing clinics from Wednesday, but supplies remain constrained across the country. “This is happening across the country. We are as prepared as we can be, but have a look at what is happening around the world,” she said. “This is not unique to Australia. There is not one country, there is not one state who can say that we don’t have lines, that you won’t have to wait for tests now.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
She said RATs needed to be “heavily subsidised” or made free to ensure equity of access. “We do want to make sure they are affordable, we do want to make sure people have easy access to them and we don’t want to become a society where only those who can afford it get it.” She said she had also appealed to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to fast-track any outstanding approvals for test kits, including those made in Australia. The Queensland chief health officer, John Gerrard, said the Omicron virus had changed the pandemic landscape, with each infected person now infecting between seven and 10 people. “The Omicron strain really has changed everything – I know it sounds like a cliche, but that has completely changed all the planning,” Gerrard said.
The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said Morrison was ultimately responsible for the lack of supply. “It’s about time the prime minister took responsibility for something himself, for doing his job. And his job is to ensure supply, just like it was his job to secure supply of the vaccine,” Albanese said. But the opposition leader fell short of saying the tests should be made free. “We think that if someone needs a rapid antigen test, and they can’t afford it, they should get one. Everyone should have access to a rapid antigen test. It shouldn’t be dependent upon your income.” However his NSW counterpart, Chris Minns, went further, saying on Tuesday that the NSW Labor party believed the state was facing an “urgent situation” and that the tests “need to be free of charge”. “This is what is happening in other jurisdictions around the world. It’s happening in the UK, it’s happening in the USA, it works,” Minns said. “The minimum the government can do for the citizens of this state, is ensure that they’re providing the services so that they can test whether they’ve got Covid or not, that’s the smallest and minimum thing the government can do on behalf of the citizens of New South Wales. “Now, at the end of the day, it’s a difficult set of circumstances and we know that we have to live with Covid. But that doesn’t mean we can live without a government.” The Nationals senator Matt Canavan said the TGA was to blame for the hold-up, and said making the tests free would exacerbate demand. “The hold-up was at the feet of the TGA,” he told Sky News on Tuesday. “We should have been better prepared for this.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/morrison-government-warned-about-lack-of-rapid-antigen-tests-in-september-ama-claims
5731;5731;Queensland Covid update: people queuing for seven hours as private testing site closures cause chaos;2022-01-04T02:13:58Z;['Ben Smee'];['Queensland', 'Health', 'Coronavirus', 'Australia news'];"More than a dozen Queensland Covid-19 testing clinics were unexpectedly closed on Tuesday, creating chaos and waiting times of up to seven hours at other sites. In the 24 hours to 7pm on Monday, Queensland recorded 5,699 new Covid cases, another daily record and up by more than 1,000 on the previous day. The state’s chief health officer said he expected total cases “in the hundreds of thousands, if not more” by the end of the month, as the highly infectious Omicron variant circulates.
Testing sites were thrown into chaos as people arrived to find private clinics shuttered, despite the Queensland Health website showing they were open. The health minister, Yvette D’ath, said 17 private pathology sites were initially shown as reopening on Tuesday, but had not done so. In some cases, that was due to staffing issues at those facilities. Several people who contacted Guardian Australia said there had been confusion at those sites around the scheduled opening time. People then flocked to public testing sites, where wait times of up to seven hours were estimated.
People were turned away from an open drive-through testing site at Murrarie due to traffic congestion. “There [are] very long lines at our testing clinics across the state,” D’ath said. “This is happening across the country. We are as prepared as we can be. “We can’t direct a public pathologist to open up, we can’t force their staff to go to work if they’re positive, we just can’t ask that. “We are seeing lines all over the country of people trying to get tests, [and] we know there is not sufficient supply of rapid antigen tests at the moment.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
On Tuesday, authorities confirmed the outbreak had spread to Aboriginal communities at Northern Peninsula, Woorabinda and Mornington Island in addition to growing outbreaks at Cherbourg and Palm Island. The state’s chief health officer, John Gerrard, said that of the more than 25,000 active cases in Queensland only 11 people were in intensive care, with two on ventilators. “We know there are going to be more than that,” Gerrard said.
“The percentage of tests that are coming back positive has increased substantially in the past few days, [and] this suggests there are more people in the community with Covid-19 yet to be picked up. “This is a clearly very contagious virus, but the news so far, the good news, is we still as of last night only had 11 patients in intensive care. “The disease we’re seeing at the moment bears no resemblance to the disease we saw last year, both here and overseas – largely because of vaccination but also because [of the Omicron variant]. “The number of cases we’re expecting to see through January will be very high. Certainly in the hundreds of thousands, if not more in Queensland.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/queensland-covid-update-people-queuing-for-seven-hours-as-private-testing-site-closures-cause-chaos
5732;5732;Scott Boland keeps spot in Australian team for Sydney Ashes Test;2022-01-04T01:51:48Z;['Guardian sport'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'The Ashes', 'Australia cricket team', 'Australia sport', 'Cricket', 'England cricket team', 'Sport'];"Boxing Day Test hero Scott Boland has retained his place in Australia’s XI for the fourth Ashes Test in Sydney, after fellow paceman Josh Hazlewood was not deemed ready to return from injury. Captain Pat Cummins on Tuesday said there would be just the one enforced change to the side to play England at the SCG from Wednesday, with Usman Khawaja replacing Travis Head, who is unavailable after testing positive for Covid-19.
Boland made a spectacular debut last week, taking 6-7 as Australia wrapped up the third Test on his home ground and won the player-of-the-match award. The Victorian retained his spot after Hazlewood, who has missed the past two Tests with a side strain, fell short of proving himself fully fit, as did fellow paceman Jhye Richardson, who has a leg problem. “Scotty gets a go, Joshy Hazlewood had a few bowls and with Jhye [Richardson] a bit similar,” Cummins said. “Just not quite up to 100%, we gave Joshy every chance we could. We just felt like he couldn’t quite bowl at full tilt yesterday. We’re still hoping that he will be right for [the fifth Test in] Hobart, just give him another week. “I think this wicket you’re not going to blast them out. There’s a little bit of grass on it but traditionally it’s hard work. It goes five days and you need that really physical and stump to stump bowler and that’s what Scotty brings to the table.” The Australians again opted for a four-man pace attack and one spinner. There had been talk uncapped spinner Mitchell Swepson might get the nod. However, Cummins suggested the Queensland leggie was likely to get a debut in one of Australia’s Tests on the subcontinent next year. He said the SCG had been hard work for bowlers in recent years and with rain forecast during the Test the pitch might not break up that much.

5733;5733;What do I do if I test positive for Covid? Here’s how to prepare for the result;2022-01-04T00:46:17Z;['Rafqa Touma'];['Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'New South Wales', 'Victoria', 'Infectious diseases'];"For Krisinda Merhi, recovering from Covid while isolating in her bedroom felt like “exhausting nothingness”. “You’re tired from doing nothing, because you both can’t and don’t have the energy to,” she says. The 25-year-old Sydneysider contracted Covid after a trip to Melbourne in November. It started with “slight congestion and a persistent cough”.
After receiving a positive PCR result, Merhi instantly relocated to her bedroom, where she stayed isolated for a week. Luckily, her family of five, who isolated inside the home as close contacts, all remained negative. As daily Covid numbers surpass 21,000 in New South Wales, and “worst case” Covid modelling suggests 200,000 cases a day nationwide by late January, Prof Jayashra Kulkarni says isolation inside the home as either a Covid-positive person or close contact is becoming “a common experience now”. Kulkarni is a professor of psychiatry from Monash University, and has isolated in her home as a close contact of a Covid-positive family member. She says “it is helpful to know you are not alone”. “Once a family member is detected to be positive, the immediate response is to be anxious,” she says. But Kulkarni reminds us that “human beings are designed to cope with crises”.
Here’s what to do if you test positive and need to isolate. The environment Once you receive a positive diagnosis, positive cases should “immediately isolate yourself at your home, or other accommodation”, according to Queensland Health. “Isolate means you need to stay away from other people as much as possible so you don’t give the virus to someone else. “People living in your house can quarantine at home in a separate area to you. It is still important that you isolate as much as possible from these people so that you don’t give them Covid-19 if they haven’t already caught it,” the advice states. If you cannot safely isolate in your home, public health departments in all states and territories offer special health accommodation in some circumstances. Health authorities advise Covid-positive cases to use a separate bathroom if available, or clean a shared bathroom after each use. Wearing a mask inside your home is also important, especially when entering a room you are sharing with others, according to NSW Health. Ventilating common spaces, such as by opening windows, can also reduce the risk of transmission.
The rules On 30 December, national cabinet agreed to new isolation rules for positive Covid-19 cases. Under the new arrangement, a confirmed case must isolate for seven days from the date they took the test swab that confirmed their infection. They should not leave isolation if they are still symptomatic. The supplies Public health advice stresses the need to organise for your food and medication supplies to be delivered to you without contact, whether that be from a friend, family member or delivery service. The government recommends widely available painkillers for treating mild symptoms, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Kulkarni’s shopping list for a week of Covid isolation inside the home includes disposable gloves and surgical masks. She recalls “feeling really exhausted, and not knowing why you’re exhausted”. “So take hot showers, drink lots of tea, and get lots of rest.”
Dr Jenny H Martin, a practising physician and clinical pharmacologist of the University of Newcastle, says “staying well hydrated” is helpful to manage symptoms and discomfort. “People find it difficult to drink water, so Hydralyte is helpful.” Kulkarni says organising the “bits and pieces” of receiving grocery deliveries, or care-packages dropped off by friends, is another consideration. Watching physical health Care guidelines are changing as states and territories respond to the Omicron outbreak, but public health advice is fairly consistent. According to Queensland Health, the general rule is that people who are well or have mild symptoms should stay at home for their illness. “Only call Triple Zero (000) or go to an emergency department if you have severe symptoms,” the authority recommends. In a person with underlying, compromising health conditions, symptoms may be more severe. According to the federal government’s healthdirect website, these are the more severe symptoms you should watch for, that indicate you need to go to the hospital: your oxygen level is 92% or less when you test using the pulse oximeter, even if you feel okay worsening shortness of breath or difficulty breathing blue lips or face pain or pressure in the chest cold and clammy, or pale and mottled, skin fainting or collapse being more confused becoming difficult to wake up little or no urine (wee) output – less urine than usual, even though you have been drinking lots of fluid coughing up blood Kulkarni also suggests close contacts who may share the home with a Covid-positive person “keep an eye on transmission” with rapid antigen tests “for peace of mind”.
Remembering mental health “A person in isolation can feel totally cut off,” Kulkarni says. “The cleanliness factor gets hyped up, and it needs to be. But looking after mental health is important.” She says keeping up communication while in isolation is “really critical”. To feel connected to people while in isolation, Merhi video called with friends and watched movies over the phone with her partner. She says she was “lucky” to have a balcony. “It made it a lot easier to self-isolate. I could actually get fresh air. It was easier on my sanity.” Martin suggests making a list of friends and family to get in touch with, and “working through that list of people each day”. “Some people do yoga, others make at-home gyms with milk bottles filled with water,” she says. “The isolation seems like the hardest thing – just sitting in your room, counting down the hours. “So it doesn’t really matter, you just have to be engaging in something.” The aftermath After the infectious period has ended, “do not disturb the room or bathroom for a day”, Martin says. “Let it settle. Then wear a mask and gloves, and clean all surfaces with disinfectant.”
Kulkarni says that, amid a time of “consideration and changes”, it is important to keep abreast of health rules in your state. “We are in some ways in a middle ground,” she says. “Omicron appears to be a milder illness, particularly in those vaccinated. That is encouraging.” At the same time, however, people remain concerned. “Particularly when you see stories from overseas of long Covid, and events need to be cancelled.” Critical to balancing this, she says, is getting “focused and practical” about a Covid positive result, and being prepared for isolation.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/the-covid-isolation-guide-how-to-prepare-for-a-positive-result
5734;5734;Theranos verdict: five key moments from the trial that shook Silicon Valley;2022-01-04T00:40:32Z;['Kari Paul'];['Theranos', 'Technology', 'Silicon Valley', 'Law (US)', 'US news'];"Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of blood testing company Theranos, was found guilty of four charges of fraud on Monday, ending a closely followed saga that could have major implications for the tech world. Over the course of several months, federal prosecutors laid out a case to the jury that Holmes knowingly scammed investors and patients, artificially inflating the value of Theranos and lying about the capabilities of its technology. The trial has been nearly as spectacular as the rapid rise and fall of the company, which at its height was hailed as a game changer and attracted hundreds of millions in investment. Here are five key moments to remember in the case that shook Silicon Valley.
High-profile investors takes the stand Holmes managed to woo billionaire investors and assemble a board of directors comprising former US cabinet members spanning from the Nixon to Trump administrations. While most of these early Theranos players did not appear in court, one did make an appearance: James Mattis was called to testify by the prosecution in the early days of the proceedings. He stated he personally invested $85,000 in the company, finding the technology “pretty breathtaking” but lost faith after the Wall Street Journal reporting.
“There came a point where I didn’t know what to believe about Theranos any more,” he said. Former employees speak out The prosecution paraded a number of former Theranos employees as witnesses during the trial, including three different lab directors. Former Theranos lab director Kingshuk Das testified that Holmes seemed reluctant to acknowledge any criticisms of the Theranos technology, giving “implausible” excuses for apparent failures in the company’s tests. “I found these instruments to be unsuitable for clinical use,” he said of the company’s proprietary Edison devices. Other lab directors Lynette Sawyer and Sunil Dhawan said the job required “minimal” in-person work and that they spent the majority of their time doing paperwork, not testing the actual hardware used in blood analysis. More key testimony came from Erika Cheung, a former Theranos employee, who took the stand for three days to detail shortcomings of the company’s blood testing processes. She said she was very concerned about the accuracy of the technology and occasionally refused to run patient samples on the devices. Patients “don’t know the fact that behind closed doors we’re having all these problems and they think they’re getting correct results”, Cheung said. “It was starting to get very, very uncomfortable and very stressful for me working at the company.” Holmes defends herself, alleges abuse Perhaps the most shocking moment in the trial came when Holmes herself was called to the stand by her defense team to testify. The risky move allowed her to make her own case to the jury, potentially garnering more sympathy ahead of deliberations. But it also opened her to cross-examination from the prosecution, during which attorneys grilled her for several days about inconsistencies in her story.
Holmes claimed on the stand that she trusted statements from her scientists that Theranos technology was working as planned and that she did not purposely mislead anyone. She also laid out bombshell allegations that her former business partner and lover, Sunny Balwani, abused her, influencing her to commit fraud. The two met when Balwani was 38 years old and Holmes was only 18. She said Balwani wanted her to “kill the old Elizabeth”, controlling what she ate and who she spent time with so that she could become a successful CEO. “He had taught me everything I thought I knew about business and he was the best business person that I knew,” Holmes said. “I didn’t question him in the way that I otherwise would have.” The ‘smoking gun’: pharmaceutical logos One integral piece of evidence prosecutors frequently returned to was that Holmes doctored documents sent to potential investors. The Walgreens CFO, Wade Miquelon, said during his testimony that Holmes had implied the pharmaceutical firms Pfizer and Schering-Plough had validated the company’s blood-testing technology. He said Holmes shared with investors and potential partners a document carrying the Pfizer logo, purportedly showing the drug company’s support. But the document had been forged, the prosecution claims. “Pfizer did not write this,” prosecutor Robert Leach said in opening arguments for the trial. “Pfizer did not put its logo on this. Pfizer did not give its permission to put its logo on this. Pfizer did not make the conclusions in this report.” In her testimony, Holmes admitted to personally manipulating those documents, saying she did so not to imply that the companies had vetted the technology but “because this work was done in partnership with those companies and I was trying to convey that”. “I wish I had done it differently,” Holmes told jurors.
Evidence offers window into Holmes’s life Submitted into evidence, amid the thousands of pages of dense laboratory tests and scientific data, were a handful of documents that offered a window into Holmes’s mindset as she stood at the helm of one of Silicon Valley’s buzziest companies. “I do everything I say – word for word. I am never a minute late. I show no excitement,” one strict handwritten note to herself said. She obsessively tracked her food, drinking a daily green juice and avoiding sugar. “ALL ABOUT BUSINESS.” “I am not impulsive.” “I do not react.” “I am always proactive.” “I know the outcome of every encounter.” “I do not hesitate.” “I speak rarely. When I do – CRISP and CONCISE. I call bullshit immediately. My hands are always in my pockets or gesturing,” the note read. Also in evidence were hundreds of pages of text messages between Holmes and Balwani, many amorous and others business-like. In some they referenced a bird they owned together. Also in evidence: an aerial photo of a home they owned together in Atherton. “You are the breeze in desert [sic] for me – my water, and ocean,” she texted Balwani in May 2015, according to a recent court filing. “OK,” he replied. The two frequently used the phrase “hmfr” which Holmes said references an Arabic phrase that translates roughly to “this too is my God’s glory”. In her journals and texts with Balwani, Holmes referenced a spiritual connection and a belief that God put Balwani in her life for a higher purpose. “Love you,” one message from Balwani reads. “I prayed from the bottom of my heart for you. I have never prayed with this intensity in my life for anything.” “I love this,” Holmes replied. “My nirvana.”";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/03/theranos-verdict-five-key-moments-from-the-trial-that-shook-silicon-valley
5735;5735;Theranos jury says it remains deadlocked on three of 11 fraud counts;2022-01-04T00:04:40Z;['Kari Paul'];['Theranos', 'Silicon Valley', 'US news', 'Technology', 'Law (US)'];"The jury weighing fraud charges against Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has told the court it is unable to reach a unanimous verdict on three of the 11 criminal counts she faces. Jurors in the high-profile Silicon Valley trial had been deliberating for seven days after a trial that chronicled the missteps of the now-defunct blood testing startup. Over the course of 15 weeks, federal prosecutors called 29 witnesses, outlining missteps and alleged fraud Holmes committed during her 15-year reign as CEO. In a dramatic turn of events, US jurors returned a note to the judge on Monday morning saying they were deadlocked on three charges. In response to the note, US district judge Edward Davila gave the jury what is called an Allen charge, encouraging them to deliberate further. But jurors returned to the court several hours later, saying they remained unable to move forward. Davila then sent jurors back to the jury room to fill out a verdict form. It’s not yet clear whether the jury will render its remaining verdicts on Monday.
Holmes faces nine charges of fraud and two charges of conspiracy to commit fraud. It is not clear on which of those charges the jury was unable to come to an agreement. If the jury is unable to come to a conclusion, it may under federal rules deliver a partial verdict. Such a conclusion would, however, leave Holmes open to be re-charged with the remaining three charges at a later time. Holmes founded Theranos after dropping out of Stanford at the age of 19, promising a revolutionary technology that could run hundreds of health tests on just a drop of blood. A charismatic character known for her blonde hair, uniform of black turtlenecks and low voice, Holmes quickly rose to fame in and outside the tech world, gracing the covers of major magazines, headlining conferences, and drawing comparisons to Apple’s Steve Jobs. As Theranos grew, the company attracted big-name investors including the former secretaries of state George Schultz and Henry Kissinger. At its height, Theranos was valued at more than $9bn. But Theranos ultimately fell short of its ambitious pledge. Wall Street Journal reporting in 2015 revealed that the company’s in-house tests had massive inaccuracies, and that the company was performing other tests using traditional blood drawing methodology and outside labs. During the trial, prosecutors painted a picture of Holmes as a strict, power-hungry leader willing to go to any lengths to save her company’s image, repressing internal and external dissent and manipulating the press. Taking the stand in her own defense, Holmes argues she made decisions in good faith and did not knowingly commit fraud.";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/03/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-verdict-latest
5736;5736;UK house sales to first-time buyers reach highest for 19 years;2022-01-04T00:01:01Z;['Rupert Jones'];['First-time buyers', 'Housing', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Society', 'Property', 'Money', 'Mortgages'];"The number of UK first-time homebuyers has hit its highest level since 2002, according to a new estimate. Despite the uncertainty generated by the pandemic and strong house price growth, the number of first-time buyer transactions in 2021 is estimated to be 408,300, according to Yorkshire Building Society. That would be a 35% increase on the 303,000 transactions in 2020, and more than double the levels in the years following the global financial crisis of 2007-08. The previous first-time buyer peak was in 2002, when 531,800 households took their first step on to the housing ladder, and one would need to go back 15 years to see numbers similar to those being predicted for 2021, said the Yorkshire. In 2006, the number of first-time buyers was 400,900. “Clearly, new buyers have not been deterred by the price of a typical first-time buyer home, which has increased by 9% to £222,997 in the year to October,” the building society said. Average house prices have surged to record highs over the past year, presenting an obstacle to many trying to buy their first home. Meanwhile, the continuing pandemic – including a third national lockdown running from January until March last year – is likely to have caused some to put their home-buying plans on hold. However, a range of factors including low borrowing costs and government guarantees for mortgages arguably helped others to take their first step on to the property ladder. The stamp duty holiday – which ended on 30 September 2021 in England and Northern Ireland – has been credited with fuelling a boom in the market. First-time buyers already benefited from stamp duty relief on the first £300,000 of the purchase price, but the additional relief on the value between £300,000 and £500,000 will have led to savings – and reduced borrowing – in many cases, particularly benefiting new buyers in pricier areas such as London and the south-east, said the society. Meanwhile, many people’s spending plummeted during the lockdowns, which meant some would-be first-time buyers were able to save up a larger sum for a deposit more quickly than perhaps they had anticipated. The new figures are for first-time buyers purchasing with a mortgage.
However, Yorkshire said it was unlikely that first-time buyer numbers would continue at this level during 2022 and beyond. First-time buyers accounted for half of house purchases with a mortgage in 2021, which is the same proportion as last year, though in the years between 2006 and 2011 the figure was below 40%. The analysis was based on lending figures up to October 2021 from the banking body UK Finance, with Yorkshire Building Society making estimates for November and December last year.";https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/04/uk-house-sales-first-time-buyers-highest-nearly-20-years
5737;5737;UK government extends powers to intervene in foreign takeovers;2022-01-04T00:01:00Z;['Rob Davies'];['Mergers and acquisitions', 'Business', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"Ministers have greater powers to block foreign takeovers of British firms after new rules came into effect on Tuesday giving them more scope to unpick deals that have the potential to harm national security. The National Security and Investment Act, which enhances existing powers, is described by the government as the “biggest shake-up of the UK’s national security regime for 20 years”. Ministers have already been able to intervene in deals where a foreign-led takeover could affect economic stability, media plurality, the UK’s pandemic response, or national security. However, the act builds on the government’s ability to deploy the national security rationale for “calling in” a takeover. It identifies 17 areas of the economy that warrant greater scrutiny when overseas investors seek to make an acquisition. In addition to defence and military technology, ministers will be able to examine deals in a wide range of sectors such as advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, the civil nuclear sector, transport and quantum technology. Officials will be notified that a deal is worthy of examination when a buyer takes its stake above three trigger points: 25%, 50% and 75%. The government can block these transactions and even unwind them restrospectively if they were completed on or after 12 November 2020, the day the bill was introduced to parliament. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said: “The UK is world-renowned as an attractive place to invest but we have always been clear that we will not hesitate to step in where necessary to protect our national security. “The new investment screening process in place from today is simple and quick, giving investors and firms the certainty they need to do business, and giving everyone in the UK the peace of mind that their security remains our number one priority.” The act is viewed by some as a response to concern about Chinese takeovers of strategically important technology businesses, with some of the deals already being pored over by officials under existing rules. They include relatively small deals, such as the sale of the semiconductor manufacturer Newport Wafer Fab to a Dutch company owned by China’s Wingtech, which is partially backed by the state. Newport Wafer Fab has multiple contracts with the UK government, including defence-related projects. The government funding body UK Research and Innovation has suspended grants to the company, while a consortium of British investors is reportedly ready to submit a £300m bid if the deal is blocked. Much larger foreign buyouts by US companies also came under the microscope in 2021, owing to concerns about national security or intellectual property. Takeovers of the defence suppliers Ultra Electronics and Meggitt attracted government scrutiny, as did the $75bn (£56bn) takeover of the world-leading chipmaker Arm by its rival Nvidia – a deal that is the subject of competition investigations in the UK, US and Europe.
Plans to expand the government’s remit to examine such deals have divided opinion. It will apply regardless of the size of a company by revenue, or where the prospective acquirer is based, even if it is in the UK. Business groups have warned that the breadth of criteria could result in unnecessary meddling in a large volume of deals, deterring investment in the UK and bogging down officials in needless paperwork. The government has said that while up to 1,800 deals a year would be notifiable under the new powers, fewer than 100 would be called in for a full review. Reviews are intended to last a maximum of 30 days, faster than is typical at the moment, thanks to a new investment screening unit.
Kwarteng has also faced criticism, including from the Henry Jackson Society thinktank, for reducing the equity threshold at which deals can be examined from 25% to 15%. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has insisted that the act will not lead to ministers “arbitrarily” intervening in takeovers. “The vast majority of acquisitions will require no intervention and will be able to proceed quickly and with certainty in the knowledge that the government will not revisit a transaction once cleared unless false or misleading information was provided,” the department said on Tuesday.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/uk-government-extends-powers-to-intervene-in-foreign-takeovers
5738;5738;Adele and Sheeran top sales charts but UK is buoyed in 2021 by Abba and Queen;2022-01-04T00:01:00Z;['Rupert Jones'];['Music industry', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Abba', 'Queen', 'Adele', 'Ed Sheeran'];"Adele and Ed Sheeran may have topped the UK sales charts in 2021, but it was decades-old songs by “heritage acts” such as Queen and Fleetwood Mac that helped millions of Britons through the pandemic, music industry figures suggest. British artists accounted for eight of the top 10 albums listened to in the UK last year, and many will not be surprised to learn that the No 1 and No 2 spots were taken by Adele and Ed Sheeran respectively with their blockbuster releases 30 and =. Both achieved more than 500m streams in 2021 in the UK alone, plus billions more globally, according to data released by the record labels’ association the BPI on Tuesday. Adele’s album, her fourth, was released in November, and notched up first-week chart sales of 262,000. Sheeran also had the bestselling single of 2021 with Bad Habits. However, the list revealed that during troubled times many people reach for the familiarity and comfort provided by classic acts, many of which are being discovered by new generations of music fans thanks to streaming. At No 5 in the table of 2021’s bestselling and most streamed albums was a record originally released 40 years ago: Greatest Hits by Queen, featuring tracks including Bohemian Rhapsody and We Will Rock You. No 8 was Diamonds, a greatest hits album from Elton John. Originally issued in 2017 , it feature classic songs from 1970 to 2016. No 9 was 50 Years – Don’t Stop, a career-spanning collection from Fleetwood Mac that was released in 2018. In third place was another heritage act, albeit one releasing an album of new music. Abba staged pop’s biggest comeback with their new collection Voyage, which will be accompanied by a “digital avatar” concert residency in a London arena from May. Newcomers did manage a look-in, though, with the US singer Olivia Rodrigo and the UK rapper Dave featuring in the albums top 10. The BPI said streaming in particular was enabling a vast array of new British artists, from guitar bands such as the Lathums to soul singers including Joy Crookes, to break through. One-hundred and eighty artists achieved more than 100m streams in the UK over the past 12 months, while more than 1,900 acts had their songs streamed at least 10m times in Britain. While streaming continues to dominate the way we listen to music, the vinyl renaissance continued apace in 2021, with sales at their highest level in three decades. Another blast from the past – audio cassettes – enjoyed a resurgence, sales increased by a fifth to hit an 18-year high, providing fresh evidence of the collectible appeal of recorded music on physical formats. Overall, recorded music consumption in the UK rose by 2.5% in 2021, with 159m albums or their equivalent either streamed or bought across all formats.
Streaming accounted for 83% of overall music consumption in the UK last year, when people listened to more than 147bn audio streams, up 5.7% on the 139bn in 2020, according to the BPI. However, the appetite among some music fans for vinyl shows no sign of waning. The format defied supply chain and production challenges in 2021 to rack up a total of 5.3m copies sold. That is 11% up on the previous and amounts to a fourteenth year of consecutive growth. One of the biggest hits was Abba’s Voyage, which was described as the “fastest-selling vinyl of the century”. Compact discs have been in decline since 2004, though in 2021 the rate of decrease slowed to 11%, said the BPI. Geoff Taylor, the BPI’s chief executive, said: “As our lives continue to be disrupted, the past 12 months have reminded us again of the important role that recorded music plays in our lives. At the same time, the rise of streaming has empowered more artists than ever – from all backgrounds and eras – to build new fanbases around the world and to forge successful careers in music.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/adele-sheeran-abba-queen-2021-sales-streaming-top-10-albums
5739;5739;Calls for safe routes to UK as arrivals by small boat treble in a year;2022-01-04T00:01:00Z;['Rajeev Syal'];['Immigration and asylum', 'Home Office', 'Refugees', 'Migration', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"Refugee charities are urging the government to open safe routes or risk a new wave of fatalities in the Channel after the number of people who travelled to the UK by small boats trebled last year. Data released on Tuesday shows that more than 28,300 people crossed the Channel in 2021, three times the number for 2020. The record number came despite tens of millions of pounds being spent by the home secretary, Priti Patel, on new measures to discourage the journeys. Organisations that help new arrivals said the figures showed that the government’s strategy risked more deaths at sea. In one incident in November, 27 people including a seven-year-old boy and a pregnant woman drowned in the worst tragedy of its kind. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said he could envisage more deaths without a rethink. “This government must change its approach and instead of seeking to punish or push away people seeking safety because of the type of journey they have made to the UK, they must create and commit to safe routes,” he said. Clare Moseley, the founder of Care4Calais, which supports refugees living in northern France, said: “The government tells us that people should travel by legal means but if this were truly possible, why would so many be risking their lives in flimsy boats?” Minnie Rahman, the interim head of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said the government’s closure of safe routes had encouraged more dangerous journeys. “What’s changed is that safe routes to get here – like family reunion routes and the Syrian resettlement scheme – have completely shut down, forcing more people into the hands of people traffickers to get here,” she said.
At least 28,395 people reached the UK on small boats in 2021, according to analysis by the Press Association. The number of arrivals peaked in November when at least 6,869 people reached the UK. Between 10 and 16 November more than 3,100 made the perilous crossing, the most in any seven-day stretch in the current crisis. The same month also saw a new record for a single day in the crisis, with 1,185 people reaching British shores onboard 33 boats on 11 November. Despite international efforts to crack down on people smugglers, organised criminal gangs charge thousands of pounds for a berth in flimsy inflatable boats. Dinghies seen leaving French shores and being towed into Dover have increased in size over the past year, with some carrying as many as 50 people. The data shows an average of about 28 people on each small boat that arrived in the UK in 2021, up from just over 13 in 2020. Analysis by Ferrari news agency said last week that 28,381 people had travelled by small boat in 2021. The Home Office collects its own small boat data but refuses to release annual figures, which instead are compiled daily by journalists. The Home Office minister Tom Pursglove said the government was reforming its approach to asylum through its new plan for immigration. “Seeking asylum for protection should not involve people asylum shopping country to country, or risking their lives by lining the pockets of criminal gangs to cross the Channel,” he said. “The nationality and borders bill will make it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK illegally and introduce life sentences for those who facilitate illegal entry into the country. It will also strengthen the powers of Border Force to stop and redirect vessels, while introducing new powers to remove asylum seekers to have their claims processed outside the UK.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/calls-for-safe-routes-to-uk-as-arrivals-by-small-boat-treble-in-a-year
5740;5740;Peter Wright edges out Smith to win second PDC world championship;2022-01-03T23:38:32Z;['Jonathan Liew'];['PDC World Championships', 'Darts', 'Sport'];"Eyes moist, red mohican sparkling in the lights, scalp painting glistening with sweat, Peter Wright won his second PDC world championship in one of its tensest and most absorbing finals. He did so not by outscoring Michael Smith but by outlasting him, not by blowing him off the board but simply by resisting, holding his nerve and holding his throw against one of the heaviest and most relentless treble-hitters in the sport. As an exhausted Wright celebrated a 7-5 victory, Smith stood at the back of the stage: distraught, disconsolate, destroyed. He looked up at the lights, down at his feet, off to the side. He buried his face in his shirt. He turned and stared at the blue sponsor’s backdrop. Anything to avoid glancing at the Sid Waddell Trophy that was being placed on a plinth in front of him, the trophy that has now twice eluded him at the final hurdle.
He believed it was his time. We all felt it, too. He had beaten the defending champion Gerwyn Price, the dangerous James Wade, the breakthrough star of the year in Jonny Clayton. When he is on song and in rhythm, when the 180s flow from his fingers like piano music, there is barely a player on the planet who can live with him. And perhaps, ultimately, only a player like Wright could have thwarted him. Late in the game Smith was 5-4 up with a break of throw, an advantage that felt decisive. Instead Wright endured, much as he has been enduring his whole career. Darts never came easy to him. Life never came easy to him. Even in his moment of triumph, the boos from an uncharitable Alexandra Palace crowd continued to sting his ears. But here he was, the last man standing and now legitimately one of the greats of the sport. Long before a dart had been thrown in this final, Alexandra Palace was already a heaving hive of fervour and festivity, as grown men bellowed their viral load across the Palm Court arena and the old songs were revived with relish. You were reminded again just what a befuddling challenge it must be to throw pinpoint darts in this environment, amid the pounding music and the hollering of the referee and the ambient smell of lager and takeaway. Many wither on the big stage. For those who succeed, it must be akin to performing open heart surgery on a nightclub dancefloor. But both men had been here before. Wright had broken his duck by winning the title two years earlier, and at 51 years of age was somewhere near the peak of his powers. An introvert dressed as an extrovert, Wright is a creature of paradoxes and contradictions: the showman with a chronic shyness, the court jester who throws with a sniper’s precision, the relentlessly consistent scorer who changes his darts between tournaments, between matches, sometimes even – as here – in the fifth set of a world championship final.
Three years earlier, Smith had been demolished on this stage by Michael van Gerwen, breaking a hand midway through after punching a door in frustration. And for a while it felt like the experience might be a terminal one. His scoring had always been peerless. But in times of stress the arm would tense and the doubles would drift. As if he couldn’t quite take the final step. As if he was finally being forced to contemplate what it meant to win. Such was the fate that befell him here. He has now reached seven major televised finals, and lost the lot. The action was as loose and easy as ever, but the body language looked a little strained, the gaze a little pained. The canny Wright was taking his time between visits, forcing Smith to think as much as possible. The contrast between them was stark. Smith flings his darts as if they’re laughing emojis: one, two, three, who cares? Wright, by contrast, throws them as if he’s trying to construct the three parts of a perfect sentence. The first two sets were scrappy, and Wright won them both. But as Smith settled, his sheer weight of scoring began to impose itself. He swung himself back into the match with a sumptuous 167 checkout. Two-all became 3-3 became 4-4 became 5-5. One hour became two. Even the crowd seemed to tighten a little, as if aware that the time for frivolity had passed. On the stage, both players were betraying barely a flicker of tension or nerves, even as they knew – as we all did – that they were fooling absolutely nobody.
And finally it was Smith who cracked, missing a crucial bullseye to hold throw in the 12th set. Wright checked out 81 for a 12-dart finish, and before long the last rites were being administered. Smith had recorded a higher average (99 to 98). He had hit 24 180s to Wright’s 17. But as the old truism goes, darts is not simply a game of scoring but of timing. And as Smith blinked into the Palace lights, pyrotechnics lighting his face, he could be forgiven for wondering when his time might come again.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/peter-wright-edges-out-michael-smith-to-secure-second-world-darts-title
5741;5741;Covid cases rise by 948% in Florida as Omicron drives huge wave across US;2022-01-03T23:06:47Z;['Alexandra Villarreal'];['US news', 'Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus', 'Florida', 'World news'];"Covid-19 cases in Florida have risen by 948% in just two weeks, as the highly transmissible Omicron variant drives a huge wave of infections and hospitalizations across the US.
Even as Dr Anthony Fauci – Joe Biden’s top medical adviser – cautioned the public to look at hospitalizations and not infections in order to gauge Omicron’s severity, the seven-day average for US patients hospitalized with Covid-19 increased by more than 40% during the week between Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Cases have risen by more than 100% nationally, despite tests being in short supply in many areas, and infections have doubled in the last seven days to an average of 418,000 a day, according to a Reuters tally. In Florida, local and state officials warned that residents were waiting hours in sometimes miles-long lines just to get a test. Some accused the state health department and the governor, Ron DeSantis, of being missing in action. “It’s every man/woman for themselves, because leadership is MIA,” tweeted state senator Shevrin Jones. Evidence suggests Omicron is a more mild if highly infectious variant. But it “will still do terrible damage among the unvaccinated in both the US and worldwide”, according to the New York Times.
Only 62% of the US population is fully vaccinated, with numbers especially low in the south and many of the mountain states. Boosters are available for people 16 and older, but only about a third of fully vaccinated Americans have opted to get one – despite Fauci saying the extra dose represents “optimal” protection from Omicron. The Food and Drug Administration decided on Monday that 12- to 15-year-olds should also be eligible for a booster, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still needs to give the green light. Some immunocompromised Americans are going back for fourth or fifth shots, though it is unclear whether doing so is safe or effective, the New York Times reported. Dorry Segev, a transplant surgeon at Johns Hopkins University, told the paper that hundreds enrolled in a study he is working on have received unauthorized doses. “They’re acting out of desperation,” he said. “Rather than say, ‘Shame on them,’ I would say, ‘Shame on the system we’ve created.’” In Washington DC, meanwhile, Congress is experiencing an unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases, with the seven-day positivity rate at a congressional test site surging to 13% from just 1% in late November, the Capitol’s attending physician said on Monday. Most coronavirus infections on Capitol Hill have been occurring among the vaccinated, with the Omicron variant representing about 61% and the Delta variant 38%, based on a limited sample as of 15 December, Dr Brian Monahan told lawmakers and staff in a 3 January letter. Some school systems around the US have extended their holiday break or switched back to online instruction because of the explosion in cases. Others pressed ahead with in-person classes amid a seemingly growing sense that Americans will have to learn to co-exist with the virus, armed with the vaccines that help prevent the spread and mitigate the severity of illness and the evolving range of tested treatments. Covid-19 has killed more than 820,000 people across the US. It has upended lives and livelihoods, disrupted education, left Americans feeling isolated, and at times sent the economy into free-fall. Mass holiday travel was a predictable recipe for yet another surge, similar to last winter. But nearly two years into the pandemic, the US was still woefully ill-equipped for such conditions and the Omicron variant, sending Americans scrambling to even find tests. Over the holiday season, thousands of flights were canceled because of Omicron-caused staffing shortages. Last week, the US smashed its record for Covid-19 infections reported in one day. Major companies are having to reconsider plans for employees to finally return to offices. Yet some experts and analysts still hope that Omicron will ultimately represent a move toward normalcy, where Covid-19 becomes a long-term reality but causes less devastation. “I think it’s likely that we’ll see this wave come and go and that the spring and summer will look a lot better than right now looks to us,” Ofer Levy, director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s hospital, told CNN. “There will be fewer cases, and then again, next fall and winter we’ll see a spike of viral illnesses, coronaviruses, influenza and others, but that it’ll be more like an endemic cycle.” Also on Monday, it was reported that the Manhattan district attorney has closed its investigation into former New York state governor Andrew Cuomo’s handling of nursing homes during the pandemic. The New York state health department said that Cuomo’s Covid-19 task force altered an official report and omitted 9,250 nursing home patients killed by coronavirus. Elkan Abramowitz, an attorney for Cuomo, said an investigation had concluded no laws were broken.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/us-covid-omicron-coronavirus-cases-florida

The Oakland, California, resident is the fourth-best all time winner, with $855,600 in earnings, and the first transgender person to qualify for Jeopardy’s Tournament of Champions, an annual event with the game’s top players. Schneider’s victories have catapulted her into the spotlight and made the engineering manager a beacon for LGBTQ+ visibility. “2021 wasn’t the best year for the world, but it turned out to be the best year I’ve ever had! Not only have I had this Jeopardy run, but I’ve heard from so many wonderful people,” Schneider said on Twitter. The 42-year-old, originally from Dayton, Ohio, said that since her victory streak had begun in November, people had recognized her at the grocery store. “It’s a fun feeling,” she said in an interview with Yahoo Entertainment. “I’m not going to be, like, Tom Hanks–level famous or anything! So, I think it’ll be manageable.” Schneider has said she’s dreamed of being a contestant on the show since age five. “I’ve always watched it and I’ve also always been interested in learning facts and stuff,” Schneider told Yahoo. “And as I mentioned on the show, in eighth grade I was voted most likely to be on Jeopardy! one day. It was always sort of in my mind that it might be something I did at some point.” Schneider has used Twitter and Instagram to chronicle her experience on the show, detailing the techniques she uses to tackle questions and recall facts about everything from the sinking of the Titanic to Major League Soccer teams, and her fashion choices, such as wearing a sweater to honor another high-ranking female Jeopardy! winner. The majority of her interactions online are positive, Schneider said, but she’s also faced anti-trans comments, to which she recently responded: “I’d like to thank all the people who have taken the time, during this busy holiday season, to reach out and explain to me that, actually, I’m a man. Every single one of you is the first person ever to make that very clever point, which had never once before crossed my mind.” Schneider has said she doesn’t “actually think about being trans all that often, and so when appearing on national television, I wanted to represent that part of my identity accurately: as important, but also relatively minor”. But her run on the show has had a major impact, families and advocates say. “Amy Schneider’s incredible run on Jeopardy! allows families all over the country to get to know her as someone who is great at word puzzles, has in-depth knowledge on a range of topics, and who also happens to be a transgender woman,” Nick Adams, Glaad’s director of transgender representation, said in a statement last month. “Amy is using her history-making appearances and new platform to raise awareness of transgender issues and share a bit of her personal story too.”;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/03/amy-schneider-jeopardy-record
5743;5743;Keir Starmer to unveil plan to build on Labour’s poll lead momentum;2022-01-03T22:30:04Z;['Aubrey Allegretti'];['Labour', 'Politics', 'Keir Starmer', 'UK news'];"Keir Starmer will launch his plan to maintain the momentum of Labour’s poll lead in the runup to the next election, accusing Boris Johnson of losing voters’ trust due to numerous sleaze scandals and treating power like a “branch of the entertainment industry”. Keen to progress from criticising the government to presenting his own team as a viable alternative, Starmer is expected to flesh out how Labour hopes to spend 2022 climbing closer to power. In a speech in Birmingham on Tuesday morning, the Labour leader will stress the importance of security, prosperity and respect, contrasted with months of what he called incompetent and untrustworthy behaviour by the prime minister. Johnson has been blighted by fury over alleged Downing Street Christmas parties in defiance of Covid rules, his botched bid to save a disgraced MP who broke lobbying rules from suspension, and an investigation into payments covering the renovation of his Downing Street flat. Labour has spent a month ahead in the polls for the first time in a year, while the Conservatives’ fall has sparked nervousness among Johnson’s ministers and backbenchers. Starmer’s party was also put 16 points ahead in a Deltapoll survey of 57 key “red wall” constituencies in its traditional heartlands, seen as crucial to winning back the keys to Downing Street. Starmer will seek to paint himself as a patriot, saying 2022 will show off “all that the British have to be proud of” in a bid to neutralise Johnson’s rebuttals that the Labour leader should get behind the government when criticising its handling of Covid.
“I don’t think you cease to be a patriot because you notice your country has flaws,” Starmer will says. “On the contrary, the reason we in this party want to correct those flaws is precisely because we are patriotic. I came into politics to make things happen, not just to talk about them. “I don’t think politics is a branch of the entertainment industry, I think it’s the serious business of getting things done. Heralding a “new phase” for the country, Starmer is expected to warn of a looming cost of living crisis, with energy bills set to rise, wages stagnant and tax rises on the horizon, with the national insurance rise coming into effect in the spring. He will also claim that many people feel unsafe on the streets and that they have to rely on “good luck” to get a quick GP appointment. Starmer will also acknowledge that a lapse in support for the Conservatives does not mean voters will automatically feel they have good reason to switch to Labour. He is set to say: “I am well aware that just because the Tories lose the public’s trust, it doesn’t mean Labour simply inherits it. Trust has to be earned. I am confident but not complacent about the task ahead.” Ahead of May’s local elections, and what Labour figures think could be the final party conference in September before the next general election, Starmer will stress that “the best still lies ahead for this country – but only if we have the courage to create a new Britain”. Johnson has been bullishly optimistic about the UK’s fortunes despite concern over whether fresh restrictions will be imposed due to the Omicron coronavirus variant. In his new year message, the prime minister insisted the country was in an “incomparably better” position than at the start of 2021.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/03/keir-starmer-to-unveil-plan-to-build-on-labours-poll-lead-momentum
5744;5744;China Evergrande shares suspended after order to demolish 39 buldings;2022-01-03T22:10:07Z;['Martin Farrer'];['Evergrande', 'China', 'Business', 'Asia Pacific'];"Shares in China’s Evergrande Group have been suspended from trading after the embattled property developer was told to demolish 39 buildings in a huge resort-style development in the southern province of Hainan. After initially giving no reason for the share halt, Evergrande confirmed late on Monday that it had received an order from authorities at Danzhou city in Hainan on 30 December telling it to demolish 39 under-construction buildings at the Ocean Flower Island project. It did not disclose the reason for the demolition order but local Chinese media reports said building permits for the lavish development on an artificially created island had been illegally obtained. The buildings cover 435,000 square metres and have been under construction for eight years, the reports added, citing an official notice to Evergrande’s unit in Hainan. Regulators in Danzhou city said in November that they would block Evergrande’s plan to repay debts to contractors and other creditors by giving them properties, Caixin reported. Evergrande is struggling to repay more than $300bn (£222bn) in liabilities, including nearly $20bn of international market bonds that were deemed to be in cross-default by ratings firms last month after it missed payments.
The property developer missed new coupon payments worth $255m due last Tuesday though both have a 30-day grace period. In common with a succession of incidences of missed payments in the final quarter of 2021, the company has not made any comment. The firm has set up a risk management committee with many members from state companies, and said it would actively engage with its creditors. On Friday, Evergrande dialled back plans to repay investors in its wealth management products, saying each investor in its wealth management product could expect to receive 8,000 yuan ($1,257) per month as principal payment for three months irrespective of when the investment matures. The move highlights the deepening liquidity squeeze at the property developer. Shares of Evergrande shed 89% last year, closing at HK$1.59 ($0.20; £0.15) on Friday. Its electric vehicle unit, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, plunged as much as 10% in early trading on Monday, while property management unit Evergrande Services declined 2.3%. Evergrande is not the only Chinese property developer engulfed by a liquidity crisis. Altogether the sector owes $19.8bn in US dollar-denominated offshore debt in the first three months of 2022, analysts at Nomura said last month. In the second quarter of this year, they must find another $18.5bn, while also meeting billions of repayments in local yuan debt. Other developers at risk of default include Kaisa, which missed a huge repayment in December and which has twice suspended its shares in recent months. Its stock has lost 75% in value in the past year. Analysts at S&P have estimated that one-third of Chinese developers could face a liquidity crunch in the next 12 months. Developers must also find 1.1tn yuan ($172bn) in backdated pay owed to construction workers before the lunar new year starts at the beginning of February.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/03/china-evergrande-shares-suspended-from-trading-in-hong-kong
5745;5745;Five great reads: a mysterious death at sea, dystopias set in 2022 and the joy of ugly fruit;2022-01-03T22:04:12Z;['Alyx Gorman'];['Australia news', 'Culture', 'Australian lifestyle', 'Fitness', 'Food'];"Good morning to everyone except those just returning from annual leave, to whom I offer my condolences instead. This is Five Great Reads, a weekday summer story wrap that does what it says on the tin, selected by me, Guardian Australia’s canned food, candles and courtship editor, Alyx Gorman. You might be getting this as an email – but if you’re not, you could be. Just pop your details in the box below.
Usually, at this point I’d be giving you a brief summary of today’s biggest headlines before moving on to the reads. But fortunately – for me at least – my colleagues at the Morning Mail have returned to work, so I’ll gladly leave that task in their expert hands. Spoiler: a lot of not-great stuff happening. But also, some great reads. Let’s talk about them! 1. Camera pans across a smouldering ruin. The year is 2022 For decades, directors have selected 2022 as a particularly ill-fated year. What can we learn from old movies, set in the present?
Which directors? What movies? Richard “Soylent Green is people” Fleischer, for one. Also the original Purge film, which actually came true a year and two days earlier than expected. Best descriptive phrase: “Admirably dumb eco-spectacle.” Bonus read: What with it feeling so close to home, contemporary apocalypse films are delivering a cinematic experience that’s less spectacular and more intimate. 2. A mysterious death at sea Arnold Latu was found dead in his berth. His is one of more than a dozen cases of fisheries observers dying on the job since 2009. Notable quote: “Latu’s death is still a mystery for us,” said his longtime friend Benny Jagroop. “So if you ask what [is] the speculation around Arnold’s death, for real I have no idea.” How long will it take me to read? About three minutes.
3. Exercising through back pain It helps! But it’s hard. Here’s a guide to getting started, from core-strengthening classes to moves you can do at home. Notable quote: “Any single treatment in low back pain is never enough by itself,” says Assoc Prof Michael Vagg, a pain medicine physician. “But exercise is a fundamental part of recovering from low back pain and managing it if it becomes persistent.” My back doesn’t hurt. Lucky you! But, if you are one of the millions of Australians living with another form of ongoing pain or illness, keep your eyes peeled. This story is part of a series How to move, and there’s more advice on exercise and chronic conditions coming. The first, which ran yesterday, tackled rheumatoid arthritis. 4. ‘The Hoodoo Gurus’ crew are stuck in the elevator’ The Go-Betweens’ Lindy Morrison on the gig she’ll never forget: Roskilde, 1987. Setting the scene: “I had bought the cookie from an ingratiating post-punk hippie. My musician mate disappears. I lean against a tent post.” I’m intrigued. How long is the read? Only two minutes or so. 5. An easy win: eating ugly fruit Why an imperfect produce box will get you eating fresher for less. But it’s a weird shape! A weird shape that fights food waste.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/five-great-reads-a-mysterious-death-at-sea-dystopias-set-in-2022-and-the-joy-of-ugly-fruit
5746;5746;Four Lives review – truly damning TV about those who are meant to protect and serve;2022-01-03T22:00:04Z;['Lucy Mangan'];['Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Drama', 'Sheridan Smith', 'Stephen Merchant', 'Crime', 'UK news', 'Police'];We’re getting to the point, surely, where television drama could be named the sixth estate. In the last year alone, we have had Deceit, probing the police ethics around the Rachel Nickell investigation, Frank Cottrell-Boyce’s Stephen, about the ongoing mishandling of the Stephen Lawrence case, Jimmy McGovern’s look at the prison system’s failures in Time, and Jack Thorne’s Help, telling, almost in real time, the story of care homes abandoned by government policy and the inhabitants left for dead as a result. All brought terrible injustices by those supposedly sworn to uphold the law and protect us – risibly old-fashioned though such phrases feel – to greater public prominence, and hopefully add to the pressure for holding to account those whose dereliction of duty at best, and corruption at worst, does society so much harm. Anne, a drama about the mother who fought through police denials and obstructions for the eventual unlawful killings verdict for the Hillsborough victims, is currently airing. And there are surely more in the works – perhaps on the murders of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman and the two officers sent to guard the scene, who took photos and shared the images on WhatsApp, or the murder by another officer of Sarah Everard (possibly including the breaking up of a peaceful vigil for her thereafter). The thin blue line refuses to run unerringly straight. And so to Four Lives (BBC One), about the murders of four young men by serial killer and rapist Stephen Port (a fine and chilling performance by Stephen Merchant) and a police investigation so fundamentally flawed that an inquest jury recently found that it probably contributed to three of the four deaths. The drama does a good job of making the victims – Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth, Jack Taylor (portrayed with depth, vigour and sweetness by Tim Preston, Jakub Svec, Leo Flanagan and Paddy Rowan, respectively) – live again. It shows them with the families and friends who will come to be the ones who follow leads and pull together most of the evidence necessary for Port’s eventual conviction, giving space to their relationships, and shape to everyone’s loss when it comes. Anthony, a fashion student who occasionally worked as an escort for extra cash, is the first to cross paths with Port. He is found dead outside the man’s flat after Port himself – posing as an anonymous citizen concerned about the apparently drunk young man – calls an ambulance. Beyond that, and despite the usual great work of Sheridan Smith (as Anthony’s mother, Sarah) and others, the drama never catches fire. It is doomed perhaps by the extremity of the police failures. News reports of the inquest jury findings are compelling reads – the list of things the police did not do, chose to ignore or failed to follow up is mind-boggling. Some of the most egregious examples (in a competitive field) make it into Four Lives. The Met’s insistence that there can be no link between the deaths of four young gay men by the same means and in the same locality – two of them found in the same graveyard, one with a suicide note the family says it (contrary to police claims) never identified as being in their son’s handwriting. No testing of the bed sheet he was found on. And, above all, no full interrogation of Stephen Port after a mobile phone trace revealed he was the anonymous caller, who also owned the flat Anthony’s body lay outside and gave a variety of inconsistent statements about how he came across him. Dramatically, it leaves the main characters little more to do than shout down the phone at disinterested officers and boggle at their unwillingness to chase what seems to them and us obvious leads and suspects. There seems to have been no coverup – just a long line of people who didn’t care enough how or why these young men, these sons, these friends, these lovers died. And, presumably, there was an element of deep-seated homophobia (though you also wonder, even if we take only recent headlines as our touchstones, just for whom the police do still bestir themselves and deem worthy of justice), which is of course awful – if not exactly shocking. Very few of the tangible failings are even mentioned in the first episode and we never see any behind-the-scenes work (or lack thereof) by the police. We are limited to the investigating officers’ inability to remember how to pronounce Anthony’s name (with the ‘th’ audible) and assumptions about his lifestyle, based on his occasional escort gigs and poppers found in his flat, to infer their lack of professionalism and humanity. But this kind of drama thrives on detail, not mere gesturings towards motive and should not depend on assumptions that right-minded viewers will draw the right conclusions.;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/03/four-lives-review-stephen-merchant-chilling-stephen-port-troubling-mind-boggling-drama-police-protect-and-serve
5747;5747;With Sydney hospitals in freefall, I’ve been forced to make an impossible decision about my sick, elderly dad | Anonymous;2022-01-03T21:54:40Z;['N/A'];['Health', 'New South Wales', 'Sydney', 'Omicron variant', 'Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'Hospitals'];"I spent a lot of time this past week googling “UTI” and “kidney infection”. Not because I got an enviable amount of action over the festive period but because my ailing 87-year-old dad with advanced Parkinson’s disease received the diagnosis and Mum and I were tasked with the impossible decision of sending him to an understaffed Sydney hospital riven with Covid or try to keep him alive at home ourselves. Dad fell ill at the worst possible time: just as GPs were going on holidays, pathology labs were turning off their lights for a few days, thousands of New South Wales healthcare staff were furloughed with Covid or as close contacts, and as the state’s coronavirus infections jumped 90% in 24 hours to a new daily high of 21,151. So when, last Thursday afternoon, Dad’s GP took one look at his symptoms and cloudy, blood-speckled urine sample and declared he had a kidney infection, our hearts went into freefall. With no time before the pathology lab shut for the holidays to determine which antibiotic would best treat his infection, his doctor gave him a prescription for something generic and potent, and told my elderly Mum with no medical acumen to “monitor his pee”. “If it still looks bad in 24 hours, call an ambulance and admit him to hospital.”
This was not my dad’s first brush with a misbehaving bladder – only four weeks before this he was admitted to a major Sydney hospital with a UTI where he was pumped with IV antibiotics, fluids and subjected to regular blood tests and imaging to ensure the meds were working and the infection hadn’t spread to the danger zone: his kidneys. UTIs often present differently in the elderly compared with younger people, with symptoms including vomiting, falls and major personality changes (see Logan Roy’s deranged response to a UTI in the last season of Succession). These infections can also quickly become deadly. Four weeks ago Dad received good care and was discharged in less than a week. Oh what a difference a few weeks, a new Covid variant and a mask-averse premier can make. The 24 hours after the GP’s ominous instructions were fraught. No one in the family could sleep and, as the last day of 2021 dawned, we monitored Dad’s pee like mad scientists. Friday evening rolled around and, as Sydney was gearing up for New Year’s Eve celebrations, it became apparent Dad’s urine was not improving and neither was he. So we called an ambulance. With visitors now shut out of hospitals and no phones beside patients’ beds, we feared these could be our last moments with Dad. We hastily sourced a simple mobile and tried to teach him how to use it but, having never used a computer before, let alone a touch-screen phone, he struggled to understand. His poor eyesight, his inability to control his fingers, his decimated short-term memory and the delirium from the infection made the task near-impossible, and I tried not to choke up as I repeated: “Just tap on the screen gently, don’t jab it.” The paramedics arrived and tried to put on a cheerful front. One of them was remarkably frank. He took one look at Dad, all shrivelled and gaunt in his wheelchair at the kitchen table, and said: “To be honest, I don’t want to send any geriatric to a Sydney hospital right now. Covid is everywhere – in staff and patients, and the staff shortages mean he won’t get the care he needs.” The paramedic suggested Mum and I try treating him at home, even though most GPs were closed until Tuesday, no one was answering calls on the national home doctor service line, and we had nothing but Google to guide us. He explained that because Dad had a kidney infection, he would initially be placed in the “hot room” of the hospital’s emergency department, where patients with any sort of infection, headache, diarrhoea, cold symptoms and fever were placed. AKA, the Covid room. (The “cold room”, the paramedic explained, was reserved for ailments such as broken limbs and heart attacks.) Mum and I glanced at each other, alarmed. The paramedic offered to call the triage nurse at the hospital’s emergency department to beg her not to place Dad in the room full of potential Covid patients. The nurse was sympathetic but explained it was hospital protocol. Also, given the number of patients in emergency that evening, Dad would be waiting in the hot room “for at least five hours” before he could be moved (provided he tested negative to Covid on arrival – we had performed a negative RAT test on him the day before). Dad sat there in the kitchen, not understanding what was going on, the N95 mask we had placed on him slipping off his nose and down his face. I imagined him sitting in the ED’s “hot room” with the mask half off, confused and tired and unable to sit upright in the chair or access a toilet or water. In that moment, Mum and I agreed to keep him at home. The past few days have been a nightmare. Armed with tap water, oral antibiotics, a thermometer and Google, we have monitored Dad’s every symptom or behavioural change. Sometimes he seems better; the next moment he is worse.
We feel guilty that we are not giving him the care he needs, guilty for keeping him out of hospital, but also horrified as we read the news stories about overwhelmed wards and mounting Covid cases. We don’t know yet if we have done the right thing. His GP is back on Tuesday, when the pathology labs reopen. We will know then whether our decision to keep him home has kept him safe or will kill him. I wonder how many other families are in the same position right now; how many other elders, vulnerable people, everyone who thought they were invincible but are not, are making these decisions about whether to put their lives in the hands of NSW hospitals.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/with-sydney-hospitals-in-freefall-ive-been-forced-to-make-an-impossible-decision-about-my-sick-elderly-dad
5748;5748;BlackBerry signals end of an era as it prepares to pull plug on classic phones;2022-01-03T21:40:45Z;['N/A'];['BlackBerry', 'Technology', 'Smartphones', 'US news'];"Tuesday marks the end of an era: BlackBerry will discontinue service on its classic smartphones. So for those still holding on to their QWERTY keyboards, be warned. In a 22 December statement, the company reminded users of the development, which will affect services for all of its devices not running on Android software, including the BlackBerry 10, 7.1 OS and earlier. “As of this date, devices running these legacy services and software through either carrier or Wi-Fi connections will no longer reliably function, including for data, phone calls, SMS and 9-1-1 functionality,” the statement says. Boasting a physical keyboard and BBM instant messaging, the BlackBerry was once a powerplayer in the cell phone world. In the first decade of the 2000s, the devices were toted with pride by white-collar professionals and then-President Barack Obama alike.
At its peak in 2009 and 2010, BlackBerry owned nearly 20% of the global smartphone market – with an even higher percentage in the US – selling more than 50m smartphones a year. But with the rise of the iPhone and Android touchscreen devices, the phone eventually fell out of style. And unless it warrants a reboot like the T-Mobile Sidekick or Motorola Razr, it seems that BlackBerry’s moment in the sun has passed. When the iPhone first launched in June 2007, it didn’t immediately overtake BlackBerry’s reign. With an elite status and user-friendly reputation, businesspeople especially, stayed loyal to the product. BlackBerry’s BBM instant messaging system also remained a user favorite feature, boasting the same cachet and ease of iMessage today. Soon, though, BlackBerry’s technology fell behind and users began to make the move away from physical keyboards. BlackBerry launched a series of poorly received devices as the iPhone leveled up and Androids became viable alternatives. After the release of the iPhone 4, Apple’s phone sales passed BlackBerry’s for good. By the time BlackBerry’s technology began to catch up, it was out of fashion. Working professionals, one of BlackBerry’s core customer bases, began to make the switch to iPhones and Androids. In September 2012, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer snubbed the devices by asking that employees transition “from BlackBerries to smartphones”. By 2016, BlackBerry announced it would outsource its product and no longer manufacture its own phones. Instead, the company made a move to pivot into software, similar to Nokia, another former cellular giant. Today, BlackBerry bills itself primarily as “an enterprise software and cybersecurity company” developing software solutions for corporations. The company still employs thousands of workers and pulled in about a billion dollars in revenue in 2020, according to Statista.";https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/03/blackberry-discontinue-service-classic
5749;5749;Manchester United failed ‘individually and collectively’, says Ralf Rangnick;2022-01-03T21:17:27Z;['Jamie Jackson'];['Manchester United', 'Ralf Rangnick', 'Wolverhampton Wanderers', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Ralf Rangnick hit out at Manchester United for their individual and collective failure during a 1-0 defeat against Wolves on Monday night, with the interim manager admitting he cannot guarantee a top-four finish, while Luke Shaw questioned the unity of senior players. United’s first defeat in the German’s sixth match in charge meant the visitors broke a 42-year sequence without a league win at United due to João Moutinho’s 82nd-minute winner. While it lifted Bruno Lage’s side to eighth, United are only a place higher, four points behind Arsenal in the final Champions League spot. Rangnick said: “We didn’t play well at all individually or collectively. Today we showed similar problems the team had three or four weeks ago before I arrived. It is not an easy job to develop a DNA with and without the ball.”
The 63-year-old was asked if United can finish in the top four. “I cannot make any guarantees,” he said. “Look at today’s performance: if I say we are 100% convinced we will finish in the top four I don’t know if people will believe that. It is about taking the next steps and getting better. I knew this could be hard. “I knew it would be difficult – that’s the reason why they brought me. I knew it wouldn’t be easy to find a balance between offensively and defensively. We didn’t press at all. We tried but we were not able to get into those pressing situations.” Shaw was scathing, questioning the togetherness of a core of senior players in the XI that included him, Cristiano Ronaldo, Edinson Cavani, Raphaël Varane, Bruno Fernandes, and Nemanja Matić. “Us players [who] we have been here a long time, maybe tonight we struggled,” the defender said. “I didn’t think we were all there together. You look at the players we have, we have unbelievable quality but sometimes quality is not enough. “They were miles better in the first half. We let them take control of the game, we weren’t aggressive, we needed to bring more intensity. Maybe we lacked that today. We need to bring the intensity and more motivation. “Inside the dressing room we know what we want but out on the pitch we need to give 100%. To win these types of games we all need to be 100% committed. It is tough and disappointing.”
Rangnick was noticeably booed when he removed Mason Greenwood in the second half. “The question was shall I take off Mason or shall I take off Edi [Cavani],” he said. “We decided to keep Edi as the more offensive. “It shows how high the fans like Mason as a homegrown player. His effort and performance was not outstanding but he was one of the better players today,” he said. Moutinho, who celebrated his goal in the style of Bebeto, said: “I have a baby that is three months old and the goal is for my wife and two daughters. I had to wait nine months and three months more to be able to do this celebration.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/manchester-united-failed-individually-and-collectively-says-ralf-rangnick
5750;5750;Radical change is needed to stop the Ashes ending up a fading museum piece;2022-01-03T21:00:03Z;['Jonathan Liew'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'England cricket team', 'Australia cricket team', 'The Ashes', 'Cricket', 'Australia sport', 'Sport'];"Even with the Ashes gone, the inquests under way and his future under the spotlight, Joe Root was talking a good game ahead of the Sydney Test. “For us it’s a must-win game,” he said. “I know the series isn’t winnable, but it’s a good opportunity.” On the Australian side, meanwhile, Steve Smith was urging his team to turn the screw by making it 4-0. “We’ve wrapped up the series which is great, and we want to continue winning,” he said. “That’s important.” So far so routine, although in the spirit of transparency it seems fair to point out that the above quotes were taken not from the current series, but from the corresponding mismatch in January 2018, four years ago to the day. Well, they do say one of the best things about Test cricket is its timelessness.
And so once again the Ashes circus arrives in Sydney smelling faintly of rust, ennui and elephant shit, as players and broadcasters desperately try to inject a little jeopardy into this long-moribund series. Nathan Lyon insists there is no such thing as a “dead rubber when you’re wearing the baggy green”. There are World Test Championship points at stake, after all, and places for the forthcoming tour of New Zealand to be contested. As for England, the quadrennial fit of introspection and ritual bloodletting, the comforting fixation on County Championship schedules and ball manufacturers, has perhaps obscured the wider implications of another hopelessly unequal encounter. This is, we are constantly told, a flagship series: a yardstick for the health of the game as a whole. What, then, does it say when India and South Africa are currently serving up a more compelling show than anything seen in Australia over the last month? This is hardly a new phenomenon, either. It is 39 years since a men’s Ashes series in Australia reached its final Test with the fate of the urn in the balance. In England it has happened just twice in my lifetime – in 2005 and 2009. The lack of alarm over this should be alarming in itself. The bare minimum we demand of sport is that it has consequence. Yet by the end of this series, 27 of the last 88 Ashes Tests will essentially have been cold product, nothing riding on them but pride and broadcasting contracts. Is there not a better way of doing this? Part of the issue is that Test cricket itself has changed. Five-match series made sense in previous eras because of the frequency of draws and washouts. No such need exists these days. The last 23 Ashes Tests have produced two draws. That drops to one from the last 32 in Australia, home of some of the most favourable batting conditions in world cricket. Increasingly a five-match series – particularly where one team is demonstrably worse than the other – feel like an elaborate form of torture, a way of forcing imploding teams to keep imploding until there is nothing left. Even a theoretically-close series gains little from being drawn out over its full length. Both the 2015 and 2019 series felt pale and drained by their conclusion, and not in a good way: flawed sides taking wild swings at each other, exhausted players desperately trying to cling to the precipice.
The virtue of a long series used to be in their ebb and flow, the possibility of redemption and learning. But with schedules trimmed to the skeleton and warm-up games hunted to extinction, that hardly happens any more. The simplest solution would be to cut the Ashes down to three or four Tests, perhaps with an optional decider in the case of a tie. But there is a more radical alternative out there, taking its inspiration from the women’s Ashes, which has flourished since switching to a multi-format competition in 2013. Three Tests, three one-day internationals, three Twenty20s: the overall winner being either the first to a certain number of points, or to win two series.
Fewer days of cricket overall, but a more varied and textured challenge, and arguably a truer test of systems and cultures, which at its heart is what the Ashes was originally supposed to be about. Teams would be forced to strike a balance between red and white-ball structures, between specialists and all-format players. Bigger squads and more rest days would give the series a chance to breathe in a packed calendar. At least once a decade we would probably be treated to the sight of the Ashes being decided in the final over. And really, we need to decide what we want this cherished and venerable competition to be in the modern age. A museum piece, a fading heritage tour, a sort of fancy dress historical re-enactment that bears less and less resemblance to the cutting edge of the sport with every passing iteration? At the very least, it’s time to consider whether five compressed five-day Tests every couple of years really is the best way to settle and sell this oldest of rivalries. (You could, if you were feeling particularly daring, even combine men’s and women’s Ashes under a single banner.) Or, alternatively, we can keep rocking up in Sydney every four years with empty platitudes and crossed fingers, hoping that things will be different this time. And maybe they will. Doing nothing is certainly an option. But as the game fractures and old certainties erode, it’s increasingly hard to argue it’s the best one.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/03/cricket-ashes-radical-change-needed-england-australia
5752;5752;Broken sewer line spills millions of gallons of waste into streets of California city;2022-01-03T20:39:20Z;['Gabrielle Canon'];['Infrastructure', 'California', 'US news', 'Environment'];A large cleanup effort is under way in Los Angeles county after an estimated 8.5m gallons of raw sewage flooded through a neighborhood in the city of Carson, closing beaches and leaving toilet paper, feces and toxic residue strewn across nearby streets and sidewalks. The spill occurred last Thursday when a 60-year-old sewer line failed, spewing sewage from a manhole and into the Dominguez Channel, a 15-mile flood-control waterway that eventually pours into the Pacific Ocean. The failed 48-inch sewer main was due to be replaced within the year and was probably strained after strong rainstorms pelted southern California. LA county supervisor Janice Hahn has called for a full investigation into the cause of the spill, the largest on record for the area. “A sewage spill of this magnitude is dangerous and unacceptable, and we need to understand what happened,” Hahn said in a statement. “The recent storm undoubtedly contributed to the spill but we need infrastructure that doesn’t fail when it rains.” City officials said Monday that beaches in nearby Long Beach will remain closed as water quality testing continues. Several beaches in Los Angeles and Orange counties were closed over the weekend after the spill and surfing, swimming and holiday events like the annual Polar Bear Swim – where locals have enjoyed a frigid New Year’s dip at Cabrillo beach for the past 70 years – had to be canceled. Hahn, who called the event a “treasured local tradition”, added that “canceling it is a terrible way to start off the year”. The spill occurred just months after another environmental disaster affected the residents of Carson, a city that sits just north of Long Beach and south of downtown Los Angeles. The Dominguez Channel was recently plagued by an overpowering odor, described by residents as “the stench of death”, that caused headaches, respiratory problems and other health problems. Officials have attributed the odor to a warehouse fire that leeched chemicals into the 15-mile canal, killing plants and unleashing high amounts of hydrogen sulfide, also known as sewer gas. The sewage flow has been stopped according to the Los Angeles County Sanitation District, and abnormal hydrogen sulfide levels were not detected in the area. The agency said that the affected streets and storm drains had been cleaned, and it will reimburse residents for car washes. Meanwhile, crews are still working to repair the pipe. As of Sunday, LA County Sanitation District said plans were in place to “slip-line” the pipe, a process where a smaller 42-inch corrosion-resistant pipe is placed inside the 48-inch sewer, but that the materials wouldn’t be delivered until later in the week. The process has been complicated by the line’s position near a freeway, which has also caused offramp closures. This wasn’t the first time sewage spilled on to these streets of Carson. Resident Cesar Casillas told Fox11 Los Angeles it was the second spill that he and his neighbors have dealt with in five years. “It’s something you don’t want to see ever,” Casillas said, describing the noxious smell that lingered days into the cleanup effort. “There is still toilet paper smudged into the soil,” he added. “My children can’t play out here – I don’t think it’s safe.”;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/03/broken-sewer-line-spills-waste-into-california-city
5753;5753;Apple becomes first US company to reach $3tn valuation;2022-01-03T20:02:38Z;['Dominic Rushe', 'Jillian Ambrose'];['Apple', 'Stock markets', 'Business', 'Computing', 'Technology', 'World news', 'US news'];Apple became the first US company to be valued at over $3tn on Monday as the tech company continued its phenomenal share price growth, tripling in value in under four years. A pandemic-era surge in tech stocks has driven the major US tech companies to new highs, pulling US stock markets with them. Apple became the world’s first trillion dollar company in August 2018, passed $2tn in 2020 and hit its new high as trading began after the holidays and its shares passed $182.80 a piece before dipping lower to end the day valued at over $2.9tn. Apple alone is now more valuable than the combined values of Boeing, Coca-Cola, Disney, Exxon-Mobil, McDonald’s, Netflix and Walmart. Its shares have risen 38% since the beginning of 2021, one of the largest gains on the Dow Jones industrial average stock market index. The company released its last quarterly earnings in October and made a profit of $20.6bn over the previous three months despite suffering from Covid-related supply chain issues. It is unlikely to remain the only $3tn company as analysts expect Microsoft will also hit the mark later this year. The news came as US markets edged higher and European shares bounded to record highs in the first day of trading in 2022 as investors bet on a steady economic recovery despite the rising number of Covid-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant. Europe’s benchmark stock index, the Stoxx 600, rose to a record intraday high of 491.73 points on Monday, surpassing its November peak of 490.58, as global oil and equity markets climbed. It later closed at 489.99, up 0.45%. The Stoxx 600 recorded a 22.4% jump last year, its second-best yearly performance in over a decade, after the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and government stimulus spending encouraged investors to pour money back into the markets. The share price of airlines Lufthansa and Air France–KLM were two of the biggest climbers across Europe’s equity markets after analysts at Citi forecast that the reopening of travel routes to Asia could help bolster the beleaguered travel sector. Lufthansa shares rose by almost 8.9% to €6.73 a share, and Air France KLM rose by 4.9% to €4.06. Europe’s record start to the new year set the stage for US markets to continue their late 2021 recovery. The opening of the S&P 500 index, which climbed by 26.9% last year, was bolstered by a 9% jump in Tesla shares after the company’s quarterly deliveries exceeded expectations. In another boost to US markets global oil prices, which last year recorded their biggest annual rise since at least 2016, resumed their rise towards $80 a barrel as fears that emerged late last year over the impact of the Omicron variant waned. The oil price helped shares in US oil majors Chevron and ExxonMobil climb by 1% each. The London Stock Exchange (LSE), which has lagged behind its European and US rivals by climbing 14.3% last year, was closed on Monday for the new year bank holiday. The FTSE 100 has been criticised as “old-fashioned” due to its dearth of tech companies and a glut of oil and bank stocks. It remained 6.5% below its May 2018 peak last year while the US, German and French markets all hit record highs. Sean Darby, a global equity strategist at Jefferies, said: “Although Covid-19 variants permeated the global economy, 2021 was the year of records with many bourses closing at or near record highs, while inflows into equities surpassed their largest accumulation ever. Peering into 2022, we expect volatility to rise.” Global oil markets are also expected to face ongoing volatility in the year ahead as traders balance the risk that the Omicron variant may stall a rebound in demand for transport fuels, against uncertain supplies from the world’s biggest oil producers. • This article was amended on 5 January 2022. The S&P 500 index rose by 26.9% last year, not a record 47.7% as an earlier version said. The latter figure relates specifically to the S&P 500 energy index.;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/03/apple-becomes-first-us-company-to-reach-3tn-valuation
5754;5754;‘It’s a mystery for us’: the puzzling death at sea of a Tongan fisheries observer;2022-01-03T20:00:01Z;['Bernadette Carreon'];['Tonga', 'Fishing', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news', 'Pacific islands'];"On the morning of Monday 27 September, a crew member on board the Hsinlong 1 fishing vessel went to fetch his friend Arnold Latu for breakfast. Latu, in his mid-30s, was the monitoring officer of the Chinese-owned, Fiji-flagged vessel, employed by the Tongan government to check that the amount of fish caught on its three-week voyage was legal and correctly recorded. The Hsinlong 1 had almost completed its work and was berthed close to Pangaimotu Island, off the shores of Nuku’alofa, awaiting the OK from local authorities to berth at the Tuimatamoana fishing wharf.
“We were just about to have breakfast and get ready for the vessel to go in to the wharf to berth and one of the crew members had gone to call Latu to come and have breakfast,” said a senior crew member onboard the vessel at the time, who did not wish to be named. “The crew member shouted to us that Latu was not responding to his calls and was lying on his bed. We went in and touched his body which was already cold. We were shocked and did not know what to do.” Latu’s friends remember him as a hard worker, a friendly person who got along with everyone, and a “good listener and one who is always keen to help anyone”. He was also described as a “marine man” who loved the seas and his job at Fisheries.
His longtime friend Benny Jagroop, who was not on the vessel, described him as a “little brother” who came from a tough neighbourhood, but worked with a local group called Falepiliki (brick house) to try to support young men to stay in school, and stay out of trouble. “Latu’s death is still a mystery for us,” said Jagroop. “So if you ask what [is] the speculation around Arnold’s death, for real I have no idea.” After they found him dead, crew members alerted the ship’s captain, and Tongan police were contacted. But nearly three months later and despite calls for a transparent investigation from international bodies, there are no answers about what caused the apparently healthy man’s death, and neither police, nor the government of Tonga were willing to speak about the case. Dr Tuikolongahau Halafihi, chief executive of Tonga’s Ministry of Fisheries, said they were not able to release any information because the case was still being investigated by Tonga police. “I won’t be able to give you any information about this case as we are still awaiting the report from police and health. We are still after this report but it’s still with the police,” he said in an email response to questions from the Guardian. Tonga police did not reply to requests for comment. Despite calls from non-government organisations like WWF and the Association of Professional Observers (APO), the cause of death and results of the postmortem examination have not been revealed by authorities. The WWF wrote about Latu in its December position paper, saying that there had been no report of the cause of death, nor was there any information to “suggest he was sick or injured” before his death. Bubba Cook, WWF western and central Pacific tuna programme manager, called for transparency and a thorough investigation of any reported deaths or incidents involving fisheries observers. “In the case of any missing human, from a vessel, [if] there’s a death of anyone, whether it’s crew member or a fisheries observer, there should be an investigation into that fatality. And it should be a thorough investigation and the information about that should be made public,” he said. Hsinlong Fisheries Ltd, the owner of Hsinlong 1, did not respond to detailed questions from the Guardian. Nor did Tonga police. ‘If you’re not protecting all, you’re not protecting any’ There is no evidence of foul play in Latu’s death, however the uncertainty as to how he died has attracted the attention of the WWF and the APO, which monitor the safety of fishing observers around the world. Being an observer, which involves monitoring fishing practices and catches to make sure boats follow the rules, is a dangerous job that can put observers in conflict with the crews on the vessels on which they are working – often hundreds, or even thousands, of kilometres from the nearest port. According to the Association for Professional Observers, there have been more than a dozen cases of observers dying on the job since 2009 alone, including a number from the Pacific. Eritara Aati Kaierua from Kiribati died onboard a fishing vessel in 2020. His family have serious concerns about the investigation conducted into his death. Antin Tamwabeti, also from Kiribati, died on another boat in May 2019, in circumstances which have not been reported, though his case was ruled a suicide. According to the company that hired him, he was harassed and threatened by the crew of the Taiwanese-flagged boat he was on shortly before his death. The WWF has argued that Latu’s death has “exposed a significant potential weakness in regional observer safety and security measures related to jurisdictional ambiguity”. Because Latu’s deployment was classified as a national trip and the vessel was fishing in Tonga’s waters, Latu was not given safety equipment that he would have been given if the trip had been in international waters and had fallen within the context of a Regional Observer Programme trip. But the WWF says this should not matter. “We’ve made good advancements to addressing the safety issues with observers … but they didn’t go far enough,” said Cook. “And I think that’s evidenced by Arnold Latu’s situation, because he was on a national trip, there was some jurisdictional ambiguity around who was responsible, on what rules are subject to with respect to safety. And our position is, if you’re not protecting all of the observers, you’re not protecting any of them.” In a document shared with the Guardian by the Association for Professional Observers (APO), Samuela Bulimetuira, the manager of safety compliance and response at the Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji, wrote that since Latu’s death occurred in Tongan waters, Tonga was responsible for investigating. Tonga and the company that owned the vessel “have an obligation to report all incidents especially deaths onboard to the Flag State Authority [Fiji] as soon as is practicable”. Bulimetuira did not respond to questions from the Guardian.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/its-a-mystery-for-us-the-puzzling-death-at-sea-of-a-tongan-fisheries-observer
5756;5756;Five of world’s most powerful nations pledge to avoid nuclear war;2022-01-03T19:54:34Z;['Julian Borger'];['Nuclear weapons', 'United Nations', 'World news', 'US news', 'Russia', 'China', 'UK news', 'France'];"Five of the world’s most powerful nations have agreed that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought” in a rare joint pledge to reduce the risk of such a conflict ever starting. The pledge was signed by the US, Russia, China, the UK and France, the five nuclear weapons states recognised by the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) who are also the five permanent members of the UN security council. They are known as the P5 or the N5. Such a common statement on a major issue of global security has become a rarity at a time of increasing friction between Russia, China and the west. With Moscow threatening to invade Ukraine and China signaling its readiness to use military force against Taiwan, the joint statement represents a renewed commitment to prevent any confrontation turning into a nuclear catastrophe.
A senior US state department official said the wording of the statement had been hammered out at P5 meetings over several months, despite the high-tension environment. “At the base level to be able to say that this is how we think about these risks, and this is an acknowledgement that it is something that we want to avoid, particularly during a difficult time, I think is noteworthy,” the official said. The release of the statement had been timed to coincide with the five-yearly review conference of the NPT, but that conference has been postponed amid the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, and disagreements on whether the session could be held virtually. “We affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,” the statement said, echoing a joint declaration by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev at a 1985 summit in Geneva. The NPT was a bargain between states without nuclear weapons, who pledged not to acquire them, and the five nuclear-armed states, which promised to disarm. The review conference, originally planned for 2020, was expected to be contentious as a result of the stalling of momentum towards disarmament and the moves made by the five weapons states to modernise their arsenals. Four other countries with nuclear weapons not recognised under NPT – Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea – have also shown no signs of reducing their stockpiles. Meanwhile, the breakdown of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and the deadlock so far in attempts to salvage it, have raised the risks of nuclear proliferation, particularly in the Middle East. Monday’s joint statement was aimed at improving the atmosphere at the NPT review conference. China’s vice-foreign minister, Ma Zhaoxu, welcomed Monday’s statement as “positive and weighty”, adding it would “help increase mutual trust and replace competition among major powers with coordination and cooperation”. It took several months of negotiation over the wording of the declaration before all five powers were ready to agree. France in particular had concerns that such a statement would undermine the deterrent effect of its arsenal. “France has a nuclear doctrine reserving the right to use nuclear weapons as a “final warning” to warn off an aggressor or even a state sponsor of terrorism”, said Oliver Meier, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy. Meier said the UK’s reservations were not so clearly expressed but he believed them to be similar. A line in the joint statement saying that “nuclear weapons – for as long as they continue to exist – should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression, and prevent war,” was added to address French concerns. The five nuclear weapons powers also stated that the “reduction of strategic risks”, making sure global tensions never lead to nuclear conflict, was one of their “foremost responsibilities”. “We underline our desire to work with all states to create a security environment more conducive to progress on disarmament,” the statement said. A senior US official said the declaration was the result “of a good and substantive and constructive conversation about how to reduce nuclear threats and eventually eliminate them”.
“Given the security environment, I’m pretty shocked that the P5 could agree to this much,” Heather Williams, a senior lecturer in defence studies at King’s College London, said. Williams and other nuclear experts have urged the nuclear weapons powers to improve their channels of crisis communications as one of the ways of reducing risks of an unplanned clash escalating into nuclear conflict. Arms control advocates widely welcomed the declaration but called for it to be backed up by a return to disarmament. “With nine nuclear arsenals currently being enhanced, and Covid problems besetting nuclear-armed submarines and facilities, this statement from five of the nuclear-armed leaders is welcomed, but does not go far enough,” said Rebecca Johnson, the vice president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the first president of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. “As long as nuclear weapons continue to be advertised and wielded by some, we are all put at risk of nuclear war.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/five-nations-pledge-avoid-nuclear-war
5757;5757;US twins delivered just minutes apart end up being born in two different years;2022-01-03T19:47:29Z;['Alexandra Villarreal'];['California', 'US news', 'Children'];Twins in Salinas, California were born 15 minutes apart but won’t share a birthday – or even the same birth year. Aylin Yolanda Trujillo was delivered at Natividad medical center at exactly midnight on 1 January. She was the first baby born in Monterey county in 2022, as the US west coast ushered in a new year. But her brother, Alfredo Antonio Trujillo, had arrived just before her, at 11.45pm on 31 December, as 2021 came to a close. “It’s crazy to me that they are twins and have different birthdays,” said Aylin and Alfredo’s mother, Fatima Madrigal. “I was surprised and happy that she arrived at midnight.” Aylin was born a healthy 5lb 14oz, while Antonio weighed in at 6lb 1oz. The twins, from Greenfield, California, have two older sisters and an older brother, who was said to be excited for another boy to join the family. Photos showed both babies with their eyes closed, swaddled in matching striped blankets and wearing pink-striped beanies. The chance of twins being born on different days, months and years is relatively low. While there were about 3.75m births in the US in 2019, only about 120,000 – or about 3% – were twins, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Twin deliveries that straddle the narrow window of time between the last seconds of December and first moments of January are even less common. “This was definitely one of the most memorable deliveries of my career,” said Ana Abril Arias, a family doctor at Natividad medical group. “It was an absolute pleasure to help these little ones arrive here safely in 2021 and 2022. What an amazing way to start the New Year!”;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/03/twins-born-minutes-apart-born-two-different-years
5758;5758;Moutinho’s strike earns Wolves deserved victory against insipid United;2022-01-03T19:46:23Z;['Jamie Jackson'];['Premier League', 'Manchester United', 'Wolverhampton Wanderers', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Manchester United appear to be a work not in progress but regression. Ralf Rangnick is overseeing a team who set out with a structure against Crystal Palace, his first game in charge, but have since slid slowly backwards. João Moutinho’s sweet 82nd-minute volley handed Wolves a first league win at Old Trafford since 1980 while starting an inquest into where United are headed under an interim manager whose two main tenets seem to have gone awol. First, the “godfather of pressing” seems, oddly, to have eschewed his beloved mode of intensive shutting down. Second, the 4-2-2-2 to which he adheres has become aimless and misshapen. Before Moutinho crashed home – from a Phil Jones headed clearance – Romain Saïss hit a free-kick off the excellent David de Gea’s bar. United had existed in a quasi-survival mode for the entire game, which is hardly how to prosper. This, though, is precisely what Wolves did, moving to eighth place, one behind Rangnick’s side, courtesy of scintillating team play and the brilliance of Moutinho who, at 35 years and 117 days, is the oldest player to score a Premier League winner at United. “What I want is to help the team,” he said. “Winning here at Old Trafford is amazing for us. Phil Jones headed out the ball – I said I need to shoot: a beautiful goal.”
Jones’s first appearance since January 2020 – an FA Cup tie, 707 days ago – vied with Bruno Fernandes’s failure to be reinstated following a one-game suspension, as the headline team news. Jones, who suffered a string of injuries including a serious knee problem, was chosen because of the unavailability of Victor Lindelöf, Harry Maguire and Eric Bailly – the first two with knocks, the latter because of Covid – as the 29-year-old partnered Raphaël Varane in central defence. Fernandes’s non-selection was different: an uneven season featuring five goals, plus United’s win against Burnley here last time out, meant Rangnick felt neither Mason Greenwood nor Jadon Sancho should make way for a footballer who has, in essence, been the de facto captain. From the opening kick United were forced to ball-watch. And when they did wrest hold of it Cristiano Ronaldo, captain for the night, and Luke Shaw were both careless. But Greenwood showed the way: a Nemanja Matic chest-and-pass to the youngster was as slick as the latter’s skip infield and arrow into Sancho. This had him bursting in on goal, and though his shot disappointed – and ignored the overlapping Ronaldo – United hoped this might settle them. But no: the rest of the contest was dire from them, as De Gea again emerged as their finest performer. Jones – until the error that allowed the winner – also impressed, following one commanding header with an intercept of a Nélson Semedo crossfield ball. The former England man, though, was unable to stop Daniel Podence’s run-then-shot which forced De Gea into a sharp save. From the subsequent corner United’s goalkeeper next had to leap towards his top right-hand corner to repel Rúben Neves when he blazed from 20 yards out. Wolves were a blur of gold. Podence nipped in and Aaron Wan‑Bissaka toed the ball out for another corner. When United threatened a breakaway from this, Jones passed straight into touch. “Control” has been Rangnick’s mantra yet United enjoyed zero. After Semedo became the latest Wolves man to burn De Gea’s fingers from close range, a sequence involving Ronaldo, Scott McTominay and Wan-Bissaka ended in Sancho’s effort being blocked. Podence next slipped by Jones, swivelled, and tested De Gea’s reflexes with nothing close to the Rangnick high press in evidence. When Semedo did exactly this on Sancho suddenly Raúl Jiménez was keeping De Gea honest – once more – from distance.
Remarkable, too, was how Edinson Cavani, McTominay, Wan-Bissaka and Ronaldo could commit schoolboy howlers. The right-back did so in a phase that allowed Wolves to break before Ronaldo’s intended backpass of a header went close to setting-up Jiménez for the opener. A Cavani 30-yard attempt that sailed over José Sá’s goal summed up United before the interval: toothless. Francisco Trincão being stymied at the death by Jones at close range was Wolves in microcosm: impressive. So the visitors continued in the second half. Podence and Jiménez were thorns up-front and a Saïss 50-yard surge from centre-back posed United another problem. Only Greenwood’s rapier thrusts appeared to offer the insipid home outfit a chance of what would be a shock strike yet when Fernandes came on it was the England youngster who was hooked.
This caused boos and Rangnick’s thought-process baffled – Sancho had been far less effective. Still, Fernandes soon crashed the ball off Sá’s bar, and Ronaldo headed in – he was offside – then hit a chance wide when racing clear. These misses were costly – Fernandes had an added-time free-kick beaten away by Sá, too. By the final whistle, huge credit had to go to Bruno Lage and his team. But Rangnick now has to show what he possesses as this was the poorest outing yet under him. He may wish to point to the five unbeaten matches before this reverse, but all of these were against moderate opposition.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/manchester-united-wolves-premier-league-match-report
5759;5759;NHS trusts in England declare critical incidents amid Covid staff crisis;2022-01-03T19:40:55Z;['Andrew Gregory', 'Peter Walker', 'Robert Booth'];['NHS', 'Hospitals', 'Coronavirus', 'Health policy', 'London', 'Health', 'Politics', 'Society', 'UK news', 'Nursing'];"Multiple NHS trusts across England have declared “critical incidents” amid soaring staff absences caused by Covid-19, with health leaders saying many parts of the service are now “in a state of crisis”. Boris Johnson on Monday ruled out the introduction of new curbs “for now” but said he recognised that the pressure on the NHS and its hospitals, was “going to be considerable in the course of the next couple of weeks, and maybe more”. More than half a dozen trusts have issued alerts over “internal critical incidents” in recent days, it is understood, as concerns mount that some may be unable to deliver vital care to patients. Health leaders said the “rapidly increasing” number of absent NHS staff was piling “very serious” pressure on hospitals already struggling to cope with increasing Covid admissions and “huge wider pressure” on urgent and emergency services.
They said pressure was increasingly spreading to hospitals outside London, with those in the north-east and Yorkshire reporting the most rapid growth in Covid patient numbers in recent days. Johnson said there was no question Omicron continued “to surge through the country”, adding it would be folly to think the pandemic was over. A further 157,758 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases have been recorded in England and Scotland as of 9am on Monday, the government said. However, speaking publicly for the first time this year during a visit to a vaccination centre in Aylesbury, Johnson said the UK remained in a much better position than this time last year thanks to vaccines and stressed Omicron was “plainly milder” than previous variants. NHS chiefs also expressed cautious optimism that after weeks of rising hospitalisations in London – the centre of the Omicron outbreak – the increases may have peaked and are starting to level off. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS hospital, mental health, community and ambulance services, said: “We were seeing increases in the number of Covid-19 patients in London hospitals go up by 9% a day, 15% a day …  in terms of 27, 28 and 29 December. “Interestingly, in the last two days the increases have only been 1% and 2%, so they’ve dropped pretty significantly, so there’s a hope we might have seen a possible peak and plateau.” Another piece of positive news, he added, was that hospitals were still not admitting large numbers of seriously ill older people with Covid. Hopson said it was striking that hospital bosses were “pointing to the fact” that outbreaks in care homes were not translating into hospital admissions. One of the UK’s biggest care home operators called on the government to lift visiting restrictions after it recorded one Covid death in the last fortnight. Four Seasons Healthcare, which operates 165 care homes, said close to 4,000 residents were living under strict lockdowns because of outbreaks, but Omicron was proving so mild in a well-vaccinated population that limits on seeing family and friends were in “total imbalance” with the risk. Hopson cautioned that the biggest challenge facing many NHS trusts – like many workplaces across the country in the first week of the new year – was mounting staff absences. Covid-related staff shortages are causing havoc in many sectors, with bins in some areas “overflowing” with waste from the festive period and schools scrambling to hire substitute teachers for the start of the new term. Hopson said a number of trusts across the country had declared “internal critical incidents” over the past few days. United Lincolnshire hospitals NHS trust declared a critical incident with “extreme and unprecedented” staff shortages resulting in “compromised care”. Critical incidents are declared by NHS trusts when they believe they may no longer be able to provide a range of critical services. Declaring an incident enables local health chiefs to call for help from staff and other organisations, and creates a formal interim emergency governance structure to make prioritisation decisions at speed, for example redeploying staff or reprioritising services. Joe Harrison, the chief executive of Milton Keynes University hospital, said while his trust was not yet declaring a critical incident, he expected the “very pressured” situation to get worse before it got better. Meanwhile, in Yorkshire, the ambulance service said: “The added challenge of Covid-19-related absence among staff … is having a significant impact on our frontline operations.” In a blog published on Monday, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, issued a stark warning that many parts of the health service were “currently in a state of crisis”. “In the face of high levels of demand and staff absence some hospitals are having to declare a critical incident,” he wrote. “Some hospitals are making urgent calls to exhausted staff to give up rest days and leave to enable them to sustain core services. Many more hospitals are having to ban visitors to try to reduce the spread of infection.” Taylor also urged politicians “making optimism and complacency a kind of political virility symbol” not to turn Covid policy “into a new terrain for the culture wars”, but instead to focus on the facts and “listen to those trying to cope on the frontline”. Meanwhile, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has written to ministers calling for further measures in England amid “confusing and concerning” differences in restrictions across the UK. “Nursing professionals are questioning the level and nature of the variation between governments,” wrote the RCN’s council chair, Carol Popplestone, and its general secretary and chief executive, Pat Cullen. “We therefore ask that, as secretary of state for health and social care, you work with counterparts across government on a more cautious approach for England without further delay.” Parliament will return from its Christmas recess on Wednesday, when the cabinet is set to meet to review the plan B rules. Ministers are expected to keep restrictions – including mask wearing, Covid passports and home working – as they are. On Monday, Johnson rejected the idea that England’s relatively limited Covid restrictions amounted to a gamble. “The way forward for the country as a whole is to continue with the path that we’re on,” he said. “We’ll keep everything under review. But the mixture of things that we’re doing at the moment is, I think, the right one.”";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/03/several-nhs-trusts-declare-critical-incidents-amid-covid-staff-crisis
5760;5760;Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre’s legal deal with Jeffrey Epstein released;2022-01-03T19:28:47Z;['Victoria Bekiempis'];['Jeffrey Epstein', 'Prince Andrew', 'UK news', 'US news', 'World news'];"Court papers unsealed on Monday revealed that Virginia Giuffre received $500,000 in a legal settlement with Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender whom she accused of sexual abuse. The unsealing stemmed from Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against Prince Andrew, which she filed on 9 August in Manhattan federal court.
Giuffre has long accused Epstein and his sometime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell – now a convicted sex trafficker, after her New York trial – of forcing her into sex with the royal when she was 17. He vehemently maintains his innocence. Andrew filed Giuffre’s settlement with Epstein as part of his attempt to dismiss her case, arguing that it shields him. Lawyers for the prince contend the settlement contains provisions that bar Giuffre from taking legal action against many Epstein associates. The unsealed settlement states that upon receipt of the stipulated sum, Giuffre, referred to under her maiden name, agrees to “remise, release, acquit, satisfy and forever discharge the said second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant … from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia Roberts, including state or federal, cause and causes of action”. Andrew is not mentioned. Nor is the lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who Giuffre has accused of sexual misconduct facilitated by Epstein, which he has repeatedly denied. In a court filing on 29 October, Andrew’s attorneys said: “Giuffre settled her sex-trafficking and sexual-abuse claims against Epstein in 2009. In doing so, she provided Epstein with a general release of all claims against him and numerous other individuals and entities. “To avoid being dragged into future legal disputes, Epstein negotiated for this broad release, insisting that it cover any and all persons who Giuffre identified as potential targets of future lawsuits, regardless of the merit – or lack thereof – to any such claims.” The attorneys also said: “Because Prince Andrew is a senior member of the British royal family, he falls into one of the expressly identified categories of persons, ie, royalty, released from liability under the release agreement, along with politicians, academicians, businessmen and others allegedly associated with Epstein. “As a third-party beneficiary of the release agreement, Prince Andrew is entitled to enforce the general release contained therein.” Lawyers for Andrew will argue for dismissal on Tuesday. Giuffre’s settlement is discussed extensively in their motion to dismiss. Attorneys for Andrew did not comment on Monday. A representative for Giuffre’s lawyers said the release was “irrelevant to Ms Giuffre’s claim against Prince Andrew” as it “does not mention Prince Andrew”. “He did not even know about it. He could not have been a ‘potential defendant’ in the settled case against Jeffrey Epstein both because he was not subject to jurisdiction in Florida and because the Florida case involved federal claims to which he was not a part. The actual parties to the release have made clear that Prince Andrew was not covered by it. “Lastly, the reason we sought to have the release made public was to refute the claims being made about it by Prince Andrew’s PR campaign.” The settlement with Epstein has also come up in Giuffre’s lawsuit against Dershowitz. On 16 April 2019, she filed a defamation suit over his denials of sexual misconduct. Dershowitz filed the Epstein settlement agreement in his fight against that suit. “Professor Dershowitz, as a third-party beneficiary of the 2009 settlement agreement, was entitled to rely upon and enforce the terms of that secret deal,” lawyers for Andrew said. On Monday, Dershowitz told the Guardian the settlement prevented Giuffre from legal action against him. “I’m delighted that this document was unsealed,” he said. “I want all documents, all photographs, all videotapes, I want everything unsealed so the whole truth comes out. “This document demonstrates that, in exchange for $500,000 … she agreed that she would not sue any of the following people, and they included anybody who she had accused or could accuse, including [academics] and royalty.” On 14 December, judges in the Prince Andrew and Dershowitz cases said: “Mr Epstein, as is well known, is deceased. The document is well known to Ms Giuffre and, although under seal, has been available to all parties in these cases for some time. “We question whether any proper purpose would be served by the continued secrecy of the document save, perhaps, the dollar amount of the settlement it provided for.” On 29 December, judges ordered the unsealing, saying nobody – including representatives of Epstein’s estate – had made an adequate showing otherwise. Lawyers for Giuffre have requested documents as part of her litigation, such as proof of Prince Andrew’s claim that he cannot sweat.
Giuffre has claimed the duke was “sweating profusely all over me” at a London discotheque on a night when she alleges they had sex. Andrew told the BBC the allegation could not be true, “because I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time”. The prince also maintained that on the day cited by Giuffre he took his daughter Beatrice to a late-afternoon children’s party at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking, Surrey. After that, he said, he was home with his children all night. Prince Andrew’s profile has been damaged considerably by his association with Maxwell and Epstein. On 29 December, a federal jury in Manhattan found Maxwell, the daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, guilty on five counts for luring girls as young as 14 into Epstein’s orbit for him to sexually abuse. Maxwell, 60, says she is innocent. Her lawyers have said they plan to appeal. Epstein, who also counted former presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton among his associates, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking teen girls. He killed himself about a month after his arrest in a New York jail, while awaiting trial.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/jeffrey-epstein-prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre

Shiffrin had a negative test on Monday afternoon before the American’s name appeared on the official start list for the race released by the International Ski Federation. “See you tomorrow, Zagreb,” Shiffrin wrote on Instagram. Shiffrin, who has won the event four times since 2013, will wear bib No 7. The first run starts at 12.30pm local time; the second run at 4.05pm, and this course will be set by Shiffrin’s coach, Mike Day. However, Shiffrin’s American teammate, Nina O’Brien, is among a group of racers missing Tuesday’s race as the coronavirus is increasingly affecting the women’s circuit, less than five weeks before the Beijing Olympics. The group sidelined for Tuesday’s race also includes at least three Swiss skiers – Camille Rast, Aline Danioth and Mélanie Meillard – as well as two Austrians, a Norwegian, and an Italian. One of the Austrians, Franziska Gritsch, said in November it was her “personal decision” not to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. She was not allowed to travel to the 27-28 November tech races in Killington, Vermont, for that reason. Shiffrin missed a giant slalom and a slalom in Lienz last week but remained in the lead of the overall World Cup standings, 93 points ahead of Sofia Goggia. The Italian speed specialist, who has not competed in slalom for five years, is absent in Croatia. Petra Vlhova, who is Shiffrin’s main rival in slalom, won the race in Austria last week and increased her lead over the American in the discipline standings to 120 points after four of nine races. Vlhova, who will open the slalom on Tuesday, has won the floodlit race in Zagreb for the past two years. No spectators will be allowed at the race on the outskirts of the Croatian capital, which usually is among the best-visited races on the women’s calendar.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/mikaela-shiffrin-return-world-cup-zagreb

5763;5763;When will Omicron peak in the UK and is the modelling wrong?;2022-01-03T18:54:04Z;['Linda Geddes'];['Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus', 'Science', 'UK news'];"The family gatherings have disbanded, the new year’s hangovers have lifted. Despite record Covid infection figures over the holiday period, evidence that the rate of increase in cases may be slowing has prompted speculation that London, at least, may be close to reaching “peak Omicron”. Boris Johnson is said to be obsessed with this hypothetical time point, seeing it as crucial to how the Covid variant may play out nationwide. If hospitalisations follow the same trajectory and peak without the NHS being overwhelmed, the prime minister’s decision not to impose lockdown-style restrictions before the holiday period may be vindicated. Johnson is correct that peak Omicron, when it comes, will be an important moment. “The reason it matters when it peaks – and particularly when cases peak in the over-50s – is it’s likely that a week later we’ll see the peak in hospitalisations, and roughly two weeks later, we’ll see a peak in the number of deaths. It’s helpful, because it helps us to plan ahead,” said Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate at the University of Cambridge’s MRC epidemiology unit.
In London, cases appear to have stabilised, or even fallen during the past two weeks. New hospitalisations also appear to have stabilised in recent days, with 319 people admitted with Covid-19 on 31 December, compared with 450 the day before, and 511 the day before that. “We would guess, based on what case numbers are doing in London, that the peak in hospital admissions should be this week, and nationally, maybe a week later,” Ali said. This is roughly in line with the scenarios outlined in modelling studies, which suggest Omicron cases will peak in early-mid January. However, the magnitude of the peak appears to be significantly lower than some of the worst case scenarios predicted. For instance, according to modelling data published by the University of Warwick on 30 December, hospital admissions should by now be approaching about 5,000 a day in England. Yet, according to the latest figures, the number of Covid-19 patients admitted on 1 January was 1,819, down from 2,370 three days earlier.
This does not necessarily mean we should disregard such models, as some hawkish MPs have suggested. Ali said: “Modelling, post-vaccination has become extremely difficult. And trying to predict people’s behaviour, well, they don’t even try to include that in the models, so, inevitably, they’re not going to be able to predict what’s going to happen. “Instead, they give a variety of scenarios, which are necessary because we have to have some idea of the range of possibilities. But when the range is so wide, it doesn’t really help policymakers, because the difference between 100 deaths a day and 6,000 deaths a day is just so huge.” Although the gloomiest predictions may have not come to pass, experts caution that we are not out of the woods yet. Some of the slowing could be a reflection of altered behaviour in the run-up to Christmas, when concern about escalating Omicron cases and a desire to spend the festive period with older relatives prompted many to scale back social activities and behave more cautiously. They may also have been less likely to get tested in the run-up to Christmas – assuming they could access a test. Now Christmas is over, some of us may have relaxed our behaviour. Whether we will see a surge in cases as a result of new year’s celebrations will not become apparent for about another week, as it takes five to six days on average after exposure to the virus for symptoms to develop, and then a further couple of days for people to seek a test and receive the results.
The return of children to schools this week – many of whom remain unvaccinated – may also lead to a surge in cases owing to increased mixing. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “The Warwick model suggested that cases would peak early January. But it is still impossible to say. We will probably only really know in retrospect a couple of weeks later. “What we can say is that the rate of increase has slowed dramatically for early mid-December, otherwise we would be seeing several millions of infections a day by now and that would have been impossible.” “Taking all this together, I don’t think we have peaked yet, but I think we are not that far away – or at least I hope so,” he added. A further fly in the ointment is that younger age groups accounted for the majority of Omicron cases during early-mid December, but increased intergenerational mixing over Christmas could yet trigger a surge of infections in older adults. Also, because Omicron is better at infecting people who have been vaccinated than Delta, proportionately more vulnerable older people are likely to fall ill.
The good news is that most of these people have now received a booster dose, and their levels of immune protection should remain high for a few months yet – though we will not yet know whether they will require yet another dose. The ramped-up booster programme has been under way for several weeks, meaning many younger individuals should also soon have additional layer of immune protection, if not already. The combination of this vaccine-induced protection and so many people having been infected means we will eventually we will hit peak Omicron, after which cases should begin to fall. This will be cause for celebration, but for as long as significant numbers of people around the world remain unvaccinated, the global death toll from Covid will continue to rise, and the chances of further variants emerging will remain. So, although the battle with Omicron may be beginning to turn in the UK’s favour, the wider war against coronavirus continues.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/when-will-omicron-peak-in-uk-and-is-the-modelling-wrong
5764;5764;Bins ‘overflowing’ in parts of England as Covid hits collections;2022-01-03T18:39:05Z;['Miranda Bryant'];['Coronavirus', 'Local government', 'England', 'UK news'];"Bins across parts of England are reportedly “overflowing” with rubbish from the festive period due to Covid-related staff shortages. London, Manchester, Somerset and Buckinghamshire are among the areas where councillors have warned that bin collections are being scaled back because of staff sickness.
In Enfield, Conservative councillor Stephanos Ioannou said: “I’ve been driving round my ward and seeing bins overflowing and Christmas trees are left outside.” He said he had received double the number of complaints about missed collections that he would usually receive at this time of year. “Over the Christmas period, usually I get on average 30 emails a week on waste services. I checked my inbox yesterday … and had about 50 or 60.” Chelmsford city council said 23 members of staff were absent and that three days of food waste collections were cancelled. North Somerset council, meanwhile, said it was unable to collect 1,000 recycling bins on New Year’s Eve because crews remained “stretched due to staff sickness”.
Several London boroughs have announced there may be delays in their services in the future. Haringey council warned that “uniquely challenging times” had affected its workforce and Newham council has temporarily suspended bulky waste collection as a result of “higher than normal levels of staff absence”. In Manchester, green food and garden recycling bin collections have been halted until further notice because of staff isolating. Residents have been told to put food waste into general waste bins and to keep hold of garden waste until collections start up again.
In Birmingham, the city council apologised for missed collections over the festive period, blaming crews being affected by Covid. Earlier, ministers had requested that public sector leaders set up contingency plans for worst-case scenarios of up to a quarter of staff being off work. Asked whether such shortages were likely, health minister Edward Argar told Times Radio: “We model a range of scenarios up to things we think are highly unlikely, but you still do it because that’s what a responsible government does in preparing for all eventualities.” A spokesperson for Enfield council said: “Despite very challenging circumstances, Enfield council continued to deliver an uninterrupted bin collection service throughout the festive period. Staff elected to work tirelessly, even on bank holidays, so that no residents had a change to their bin collection days. “However, staff shortages related to Covid-19 remain a concern for all local authorities, across several services. Enfield council has reviewed its business continuity plans and is ready to redeploy staff to keep priority services operating as close to normal as possible.” Meanwhile, the Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils across England, said crews have been strongly affected by the rise of Omicron and warned the problem “may get worse”. An LGA spokesperson said: “As cases of Covid-19 rise in light of the Omicron variant, councils are concerned that these existing staffing issues may get worse.” They also called for workers to be prioritised for Covid tests. • This article was amended on 7 January 2022 to remove references to bin collections in Gloucester as having been scaled back, and to add a statement from Enfield council that was received after publication.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/bins-overflowing-in-parts-of-england-as-covid-hits-collections
5765;5765;New York attorney general subpoenas Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump – report;2022-01-03T18:31:48Z;['N/A'];['Donald Trump', 'Donald Trump Jr', 'Ivanka Trump', 'US news', 'New York', 'World news'];"The attorney general of New York state has subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump as part of its fraud inquiry into Trump’s businesses, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing a court document.
The document was filed by lawyers for Trump in response to Letitia James’s decision to subpoena the former president himself. Trump alleges that James’s investigation is politically motivated. The Times said the subpoenas for Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr “were served on 1 December, according to a person with knowledge of the matter”. The paper also noted that Eric Trump, another of Trump’s adult children, was questioned in the case in October 2020. James’ office went to court to enforce a subpoena on the younger Trump brother and a judge forced him to testify after his lawyers abruptly canceled a scheduled deposition. James’s civil investigation is focused on tax affairs at the Trump Organization, specifically whether assets were inflated or understated to influence tax valuations. In one such alleged instance, in 2016, the Guardian reported on differing valuations of a golf club outside New York City. The headline: How Trump’s $50m golf club became $1.4m when it came time to pay tax. Trump denies wrongdoing. The former president’s business and tax affairs are also the subject of a criminal investigation in Manhattan, in progress for more than three years and joined by James last May. Last year, the then Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr, gained access to Donald Trump’s tax records after a multiyear fight that twice went to the US supreme court. Before he left office at the end of last year, Vance convened a new grand jury to hear evidence as he weighed whether to seek more indictments in the investigation, which resulted in tax fraud charges in July against the Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. Weisselberg pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he and the company evaded taxes on lucrative fringe benefits paid to executives. Both investigations are at least partly related to allegations made in news reports and by Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer, that Trump had a history of misrepresenting the value of assets. James’ office issued subpoenas to local governments for records pertaining to Trump’s estate north of Manhattan, Seven Springs, and a tax benefit Trump received for placing land into a conservation trust. Vance issued subpoenas seeking many of the same records. James’ office has also been looking at similar issues relating to a Trump office building in New York, a hotel in Chicago and a golf course near Los Angeles. Her office won a series of court rulings forcing Trump’s company and a law firm to turn over records. James and the Trump Organization did not immediately comment on the subpoenas for Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/donald-trump-jr-ivanka-trump-new-york-attorney-general
5766;5766;Democrats bid to change Senate rules if Republicans thwart voting rights reform;2022-01-03T18:30:34Z;['David Smith'];['Democrats', 'Republicans', 'US news', 'US voting rights', 'World news', 'US Senate', 'US Congress', 'US politics'];"Democrats are seizing on this week’s anniversary of the deadly US Capitol riot to renew a push for voting rights legislation to safeguard democracy.
Majority leader Chuck Schumer announced on Monday that the Senate will vote on changing its own rules on or before 17 January, the federal Martin Luther King Jr Day holiday, if Republicans continue to obstruct election reform. The deadline appears part of a concerted effort to use Thursday’s commemorations, marking a year since a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, seeking to overturn Joe Biden’s election win, to give fresh impetus to the long-stalled legislation. In a letter to Senate Democrats, Schumer argued that the events of 6 January 2021 are directly linked to a campaign by Republican state legislatures to impose voter restriction laws. “Let me be clear,” the New York senator wrote. “6 January was a symptom of a broader illness – an effort to delegitimise our election process, and the Senate must advance systemic democracy reforms to repair our republic or else the events of that day will not be an aberration – they will be the new norm. “Much like the violent insurrectionists who stormed the US Capitol nearly one year ago, Republican officials in states across the country have seized on the former president’s Big Lie about widespread voter fraud to enact anti-democratic legislation and seize control of typically non-partisan election administration functions.” Sweeping voting rights reforms have stalled in the evenly split 50-50 Senate, repeatedly blocked by a Republican-led filibuster, leaving Democrats unable to find the 60 votes needed to advance. Schumer went further than before in calling for a filibuster exception for voting rights. “We must ask ourselves: if the right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, then how can we in good conscience allow for a situation in which the Republican party can debate and pass voter suppression laws at the state level with only a simple majority vote, but not allow the United States Senate to do the same? We must adapt. The Senate must evolve, like it has many times before.” He added: “We hope our Republican colleagues change course and work with us. But if they do not, the Senate will debate and consider changes to Senate rules on or before 17 January, Martin Luther King Jr Day, to protect the foundation of our democracy: free and fair elections.” Although Schumer’s words were ostensibly aimed at Republicans, there is little prospect of any members of that party shifting their position. On Monday, Republicans swiftly condemned what they described as a threat. Senator Mike Lee of Utah said: “Senator Schumer’s rash, partisan power grab should be seen for what it is – desperation and a failure to do what Joe Biden and Democrats ran on: unify. “If this rule change were to pass, the people of Utah and the United States would suffer immeasurably as the Senate devolves into a strictly majoritarian, Lord-of-the-Flies environment. Senator Schumer and his disastrous plan must be stopped.” But Schumer’s true target, amid blanket media coverage of this week’s anniversary, is likely to be Democratic holdouts Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who have resisted abolishing or changing the filibuster. The senators from West Virginia and Arizona contend that if and when Republicans take control of the chamber, they could use the lower voting threshold to advance bills Democrats oppose. Schumer’s announcement is likely to set up 6 January vigils and Martin Luther King Jr Day events as rallying points for voting rights activists who have criticised Biden and the party in Congress for failing to prioritise the issue. But the president has become less cautious and more direct. Last month, he told ABC News: “If the only thing standing between getting voting rights legislation passed and not getting passed is the filibuster, I support making the exception of voting rights for the filibuster.” Schumer’s announcement was welcomed by Martin Luther King III, son of the civil rights activist and chairman of the Drum Major Institute. “There is no better way to honor my father’s legacy than protecting the right to vote for all Americans,” he said.
“The King holiday is historically a day of service, and we hope the United States Senate will serve our democracy by passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. “We applaud Senator Schumer for his commitment to expanding voting rights, but we won’t halt our plans for action until legislation has been signed.” Also on Monday, the US Conference of Mayors sent a letter signed by 146 bipartisan mayors to Schumer and the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, urging them to act this month. It noted that in the past few months alone, 19 states passed 34 laws that made it harder to vote. The mayors wrote: “American democracy is stronger when all eligible voters participate in elections. Yet voting rights are under historic attack and our very democracy is threatened. “These bills would stop this voter suppression. They would create national standards for voting access in federal elections that would neutralize many of the restrictive voting laws passed in the states.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/schumer-senate-democracy-voting-rights-election
5767;5767;The Guardian view on Britain and France: the very worst of rivals | Editorial;2022-01-03T18:30:07Z;['Editorial'];['Brexit', 'Foreign policy', 'European Union', 'Boris Johnson', 'Liz Truss', 'Politics', 'Europe', 'UK news', 'David Frost', 'France', 'International trade', 'Conservatives', 'Business', 'Economics'];At the core of Boris Johnson’s Brexit is a conflict between ideology and geography. The purpose of the project is divergence – a competitive leap away from Europe into other markets. But that impulse to move is thwarted by the permanence of Britain’s location. No matter how much sovereignty the Eurosceptics claim over national regulation, governing a medium-sized power 30 miles from the coast of France will always require some accommodation with the interests of neighbouring states. EU membership was not the only possible way to manage those relationships, but it worked better than anything that had been tried in the preceding centuries, and nothing has been arranged to replace it. The Brexit withdrawal deal offers only a technical framework for economic partnership, and even that is unstable, as is clear from the ongoing negotiations over customs checks for Northern Ireland and operating licences for French fishers in UK waters. The two issues are not equivalent in scale. Much more is at stake on the island of Ireland, given the history of sectarian violence. But they flow from a common Brexit delusion, which is the belief that “taking back control” is a unilateral assertion. In reality, borders have two sides. The folly of ignoring that strategic geometry has been routinely demonstrated, most recently in a silly exchange of recriminations over migrant boat crossings in the Channel. The Home Office, being unable to stop the vessels, has tried blaming French authorities for failing to stop embarkations. France replies that the draw factor is lax British labour regulations that act as a magnet for refugees seeking a new life. French agenda Tensions on that front predate Brexit. The UK was not part of the Schengen common travel area, and policing of the Anglo-French border is governed by the bilateral Le Touquet accord. But the capacity for escalation is higher now that Britain has no seat around the EU table where other continental leaders meet. As it happens, France sets the agenda at that table for the first six months of 2022, as holder of the rotating council presidency. That means also that President Emmanuel Macron’s hawkish view of Britain’s obligations to uphold the Brexit agreement it signed will set the tone in Brussels. Since Mr Macron is seeking re-election in April, his attention will be more than usually focused on domestic matters. To the extent that those issues overlap with Brexit – as in the fisheries dispute – there will be pressure to take a hard line with London. There is a tendency in Downing Street to see Mr Macron’s stance as punitive to the point of spite. The Tory Eurosceptic view is that France, affronted by the temerity of Britannia in choosing freedom, is determined to prevent her from enjoying its benefits. That analysis contains a truth, filtered through a jaundiced lens. Mr Macron, in common with other EU leaders, understands that Brexit is a deliberate strategic challenge to the European project, based on the false premise that Britain could retain benefits of proximity to continental markets while using deregulation to outcompete EU businesses. Plainly, it is in the economic interests of member states for that not to happen. It is also in the interest of politicians who are committed to the logic of supranational solidarity that Euroscepticism be seen as a strategic cul-de-sac. Mr Macron is less patient than some of his continental counterparts for that point to be proven. As German chancellor, Angela Merkel took the view that British noses should not be rubbed too hard in the folly of Brexit, lest they be put out of joint. She feared Britain sliding even deeper into populism. Her successor, Olaf Scholz, is closer to Mr Macron’s position. Anglo-French relations are not helped by the low opinion that the French president has of Boris Johnson. He has been quoted describing the prime minister as “un clown”. He believes Mr Johnson is a deceitful and unreliable partner. A run of poor judgments and conspicuous dishonesties have made that assessment of Mr Johnson’s character indisputable. It is a settled view among many voters and formerly loyal Tory MPs that he is a liar. Provoking Brussels The resignation of David Frost, Johnson’s Brexit negotiator, compounded the domestic crisis engulfing No 10, but will not change the underlying dynamics in relations with the rest of Europe. Lord Frost was a zealot in pursuit of pure sovereignty and, in quitting, he signalled displeasure at compromises imposed from Downing Street. But the prime minister’s room to compromise is limited when so many of his MPs have lost faith in his judgment, already feel betrayed and are winding themselves towards a regicidal frenzy. That is also a consideration for Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, who inherits Lord Frost’s portfolio. She was a remainer in 2016, but her ambition to succeed Mr Johnson is a more salient factor for 2022. She, too, will be wary of alienating the hardliners. The incumbent prime minister’s insecurity might give him cause to prefer provocation in Brussels, on the ancient but shabby premise that foreign quarrels can galvanise domestic audiences. The threat of using Article 16 – the emergency brake in the Brexit deal – has receded while the government deals with another pandemic wave, but a prime minister with few other options keeps his finger on the trigger. Alternatively, he might calculate that a trade war with Brussels would be too expensive and compound the impression of a slide into chaos when what people crave most is a period of sustained, stable and grown-up government. In neither scenario is it likely that the prime minister will be thinking beyond short-term survival or acting with a strategic concept for Britain’s evolving relations with its neighbours. If there was ever such a capacity in Mr Johnson’s regime, it has been swept away in a cascade of crises. When the only purpose left for the prime minister is getting from one day to the next, there is no room for coherent foreign policy. And, since incoherence with regard to Europe is intrinsic to Brexit, there is no imminent prospect of restored stability in relations with Britain’s nearest neighbours. For that to happen, there has to be a resolution in the conflict between geography and ideology. Only one side can win, of course. The facts of Britain’s place in the world beat the fantasies of escaping it. Mr Johnson and his party might continue to postpone their own comprehension of that defeat. They cannot ultimately avoid it.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/03/the-guardian-view-on-britain-and-france-the-very-worst-of-rivals
5768;5768;Romelu Lukaku to return to Chelsea squad after talks with Tuchel;2022-01-03T18:20:00Z;['Jacob Steinberg'];['Chelsea', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Romelu Lukaku is in line to return to Chelsea’s squad after holding productive talks with Thomas Tuchel over the striker’s controversial interview. Tuchel is expected to restore Lukaku to his side when Chelsea host Tottenham in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday after the £97.5m forward expressed regret over going public with his unhappiness about life at Stamford Bridge.
The Belgian was left out entirely against Liverpool on Sunday, but he trained with the first team before holding talks with his manager on Monday and there is a desire on all sides to move on from the episode. It is understood that Marina Granovskaia, the powerful Chelsea director, was involved in helping Lukaku and Tuchel clear the air. Tuchel had the backing of the club’s hierarchy and his squad when he decided to drop Chelsea’s record signing against Liverpool. Sources close to Lukaku hope that he offers a public apology over his comments. Chelsea fans were left fuming after Lukaku questioned Tuchel’s system and said that he hopes to return to Internazionale one day in an unauthorised interview with Sky Italia last week. The 28-year-old has no intention of leaving Stamford Bridge, but Tuchel was unimpressed with his actions. Tuchel said that he did not feel personally attacked, but the German is believed to be unhappy that Lukaku allowed doubts over his commitment to Chelsea to bubble up before a huge game against Liverpool. The Tottenham manager, Antonio Conte, said he hoped Lukaku, with whom he won Serie A at Internazionale last season, would play. “I think it’s always a good thing to play against a team that has all the players are available,” he said. “For the people that watch the game, I think it’s good to see the best players on the pitch.” Meanwhile, Thiago Silva has eased Chelsea’s defensive concerns after signing a one-year contract extension.
Thomas Tuchel is facing the prospect of having to reshape his defence in the summer, with César Azpilicueta, Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rüdiger out of contract. Chelsea are yet to agree extensions with the trio but there has never been any prospect of Silva leaving the club on a free. Tuchel values Silva’s leadership and will be happy to have the 37‑year‑old for another season. The Brazil centre-back, who has impressed since joining on a free from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2020, helped Chelsea to win the Champions League last season and hopes to go to the World Cup this year. “To play here with Chelsea is a real pleasure,” Silva told the club’s website. “I never thought I would play for three years here in this great club so I’m very happy to stay for another season. I will continue to give everything for this club and for the supporters, who have always been by my side since I arrived. “It’s amazing to have this relationship with the fans and not only that but the players, staff and the whole club. I’m going to give everything to keep playing at this level in the most important league in the world.” Chelsea are aware that Azpilicueta, Christensen and Rüdiger can negotiate pre-contract agreements with foreign clubs now. Real Madrid are leading the race to sign Rüdiger, who is not satisfied with Chelsea’s offer of £140,000 a week. The Germany centre-back is also of interest to Bayern Munich, Juventus and PSG.
Tuchel recently revealed frustration at the uncertainty over Christensen, who has twice changed his mind after agreeing new deals. Barcelona are interested in Azpilicueta but it is understood that the captain will stay if given a suitable offer. Chelsea have mounting injury problems before the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Tottenham on Wednesday. The defender Trevoh Chalobah went off with a hamstring injury in the 2-2 draw with Liverpool on Sunday and is awaiting the results of a scan.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/thiago-silva-signs-new-contract-chelsea
5769;5769;Ofsted inspectors could ease the school staffing crisis | Letters;2022-01-03T18:11:55Z;['N/A'];['Teaching', 'Education', 'Ofsted', 'Schools', 'Coronavirus', 'Nadhim Zahawi', 'Politics'];"In its response to the staffing crisis in schools (Combine classes in case of Covid staff shortages, DfE tells teachers in England, 2 January), there’s one resource that the government has yet to tap into – the inspectorate. If Ofsted is not going to inspect “secondary schools or colleges in the first week of term”, why not deploy the inspectors to teach in them, and why not for as long as the health crisis affects staffing levels? Instead of telling teachers that their provision is “inadequate” or “requiring improvement”, the inspectors could lead by example and show staff how “outstanding” teaching can be done. There are clearly not enough inspectors to fill all the vacancies that will be caused by the pandemic, but Ofsted has around 1,800 employees across eight regions, most of whom could be redeployed to where the need is greatest, in those schools and colleges serving the most deprived communities. This policy would cost nothing, it would be hugely beneficial to those institutions and pupils in improving the quality of their education, and it would also act as a useful means of updating inspectors about the challenges of working in them. Politicians are forever claiming that they don’t have a magic wand to solve complex problems, but this measure is the closest they are likely to get to a partial solution that could be enacted immediately. What’s not to like? Frank Coffield Emeritus professor of education, UCL Institute of Education • Nadhim Zahawi has told schools to “utilise all your available teaching and non-teaching workforce to maximise on-site education for as many pupils as possible”. It would seem that schools are being seen by the Department for Education as simply holding places to keep children off the streets and away from homes so that their parents can go to work. Few state schools have classrooms large enough to “merge classes”, but since five of the current six ministers in the DfE went to independent schools, they may not realise this. “For a classroom to qualify for a government air purifier, the DfE says it must show a ‘sustained’ CO2 reading of 1,500 particles per million or higher for a week when occupied,” your report says. So, while teaching a merged class, a non-teacher needs to count air particles. Help! Michael Bassey Emeritus professor of education, Nottingham Trent University • If Robert Halfon is really concerned about children’s “wellbeing, mental health and anxiety”, he will get behind evidenced-based measures, such as mask-wearing, to help keep them in schools. Disruption caused by illness, school closures and a succession of unfamiliar teachers is bound to be extremely damaging to young people. To date there has been no serious government effort in the UK to improve ventilation in schools. However, the evidence is incontrovertible: masks help to cut transmission. Many students will be relieved to be in classrooms where others are wearing masks, especially those in clinically vulnerable families who carry the burden of knowing they could bring home a virus that could kill. None of this is ideal; pandemics aren’t. As adults we have to stop undermining measures that will help protect students and staff and keep schools open.

5770;5770;Landowners need help to let walkers roam | Letters;2022-01-03T18:11:03Z;['N/A'];['Walking', 'Fitness', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Hobbies', 'Life and style', 'Scotland', 'UK news'];I am a landowner with 9,000 acres. I am probably in the minority of landowners because I encourage walkers on my land. There are, however, additional barriers to access aside from the “prejudice, traffic, locked gates, signs with the dread words ‘private – keep out’” mentioned by John Harris (Walking is a glorious, primal pastime – and far more radical than you think, 26 December). There is the planning department of our national parks to consider. I was recently encouraged to apply for a grant to create additional footpaths on my land. Indications were that some grant would be forthcoming, and I was told that the next step would be to apply for planning permission, which I did. Several months later I got a reply from the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park indicating that permission was highly unlikely to be granted. I was staggered by this. The right hand clearly does not know what the left hand is doing. The desire to improve access to my land is entirely altruistic. I do not charge for entry on to the land, my business is not dependent on access to the hill, and I have no tea shop or other commercial outlet dependent on passing traffic. I genuinely believe that more people should get out and walk for the benefit of their health and life. If your newspaper would like to support a campaign to change the planning policy guidelines in this regard I would be delighted. Pelham Olive London • One wintry day in the 1970s, I took my two small children out, intending to walk in the grounds of a nearby stately home. But the tall gates were locked, with a “private – keep out” sign. We climbed over them and started our walk. As we came in sight of the house, a window opened and a voice said: “I say, do you know this is private property?” “Oh, yes,” I replied, “we saw your notice when we climbed over the gates.” “Well, don’t come too near the house,” the voice said, closing the window. We had a lovely walk. Morag Stuart London • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5771;5771;Ghislaine Maxwell and the complex family roots of cruelty and abuse | Letter;2022-01-03T18:09:56Z;['N/A'];['Ghislaine Maxwell', 'Children', 'Psychiatry', 'Society', 'US news', 'World news'];Jonathan Freedland is right to say we fight shy of the “why” question when faced with extreme acts of cruelty or abuse (The Ghislaine Maxwell case raises a question some may think naive: why? 31 December). But he pulls up short. We do know a lot about the explanations. There is a small group of clinicians who work with such people in prisons and special hospitals, and their findings can be simply summarised. Every one of them has their own history of childhood emotional brutality at the hands of parents or carers. What they take into themselves is this relationship. Some re-enact this in later life, expelling their experiences on to others. Others keep it internalised, then inflict injury and cruelty on themselves. Fortunately, many will have ameliorative experiences that protect others and themselves from the worst consequences. True, not everyone has a “Maxwell-style father”, but delve into the backstory of any cruelly troubled individual and you discover an intergenerational history. No one is born inherently evil, or good. It’s about innate dispositions and their nurturing over time. Between the initial conditions and the later destructive behaviours there will be twists and turns of complex causality. It’s these we need to understand better to avoid resort to theology or just throwing up our hands in despair.

5773;5773;England head to ‘special’ SCG Test in search of Ashes inspiration | Ali Martin;2022-01-03T18:00:06Z;['Ali Martin'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'Australia cricket team', 'England cricket team', 'The Ashes', 'Cricket', 'Australia sport', 'Sport'];"The Sydney Football Stadium in Moore Park serves a decent reminder Australia is a country that rarely stands still. Originally built in 1988, what appeared to be a serviceable venue has been bulldozed since the last Ashes tour four years ago and in its place an eye-catching new AU$828m replacement is approaching completion. Barely a stone’s throw from the latest sporting UFO to land on Australian soil sits the wonderful Sydney Cricket Ground, which despite being upgraded and swollen by way of capacity over the years still retains a sense of history. Its green-roofed 19th century ladies’ and members’ pavilions are untouched through their heritage listing. So, too, the old clock tower and an array of statues that denote past greats of the game. It remains a truly evocative place to watch Test cricket.
Inspiration has been in short supply for England’s cricketers since they arrived for this pandemic-era Ashes tour in November and their issues have been myriad en route to 68 all out and 3-0 down with two Tests to play. But as they step out onto the cambered baize outfield, Joe Root hopes his men take in the surroundings, think of the charity angle to proceedings, remember past English success stories and realise how fortunate they all are to be representing their country during admittedly tough times. “It’s obviously a special Test match,” said Root, before training on Monday. “You’ve got the McGrath Foundation [raising funds for breast cancer support] and you look at some of the performances on previous tours, like the 2010-11 team winning here, how special that was and how it will live long in the memory of fans and players. “It was here [Darren] Gough got his hat-trick in 1999, too. It’s a venue where a number of special things have happened for England players and it’s an opportunity to do just that. For me personally, I’d love more than anything to walk away with a win. Personal achievements make you proud and it means you are pulling your weight. But nothing compares to winning a Test match and I’m desperate to do that.” If there is a positive to be found beyond the red lines on various lateral flow tests during a disrupted buildup, it’s that the tourists appear to have just about held together off the field while disintegrating on it. There has been grumbling about the Covid lifestyle and Stuart Broad has gone public with his annoyance at missing out on green surfaces in Brisbane and Melbourne. But any serious angst is yet to bleed out of the dressing room while Australia have been tearing them up with barely a sledge to be heard. Perhaps this should be a concern; a sign that a team which has been forced to plough through 21 Test matches since the start of the pandemic, compared to seven for their hosts, has now entered a dazed fug of mere fixture fulfilment. Australia are on a heady roll, their series win one of contributions throughout the team, and will be hard to stop now. Either way, performances in this fourth Test, followed by a fifth still slated for Hobart, may provide an answer as to the state of various minds among Root’s troupe.
They may also serve to inform how much substance there is to all the private and public support for Root’s continuation as captain as he passes Alastair Cook’s record of 59 Tests in charge. The 31-year-old once again insisted it was a topic to be discussed at the end of the tour, but stressed his pride at being given the opportunity to lead “has not wavered from day one”, adding: “I’ll keep throwing everything I can into trying to give England the best chances of winning and give the best account of ourselves.” In the past week this has involved Root literally throwing everything he can at teammates in the nets due to the Covid-enforced absences of the head coach, Chris Silverwood, and three members of his staff. England’s opponents, though forced to bring in Usman Khawaja at No 5 after Travis Head tested positive for the virus, have had far fewer issues with which to contend, even if they have been ticked off for not drinking the official beer sponsor of Cricket Australia during the celebrations in Melbourne.
Two days out from the toss Root did not give much away selection-wise, although the peripheral roles of Rory Burns and Ollie Pope at training pointed to more 12th man-duties and an unchanged England top seven. Gone are the days of Sydney being the ground where spinners lick their lips, however, with Nathan Lyon, one of a number on the books of New South Wales, averaging 40 with the ball here in Test cricket. As such, and with some rain forecast over the coming days, recent talk of the Queensland leg-spinner Mitch Swepson coming in to join him as a pairing in preparation for the upcoming tour of Pakistan always felt optimistic.
Instead, beyond a return for the experienced Khawaja, and with little reason to press Josh Hazlewood into service too soon after the side strain picked up during the first Test, Australia’s final decision was whether to retain Scott Boland after his remarkable six for seven in Melbourne or return to the established pecking order by recalling Jhye Richardson. Boland got the nod on Tuesdaythis morning, instantly dashing local predictions of a one-cap wonder/future quiz question. England, meanwhile, were lining up a return for Broad in place of Ollie Robinson, who for all his obvious skill has looked heavy-legged at times. But ultimately the question will be whether their batting lineup can finally stand up to an attack that has been relentless from ball one of this uncompetitive series or find itself once again unsentimentally razed to the ground like the old football stadium next door.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/england-head-to-special-scg-test-in-search-of-ashes-inspiration
5774;5774;Italy: proposal for statue of first woman to get PhD sparks debate;2022-01-03T17:45:40Z;['Angela Giuffrida'];['Italy', 'Europe', 'World news', 'Women', 'Culture'];"A proposal to insert a statue of the first woman in the world to earn a PhD among the 78 dedicated to notable male figures on a prominent square in northern Italy has stirred controversy. Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia received her doctorate degree in philosophy from the University of Padua in 1678. But she was not included when Padua officials devised a project in the late 18th century to erect statues in Prato della Valle – the largest square in Italy – dedicated to illustrious historical figures who were either from the city or had links to it. Originally there were 88 statues adorning the central island of the 90,000-sq-metre square, all paying tribute to men, including the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei, the sculptor Antonio Canova, and several popes. But 10 statues dedicated to Venetian doges were destroyed by Napoleon’s army after it conquered the republic of Venice; eight were later replaced by obelisks, while two of the pedestals remained empty. Although a statue honouring Piscopia already exists at the University of Padua, two local councillors, Simone Pillitteri and Margherita Colonnello, proposed celebrating her with another on one of the empty pedestals at Prato della Valle. “Perhaps it is not so well known that the figures to whom the stone effigies are dedicated are all, without exception, men,” the pair wrote in a motion presented to the city’s council. The suggestion came after Mi Riconosci, an association of professionals working in the cultural heritage sector, undertook a census of all statues of Italian figures erected in public spaces across the country and found that only 148 were dedicated to women. Federica Arcoraci, an art historian with Mi Riconosci, said Prato della Valle’s male-only line-up had “an impact on our lives and collective imagination”. She said: “The Prato della Valle regulation of 1776 forbade having statues of saints, living people and people with no ties to the city, but never prohibited the representation of women. “Obviously, that was the result of a particular trend in history. But today it is possible to create a project that is connected with the history of the square in its entirety.”
Nevertheless, the proposal immediately sparked debate, with detractors arguing that placing a statue of Piscopia in the square would be “out of context” with its history. Carlo Fumian, a history professor at the University of Padua, said the “expensive and bizarre” idea was “a bit trendy, but culturally inconsistent”. “Moving monuments as if they were Lego is a dangerous and unintelligent game,” he told the local newspaper, Il Mattino di Padova. “Instead, we should help people discover the original [statue], triumphantly seated at the university.” Art historian Davide Tramarin said the two empty pedestals should remain empty as they represented a symbol of the historical destruction by Napoleon’s troops. Fabrizio Magani, the superintendent of Padua’s cultural heritage, is open to the idea, but suggested a female figure from more recent history ought to be celebrated in the square. “It’s shocking that even just the proposal to have a statue representing an important figure of the city has caused such a debate,” said Leonardo Bison, a Padua-based journalist. “But it’s surprising that Piscopia is not there when other less important male figures are.” • This article was amended on 4 January 2022. Prato della Valle covers about 90,000 sq metres, not 90 sq metres.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/italy-proposal-statue-elena-cornaro-piscopia-first-woman-phd-debate
5775;5775;European stocks reach record highs on first day of trading in 2022;2022-01-03T17:35:16Z;['Jillian Ambrose'];['Stock markets', 'Investing', 'Business', 'Europe', 'Shares', 'Investments', 'World news', 'Financial sector', 'Germany', 'France'];"European shares bounded to record highs in the first day of trading in 2022 as markets bet on a steady economic recovery despite the rising number of Covid-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant. Europe’s benchmark stock index, the Stoxx 600, rose to a record intraday high of 491.73 points on Monday, surpassing its November peak of 490.58, as global oil and equity markets climbed. It later closed at 489.99, up 0.45%. The Stoxx 600 recorded a 22.4% jump last year, its second-best yearly performance in over a decade, after the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and government stimulus spending encouraged investors to pour money back into the markets. The share price of airlines Lufthansa and Air France KLM were two of the biggest climbers across Europe’s equity markets after analysts at Citi forecast that the reopening of travel routes to Asia could help bolster the beleaguered travel sector. Lufthansa shares rose by almost 8.9% to €6.73 a share, and Air France KLM rose by 4.9% to €4.06. Europe’s record start to the new year set the stage for US markets to continue their late 2021 recovery. The opening of the S&P 500 index, which climbed by 26.9% last year, was bolstered by a 9% jump in Tesla shares after the company’s quarterly deliveries exceeded expectations. In another boost to US markets global oil prices, which last year recorded their biggest annual rise since at least 2016, resumed their rise towards $80 a barrel as fears that emerged late last year over the impact of the Omicron variant waned. The oil price helped shares in US oil majors Chevron and ExxonMobil climb by 1% each. The global surge in market optimism triggered a slump in the price of gold, which is considered a “safe haven” commodity during periods of equity market volatility. The spot price of gold was on track for its biggest one-day percentage decline in more than a month on Monday afternoon after the price dipped 1.6% to $1,798.97 an ounce. The London Stock Exchange (LSE), which has lagged behind its European and US rivals by climbing 14.3% last year, was closed on Monday for the New Year’s bank holiday. The FTSE 100 has been criticised as “old-fashioned” due to its dearth of tech companies and a glut of oil and bank stocks. It remained 6.5% below its May 2018 peak last year while the US, German and French markets all hit record highs. Sean Darby, a global equity strategist at Jefferies, said: “Although Covid-19 variants permeated the global economy, 2021 was the year of records with many bourses closing at or near record highs, while inflows into equities surpassed their largest accumulation ever. Peering into 2022, we expect volatility to rise.” Global oil markets are also expected to face ongoing volatility in the year ahead as traders balance the risk that the Omicron variant may stall a rebound in demand for transport fuels, against uncertain supplies from the world’s biggest oil producers. The oil price retreated at the end of 2021 following the discovery of the new variant, from just over $85 a barrel in October to narrowly below $70 a barrel a month ago. However, analysts believe that Brent crude could be on track to reach $90 a barrel in the year ahead as Covid-19 restrictions continue to fall away. Tamas Varga, from the oil broker PVM, said: “Infection rates are on the rise globally, restrictions are being introduced in several countries, the air travel sector, among others, is suffering, yet investors’ optimism is tangible.
“It seems that the current strain produces less severe symptoms than its predecessors, which might just help us to struggle through the fourth wave of the pandemic.” The rising oil price is likely to spell further financial hardship for hard-pressed households in the UK, which face record high petrol pump prices and further hikes to the cost of gas and electricity bills in the months ahead. British households and businesses can expect to be hit by the highest rate of inflation for a decade, owing to the rising cost of raw materials and ongoing disruption to global supply chains, after the consumer prices index measure of inflation surged to 5.1% in November. The Bank of England has said inflation could peak at about 6% in April – three times its target rate of 2% – as energy bills are expected to almost double from record levels this winter. • This article was amended on 4 January 2022. The S&P 500 index rose by 26.9% last year, not a record 47.7% as an earlier version said.

5776;5776;Getafe roll over Real Madrid in great escape bid inspired by Crystal Palace | Sid Lowe;2022-01-03T17:32:55Z;['Sid Lowe'];['Getafe', 'Real Madrid', 'La Liga', 'European club football', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Giovanni Trapattoni carried a bottle of holy water with him, blessed by the sister who actually was his sister. In 2009 the Espanyol manager Mauricio Pochettino hiked to Montserrat to visit the black virgin, enlisting her help in avoiding relegation, salvation delivered soon after. And Raúl Madero, the Argentinian national team doctor, twice visited the wailing wall. The first time, before the 1986 World Cup, he asked for them to be champions; when he went back four years later, he thought that would be pushing it, so requested runners-up. True story, and when it comes to football you’ll try anything. Sometimes it even works. Some turn to God, others turn their back on Him. Coco Basile tells of the priest he kicked out of the San Lorenzo dressing room. His name was Jorge, a fan who loved his team and prayed with them; he was also a jinx, Basile said. Fifteen years later, Jorge became Pope Francis. Meanwhile, up in A Coruña, Deportivo have been known to cast a pagan’s spell,: “Beelzebub’s fire, burning corpses and farts from infernal bottoms” thrown into a bubbling cauldron. Like many rituals, it doesn’t always work, but you’ve got to have something to turn to: some source of solace or inspiration, even if it’s not so much Papa Francisco as Pape Souaré, more Delaney than divine.
And so it was that Getafe turned to Crystal Palace. Which might sound a bit weird, but while there’s no sign of the Messiah they did have Fosu-Mensah, and Getafe were desperate. They were also pointless and you can insert your own joke here. “One point would give us life,” the striker Jaime Mata insisted, but their vital signs were fading fast, each defeat crueller and more inevitable than the last. Seven games in, they had lost all seven, already adrift at the bottom. “You get the feeling you’ve seen this film before,” Míchel González, their then-manager, had said, and it didn’t have a happy ending. “Anxiety is inevitable.” No one had ever started a top-flight season as badly, after all. No one in Spain, anyway. Not long ago there was a team in south London that were even worse and somehow they survived, rescued by Roy Hodgson. Seven weeks into the 2017-2018 season, Crystal Palace had lost all seven games. In the eighth, they defeated Chelsea and eventually finished 11th. Getafe made a motivational video, all dramatic music and headlines, drawing on Palace’s experience to declare: “When results don’t come … when you try but don’t succeed … history shows it’s still possible.” It was too. Andros Townsend moves in mysterious ways. That day, Getafe had no points and were bottom. On Sunday, they defeated Real Madrid 1-0 at the Coliseum, the afternoon spent singing in the sun, welcoming in the new year. “Liberation,” the goalscorer Enes Unal called it. This was their first win against Madrid in almost nine years, but it wasn’t a one-off or a fluke. Yes, they were gifted the goal, Éder Militão robbed by Unal – the perfect illustration of Carlo Ancelotti’s line about preferring “pessimistic” defenders who fear the worst – and sure, Ancelotti insisted the visitors “were still on holiday”. But that probably overplayed their passivity and this wasn’t only about Madrid, it was about Getafe too. Seemingly down then, they now have 18 points and are five places and 10 points off the bottom. Unbeaten in six, they’ve lost only one in nine. “The mental state is different now,” their coach said afterwards. “It’s interesting watching a team convert negative energy into positive, how horizons can change, how a group is transformed.”
Which is exactly what he came for. There was a moment earlier this season when the pitchside reporter helpfully pointed out that the fans were still chanting Míchel’s name, which indeed they were; it was just a pity it was followed by the words go and now. When now arrived and Míchel was sacked in October, Getafe had actually just got their first point with a 1-1 draw against Real Sociedad but he was replaced by Quique Sánchez Flores, returning for his third spell 16 years after the first. Forty years old when he led Getafe’s debut in primera, at 56 his mission now was to keep them there. He couldn’t turn them down: “Getafe is a family, and the family has problems,” he said. Under Míchel, Getafe earned one point from 24. Under Quique, they earned 17 of 33. A table of his time there has them fifth in La Liga. Those stats probably make it sound more clear-cut than it really is. The night Getafe finally picked up a point, Real Sociedad manager Imanol Alguacil insisted: “I have no doubt Míchel’s a great coach. If you have patience with him, Getafe will climb the table.” Míchel had waited a year to take over and brought a new, possession-based style that was always likely to take a little time and luck, plus the players to play it, but he didn’t get that. Even Sánchez Flores admitted: “Míchel’s a great guy who didn’t get the luck he deserves.” And if fortune always feels empty as an explanation, there was definitely something in that. Against Valencia on the opening day, Getafe had lost 1-0 to a ropey penalty. A 93rd-minute Érik Lamela goal defeated them the following week in Seville. They were unfortunate to lose 2-1 at Barcelona, were beaten 1-0 by Elche, and were 1-0 up against Atlético until Carles Aleñá was sent off, losing 2-1 to a last-minute Luis Suárez winner. In the opening six games only Rayo beat them by more than one – and even then they had hit the post at 0-0. “It’s a question of time,” midfielder Florentino Luís said, but time passed and they kept losing, confidence crumbling. The Elche match brought 20 minutes as bad as anything you’ve seen, like the players’ legs had been put on the wrong way round, like some mental block had taken hold and wouldn’t let go. “You just have to go back to the cinema and hope this time the good guys win,” Míchel said, but they never did.
Perhaps they had to stop being the good guys. Quique changed the mentality and the approach was altered too. He had to break that run somehow, rid them of the fatalism, clear heads and offer a clear plan. Get closer to what they had been with Pepe Bordalás, perhaps: tough, defensive, resistant. Unal soon talked about a side getting its identity back. It wasn’t always pretty, it is true, and it’s not done yet either. Against Levante, the 0-0 felt inevitable. Against Celta, they played four central midfielders and a fifth, Nikola Maksimovic, up front – and lost, heavily. Against Granada, they conceded in the 97th minute to draw 1-1, but it was a miracle the goal hadn’t come sooner and been followed by more. Luis Suárez’s penalty traced an almost impossible vertical trajectory over the bar, David Soria slapped one off the line and Getafe, moving to a back five, had 23% of possession and faced 18 shots. “We didn’t feel good with the ball so we decided to defend,” Quique said. Those were his first three games. After a 0-0 draw with Mallorca in November, Jaume Costa accused Getafe of constant fouling, complaining: “The linesman said they’re smart. Smart? No. Book one and it stops.” But things had shifted, signs of life and rebellion. “We need a big heart and a hungry mind but things only change with a win,” Quique said after Granada and three days later it came, Unal scoring two beauties against Espanyol and Erick Cabaco stumbling down the touchline with the coach in his arms at full-time. “We needed this jubilation to justify the effort,” Quique said. “It’s going to be long and we’re going to suffer: it’s battle for the broken-hearted.” A week on they lost against Villarreal but haven’t lost since. A 4-0 win over Cádiz followed, then three draws: 0-0, 0-0, 1-1. Next, a 93rd-minute Darío Poveda goal defeated Osasuna and finally lifted them out of the relegation zone, 4,772 fans going wild. “We’re a single mind: we’re overcoming small barriers, which makes us freer and braver,” the coach said. “I feel emotional because I feel what I felt 16 years ago.”
Sunday felt even better: victory against Madrid, previously unbeaten in 12 games. “You don’t look at the stats in advance because they can depress you,” Quique said. “Instead, games require an artisanal process that generates enthusiasm as you see what you can do.” Getafe, he said, had to know where to “strangle” Madrid. And although Luka Modric hit the bar and Soria made a superb late save, they did so successfully. Stefan Mitrovic’s insistence that their mentality has changed was echoed in Unal saying he smelt blood on the goal, someone else’s weakness revealed instead of theirs. “We have an important combative spirit; we needed resilience and still do: this has only just begun,” the coach said. In the stands they were jumping about singing, an old favourite adapted for new times. “Bordalás, I loved you,” it runs, “but now I love Quique.” Carry on like this and there might just be a little soft spot for Wilfried Zaha, too.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/getafe-real-madrid-crystal-palace-la-liga-blog
5777;5777;UK care home firm says visitor rules in ‘total imbalance’ to Covid risks;2022-01-03T17:14:43Z;['Robert Booth'];['Social care', 'Health policy', 'Health', 'Society', 'Coronavirus', 'Politics', 'UK news'];One of the UK’s biggest care home operators is calling on the government to lift visiting restrictions after it recorded one Covid death in the last fortnight. Four Seasons Healthcare, which operates 165 care homes, said close to 4,000 residents were living under strict lockdowns because of outbreaks, but the Omicron variant was proving so mild in a well-vaccinated population that limits on seeing family and friends were in “total imbalance” with the risk. Of 132 deaths among the chain’s residents in the last two weeks, just one was attributed to Covid, but because two or more staff or residents have tested positive in 86 homes, indoor visits are now largely banned. That is in step with government guidelines imposed before Christmas amid uncertainty about the danger of the latest coronavirus variant. “We are depriving people of their right to visitors, which is an absolute outrage,” said Jeremy Richardson, the chief executive of the UK’s third largest care home provider. “The government restrictions at the moment are making it very difficult to give people a quality of life.” He added: “We run care homes. We do not run prisons.” Residents and relatives have been left distraught by the further restrictions. Before Christmas the health secretary, Sajid Javid, announced that in England any care home in outbreak should shut its doors to indoor visitors for up to 28 days after the last positive case, except for people designated as essential care givers or if a resident is at the end of life. Movements out of the care home should also be minimised, Javid said. It has meant thousands of families have only been able to see loved ones through windows or in visiting pods. MHA, one of the largest not-for-profit providers, said on Monday that about half of its care homes had had outbreaks that had restricted visiting. The Public Health Agency in Belfast reported that 120 care homes in Northern Ireland currently had outbreaks. The reports suggest care home outbreaks in England are likely to jump sharply, from 250 as of 19 December, in the next UK Health and Security Agency figures. But deaths from Covid in care homes in England, which accommodate 350,000 people, stood at 40 in the week to Christmas Eve, compared with a peak of about 1,800 in a week in January 2021. The latest NHS figures show 95% of care home residents in England have had two vaccine doses and 81% have been boosted. Jenny Morrison, a co-founder of Rights for Residents campaign group, said: “The impact of loneliness and isolation has far outweighed the impact of Covid in the later part of the pandemic, so are we going to continue with these strict visiting policies? It’s completely disproportionate to what we are facing.” Richardson said that since March 2021, 2,320 Four Seasons residents had died from all causes, and only 29 of them (1.25%) from Covid. Over that period the overall death rate has been below the four-year average prior to Covid. Nadra Ahmed, the executive chair of the National Care Association, which represents independent operators, said more than a quarter of her members were facing staffing shortages because of the requirement to isolate for seven days after a positive PCR test. One operator has reported half of its staff off with positive tests or off sick. “The other 50% of staff are exhausting themselves covering the shifts,” she said. Finding agency staff over Christmas was often impossible, and hourly rates had risen as high as £75, she said. Nicola Richards, the chair of the Sheffield Care Association, said PCR test results were taking six days for staff at some local homes, which was “causing huge issues”. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Our priority continues to be the safety of care home residents and staff. We are doing everything we can to support care providers to facilitate safe visits.”;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/03/uk-care-home-firm-says-visitor-rules-in-total-imbalance-to-covid-risks
5778;5778;NHL fan saves life of Canucks staffer after spotting cancerous mole at game;2022-01-03T17:02:49Z;['Maya Yang'];['NHL', 'Vancouver Canucks', 'Seattle Kraken', 'Health', 'Society', 'US sports'];When Nadia Popovici spotted a small mole on the back of Brian Hamilton’s neck last October, during an NHL game between the Vancouver Canucks and the Seattle Kraken, she was unsure if the Canucks’ assistant equipment manager was aware it was there. Gaining Hamilton’s attention, she wrote a message on her phone and pressed it against the plexiglass dividing the crowd from the ice. “The mole on the back of your neck is possibly cancerous,” the 22-year old fan wrote. “Please go see a doctor!” “Mole”, “cancer” and “doctor” were picked out in bright red letters. Popovici later told the Seattle Times that she had volunteered at hospitals, “surrounded with a lot of melanomas”. So when she saw the diameter, raised shape and “irregular border” of the mole on Hamilton’s neck, she knew she had to alert him. Hamilton looked at the message. He later said that he thought: “Well, that’s weird.” He rubbed the back of his neck and continued walking. But later that evening, he asked his partner if she could see the mole. When she said she could, Hamilton consulted a team doctor – who “didn’t like the looks of it either”. Hamilton had the mole removed and tested. It proved to be a type 2 malignant melanoma, a skin cancer that is curable if caught early. Within a week, Hamilton was cancer-free. On Saturday, Hamilton posted a call-out message on the Canucks Twitter page. “I am trying to find a very special person … [who] changed my life,” he wrote. “That evening, 23 October, and the message you showed me on your cellphone will forever be etched into my brain and has made a true life-changing difference for me and my family.” Hamilton added his thanks for the fan who went “to great lengths to get my attention from the stands while I did my job on the Canucks bench. We are looking for this incredible person and we need you to share this with your friends and families to help us find a real-life hero, so I can express my sincerest gratitude.” Within hours, Popovici was found. She had been asleep at home in Tacoma, Washington, after working overnight at a suicide crisis center in Seattle. As a Kraken season ticket-holder, she had already planned to attend that night’s game between the Canucks and Kraken. Both teams invited her to meet Hamilton. “It was your effort and your persistence … the way you wrote it on your phone,” Hamilton said during an emotional meeting. “I owe it to this person to get checked, if she went this far. I don’t know her, I don’t know anything about her.” Popovici told Hamilton: “What an amazing way to start my journey to med school. It’s pretty priceless.” During a timeout in Saturday’s game, the Canucks and Kraken announced a $10,000 scholarship for Popovici, towards medical school tuition. Popovici, who sat in the same seat from which she spotted Hamilton’s mole, was overcome with emotion. The Canucks won 5-2. They later tweeted a picture of Hamilton and Popovici taking a selfie together. The caption: “The biggest win tonight.”;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/canucks-kraken-brian-hamilton-cancerous-mole-nadia-popovici
5779;5779;The risk of a coup in the next US election is greater now than it ever was under Trump | Laurence H Tribe ;2022-01-03T16:50:05Z;['Laurence H Tribe'];['US Capitol attack', 'Republicans', 'Donald Trump', 'US news', 'US politics'];"Only free and fair elections in which the loser abides by the result stand between each of us and life at the mercy of a despotic regime – one we had no voice in choosing and one that can freely violate all our rights. So everything is at stake in the peaceful transfer of power from a government that has lost its people’s confidence to its victorious successor. It was that peaceful transfer that Trump and his minions sought to obstruct and almost succeeded in overthrowing when Joe Biden was elected president. A year has passed since Donald Trump’s attempted coup and his supporters’ violent storming of the United States Capitol on 6 January 2021, in a nearly successful effort to prevent Congress from certifying Trump’s decisive loss of the election to Biden. Watching the images that day of the seat of US democracy overtaken and defiled, it was impossible not to viscerally feel the grave danger that confronted the republic. In the tumultuous year since, the immediacy of that sensation has waned – and the magnitude of the stakes has receded from memory. In the rubble of the insurrection, the sheer shock of the moment jarred loose hints of long-lost bipartisanship and national unity and rekindled an appreciation of why a successful coup would have meant the end of all we care about. The House of Representatives expeditiously moved to impeach Trump for his role in fomenting the attack and 57 senators, including seven Republicans, voted to convict him on 13 February after a masterful presentation led by Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat of Maryland. After Trump had become the first American president to be impeached twice, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, delivered a blistering rebuke of Trump from the Senate floor, justifying his and many other Republicans’ votes to acquit only on the thin reed that, by the time of his Senate trial, Trump was no longer president. Alas, the moment was short-lived. With Trump himself out of office and in exile at Mar-a-Lago, public attention quickly faded, Republicans abandoned their increasingly half-hearted search for accountability, and the leaders of their party began planning their next bite at the poisoned apple of power, an apple they told themselves had been stolen from them despite all evidence to the contrary. Rewriting history and turning reality on its head, Republicans in Congress and their allies in rightwing media began absurdly to describe the deadly insurrection as a “mostly peaceful” protest, described rioters who brutally beat Capitol police as “political prisoners”, and suggested that any violence was attributable to some unidentified group of leftwing “antifa”. To be sure, we have seen the rise of a veritable cottage industry of commentary warning sharply that America remains subject to what some have called a “slow-motion insurrection” or that “Trump’s Next Coup Has Already Begun”. Yet the vast majority of Americans have turned their attention back to other concerns – from new and more infectious variants of the Covid-19 virus, to burgeoning inflation and increasingly palpable signs of global warming, to the myriad other problems that bedevil our nation and the world. But for those of us who have continued to investigate the sources and facets of the assault on constitutional democracy, a sobering realization has become unavoidable: our country, and the legal and political institutions that prevent it from descending into despotism, are in even greater peril today than they were at the time of last November’s election. That assault began in the runup to the 2020 election, when Trump and his cultlike followers spread the corrosive view that American elections had become inherently untrustworthy as demographic changes broadened the eligible electorate and thus that any outcome other than victory for Trump would necessarily be the result of fraud and must therefore be rejected by all means necessary. With each passing day, more details about the means Trump’s team devised to undo the results of the November 2020 election have cascaded into public view, even though Republicans in Congress have made concerted efforts to obstruct the work of the special House committee created to uncover the sources of the attempted coup and the ensuing insurrection. The committee was charged to propose legislation to reduce the danger of a repeat performance, but because curing a disease requires diagnosing its cause, Republicans have seized on the committee’s search for causes to claim that its purposes were solely vindictive and not legislative. In the course of designing possible remedies, the committee has uncovered evidence of a conspiracy broader, more far-reaching and better organized than was initially thought. That conspiracy featured deceptive PowerPoint presentations and duplicitous talking points designed to propagate the big lie that Democrats had indeed stolen the election and to lay out a blueprint for “stopping the steal”. Understanding that blueprint requires appreciating the byzantine constitutional structure dating to our founding, a structure in which the presidency is awarded not to the winner of the national popular vote but to the candidate receiving the most “electoral votes”. Those votes are allocated among the states according to a formula slanted toward less densely populated states – states that have tended over time to favor the Republican candidate – with each state’s legislature determining the method for deciding how its electoral votes will be awarded. As Representative Raskin, a leading member of the special House committee, described it to me, the basic plan for Trump to seize power despite his loss of both the popular vote on 3 November and the electoral vote on 14 December had been to pressure various officials to “find” enough nonexistent votes to flip the results of several key states in which the election’s outcome had been the closest. Failing that, the plan was to pressure Vice-President Mike Pence, presiding over the 6 January joint session of Congress required under the constitution to count the certified electoral votes, to reject and return the slates of electoral votes certified by Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania, depriving both candidates of the requisite majority of the electoral votes cast. At that point, the choice of president would fall “immediately” to the US House of Representatives, with each state’s delegation casting a single vote in the resulting “contingent election”. That in turn would have made Trump the president-elect despite having lost the election, because more state delegations in the House were in Republican hands at that point than in the hands of the Democrats. Part of the plot, we are now learning, featured Trump’s invocation of the Insurrection Act to declare something like martial law to put down the chaos and bedlam he and his inner circle would by then have unleashed on the Capitol, all the time blaming the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, for not keeping order, a form of sinister gaslighting the Republicans have deployed ever since 6 January. Talk of that military option led the CIA Director to predict that “we are on the way to a right-wing coup”. But most terrifyingly, we have learned over the past year that the Republican party plans to do it again. Some retired generals are warning that, without decisive action to hold all the wrongdoers to account, we will witness a march to another coup attempt, and one more likely to succeed, if Trump or another demagogue runs and loses. Trump’s Republican party has all but erased or openly embraced the violence of 6 January. And the party faithful have already set out to use state-level elections and legislative processes to better set the table to steal the 2024 election should that be necessary to their return to power. And why wouldn’t they?
Those involved in the last attempt have – at least as of today – faced few if any social, political or legal penalties. Only the foot-soldiers, those who physically invaded the Capitol, have faced criminal punishment. And even they have been charged with no offense more serious than corruptly obstructing an official proceeding. As I have elsewhere argued, it would seem more fitting to charge those who organized, funded, and otherwise led the nearly successful overthrow of our government with insurrection or sedition. Indeed, in the topsy-turvy world of Trumpian logic, the political base of the Republican party now appears by a large majority to believe that the real coup and insurrection took place not on 6 January 2021 but on 3 November and 14 December 2020, when Joe Biden and the Democrats supporting him were guilty of a “big steal” of the national election. Students of how democracies fail and tyrannical regimes arise from the dust they leave behind uniformly teach that such groundless myths of wrongful defeat at the hands either of enemies within or of enemies without are invariably part of the demagogue’s narrative and of its hold on popular consciousness. The specter of another coup attempt in 2024-25 may, at first blush, seem counterintuitive. After all, whether Donald Trump or another aspiring despot runs next time as the Republican party’s nominee, that candidate will have no access to the powers of the presidency when the national election occurs. But the corrupt actions that threaten soon to bring our constitutional republic to an ignoble end sadly do not require either an exercise of presidential power or the abdication of presidential duty. They require only that the cult of Trump repopulate with party hacks the bureaucracy of honest vote-counters and nonpartisan election personnel at the state and local levels, and that Trump-backed lawmakers elected to state legislatures rig the voting rules to dilute the influence of all who might oppose a Republican victory. Because these steps are well under way, we face a challenge more daunting than we did even when the powers of the presidency were in Trump’s hands. Nor can we count on the congressional voting integrity measures brilliantly designed with the help of Adam Schiff and Jamie Raskin, the Democratic representatives who led Trump’s two Senate impeachment trials, to save us from what the growing number of Republican state legislatures seem only too eager to do. For one thing, even before the 2022 midterm elections, Democrats control too few seats in the Senate to overcome the antiquated filibuster rules that make enactment of such voting rights measures with fewer than 60 votes an impossibility. For another, the US supreme court, as packed by means of dubious legitimacy by Trump during his presidency, is poised to hold unconstitutional virtually any meaningful voting protection or electoral reform Congress might enact even if that 60-vote obstacle could be carved away in a limited class of cases. Even if something should derail another Trump run at the presidency, the means for another coup exist, and the temptation to seize power, this time cementing it more permanently, will surely tantalize a political party that seems openly hostile to the very premises of democracy. Of particular concern to students of fascism – a governing form that almost always comes wrapped in violence – was the violence woven through the rise of Trumpism to the siege of the Capitol which was, of course, brutally violent. Participants came armed with body armor, firearms, knives, bear mace, Tasers and everything in between. They brought a gallows and chanted that they were going to hang the sitting vice-president. They brutally beat Capitol and DC police officers.
Nor was the violence limited to that day. Leading up to the 2020 election, Trump supporters had run a Biden campaign bus off the road in Texas, plotted to kidnap the Democratic governor in Michigan and stirred up brutal attacks across the country. In the period after that election, they physically surrounded and intimidated senators on an airplane and in an airport, calling them “traitors” and promising consequences for their perceived defection from Trump. They showed up at state capitols armed to the teeth and threatening retribution if state legislators did not allocate their electoral votes to Trump, or at least pursue fraudulent “audits” of the election results. Far from being condemned, in the intervening year that sort of violence has been increasingly glorified by the mainstream conservative movement. In recent weeks, a congressman posted a Photoshopped video of himself murdering a Democratic colleague. A Fox News host discussed – to a crowd of radicalized anti-vaxxers – how they might most appropriately assassinate our nation’s chief epidemiologist with a “kill shot” in “an ambush”. Large crowds venerated a juvenile vigilante who shot three people on an American street. The base is being primed for more violence in the run-up and aftermath of the next election. And the Trump-packed supreme court is poised to do its part by gutting what is left of America’s laws against carrying guns anywhere and everywhere – including maybe in courthouses, polling places and the like. It is no accident that the 6 January hotel command center of the group led by Steve Bannon and Roger Stone was christened the “war room”. So what is to be done? We must resist state-level attempts to make voting more difficult. Instead, we must make vote-counting easier and use all legal means at our disposal to challenge publicly and in state and federal courts legislative district maps designed to dilute minority voters’ influence or to amplify the power of incumbency, as well as laws empowering state officeholders to designate presidential electors at odds with their state’s popular election results. We must use boycotts and grassroots political organizing to oppose the replacement of honest with corrupt election officials and the enactment of anti-democratic state laws. We must encourage the 6 January committee to complete its work thoroughly but quickly, including holding public hearings that spotlight the damning details of the plot that nearly succeeded, and making criminal referrals to the Department of Justice of all public officials – from members of Congress to the former president – suspected of such federal crimes as obstructing an official proceeding, aiding and abetting an insurrection or conspiring to commit sedition. We must fight back against suggestions that the justice department’s criminal investigations of the highest-ranking public officials should await any such criminal referrals from the committee. We must redouble our determination to hold criminally accountable, and potentially disqualify from ever again holding public office in the United States, everyone involved in the obscene trashing of constitutional democracy. We must publicly repudiate whatever misguided notions have led the Biden administration’s attorney general, Merrick Garland, to exercise extraordinary restraint in the pursuit of such full accountability, effectively placing the highest officeholders above the law. Above all, we must not let the difficulty of the task ahead turn realism into resignation and sap the energy we will need to bring to this mission. As the distinguished Yale historian Joannne Freeman recently wrote, “Accountability – the belief that political power holders are responsible for their actions and that blatant violations will be addressed – is the lifeblood of democracy. Without it, there can be no trust in government, and without trust, democratic governments have little power.” And when democracy loses its grip as a guiding ideal, despotism fills the void and liberty is lost. This is a battle we must not, cannot, will not lose.

5780;5780;William Hill faces fine after giving incorrect data to regulator;2022-01-03T16:45:46Z;['Rob Davies'];['William Hill', 'Gambling', 'Regulators', 'UK news', 'Business'];"The bookmaker William Hill could be fined after it emerged that it submitted incorrect data to the Gambling Commission. The information forced the regulator to tear up its analysis of the impact Covid-19 has had on betting habits. Responding to concern that successive lockdowns could drive people to bet too much online, the Gambling Commission has published regular updates since March 2020 on how much customers of big firms such as William Hill are losing. But in an update published on 23 December, the regulator said it had discovered that William Hill provided “incorrect datapoints” for the 16 months between March 2020 and September 2021. As a result, the commission said it would have to re-analyse all its data and would not be able to publish correct information until February. The regulator’s statistical bulletins during Covid-19, which rely on submissions from firms with 80% of the UK market, are seen as a key resource for academics and health workers trying to assess how the pandemic affected gambling-related harm. The commission said it was now “reviewing any regulatory consequences of William Hill’s failure to submit accurate data”. The regulator’s powers allow it to suspend or revoke gambling operators’ licence, although in practice it does so only in extreme cases. However, it frequently reaches financial settlements with companies that transgress the terms of their licence to offer gambling services in Great Britain. The risk of a penalty comes as William Hill’s UK operation is in the process of a £2.2bn sale, after London-listed 888 Holdings bought it from the US casino operator Caesars Entertainment.
William Hill’s data error means it is one of two major operators braced for the possibility of a financial penalty in early 2022, just as the government is putting the finishing touches to a review of how gambling is regulated, with proposals set to be announced in the spring. The Guardian revealed in November that the online casino SkyVegas, owned by Flutter, had sent “free spin” promotions to thousands of people trying to recover from gambling addiction. The Guardian has approached William Hill for comment.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/03/william-hill-faces-fine-after-giving-incorrect-data-to-regulator
5781;5781;Heads warn of weeks of Omicron disruption in English schools;2022-01-03T16:38:10Z;['Sally Weale'];['Schools', 'Teaching', 'Coronavirus', 'Primary schools', 'Secondary schools', 'Education', 'England', 'UK news'];"School leaders in England are warning of weeks of disruption owing to high levels of staff Covid absences, which could lead to children being sent home to learn remotely. One secondary headteacher said he and 26 of his staff had tested positive for the virus, while others were having to stay at home to look after their own children as nurseries were closed, also because of Covid absences. As the impact of the spread of Omicron over Christmas becomes apparent in Covid data, heads said it was inevitable that some classes and year groups would be sent home to learn remotely because schools would not have sufficient teachers or supply cover. A number of headteachers and one leading education union have expressed concern about new government advice to combine classes in the event of staff shortages, warning that it risks spreading Covid further and increasing disruption. In an email sent to schools on Sunday, the Department for Education (DfE) advised heads to deal with staff absence by teaching larger groups, but school leaders said this was not a workable long-term solution, with one warning it could lead to something “like a scene out of Mad Max”.
Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Schools and colleges desperately want to be able to maintain face-to-face teaching on a consistent basis, but the reality is that if large numbers of staff are absent this will cause disruption, which may include having to send home classes or year groups for short periods of time to learn remotely.” Meanwhile, heads are preparing for “difficult conversations” with some parents after the government called for masks to be worn in classrooms, while others are dealing with time-consuming subject access requests and freedom of information requests over vaccination programmes from anti-vaccination groups. Boris Johnson said on Monday he was not happy about calling for masks in classrooms but it was a necessary step. “There’s an increasing body of scientific support for the idea that face masks can contain transmission. I don’t like the idea of having face masks in [the] classroom any more than anybody else does, but we won’t keep them on a day more than is necessary,” he said. With the risk of widespread disruption to schools, Oak National Academy, the national online classroom set up by government when the pandemic first hit, is preparing for increased demand. “Schools and teachers are doing all they can to make sure pupils have a smooth return to the classroom after the holidays,” said Oak’s principal, Matt Hood. “For those children who cannot be in the classroom, Oak National Academy stands ready to support them.” Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it was “alarming” that the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, was advocating combining classes of pupils to overcome staff shortages. “Collapsing classes will mix groups of pupils and risks providing the conditions for the virus to spread more rapidly, which will result in greater pupil and staff absence,” she said. ‘A sense of trepidation’ Ben Davis is the headteacher of St Ambrose Barlow RC high school in Greater Manchester, which opens to pupils again on Thursday with a phased return to allow each year group to be tested for Covid. “I do feel a sense of trepidation,” he said. Masks have been reintroduced into classrooms in his school twice previously on the recommendation of Public Health England because of high infection rates, and Davis had to send a number of year groups home before Christmas owing to staff absence. As the spring term gets under way Davis fears there will be more of the same and is worried about the impact on summer exams. “My expectation is there will be quite a lot of disruption over the next few weeks and we will have year groups working from home.” Glyn Potts, the head of Blessed John Henry Newman RC College in Oldham, has himself tested positive for Covid and will not be in school at the start of term. A further 26 staff have also tested positive and he is waiting to find who will be out of isolation and available for work when pupils begin to return to school on Thursday. “What we are going to get on our return are absences of staff and children and a large number of challenging conversations with parents – those who are for or against masks and vaccinations – all of which distracts and takes time,” he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/03/heads-warn-of-weeks-of-omicron-disruption-in-english-schools
5782;5782;Are you having a laugh? Why NHS doctors will soon be prescribing a dose of comedy;2022-01-03T16:31:09Z;['N/A'];['Health & wellbeing', 'Comedy', 'Life and style', 'Health', 'Mental health', 'Bristol', 'Psychology'];"Name: Comedy. Age: The term comedy (from the Greek κωμῳδία, or kōmōidía) originated in ancient Greece, where poets would perform political satire in theatres in order to influence voters. Armando Iannucci, that kind of thing? More like Aristophanes, but yeah, he was the Iannucci of his day. To be fair, people have been trying to make each other laugh since people have been people. Biblical scholars have even found comedy in Genesis. Would you Adam and Eve it? So why is Pass notes, a topical column in a newspaper, fussed about it now? Because comedy is always changing and finding new ways to express itself – and to be delivered or prescribed. I think you mean proscribed. This is about cancel culture and freedom of speech, right? No and no. I mean prescribed. Prescribed by whom? Who normally prescribes things? Doctors, of course. OK, explanation required, please. Angie Belcher, a comedian in residence at the University of Bristol, has been working with health advisers to develop comedy sessions to help patients recover from trauma. Laughter is the best medicine. That is the idea. “Comedy is a force for good [that] can change people’s lives,” said Belcher. The course will be delivered through the Bristol-based charity Wellspring Settlement by the professional comedians Charmian Hughes and Jack Campbell. Participants – who might, say, be experiencing gender dysmorphia, depression, anxiety, PTSD or bereavement – will be able to take part in sessions that not only explore their ailments, but also look for the humour in them. Sounds brilliant. How much? Free! Bristol GPs will be able to prescribe the pilot course on the NHS from this month.
It’s not a new idea, is it, that comedy might be helpful at difficult times? True. Many comedians – including Russell Brand, Sarah Millican, Simon Amstell and Jimmy Carr – have written about mental health in their books. Ruby Wax went a step further: she studied psychotherapy, got a master’s in mindfulness-based cognitive behaviour from Oxford, delivered a Ted Talk and received an OBE for services to mental health. Jack Dee, too, no? Hmm, kind of. His latest book, What Is Your Problem?, is spoof self-help. He sets himself up as an agony uncle after studying online for four hours at the Ruislip College of Advansed (sic) Learning. Ha! Yeah, it’s funny; it’ll help. Do say: “So, anyway, have I told you about the time my dog died?” Don’t say: Nothing. It’s good to talk.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/03/are-you-having-a-laugh-why-nhs-doctors-will-soon-be-prescribing-a-dose-of-comedy
5783;5783;The Matildas should not forget about Katrina Gorry ahead of 2023 World Cup | Joey Lynch;2022-01-03T16:30:07Z;['Joey Lynch'];"['A-League Women', 'Brisbane Roar', 'Football', 'Sport', ""Women's football"", 'Matildas']";"With fewer than 60 seconds remaining in regular time of Brisbane Roar’s clash with Melbourne Victory, Natalie Tathem – making her return from a 12-month ACL injury – drove down the right flank before delivering a low cross that Shea Connors, just, reached first to bundle over the goal line. After being 2-0 down at half-time from an own-goal and a fortunate Lynn Williams effort, the Queenslanders were finally on the right side of a late comeback, with a 3-2 lead that soon turned into 4-2 after Norrie added a 96th-minute sealer.
In the aftermath of Connors’s goal, however, as the rest of her teammates moved back into position for kick-off, the lone, diminutive figure of Katrina Gorry hobbled off: spent after putting in a player-of-the-match performance that had not only inspired the Roar to their first win of the season but reminded everyone that, for all the excitement surrounding a new generation of Matildas being brought through by Tony Gustavsson, a potential answer to the national team’s midfield predicament may lie in the re-establishment of the 2014 AFC women’s player of the year. Less than six months after giving birth and fewer than three after writing that she was unsure if she was going to be available for round one, Gorry has quickly re-emerged as one of the Roar’s most important figures during the nascent 2021-22 A-League Women season and, assuming she continues on her current trajectory, one of the best players in the competition. After coming off the bench in her side’s first two games and managing only 45 minutes in the round-three defeat to Victory, Gorry got through 90 minutes in each of the past two rounds. Funnily enough, those two fixtures were the first in which Roar picked up points this season. Despite her limited action and role in the midfield, she ranks eighth in the league for shots on target per 90 minutes among qualified players. On Sunday, the 29-year-old proved integral to Roar’s attempts to advance the ball up the field, served as an important – and stabilising – touchstone for her side in possession, and delivered an equalising goal which not only demonstrated what she is capable of producing with the ball at her feet but also how she’s able to operate without the ball to make all that possible. Gifted extra space to operate in the midfield thanks to Kyra Cooney-Cross’s red card, she slid into a position to the right of Mindy Barbieri to show for a pass from Mariel Hecher, adjusting her alignment so she could receive a ball to feet – itself a rare request in tight areas in Australian football. Her Brazilian teammate found her, and she attacked the space afforded by a retreating Victory back four. Before Emma Robers had a chance to scramble across she let loose with a chipped effort that sailed perfectly over the head of Victory goalkeeper Melissa Maizels. She was mobbed by teammates, but not before a rock-the-baby celebration in the direction of daughter Harper in the AAMI Park stands – a dedication of her first goal since becoming a mother to her new baby. That Gorry’s star turn came in direct competition with Matildas breakout player Cooney-Cross was fitting. Though both arguably perform better further up the field, the pair’s best path to national team minutes under Gustavsson heading into 2023 likely means competing for a deep-lying midfield role. And while Gorry’s performance wasn’t perfect – a lazy turnover in the 30th minute indicative of both some level of rust and a lingering preference to play the ball to a familiar teammate and fellow Matilda Larissa Crummer – she won the battle between the two on Sunday.
Both bring their own strengths and weaknesses but, as Gorry has already begun to hint at in her return this season, she holds a rare skill set; a coolness under pressure and the ability to make good decisions rapidly. Such attributes set her apart from her contemporaries and make her considerably more press-resistant than most of Australia’s options in the midfield. When taking into account the Matildas’ issues playing against defences with the ability to prevent transition and force them to break down a low block, her ability to advance play by passing forwards rather than side to side, dribbling between the lines, or simply by taking positions that force a defensive reaction – and, by extension, open up space for others – shapes as a potentially crucial weapon for when the world descends on Australia and New Zealand for the 2023 World Cup. Is it a case of one or the other? Absolutely not. At just 19, Cooney-Cross represents the future of the Matildas and, as she matures and gains more exposure to top-flight football – potentially in a major European league – she can only improve on an already-impressive base. But in an environment of considerable hype over Cooney-Cross, Mary Fowler, Clare Wheeler, and more, do not forget about Gorry. This month’s Asian Cup may prove a bridge too far, but 2023 – a goal she herself has set – looms large.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/the-matildas-should-not-forget-about-katrina-gorry-ahead-of-2023-world-cup
5784;5784;‘What do we do with our finite life?’: how Covid reframed our relationship with ourselves;2022-01-03T16:30:07Z;['Rafqa Touma'];['Life and style', 'Mental health', 'Society', 'Coronavirus', 'Psychology', 'Australian lifestyle'];"“Every disruption is a point of potential growth,” says associate professor Terry Bowles of the University of Melbourne. And we have experienced quite a period of disruption. Unprecedented change overwhelmed us in 2020 and 2021. Enduring the Covid pandemic has meant living through drastic adjustments to social and professional environments, an intense restriction of movement and choice, and prolonged bouts of social distancing and isolation. “What this disruption does is pressure us to make decisions we otherwise wouldn’t make,” Bowles says. Covid has “literally made us step up” to make changes in our lives that are “quite radical”.
“Covid, for a lot of people, will be a new opportunity.” Guardian Australia asked readers to share how the pandemic made them rethink their life. Alongside more than 100 reader responses, leading experts on mental health and wellbeing say Covid has transformed people’s sense of self, and the way wellbeing, priorities and identity are being though about. Experiencing major change that makes us reassess our sense of self is “part of normal life”, says Dr Amy Dawel, a clinical psychologist and senior lecturer at the Australian National University’s College of Health and Medicine. “From divorce to a major move, having children or starting a new job – they are usually personal disruptions that make you reassess parts of your life and identity,” Dawel says. What is unusual about the disruption of the past two years, she says, is that it has been “forced upon us” on a mass scale. “There is less autonomy, and a much greater sense of uncertainty.” At first, Australians felt “distant” from and “unaffected” by the Covid pandemic, Bowles says. “Unfortunately, that slowly changed” Now, almost two years on, a widespread social disruption caused by Covid still permeates with “elements of distress at a universal level”. Skewing lives socially, professionally and financially, adapting with Covid “grinds people down to fatigue and distress”, Bowles says. “And it has prompted changes that have altered entire identities.” Such involuntary change and loss of control has a “massive impact” on wellbeing, says Prof Nicolas Cherbuin, head of the Australian National University’s Centre for Research on Ageing, Health and Wellbeing. “When a person has a sense they can control their lives, they tend to flourish more. And what we experienced with Covid was a generalised loss of control.
“We were told to go home, to change the way you socialise, change the way you work.” Simultaneously, “the way a person defines themselves” with markers of identity – such as roles in a family, workplace or community group – were upended. Some academics have observed this as “social role disruption”, alongside the more general disruption in society. “This all has a major impact on our agency, and who we think we are,” Cherbuin says. Suddenly, one’s perception of self is very different, Dawel says. “Changing dramatically the context we are living in changes the way we fit in it.” Bowles says that while some adjust quickly, others will need “serious support”. However, amid the disruption has come the potential for personal development. In an attempt to regain agency, Bowles says, “people have been adapting”, albeit at varying rates. ‘A mass redirection of priorities’ A discontent during Covid times has encouraged people to “reflect on what they want out of life, study, retirement”, Bowles says. “People will ask themselves a lot of questions about values. We will ask ourselves why we do things.” Cherbuin calls it a mass redirection of priorities. Many responses from Guardian Australia readers reflected Cherbuin’s observation that people are quitting jobs and reassessing work, “because they realise their work habits are unsustainable”. Various other themes emerged as well. Popularly, realisations about relationships. Some readers wrote of new appreciation for social connections. “I don’t need a lot of stuff to be happy, but I do need connection to people,” one said. Others wrote of “reassessing” whether certain relationships are “worth it”. Many shared the experience of ending a long-term relationship or marriage in the midst of Covid. For one reader, following the end of their marriage, “lockdowns actually gave me pace to process this, reclaim my home and heal”.
Cherbuin says that, similarly, lifestyles have been reassessed and “people have taken up new activities”. Many respondents wrote of learning to bake, growing a vegetable garden, starting yoga and and getting into running. For many, during the last years of disruption, personal health became a bigger focus. Studies by the Alcohol and Drug Foundation, for instance, suggest 23% of Australians started to exercise more and 25% fit in more hours sleep. As well, 13.9% of people said they increased alcohol consumption during lockdowns in 2020, while slightly more (14.7%) said they were drinking less. Readers reflected this mix but shared healthier habits, such as reducing alcohol consumption or stopping smoking during Covid, with one respondent writing: “I no longer want to go to events where drinking alcohol is the main activity.” The rethinking of priorities, and the logistical opportunity for white-collar workers in particular to not need to live near their workplaces, prompted the biggest migration from cities to the regions in Australia’s history. Considering relocation, particularly to areas outside the boundaries of a city, was another lifestyle change considered by some readers for whom cities had begun to lose appeal. “I would like to leave Melbourne and live in a more rural environment,” one respondent wrote. “I moved to Melbourne for the music scene and arts culture but now it’s not as important to me as it was before the pandemic.” With lockdowns, disconnection from friends and loved ones and generalised anxiety during the pandemic, psychological distress increased overall. So too did attention to one’s own mental health, and that of others around us. Mental health and wellbeing has emerged as an important priority for readers, with multiple respondents sharing that, during the pandemic, they reached out to mental health professionals for the first time. While self-harm among teenagers increased, the feared increase in suicides in society as a whole did not come to pass as individuals were encouraged to take care of their mental health by everyone from the prime minister to kindergarten classroom teachers.
“Covid has given people a reason to say: it is OK to feel not OK,” Dawel says. “It has legitimised seeking help for mental health reasons.” Cherbuin echoes this: “Now, more people are going to see mental health as not just a distant problem some people have. What Covid has done is prompt this broader realisation of what mental health and wellbeing means to anyone and everyone, including myself.” “I think it is one of the really positive things to come out of Covid,” Dawel says. Into the future Across every facet of people’s lives, both major and minor changes have been assessed and adopted. Underlying them are important shifts in mindset. One reader, who left her job, ended a long-term relationship, adopted animals and plans to start a company in 2022, writes: “I changed nearly everything.” For Brian Mulquiney, 70, from Queensland’s Gold Coast,“the pandemic created the catalyst to reassess what is important in life”. Bowles says it comes down to a simple explanation: “We have all become closer to death. Out of Covid, the next most obvious thing to think is: what to do with what we have left of a finite life?” While Bowles says Covid has given some people a “platform from which you’d leap when you otherwise wouldn’t”, others will just be “breaking even” and “trying to sustain themselves”. Universally, however, he says Covid has “supercharged” disruptive experiences. “We all went through the changes. Everyone can identify with it.” In the past, world wars have prompted structural changes, such as introducing women to the workforce. Dawel says she is interested to see what sticks post-pandemic, particularly when it comes to people “figuring out who they are, and their perception of how the world works”. Cherbuin thinks it is less likely people will “click back into old ways”. “I think there will be positive health and social consequences in the long term.” From structural changes in the workplace to personal changes to lifestyle and habits, “all these changes have been demonstrated to be possible”, Cherbuin says. “It means that now things that couldn’t be done before can be done.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/what-do-we-do-with-our-finite-life-how-covid-reframed-our-relationship-with-ourselves

As a B-grade cult band, we are excited. We’ve been on the road for eons, on an endless European tour for our fifth album Tallulah, before veering to the US and Australia. We’re booked to play at 6pm on one of the smaller stages. I wander around the backstage village and share a cookie with another band member. I had bought the cookie from an ingratiating post-punk hippie. My musician mate disappears. I lean against a tent post. Usually I see many variables, yet I’m fixed. I wonder who might rescue me as time stands still. Crew, musicians and caterers walk past me in slomo. Eventually the ritual of making it to the stage takes over. I find my way to our lot which looks like the dining room of a train carriage. I flop beside three band members.
Bob Johnson, our long-serving manager, berates me for looking like a grub. “Look at your T-shirt, it’s covered in stains.” I look down at my mucky white tee and I am Eliza Doolittle picked from the street. The gig is exhilarating. We play with our usual love to a crowd that stretches for ever and who gets us. And after, Chrissie Hynde from the Pretenders walks on to the stage and kisses it because Bob Dylan once stood there. I avoid Geoff Travis from Rough Trade Records – I don’t care that he dropped us for the Smiths; I’m incapable of the cleverness he expects from me. We hang out backstage with the Woodentops and Voice of the Beehive. Fellow Australian band Hoodoo Gurus are on the bill and drive us back to the hotel in Copenhagen. Many musicians are milling in the large, ultramodern foyer of glass, tiles and bulky pot plants. A large staircase descends from the floors above, giving the room a sense of grandeur. Then a commotion. The Hoodoo Gurus’ crew are stuck in the elevator on the first floor. I rush up the stairs, peering in. The Gurus’ tour manager is a large man and he’s struggling. I’m talking him through it when another crew member arrives and we stand, peering in, together. “I want one thing,” says the tour manager trapped in the lift. “Just get her away from me now.” I thought my counselling skills were good but they are not on this day; somehow, they elude me this day. Back in the foyer, Clyde Bramley, bass player with the Gurus, demands that something be done. Where is that firetruck that was called 20 minutes ago? Clyde is maddened. The crew in the lift are disturbed. The foyer is a mass of competing energies – the staff calming, the musicians agitating.
Clyde is done. He picks up an enormous pot plant and smashes it to the ground. “Get them some help,” he bawls. With minutes, hurtling down the stairwell, is Michael McMartin, the Gurus’ manager, catching Clyde in a headlock, holding him tight to his chest on the stairs till he calms. Robert Vickers, the Go-Betweens’ bass player, whispers to me: “I know what that feels like?” I ask: “What do you mean?” He replies, face as dead as a dead pan: “The pressure of touring. Late nights, early mornings, hurry up and wait, always trying to do your best, I know how Clyde feels.”";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/04/the-go-betweens-lindy-morrison-ill-never-forget-playing-roskilde-when-chaos-hit-the-hoodoo-gurus
5786;5786;How to move: with chronic back pain;2022-01-03T16:30:07Z;['N/A'];['Fitness', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Back pain', 'Life and style', 'Australian lifestyle'];"Back pain is the most common form of chronic pain, with about 4 million people living with it in Australia. The most effective way to manage chronic back pain is with a multidisciplinary approach, of which exercise is a key component. “Any single treatment in low back pain is never enough by itself,” says Associate Prof Michael Vagg, a pain medicine physician and dean of the faculty of pain medicine at the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists. “But exercise is a fundamental part of recovering from low back pain and managing it if it becomes persistent.” But people who have suffered from back pain for a long time might feel fearful of moving. Dr Matthew Bagg, a physiotherapist and pain scientist at Curtin University, says the first big challenge for people with chronic back pain is understanding that pain is not an accurate indication of the robustness of their body. “Regardless of how they feel, they are not broken, damaged or falling apart.”
“If it hurts to do something, people are likely to do less of it,” Vagg says. But those who remain active tend to have better outcomes in the long term. “Even when we experience back pain, it doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be moving.” “Pain itself isn’t an issue,” agrees Dr Rob Laird, a musculoskeletal physiotherapist. But increasing pain during and after exercise is a red flag, he says. “Exercise should reduce, not increase, pain.” There is limited evidence to suggest that one type of exercise is better than another when it comes to chronic back pain. “The best exercise is one that you will keep doing and enjoy,” Vagg says. Laird says physical activity for chronic back pain should include three domains: strength, mobility, and cardiovascular fitness. Consulting a GP or a physiotherapist before starting an exercise routine for chronic back pain is strongly recommended. But here are some practical tips that can help you stay active. The class: pilates In a study published in October in the Journal of Physiotherapy, Bagg and his colleagues conducted a statistical analysis that combined the results of multiple clinical trials of exercise therapies for people with long-term back pain. They found some evidence suggesting that pilates exercise might have the most significant effects on pain intensity. Pilates classes include a series of exercises that focus on the stability and mobility of the body, particularly the spine, core and pelvic area. It emphasises the “neutral spine position” – the natural curves in our spine that provide stability and mobility for taking on the weight and pressure of our bodies. Pilates exercises also help strengthen legs and gluteal muscles, shoulders and arms. The move: single knee squat Laird advises strengthening lower limb and gluteal muscles because these are the muscles we use when we bend or move from sitting to standing. “If they are underdone, the back muscles have to work harder.” Because exercising legs and glutes does not involve excessively recruiting back muscles, he says, most people feel safe doing it. Laird suggests beginning with the classic pilates roll down and progressing to single knee squats. To start a roll down, imagine standing against a wall, then think of peeling your spine off the wall one vertebra at a time, beginning by tucking the chin in, rolling the neck and slowly going down to the pelvis. Your knees are slightly bent, and you might feel some pressure in your hamstrings. To come back up, roll the pelvis first, then the spine, one vertebra at a time. Neck and head come up last.
The second part of the exercise targets the gluteus maximus. Roll down again one vertebra at a time, place one hand on a chair to balance and lift one foot off the ground. Bend the knee of the standing leg, then push through the heel and come back up. Aim to five to 10 repetitions and change side. Reduced mobility of the spine has a poor impact on back function, Laird says. A simple exercise that can help improve back mobility is the cat-cow stretch. Start in a four-point kneeling position with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips. Breathing in, allow your stomach to drop down slowly and tilt your pelvis forward. As you exhale, arch your back up by tucking your tailbone in and pulling your belly button in towards your spine. The activity: walking, cycling, swimming Laird says brisk walks, cycling or swimming are great ways to include cardiovascular fitness in your training. These are all activities most people with chronic back pain can do, he says. “Cardiovascular fitness is essential. If you are not fit enough to walk around the block easily, you are going to struggle with life in general, and pain is still going to be a real problem.” The hard pass: running Laird does not encourage taking up running. “Running is not recommended at the start of a recovery plan but can be used in younger patients towards the middle to end of their recovery plan,” he says. “It’s less useful in older patients – over 60 approximately, although there are always some exceptions – because of the impact loading when there is significant degenerative change already present.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/how-to-move-with-chronic-back-pain
5787;5787;Home and dry: what to do with clothes that have been caught in the rain;2022-01-03T16:30:07Z;['Lucianne Tonti'];['Fashion', 'Australian fashion', 'Life and style', 'DIY'];"Getting caught in the rain is depicted on screen with near-comic frequency. From make-out scenes in Nicholas Sparks film to the drama of Shawshank Redemption and Point Break, stormy skies have long been a marker of heightened emotions, desperate declarations and a willingness to well, get wet. With La Niña weather patterns already making this a particularly wet Australian summer, on the upside, we can plan grand romantic gestures with a little more oomph. But this doesn’t mean our clothes have to suffer. Here’s how to care for your outfit after that dramatic downpour pash. The 101 When you get home after being caught in the rain, assess what you’re wearing and how drenched it is to determine what to do next. Corey Simpson, a communications manager for clothing company Patagonia, says: “Some material may not need any care after being caught in the rain; others, like natural fabrics, may need to be dried.”
Garments like coats and jackets that have natural water resistance can just be shaken out or wiped off, while t-shirts, jumpers and pants that have absorbed rainwater will require more attention. Once you’ve taken wet clothes off, it’s best not to leave them sitting in a pile or inside a clothes basket, as this can result in mildew and smells. Damp clothes should be hung on a rack to dry or washed straight away. If you’ve been particularly adventurous (or unlucky) and your clothes are dirty as well as wet, Simpson says to “wipe off chunks of mud and debris” first, “then wash the garment according to the manufacturer’s instructions”.
For delicate fabrics like fine wool and silk, a trip to the dry cleaner may be in order to prevent water stains. Re-upping repellence Simpson says synthetic fabrics coated “with a durable water repellent usually fare best in the rain” but they also require special treatment to maintain their performance. Unfortunately, water repellence doesn’t last forever. It can be affected by dirt, your skin’s natural oils, sunscreen and smoke, so it’s important to keep your raincoat or puffer jacket clean. Simpson says: “Be sure to wash and dry your garment often – this helps remove oils and anything that can hinder the performance of your puffer or raincoat.”
Check the care instructions, but most nylon or polyester rain jackets and waterproof shells are machine washable. Use a performance wear-specific cleaner (Simpson recommends Grangers). Proper drying is also important to maintain water-repellent properties. Raincoats should be run through the dryer on medium heat for at least half an hour, he suggests. If care instructions permit, ironing can also improve water-repellent properties, but this should be done over a towel on a very low heat to avoid melting your jacket.
For less technical rain garments – like waxed cotton parkas or poly-cotton trench coats – it is best to follow the care instructions on the label. Ironically, some rain-repellent trench coats can be dry clean only. Puffer jackets should be washed with a down-specific detergent, and can take a long time to dry. They should be left to drip dry for between 24 to 48 hours, while being given the occasional fluff to prevent the down from clumping. When almost dry, put the puffer in the dryer on a low heat with some dryer balls to completely break up any remaining clumps. If the water-repellent properties of your outerwear have diminished after a few years of wear, the good news is you can apply a fresh layer. Patagonia recommends the wash-in or spray-on products from Nikwax – which also work on waxed cotton. Special care for shoes
Getting caught in the rain is the number one reason to waterproof your shoes and sneakers when you first buy them. Jenny Velakoulis, the owner of Evans Leather Repair, says to apply three coats of a waterproofing spray to your leather shoes, then reapply every six months. The same goes for sneakers. Eugene Cheng, the founder of Sneaker Laundry, a maintenance service in Melbourne, says the first and most important step is protection. A waterproofing spray will form a barrier around the sneaker, making it easier to care for. If the rain has already got to your shoes, before drying them out, make sure they’re clean. Use a material-specific shampoo to prevent dirt from drying into the shoe, then place leather shoes somewhere dry, away from heaters and out of direct sunlight to dry off. Once dry, apply a balm to nourish the leather. For sneakers that have been soaked, take out the laces and insoles and leave them outside in the sun. Cheng warns that sneakers can get mouldy if they’re put in closets or left indoors while wet.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/home-and-dry-what-to-do-with-clothes-that-have-been-caught-in-the-rain
5788;5788;T-cells can fight Omicron when antibodies fail to, Australian researchers say;2022-01-03T16:30:06Z;['Tory Shepherd'];['Health', 'Science', 'Australia news', 'Coronavirus', 'World news'];"Human bodies have a second line of defence against Covid that offers hope in the global fight against the Omicron variant, Australian researchers say. University of Melbourne research, done in conjunction with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, has found T-cells should be able to tackle the virus. Omicron has a higher number of mutations than other variants, which means it can sometimes slip past the antibodies produced by vaccination or infection. But if it does enter the body, the T-cells – white blood cells that originate in the marrow – will attack. • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
The research has just been published in the peer-reviewed journal Viruses. Co-leader of the research, the University of Melbourne’s Matthew McKay, said while it was a preliminary study, it was “positive news”. “Even if Omicron, or some other variant for that matter, can potentially escape antibodies, a robust T-cell response can still be expected to offer protection and help to prevent significant illness,” he said. “These results overall would suggest that broad escape from T-cells is very unlikely. “Based on our data, we anticipate that T-cell responses elicited by vaccines and boosters, for example, will continue to help protect against Omicron, as observed for other variants. We believe this presents some positive news in the global fight against Omicron.” The team studied fragments of Covid’s viral proteins – called epitopes – from patients that had been vaccinated or infected. Among the epitopes that had the Omicron mutation, more than half were predicted to still be visible to T-cells, HKUST research assistant professor and study co-lead Ahmed Abdul Quadeer said. “This further diminishes the chance that Omicron may escape T-cells’ defences,” he said. The paper’s authors warn that T-cell responses alone do not block infection and therefore prevent transmission. However, the T-cell immunity provides hope of a protection against severe disease. Dr Stuart Turville, from the University of New South Wales’ Kirby Institute, has been studying samples from people infected with Omicron. He said T-cells represent a “pretty good backup” in the immune response. That response is multi-factorial, he said, as both T-cells and B-cells (which produce antibodies) develop a “memory” of the virus that attacks the body.
“At the beginning, what gives them that memory is the primary encounter,” Turville said. “If you’re lucky, it’s a vaccination; if you’re unlucky, it’s the first time you’re infected.” University of Sydney’s Prof Robert Booy, who is also a director of the Immunisation Coalition, said T-cells were an “important backup” to antibodies because they recognise different parts of viruses to produce a response to entire cells, not just their proteins. Australia has a long history of T-cell research, he said. Prof Peter Doherty – the patron of the Peter Doherty Institute, which has been providing Covid modelling – won the Nobel prize in 1996 for his work on T-cell-mediated immunity. Booy also pointed to world-first work being done at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research on how long-term immunity to Covid works, and the possibilities of a T-cell vaccine. The new University of Melbourne research also adds to existing international work that shows the importance of T-cells. South African researchers have found that T-cells can robustly protect against Omicron after it has evaded antibodies. A small South African study that has not yet been peer-reviewed also suggested T-cells have a role to play.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/t-cells-can-fight-omicron-when-antibodies-fail-to-australian-researchers-say
5789;5789;Easy wins: imperfect produce – the perfect solution to food waste;2022-01-03T16:30:06Z;['Rafqa Touma'];['Life and style', 'Food', 'Waste'];"While 5 million Australians go hungry each year, an estimated 7.3m tonnes of food is wasted. In Australia, up to 25% of all vegetables produced never leave the farm, often because they are too oddly shaped for the grocery store. All the while, these reject fruits and vegetables – also known as “imperfect produce” – remain perfectly good to eat.
Though the numbers sound overwhelming, a solution may emerge from the world of small-scale startup subscriptions. Subscription shopping exists not just for the makeup-lovers and book-fanatics. Buying a subscription box of imperfect groceries may just be the most convenient way to simultaneously offload your weekly shop for fresh produce and reduce waste.
Good & Fugly, a produce subscription service based in greater Sydney, delivers boxes of fresh produce direct from the farm. Each box includes staple ingredients – such as potatoes, onions and leafy greens – as well as a variety of changing seasonal produce. A small box of fruit and veg, feeding two people for up to five days, sells for $39. A larger box, feeding five people for up to five days, sells for $59.
Farmer’s Pick, a Melbourne-based service, has found a home for more than 100 tonnes of fresh, oddly bent and sometimes blemished produce. Straight from local farms, the produce varies week-to-week, and subscription options cater to single and family households, with boxes starting at $35. The service also partners with Alex Makes Meals, donating up to seven meals to Victorians facing food insecurity for every box sold. Harris Farm, the family-owned NSW market chain, offers their own imperfect produce service at a discount of up to 50% off on fresh produce through their Imperfect Picks range online. Or, if you want a curated box to save you the trouble of adding to your cart, buy their Imperfect Picks Value Box for $40. Give the strangely-bent carrot or bumpy potato a try and you’ll support local farmers, reduce your contribution to a growing volume of wasted food each year, and you may just find you consume more fresh produce than ever.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/04/easy-wins-imperfect-produce-the-perfect-solution-to-food-waste
5790;5790;I spent a week trying to be counted as a NSW Covid case – I’ve only just succeeded | Christine Tondorf;2022-01-03T16:30:06Z;['Christine Tondorf'];['New South Wales', 'Coronavirus', 'Australia news', 'Health', 'Infectious diseases', 'Hospitals', 'New South Wales politics', 'Australian politics'];"This is not a unique story. I’m trapped in a house with my husband and two teens, and we’re all sick. My 19-year-old son was the first to go down on Tuesday, 28 December. In the morning he developed stomach cramps, vomiting, a migraine and a high fever. I bought him the last rapid antigen test at the local servo. It came up as positive. And so began our efforts to be included in New South Wales’ latest Covid figures. A week later and we are still not part of that count.
I live in northern NSW and last Tuesday was a public holiday. I rang three public hospitals to find out which testing centres were open and learnt that every testing centre was overrun and our chances of getting in were Buckley’s. I was undeterred. My son had severe asthma as a child. Would Omicron trigger his asthma? I’m probably an anxious mother, but I wanted an official diagnosis in case he needed hospital care. I also believe that the state and federal governments need to chart the spread of infection because it’s their job to deliver resources to hospitals and tighten pandemic restrictions to slow infection. I was determined for us to be included in the Covid count.
On Tuesday afternoon we drove to the Byron drive-through testing clinic – the security guard said they couldn’t test any more people. We then headed to Ballina only to be turned away. Lismore and Casino’s drive-throughs were also closed. We went home. My son’s temperature was above 38C that night despite the Nurofen and Panadol. The headaches also started for me. At 6am on Wednesday, my feverish son dragged himself out of bed and I drove him back to a drive-through testing clinic. It was almost 20C, but he wore a hoodie, and brought a blanket and box of tissues. By 9am we’d crawled to the front of the drive-through queue. I told the nurse he had a positive RAT and a history of severe asthma. She said his results would be fast-tracked and back in 50 hours. I was surprised that 50 hours was considered fast, but still grateful he was a priority. We drove home from the testing centre and into the twilight zone. The whole family became unwell, and days of high temperatures, strange dreams, headaches, dizziness and exhaustion followed. Since the summer influx of visitors to the northern rivers, one member of my family has received a Covid exposure site alert every second day. It has been like playing dodgem cars with Covid. We got hit.
Our region is popular with tourists so they add to rapidly increasing case numbers, but it also has a high percentage of elderly and First Nations residents and a limited number of ICU beds. I hope our health system holds in coming weeks. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet has told journalists: “We will tailor our response to the situation that comes. If evidence changes, we will have targeted restrictions in place.” For seven days, we have been trying to contribute to “the evidence”. Yesterday – 122 hours after being swabbed – my son and I received our positive results so I anticipate we will be in today’s figure, exactly a week after he became sick. My husband and daughter will surely be added to the numbers having also been tested. The questions I keep coming back to now are: is the testing system so slow because labs are under-resourced, and the state government did not plan for a contagious new variant and Christmas travel and celebrations causing a surge in cases? Or are numbers rising so quickly it’s simply impossible for labs to keep up? Should we consider Victoria’s lead and look at allowing people to upload RAT results? What is clear though is the latest numbers being given out by government clearly do not reflect daily infection rates. I’ve come to think of the NSW Covid-19 figures as being like a Hubble space telescope – reporting back what happened light years ago.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/i-spent-a-week-trying-to-be-counted-as-a-nsw-covid-case-ive-only-just-succeeded

They’ve been tirelessly working the pubs and clubs of every cranny of Australia while spitting out excellent albums without any lapse in quality or spirit. Sowing Doubt in Magnetic Fields is a mighty shoegaze epic, with huge synths and guitars draped across a dreamy vocal, echoed to infinity and mixed as if performed from atop a mountain. Across eight albums, Royal Chant have proven they can tackle any style in the wider rock canon – and this more expansive sound is a very welcome juncture. Let’s hope they stay on the mountain awhile. For more: The band’s entire catalogue is worthy of your time. Just dive in. Augie March – Clay For fans of: Holly Throsby, Antony and the Johnsons, Leonard Cohen Glenn Richards weaves the most delicate melodies on which to drop his weighty lyrical concepts: on love, life, loss and all the other big Ls that have concerned poets for millennia. Augie March has never betrayed a sense of their own time, with ornate arrangements, antiquated language and songs that slowly unfurl as if being pedalled out through a dusty pianola roll. The basic tracks for Clay were recorded in January 2020, before being shelved for all the obvious considerations. Throughout 2021, Richards pieced together the rest of the song, which he confessed had “been pretty much in the ground as far as I was concerned” before he revisited it. The result is a masterful next chapter for one of Australia’s true treasures. For more: Augie March are touring their debut record, Sunset Studies, in March, in celebration of its 20th anniversary. New album Bloodsport & Porn is out now.
Tame Impala – No Choice For fans of: Late Night Sessions, Phoenix, Ty Segall Recorded during the sessions for The Slow Rush and held back due to reasons of taste or timing, it’s not surprising that No Choice slots firmly into the album it was born of: another slice of space-R&B that finds Kevin Parker floating further still into the pop realm, now as much a student of Donna Summer as Donovan. With Parker’s favourite flange setting skipping across the entire track, and guitar solos so fuzzed out they resemble vuvuzelas, this is three-and-a-half minutes of smoked-out bliss. Detractors may point out this is more of the same; fans will love it for this very fact. For more: The Slow Rush deluxe edition is out 18 February. Georgia Maq – Joe Rogan For fans of: Robyn, Doja Cat, Camp Cope Since a very public romantic breakup (at least in indie rock circles), Camp Cope’s Georgia Maq has made no secret of her “historically bad taste”, as she puts it. The song Joe Rogan is not an ode to the divisive bobble-headed podcaster, but a slight on the specific types of men who hero-worship him: who lecture women during first dates; who are turned off by women with opinions; who mansplain perceived inadequacies via lengthy, angry text messages (one of which appears to be captured on the cover art to this single). Music-wise, this is sparkling synth-driven pop, much in the vein of Maq’s solo debut Pleaser, with a sharp message – “there is nothing more dangerous than a man who thinks consent is lame” – and a chorus of friends echoing Maq’s bad taste via a series of voice messages. It’s both fun and frightening. For more: Listen to 2021 single Someone Stranger, with Alice Ivy. Babe Rainbow – Smash the Machine For fans of: Treetops, Donovan, MGMT Babe Rainbow deal sun-drenched, lysergic-dripping psychedelia from the back of their touring VW bus, the type of music that casts a bloodshot eye back at the 1960s without ever slipping into parody or pastiche. Smash the Machine goes heavy on the flange and social commentary, bemoaning the ever-whirling machines that seem to be taking bigger bites out of our everyday lives. Like label mates King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, the Byron band are maddeningly prolific; this single follows four quick-fire quality albums. A little more whimsical than the tunes on last year’s Changing Colours, this is the perfect breath of wild sea air to inhale as you enter the new year. For more: Listen to Changing Colours, or 2019’s Today album. Alannah Russack – Places You Love
For fans of: The Hummingbirds, Jodi Phillis, Love Positions During the late 1980s, Sydney’s the Hummingbirds were part of a pre-grunge movement that saw acts like the Clouds, Ratcat and the Falling Joys brighten the corners of the country with gleeful pop music: breezy but punchy, developed in garages and small pubs. Vocalist Alannah Russack is still peeling off joyous tunes in the same vein, and fans of her familiar sound will instantly fall for Places You Love – the crystalline guitars, the immediate, effortless melody, and her clear, spirited lilt are all in full flight. Like many songs written in the past few years, this one is about perseverance in the face of adversity – with a hefty dose of nostalgia thrown in for good measure. For more: Russack’s album As Memories Pass Each Other will be out soon.
Blackbirds FC – Transport Planes For fans of: Flying Nun, the Church, late 80s the Saints Transport Planes is a song of liminal states, which drifts like a daydream transporting you back to the days of 1980s FM radio, with Jeremy Gronow’s voice a dead ringer for Steve Kilbey, a chorus that will stick in your brain for days, perfectly placed backing vocals, references to truckers and Tasmania and transport planes, all driven stick-shift by guitar tones so bright and sunny you need 15+ fluoro zinc to protect you (this is an 80s daydream, remember). For more: Listen to previous single, Island of the Dogs. Hoodoo Gurus – Carry On For fans of: The Sunnyboys, Cheap Trick, Redd Kross Sounding suspiciously vital after 40 years, Hoodoo Gurus’ latest single leaps from the speakers, an immediate power-pop anthem that joins a run of recent one-off singles which suggest that maybe Faulkner and co are gearing up for album number 10 – their first in 12 years. The calls for resilience in the chorus make for a fitting pandemic rallying cry, but this song was actually written pre-Covid (although annexed to a fitting video showing frontline workers struggling with the demands). Hoodoo Gurus are still one of this country’s most underrated gems. For more: Check out recent singles Get Out Of Dodge, and Hung Out to Dry.
Wilsn – You Know Better For fans of: Amy Winehouse, Gin Wigmore, Lanie Lane There’s no shortage of smoky vocalists who have cemented themselves in the post-Amy Winehouse neo soul world; students of Ella Fitzgerald, Etta James and Billie Holiday. Ivy League Records’ latest signee, Wilsn, stands above the pack with You Know Better, which sports a truly jaw-dropping vocal and one hell of a killer chorus, making for the type of rare tune that already sounds like a standard. Horn blasts and propulsion drums help set the mood, but it is the singular talent at the centre of things that makes this more than just another diet-Winehouse offering. For more: Wilsn plays 10 February at the Vanguard, Sydney and 19 February at Lulie Tavern, Melbourne. D Henry Fenton – Ruby (Days Gone By) For fans of: Weddings Parties Anything, Ryan Adams With a voice that has shades of Ryan Adams and Roy Orbison in its pure yearning magic, and a story about a heartbreaking custody disrupt, Ruby (Days Gone By) is both a simple, loving ode to a daughter not seen enough and a dark shot at an embittered ex-lover. The first strums sound unmistakably like To Her Door before the track breaks into its own emotive tale of fractured family life and a protagonist that cannot seem to get out of his own way.

5792;5792;Telehealth changes ‘devastating’ for psychiatry patients in regional areas;2022-01-03T16:30:06Z;['Tory Shepherd'];['Health', 'Australia news', 'Medicare Australia', 'Greg Hunt'];"Australians in regional areas with severe mental health problems will go without help, after “devastating” changes to the telehealth system, psychiatrists warn. Recent federal government reforms removed a 50% loading for some rural psychiatric services, meaning some types of consultations providers will no longer be able to bulk-bill. They will have to absorb the costs or pass them on to patients. • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Dr Vivienne James, a psychiatrist at Sydney’s Gordon Clinic, says she is “devastated” and her patients will be “distressed” about the changes, which came into effect on 1 January. “It is simply not financially viable for us to continue seeing these patients,” she said. “This will leave many patients distressed and, dare I say it, suicidal, as some of these people are extremely isolated and have little support. They will not be able to pay to see us and will have to be discharged back to their GPs. “Personally, I am devastated by these changes.” Grahame Gee, a credentialed mental health nurse, said it was “unethical” that he and his colleagues were “blindsided” by the changes, which were announced a couple of weeks before Christmas. His patients have complex mental health needs and many also have histories of physical and sexual abuse and intimate partner violence. “Most have limited financial means and struggle to pay gap fees,” he said. “Their recovery depends upon access to this service … I had patients in tears … Others said they would have to cancel their appointments.” On 13 December the federal health department announced $106m to make telehealth a permanent part of primary healthcare. On 16 December it announced changes to the Medical Benefits Scheme, including two new telehealth items, 17 amended items and the scrapping of 128 items, which included item 288 for video psychiatric consultations through GP referrals. Guardian Australia revealed how other changes would affect patients, particularly those with cancer.
Assoc Prof Vinay Lakra, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists president, said most of the reforms were welcome, but that fixing some gaps meant others appeared. “People living in a rural area couldn’t afford to see a psychiatrist, but [the rural loading] allowed them to see a psychiatrist without paying a gap. If you’re bulk-billing and that loading is removed, some providers will pass on the cost to the patients and patients might cancel their appointment.” The rural loading was introduced about 10 years ago to encourage the use of telehealth in country Australia, an incentive the health department says is no longer needed. Lakra said that before Covid, the psychiatric community wanted it phased out rather than removed and only phased out if there was another system in place to ensure affordability and accessibility. Covid “hasn’t gone”, he said, and the college wants the MBS item extended for another year. “Twelve months is enough time to prepare a plan … With item 288 there was not enough time,” he said. In a statement, the health department said the new arrangements consolidated telehealth into a single national program, “ensuring universal and equitable access”, and that rural patients will have access to other bulk-billing options.
The loading was to encourage the take-up of video consultations and help practitioners adopt new technologies. But according to the statement, there are about 10 times more telephone consultations than there are consultations that attract the loading and more than twice as many video consultations that do not attract the loading. “This is about improving access to video and telephone services provided by GPs, medical specialists and other health professionals that reflect clinical best practice and provides greater flexibility in the healthcare system, depending on the services required,” the statement said. “It is backed by an additional $106m over four years and part of a $308.6m investment by the government to support Australia’s primary care system.” • Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/telehealth-changes-devastating-for-psychiatry-patients-in-regional-areas
5793;5793;Can Britain really learn to live with Omicron? This week we’ll find out;2022-01-03T16:30:05Z;['Gaby Hinsliff'];['Coronavirus', 'Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Hospitals', 'Schools', 'Education', 'Politics', 'Society', 'UK news'];"The roulette wheel is spinning, the ball already rattling towards its final destination. Boris Johnson has bet the house on his Omicron gamble and now there’s no going back. The bullishness of ministers insisting over the weekend that they see no case for further restrictions glosses over the fact that it may now be too late for that anyway, given an estimated one in 25 people in England already had the virus before New Year’s Eve. Double or quits it is, then, as a country drags itself back out to work and school after the Christmas hibernation period. We’re about to find out exactly what it means to experience unprecedented levels of Covid infections, but from a strain that may be less dangerous, at least in the fully vaccinated. Once again, a virus we thought we’d got to know has abruptly shapeshifted and once again, history isn’t necessarily a reliable guide to the present. We’re all back on the seesaw, lurching between hope and fear, never knowing quite what to expect. The novel threat this time is not death on the biblical scale forecast during the first wave – although sadly there will be too many deaths, hospitalisations and cases of long Covid disabling people for months to come – but knock-on chaos and disruption caused by the potential mass infection of key workers, leaving them unable to do their work. We’ve entered an unpredictable world of people who have heart attacks waiting for well over an hour for an ambulance, critical incidents being declared by hospitals that can’t maintain safe staffing levels and large organisations being warned to plan for up to a quarter of their people being off sick or self-isolating. Now imagine what that worst-case scenario might do to the everyday grind of supermarket deliveries, bin collections and bus timetables, let alone to policing or critical infrastructure such as the power and water industries. Education ministers have meanwhile vowed to keep schools and nurseries open wherever possible – rightly given the profound impact we now know closures had on poorer children’s education, and on a vulnerable few who are sadly safer with their teachers than with their parents – but are simultaneously letting heads know they can send year groups home if they have to. For secondary schools in England and Wales hit by serious staff shortages, in practice that would probably mean prioritising GCSE and A-level classes for pupils who need to sit their mocks this term but switching to home schooling for other years if necessary, something already happening in some parts of the country before Christmas as Omicron hit. Nurseries and primary schools catering for pupils too young to be vaccinated will meanwhile be flinging windows open to the January air and crossing their fingers, knowing that (at least according to the Office for National Statistics) about one in 15 children aged between two and 11 had Covid before Christmas. Since many key workers are also parents who can’t easily do their jobs if their child gets sent home sick, we’re probably about to be reminded that childcare is the fourth emergency service, without which the other three would struggle very quickly. In other words, it’s time to prepare ourselves at least for the possibility of things getting messy; of everyday life becoming harder and more volatile as Covid jams its spokes into wheels that in good times you barely even notice turning.
With luck, that upheaval could be mercifully brief. But any country that nearly ground to a halt overnight thanks to a temporary post-Brexit shortage of fuel tanker drivers and a panicky stampede for petrol should probably have learned by now not to get cocky. Over and over again this virus has reminded us of just how much happens unseen beneath the surface of a functioning society; of how complex our just-in-time modern lives with all their endlessly interconnected moving parts have become, but also how fragile, dependent on things and people we mostly take for granted until brutally reminded not to do so. And that’s why learning to live with this or any other virus, the mantra of those who never want their liberties restricted by government diktat again, doesn’t mean quite what some hope it does. It’s not about ripping off your mask and gleefully forgetting that any of it ever happened, but about building in resilience and learning from the weaknesses exposed by Covid. Rubbing along successfully through what might hopefully be the tail end of a pandemic should mean investing not just in vaccines and antivirals but in more hospital beds and people to staff them, creating enough slack in the system to absorb seasonal Covid surges without having to throw up tent wards in NHS car parks. It’s going to mean well-honed contingency plans for critical industries, better ventilation in schools, and more imaginative answers to the question of protecting people who are shielding or clinically vulnerable than are so far forthcoming from lockdown sceptics bellowing that it’s time everyone was left to get on with their lives. But it may also take something of a shift in national attitudes. Living successfully with Covid-19 will require not just a virus obliging enough not to mutate in more lethal ways but the maturity to self-police sometimes – as plenty did last month by voluntarily side-swerving parties or the pub so they could have Christmas with their families, and as Swedes have always quietly done in what was the unsung element of their country’s no-lockdown policy – and the resilience to live with a degree of unpredictability in life, which is infinitely easier said than done for some. Low-income families especially are likely to need help absorbing the sudden shocks and disruptions this virus is still capable of delivering, even as it hopefully burns itself out. The silver lining to the Omicron cloud is, of course, that it could pass relatively quickly. It’s risky reading too much into data collected over the Christmas holidays when reporting was potentially patchy, but all hopes are now pinned on Britain following the same path as South Africa, where infections seemed to peak relatively quickly before falling back. A rocky few weeks, so the cabinet’s argument goes, beats months of economic and personal misery; better to rip the plaster off and get it over with. Whether that gamble was uncharacteristically shrewd or lethally reckless will become clear enough in the next few days as Omicron spreads from London to the rest of the UK, with hospitalisation rates doubling already across much of the north of England. But right now, the wretched roulette wheel is still spinning, and all most of us can do about it is hold our breath.

5794;5794;‘My heart sank’: Covid returns to Newmarch House as aged care sector fears new crisis;2022-01-03T16:30:05Z;['Royce Kurmelovs', 'Michael McGowan'];['Aged care', 'Coronavirus', 'Australia news', 'Royal commission into aged care quality and safety', 'New South Wales'];"A positive Covid case has been recorded at the Newmarch House aged care home in Sydney, where 19 people died during an outbreak in 2020, amid growing concern at the strain on the sector’s workforce. As of Monday, there were 1,180 active Covid-19 cases in aged care homes across Australia, with more than 550 each in New South Wales and Victoria. In the past seven days, the NSW health department has reported the deaths of eight aged care home residents as a result of coronavirus infections acquired inside the facilities. Federal government data suggests a rise in deaths in aged care has coincided with the move by most states to relax restrictions. In 2021 91 people died with Covid in aged care across Australia up to 22 October. By 17 December that figure had more than doubled to 206. At the same time the workforce in NSW, which has experienced record-breaking case numbers, has come under increasing pressure.
The Guardian spoke to three aged care workers in the state, all of whom did not wish to be named out of concern for their employment situation. Those in metropolitan areas described a feeling of “desperation” and burnout, with workers in some facilities pulling 16-hour shifts to cover gaps in the workforce and nearby hospitals refusing to take new Covid-positive patients unless “absolutely necessary”. One worker at a regional facility in the state’s north said six staff had quit due to low pay and burnout, leaving them woefully unprepared in the event of an outbreak. “I think we’re going to get Covid in the facility,” they said. “I think we’re going to lose more staff. I think the current staff who are willing to stay are going to burn out and get sick themselves. I think we’re going into a state of disaster. People will die.” On Sunday the operator of Newmarch, Anglicare, notified residents’ families that a staff member had tested positive for the virus after a “community exposure”. Newmarch said another member of staff and a resident had been identified as close contacts, but that no further positive cases had been identified as yet. “Our highest priority is the safety and wellbeing of residents and staff, while providing the best possible care to residents in the home,” Newmarch said in its email to the families. “As a further precaution, PCR testing of [the] staff and residents will take place today.” The case has put the families of residents on high alert, prompting memories of the devastating outbreak in which 37 residents tested positive and 19 died after a staff member worked a shift while infectious in April 2020. At the time it was the deadliest outbreak of the pandemic in Australia. “My heart sank, it really did,” Elizabeth Lane, whose mother is a resident at Newmarch, told the Guardian. “My mum is at the end of life and the idea that there could be another outbreak and I wouldn’t be able to see her or be with her if she passed away, nothing would break my heart more.
“I don’t know if people realise the impact of what happened on the residents there, the decline in a lot of the older people. Because of the lockdown and everything that has happened, you go in there and the atmosphere is just so quiet.” Gerard Hayes, the national president of the Health Services Union, said he believed the situation was going to get “dramatically worse” around the country over the next few weeks. “I would usually have an optimistic view that if we apply this or apply that, we can manage through. I don’t have an answer this time,” Hayes said. “This problem manifested itself some time ago [and] we chose to do very little about it. “Both the government and opposition have been talking a big game on aged care until it’s come to now. What are [the] Labor and Liberal [parties] going to do for the people who actually built this country, who put us in a position we are in today? “I need answers – from both sides of government. At the moment all I’m hearing about in the federal sphere is nuclear submarines and bullet trains.” Hayes said the low pay in the industry, with a base rate of $23 an hour, was not enough to attract and keep new workers under normal conditions, let alone during a time of crisis. Paul Sadler, the chief executive of Aged and Community Services Australia, said pay was one of a number of issues that had not been addressed since the royal commission and the first wave of the pandemic. “What we are seeing now is federal and state governments warning all businesses they could be losing 10 to 25% of their staff, to a period of time when they’re Covid-positive and can’t come into work,” Sadler said. “I think our members feel like it’s an impossible situation on a daily basis for the moment. They’re trying to balance the risk; they’re trying to enable residents to have the best life possible; they’re trying to keep out a deadly disease; they’re trying to manage staff rosters when there’s immense pressure on the availability of staff.” “It’s the toughest time aged care services have ever been through.” • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
A spokesperson for the federal health department said it was working closely with states and territories to provide surge workforce support when needed. “As soon as the department is notified of a case in an aged care worker or resident, a case manager will be appointed to support the facility,” the spokesperson said. “This includes facilitating access to commonwealth programs and supports such as PPE and surge workforce. “In addition, surge workforce support continues to be provided to supplement aged care providers’ strategies. This includes access to dedicated nursing staff and support from agency workers, as well as agreements with private hospitals to provide support if states seek to utilise this resource.” The federal government changed guidelines on Saturday to allow employees who are close contacts to return to work earlier from isolation where a lack of staff was having a “high impact” on services. A national cabinet meeting on Wednesday is expected to address the issue of staffing in aged care.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/04/my-heart-sank-covid-returns-to-newmarch-house-as-aged-care-sector-fears-new-crisis

“The religious discrimination bill will encourage prejudice, stigma, denigration, division, and discrimination against people with disability, and undermine all efforts to build and sustain an inclusive Australia.” The organisations – which include peak advocacy groups People With Disability Australia and the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations – raise particular concern about the bill’s controversial statement of belief clause. This part of the proposed legislation says “statements of belief” do not breach discrimination laws, giving legal protection to statements of religious belief or “a belief that the person genuinely considers to relate to the fact of not holding a religious belief”. Examples given in the submission include a person with a disability being told they are suffering a “punishment from God” for their, or their parents’, sins. Or being told they may be “healed” by prayer or by “living virtuously”. Disability advocates say this clause, which would override existing state legislation aimed at protecting people with disability, will result in more discrimination. It warns that a “power imbalance” already exists between people with a disability and the large proportion of disability support services that are faith-based and control the delivery of personal care, housing, community access and emergency relief. “We are concerned the religious discrimination bill will allow people with disability to be demeaned by statements of religious belief that are permitted under this bill, creating an unsafe and harmful environment,” it states. A separate submission from Disability Voices Tasmania says the proposed bill, which was first promised in 2018 and is now in its third iteration, “introduces the right to discriminate in the name of religion”. “People with disability constantly experience ridicule, offensive assumptions, bias, and intimidation. It does not matter whether this arises from hate, prejudice, misguided assumptions, and attitudes towards disability, or because of religious belief – or one person’s interpretation of religious belief,” the group’s chair, Michael Small, said. “What matters is the hurt, humiliation, and long-term impact we experience as a result of it.” Small said the legislation would override the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Act which prohibits conduct that a reasonable person would anticipate would offend, humiliate, intimidate, insult, or ridicule another person on the basis of disability. The proposed overriding of state and territory anti-discrimination laws has also been criticised by equality advocates, who fear protections for the LGBTQ+ community would also be undermined, including state laws banning conversion practices.
The Equality Australia chief executive, Anna Brown, told federal parliament’s human rights committee in December that the proposal to override state laws would weaken equal rights. “It’s anathema to our democracy that state laws could be overridden in this way and that these hard-fought-for protections that have existed for decades, in many cases, could be unwound and overridden and undermined by this bill.” The proposed legislation is being scrutinised by two parliamentary inquiries due to report by 4 February – shortly before the scheduled resumption of parliament. The government was unable to pass the legislation in the final sitting of 2021 given deep divisions within the Coalition party room over the bill. Labor is reserving its position on the legislation until the inquiries are completed. But the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has said any new religious discrimination laws should not come at “the expense of discriminating on the basis of other people’s characteristics”.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/03/coalitions-religious-discrimination-bill-will-erode-rights-of-people-with-disability-advocates-say
5796;5796;Covid-positive nurses are working in NSW hospitals due to severe staffing shortages;2022-01-03T16:30:05Z;['Elias Visontay'];['Health', 'New South Wales', 'Sydney', 'Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'Australia news'];"Covid-positive nurses are being recalled to work in hospitals across New South Wales – in breach of state health protocols – as hospital managers resort to desperate measures to staff facilities buckling under the Omicron outbreak. Guardian Australia has been contacted by multiple nurses working across several hospitals in the state who are alarmed at finding themselves working alongside Covid-positive colleagues, as 2,500 health workers are in isolation across NSW. The public hospitals span three local health districts in NSW and include major Sydney hospitals and smaller regional facilities.
All of the nurses say they had received unofficial, verbal advice from their hospitals in recent days that Covid-positive nurses could leave their mandated isolation to work, provided they were asymptomatic and wore personal protective equipment. However, some claimed they saw Covid-positive nurses on wards with obvious symptoms, including coughing and sneezing. At one Sydney hospital, the Covid-positive nurses appeared to be limited to working in Covid wards. However, at other hospitals, nurses said they were treating non-Covid patients and interacting with Covid-negative staff. “God help any non-Covid patient in a hospital right now. They are sitting ducks,” one nurse told Guardian Australia. “It’s like everyone has given up. I’m absolutely devastated. It’s a circus … positive nurses working with healthy staff and non-Covid patients.” Protocols for healthcare workers in NSW have been loosened in recent days, including an exemption announced on New Year’s Eve to allow workers who are close contacts that should be isolating for seven days, to return to work if they are asymptomatic and deemed essential by their employer. However, a NSW Health spokesperson confirmed that Covid-positive nurses do not fall under this exemption. “Healthcare workers in NSW who test positive to Covid-19 are required to isolate at home and are not permitted to return to work until they are released from isolation,” they said. Nurses who expressed concern about allowing Covid-positive colleagues to return to work stressed that the advice was given in an unofficial capacity, as managers were left with few other options to ensure patients could be cared for. The nurses requested their names and employers remain confidential to avoid identifying them. The revelation comes days after Guardian Australia obtained a leaked memo that revealed critically understaffed public hospitals in NSW were planning to fly in nurses from overseas. Desperate attempts also included managers begging local staff to cancel leave and offering $250 daily incentives on top of public holiday penalties. Meanwhile, the western NSW LHD is offering nurses $823 a week on top of their wage to work in the region during January. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, has said the health system “remains strong”, and his health minister, Brad Hazzard, has also defended the system. On Monday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, backed up these comments, insisting Australia’s health system could manage the “very different virus” of the Omicron variant. However, the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association general secretary, Brett Holmes, accused governments of presenting an overly optimistic version of the state of the health system.
Holmes said reports of Covid-positive nurses returning to work “shows the level of desperation we’ve got into our health system”. “To try and force potential sick and infectious staff into the hospitals to work, that places everyone at risk.” Holmes told Guardian Australia he was “absolutely opposed” to allowing Covid-positive nurses to return to work before finishing their isolation and testing negative – but noted such a policy had occurred in parts of Europe and the United States during the peaks of their outbreaks. “There has been discussion about this here, because it’s been done overseas, and talk of the idea is no doubt rife amongst desperate managers looking for staff. They might well be preparing for this,” Holmes said. Holmes added the practice risked spreading Covid to vulnerable patients in hospital for unrelated reasons. “We know these types of patients can die with Covid. If nurses [are] knowingly being told to go in there and play a bit of Russian roulette as to whether their PPE is perfect all the time, it’s an extraordinary expectation to work in those circumstances,” Holmes said.

5797;5797;Antonio Conte insists he has nothing to prove on Chelsea return with Spurs;2022-01-03T16:24:48Z;['David Hytner'];['Tottenham Hotspur', 'Antonio Conte', 'Chelsea', 'Carabao Cup', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Antonio Conte says he has nothing to prove to anyone at Chelsea as he prepares for a first return to Stamford Bridge since his sacking in 2018. The manager goes back with Tottenham on Wednesday night for the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg and it is sure to be emotional, given the relationships he made during his two seasons in west London.
Conte won the Premier League in his first campaign, seeing off the challenge of Spurs – then managed by Mauricio Pochettino – and he followed it up with an FA Cup triumph in his second season, his team beating Manchester United in the final. It was not enough, however, to earn him a longer stay. Conte’s focus is on the cup game and managing a return of Covid cases to his squad. After the large outbreak in December that led to Spurs being forced to postpone their Europa Conference League tie against Rennes and the league fixture at Brighton, Conte said the club were “checking a couple of situations about Covid” with regard to players, although he was “not sure 100% that they’re going to miss the game”. Yet Conte did acknowledge the romantic side of the story that pits him against the club that gave him his first opportunity to work in England. “I spent two seasons where I created a good relationship with players, staff, people who work at Chelsea,” Conte said. “We did a really good job and I think in my position I mustn’t prove anything to anyone. I’m a manager that has experience and continues to have experience and do important jobs at other teams. It’ll be a pleasure for me to come back to Stamford Bridge.” Conte is acutely aware that Spurs have won nothing since 2008 but he also knows that Chelsea are at a different stage of development. “At this moment, Chelsea is more ready than us to win,” he said. “They won the Champions League last season. We have a lot of space for improvement, to be a team with aspirations to win. To use the verb ‘to win’ is more simple than winning because to win you have to build something important, be solid, have an important squad. Then you’re ready to win. Otherwise you have to hope.”
On the disruption of Covid cases, Conte said: “We are living with this situation – not only Tottenham but all the clubs. We have to be ready to find always the right solutions. For sure it’s not simple for any coach to change the plan you have, especially when you play many games in a short time. You make a plan in your mind and sometimes you arrive and players are positive so you have to totally change your plan.” Meanwhile, the Premier League confirmed that between 27 December and 2 January, there were 94 new positive cases of Covid-19. This figure, which came from 14,250 tests, includes players and staff from the 20 clubs. It was the first week-by-week decrease in positive results for eight weeks.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/antonio-conte-nothing-to-prove-chelsea-return-with-spurs-carabao-cup-covid-cases
5798;5798;Death toll of refugees attempting to reach Spain doubles in 2021;2022-01-03T16:09:22Z;['Ashifa Kassam'];['Migration', 'World news', 'Spain', 'Europe'];An estimated 12 people a day died or disappeared while trying to reach Spain in 2021, more than double the total for the previous year. The 4,404 refugees who perished included 205 children, according to Caminando Fronteras (Walking Borders). In a report published on Monday, the NGO noted that the number of deaths was more than twice the 2,170 deaths and disappearances recorded in 2020. “It’s horrible,” said Helena Maleno, who leads Caminando Fronteras. “These are the worst figures we’ve seen since we began keeping count in 2007.” The report drew a direct link between the steep rise in the number of deaths and European efforts to curb migration in the Mediterranean. As a result, refugees have turned increasingly to the treacherous Canary Islands route – one of the most dangerous crossings into Europe – setting off in unstable vessels that are often unfit to face the fierce currents of the Atlantic. Up until 28 December last year, 22,200 migrants landed on the shores of the Canary Islands, according to the Spanish government. Caminando Fronteras estimated that 4,016 people died or vanished along the route, suggesting that for approximately every six people who make it to the Spanish archipelago, one person dies or disappears. The figures compiled by Caminando Fronteras are drawn from the work it does in fielding distress calls from migrants or their families and alerting coastguards and maritime rescue services. The NGO also logs missing vessels and works with relatives to identify the missing and the dead. “The 4,404 is the minimum number,” said Maleno. “The truth is that there could be more victims that we aren’t aware of.” Boats en route to Spain often vanish without a trace, in part explaining why the bodies of 95% of those who died or disappear are never recovered. People who were lost attempting to reach Spain came from 21 countries, from the Ivory Coast to Sri Lanka, many fleeing armed conflict or the consequences of climate change. Those who do make it to Spain, particularly via the Canary Islands route, are often haunted by the journey. “The waves were taller than the dinghy,” one survivor told Caminando Fronteras after a voyage in which 15 of the 58 people onboard were lost. “The waves washed people away, sweeping them off the boat,” they said. Another man from Mali described spending days lost at sea as food and water supplies dwindled and nearly all of the 59 people onboard succumbed to starvation. After 19 days adrift, rescuers found him and two others barely alive. He had spent much of the trip force-feeding a young boy who also managed to survive. “I would open his mouth to feed him a scrap of biscuit with the bit of water that was left and tell him to swallow,” he said. “He looked dead.” On Monday, Caminando Fronteras called on the Spanish government to take urgent steps to address the rise in deaths, noting that more than three decades had passed since a body turned up on the shores of Andalusia, in what is believed to be the first known death of a Spain-bound refugee. “In those 34 years, the idea that people can die by crossing a border has become something that people have accepted as normal,” said Maleno. “It’s not normal.” The International Organization for Migration has described 2021 as the deadliest for migration routes to and within Europe since 2018. At least 1,315 people have died on the central Mediterranean crossing, while at least 41 lives were lost at the land border between Turkey and Greece. In November, 27 refugees, including a pregnant woman and three children, drowned in the Channel while trying to cross from France to the UK.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/death-toll-of-refugees-attempting-to-reach-spain-doubles-in-2021
5799;5799;Wild birds can be killed to protect game birds in England – new guidance;2022-01-03T16:07:29Z;['Helena Horton'];['Birds', 'Conservation', 'Hunting', 'Animals', 'Environment', 'Rural affairs', 'England', 'UK news', 'Wildlife'];"Some wild birds can be killed in order to protect game birds bred for shooting in England, the government has ruled, in an update to guidance on general shooting licences. General licences give broad permissions to shoot certain species of wild birds to protect livestock, aid conservation, and preserve health and public safety. The new licences have been issued for two years rather than one, with government officials saying this is to provide “stability and certainty” to shooters. General licences are permissive licences, meaning users do not need to apply for them but they must comply with their terms and conditions when undertaking licensed acts. There has been debate over whether pheasants, partridges and grouse count as livestock, as they are wild birds, and so whether predators can be shot in order to protect them. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has released a new definition of “livestock” including these birds, to give explicit permission to shoot carrion crows, jackdaws, magpies and rooks. It reads: “‘Livestock’ is as defined in section 27(1) of the 1981 [Wildlife and Countryside] Act. For the purpose of this licence, this expression also includes game birds kept in an enclosure or which are free roaming but remain significantly dependent on the provision of food, water or shelter by a keeper for their survival. This does not include supplementary feeding.” A Defra spokesperson said the change was made after gamekeepers asked for more clarity about whether game birds counted as livestock. The new language makes it clear that wild predatory birds cannot be shot under this licence in order to protect wild game birds that are not dependent on food and shelter from humans, but they can be shot under the licence if they are. The official added: “The new general licences have been updated to clarify when they apply and make clear when a game bird ceases to be livestock and becomes a wild bird. None of the changes alter the activities licence users are authorised to do. “We continue to work with stakeholders to ensure our licensing process is robust for wildlife and workable for users going forward.” Conservation groups raised concerns that the update could mean an increase in the killing of wild birds. The RSPB’s head of site conservation policy, Kate Jennings, said: “If this update to the livestock general licence goes beyond a reclassification of terminology and implies that it will lead to an increase in the killing of wild birds to protect game bird interests, then given the nature and climate emergency we find ourselves in, this would be a massive backward step for nature conservation in this country.” The general licences have been challenged by wildlife groups including the BBC presenter Chris Packham’s Wild Justice. His group has challenged the legislation and in 2019 managed to get it suspended. Wild Justice has since managed to secure changes including removing all gull species, and the places they can be used no longer include sites of special scientific interest and other nature reserves. • This article was amended on 4 January 2022. The headline of an earlier version inaccurately said the law had been changed; it is the guidance on licences that has changed by introducing a new definition of “livestock”. The sub-heading and introduction was also amended to clarify this.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/03/law-change-allows-wild-birds-killed-protect-game-birds-england
5800;5800;Back to black: goths go mainstream in corsets, leather and lace;2022-01-03T16:00:04Z;['Rachel Hall'];['Fashion', 'Culture', 'Life and style', 'Fashion industry'];"It’s been 20 years since pallid faces, dark eyes and black clothes haunted UK secondary schools and shopping centres. While some might argue that they never left, merely retreating into the shadows, the consensus for 2022 is that goth style is returning to mainstream culture with a vengeance. There are some differences this time. The modern goth is more likely to take inspiration from ultra-glam “hot goth girlfriends” such as Kourtney Kardashian and Megan Fox and the fashion world darlings Rick Owens and Yohji Yamamoto than the Marilyn Manson-loving self-proclaimed outsiders of the early 2000s. They are also more likely to integrate elements of a darker style of dressing into their wardrobes than to subscribe to a whole culture and lifestyle, with shopping platforms and social media sites reporting huge increases in searches containing the word “goth”.
“At one point there was an idea goth was ‘strange and unusual’, but it doesn’t feel that way any more. I wouldn’t like to say it’s mainstream, but it’s much more visible,” said Catherine Spooner, a professor at Lancaster University who specialises in gothic culture. Andrew Groves, professor of fashion design at the University of Westminster, sees the new goth style as a reaction to the preening, gym-honed, Instagram-filtered perfection of the 2010s. “It has become unappealing. Instead, smudged eyeliner, bitten oxblood lips, and a deathly pallor have once again become enticing.” He said it’s unsurprising that people are looking for ways to express darker emotions aesthetically when “we have been overwhelmed with news about death, mortality, and illness” since the beginning of the pandemic, while school closures have lent themselves to a mood of “romantic disengagement, sullenness, and introspection” among teens.
The clothing resale app Depop, which is popular with Gen Z consumers, reported a 20% increase in “goth” and “gothcore” searches over the past three months, including a 200% spike for “black corset top” in October. Sophie Daly, who runs a goth clothing business on Depop, said the new approach to goth style is to mix and match influences as online communities have connected previously disparate tribes, united by a love for sombre palettes and dark thoughts. She said: “Visually a goth could literally be anything now. In 2022, goths don’t even have to wear black.” She said videos on TikTok, such as those under the #goth hashtag, which has 8.8bn views, are fuelling the interest in vintage goth fashion, with some sellers auctioning pieces for up to £350 due to high demand. The shopping platform Lyst said searches for collections by the cult goth designer Rick Owens, which feature black leather and punk details such as rips and zips, have grown by 200% this year. Searches for black items have grown 169%, while chokers have grown by 81% and fishnet tops by 196%. Pinterest data, meanwhile, points to the goth aesthetic influencing everyday life. Searches for “goth business casual”, described as “Wednesday Addams goes to the office”, are up by 90% this year, with goth baby clothes up 120%, goth decor by 85%, and searches for goth pyjamas up 185%. This is echoed in the online communities building around the topic. On Reddit, the r/Goth community has grown by 35% over the past year to reach 101,000 members, while r/GothStyle had a 136% increase to 115,000 members. The focus this time around has been on personal style and the way it has inspired and been lifted from high fashion, with cyber goths haunting the runway in Balenciaga’s spring-summer 2022 show, Givenchy showcasing 90s teen goths, and Olivier Theyskens taking inspiration from gothic brides.
There is also a goth influence on culture more broadly. Taylor Swift’s latest album references folk horror, Willow Smith has a subversive new look, and the 18-year-old singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo, who sports a “goth princess” aesthetic, references the goth-adjacent emo subculture of the mid-2000s in her songs. Daniel Rodgers, a fashion and culture writer, said the new goth aesthetic taps into the early noughties revival that has defined youth fashion and culture in recent years. It’s not a return of the “deathly looking goth”, he said, but rather a way to “gesture at subculture more generally” by drawing on a blend of earlier dark style tribes, including emo, punk and strands of goth such as the Camden-inspired cyber-goth look. Rodgers charts the current moment from the eboys and egirls phenomenon of the late 2010s, where young gamers popularised a style that combined elements of goth and emo with Japanese anime and cosplay. He sees this and the current iteration of goth as reflecting the way culture develops in the internet. “We’re in a constant cycle of looking back and reproducing things, spewing up references on to the table, which is like a buffet young people can choose from.”";https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/03/back-to-black-goths-go-mainstream-in-corsets-leather-and-lace
5801;5801;Doomscrolling: the exhibition that visualises our appetite for bad news;2022-01-03T15:30:11Z;['David Smith'];['Art', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'Painting'];"When then US president Donald Trump caught the coronavirus, Zorawar Sidhu found himself refreshing his phone for updates. Waiting anxiously for the 2020 presidential election result, he was glued to flashing screen again. “My appetite for news had been increased,” the 36-year-old says by phone from New York. “Maybe it’s the frequency of it or the pace of how the information comes in or just how intense every morsel of information is, where the next thing is more alarming than the previous.”
We are all doomscrollers now, compulsively absorbing a constant flow of negative news with untold psychological and social consequences. Sidhu and fellow artist Rob Swainston, who marry historic printing processes with 21st century tools, have responded with works designed to make us stop and regain our footing. Their exhibition of woodblock prints, Doomscrolling, interprets 18 moments between 24 May 2020 and 6 January 2021, a stretch for the history books that saw the coronavirus pandemic, Black Lives Matter protests and deadly insurrection at the US Capitol. The project was born after Sidhu and Swainston found themselves bombarded by images from 2020 and after Swainston took photos of an eerily deserted Manhattan under quarantine during morning bike rides.
“It was a very strange sight and everything was empty and all you really saw was this very visible homeless population but everyone else was sort of hiding,” the 51-year-old recalls. “Then, all of a sudden, this plywood started to go up all over lower Manhattan in response to the protests. “I was photographing and I was like, wow, this is such an opportunity for someone who works in print media, and knows the potential of woodblock prints, to get this plywood somehow and use it to tell the story of 2020 on plywood that was put up to ‘protect institutions’. It just seemed so poetic.” The artists contacted various institutions asking if they could have the plywood when it came down and got several positive responses, particularly from the art world. Eventually they collected around 120 sheets. It proved the perfect means of expression, in part because woodblock prints have an association with social change movements going back at least 500 years, in part because the distressed, beaten up material could convey an inherently messy story. Sidhu explains: “In this case, woodcut was the appropriate medium because these prints are made with the paper directly touching the wood, which was outside during these protests and collecting graffiti and was scratched and gouged and drilled into and weathered. All this is still visible when you look up close at those prints.” To create a montage effect, the artists overlaid image upon image, as if scrolling through a computer screen or mobile phone. Sidhu and Swainston used art historical references such as a horse taken from Albrecht Dürer’s The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, hands from Käthe Kollwitz and heavy shadows from Edvard Munch.
The 18 prints each represent a specific image or event, including a 24 May New York Times front page “US DEATHS NEAR 100,000, AN INCALCULABLE LOSS” and, a day later, the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which sparked daily demonstrations against racial injustice in New York and other cities. Swainston, who has an academic background in both art and political science, recalls: “There were images that just circulated and circulated and there were some that in New York City circulated a lot among us and our friends. “I participated in some of the protests that went daily from Prospect Park to McCarren Park in Williamsburg. When the curfew happened, the police started to be aggressive to anyone who was out on the street after seven o’clock and lots of images were passed around. He continues: “Some of these events were very clear that we wanted to do something with, like the day in DC that the parks police gassed everybody and Trump went out and held up the Bible in front of St John’s Church. “There are some other dates that were harder: OK, how do we talk about Covid? Do we look at the dates that have the largest death day? Some of them were a little more nebulous as to what the exact date was but they were feelings that were happening in the time. Social distancing, hospitalisations, memorial images that we just wanted to bring into the series to tell the whole story.” One print focuses on Kyle Rittenhouse, who was 17 when, armed with an AR-style semiautomatic rifle, he shot and killed two people and wounded a third at a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In court, Rittenhouse argued that he fired in self-defence and was acquitted on all charges. But the first piece they finished was the last in chronological order: the storming of the US Capitol in Washington by a pro-Trump mob intent on overturning the election result on 6 January. It felt like a natural bookend. Sidhu explains: “There was an urgency in that moment of January 6 so we all felt that it was time to actually do something about it. For us, as artists, that first thing that we could do was to take that imagery and just get it out, try to do something with it.”
Many people, including doomscrolllers, have felt overwhelmed by the past two years. The artists hope to disrupt the idea of these moments as fixed and inevitable. Instead, they argue, their montages keep the moments alive with unfixed meanings, a clue that dialogue and social change are still possible. Sidhu, who was born in Ludhiana, India, says: “It encourages a re-examination of everything that’s happened rather than moving on as if these issues are resolved. We see Covid coming back with Omicron. With the show opening on January 6, it’s already an opportunity to reflect on that date and everything that comes with it.” Swainston adds: “We hope that, by putting it out there, by keeping the images in circulation, they continue to have possibility and don’t just become fixed in the past and we just move on from it. We are still in this moment in my mind and these culture wars that are brewing in the United States that threaten to pull us all apart. “These unresolved issues of race, of gun violence, all of these things we can’t put them behind us and just keep living in them. We need to start to address them and, in our society, it is through images that we are processing information now in a more and more significant way.” The departure of Trump from the White House, and his removal from Twitter, seemed to invite a little less doomscrolling in 2021, but persistent crises including the Omicron variant suggest the phenomenon will not be going away soon. Still, Swainston hopes the exhibition, which opens at the Petzel Gallery on New York’s upper east side on 6 January, can help to wean visitors off their fast food media diet. “We talk about the way that the media environments now are set up to reinforce what you’ve already seen but the way it’s happening is that images get thrown at you and they stack on top of each other, and the next one resonates with the next one. We become very fast in our reading of image; we understand right away. “This is a relatively new thing. The way that humans looked at images in previous environments, they were slower. We would take a long time with a painting or a photo or we would see the pieces first and then the whole. It just has consequences in the way that we look at images.” He adds: “We hope that this series slows people down. This is what you see, but as you’re looking, more and more unfolds, more and more is there, and it gives space for the viewer to continue to look and discover and make up their own mind about what these mean.” Doomscrolling opens on 6 January at the Petzel Gallery in New York";https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/03/doomscrolling-exhibition-covid-pandemic-new-york
5802;5802;‘Barça are back!’ Laporta insists club can compete for star names as Torres arrives;2022-01-03T15:23:33Z;['Guardian sport'];['Barcelona', 'La Liga', 'Transfer window', 'European club football', 'Football', 'Sport'];"The Barcelona president, Joan Laporta, has insisted that the club are “back as big players” in the transfer market after Ferran Torres was unveiled at Camp Nou. When asked if Barça were interested in signing the Dortmund striker Erling Haaland despite the club’s financial problems, Laporta replied: “We’re working to build a top team. Everything is possible if we do things well, and I’m sure we will. Top players are open to joining Barça.
“We’re definitely recovering our status. Everybody in the world should get ready, as we are back as big players in the market.” The club president also praised Torres, who has joined from Manchester City, with Barcelona securing a bank loan to help fund the Spain forward’s €55m (£46m) move. Laporta said: “We knew about Ferran’s situation and we were very pleased that he wanted to come to Barça so much. He is a great player.” The club’s director of football, Mateu Alemany, brushed off concerns about completing the formalities of the transfer. “The truth of the situation is that when we signed Torres, we knew we did not have room in terms of salaries,” Alemany said. “However, we have been making moves in different areas and we are convinced we can register him.” Torres was presented as a Barcelona player after signing a five-and-a-half-year deal with a €1bn buyout clause. The 21-year-old said he was attracted by the “challenge” of returning the club to the top of European football.
“I am facing this challenge with ambition, humility and a lot of desire,” Torres said. “This is a dream. I had the idea of coming back to La Liga and Barça showed an interest. I want to take Barça back to where it belongs. “Having played for two coaches with Barcelona roots, like Luis Enrique and Pep Guardiola, has helped me to adapt to the Barca DNA.” Torres spent 16 months at the Etihad Stadium after joining City from Valencia for an initial fee of £20.8m in the summer of 2020, scoring 16 goals in 43 appearances in all competitions.

5803;5803;Croydon stabbing: boy, 15, charged with murder of Zaian Aimable-Lina;2022-01-03T15:19:56Z;['Kevin Rawlinson'];['UK news'];"A teenager has been charged with the murder of 15-year-old Zaian Aimable-Lina, one of two boys to be killed within about an hour of each other in separate stabbing incidents in London on Thursday evening. The suspect, who is also aged 15 and whom police have not named because of his age, was arrested on Saturday and is due to appear at Bromley magistrates court in south London on Tuesday. Another 15-year-old has been released under investigation after being arrested on suspicion of murder on Friday. He has been bailed until late January, police said. A postmortem gave the cause of Zaian’s death as a stab wound to the heart.
A vigil was held over the weekend at Ashburton Park in Croydon, where the stabbing took place. Dozens of people gathered at a gate leading into the park on Saturday evening. Candles were lit and people consoled each other following the latest tragedy in the capital. There was also an increased police presence, with officers patrolling up and down the road adjacent to the park. The second teenager stabbed to death on Thursday evening, a 16-year-old boy in Yiewsley, west London, has yet to be named. A 16-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of his murder on Sunday. The two incidents made last year the deadliest on record in terms of homicides of teenagers. The 30 recorded in 2021 surpassed the 29 in 2008 – the previous worst toll. As the news emerged, campaigners said efforts to tackle knife crime had been inadequate and it was now so prevalent that it was becoming normalised. “Knife crime is accepted by this generation as part-and-parcel of growing up and that’s completely unacceptable,” said Patrick Green, the chief executive of the anti-knife crime charity the Ben Kinsella Trust, which was set up in 2008 after the fatal stabbing of 16-year-old Ben in north London. “It shows that not enough has been done and, if I’m being really critical, then I’d say the approach to tackling it has been scattergun. We have to sustain our response to knife crime, it has to be over the long term and not just one- and two-year funding for projects. It is a societal problem which will continue unless it is addressed properly.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/croydon-stabbing-boy-15-charged-murder-zaian-aimable-lina
5804;5804;Newcastle confident of signing Kieran Trippier from Atlético for about £25m;2022-01-03T15:16:13Z;['Louise Taylor'];['Newcastle United', 'Atlético Madrid', 'Transfer window', 'Lille', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Newcastle United are increasingly confident of signing Kieran Trippier from Atlético Madrid by the end of the week and hope to open formal negotiations with the 31-year-old England right-back within the next 48 hours. Although Atlético rejected Newcastle’s initial offer for Trippier, a deal in the region of £25m is expected to be finalised after Diego Simeone appeared to abandon realistic hope of keeping him in the Spanish capital.
“Kieran Trippier is an extraordinary footballer who has given us a lot and we will try to keep him,” said Atlético’s manager. “We want him to stay, he’s an important player, but nowadays, when a player wants to leave, you can’t force them to stay. You can’t retain them.” Although Trippier started Atlético’s 2-0 home win against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, he appeared to wave farewell to the crowd at the end and was the last player to leave the pitch. With Chelsea potentially interested in Trippier, Eddie Howe is keen to seal the reunion with a player he signed for Burnley as soon as possible but Newcastle’s manager seems unlikely to have Sven Botman alongside Trippier in defence when Watford visit St James’ Park for a vital relegation “six-pointer” on Saturday week. Newcastle have had a bid rejected by Lille for Botman, a Netherlands Under-21 centre-half who has recently broken into his country’s senior squad. The French club appear determined to keep the 21-year-old, with an offer in the region of £30m currently insufficient to persuade them to part with a defender also admired by, among others, Milan. Although Lille have financial difficulties they are in the knockout stages of the Champions League, eighth in Ligue 1 and believe Botman remains vital to their European ambitions.
Howe also covets the Burnley centre-half James Tarkowski but, even though Tarkowski could leave Turf Moor for nothing in the summer, Sean Dyche appears adamant he will not countenance weakening his team’s survival chances by selling the 29-year-old to a relegation rival. With Callum Wilson’s torn calf muscle dictating that Howe is in the market for a centre-forward and a central midfield also on his shopping list, Newcastle hope to welcome a minimum of four signings.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/newcastle-confident-kieran-trippier-atletico-madrid-25m
5805;5805;Here’s what a Tory donor and a lavish Liz Truss lunch in Mayfair tells us about British politics | Simon Jenkins;2022-01-03T15:15:03Z;['Simon Jenkins'];['Liz Truss', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Conservatives'];"A woman must lunch somewhere. When the prime minister told Liz Truss to examine every road post Brexit, her thoughts naturally turned to Mayfair and Hertford Street. Perhaps that nice caff at No 5. We are after all lunching with that nice American trade envoy, Katherine Tai. Perhaps two measures of dry gin; three bottles of Pazo Barrantes Albariño, a Spanish white wine, costing a total of £153; and two bottles of the French red Coudoulet de Beaucastel, costing a total of £130. Perhaps a £3,000 bill. Besides, the proprietor of 5 Hertford Street is Robin Birley, half-brother to Boris Johnson’s mate Zac Goldsmith, and buddy of Michael Gove and David Cameron. And he tipped Johnson 20 grand for his “leadership” campaign, wherever that went. Surely such generosity calls for a kindly nod and wink. 5 Hertford Street posted substantial losses last year, so the money might come in handy. Birley even halved the bill if it could be paid straight away. The office wants Truss to slum it in Soho. She hits the roof. Who wins trade deals in Soho? Besides, this is one for Birley. The joy of British corruption is that there are no crude brown envelopes stuffed with notes. Money is never seen changing hands. Negotiation is via a pat on the shoulder, a placement at a dinner, a nod at the tennis net. There need not be a direct quid pro, but favours can flow both ways: a party donation, a contract, a planning refusal overturned, all rounded off with the knighthood or peerage. The British like to pretend their political culture is pure, but benign terms have been used to mask questionable interactions. In times past, the Metropolitan police vehicle for the receipt of informal benefit was the “police benevolent fund”. It was the stuff of legend and occasional comedy. Now, at a time of wild budgetary spending, every dodgy oddball is crowding round the pig trough. Goodness knows what antics will be revealed, if ever, from the proposed inquiry into the pandemic. It should be standing room only at the Old Bailey. The strangest transactions seem to revolve around politicians striving to live up to the dignity of their office, be it flat decorations, country houses or foreign holidays. Lunch at 5 Hertford Street is a classic. Turn to a party donor; at least he could host a good lunch. Truss’s civil servants saw the danger a mile off and steered her towards a more modest watering hole. She would have none of it. It went to her permanent secretary, who let it through, but he is clearly a mouse not a man. Should it now go to the cohort of Whitehall standards scrutineers? If so they must be worked off their feet, with every self-respecting property developer or drug manufacturer feeling they are carrying the weight of the Tory party on their shoulders. Perhaps the best discipline is daylight. Lunch at 5 Hertford Street is hardly a hanging crime. It rather indicates a general casualness towards public funds and relationships; an attitude of mind. Johnson was very nice to Truss. She returns the favour by shamelessly going on manoeuvres to replace him. Now she is currying favour with his friends. Is that who we want as a future prime minister?

5806;5806;Who’s raging over masks in schools? It’s not Britain's impressively resilient teenagers | Zoe Williams;2022-01-03T15:09:57Z;['Zoe Williams'];['Secondary schools', 'Schools', 'Education', 'Coronavirus', 'Young people', 'Society'];"The first professional trip I took was to Jersey, to interview a teenage skateboarder. He was slated to win some big competition, but I’m afraid I can’t tell you whether he did or what his name was. What I do remember is standing by the skate park, next to his mum, in this peculiar low island light, while he smashed himself to the ground, repeatedly, and got back up again. Before long, his elbow was bleeding – but this, his mother assured me, was an old wound, so it opened up most days. He brushed it off – didn’t even appear to notice – along with every other brutal encounter with physics and gravity. “Well, he’s 14,” his mum said. “They bounce at that age.” He skated into my thoughts this week, while the news was ablaze with England’s back-to-school mask mandate. Educationists were (and are) justifiably upset, since they received this communication – that all pupils in year 7 or above should wear masks in the classroom – long after the media had been briefed. But disgust at the absolute dishevelment of governmental standards was nothing compared with the rage of the anti-mask libertarians. It sounds like a niche group, but it includes many Conservative backbenchers, plus their supportive commentariat. Teenagers, these anti-maskers maintain, have already suffered enough. Face-coverings interfere with their learning, leave them unable to communicate with peers, render them insensate to life’s daily pleasures and reduce them to a state of slavery (granted, I saw the last claim on Twitter, where the collective 2022 resolution appears to be “be more crazy”). The thing is, my house is lousy with teenagers and I have agreed, stupidly, to stop writing about them. But I am still allowed to make the most general observations (I think). I have seen them forget their masks, try to eat through a mask, pick up a mask from the street and put it on, and flick each other with masks. But I have never heard any of them complain about wearing one. Please don’t walk away with the impression that this generation has stopped complaining. They bellyache constantly about stupid things, such as having to spend all day in the same classroom, rather than moving from one subject area to another. “What is so fun about walking down a corridor?” I have wondered aloud more than once. It’s the journey, not the destination, they say, sagely. Corridors are where all the stuff happens. Staying put and waiting for the teacher to come to you makes it feel like primary school. Will they put up with it, for the sake of public safety? Yes, but they wish the management to know that it isn’t ideal. They don’t complain, yet it is visible in their demeanours that it saps their life force when they have to attend school from home. They absolutely hate it when non-essential shops are forced to close. They weren’t wild about the bubble phase, when they had to self-isolate after the positive test result of someone they didn’t even like. There was a brief period in 2020 when they were allowed only on certain buses; that was a veritable assault on their human rights. But they adapted to masks absolutely seamlessly, uncomplainingly, faster than a baby adapts to a sock. There are a load of plausible explanations for why teenagers might moan about masks less than adults. They have better hearing, so they aren’t relying on lip-reading without knowing it. They tend to have better cardiovascular health, so they are not constantly wondering why stairs have got harder. Fundamentally, though, they are just more adaptable. We talk constantly about all the ways in which the teenage brain is like an adult brain, only less good – more volatile and impulse-driven, less able to predict consequences – and hardly talk at all about the ways in which teenagers are superior. Their entire day is structured around life’s unreasonable demands and they just acclimatise. This unruffled resilience and psychic elasticity – or bouncing, in 90s skateboarder’s-mum parlance – looks suddenly a lot more mature than what passes for maturity.

5807;5807;David Bowie: publishing rights to song catalogue sold for $250m;2022-01-03T15:06:26Z;['Ben Beaumont-Thomas'];['David Bowie', 'Music', 'Pop and rock', 'Music industry', 'Culture', 'Business', 'UK news'];"The publishing rights to David Bowie’s huge and peerless catalogue of songs have been sold by his estate to Warner Chappell Music (WCM), the publishing arm of Warner Music Group, in a deal worth at least $250m (£185m) according to anonymous sources speaking to Variety. Guy Moot, chief executive of WCM, said: “These are not only extraordinary songs, but milestones that have changed the course of modern music for ever … We are looking forward to tending his unparalleled body of songs with passion and care as we strive to build on the legacy of this most extraordinary human being.” The deal means that Warner now owns the rights to Bowie’s songwriting itself, as well as to almost all the recordings of it. In September 2021, the company completed a deal to acquire Bowie’s recordings from 2000 until his death in 2016, adding to the recordings it already owned from 1968 to 1999.
Just a small cache of recorded music made prior to Bowie’s late-60s breakthrough is now not owned by Warner Music. The company has been lavishly repackaging Bowie’s back catalogue in a series of box sets in recent years. The deal is the latest in a series of major acquisitions by various companies of the catalogues of pop artists, with Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Neil Young and various members of Fleetwood Mac selling the rights for their songs for large cash sums. These deals allow the publishing companies to accrue income from royalties, as well as when music is licensed for use in films, TV and advertising. Terms of the Bowie deal have not been disclosed but the Bowie estate has historically closely controlled the use of his work. The 2020 biopic Stardust, about the birth of Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust persona, was forbidden by the estate from using Bowie’s music. WCM co-chair Carianne Marshall said: “We were pleased that the estate felt that Warner Chappell has the knowledge, experience, and resources to take the reins and continue to promote a collection of this stature. All of our global leaders and departments are incredibly excited and primed to get to work with these brilliant songs across multiple avenues and platforms.” Another film that does already have the blessing of the estate is a forthcoming untitled documentary by film-maker Brett Morgen, who is using thousands of hours of rare and unseen live performance footage as its basis.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/03/david-bowie-publishing-rights-to-song-catalogue-sold-for-250m
5808;5808;Why Europe’s Muslims are braced for France’s stint running the EU presidency | Shada Islam;2022-01-03T15:00:04Z;['Shada Islam'];['European Union', 'France', 'Islam', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'Europe'];"France has taken over the rotating EU presidency for the next six months, an opportunity the president, Emmanuel Macron, will no doubt use to nudge Europe towards his goal of greater “strategic autonomy” in the world. Some in Brussels worry that hotly contested presidential elections in April could interfere with France’s EU presidency before a key conference on the future of Europe delivers any results. It’s not reassuring that Macron’s decision, temporarily, to fly the blue and gold EU flag at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris has already drawn the fury of far-right and conservative election candidates. But many European Muslims are concerned about the French stint in the EU chair for another reason: they fear that France’s divisive anti-Muslim political discourse will seep dangerously into EU policymaking. The French election campaign essentially means it is open season on Muslims in France. Many French politicians have adopted rampant Islamophobia as an electoral strategy. Toxic debates on Islam and Muslims, mixed with acrimonious intersectional swipes at race and migration, are becoming increasingly venomous. Alarmingly, Muslim-bashing is no longer the preserve of the far-right anti-immigration candidate Marine Le Pen. Macron’s hardline interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, accused Le Pen, during a recent television debate, of going “soft” on Islam. The former TV pundit Éric Zemmour has brought an even more vicious anti-Muslim agenda to the presidential contest, while candidate for the Gaullist Les Républicains party, Valérie Pécresse, is taking a hard line on immigration, having previously banned the wearing of burkinis at outdoor leisure centres in the Paris region. Macron himself, who is expected to seek re-election, is already enforcing a spate of anti-Muslim policies, including a bill supposedly aimed at preventing “separatism” and the emergence of a “counter society” among France’s six million Muslim citizens. Macron’s government is also under criticism for shutting down the Collective Against Islamophobia in France, a leading anti-discrimination body which documents anti-Muslim hate crimes. The European Network Against Racism warns of a full-blown “Islamophobic witch-hunt” of French Muslims and says the government is using “countless administrative procedures” to close down Muslim-led organisations, mosques, schools, and even Muslim-owned snack bars, on unproven claims of links to the Muslim Brotherhood. But the fear now is that France will use its EU presidency to push for even tougher Europe-wide measures. It’s a reasonable fear in the context of French ministers calling out Helena Dalli, the European commissioner for equality, for meeting members of Femyso, the Forum of European Muslim Youth and Student Organisations, a network that also participated in a Council of Europe anti-discrimination campaign focusing on hijabs. That campaign caused a political outcry in France as an attack on its “values”. Dalli rightly defended meeting Femyso representatives to discuss challenges facing young European Muslims as “a result of stereotyping, discrimination and outright hatred”. Attacking Dalli for the meeting, Marlène Schiappa, the citizenship minister in the Macron government, said Femyso was an “Islamist association” that was “attacking France” and “infiltrating” EU institutions, allegations which Femyso flatly denies and which its president, Hande Taner described in a statement as “laughable”. An intervention by the French government with the European Commission meanwhile prompted a delay which led ultimately to the cancellation – ostensibly for administrative reasons – of planned EU funding for another rights group, Alliance Citoyenne, which has defended the right of Muslim women to swim in public pools wearing burkinis. My own reports and articles on France and Europe written over the years note a persistent unease about Islam as an alien faith, Muslims as undesired foreigners and an irrational fear of the hijab and of halal food. Diatribes conflating Islam, extremism and terrorism are a tediously recurring phenomenon at both formal and informal gatherings. France’s Muslim-panic has parallels elsewhere. In Austria the former chancellor Sebastian Kurz took aim at the alleged rise of so-called political Islam after the launch of a much-criticised website called “Islam map” which shows the locations of more than 600 mosques. The map, according to rights groups, has led to incidents of violence against Muslims. Denmark’s former immigration minister, Inger Støjberg , was given a jail sentence recently for illegally ordering the separation of young asylum-seeking married couples from Syria and Iraq, where the woman was under 18. Seeming to implicitly link Islam and refugee policy as is often the case across Europe, Støjberg had said she wanted to protect “child brides”. She previously caused controversy by arguing that Danish Muslims be kept out of work places during Ramadan because daylight fasting could create safety hazards. Støjberg has now been impeached, and may be a political outlier, but it is hard not to see Denmark’s hardline approach to “integration” and refugees, including a June law which enables it to transfer asylum seekers outside the EU while their cases are being processed, as at least partly driven by a fear of Muslims. The Austrian academic Farid Hafez raises troubling questions too about the motivation behind the Vienna forum on countering segregation and extremism in the context of integration, an annual conference launched by Austria with the support of France and Denmark to fight “political Islam” and so-called “non-violent extremism and Islamism”. If not outright McCarthyism, as Hafez calls it, such initiatives are a dangerous step towards prejudging all Muslims as a potential threat to liberal societies. Once restricted to the EU’s far-right groups, France’s fixation with Muslims has extended across the European political landscape; Islam is seen either as a threat to national secular traditions or to the idea of “Christian Europe”. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and his EU allies have long raged against Islam, but dog whistling to anti-Muslim extremists is becoming the standard pattern for many mainstream EU conservatives. Even without chalking up any major electoral victories (so far), far-right parties have in effect succeeded in mainstreaming their hostile narrative on Muslims and migrants. No wonder hostility and discrimination towards Europe’s Muslims is widespread as the EU’s own Fundamental Rights Agency warns. The 2020 issue of the annual European Islamophobia report, co-edited by Hafez with scholars, experts and civil society activists from more than 30 European countries, concluded that anti-Muslim racism has worsened across the continent. There are bright spots. In Germany, which welcomed more than a million refugees from Syria and other countries in 2015, the new governing coalition has promised a “modern immigration country”. EU governments and the European Commission are – quite rightly – struggling against violations of the rule of law, attacks on the judiciary and the erosion of media freedoms in Hungary and Poland. But they have turned a blind eye to policies and actions that reinforce exclusion and prejudice in some western EU member states. Being a European Muslim has never been a walk in the park. With about one-third of French voters saying they will vote for far-right and ultra-nationalist candidates, France’s Islam-panic is likely to escalate in the coming months. Despite the EU’s lofty talk of equality, diversity and non-discrimination, European Muslims should be braced for a tough start to the new year.

The forecast follows the hottest new year’s weekend on record when 16.5C (61.7F) was reached at Bala, Gwynedd, on 31 December 2021 – a New Year’s Eve record for the UK and Wales, when it is usually about 7C. The Met Office has issued warnings for snow, ice and winds in northern and eastern Scotland, with the cold air affecting Scotland expected to sink south across the Pennines and into the Lake District, north Wales and the Peak District. These areas could get snow flurries. Tom Morgan, a Met Office meteorologist, said: “Compared to the 16C experienced in London over the weekend, for example, tomorrow it will likely be 6C or 7C. It’s not just the cold air which will make us feel so much colder – it’s also going to be the strength of the wind. When these factors are combined, the change will be a shock to the system.”
An arctic chill will engulf most of the country by midweek, bringing frost and icy road conditions for many. “Factoring in the wind speed, in many areas of the country it will feel like -1C or -2C,” said Morgan. Northern parts of Scotland including the Highlands, Aberdeenshire and Moray are under a yellow alert for frequent snow showers and gale-force winds from 3pm until 6am on Wednesday. The Met Office warned of difficult driving conditions, especially on coastal and mountain roads. It said: “In combination with winds gusting 50 to 60mph at times, temporary blizzard conditions and some drifting of snow on higher level routes is likely.” With cold air spreading south across Scotland and bringing wintry showers, icy stretches are expected to form by late afternoon on Monday. In Orkney gusts could reach up to 80mph.
Forecasters anticipate some train or bus services could be cancelled or delayed where flooding and spray caused by heavy rain occur. Though the Met Office has only issued warnings for Scotland, commuters in England and Wales returning to work on Tuesday could also see some snow, said Morgan. “There is a band of rain that could briefly turn to sleet or snow, around breakfast time to mid-morning. Seeing flakes of snow could be a surprise for many people, given how mild it has been.” Jack Cousens, the head of roads policy for the AA, said: “A mild start to the year will suddenly become cold and blustery over the coming days, with warnings of snow and ice in the Highlands. Drivers should make sure their cars are in good condition prior to setting off. Most breakdowns can be avoided by checking fuel, oil and coolant levels while ensuring tyres are undamaged and have plenty of tread. “Preparing for the worst is worthwhile, so keeping some warm clothes and coats in the car, along with some sweets and water are recommended.” The UK Health Security Agency urged people to check on vulnerable members of the public in the coming days, including elderly people and those with serious illness. The UKHSA consultant Agostinho Sousa said: “Cold weather can have a serious impact on health, particularly for older people and those with heart and lung problems, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/uk-weather-cold-snap-end-unseasonal-warm-weather
5810;5810;Masks in schools: several EU countries already enforce them in primaries;2022-01-03T14:29:12Z;['Jon Henley'];['Coronavirus', 'Europe', 'European Union', 'France', 'Germany', 'Spain', 'Italy', 'Belgium', 'Norway', 'Sweden', 'US news', 'Greece'];"The return of a requirement in England for secondary pupils to wear face masks in class has sparked a backlash at the start of the new term, but several EU countries have already adopted the measure even for primary school children. Some Conservative MPs and parents’ groups have objected to the move, warning of a long-term impact of masks on children’s mental health and arguing that they they will have a longer-term effect on people’s ability to learn and socialise. In countries such as France, however, where a mask mandate for pupils aged 11 and over was reimposed in November after a brief relaxation at the start of the new school year, face coverings have been compulsory in all primary schools since 15 December. The measure, previously applicable to children aged six and over only in areas with a particularly high incidence, has not so far met with significant resistance during a record-breaking surge in infections fuelled by the Omicron variant. Catherine Nave-Bekhti, the general secretary of the Sgen-CFDT teachers’ union, said the requirement was “a reasonable and logical precaution given the current dynamic of the epidemic – the objective, after all, is to close as few classes as possible”. With infections exceeding 200,000 a day, children aged six and over are also now required to wear masks in indoor places open to the public, including shops, cinemas, sports complexes, trains and buses, and outside in big cities such as Paris and Lyon.
Unless the entire class has been vaccinated, Italy has also required all pupils aged six and over to wear a mask indoors at school since last year, while Greece extended the mandate to nursery school children – with masks to be changed three times a day. Belgium made mask wearing mandatory for all children over the age of six, including at school, in early December, with the health minister, Frank Vandenbroucke, saying the key lay in “stopping the engine” of viral transmission among children. Spain’s school children aged six and over have been waering masks in class since September 2020. The rule has generally met little resistance, although the far-right Vox party has sought to make political capital out of opposing it, claiming continued mask wearing by children “could be counter-productive” and affect development. “Almost all children over six have worn masks without rejecting it, they’ve normalised it,” said Mireia Orgilés, the author of a study on the psychological impact of the pandemic on young people in Italy and Spain. “If we explain it to them well, they can understand it and follow the rules. A lot of the time they can accept it more easily than adults,” Orgilés told the specialist publication El Diario de la Educación. In Germany, where federal states can set their own rules, mask requirements have been reimposed as the Omicron surge looms. Masks are mandatory inside all school buildings for all age groups, but can be taken off for exams and presentations. Not all European countries have followed suit: pupils in Swedish schools are not required to wear masks. The state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said on Monday school closures were possible – but not nationwide – when term starts next week. Schools in Sweden have instead been told to take preventive measures such as spending time outdoors, emphasising good hand hygiene, avoiding crowding, and ensuring pupils stay at home if they develop coronavirus symptoms. Norway, too, does not require masks to be worn at school, although children over 12 must wear them on public transport, and Poland has so far refrained from imposing a mask mandate on pupils but warned on Monday new restrictions could be imminent. In the US, where many schools that would normally welcome students back to classrooms are delaying their start dates by a few days and mandating a negative test, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance suggests masking in schools. Policies vary radically across states, however, with more than half having no set strategy but leaving the decision up to local and county governments. Eight states, primarily in the south of the country, have moved to ban mask mandates in schools. As the Omicron variant sweeps the country, teachers were scrambling on Monday to test pupils and staff: all staff and public school students in Washington DC, for example, must upload a negative test result administered no later than Tuesday to the district’s website before class begins on Wednesday. A recent German study found that requiring children – and particularly adults – to wear face masks in schools can potentially decrease Covid-19 outbreaks at schools, since clusters were generally more severe when an adult was the source. Martina Sombetzki, the lead author, said the results showed “mandatory masking of teachers and caregivers and children at schools in the 2020 to 2021 school year each resulted in a significant reduction in the number of transmissions.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/masks-for-school-students-mandatory-in-several-eu-countries

5812;5812;Why has UK’s weather been so mild and is it linked to climate crisis?;2022-01-03T14:19:27Z;['Bibi van der Zee'];['UK weather', 'Meteorology', 'UK news', 'Environment', 'Science'];"Why have we had such mild weather this winter? According to the UK’s Met Office: “The extremely mild spell is driven by a flow of warm, moist air pushing across the UK from the Canary Islands and further south in the Atlantic.” This has resulted in the “unusual situation of one weather system breaking weather records for two days in separate calendar years”. Where was this warm air coming from? Low pressure in the Atlantic below Iceland meant conditions were perfect for a stream of subtropical air known as the Azores plume to drift up to the UK. Michael Dukes, the director of forecasting at MetDesk, said: “This subtropical air came in on south to south-westerly winds across the UK. As the air mass came from so far south, temperatures were well above normal for the time of year with date records broken on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day.” Were records broken? According to the Met Office, Bala, north Wales, reached 16.5C on 31 December 2021, a New Year’s Eve record for the UK and Wales. (Although not the warmest ever recorded in December - that was in 2019, when the Azores plume also reached the UK and brought temperatures as high as 18.7C.) New Year’s Eve temperature records were set across all the other UK nations. Keswick in England hit 15.9C, Kinlochewe in Scotland reached 16.1C and it was 15.0C in Magilligan, Northern Ireland. A daily minimum temperature of 13.2C recorded at Chivenor, Devon, is provisionally a new UK and England record for January, surpassing the previous UK record of 13.1C, set at Magilligan, in 2016 and the previous English record of 13.0C, set at London in 2008. There is also a new Welsh January daily minimum temperature record, 12.8C, which was recorded in Trawsgoed in Ceredigion. This beats the previous record of 12.5C, set at Gogerddan, also in Ceredigion, in 2016. How long did the mild weather last? On Sunday, rain moved in from the west across the whole country. By Monday morning, yellow weather warnings were being issued for snow and ice over parts of Scotland, with a band of cold and rain moving south over the rest of the UK, pushing back the warmth and bringing Arctic air with it. Why did it happen, and is it linked to climate change? The Azores plume has drifted up to the UK before, most notably in 2019, as mentioned above. There are always areas of low and high pressure in the Atlantic, and when the conditions are right, subtropical air will be drawn up to the north. It is hard to link a single weather event to climate change, although the science in this field is improving rapidly. However, said Dukes, as the planet slowly warms it means “we are just a touch warmer than we used to be in similar weather set-ups. So if this weather pattern had occurred in the 1980s, say, temperatures would still have been way above normal, but probably half a degree lower than they were on this occasion.” Will we see more of this in future? Nasa scientists have established that in 2020 the planet’s yearly global averaged temperature had increased by 1.02C from the baseline between 1951 and 1980. In the next week or so, Nasa, Noaa and the UK’s Met office will publish their assessments of how hot 2021 was, but we already know that back in the summer Death Valley hit the world’s highest recorded temperature of 54.4C for the second year in a row. In the last couple of days, there have been extreme contrasts in the US: while Texas hit the highest January temperature in US history, an icy cold front coming down the west coast meant that there was an extraordinary difference with northern Montana of 99F (37.2C) to -39F (-39.4C) – a gap of 138F (or 76.6C) .
Argentina also experienced one of its hottest New Year’s Days, reaching 46.6C at Pozo Hondo. And meanwhile Indonesia saw severe flooding following days of torrential rain. This trend will only continue, say scientists. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that if carbon emissions continue to grow and no action is taken, global temperatures could rise by between 2.6C and 4.8C by the end of the century, with more rain, more drought, and more record-breaking hot weather events. • This article was amended on 3 and 4 January 2022.

5813;5813;Unhappy new year: what can we learn from movies set in 2022?;2022-01-03T14:15:04Z;['Charles Bramesco'];['Film', 'Science fiction and fantasy films', 'Culture', 'Horror films'];"It’s gotten rather tricky to calibrate the the annual relative quotient of tragedy. (For the future reference of misery-focused sociologists, that’s the ARQT.) 2021 was a year of tribulation closing out with a backslide into the same rampant viral spread that we saw in square one of the pandemic that just won’t end – but hey, at least it’s not 2020 any more. As it becomes apparent that we will have to accept a few massive catastrophes as the new status quo, assessing the quality of life turns into a matter of degrees, weighing each fresh stretch of hardship against the last. It may prove some cold comfort to note that things have, by sheer numbers, gotten slightly better since last year. The corollary to this way of thinking, however, is the understanding that our circumstances can always get worse.
Just take a look at the films set in the year 2022, united as they are in agreement that something horrible is just waiting to happen. There’s a futuristic sheen to the number, as if a robot’s stuttering while giving a readout of two, that’s compelled a handful of film-makers to select this date as the point at which a major crisis comes to pass. Whether it’s a chance armageddon landing at an inopportune time or a boiling-over that our species has been building to for years, the movies have marked 2022 as cursed. The only hope as we approach the beginning of another year is that whatever challenges await us, they won’t have the terrible finality of the world-enders listed below. Read on for a smorgasbord of possible apocalypses imagined for the coming months, and take some solace in the small consolation that we have yet to start eating each other: The Dark Side of the Moon
Way before Carey and Chad Hayes made their name by writing 2013’s The Conjuring, the twin brothers scripted this direct-to-video cult classic about a crew of astronauts venturing into a galactic no man’s land. They’ve entered the void of low orbit to repair a nuclear-arming satellite, but a power failure sends them floating helplessly toward a long-defunct Nasa shuttle they board in search of aid. The game of cat-and-mouse that follows is too weird in its particulars to be dismissed as the Alien rip-off it appears to be; the reanimated corpse and the leather dominatrix robot prime us for the grand reveal that the stalker picking off the explorers is actually Satan himself. (Turns out this station is hovering above the Bermuda Triangle.) As unfortunate turns of events go, this one isn’t so bad, by its very nature contained and remote. If the devil does turn out to be one of next year’s primary antagonists, we should be so lucky to keep him stuck in outer space. Soylent Green
Soylent Green, as you may already be aware through sheer cultural osmosis, is people. In Richard Fleischer’s infamous sci-fi thriller, the NYPD detective Frank Thorn gets the ultimate validation for his paranoia about the miracle foodstuff mass-produced by a shadowy corporation, for which the magic ingredient just so happens to be the finely ground corpses of the underclass. The screenwriter Stanley Greenberg (and Harry Harrison, author of the novel Make Room! Make Room!, which inspired the film) was right on the money in his vision of an economy stratified by scarcity, as overpopulation, pollution, and an eerily prescient climate cataclysm exacerbate hunger and poverty. That said, we haven’t yet resorted to devouring each other – that seems to be the one taboo that’s going to hold up through any and all mounting desperation – but we’re not so far off from Snowpiercer’s future of nutrient-rich sustenance bars made from mashed cockroach. Once we’ve cleaned out the global cupboards of actual food, we’ll have no choice but to turn to that which is merely edible. The Tomorrow War
This past summer’s straight-to-streaming Chris Pratt vehicle didn’t make quite the splash a producer might hope for from a $200m budget, but it’s built around an idea with deep resonance in the present day: that it falls to those living now to anticipate and negate the conflicts that will face the next generation. In 2022, emissaries from the year 2051 materialize with a warning of an impending alien invasion twenty-six years down the road and beg for the help of the present-day armed forces to time-travel ahead so they can help beat back the extraterrestrial menace. Pratt’s Green Beret-turned-super-soldier gets the drop on the beasts dubbed “Whitespikes” only to discover that to completely purge the Earth of these hostiles, he’ll have to return to his own time and act then. (It’s worth noting that the aliens were actually submerged in a glacier and released by the thaw of global warming.) Goes to show that the old saying is right – an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of full-bore military offensives. The Purge
When the lucrative spec-fic horror franchise first launched with this flagship film, 2022 was far away enough to allow for acclimation to an unthinkable way of life. The survival nightmare takes place after eight successful observances of the Purge, the annual holiday during which all crime is legal, allowing America to release its pent-up rage and chill out for 364 days of the year. Though this series has yet to realize the full disturbing potential of its ingenious premise, its name has been invoked to describe real-life goings-on with greater frequency as of late. During the run-up to the 2020 election, Donald Trump’s favorite scaremongering tactic was to paint a picture of Joe Biden’s America as a lawless hellscape where marauding gangs sowed mayhem with impunity. In actuality, the tenor of unrest is almost the exact opposite of that articulated in the film: rather than the barely repressed bigotry fueling the Purge onscreen, the demonstrations of destruction during protests were motivated by demands for justice. No Escape
Martin Campbell’s juiced-up B-movie taps a peak-form Ray Liotta for the ex-marine John Robbins, a man imprisoned for the murder of his commanding officer back in Benghazi. He’s sent to the island penal colony of Absolom, where the worst of the worst have been left to their own murderous devices and divided themselves into the warlike, savage Outsiders and the civilized, humane Insiders. The miniature revolution led by Robbins didn’t have all that much insight to shed on the carceral-state debate at the time of its release, but today, it looks like a comically outsized take on a real issue. Its guiding principle that inmates are robbed of their dignity by a system that treats them like easily exploited chattel holds true, if anything rendered more impactful by the advances in public understanding of this sorry situation. We can only hope that we’ll have as noble a leader as the character actor Lance Henriksen to expose the treatment festering in the prison-industrial complex. Geostorm
Well, the good news is that we haven’t implemented the use of widespread weather-control satellites just yet, so annihilation-level inclement conditions on a global scale may not be on the cards. That’s the armageddon facing the human race in Dean Devlin’s admirably dumb eco-spectacle, in which the space cowboy Gerard Butler represents our last line of defense against certain death by Mother Nature. The opening salvos before the much-feared main event giving this film its title are bad enough, ranging from skyscraper-drowning typhoons to torrential downpours of lightning singeing city blocks to a crisp. It’s all a bit store-brand Roland Emmerich in the awed-eyed photography, but natural events of biblical ruin are growing regrettably commonplace. Even if Butler cuts a larger-than-life figure, the threat he faces still speaks to a legitimate fear many of us contend with every time we open a newspaper. His character and his power to stop doomsday is a reassuring fiction, the one man who can change an obliteration the rest of us are helpless to halt.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/movies-films-future-2022-new-year
5814;5814;Romaine Hart: an inspiring figure who reinvigorated cinema in the UK | Stephen Woolley;2022-01-03T14:06:40Z;['Stephen Woolley'];['Film', 'Film industry', 'Business', 'Culture', 'Sex Pistols', 'Music', 'World cinema'];"Romaine Hart gave me my start in the film business, hiring me as an usher at the Screen on the Green cinema in Islington, London, when I was 18; alongside the programmer Roger Austin she taught me fundamental lessons about cinema management that inspired me through the Other Cinema, Scala and later Palace years. As a teenager I had witnessed the transformation of my local, the Rex cinema on Upper Street, a downmarket fleapit that was part of a declining chain owned by the Bloom family (Romaine’s maiden name), to the Screen on the Green, with its progressive and clever programming. It showed critically acclaimed, mainly US second-run classics by day (the first double bill I attended as a 15-year-old was The Graduate and The Thomas Crown Affair). From 11.15pm the late-night cinema club showed cult films such as Performance, audacious double bills featuring Chabrol, Kurosawa and other greats of world cinema and obscure but daring fare like Henry Miller’s Quiet Days in Clichy. The Friday all-nighters of the Marx Brothers and Humphrey Bogart classics were usually packed to the rafters.
To keep this challenging programme viable in newly gentrified Islington, Romaine kept overhead costs to a minimum (I can still feel the weight of those heavy metal 35mm film cases, running them up and down the narrow stairs to the tiny projection box). Sales of Kia-Ora squash drinks and boxes of Maltesers were pushed to the maximum with all of the ushers doing ice-cream breaks with a tray between films – even at 1am. It was tough in the 70s: cinema audiences were at a low ebb and the Screen was barred from showing first-run films, which instead went to the Odeon Angel, ABC cinema on Holloway Road and Essoldo Caledonian Road. Romaine was a shrewd, incisive and – beneath the occasionally gruff but glamorous business exterior – generous person who gave me a fundamental grounding not just in exhibition but also distribution with her company Mainline Pictures. With Roger she distributed movies by Alan Rudolph, Monte Hellman, Billy Wilder and John Waters at a time when distribution costs were at a premium; later on I released Eraserhead with her at the Scala. Programming an all-nighter of films interspersed with live performances from the then unknown Sex Pistols, the Clash and Buzzcocks was just one more brilliant coup that inspired a new generation of punk fans into the cinema. It was an unforgettable event to have been an usher at and another example of thinking outside the box against the oppressive shackles that the film industry had imposed on exhibition at that time. Romaine’s attributes are too numerous to list but, as a woman in the quite frankly sluggish and male-dominated 70s British film industry, her acumen, good taste, quick wit and infectious sense of humour stood out as a beacon of hope for so many who followed. Later I took her values with me into production – her principles of acquiring high quality or challenging films combined with reasonable budgets remain with me as a producer. I personally owe a lot to Romaine and Roger, and to try to put that into words is difficult, but she transformed cinema-going in that little part of London where I grew up and brought excitement back in a pre-home video, pre-multichannel TV time period, when most people were pronouncing the film industry as dead in the water. • Stephen Woolley is a film producer, whose credits include Mothering Sunday, Carol, Made in Dagenham and The Crying Game.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/romaine-hart-inspiring-figure-who-led-the-reinvigoration-of-cinema-culture-in-the-uk
5815;5815;National Trust boss says she received death threats amid ‘woke’ row;2022-01-03T14:00:02Z;['Harriet Sherwood'];['The National Trust', 'Heritage', 'UK news', 'Slavery', 'Black Lives Matter movement', 'Culture'];"The head of the National Trust has said she received anonymous death threats during a “culture war” row over the organisation’s perceived “wokeness”. Hilary McGrady, the NT’s director general, said she did not report the intimidation to the police as “it comes with the territory”. The row was sparked by NT efforts to learn more about the history of its properties, including a report published last year that found connections between 93 of its historic places and colonialism and slavery. Criticism of what some saw as a politicised assault on heritage spilled on to social media and the press. McGrady said the academic author of the report “had a much harder time” than she had. More recently, a group calling itself Restore Trust sought to win seats on the NT’s governing council at its annual general meeting in October. The group claimed to represent grassroots opposition to what it characterised as the NT’s “woke” agenda, and said it wanted to steer the trust “back to its core purpose of looking after our heritage and countryside”. Three of Restore Trust’s candidates were elected to the 36-seat council, although one has denied he endorses the group’s concerns. McGrady said she suspected Restore Trust would continue its campaign despite its failure to realise its goal of six council members. “I would like to engage with them honestly and openly. What isn’t helpful is a war of words. I’m really up for having those conversations … I have to accept I can’t lead an organisation of this scale and not take on these challenges. It comes with the territory and I’m pretty sanguine about that,” she said. Some members and visitors had been “really cross and angry with us” over the issues raised by Restore Trust, she said. “There were also people really delighted and relieved that we’re finally looking at the history that they want to learn.”
McGrady said the past two years had been difficult for the NT but there was “a sense of being able to draw a line” despite worries around the Omicron variant of Covid. There had been a “huge jump” in membership in the past few months, she said. The NT had been on the verge of reaching 6 million members when the pandemic struck. “We did lose a lot of people for all sorts of reasons – financial worries or just knowing that they wouldn’t be able to use their membership – but I think we’ll be back to 6 million this coming year,” she said. The trust has ambitious plans for 2022, including picnics, fetes, beacon lighting and tree planting to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee, and an exhibition on Beatrix Potter in conjunction with the V&A in London. It has also set a goal of being net zero by 2030. “As a very significant landowner, we have a huge part to play in dealing with climate harm,” McGrady said. The trust aims to convert 10% of its 250,000 hectares of land to “nature rich”, and is planting 20m trees this decade. The NT plans to build on work after the report published last year detailing connections between 93 of its properties and colonialism and historical slavery. “Every day we uncover another bit of history. We have an obligation to tell this huge, complex, layered story of the history of the three countries we’re responsible for. The idea that history stands still is nonsense because you keep finding new things.” McGrady said the 2020 report was “first-stage research. The next step is, property by property, to [ask if] we need to do more research. And how would we weave that into the story so that we get a whole history of the place? It will take a long time, to be honest.” She insisted: “No one is forcing this down your throat. No one is trying to make you read this stuff. There’s no sense that we’re trying to preach and, certainly, definitely not judge. We’re trying to provide layers of information; we’re taking nothing away. We’re adding to the complexity of the information available. But if [people] want to come along and walk around the garden and have a lovely cup of tea, I am delighted about that. Why would I be prescriptive as to how people should engage with the National Trust?” When McGrady was appointed to lead the NT in 2018, she wanted to make it a “truly accessible” organisation, she said. “It certainly wasn’t an organisation that feels necessarily for everybody, and it still doesn’t. My mission was to take down any barrier that might get in the way of anyone feeling the trust is here for them.” That included practical measures such as wheelchair access and audio loops, and ensuring that the NT’s staff reflect “the UK as it is”. She said the demographics of its membership were changing from the perception of white, middle-class and middle-aged, but “it’s not as diverse as I want it to be. And I’m as interested in the socio-economic split as I am BAME and people with disabilities.” The organisation’s strategy was to reflect the communities it serves, but the community in the south-west was very different to the community in Birmingham, she said. “I’m very conscious that across the country there are different communities who want different things from the trust. That’s what I’m really focused on. How do we make ourselves accessible to the people who want to engage with us? But what a long way to go, and I’m the first to acknowledge that.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/national-trust-boss-says-she-received-death-threats-woke-row
5816;5816;The UK is in danger of becoming a police state masquerading as a democracy | Owen Jones;2022-01-03T14:00:02Z;['Owen Jones'];['Protest', 'Police', 'Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Insulate Britain', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"Countries that succumb to authoritarianism rarely do so with a sudden dramatic flash, where one day freedom is there and then suddenly it isn’t. It is normally a process of attrition, of rights and liberties eroded by stealth. The political atmosphere becomes gradually more intolerant: hysteria is whipped up against dissidents, whose supposed transgressions are carefully selected to justify a new crackdown. The battle lines are defined between a law-abiding majority and an extreme fringe. This is what has happened in Hungary, governed by a party that once belonged to the Liberal International and now has set up a virtual dictatorship. It is the danger facing our own country, too. I spoke to 21-year-old student Louis McKechnie as he made a journey from the prison gates familiar to countless rebels before him. An activist involved with climate protest group Insulate Britain, he was imprisoned for six weeks after breaching an injunction against road blockades. “I got to the point where I was more terrified of the government’s inaction on the climate crisis than I was about any repercussions the courts would give me,” he said. He was “terrified” of prison, but far from deterring him, his incarceration has made him more resolute. Along with eight fellow activists, their imprisonment was a warning to anyone seeking to take up Britain’s long tradition of peaceful civil disobedience.
Insulate Britain is not popular, but then neither was Pussy Riot in Russia when they stormed a church in Moscow. Now all reasonable people would accept that Putin’s Russia is an authoritarian state – much more so than our own – and we would look to the imprisonment of those protesters as a case in point. But it is easier to recognise repression for what it is in other countries. The punitive measures deployed against Insulate Britain are an example of a country descending into an authoritarian mire. Imagine if another country introduced a law allowing the police to shut down protests for being too noisy or causing “serious annoyance”, allowing stop and search without any suspicion, banning specific individuals from joining protests and granting sweeping powers to the state to decide which protests are allowed. This is what the Conservatives’ police, crime, sentencing and courts bill in its current form allows for. Using the backlash against Insulate Britain, the government has toughened up the law. It exposes the laughable claims of some commentators that Boris Johnson’s guiding philosophy “is that he will not restrict our liberties unless there is an overwhelming reason to do so”, as one senior journalist put it. “It won’t stop people protesting,” as human rights organisation Liberty’s Emmanuelle Andrews put it, “but many more people who go out to protest will be at risk of arrest. It shrinks our ability to make our voices heard in quite an unprecedented way.” Banning orders can bar anyone convicted of more than one protest-related offence from exercising their democratic right. Protesters who attach themselves to others, the ground or an object (or who are deemed to intend to do so) face imprisonment. If a protest is thought to cause a huge public nuisance then stop and search can be used with impunity.
Note the Tory MPs who have defined temporary restrictions to prevent the spread of a deadly virus as transforming Britain into a police state. Like Marcus Fysh, who declared: “We are not a ‘papers please’ society. This is not Nazi Germany. It’s the thin end of an authoritarian wedge.” Or Tim Loughton, who said he did not want to live in “a society in which we ask for papers and deprive people of their liberty”. Yet they backed and voted for measures that strip away hard-won rights and freedoms, dramatically enlarging the ability of the state to deprive its own citizens of their liberty. The danger, as Liberty’s Andrews noted, is that it “changes the face of what democratic participation looks like: that only a protest ‘elite’ who are willing to get arrested” take to the streets. Insulate Britain’s Louis McKechnie may feel emboldened: but many more may be deterred. Indeed, it is inevitable that those most affected will be Britain’s marginalised communities. We know that Black Londoners are up to eight times more likely to be victims of stop and search; and that the Metropolitan police were twice as likely to fine Black people under Covid rules compared with white people. It’s not all over – the House of Lords will debate the legislation in January – but the course Britain is on is clear. From the policing bill to the nationality and borders bill – which further brutalises refugees and migrants and grants power to strip millions of dual nationality Britons of their citizenship – we are coming to resemble a police state cosplaying as a democracy. How gruesome to watch rights and freedoms our ancestors fought for at huge cost stripped away with barely a murmur. Whether we decide to replicate their courage to resist is up to us.

5817;5817;New Year’s Day killings spark call for action to tackle violence against women in France;2022-01-03T13:44:05Z;['Kim Willsher'];['France', 'Domestic violence', 'Women', 'World news', 'Europe'];"Feminist campaigners in France are calling for tougher government action to combat violence against women and girls after three women were allegedly killed by their current or former partner on the first day of 2022. The body of a 28-year-old military recruit who had been stabbed to death was found near Saumur in western France on Saturday. The local prosecutor, Alexandra Verron, said a 21-year-old man, also a soldier, had been arrested and investigators were looking into a possible femicide – the killing of a woman by her partner or ex-partner. In eastern France, police discovered the body of a 56-year-old woman with a knife in her chest after neighbours at Meurthe-et-Moselle reported a violent dispute. The victim’s husband was questioned by police and was due to appear before a judge on Monday. On Sunday, a 45-year-old woman was found in the boot of a car at a property in Nice. She had been strangled. Police were interviewing the woman’s former partner, a 60-year-old man who reportedly admitted having a violent altercation with his ex-wife, and their 24-year-old son, in whose vehicle the body was allegedly discovered. The mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, said he was devastated by the alleged killing and described it as a “horror”. The collective #NousToutes accused the French government of remaining “scandalously” silent on the grim start to the year for women. It said an estimated 220,000 women reported conjugal violence every year, but judges had ordered the use of electronic bracelets in only 379 cases. Lena Ben Ahmed, of #NousToutes, told France Info radio: “These femicides are not isolated cases. They’re not the occasional news story. They are systematic violence. The whole system colludes in these murders because it banalises and minimises sexist and sexual violence. That’s why we are scandalised by the government’s silence.” In France, there were at least 113 femicides last year, an increase on the 102 officially recorded in 2020. In 2019, a record 146 women were killed. Féminicides Par Compagnons ou Ex, the Femicide by Partner or Ex association, which announced the figures for last year, said it was only an approximate figure and almost certainly an underestimate. “Numerous events that are being looked into and are subject to the omerta of the prosecutors’ offices haven’t been counted,” it said. “No, these’s aren’t ‘family dramas’ or ‘separation dramas’ or ‘crimes of passion’; they are conjugal killings carried out by frustrated men who think they have the right to kill … who because of the patriarchal education given to men think they possess their women and children and can do with their lives as they wish,” the association added. Last August, the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, announced new measures to combat violence against women and girls, including prioritising complaints of conjugal violence and ensuring each police station and gendarmerie had at least one officer specialised in treating female victims. “The number of police and gendarmerie interventions for intra-family violences remains very high, with more than 400,000 (in 2020), which is 45 every hour,” Darmanin said. “Not a day goes by without [specialist police] freeing a woman or children who are being held hostage,” the minister added. In the UK, the Femicide Census estimates one woman is killed by a man every three days, 62% of them by a current or former partner. A history of abuse was recorded in 59% of killings of women carried out by partners or ex-partners or a male relative. Françoise Brié, the director of the Fédération Nationale Solidarité Femmes (National Federation of Women’s Solidarity), said tougher legislation was needed, including allowing women to conceal the address where they were living if they leave the family home and a violent partner with their children. Ben Ahmed, of #NousToutes, added: “We need training, education, prevention from a young age in schools, lycées, colleges … obviously we are calling on all the presidential election candidates to make concrete promises that include extra personnel, money and materials to address the question of sexist and sexual violence.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/new-years-day-killings-spark-call-for-action-to-tackle-violence-against-women-in-france
5818;5818;British Council launches inquiry after Kenyan staff allege racism;2022-01-03T13:38:47Z;['Rajeev Syal'];['Foreign policy', 'UK news', 'Kenya', 'Culture', 'Africa', 'Politics', 'World news'];"The British Council has launched an inquiry into allegations from black current and former staff members in Kenya who claim they were subjected to systemic racism. Senior white executives at the organisation, which is the British government’s cultural arm abroad, have been accused of discriminating against BAME Kenyan-born staff, particularly as they were selected and assessed for redundancy. A letter that claims to represent seven current and former staff members sparked the inquiry in July when it was sent to the British Council as well as the Kenyan authorities. It says: “The cases underline a repeated practice by white members of staff to constantly assign Kenyans as underperformers, inadequate, unskilled, unprofessional, and suspects as the organisation abuses its procedures and systems to validate its discriminative practice.” Five of the seven accusers claim they were discriminated against during a redundancy process that they say favoured white colleagues. The allegations come amid cuts in central government funding for the British Council as well as a shortfall of income related to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The British Council, known as the UK government’s main instrument of soft power, launched an inquiry into the claims in September and says it takes racism claims seriously. It claims it is still waiting for all of the complainants to come forward with evidence and has queried some of the claims in the initial letter. One of the complainants who was made redundant said he would not cooperate with the inquiry because it was too narrow in scope to include earlier allegations. Apollo Edewa, 33, a former programme manager at the office in Nairobi for five years until February, said staff believed the organisation gave much greater weight to white people’s opinions compared with black people and now wants to tailor the inquiry to justify its prejudices. He said: “The British Council says it will only investigate these allegations if we allow them to manage the complaints process and select the cases to be investigated. But many former and current employees believe that there is a racist culture in the organisation which goes back many years. White people’s opinions are given more weight than black people from Kenya.” Many of the claims revolve around a recent redundancy programme implemented after a shortfall in income after government cuts to the aid budget. Allegations outlined in the letter include: A programme manager who worked at the British Council from August 2014 to 2019 who claimed they were put at risk of redundancy without adequate explanation. Another complainant claimed they resigned as a senior official of the Kenyan office’s welfare association after a white executive frustrated efforts to channel staff concerns to the senior leadership team. “Staff have no confidence raising concerns through HR … for fear of being victimised,” the complainant said. A manager for the professional skills centre in Kenya who claimed they were among a number of black employees who were unfairly targeted for redundancy. The British Council was founded in 1934 to improve cultural relations and improve social mobility, It generates 85% of its own income, mainly through teaching and examinations, and receives some funding through a government bloc grant. It is facing substantial job cuts and office closures after income from English-language teaching and exams plummeted during the pandemic. Regarding the complaints of racism in Kenya, a British Council spokesperson said that they received the letter in July and launched an inquiry in August but were still waiting for all of the complainants to identify themselves. They also pointed out that 98% of employees were locally appointed. According to the British Council, an individual who recognised details of their case in the letter now says he did not give his consent to be included in the complaint. The spokesperson said: “The British Council takes all allegations of discrimination, racism, bullying and harassment very seriously. We operate in over 100 countries across the world and our values of equality, diversity and inclusion are at the heart of everything we do. “On receiving the anonymous letter, we immediately initiated an investigation. This investigation is ongoing, and we are keeping avenues of engagement open with the author of the letter. The author of the letter has not been willing to be interviewed and has not yet provided evidence in support of the allegations.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/03/british-council-launches-inquiry-after-kenyan-staff-allege-racism
5819;5819;Progressives concerned as Eric Adams takes helm as New York mayor;2022-01-03T13:38:30Z;['Gloria Oladipo'];['New York', 'US news', 'US politics', 'US policing', 'US crime', 'US domestic policy', 'World news', 'Homelessness', 'Society', 'Housing', 'Poverty'];"For many New Yorkers, the inauguration of Eric Adams as the 110th mayor of New York City – and only the second Black person to serve in the position – has evoked a range of feelings, from excitement at the possibility of change to confusion and concern.
Adams’ rise through city and state politics was fairly typical. In addition to serving as a New York police captain, he was the Brooklyn borough president and a state senator. But he remains an unconventional, even enigmatic figure. There are questions surrounding his home address and curiosity about his plant-based diet, but information about his actual policies remains scarce. “Where Eric Adams has thrived, in many ways, is in really failing to lay out a vision,” said Sochie Nnaemeka, director of the New York Working Families party. “His transition has been defined by personality, less [by] an agenda for the city.” Progressives and advocates working across multiple sectors have voiced concerns at the slow emergence of Adams’ plans and priorities, and worry about positions he has taken including increasing the use of the heavily criticized “stop-and-frisk” policy and resurrecting plainclothes police units. Adams’ ascent comes at a crucial time in New York history, as the city seeks to emerge from the pandemic and the economic and social chaos that has come with it. New York’s ballooning homelessness crisis, primarily caused by a lack of affordable housing, is one of the largest issues Adam must contend with. In 2020, more than 120,000 people, including children, slept in the New York municipal shelter system, with homelessness reaching the highest levels since the Great Depression. Covid presented additional challenges, spreading rapidly among homeless populations. Advocates have widely supported Adams’ priority of increasing permanent, affordable housing in a city which has some of America’s most expensive rents. But many have raised concerns about Adams’ main plan: converting 25,000 hotel rooms into permanent apartments, noting zoning and conversion requirements many hotels do not meet. Public housing, managed by the New York Public Housing Association, is another area where Adams has faced pushback. Adams supports privatizing public housing units as well as selling air rights above public housing units. Activists have said such actions, presented as an opportunity to raise capital for blighted buildings, are ineffective and that oversight for private landlords when it comes to addressing housing issues like mold and lead paint would become even more difficult. “His focus is going to be on his big-money donors. That’s been his track record all along. That’s not a secret,” said Fight for NYCHA core member Louis Flores. “We expect him to continue down that road, and for public housing that he’s going to support policies that benefit the real estate development industry at the expense of the public housing residents.”
Despite ambiguities around some of Adams’ plans for addressing homelessness, some experts are hopeful delays in appointments – and Adams’ reputation for flexibility – could be an opportunity for his administration to receive input from community leaders on how to address the crisis, including through the creation of a deputy to oversee homelessness and affordable housing. “Having a bit more of a deliberative process is ultimately going to be more impactful than coming out on day one with an ambitious target for the number of units of affordable housing that should be created that might not actually have the impact of reducing homelessness and housing insecurity,” said Jacquelyn Simone, policy director at Coalition for the Homeless. Proposed changes to policing are another point of tension. Adams, who has described assault at the hands of an NYPD officer as inspiration for joining public service, has faced criticism for his plans to resurrect controversial plainclothes units, an anti-crime department in the NYPD involved in a number of shootings, and increase use of stop-and-frisk, a policy critics have condemned as racially discriminatory. While Adams and his newly appointed NYPD commissioner, Keechant Sewell, the first Black woman to lead the department, have supported these policies and vowed to use properly trained, “emotionally intelligent” officers, progressives have argued that previous training attempts have failed, with many officers continually excused for misconduct. “What does the emotional intelligence of an officer matter if he’s got you up against the wall, patting you down,” said Kesi Foster, a lead organizer with the nonprofit Make the Road New York and a steering committee member with Communities United for Police Reform. Simone said: “The ways to solve unsheltered homelessness is not through policing and pushing people from one corner to another.” Other policing initiatives Adams has sponsored have met criticism, specifically when it comes to New York’s troubled jail system. While Adams has publicly supported closing down Rikers Island, a jail with notoriously poor conditions where several people have died in pre-trial custody, he has also promised to bring back solitary confinement to Rikers, reversing a previous ban on a practice many experts have called “inhumane”.
Adams has publicly opposed bail reform measures, meant to curtail pre-trial detention but rolled back, citing debunked claims that releases have spurred increases in crime. “Changing the bail bill is not going to achieve the outcome the mayor wants. We’re hoping that we can convince him of that during his tenure,” said Marie Ndiaye, supervising attorney of the Decarceration Project at the Legal Aid Society. “Getting wishy-washy on bail reform is pretty scary because there’s a pretty linear correlation between the rollbacks and the jail population increasing,” said Sara Rahimi of the nonprofit Emergency Release Fund. In general, advocates contend there is more to be learned about Adams as more appointments are made, but given his comments so far, many are approaching the mayor-elect with caution and timid hope of being able to advance progressive policy. “Cautiously optimistic and cautiously pessimistic all at once would be the way to go there,” said Ndiaye.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/eric-adams-new-york-mayor-progressive-politics
5820;5820;NHS faces significant pressure in coming weeks, says Boris Johnson;2022-01-03T13:35:39Z;['Peter Walker'];['Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'Boris Johnson', 'NHS', 'Hospitals', 'Politics'];"The NHS will face significant pressure in the coming weeks from the nationwide spread of the Omicron variant, Boris Johnson has said, while rejecting the idea that England’s relatively limited Covid restrictions amounted to a gamble. Speaking to reporters on a visit to Buckinghamshire, the prime minister also had strong words for Conservative MPs and others seeking a swift relaxation of the rules, saying it would be “absolute folly” to believe the threat had passed. There was, Johnson said, “no question Omicron continues to surge through the country”. He added: “I think we’ve got to recognise that the pressure on our NHS, on our hospitals, is going to be considerable in the course the next couple of weeks, and maybe more.” Asked if the decision to have fewer restrictions in England compared with other UK nations or many other places in Europe constituted a gamble, Johnson rejected this.
“The way forward for the country as a whole is to continue with the path that we’re on,” he said. “We’ll keep everything under review. But the mixture of things that we’re doing at the moment is, I think, the right one.” While saying that Omicron “does seem pretty conclusively to be less severe” than the previous Delta and Alpha variants, Johnson warned against people believing that the pandemic was approaching an end. “Looking at the pressures on the NHS in the next couple of weeks, and maybe longer, looking at the numbers of people that are going to be going into hospital, it would be absolute folly to say that this thing is all over now bar the shouting,” the prime minister said. “We’ve got to remain cautious, we’ve got to stick to plan B.” Johnson said he had spoken to the NHS England chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, and its medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, adding: “I appreciate the pressures that our hospitals are under. I think it’s vital that we make sure that we help them by trying to contain the pandemic in the ways that I’ve set out.” His comments at a vaccination centre in Aylesbury came as the chief executive of NHS Providers, the membership organisation for health trusts in England, warned that pressures on hospitals outside London was growing fast. Chris Hopson said the pressures of more Covid patients and of staff absences from Omicron came in combination with an “already very, very busy” winter period. He told Sky News: “It’s those two things on top of how busy the system already was.” With parliament returning from the Christmas recess on Wednesday, Johnson is due to gather his cabinet to decide the next steps before then, with the timing not yet confirmed. However, ministers are expected to keep restrictions as they are, and to keep in place the plan B rules on areas such as mask use, Covid passports and home working, following a formal review, also due on Wednesday. Asked about guidance for secondary school students to wear masks once schools return, which has angered some Tory MPs, Johnson said there was “an increasing body of scientific support for the idea that face masks can contain transmission”. He added: “We don’t want to keep them. I don’t like the idea of having face masks in classrooms any more than anybody else does, but we won’t keep them on a day more than is necessary.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/nhs-faces-significant-pressure-in-coming-weeks-says-boris-johnson
5821;5821;‘I wouldn’t go to the park on my own now’: Plymouth traumatised by killings;2022-01-03T13:27:13Z;['Steven Morris'];['UK news'];"There are tiny but telling hints of what happened in the Keyham area of Plymouth on 12 August last year. A stretch of freshly laid pavement at the corner where Jake Davison turned his pump-action shotgun on himself after killing five people. A pile of compost in a community garden, created from the thousands of flowers left for the victims and set aside to be used when memorial trees or flower beds are planted. The new bench in the park installed in memory of two victims. “Everywhere you look there are awful memories,” said Hazel Lynch, a member of the Keyham neighbourhood watch, one of the groups leading the recovery from that evening in late summer when Davison, a 22-year-old apprentice crane operator who harboured extreme misogynistic views, carried out his 12-minute attack. Lynch pointed out, for example, the area where the air ambulance had landed as children raced for safety and the spot where one boy sat for three whole days afterwards, trying to process what happened. “He wanted to be there and to try to understand what had happened. People are still doing that.” The attack hit not just the relatives and friends of those affected but the whole community. Three hundred people, many of them children, directly witnessed Davison’s attack or the immediate aftermath. Children still struggle to sleep, worried the “bad man” will get them, while some elderly people are too frightened to leave their homes. Many hundreds of personal alarms have been handed out to girls and women and Lynch said she now carries one for the first time in her life. “I wouldn’t go to the park by myself after dark now,” she said. The city had scarcely caught its breath after Davison’s attack, which began with him killing his mother, Maxine, when a few miles away 18-year-old Bobbi-Anne McLeod vanished from a bus stop in the Leigham area of the city in November. Her body was found near a beach three days later, a second disturbing crime with a woman at its centre. Much soul-searching has been prompted in Plymouth with the launch of a commission in the city to examine violence against women and girls. While crime figures overall are down in Devon and Cornwall, sexual attacks have risen. Stalking and harassment is up by 24% on 2019, rape by 18% and other sexual offences by 13.5%. Since September there have been more than 200 referrals to an app that allows people to highlight areas in Plymouth where they do not feel safe.
Millions of pounds are being spent to try to help make the city safer for girls and women through initiatives such as setting up new CCTV cameras, boosting the number of taxi drivers after a post-Brexit drop and introducing initiatives such as bystander training to help people know how to challenge bad behaviour. Alison Hernandez, the police and crime commissioner for Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, said a lot of work was being done but admitted girls and women were too often victims – and did not feel safe. “Although we have one of the safest force areas in the country, violent crime is rising. Bobbi-Anne’s death reminds us that policing must be relentlessly focused on making our communities safer, but we need to engage schools, local government and our public in that effort.” She believes society needs to look deeply at problems ranging from the accessibility to young people of violent pornography to domestic abuse. “This is a problem that cannot be resolved by police officers alone,” she said.
Lyn Gooding, the chief executive of the charity First Light, which works with victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence, agrees. She told a Q&A organised by the new commission that work needed to be done in primary schools to help youngsters understand what a healthy relationship looked like. “We need to have difficult conversations with our young sons.” For Keyham specifically, the Home Office has provided more than £800,000 for additional crime prevention measures and more policing and almost as much again has been made available in the area to pay for extra children’s social care workers and educational psychologists to work in schools. So many Keyham people have a sad story to tell. Olivia, 15, who lives close to the spot where Davison killed himself, said she still thought often about his body slumped on the pavement. “It is still very difficult for a lot of people here,” she said.
Rosemary, whose teenage son witnessed one of the shootings, said she feared his mental health had been compromised. “He is very confused. He finds it hard to understand what happened.” The Labour MP for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport, Luke Pollard, who lives half a mile from the scene, warned that tragedies could lead to long-running social problems such as children struggling at school, rising crime rates, more people suffering from depression. “A whole community, a whole city can be traumatised.” He said people were beginning to ask more questions about the gun laws and in the new year a “Keyham manifesto” setting out what the area would like to be changed is due to produced. Heather Welch, the acting operations manager for Victim Support in Devon, said the shock waves would be felt for many years. It has called for the experiences of survivors of the Manchester Arena attack and the Grenfell fire to learn how to help people in Keyham. “People have had to make sense of the world in a different way.”
The politicians and experts are keen to flag up the great work being done by people such as Hazel Lynch, who is leading the transformation of a rickety old shed on the sports field where the shootings vigil took place into a community cafe, and the neighbourhood watch chairman, Kevin Sproston, who lives by the motto: “Let’s make Keyham as good as the people.” He is still dashing around organising the Safer Keyham programme, which includes providing new security measures, such as better locks and peepholes, to try to make vulnerable people feel safer in their homes. Richard Baron, the managing director of a double glazing company, said he and his team had improved the security at 150 homes, providing the materials at cost. “If we can help make people a bit safer then we’re very happy to do that,” he said. “It will take a long time for this community to heal.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/i-wouldnt-go-to-the-park-on-my-own-now-plymouth-traumatised-by-killings

But it was cold outside and I needed more substance on the plate, so, instead of the crisp lettuce, in came wedges of chargrilled hispi cabbage, all sweet and smoky, which I laid on garlic-rubbed toasts; both were perfect for mopping up that insane dressing. I have made this dish several times since and have loved it every time – I sincerely hope you do, too.

Meanwhile, put a garlic clove and the anchovies in a mortar (or small food processor) with a scrunch of sea salt, and grind to a paste. Whisk in the mustard, vinegar and buttermilk, followed by the remaining four tablespoons of oil in a slow, steady stream, to make an emulsion. Stir in the grated parmesan and season to taste. Put the shallot, parsley and capers in a medium bowl, squeeze over the lemon and season lightly. When you are ready to eat, cut the remaining garlic clove in half and rub the cut sides over each piece of hot toast. Put a piece of toast on each of four plates, drizzle with good olive oil, then lay the warm hispi wedges on top. Spoon over the dressing, allowing it to fall into all the nooks and crannies, then grate over a little extra parmesan. Serve with a generous handful of the parsley and shallot salad on the side.

5823;5823;How we met: ‘He had to marry me or I’d sue him!’;2022-01-03T12:57:37Z;['Lizzie Cernik'];['Relationships', 'Life and style', 'Women', 'Men'];"When Mary moved from Bedfordshire in the UK to Michigan in the US on a Fulbright scholarship in 1985, she wasn’t expecting to find love. Her mind was focused on the nutrition course she had enrolled on and her plans for a future career. In the spring of 1986, she was cycling home from a meeting with her tutor when she approached a fence covered in ivy. Roy, who had been pushing his bike, emerged from behind the fence before she had the chance to stop. “I hit his wheel and, because my hands were cold and I was wearing a backpack, I went sailing over the handlebars,” she remembers. “I landed on my chin and broke my jaw on the concrete.” In typical British fashion, she told him she was “absolutely fine”, but Roy says it was clear she was badly hurt. “My apartment was pretty close by so I got my roommate to drive her to the university health centre,” he says. The next day, Mary had to have her jaw wired shut, meaning she couldn’t eat solid food for three months. “Roy came to my apartment with some juice to suck through a straw. He said that when my jaw was unwired he would make me dinner,” she recalls. Although it was an accident, Roy felt “terrible” about what happened. “I was really concerned about her,” he says. Over the summer they went their separate ways, with Mary returning to her home in the UK for the holidays. When she arrived back at university, Roy had moved in two doors down from her. “By chance, my roommate had moved home and a place turned up in Mary’s building,” he says. That September, he followed through on his promise to make her dinner. They quickly hit it off, and realised they had more in common than they’d thought. “He was on a PhD programme in geography and also had a Fulbright scholarship,” says Mary. “We were both vegetarians and had an interest in reading and travel. Roy had been all over the world and spoke different languages.” He was equally impressed. “I liked that Mary rode horses and had a different accent. She was the nicest person I’d ever met and was very easy to be with,” he says.
Before long they were a couple. “We’d go for day trips to Lake Michigan and study together,” says Mary. “We met in such an intense way, through the accident, that it sort of got rid of that usual period where you get to know someone slowly.” In 1987, they married in the US before moving to England. “It’s a running joke in my family that he had to marry me or I’d sue him,” laughs Mary. By the following January, they had moved to Sudan for Roy’s work. He was studying the impacts of climate change in Africa, and Mary took a contract with Unicef, working in nutrition. “There was a coup while we were there and it became hard to get food, so it was a tough experience, but amazing, too,” Roy says. They returned to Michigan two years later, and their two children were born in 1990 and 92. Mary found a job as a dietitian while Roy became a professor at Grand Valley State University. When Mary suffered a brain bleed in 2012 and was put in an induced coma, Roy cared for her. “She was in hospital for two months and it took two years to fully recover,” he says. “We kept going together and it brought us even closer.” Just as the pandemic hit, they moved to St Louis to be close to their children, now adults themselves. “Having kids was always a priority for us,” says Mary. “We loved having them and they were the best thing that we ever did. We share the same values and always compromise for the same reasons.” Roy appreciates his partner’s poise and calm nature. “She doesn’t jump into the fray – she’s measured. It’s easy to have meaningful conversations and there’s never any drama. We laugh together all the time.” Want to share your story?

5824;5824;Romaine Hart obituary;2022-01-03T12:55:14Z;['Jane Giles'];['Film', 'Film industry', 'London', 'Laurence Olivier', 'Theatre'];"When Romaine Hart transformed the Rex, a 1950s fleapit cinema in Islington, north London, into the Screen on the Green in 1970, she set a standard that would have a profound influence on the ways in which audiences appreciate first-run arthouse films. Described by Quentin Tarantino as “the coolest cinema in London”, the Screen on the Green would inspire generations of future film-makers. Romaine, who has died aged 88 of a heart attack after a typically fulsome Christmas, rejected the fusty, traditional ways of mainstream cinema management. In a blaze of art nouveau inspired branding, the Screen’s opening night premiere of Downhill Racer, starring Robert Redford, included Laurence Olivier, Richard Attenborough and Bryan Forbes among the audience. The cinema’s luxurious seats were made of purple velvet and the ushers wore hot pants. The Sex Pistols, Clash and Buzzcocks played a riotous gig at the Screen on the Green in August 1976, while on other occasions the cinema’s tiny foyer was filled with sand and surfboards for a beach party-themed all-nighter, and Little Nell made a guest appearance naked in a bathtub to promote The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The Screen’s programmer Roger Austin had been inspired by the cinema scenes of New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The rows between Austin and Romaine reverberated throughout the auditorium, but she gave full licence to his maverick programming, which suited the cinephile environments she created. The Screen on the Green made cinema-going both edgy and fun, and contributed to the transformation of working-class Islington into an arty, trendy borough with soaring house prices. Meanwhile Romaine divided her time between her Georgian townhouse in Highgate Village, further to the north of London, and a bohemian bungalow overlooking the South Downs in Sussex. As the unwieldy single screen owner-operated cinemas of previous decades gradually closed down, Romaine’s company flourished, opening new sites in London and the home counties. In contrast to the Screen on the Green’s punk ethos, the Screen on the Hill in Belsize Park became renowned for its Saturday morning children’s film club, supercharged by a local resident, Tom Maschler, then chairman of the publisher Jonathan Cape, and featuring guest appearances by luminaries such as Roald Dahl and Michael Palin. The architects Fletcher Priest brought the allure of glass and chrome to the Screen’s chain of first-run cinemas, typified by intimate auditoriums, sophisticated snacks and specialising in a certain kind of must-see film.
Always having to fight for the best films to show, Romaine set up her own distribution company, Mainline Pictures, acquiring the UK rights to a diverse collection of thrilling world cinema by auteur directors. These included Barbet Schroeder’s Maitresse (1975); Paul Verhoeven’s The Fourth Man (1983); Rob Reiner’s This is Spinal Tap (1984); Stephen Frears’ My Beautiful Laundrette (1985); Tim Burton’s Pee-wee’s Big Adventure (1985); Bruce Weber’s documentary Let’s Get Lost (1988); Alejandro Jodorowsky’s Santa Sangre (1989); and Todd Haynes’ debut feature Poison (1991). Films by women were then few and far between, but the Mainline catalogue included Kathryn Bigelow’s stylish co-directed debut, The Loveless (1981). Thanks to the business acumen of Romaine and her small team, the films Mainline distributed were profitable and impactful, still showing on big screens even once the company embraced home video. One of Mainline’s early acquisitions was David Lynch’s first feature Eraserhead, which in March 1979 opened at the Scala, a repertory cinema programmed by Stephen Woolley, formerly an usher at the Screen on the Green and later a prolific film producer. Romaine was born in Streatham, south London, the daughter of Goldie (nee Mistlin) and Alex Bloom. Her father’s family had owned cinemas and other properties since the silent film era. Romaine left St Mary’s Hall school, Brighton, at 16 to attend a secretarial college and her father taught her the film business by allowing her to programme the Royal Cinema in Deal, Kent. An only child, she inherited Alex’s share in Bloom Theatres following his death in 1968. Romaine also sat on the admissions board of the National Film and Television School, and in the 80s her presence on the board of David Puttnam’s National Film Finance Corporation was a canny appointment, linking the source of script funding to its eventual audience. She was appointed OBE in 1993. Romaine was known as an unconventional risk taker, backing outsiders and underdogs in a male-dominated industry. In 1992 I was a naive young cinema programmer facing prosecution for copyright infringement. Turning to Romaine for advice, I found her pragmatic, kind and approachable, as did the many film-makers she befriended and encouraged. After the seven Screen cinemas were sold to the Everyman chain for £7m in 2008, Romaine retired, but continued to attend the film markets of Cannes and Santa Monica, catching up on movies with her many industry friends, eating well and shopping. Romaine married the businessman John Hart in 1958, and in 1970 they snapped up the Sussex bungalow that became their second home, turning it into an outpost of liberal Hampstead, hosting convivial salons and wild pool parties. Romaine worked with the architect Seth Stein to regularly update her home’s decor; even the nude artwork whose nipples were pressed to turn on the kitchen lights finally went, a relic of another era. The marriage ended in divorce in 1981. Romaine is survived by her daughters, Nicola and Zara, and grandchildren, Xander and Esme. • Romaine Hart, film exhibitor and distributor, born 14 June 1933; died 28 December 2021";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/romaine-hart-obituary

5826;5826;Abducted son finds family by drawing map of village he last saw aged four;2022-01-03T12:46:31Z;['Peter Beaumont'];['China', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news'];"Thirty years ago, when Li Jingwei was four years old, a neighbour abducted him from his home village in China’s Yunnan province and sold him to a child trafficking ring. Now he has been reunited with his mother after drawing a map of his home village from his memories of three decades ago and sharing it on a popular video-sharing app in the hope that someone might be able to identify it. “I’m a child who’s looking for his home,” Li said in the video. Unable to recall the name of his village or his address, Li’s recollection and reconstruction of the village’s key features – including a school, a bamboo forest and a pond – proved crucial. “I knew the trees, stones, cows and even which roads turn and where the water flows,” Li said in an interview with the Paper, a Chinese media outlet.
Shared on Douyin – known outside China as TikTok – on 24 December, the map was matched by police to a Yunnan village where there was a woman whose son had disappeared. That son was identified as Li through DNA tests, leading to an emotional reunion on Saturday. Video footage showed Li carefully removing his mother’s mask to examine her face before breaking down in tears and embracing her. “Thirty-three years of waiting, countless nights of yearning, and finally a map hand-drawn from memory, this is the moment of perfect release after 13 days,” Li wrote on his Douyin profile before the reunion. “Thank you everyone who has helped me reunite with my family.” He told the Paper: “My mother cried as soon as I got on the phone. After the video call, I recognised her at a glance. My mother and I have the same lips, even my teeth.” Abducted in 1989, Li was sold to a family in Lankao, more than 1,100 miles away. Child abductions are common in China and Li was probably taken because the family wanted a boy. Li said he was inspired to look for his biological family after seeing high-profile stories in the media describing two other abduction cases that ended in reunions. He mentioned the case of Guo Gangtang, who became a media celebrity after searching for his missing son for 24 years, travelling more than 300,000 miles by motorbike in his eventually successful search. “When I saw the story of Guo Gangtang, I thought to myself: I should try to find my biological parents … I wanted to see them when they are still alive,” Li said. “I realised I could not wait any longer because my parents should be getting older now. I worried that when I figured out where I am from, they might have passed away,” he told Henan Television after posting his map. Now living in Guangdong province in southern China, Li had had no success in asking his adoptive parents – who he said had brought him up well – or consulting DNA databases about his origins.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/abducted-son-li-jingwei-finds-family-map-of-village-china
5827;5827;John Glacier: the Hackney rapper mingling catharsis and mystery;2022-01-03T12:30:00Z;['Christine Ochefu'];['Music', 'Hip-hop', 'Rap', 'Experimental music', 'Culture'];"John Glacier is someone who knows the importance of privacy. She says she’s “20,000 years old” when we meet over drinks in a London hotel; her Instagram bio reads “I have no name nor number”, and the icy-blokey name she performs under is intentionally deceptive. But in person she is open and friendly, with an unguarded demeanour. “I have no fucking life,” she jokes, deadpan. “I’m like: ‘Yay, something to do today!’” In July, she released Shiloh: Lost for Words, a widely lauded debut mixtape full of conversational, stream-of-consciousness raps over twitchy lo-fi beats. It’s deeply introspective, mixing in religious references and diary-like scenes from her life, with genius wordplay casually thrown in: “Can’t chat to me about grindin’ / Push more lines than Pusha T on a full eclipse, I’m all-nighting”, a beautifully unfolding nest of references to rap duo Clipse on Icing. The tape’s creation was largely therapeutic, to “get certain stuff off my chest,” she says. “[It’s about] circumstances of life and closing old chapters that needed to be closed.” Lyrically, it’s a mishmash of her personal beliefs and memories; things like her views on passing judgment on others, or old memories of writing to friends who were incarcerated. “Nine times out of 10 it’s from my life. Very self-centred, basically,” she chuckles. It was only a few years ago that she got into music, teaching herself GarageBand and Logic for fun and dropping esoteric beats on a SoundCloud page. These soon spread by word of mouth, catching the attention of other producers she met by chance on nights out – people like Psychedelic Ensemble and Vegyn, who, along with Portuguese producer Holly, produced the bulk of Shiloh. Her often muted tracks create a space for “comfort, but also getting lost and travelling your own mind”.
Glacier is from Hackney, London, born to Jamaican parents, the second eldest of seven. As a child she gravitated to the spoken word as a means of expressing herself, giving written poems out as gifts. She soaked up the endless music playing in the house: reggae, pop and country played by her parents, as well as early 2000s rap and grime like Ghetts and Kano, who she saw at Hackney Empire: “I even bought my friend a ticket with my secondary school money – that’s how into it I was.” Growing up, she wanted to be a cleaner, footballer and gymnast. She assisted in film workshops for children with physical and learning disabilities, and started an organic haircare line for Black hair, which she plans to revisit. She lives with a chronic disability, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, so when her music took off it was a happy “accident”, one of many hobbies that ended up fitting around her needs. “It’s realistic for a disabled person to do,” she says. “This one usually involves sitting down – if you do perform it’s gonna be no more than a certain amount of hours. Doesn’t put that much strain on your body at all.” For now, her focus is on handling a growing presence that was wholly unexpected, and figuring out the kinks of the industry. Despite the accolades she is still humble about her talent, and quietly committed to staying true to herself. “Whether people like what I make or not, I don’t care,” she smiles. “I will always make it, because I know I need it for personal reasons. I always make music for myself.”";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/03/john-glacier-the-hackney-rapper-mingling-catharsis-and-mystery
5828;5828;As UK hits peak Netflix the streaming giant will have to work harder;2022-01-03T12:29:17Z;['Mark Sweney'];['Netflix', 'TV streaming', 'Television industry', 'Television', 'Media', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'UK news', 'Business'];"The UK is rapidly approaching peak Netflix with the streaming giant attracting the lowest number of new subscribers in 2021 since launching a decade ago, as it turns to a new generation of “silver streamers” for future growth. With a seemingly endless pipeline of big-budget content, from House of Cards to The Crown and Squid Game, a binge-watching strategy and bargain basement pricing, Netflix has revolutionised traditional TV watching and won millions of British fans. In 2021, however, it is estimated that it attracted just 800,000 new subscribers as it approaches saturation point in British homes. “It is peak Netflix, in the sense we are never likely to see the scale of subscriber additions we have seen over the past few years,” says Richard Broughton, a director of Ampere Analysis, a market research firm. “Netflix will continue to grow, but at a much slower rate.” Globally, Netflix has said it expects to report 18.4 million new subscribers for 2021, when it reports its full-year figures next month, taking its global base to 222 million. The rate of growth is half that seen in 2020 as rolling pandemic lockdowns led to almost 37 million new signups, the most the streaming giant has ever managed in a single year. While the streaming landscape was once a duopoly, Netflix’s rapid early success prompted Amazon to match its international expansion by rolling out Prime Video. There is now significant competition from both global rivals and burgeoning domestic services.
The serendipitously timed launch of Disney+ at the start of the pandemic, populated by hit content such as the $100m (£74m) Star Wars TV spin-off The Mandalorian, resulted in the service adding more UK subscribers in a year in 2020 than any other streaming platform has ever managed. And since 2018, Amazon’s Prime Video, which has built its content base beyond entertainment into live sport including Premier League football and international rugby, has outperformed Netflix in annual subscriber growth in the UK. The pandemic has fuelled record-setting growth. However, this accelerated uptake has “pulled forward” many of those who would have signed up in the coming years, hastening Netflix’s shift towards saturation in mature markets such as the UK. In the US, new subscriber growth has stalled this year. “Netflix has tapped out the early adopter base and is now trying to convert audiences more resistant to paying, to the concept of streaming services and who find Netflix’s content less appealing to their taste,” says Broughton. Which leads us to ask who Netflix is now targeting, and will need to target, to continue to eke out growth in the UK market. Netflix has already burned through most of the younger demographics most comfortable with new technology, and to whom the larger proportion of content is likely to appeal. About four-fifths of people aged 18 to 34 in the UK with internet connections are now estimated to be either subscribers or have access through their families or shared passwords, according to research from Ampere. This is almost identical in the US.
In the 35- to 44-year-old bracket about 70% have access, while there is more hope for new converts among those aged 45-54, with the demographic just 62% won over by Netflix’s charms. The biggest opportunity is among older people: only half of those aged 55 to 64, and who are internet-connected, are subscribed or have access to Netflix. “The one thing holding Netflix back from converting more households is those that are not converting don’t like all the content Netflix currently offers,” says Broughton. “These are older consumers, whose likes are more akin to traditional UK broadcast channels. They like things such as more local productions. Netflix is beginning to tap into that with more new productions targeting these consumers.” While Ampere does not have information available about older demographics, the internet service provider TalkTalk says analysis of its network has shown that the pandemic has fuelled a rise of the “silver streamers”. Internet usage has risen more among over-75s than in any other demographic since pre-pandemic summer 2019, up 72%, as stay-at-home health restrictions forced them to become “more comfortable with leading online lives”, according to TalkTalk. The next biggest rise in usage was in the 65- to 74-year-old demographic, up 66%. “Silver streamers is now a big thing,” says Jonathan Kini, the managing director of TalkTalk Business. “Everyone is looking for more choice and when we look at research on the top 10 streamed shows among over-65s you see a number of Netflix programmes including The Crown, Bridgerton and Squid Game. Streaming shows on Netflix now accounts for a fifth of all peak traffic on our network.” A knock-on effect of Netflix having hoovered up most of the easiest converts is the rising marketing costs of attracting these harder-to-win-over potential subscribers. In Netflix’s earlier years, when new subscribers came with little effort, a single subscriber cost about $40 to $50 in the US and probably a little lower in the UK. It is estimated to have now potentially tripled in mature markets reaching saturation. When Netflix’s inexorably rising production and licensing budget – expected to hit $17bn globally this year to keep subscribers happy and compete effectively against burgeoning numbers of deep-pocketed rivals – is factored in, subscribers can expect more price rises. In March, Netflix put up the price of its most-popular package by £1 a month to £9.99, not a huge increase given a decade ago at launch it was priced at £6.99, but as saturation comes closer to reality there will be more pressure to revisit prices more frequently. Netflix’s growing pains from streaming upstart to fixture in the TV landscape will be mirrored by its rivals, with its position as the most popular streaming service in the UK set to remain intact even as growth slows. Disney, which despite having popular franchises including Marvel, Pixar and Disney classics, is expected to saturate markets sooner because it has a narrower range of content overall. There are already signs of this trend in the UK where its record 3.5 million subscribers in its first year of operations in 2020, has slowed to just 1.2 million this year.
While Netflix’s closest competitor, Amazon, is still growing at a faster rate – it is expected to add 1.3 million regular video users this year compared with Netflix’s 800,000 – it is not forecast to become the market leader in the coming years. “The situation Netflix finds itself is more an indication of historic success in achieving impressive scale rather than a particular fundamental issue facing the UK business,” says Broughton. “Netflix reaches about half of UK households. At its best Sky TV peaked at a little under 40% in 2011, although it faced an arguably harder task with a highly priced service – an enviously impressive position for any subscription business.” Top 10 most streamed TV programmes by over-65s 1 Line of Duty 2 The Crown 3 Peaky Blinders 4 Bridgerton 5 Squid Game 6 The Queen’s Gambit 7 The Handmaid’s Tale 8 Tiger King 9 Below Deck 10 Normal People Source: TalkTalk";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/03/uk-hits-peak-netflix-streaming-giant-work-harder-suscriber-growth
5829;5829;Glorification of Plymouth shooter by ‘incels’ prompts calls for action;2022-01-03T12:28:01Z;['Ben Quinn'];['Plymouth shooting', 'Plymouth', 'UK news', 'Violence against women and girls', 'Society', 'UK security and counter-terrorism'];"The man who gunned down seven people, killing five, in a rampage in Plymouth is being lionised by an online “incel” community, with some ironically venerating him as a “saint” and celebrating the attack as an aid to their recruitment drive. Jake Davison, 22, killed his mother, Maxine, 51, after a row before going on to fatally shoot four others and then himself in August last year. Before his death, he expressed misogynistic and homophobic tendencies, as well as angrily lamenting his failure to find a girlfriend. He also shared hate-filled views on Reddit forums used by incels – men who express online hostility and resentment towards those who are sexually active, particularly women.
Analysis of online forums popular with incels by counter-extremism experts reveals the extent to which Davison’s killings in August struck a chord with many who, like him, were drawn to the subculture. Despite debate as to whether Davison was truly one of them, most of those posting on at least 13 threads hosted on the main English-language incel forum celebrated the attack, according to research shared with the Guardian by Moonshot, a counter-extremism tech company. The killings also prompted speculation about where users believe another attack could occur and the possibility of media coverage of the attacks bringing an influx of new incels. Recent data shows the number of visits to incel forums has increased by almost sixfold in nine months. The Times has reported that web traffic since March to three of the biggest incel sites has grown from 114,420 visits per month to 638,505. Among those who identified as living in the UK, discussions in the months after the Plymouth attack also showed how these sites can be fertile ground for the far right and fringe conspiracy theorists. They included responses to the fuel crisis, in which UK incels embraced “accelerationist” notions that shortages would lead to a larger crisis or civil war, or propagated conspiracy theories that the shortages were deliberately engineered in order to reform society around “climate goals”. More than four months on from the killings, a nuanced debate continues among experts and campaigners in the field about the extent to which any incel threat should be treated as terrorism. The nature of any response is also discussed, though there is agreement around bolstering often stricken mental health services and engaging in outreach. Alex Amend, the director of communications at Moonshot, said it was notable that incels identifying as UK-based did not only deride what they regarded as UK society’s “gynocentricism” and “progressive” politics, or share familiar extreme rightwing sentiment. “UK users also discuss broader societal issues, and criticise the UK government, complain about their difficulties finding affordable housing and sustainable employment, as well as accessing mental health support through the NHS. Users regularly describe London as particularly isolating, and note that making friends as an adult there is challenging,” he said. Amend suggested there should be investment in outreach, adding: “Creating alternative spaces for at-risk men and boys to share grievances in a healthy environment would also help, especially if those environments are connected to available mental health resources.” Tim Squirrell, head of communications at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based extremism thinktank, warned against expanding Britain’s current counter-extremism and “securitising” the incel community. “We need to recognise that many people, particularly young men, who essentially need some combination of social services, mental health support and other kinds of non-securitised intervention are instead being caught up by counter-terrorism programmes,” he added, echoing privately expressed concerns of some involved in the Prevent counter-extremism programme that they have become the safety net for cases who should otherwise have been picked up by underfunded mental health services. Laura Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, described the understanding of the police about the potential incel threat as “patchy”, adding that she had carried out training with some forces to raise awareness. The speed at which investigators said there was no link to terrorism was an indication of the way in which the threat was viewed at a high level, she said, before adding: “You cannot just quantify this in terms of, for example, the numbers of attacks alone.” “My day to day interactions with young people would suggest the impact of this form of radicalisation when it comes to the treatment of teenage girls by their male peers is enormous,” said Bates, who called for greater resources and training for teachers. “One optimistic thing is that more schools are reaching out for training now. There is more awareness and appreciation of the link between the epidemic of school sexual violence and factors such as incel radicalisation.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/glorification-plymouth-shooter-incels-prompts-calls-for-action
5830;5830;Charlie Sheen on making Platoon: ‘We screamed for the medic!’;2022-01-03T12:27:45Z;['N/A'];['Film', 'Culture', 'Charlie Sheen', 'Oliver Stone', 'Vietnam war'];"Charlie Sheen, played Chris Taylor My brother Emilio Estevez and I were huge fans of Scarface and Midnight Express, which were both written by Oliver Stone. Emilio kept talking to me about Oliver’s new Vietnam film, which he was auditioning for. He got the lead part, Chris Taylor, but then couldn’t do it because of scheduling conflicts. When I auditioned, Oliver said I was “too mannered” and needed to do more work. So I did The Boys Next Door and Lucas – and I got the part, but only if Willem Dafoe approved. I didn’t meet Willem until we got to the Philippines. He ran past me in our hotel and gave me a hug. Later, Oliver came up to me and said: “Willem digs ya.” Oliver dumped us in the jungle and put us through a gruelling training course. It was insane. You had to be treated according to your rank. Willem and Tom Berenger, playing two sergeants, were in command and I was an FNG – a “fucking new guy”. It really felt as if I was expected to scrub latrines, which I actually ended up doing in the movie. I thought we’d go out in the day then return to the hotel at night, but at sundown on the first day, there was no bus pulling up. I looked at Johnny Depp and Forest Whitaker and said: “I guess we’re just staying here.” It was a shock – but I don’t know if we could have captured the authenticity without that intense boot camp. Relationships that were forged there still exist to this day. We survived together.
Everybody was tired and angry. At one point, we found a coconut grove and Forest somehow got a coconut. I can still see him now, trying to line it up with his machete. Before I could say, “Your thumb is too close!” he swings and hits his thumb dead centre. He popped it into his mouth and two thick streams of blood poured out both sides. It was a “scream for the medic” moment – and that was still in training camp. Oliver’s easily one of the smartest people I’ve ever met but he likes to show that off. When I knew I could get a laugh out of him, and he saw that I gave him respite from his self-imposed darkness, we got along famously. I remember the scene where Kevin Dillon goes nuts in the village with some poor guy. As my character was shooting the ground and losing his mind, I could see Oliver just off camera pumping his fist, jumping up and down and wanting to scream “Fuck yeah!” but not ruin the take. When I wrapped, there was a coup brewing in Manila and Oliver was taking his director of photography and a camera into the streets to film it, which was madness. I got on the flight home and, as we banked over the country, I could see everything I had left behind, everything we had all experienced. I started weeping because I was just happy to be alive. Veterans thank me for finally telling their story and a lot of them have tears in their eyes. It’s their life. John C McGinley, played Sergeant O’Neill I didn’t find the training that big a deal physically, but what was hard was learning how to read maps, load weapons and be in this triple canopy jungle out in the middle of frickin’ nowhere. We were eating MREs – Meals Ready to Eat – and nobody could poop. Willem drank water from a river when there was a decomposing oxen downstream and he got medivacked, Tom dropped a knife in his fucking foot – it was just all getting terribly real. And there were snakes. Two weeks earlier, we were running around New York’s West Village having coffee, bagels and talking about Hamlet. Now we’re in the jungle with bamboo vipers. Oliver loved it, of course.
After that boot camp, it took only a tiny imaginary leap to believe what we were saying. When my character said, “I gotta get the fuck out of here”, I meant it. My mother was having a brain operation back in Pittsburgh. There was no acting. I only felt in danger once, when I almost fell out of a helicopter. It was up about 1,000ft. It was supposed to land and we would run out and past the camera. Something was going wrong on the ground, so they wanted to go to a different area. For three weeks, we’d been drilled that the one thing you don’t ever let go of is your weapon – so as the helicopter turned, I start to fall out because I was holding it. Francesco Quinn, who played Rhah, grabbed my backpack and pulled me in. If he hadn’t done that, I would’ve fallen out. I got pretty righteous with Oliver after that. During the film’s final battle, my character hides by covering himself with a dead body. Afterwards, on a press tour, I was seeing veterans and doing self-help chats – which I had no right doing. Dozens of vets would tell me they covered themselves with bodies too. They would be weeping. I was just this 26-year-old donkey, way out of my depth, but none of that was lost on me. What Oliver touched on, all of that stuff, was overwhelming.";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/03/charlie-sheen-how-we-made-platoon-oliver-stone
5831;5831;English cricket has much bigger problems to address than Joe Root’s captaincy | Mark Ramprakash;2022-01-03T12:19:21Z;['Mark Ramprakash'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'Joe Root', 'England cricket team', 'Australia cricket team', 'The Ashes', 'Cricket', 'Australia sport', 'Sport'];"Three matches and three heavy defeats into the series, the Ashes already lost, seven defeats and no wins in eight Tests in Australia as captain, and after a poor year for England’s red-ball team there are several obvious reasons for removing Joe Root from the England captaincy – but I would like him to stick around. In his book The Captain Class, the Wall Street Journal’s Sam Walker identifies the key characteristics of elite captains which include: extreme doggedness and focus in competition; a low-key, practical and democratic communication style; motivating others with passionate non-verbal displays; strong convictions and the courage to stand apart; and ironclad emotional control. England’s failures will bring criticism, but Root has many of the qualities you would look for in an ideal captain.
He is also incredibly popular among the playing group, meaning he can comfortably socialise with any of the players in his squad. He has a great sense of humour, which helps to put people at ease. Anyone going into that dressing room has a captain who is approachable, knowledgeable, and who they can learn from. What he needs is an experienced coach who is able to provide a vision and strategy across the England set-up, while also helping Joe with his leadership skills and his tactics, reviewing with him sessions of play and decisions made. Sometimes under Root there have been tactical missteps, both in individual sessions and across entire series. For example he went to Sri Lanka in 2018 wanting the team to play an aggressive style of batting, a different approach to many England sides against Sri Lanka’s spinners, and although that tactic worked in those conditions England then went to the West Indies wanting to continue in that vein. Against good, accurate swing bowling England started the series by being bowled out for 77 when a rather more orthodox attitude was needed. I have one particularly strong memory of Joe from later in that tour. England were 2-0 down when they arrived in St Lucia for the final Test, and though the team had the day off Joe wasn’t happy with the way he was batting so we went to the beautiful ground at Gros Islet and had two hours in the nets. It was probably my most enjoyable session as a coach, to be with a great player, to listen to how he spoke about the game and watch how he worked on it. I remember someone asking me when I first took over as England’s batting coach: “What on earth can you tell Alastair Cook?” With players of that calibre you don’t tell them anything, you try to ask the right questions so they problem-solve. In those two hours in the hot Caribbean sun Joe worked hard on his alignment, his bat path and his basics. My job was to listen, to encourage, support, and now and again to challenge. He scored a second-innings century as England won the third Test comfortably.
I think we have seen Joe improve as a captain, but while he has tried to be more proactive it isn’t a particular strength of his. Too often we don’t see him dictating terms through good captaincy. For example, he dismissed Travis Head in the first innings in Adelaide but has not bowled a single delivery at him since. I’m absolutely convinced that a captain such as MS Dhoni or Kane Williamson would have brought Joe straight on to bowl the next time Head came out. Small things like that can make life uncomfortable for a new batter, and show a flexibility in approach. Root also often fails to use his fielding positions to create doubt in the minds of incoming batters: stick a man short on the leg side when a batsman is on nought, put someone at silly point, try to build pressure. But regardless of how good a captain you are, if you’re consistently not scoring enough runs as a team you never have the chance to be innovative with your bowling attack. Problems with player availability and team selection have hindered England in the past year. The big one is Ben Stokes, one of the team’s core players, who missed too much cricket to come in and perform in this Ashes series. Jonny Bairstow has been marginalised despite having a good record as wicketkeeper-batsman, the gloves taken off him, not being consistently picked, and I think his confidence has been affected. His treatment contrasts with that of Jos Buttler, who has never given me the impression that either technically or in terms of mindset he is comfortable batting in Test cricket.
With the bat there is no doubt that Root has led by example. To score 1,708 runs in a calendar year, more than England’s next four highest scorers put together, is a monumental achievement, and his ability to focus on his own personal game despite wickets falling around him and the added concerns of captaincy is phenomenal. And he has also been able to transition from being incredibly successful in short‑form cricket to making thousands of runs in Tests, which for me demonstrates the importance of an orthodox technique. I remember watching Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul open for India last summer – two players with huge amounts of runs in the Indian Premier League, yet also able to open in a Test against Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad in overcast English conditions. With a few exceptions most of the batters who have been able to move between formats have, like Sharma and Rahul, superb defensive technique, good judgment around off stump, and excellent concentration. When I visited India as assistant coach to England Under-19s in 2016 the insistence within the Indian structure on good batting basics was obvious. Meanwhile I spoke to an MCC coach recently who happily told me that when kids come to Lord’s he tells them to just smack the ball and have fun. There are many significant problems facing English cricket at the moment, and I don’t think Joe Root is one of them.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/03/english-cricket-has-much-bigger-problems-to-address-than-joe-root-captaincy-ashes-australia-england
5832;5832;Fury as EU moves ahead with plans to label gas and nuclear as ‘green’;2022-01-03T12:18:54Z;['Jennifer Rankin'];['European Commission', 'Energy industry', 'Nuclear power', 'Gas', 'Fossil fuels', 'Europe', 'Environment', 'Energy', 'European Union', 'Green politics', 'World news'];The European Commission is facing a furious backlash over plans to allow gas and nuclear to be labelled as “green” investments, as Germany’s economy minister led the charge against “greenwashing”. The EU executive was accused of trying to bury the proposals by releasing long-delayed technical rules on its green investment guidebook to diplomats on New Year’s Eve, hours before a deadline expired. The draft proposals seen by the Guardian would allow gas and nuclear to be included in the EU “taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities”, subject to certain conditions. The taxonomy is a classification system intended to direct billions to clean-energy projects to meet the EU goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Robert Habeck, who became the economy and climate action minister last month as part of a traffic-light coalition of Social Democrats, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens, said the plans “water down the good label for sustainability”. Habeck, a co-leader of the Greens, also told the German press agency dpa it was “questionable whether this greenwashing will even find acceptance on the financial market”. Austria’s government repeated its threat to sue the commission if the plans go ahead. Leonore Gewessler, the country’s climate action minister, said neither gas nor nuclear belonged in the taxonomy “because they are harmful to the climate and the environment and destroy the future of our children”. She added: “We will examine the current draft carefully and have already commissioned a legal opinion on nuclear power in the taxonomy. If these plans are implemented in this way, we will sue.” She also accused the commission of a “a night and fog operation” in the timing of the publication, a charge echoed by Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, who described the draft as a provocation. However, opponents are not expected to secure the supermajority needed to block the plans. France and other pro-nuclear states, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, support the inclusion of nuclear, while many governments in central, eastern and southern Europe lobbied for gas to be included as a “bridge” fuel. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner of the FDP, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung on Sunday that Germany needed gas-fired power plants as a transition technology because it was foregoing coal and nuclear power. “I am grateful that arguments were apparently taken up by the commission,” he said. He was speaking after Germany closed three of its six nuclear power plants on Friday, to meet a pledge of phasing out the technology by the end of 2022. France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said the proposal was good on a technical level and the EU could not reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 without nuclear power. Under the draft, gas could only be classed as a “sustainable investment” if “the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources” and plans are in place to switch to renewables or “low carbon gases” by a specific date. Nuclear power could only be included if a project demonstrated it had a plan to deal with radioactive waste. NGOs accused the commission of seeking to evade scrutiny. WWF, a member of an official expert group on the taxonomy, said the commission had allowed just eight working days – until 12 January – to provide a formal response “to this highly complex and controversial file”, whereas most Brussels consultations last four weeks. “The European Commission couldn’t have tried harder to bury this proposal,” said the WWF spokesperson on sustainable finance, Henry Eviston. “For fossil gas and nuclear, we get a document written behind closed doors and published on New Year’s Eve. If the EU is confident in this proposal, it must hold a public consultation.” The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through “delegated acts” – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. The plans have already attracted the ire of Greta Thunberg and other young climate activists, who say this “fake climate action” contradicts the EU’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

5833;5833;‘We can transition to a better country’: a trans Colombian on diversity in ecology and society;2022-01-03T12:15:46Z;['N/A'];['Global development', 'Environment', 'Colombia', 'Americas', 'World news', 'Transgender', 'Biodiversity', 'Conservation', 'Wildlife', 'Society', 'Farc', 'Amazon rainforest', 'Universities', 'Higher education', 'Deforestation'];"When Brigitte Baptiste walks on to the 10th floor of Bogotá’s Ean University at 9.45am in a plunging dress, knee-high cheetah-print boots and a silvery wig, the office comes to life. She examines some flowers sent by the Colombian radio station Caracol to thank her for taking part in a forum, her co-worker compliments her on her lipstick, and she settles in for a day of back-to-back meetings, followed by a private virtual conversation with the UN secretary general, António Guterres. Later that evening, she flies to Cartagena for a conference on natural gas. The 58-year-old ecologist is one of Colombia’s foremost environmental experts, and one of its most visible transgender people, challenging scientific and social conventions alike. An ecology professor at the Jesuit-run Javeriana University for 20 years, she has written 15 books, countless newspaper columns, and won international prizes for her work. Most recently, she was appointed chancellor of Ean University, a business school, as part of its push for greater sustainability.
Baptiste was one of the scientists who founded the Humboldt Institute, the leading biodiversity research centre in Colombia, and she was the director for eight years. Much of her research involved rural development, and biodiversity’s role in land management. It took her to communities from the Amazon to the coast. She saw the “social character of conservation” and the links between war, displacement and environmental degradation. A forceful proponent of a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), she saw a deal as an opportunity for a “great ecological experiment” in the swaths of former Farc territory had been unexplored for years.
Baptiste is a biodiversity expert in a biodiverse country facing destructionfrom deforestation, land grabs, drug trafficking, illegal farming and the displacement of indigenous people. Water pollution from illegal gold mining and inadequate sewage systems have also taken a toll. And this year Colombia was named the world’s deadliest country for environmental defenders for the second year in a row. Threats to activists concern her more than any other issue, which is what she planned to highlight to Guterres that night in the three minutes allotted to her. “There is no democracy that can be built on violence, on the extermination of unarmed people,” she says. “There may be many things in Colombia that do not work well environmentally, economically – but all that goes into the background until we are able to respect human rights and guarantee the lives of all Colombians.” Meetings with world leaders are not uncommon in Baptiste’s career, but the natural-gas conference the following day – where she push energy companies to offset carbon – is a change of pace from the insular world of academia. She decided to take on this role, and the fossil fuel industry meetings that come with it, to apply the results of a lifetime of biodiversity research, and to achieve change from within the system. Baptiste is a believer in “green capitalism” – that the free market can promote sustainable development.
“There have to be businesses that are not only good for your pocket, they have to be good for people, they have to be good for nature, they have to be good for future generations,” she said. “So that is the idea of sustainable entrepreneurship. That is the contribution that I bring to this school, a search to build that concept in theory and in practice.” Her views have sparked a backlash from environmental activists, but Baptiste sees her job as encouraging Colombians to value their biodiversity as an economic bounty that can be harvested sustainably. “With businessmen, with bankers, they are always the evil ones at the table,” she says, but stresses: “You have to work with the bankers, the investors, obviously you have to work with the decision-makers, with the politicians, with the civil organisations, and without fear of open debate, whether it’s convenient or not.” Baptiste has achieved stature in a conservative Catholic country, where violence and discrimination against transgender people are widespread. Between 2019 and 2020 alone, at least 448 LGBT people suffered acts of violence including murder and police brutality.
Baptiste says that now she only faces discrimination on social media, not at work. But does not believes that reflects a higher level of trans acceptance in Colombia. “I don’t think so,” she says. “I believe that what I have achieved, whether it be a little or a lot, was because I built it before becoming Brigitte publicly.” Baptiste transitioned in 1998 aged 35, and had already completed a master’s degree and a doctorate, co-founded and directed a non-profit and served on boards. People respect her because she had earned “guaranteed spaces” before she transitioned, she says, although there are those that feel they “have to put up with Dr Brigitte” with a hint of “yes, la doctora” – she says, imitating her naysayers. “So the gender issue is always used to question the legitimacy of my work.” “Having a trans woman rector was a bet the university made,” she says. “A generous bet, but also calculated to send a message to society: that this is a different university that can welcome a trans woman as rector. “But because I already came with an important visibility,” she adds, “who knows if the same thing would have happened with other trans women?” Daniela Maldonado Salamanca, director of the Trans Community Network in Bogotá, cautions that Baptiste can often be held up as successful in a way that ignores the barriers that prevent most trans women with fewer privileges achieving similar success. “We are very far from being there – socially, economically [and] in access to educational capital,” says Salamanca. “Light years from those processes.”
Baptiste is still misgendered daily, in taxis and restaurants and says trans women have still not achieved “a minimum of linguistic respect” in Colombia. She is hopeful she will prompt more acceptance.
“If she has been able to do all the things that she has managed to do, a country like this has all the hopes in the world,” says her colleague, executive director of Ean University Billy Crissien. “We can transition to being a better country, we can transition to being better people, we can transition to being what we want to be as a country,” he says. “Brigitte has shown us a way that wonderful things can be done. I think she fills us with hope for a country like us.”";https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/03/brigitte-baptiste-high-profile-transgender-woman-and-ecologist-colombia-targeted
5834;5834;The tiny youth football club with a lesson for how Labour can help people right now | Rachel Shabi;2022-01-03T12:10:46Z;['Rachel Shabi'];['Food banks', 'Nottingham', 'Labour', 'Communities', 'Society', 'Politics', 'England', 'UK news'];"The footballer Marcus Rashford’s free school meals campaign last year set off untold chain reactions across the UK In the case of Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire, Labour activists had been running a campaign to provide food aid for local people during the pandemic when they heard about another project nearby: Phoenix FC, a youth football club inspired by Rashford to provide lunch boxes to local families in need. Members of Broxtowe Labour party went round bearing multipacks of crisps and offers of help. When I visited Phoenix FC on a recent weekday, their coach Darren admitted that he and club manager “Bomber”, both full-time workers and parents in their late 30s, were initially suspicious of the Labour people turning up at the door. But a relationship was forged in the heat of the crisis: any local group offering support was inundated with requests, as the pandemic plunged swaths of the population into food poverty. Demand soon exceeded capacity at Phoenix, so the Labour team connected the club to Himmah, a grassroots action network running one of Nottingham’s largest food banks, which provided boxed, ready-to-dispatch supplies. One year on, Phoenix FC are setting up a new community centre, with a lease and funding from the cross-party council. They operate in Chilwell, a traditionally white working-class Nottingham suburb, where public spaces and services have been gutted by austerity, leaving people with nowhere to go. The plan is to use the space to run coffee mornings and after-school clubs, alongside skills training and anti-racism awareness, from a now-empty nursery building. The new community centre could be seen as a sign of the serendipitous power of mutual aid: the unexpected possibilities that open up when people pool their time, skills and resources. But it is also the kind of thing that Labour’s community organising unit might have been able to create, if it were still running. The national unit was set up by Jeremy Corbyn in 2018, and had been operating in Broxtowe in the run-up to the 2019 election – but was disbanded by Keir Starmer in February. Without a Labour MP – Broxtowe is a marginal seat that has been Conservative since 2010 – and with no say-so from Labour HQ, local members decided to reboot a version of this dormant form of community organising for the pandemic. Whereas many of the mutual aid efforts established via WhatsApp groups since March 2020 have explicitly sought to steer clear of party politics, Broxtowe shows that the two approaches to political organising can successfully overlap.
I recently sat down with the chair of Broxtowe CLP, Jane Marshall, at the local party’s community hub – a drop-in centre that during the worst months of the pandemic also delivered about 300 food parcels a week. Marshall suggested it was entirely possible to copy and paste the Labour values of collectivism and solidarity on to the mutual aid model: “When there is a crisis, people look to see who has stepped up, and it should be Labour that [does].” Responding to the immediate needs of neighbours for medicine and food deliveries, pandemic mutual aiders uncovered a deeper crisis: the combined effect of economic neglect, insecure work, atomised neighbourhoods and a hobbled welfare state. Labour’s community organising unit had been set up to respond to this shocking decline, not with top-down solutions imposed from London, but by empowering and supporting those already engaged in grassroots work locally. People like Bomber and Darren at Phoenix FC. It’s hard to overstate the positive impact and the trust generated when Labour volunteers show up consistently in a neighbourhood more accustomed to being ignored. In places such as Chilwell, for too long the prevailing view of politicians and campaigners has been that you’ll only see them at election time, bearing clipboards and empty promises. The challenge for Labour isn’t simply to tally votes but to persuade people of the value of voting at all, so diminished is the idea that politics could ever change anything. Coaches at Phoenix FC see the area’s youth written off, and a pervasive sense that nobody could ever improve their situation. The club want to provide young people with skills training that could be an essential first rung in the ladder to formal learning. They have already helped funnel young people into universities and apprenticeships, and the new community centre could act as a force multiplier. Himmah, the Communication Workers Union and Unite are also helping with funding and potential skills training for community centre users. It’s a collaboration bringing in different networks, all pulling in the same direction, wanting the area to be better for everyone. For Sajid Mohammed, Himmah’s co-founder and a local Labour councillor, helping create a climate of social cohesion is a core part of the work. “We have common problems and can’t allow our working-class communities to be split on race, gender or sexuality, or else we will all lose out.” Appraisals of Labour’s decline in its long-held heartlands often suggest the party has lost touch with socially conservative white working-class voters. That much was telegrammed in leaked strategy plans earlier this year, showing the Starmer leadership in pursuit of an “authentic values realignment” premised on flags and dressing smartly. Rather than fobbing off communities in long-neglected areas with a bit of red-white-and-blue, why not offer them the means to make things better? Phoenix FC’s managers didn’t need to be told to set up a community centre, or to have it set up for them. Instead, they sought advice on getting funding, and navigating the gnomic local council planning process. Broxtowe Labour marshalled the resources required: a slow-burn, quietly radical act more impactful than the empty pledges of remote political leaders. When the Phoenix pair talk about their new community space – for which they are about to sign a lease – their enthusiasm is infectious. They want to consult the community it is intended to serve first, but already see the centre bringing in elderly people and stay-at-home parents, after-schoolers and dog-walkers, hosting cookery clubs, mental health and diversity awareness groups. Their plans are full of a spirit of revival and care and connection. Imagine the power of that.

5835;5835;Minyan review – passion and paranoia in gay Jewish identity drama;2022-01-03T12:00:46Z;['Peter Bradshaw'];['Film', 'Drama films', 'Judaism', 'New York', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'Culture', 'Religion', 'US news', 'World news'];"This is the fiction feature debut from film-maker Eric Steel, previously responsible for the controversial documentary The Bridge, about people who kill themselves by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. Minyan is a subdued, withdrawn emotional drama set in the 1980s among the Russian Jewish immigrant community of New York’s “Little Odessa”. David (Samuel H Levine) is a young Jewish gay man who reads a lot of James Baldwin; he is at odds with his overbearing parents and much closer to his recently widowed grandfather Josef (Ron Rifkin) who has now got a modest but comfortable apartment in a much sought-after subsidised residency building for observant Jews. David comes to live there, too, both agreeing to make up the numbers required (the “minyan”) for public worship. David can see that two of the older Jewish men in the building are in fact a couple, their relationship accepted on a don’t ask, don’t tell basis, but whose sexual identity has in formal terms been suppressed, or at any rate tacitly considered by them irrelevant in comparison with the horrors they lived through during the war, and the consequent need for loyalty to traditional Judaism. David’s Jewish identity is also at odds with his own concealed gay identity, and he has a passionate affair with handsome bartender Bruno (Alex Hurt) who is angry at David’s ignorance of the Aids crisis.
Steel brings a very distinctive kind of control and restraint to his film, both in terms of its subdued colour palette and an emotional language which despite explicit scenes of both sex and homophobic tension and paranoia, has something opaque and elliptical about it. The film however concludes with that now quaint rarity: the freeze-frame shot, which seems to belong to a lighter, more quizzically humorous film. Levine brings an assertive and intelligent performance. • Minyan is released on 7 January in cinemas.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/minyan-review-passion-and-paranoia-in-gay-jewish-identity-drama
5836;5836;Recipe for contentment: cook and take life one meal at a time;2022-01-03T12:00:45Z;['Tim Adams'];['Food', 'Hobbies', 'Simon Hopkinson', 'Life and style', 'Baking', 'Family', 'Coronavirus', 'Mindfulness'];"I used to fancy myself as a special occasion cook, marinating and reducing for occasional wows, but since lockdown I’ve mostly taken over – with as little control freakery as I can muster – doing my full share of proper family meals, well. Does that count as a hobby? Of course not. But when you are writing and reading and wandering and watching for a living, it can feel that all of life is a form of solitary indulgence, so the distractions I crave are generally communal, and simply hands on. That feeling has become more urgent in the last two years. Having worked from home for a couple of decades, I was used to mostly being alone with the contents of the fridge. Now, there were four of us in the house, Zooming and essay-writing and being lectured online and the days seemed to demand different kinds of punctuation marks. A few things conspired to make that effort seem more of an adventure than a chore. For quite a few of those weeks and months, in and out of bubbles, we were joined by my daughter’s boyfriend, James, who is vegetarian. It seemed a good time for us all to cut out meat, so that happily concentrated our minds, too: how do we create flavour and variety without the fallback of a slab of protein? (Most of the best answers I found were inevitably plagiarised from Anna Jones or Ottolenghi or Mr Slater.) Then there was the question of supply. I stopped going to supermarkets entirely and got to know the strengths and weaknesses of local greengrocers – my 10,000 steps were usually directed towards a mission for tarragon or Swiss chard. And then, I guess, mental health. The real challenge of a life of blank pages to be filled on screens has always been, for me, how to negotiate that early evening switch over to not thinking all the time about filling blank pages on screens. Suddenly, in the absence of the prospect of ever going out, chopping herbs and crushing garlic and rolling pastry seemed like a far better strategy for that gear shift than just opening another bottle of wine (though that often happened, too).
I realise, writing this, that for many people, particularly from and in countries and cultures where food preparation is indistinguishable from the regular flow of life, the idea of cooking as a brand new hobby might seem somewhat perverse or nonsensical. But, in small ways, ludicrously late, I’ve found that the new habit of starting the day discussing what’s for lunch or what’s for supper and then later doing those things, together or alone, the best you possibly can, alters the balance of how you think about any of the day’s challenges. We are forever fed the lie that our psychological ease lies in greater convenience, speed, the avoidance of complication and difficulty; that life is a battle for me-time; that work is the enemy and leisure the goal. It almost goes without saying that those ideas empty out life rather than fill it, and miss the texture of what makes most days worth living: doing things as slowly and well as they demand (even if it’s only making a great omelette), mastering skills for their own sake, searching for tomatoes that taste like tomatoes. Over the years, I’ve been lucky enough to meet or write about a few people for whom that speed of life has been second nature. More often than not they have been people who have learned to pace themselves by the rhythm of days and seasons, rather than trying to force time to their own will. I once spent a few days staying in the Provençal house owned by Richard Olney, author of The French Menu Cookbook, who was instrumental in reminding western cooks that food was all about rootedness. Or I think of Simon Hopkinson, formerly chef at Hilaire and Bibendum, whose eyes lit up when he described the thrill of finding mackerel at the market that morning so fresh they were still a little curled, and going home to cook them. If there had been a rulebook to make the last couple of years a bit more bearable it would, for me, certainly have involved Hopkinson’s mantra from his Roast Chicken and Other Stories: “It is important to cook in the right frame of mind (we are not talking everyday chores here) and to do things in the right order. Ergo: feel hungry; go out shopping with pen and paper and money. See good things, buy them. Write down further items that will accompany previous purchases. Come home. Have a glass of wine. Cook the food and eat.”
If I’m honest, the first two entries on that list have always presented the biggest challenge for me. While envying a little the joy people like Hopkinson found in mastery, I realise I’ve tended to accept that such commitment might be beyond me. I had a powerful feeling growing up, I think, that, in contrast to the men of my dad’s generation, I would always be a corner-cutter, a bit slap-dash when it came to practical tasks, a DIY bodger, a dabbler rather than a perfectionist. One of the things that cooking has taught me in recent months is that those kinds of self-images can perhaps, even in your (sometimes terrifyingly) advancing 50s, be unlearned and rewritten. Sometimes, late at night, as I go round turning the lights off in the house, or loading the dishwasher, I find myself totting up the day just ended, in the manner of Ronnie Barker, as he used to shut up shop in Open All Hours. Just lately, it’s been good to have a few new phrases entering that internal voiceover, along with the tally of uncompleted tasks and worries to sleep on – “that watercress sauce, wasn’t half bad, was it?” or “next time, I think, a little less cinnamon in those poached pears”.

5837;5837;UK Covid test distributor shut for Christmas after receiving 2.5m kits;2022-01-03T11:48:34Z;['Jamie Grierson'];['Coronavirus', 'Pharmaceuticals industry', 'Omicron variant', 'Health', 'Health policy', 'Society', 'UK news'];"The sole distributor of Covid lateral flow tests (LFTs) to pharmacies closed for four days over the Christmas period just as it received a delivery of 2.5m devices, it has emerged. Alliance Healthcare took delivery of the tests on Christmas Eve and then shut, the Times reported. It provides LFTs to pharmacies to give out to the public. An update from the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, which represents NHS pharmacy contractors, confirmed 2.5m tests had been delivered to Alliance Healthcare on 24 December and added: “That stock was ready to be delivered [on] 29 December when Alliance Healthcare reopened after its planned Christmas break, and it represents circa 357,000 individual packs of seven tests and just over 6,000 cartons.” Each pharmacy is able to place a daily order for a single carton, containing about 55 packs, each with seven tests, but the surge in Omicron variant cases, guidance to increase the amount of testing and a change to the isolation rules have led to an increase in demand.
People are able to leave Covid isolation early after testing negative, and school pupils are being encouraged to test at least twice weekly when they return to classrooms this week. This has led many pharmacies to run out within hours of delivery, and there were reports of patchy supplies before Christmas. Alliance Healthcare said last week there could be “some service disruption across the Alliance Healthcare network” due to Covid-related absence. The company has been approached by the Guardian but a UK spokesperson told the Times it had closed on 25 December until 28 December, and distribution had resumed on 29 December “when the majority of community pharmacies reopened”. He said: “Since the start of the pharmacy collect scheme, Alliance Healthcare UK has distributed over 280m lateral flow tests to community pharmacies across the UK. We distributed more than 2m lateral flow tests on Christmas Eve to support a number of community pharmacies that remained open over Christmas bank holiday and where stock was available. “We continue to distribute around 2m lateral flow tests daily from stock made available to us from UKHSA.” A UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) spokesperson said: “The UK’s testing programme is the biggest in Europe, with almost 400m tests carried out since the start of the pandemic. We are delivering record numbers of lateral flow tests to pharmacies across the country, with over 8m test kits being made available to pharmacies between 29 December and New Year’s Eve. “We have made 100,000 more PCR [polymerase chain reaction test] booking slots available per day since mid-December and we are continuing to rapidly expand capacity – with over half a million tests carried out on 23 December alone and delivery capacity doubled to 900,000 PCR and LFD [lateral flow device] test kits a day. If you have not been able to get the test you need from gov.uk, please keep checking every few hours as more PCR and LFD tests become available every day.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/uk-covid-test-distributor-shut-christmas-25m-kits
5838;5838;Author says memoir of communist Albania met with ‘vicious’ abuse;2022-01-03T11:41:47Z;['Matthew Weaver'];['Communism', 'Albania', 'Books', 'Autobiography and memoir', 'Biography books', 'Europe', 'World news'];"A memoir about growing up before and after the fall of communism in Albania has won rave reviews in the west but has prompted “vicious” abuse from a vocal minority of Albanians, its author says. Free by Lea Ypi, a Marxist Albanian professor of political theory at the London School of Economics, might seem an unlikely bestseller. But in its first full month on sale in November the memoir sold 10,000 copies. It has been shortlisted for the Costa biography of the year and will soon be available in 17 languages including Korean and Mandarin. Despite its criticisms of the disastrous impact of market changes in Albania, the book received five-star reviews in the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, and was named the Sunday Times book of the year. But in Albania the book generated such a torrent of online abuse that Ypi had to appeal to Albanians to stop sending her “offensive, accusatory and defamatory” messages. She told the Guardian she usually enjoyed engaging with her detractors. But she said this abuse was different because it came from people who had either not read the book or misunderstood its criticism of capitalism and communism. The book is told from her perspective as a child in 1980s Albania, when she was taught to worship the dictator Enver Hoxha, and her family’s dissident views became clear only after the regime fell.
“One of the most important messages in the book is that however oppressive a regime, it never completely crushes human dignity,” she said. Some of Ypi’s Albanian critics have mistaken such ideas as an apology for communism and have accused her of experiencing Stockholm syndrome. This has been particularly hard for Ypi to take. “It touches you personally if you have a grandfather who spent 15 years in a communist prison to be told you are somehow trying to rehabilitate communist murderers,” she said. Some of the reaction has been sexist – in one message Ypi was told she looked “more like a showgirl than an academic”. Another dredged up an old newspaper cutting that quoted Ypi as an 11-year-old expressing a desire to help her country, and accused her of turning against her former self. She said: “It’s a minority but it’s so vocal and so personal and so vicious, it affects you a lot more than the other responses which have been overwhelmingly positive.” In the book, she recounts being bullied as a child in part because she spoke French. “It’s exactly the same kind of people who were bullying me when I was a child that are doing it now,” she said. Ypi says much of the criticism came after she launched the Albanian version of the book at Hoxha’s former house in the capital, Tirana. “For me it was like imagining Hoxha in hell, having someone from a family of dissidents promote a book about the Albanian legacy. It was symbolically really powerful,” she said. But the irony of the location was lost on some, who feel the property should be destroyed and suspected Ypi of trying to rehabilitate the dictator. The presence at the launch of the Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, and many of his ministers was also misconstrued. Ypi said: “I’m very critical of the Albanian government, but people felt I was being manipulated or appropriated by them.” Such perceptions have even fuelled false rumours that Ypi is to become the next president of Albania. She said: “If you keep repeating fake news like that it almost becomes like real news. And then it erodes constructive criticism. What should happen to Enver Hoxha’s house is a valid debate, but if you start basing it on fake news and misreadings the debate never happens.” Ypi, who wrote the book in parallel in English and Albanian, feels that for all the negative online comments, the book has succeeded in sparking constructive discussions about the merits of socialism and capitalism. She said: “Through family histories I try to engage everyone in a big conversation about freedom – my mother has one idea of freedom and my father has another. When it works it opens up big conversations not shuts them down. And there’s a younger generation who are concerned about what kind of system we live in.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/author-memoir-communist-albania-met-vicious-abuse-lea-ypi

5840;5840;Workers across the US are rising up. Can they turn their anger into a movement? | Steven Greenhouse;2022-01-03T11:15:44Z;['Steven Greenhouse'];['US unions', 'US news', 'World news', 'US politics'];"Throughout 2021, American workers stood up and fought back to an unusual degree. Workers went on strike at Kellogg’s, Nabisco, John Deere, Columbia University and numerous hospitals, while non-union “essential” workers – furious about how they’ve been treated – walked out at supermarkets, warehouses and fast-food restaurants. Workers have sought to unionize at Starbucks, Amazon, even the Art Institute of Chicago. And a record number of Americans have been quitting their jobs each month, more than 4 million monthly, fed up and eager for something better. Millions of workers are angry – angry that they didn’t get hazard pay for risking their lives during the pandemic, angry that they’ve been forced to work 70 or 80 hours a week, angry that they received puny raises while executive pay soared, angry that they didn’t get paid sick days when they got sick.
Out of this comes a question that looms large for America’s workers: will this surge of worker action and anger be a mere flash in the pan or will it be part of a longer-lasting phenomenon? The answer to this important question could turn on whether all this anger and energy are somehow transformed into a larger movement. At least for now, America’s labor leaders seem to be doing very little to tap all this energy and hope and to build it into something bigger and longer lasting. Yes, we are seeing unionization drives at this workplace and that one, but we are not seeing any bigger, broader effort to channel and transform all this worker energy and discontent into a new movement, one perhaps with millions of engaged and energetic nonunion workers, that would work in conjunction with the traditional union movement. Worker advocates I speak to keep wondering: what are labor leaders waiting for? If not now, when? In Joe Biden, we have the most pro-union president since Franklin Roosevelt, and public approval for unions is the highest it’s been in more than a half century. For decades, union leaders have said they are eager to reverse labor’s long decline – more than 20% of workers were in unions three decades ago, now just 10% are. Unless unions step up and do something bold, they’ll relegate themselves to continued decline. Many labor leaders evidently think it’s impossible or improbable to turn this year’s energy and anger into a new movement or a big, new group. But building a movement from scratch isn’t impossible. 350.org was founded in 2008 by several college students and environmentalist author Bill McKibben, and within two years, it organized a mammoth Day of Climate Action with a reported 5,245 actions in 181 countries. After the horrific shootings at Marjorie Stoneman high school in Florida in 2018, a handful of students founded March for Our Lives, and within five weeks, their group had organized nationwide rallies with hundreds of thousands of people calling for gun control. Black Lives Matter also grew into a powerful national movement within a few years. None of these movements were one-shot or one-month affairs – they have become powers to contend with in policy and politics. So why isn’t the labor movement seizing on this year’s burst of worker energy to build something bigger? I was discussing this with friend who is a professor of labor studies, and she said she thought that most of today’s union leaders were “constitutionally incapable” of building big or being bold and ambitious. She said that after decades of being on the defensive, of being beaten down by hostile corporations, hostile GOP lawmakers and hostile judicial decisions, many labor leaders seem unable to dream big or think outside the box on how to attract large numbers of workers in ways beyond the traditional one-workplace-at-a-time union drives. But building big and outside the box isn’t impossible for labor. Just look at the Fight for $15. The strategists and SEIU leaders behind it had a vision: they wanted to push the issue of low wages into the national conversation and lift the pay floor for millions of workers. They started small, with walkouts by 200 workers at a dozen fast-food restaurants in New York City, and within two years, they built a powerful national movement that held strikes and protests in hundreds of cities. This movement ultimately got a dozen states to enact a $15 minimum wage, lifting pay for over 20 million workers. Perhaps some brilliant, visionary workers or worker advocates will step forward to seek to channel this year’s burst of worker anger and energy into a new movement. Social media could certainly help build it, perhaps with the assistance of groups like Coworker.org, which has considerable experience engaging and mobilizing disgruntled rank-and-file workers via the internet.
For many workers, a big new group or movement could be a waystation toward unionizing: helping educate and mobilize workers to unionize, guiding them on next steps and what their rights are, and promising a pool of ready support if they seek to unionize. This new group or movement could send out bulletins telling members how they could help other workers in their community or nearby communities – perhaps help unionization drives at Amazon or Starbucks or strikers at Kellogg’s or Warrior Met Coal in Alabama or food delivery workers who are cheated out of tips and don’t have access to bathrooms. Members of this new group could be called on to protest outside the offices of members of Congress or state lawmakers about myriad issues, perhaps raising the federal minimum wage or enacting paid family leave or the Protecting the Right to Organize Act. Or they could join rallies for voting rights or immigrant rights or against police abuses or to combat global warming. Working America, an arm of the AFL-CIO, does some of this, mainly urging its members to vote and to contact lawmakers. To truly help reverse labor’s decline and capitalize on today’s worker anger, much more will be needed – an organization that is far more connected to workers and does far more organizing, protesting and mobilizing. America’s labor movement is terribly balkanized, with many unions engaged in turf battles and upset that another union has (perhaps) stepped into its territory. As a result, they too often find it hard to work together. But if America’s unions are serious about wanting to strengthen worker power and reverse labor’s decline, it’s time to put past divisions behind them and figure out how to build back something bigger. There are three main reasons that America’s labor movement has declined: first, corporate America’s fierce resistance to unions, second, the decades-long slide in factory jobs, and, third, the Republican party’s decades-long fight to weaken unions and make it tougher to unionize. But there’s another factor behind labor’s decline that is rarely discussed – many labor leaders don’t do nearly enough to inspire workers and expand the union movement. Today’s workers could use some vigorous, visionary leaders like Mother Jones, Sidney Hillman, John L Lewis and A Philip Randolph to lead and inspire, and build something bigger. Perhaps many union leaders haven’t been hearing what I often hear from rank-and-file union members: “Lead or get out of the way.” Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labor and the workplace.

5841;5841;Rachel Roddy’s recipe for lentils, roast grapes and goat’s cheese | A kitchen in Rome;2022-01-03T11:00:45Z;['Rachel Roddy'];['Food', 'Italian food and drink', 'Fruit', 'Cheese', 'Vegetables'];"It was fascinating to see lentils growing on low plants, protected by bean-sized green pods. We were in a field in the middle of Sicily, and there were chickpeas growing, too, also in neat green jackets, and in the next field wheat. It was June and the sun was high and hot, but it had rained the night before, so our ankles were warmed by steam. We had been told to wear sensible shoes, and I was wearing clogs; sensible, but not in a field. So while I tried to listen to Francesco Di Gesu explain how the lentils grown on his land would be harvested, thrashed and dried, I was distracted by the way my feet were collecting the clay earth. Not a normal amount, but massive, ever-increasing clumps, which made my legs look like uprooted tree trunks and walking harder and harder, until eventually I lost one and got stuck in the other; part stork, part adult version of a childhood game. After pointing and laughing, someone came to my aid and we used a stick to lever off some earth; I managed to stomp off more on the way to the van. Later, back where we had come from, I sat and scraped away the rest of the now dry mud, and with it dozens of lentils, a memory now relived every time I tip a bag of them into a pan and cover with water. You are, most likely, reading this in early January, so happy new year. Maybe you ate lentils last night, their coin shape an augury of wealth and happiness for this coming year. Or maybe you ate a grape every time the clock struck or iPhone beeped down to midnight – that, too, is said to ensure a secure and comfortable tomorrow. If you didn’t, here is a recipe that includes both, about which I can’t promise anything (although I am always optimistic), except for its goodness. Most of the time I braise lentils, cooking them in just enough water that by the end it is almost completely absorbed and the final consistency soft. For this dish, however, while the lentils should be completely cooked and tender, I don’t want them to collapse, so I boil them in well-seasoned water, then drain. The cooking time of lentils depends on their variety, and on how old they are and how they have been stored, so, as always, keep tasting. This is a recipe that lends itself to variations. The cheese could be replaced with hard-boiled eggs and anchovy fillets, sausages or roast red peppers. That said, I do suggest trying it with the goat’s cheese – its creamy sharpness is terrific with the sweet-earthy lentils. Most herbs can be stirred into warm lentils, as can lightly toasted cumin seeds or crushed coriander; you could even stir in a handful of cooked chestnuts, toasted hazelnuts or ribbons of radicchio. Or spoon the lentils on radicchio leaf-boats, ready to sail into 2022. Lentils, roast grapes and goat’s cheese Serves 4 350g small brown or puy lentils 2 bay leaves 1 garlic clove, unpeeled 1 stick celery Salt and back pepper 200g small red grapes Olive oil A few marjoram sprigs 4 small goat’s cheese (60-80g each) 1 tsp red-wine vinegar 1 tbsp chopped parsley Put the lentils, bay, garlic, celery and a pinch of salt in a pan, cover with one and a half litres of water, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape. While the lentils are cooking, put the grapes on a small baking tray, pour over some oil, sprinkle with salt, add the marjoram, and toss. Bake at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 20 minutes, until soft and blistered, then pull from oven, put the cheese on top and return to the oven for five minutes, until the cheese is warm. Drain the lentils, then put them in a bowl and toss with three tablespoons olive oil, salt, lots of black pepper, the red-wine vinegar and parsley. Share the lentils between four plates and top each serving with some of the grapes and a cheese.";https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/03/rachel-roddy-recipe-lentils-roast-grapes-goats-cheese
5842;5842;‘I’ll never leave your side’: his father’s letters helped him endure 19 years in prison;2022-01-03T11:00:44Z;['N/A'];['Race', 'US prisons', 'US news'];"As Shaka Senghor was serving 19 years in prison for murder, a letter from his father gave him the strength to endure and eventually reform. “I’ll never leave your side,” Senghor’s father wrote to him, after Senghor told his family, in a letter written from solitary confinement, that they should move on with their lives without him. Senghor explored his road to redemption in his New York Times best-seller Writing My Wrongs: Life, Death, and Redemption in an American Prison. At 19, Senghor was convicted of second degree murder after shooting a man during a drug deal in Detroit. He was released from prison in 2010 and since then has been a MIT Media Lab Director’s Fellow, delivered a TED Talk in 2016 that has collected more than 1.6m views and been featured on Oprah Winfrey’s SuperSoul 100. Now, in his second book titled Letters to the Sons of Society, which will be published later this month, Senghor has written a collection of letters to his two sons: Jay, who was born while he was in prison, with whom he had a distant and fractured relationship, and his younger charge, Sekou, who was born to a wiser, redeemed Senghor who was able to be a present and attentive father. In his book, Senghor, 49, wrestles with reconciling and building a relationship with his adult son who first knew him as an inmate, and his second child, born of a different mother, who is being raised by an accomplished and liberated man. Senghor grapples with his regret over missing out on so much of his eldest son’s life, battles with his own toxic ideas of masculinity and ultimately works to find a way to love both his children and engage in their lives authentically. Letters played a big role in your own redemption and transformation. Why did you decide to write this book in the form of letters versus other narrative styles? My transformation really started with letters from my dad. He is a beautiful letter writer and he would write me five to six page handwritten letters about life. We did a lot of healing and growing together and challenging ideas through our letters. And in my toughest moments in prison, I would go back and reread his letters as a reminder that there was someone on the other side of the four walls who really cared about me. Someone who loved me, loved me unconditionally. Through our letters, we were able to really be honest and very transparent with each other. He could admit the areas where he felt he came up short and I could accept my failures and be accountable and free him from the oppressive thought that it was his fault I landed in prison. I felt like the intimacy of the letters between my dad and I were something we just don’t see: an honest and emotional exchange between Black men. I thought, if I could ever write something to my sons that they could go back to, the way I went back to the letters with my dad, their lives would be good. You wrote Letters during a nine month period in 2020, during the pandemic constraints and a moment of racial uprisings and reckonings. How did that timing influence your approach? When I began to put the letters together, it was before the social unrest we witnessed globally. When I put my first proposal together, it was in late 2019, I was thinking about the narrative around Black men and this negative story that kept being told. We’re framed like we are America’s problem; we’re the Black community’s problem; we’re Black women’s problems; we’re everybody’s problem and nobody’s solution. It really bothered me because I know so many incredible Black men. Originally the letters were going to be addressed to different sons: my hip-hop sons, my non-binary confirming sons, my entrepreneurial sons. Then as I thought about it, I thought, “I need to write these letters to my sons because between these two worlds are the many sons I encounter.” Your oldest son, Jay, is 29 and your youngest, Sekou, is 10. How have they responded to what you’ve written? Jay does not want to read the book. He is so nonchalant and in his own world. I realized that I can’t insert myself into his life in a way that he hasn’t given me permission to do. So I make the offering, and whatever he chooses to do, I’m cool with. With Sekou, it’s different because some of the content is more mature than where he is at. He did read some and had the best reaction ever. He was so amused that my dad once bought me some fake Jordan (sneakers). He was just like, “Not the Pro Wings.” It was a special moment. Do you see this book as a parenting guide for Black boys? Or do you expect it to have a wider resonance? This is a book that white fathers and sons should consume, too. Oftentimes they are in those positions that are systemically oppressive to people who don’t look like them. It’s really important for white dads to understand that Black fathers want the same things for their sons: safety, well-being, the ability to thrive and not just survive. The biggest thing I want (all) to take away is the power of love – the emotional accessibility that we owe ourselves and owe our sons and how impactful it is when you can open up. Love is truly our power and is the source of all things great. You wrote a letter unpacking isolation and you draw a parallel between being in solitary confinement in prison and the isolation of the early days of the pandemic. What took you there? When the global pandemic first began and people started going into lockdown, I saw a lot of people struggling. Whenever people would reach out to me, they’d say I feel bad because you dealt with real isolation going through solitary confinement. And I’d say: “No, this is real. There is not a comparison to make, but there are similar themes.” In solitary what really challenges you is this indefinite sense of not knowing. There’s never a concrete time frame of when you’ll be out. It was the same with this pandemic – we don’t know when we are coming out of it. The depression that set in for many people was familiar territory to me. I remember one day, I was in my office and was getting off my fifth Zoom meeting. I had ordered food in. I felt a sense of the room closing in on me. I realized I was triggered and my mind had gone back to a previous experience – my prison experience. It felt just like when they would bring your food to the cell. And this is where you’ll be and you can’t go anywhere. And so I had to leave, to remember, I can get out of here. Isolation happens in many forms. You spent about seven years combined in solitary confinement for various reasons and during that time found meditation, discipline and hope. I remember writing to my dad and telling him I think I’m going to die in this place and they are never going to let me out. I want you to go on with your life and take care of Jay and the family. I wrote him an honest letter because I thought my life was over and I didn’t want to see him suffer as a result of my suffering. My dad wrote me back and told me that while he wished I wasn’t in solitary confinement he had no judgment. He told me that no matter how long I was in prison he wouldn’t leave my side and would always have my back. I read the letter so many times because it affirmed me and kept me strong on so many days. You write about trauma, abuse, alcohol and drug addiction, among other serious topics. Why did you want to broach these issues with your still young sons? Prison is designed to lay you bare. It dehumanizes you in such a way and it strips you. Once you reconcile that, you can live with any truth. There are conversations that our community does not have with children. There is this old model … and we tiptoe around a lot of topics. I’m a parent, a dad and I mentor kids all over the country. I go into these schools and these 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, they are watching everything on social media. Their conversations are hyper-mature but in a very toxic way. My responsibility is to empower my sons with my truth and that truth comes through my own vulnerability. Because I have a public life and I’ve been convicted of a very serious crime … kids could say things to my youngest son. I had a fear that someone could say to him, “your dad is a murderer”, without him having any context it would hurt him. So for me, the responsible thing to do is to speak the truth. I want to be real with both of them. [They] already know the worst thing I’ve done in my life. So for me, the rest of the topics are not hard conversations to have. What does a whole Black boy look like to you? When I think of a whole Black boy the first thing that comes to mind is an image of Sekou dancing to old-school soul music. I imagine a boy who is full of joy and that is able to explore the world with curiosity and be unimpeded in his quest to learn, to have fun, to contribute, to have agency over his body and thoughts. To be able to give love and receive love without it being filtered through a lens of trauma or skepticism. To really smile freely, smile in a way that makes other people smile when they walk in the room. Somebody that can express themselves and has full access to their emotions. There’s nothing more beautiful than when my son comes up to me and says he needs a hug. He’s so funny to me – he says: “Dad bring it in, bring it in.” That freedom of emotional access, that is wholeness to me.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/shaka-senghor-letters-sons
5843;5843;Original caretakers: Indigenous groups team up with conservationists to protect swaths of US ;2022-01-03T11:00:44Z;['Hallie Golden'];['Washington state', 'US news', 'Indigenous peoples'];"In 2020, an environmental non-profit returned over a dozen acres in Oregon to the Clatsop-Nehalem Confederated Tribes. Two months later, a conservation group worked with the Esselen Tribe of Monterey county to return more than 1,000 acres in California to the tribal group. And then late last year, in one of the largest transfers of its kind, an environmental organization returned thousands of acres of wildlife rangeland in Washington state to the Colville Tribes. Although each agreement was distinct, in recent years an important pattern has emerged of conservationists and Indigenous people working together by way of land transfers. The effect has been twofold: protecting ecologically vital spaces while helping to right historic injustices by returning properties to their original caretakers. The Colville Tribes agreement in October transferred about 9,243 acres of arid grasslands, dotted with sagebrush, that encompass several canyons in north-central Washington state that are valued by biologists as an important corridor linking the Cascade mountain range to the Rocky mountains for lynx, wolverine, wolves and grizzly bears. It was traditional territory of the Okanagan Tribe, a First Nations and Native American people who spanned across the Canada-US border, and it was part of the original Colville Tribes’ reservation that was stripped away by the federal government in 1892 after gold was discovered. In recent decades, it has been used as a family ranch. But then when it emerged in a few years ago that the land would be put up for sale, the environmental non-profit Conservation Northwest attempted to get it into the hands of a buyer who would preserve it. However, according to the non-profit’s executive director, Mitch Friedman, these efforts were at first unsuccessful. Toward the end of last year the land’s ecological and historical elements seemed to align perfectly when tribal officials and the non-profit’s leaders worked to return it to the hands of the Colville Tribes. “It was, I would say, the best kind of news that we could receive, to get land back,” said Andy Joseph Jr, chair of the Colville Business Council, who described stepping back on to the land in late October for a ceremony as a feeling of returning home. The community, which consists of 12 bands, is known for its substantial natural resources departments and had previously worked closely with Conservation Northwest, most recently to relocate threatened Canada lynx on the reservation. In early October, after Conservation Northwest raised about $4.6m in eight months to buy the property, and the tribe approved a protective covenant that outlined protections on the land, the group immediately transferred the land’s deed to the Colville Tribes. Preserving biodiversity Although Indigenous peoples make up only about 5% of the world’s population, their territories encompass 80% of global biodiversity, according to the 2020 report The Indigenous World. And nature on Indigenous peoples’ lands is “generally declining less rapidly” than other land, according to a 2019 report by the Intergovernmental Science – Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Today, it’s clear conservationists have been looking to traditional ecological knowledge in their work. At the same time, environmental organizations and tribes have been coming together to protect the natural world, and a crucial part of this teamwork has been land transfers. In September, the Nature Conservancy transferred the 132-acre Safe Harbor Marsh Preserve along the west shore of Flathead Lake in Montana to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. The Indigenous community has a large natural resources department and developed a strong relationship with the environmental organization. They also have a long history with the preserve. Once a part of the tribe’s reservation, the marsh had been lost, along with thousands of other acres, through a pair of federal allotment acts in the early 1900s. Chairwoman Shelly Fyant said the tribes had made it a point to buy these properties back, but faced challenges with skyrocketing costs. She said they were extremely happy when the Nature Conservancy leaders approached them about the marsh. “It’s just so amazing and, you know, really heartwarming that we have allies that understand us. They understand what our goals are, you know, in the big picture,” she said. “It’s not about money; it’s not about making a profit or capitalism or development. It’s about conserving it for future generations, so that our descendants can enjoy that.” The tribe passed a resolution specifying that the site will be dedicated to conservation, wildlife and cultural uses. Fyant explained that they’re working to integrate it into their management plan and to preserve the marsh for the waterfowl and other migratory birds. But at the same time, tribes are in no way a monolithic group. And there have been instances of Indigenous communities’ work running afoul of conservation efforts. The Navajo Nation Council, for example, recently spoke out in opposition of the Biden administration’s proposed ban on oil and gas drilling around Chaco Canyon. At the same time, the Makah Tribe has spent years working to regain its whaling rights, which has put them at odds with several conservation groups. Jill Sherman-Warne, executive director of the Native American Environmental Protection Coalition and former elected official of the Hoopa Valley Tribe, explained that given all the ignored treaties and other agreements cast aside, tribes have been left to take care of themselves. And in some cases that may mean logging, gaming, tourism or other practices that don’t necessarily align with conservation. But overall, she said, tribes are incredibly effective protectors of the natural world. “Tribal people have in their histories knowledge that before geologists or hydrologists can prove scientific fact,” she said. “Tribes have stories about the environment that existed before any of the science, which now is proving their oral histories to be true.” Serra Hoagland, a biologist and tribal liaison for the US Forest Service, said that traditional ecological knowledge and western science can complement each other very well. Citing a 2012 Journal of Forestry study, she said that while western science tends to be more concrete and look in short time periods, traditional knowledge is often more abstract and looks in longer time periods. “You commonly hear throughout Indian Country, tribes and Native people talking about the seventh generation,” said Hoagland, a member of Pueblo of Laguna. “And that’s because we’re thinking that far ahead into the future about our decisions that we’re making today.” Conservation plan Officials within the Confederated Tribes of the Colville reservation have started putting together a conservation management plan guided by traditional knowledge and western science for the recently returned land. Cody Desautel, natural resources division director for the Colville Tribes, said the process will probably take about six months and involve examining the species on the property, the condition of the land and the types of improvements that may need to be made. One of the species he said he anticipates will be a priority is the endangered sharp-tailed grouse, which are known to have breeding grounds on the land. The Colville Tribes also plans to conduct a cultural plant inventory to identify those culturally significant to the tribe. They may also be seeing two additional pieces of land returned in the coming months. The Methow Conservancy recently bought more than 300 acres and has announced its plans to give it to the tribe. And after Conservation Northwest was able to raise about $300,000 over the amount needed for the previously returned land, they plan to help the tribe with closing costs on another property within that same corridor. Chairman Joseph said given the importance of returning land and their shared caretaking goals, he hopes to see others follow suit. He said that it is their traditional and cultural belief that “as long as we take care of the land, the animals, the foods, the medicines and the water, they’ll always be here for us. “It seems like the conservationists feel the same way.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/original-caretakers-indigenous-groups-team-up-with-conservationists-to-protect-swaths-of-us
5844;5844;Lukaku issue looms large but Chelsea are really suffering for loss of control | Jonathan Wilson;2022-01-03T11:00:44Z;['Jonathan Wilson'];['Chelsea', 'Thomas Tuchel', 'Romelu Lukaku', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Thomas Tuchel used to be about control. When he arrived at Chelsea a year ago, that was what he brought: suddenly a team that had been desperately vulnerable on the break stopped conceding on the counter. They held the ball and a 3-4-2-1 formation gave them a naturally solid structure with two midfielders stationed in front of the defensive line. They won the Champions League because they demonstrated how it was possible to play pressing football without leaving yourself open in transition. That had always been Manchester City’s issue, less in the Premier League (although Leicester have often troubled them, as they did last week even in conceding six) than against top European sides. They were a remorseless attacking force, as imposing as the Death Star, but they also had that fatal exhaust port that meant they could be destroyed. To an extent that is intrinsic to the philosophy: push high and there will be space behind the defensive line; the question was how to guard against balls played into that space without losing the aggression of the press.
City have clearly worked on that. Even in possession they often have five men behind the ball. They are more measured in their approach than they were when Pep Guardiola first arrived in England. But it was Tuchel’s Chelsea who seemed to have found the balance, beating City three times in the final seven weeks of the season, including in the FA Cup semi-final and the Champions League final. But while City march on, only 10 points dropped in the league this season, Chelsea have lost that sense of control. Having conceded four goals in their first 12 league games, they’ve leaked 12 in the past nine, with only one clean sheet. Their form has been far from disastrous: they have lost only one of those games, but equally they have won only three. And as so often, once the rot sets in, it spreads rapidly. Romelu Lukaku, having suggested he was unhappy with the 3-4-2-1 to which Tuchel has returned, will have further talks with the management on Monday. That is significant not only because he cost £97.5m and ideally would not be talking about how he pines for Inter eight league starts after leaving them, but because he seemed the solution to the slight toothlessness that was the only real doubt towards the end of last season. Not only is he a habitual goalscorer – only once in the past 12 seasons has he failed to get into double figures – but he is a player whose movement seemed ideal for Chelsea: why wouldn’t the same drift out to the right to create space for Kevin De Bruyne that has worked so well for Belgium work also with Chelsea’s inside-forwards? But as he has struggled to make an impact, so Chelsea’s entire forward line has come under scrutiny: £71m for Kai Havertz, £58m for Christian Pulisic, £47.5m for Timo Werner, £34m for Hakim Ziyech … some have suffered injury or illness and some or all may yet come good, but that’s £308m on five players over two and half seasons, none of whom could be said to have been a resounding success. Chelsea’s leading scorer in the league last season was Jorginho; this season it is Mason Mount.
Tuchel arrived with a reputation for prickliness, as somebody with a tendency to fall out with players, directors and journalists eventually, but for most of the past year has been drily charming. Only in the last weeks has that begun to change, the Lukaku interview and its fallout the first sign of tension with his squad. Resolving that situation feels vital, not only because Chelsea need a Lukaku figure scoring goals and leading the line, but because the history of Chelsea managers who cannot accommodate big signings is not good. But everything, ultimately, comes back to that loss of control. It didn’t matter that Chelsea’s wing‑backs had scored more than their forwards when they were keeping clean sheets; the grumbling of a high-profile player matters less when you are winning games. The loss of Mateo Kovacic, first to a hamstring injury and then to Covid, has been hugely costly: Chelsea have conceded only four goals in his 10 league starts this season and three of those have come in the past two games when, Tuchel has acknowledged, he was rushed back. His absence, and N’Golo Kanté’s ongoing struggles with a knee injury, have increased the pressure on Jorginho, who has at times looked weary, notably in the defeat at West Ham. The deadline-day loan signing of Saúl Ñíguez, who has managed a total of 164 league minutes for Chelsea, has not worked out, and Ross Barkley, 154 league minutes this season, surely has no future at the club.
Injuries have also played havoc in the back five, with Reece James and Ben Chilwell particular losses. But there is also self-inflicted uncertainty, with Antonio Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen out of contract in the summer and Thiago Silva finally agreeing an extension on Monday. After announcing losses of £145.6m last week, a squad that last season seemed vibrant, ready for years of domination, has come to look fragile. Which just goes to show how rapidly things can spin out of control. The loss of the attribute that defined Chelsea in the second half of last season is now threatening to undermine the whole project. Sorting out Lukaku may be the priority, but Chelsea also have to get that sense of control back.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/romelu-lukaku-issue-chelsea-suffering-loss-of-control-thomas-tuchel
5845;5845;Ukraine’s culture minister blasts Emily in Paris over ‘unacceptable’ stereotype;2022-01-03T10:58:30Z;['Kate Abbott'];['Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Lily Collins', 'Ukraine', 'Europe', 'Netflix'];"Ukraine’s culture minister Oleksandr Tkachenko has issued a complaint to Netflix over its offensive stereotypical image of a Ukrainian character in its show Emily in Paris. In a Telegram post, Tkachenko wrote: “We have a caricature image of a Ukrainian woman that is unacceptable. It is also insulting. Is that how Ukrainians are seen abroad?”
Media in Ukraine confirmed that he has sent a letter to the streaming giant to complain about the portrayal of Petra, played by actor Daria Panchenko, who is terrified of being deported in the show, shoplifts while on a shopping spree with Emily and has bad fashion sense – the ultimate faux pas in this appearance-obsessed world. Emily in Paris is about the titular American, played by Lily Collins, who moves to the city of light to work for a marketing firm and swiftly becomes an influencer. This is far from the first time the show has been blasted for cliched and stereotypical depictions – in fact, it has become renowned for its beret-wearing, chain-smoking and philandering French characters. The Guardian review of its debut series declared it “astonishingly tone-deaf”, adding: “You name a stereotype, and within the first three episodes, Emily has not only encountered it, but tried to rectify it, to adjust it to the American way.”
French critic Charles Martin, who writes for Première, was irate. “Frankly, watching Emily in Paris there’s plenty to feel insulted about. When they decided to caricature us, the authors didn’t hold back … no cliche is spared, not even the weakest.” In an interview with Elle UK in December, Collins declared that the show was seeking to correct some of the perceived errors in its second run, stating that it would be “more inclusive and diverse” as a result. Collins said: “For me as Emily, but also as a producer, after season one, hearing people’s thoughts, concerns, questions, likes, dislikes, just feelings about it, there were certain things that spoke to the time that we’re living in and what is right, moral and correct and should be done. I wanted diversity and inclusion in front of and behind the camera to be something that we really put our focus on.” Emily in Paris remains a hit for Netflix, and is currently in the top 10 most-viewed shows on the platform around the world.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/03/ukraine-culture-minister-blasts-emily-in-paris-over-insulting-stereotype
5846;5846;The Isle of Wight’s dinosaur hunter: we’re going to need a bigger museum;2022-01-03T10:53:35Z;['Hannah Devlin'];['Dinosaurs', 'Fossils', 'Palaeontology', 'UK news', 'Isle of Wight'];Some of us binged on box sets, others grappled with the challenges of home school and zoned out of Zoom meetings: for many, life under lockdown felt glum. But for Jeremy Lockwood, a retired GP turned palaeontologist, 2021 was a standout year featuring two big dinosaur discoveries and laying plans to make the Isle of Wight famous for its prehistoric inhabitants once more. “It was an absolutely thrilling time for me,” Lockwood said. Lockwood, 64, who retired as a family doctor in the Midlands seven years ago, was behind the widely publicised discovery of a new species of iguanadontian dinosaur with a distinctively large nose and a second species, nicknamed “the horned crocodile-faced Hell Heron”. At the start of the pandemic, Lockwood re-registered with the General Medical Council and volunteered to work. However, his daughter, also a doctor, pointed out that before vaccines were available, hospitals would not want people in their 60s walking around wards. So for the past two years, Lockwood has immersed himself in fossil hunting on the beach and sifting through boxes of bones from museum archives. In palaeontology, like astronomy, amateurs often work alongside academics and their scientific contributions are frequently recognised. On retirement, Lockwood decided to put his lifelong interest in dinosaurs on a formal footing and persuaded his wife to move to the Isle of Wight, where a steady stream of dinosaur fossils emerge from the cliffs as they are eroded. He contacted Prof David Martill, of the University of Portsmouth, about doing a PhD and was quickly accepted. “I felt I had to do something to keep me active,” he said. “I don’t think I could’ve just played golf or grown roses.” Lockwood is revisiting a golden era for dinosaur discovery with a focus on iguanodons, the first specimen of which was unearthed by Gideon Mantell, also a doctor turned palaeontologist, in Sussex in 1825. Some have assumed that the long timeline of discovery means that the understanding of British dinosaurs is essentially “done and dusted”. On the contrary, Lockwood said, certain dogmas have remained unchallenged. And modern methods, such as using software to cluster specimens into a most likely family tree, have not always been applied to earlier finds. Most dinosaurs found on the Isle of Wight had been traditionally assigned to just one of two species: the plant-eating Iguanodon bernissartensis and Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis. After sifting through many hundreds of bones that had been sitting in boxes in the Natural History Museum and the Dinosaur Isle museum, Lockwood identified a clear outlier with an enormous bulbous nose. The finding suggests there were far more iguanadontian dinosaurs in the Early Cretaceous of the UK than previously thought and raises the prospect of tracing the evolution of different traits through time. “You can almost liken this huge collection of iguanadontian bones to several jigsaw puzzles that are all mixed up,” said Lockwood. “I’m trying to put together something that is meaningful.” Officially, Lockwood is doing his doctorate part-time, but acknowledges that he has become “a bit obsessed”. “Sometimes I’ll work for 16 hours a day for a few weeks,” he said. “You struggle to find time to cut the lawn and decorate your house, and friends and family have to put up with you talking about dinosaurs all the time.” Alongside his work on archive specimens, Lockwood also makes daily surveys of the beach to spot any dinosaur bones emerging from the cliffs. Winter is peak collecting season. “Certainly with winter storms eroding things, that’s when the big finds come in,” said Lockwood. He is also coordinating a bid to redevelop the Dinosaur Isle museum, by a charitable group that Lockwood chairs together with a German company, Dinosaurier-Park International, after the local council launched a tender process. “I’m trying to take over the museum,” Lockwood said. “The Isle of Wight undersells its dinosaurs. Most people are unaware that we’re Europe’s hotspot for dinosaurs and early mammals. We need a much bigger museum.” Lockwood said he has “great sympathy” for former medical colleagues still working on the frontline during the pandemic and is particularly annoyed by the “lazy GP stereotype” sometimes aired in media coverage. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said. “You can see burnout happening all over the place.” Several doctors have got in touch to congratulate him on his recent successes. “Some of the nice tweets were from other doctors approaching retirement,” he said. “It’s really good to see that there’s a life after medicine.”;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/03/isle-of-wight-dinosaur-hunter-need-bigger-museum-jeremy-lockwood
5847;5847;Cheney says Republicans must choose between Trump and truth | First Thing;2022-01-03T10:53:15Z;['Nicola Slawson'];['US news'];"Good morning. The fallout from the Capitol attack continues as the first anniversary on Thursday approaches. Yesterday, a Republican member of the House committee investigating the events of 6 January 2021 had a stark warning for her party – they must choose between Trump and truth. “Our party has to choose,” Liz Cheney told CBS’s Face the Nation. “We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the constitution, but we cannot be both.” Trump supporters attacked Congress in an attempt to stop certification of his defeat by Joe Biden, which Trump maintains without evidence was the result of electoral fraud. Five people died after a riot in which a mob roamed the Capitol, searching for lawmakers to capture. On Sunday, Cheney and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the committee chair, again discussed the possibility of a criminal referral for Trump over his failure to attempt to stop the riot or for his obstruction of the investigation. What else did Cheney say? She told ABC’s This Week there were “potential criminal statutes at issue here, but I think that there’s absolutely no question that it was a dereliction of duty”. What did Thompson say? The Democrat told NBC’s Meet the Press the committee was examining whether it could issue subpoenas to members of Congress. US could be under rightwing dictator by 2030, Canadian professor warns
The US could be under a rightwing dictatorship by 2030, a Canadian political science professor has warned, urging his country to protect itself against the “collapse of American democracy”. “We mustn’t dismiss these possibilities just because they seem ludicrous or too horrible to imagine,” Thomas Homer-Dixon, the founding director of the Cascade Institute at Royal Roads University in British Columbia, wrote in the Globe and Mail. “In 2014, the suggestion that Donald Trump would become president would also have struck nearly everyone as absurd. But today we live in a world where the absurd regularly becomes real and the horrible commonplace.” Homer-Dixon’s message was blunt: “By 2025, American democracy could collapse, causing extreme domestic political instability, including widespread civil violence. By 2030, if not sooner, the country could be governed by a rightwing dictatorship.” How does he think it will happen? The author cited eventualities centered on a Trump return to the White House in 2024, possibly including Republican-held state legislatures refusing to accept a Democratic win. Meanwhile, key Donald Trump loyalists Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn are at the forefront of a drive to expand Trumpist influence at the local level of US politics. Hospitalization figures a better guide to Omicron than case count, says Fauci
The US government’s top medical adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, has joined a growing body of experts who say hospitalisation figures form a better guide to the severity of the Omicron coronavirus variant than the case count of new infections. Referring to the Omicron surge in the US as a “tsunami”, Fauci also cautioned the public against putting too much stock in preliminary data suggesting the variant lacks the severity of earlier Covid-19 variants, such as Delta. “You have a virus that looks like it might be less severe, at least from data we’ve gathered from South Africa, the UK and even some from preliminary data from here in the US,” he told CNN’s State of the Union. Why is it important to look at hospitalization figures? A number of experts have questioned if such reports on rocketing cases of Covid cause unnecessary worry, and suggest deaths and hospitalization data should better inform mitigation efforts. What else did Fauci say? He said: “The real bottom line that you want to be concerned about is, are we getting protected by the vaccines from severe disease leading to hospitalisation?” In other news …

5848;5848;Lincolnshire hospitals declare ‘critical incident’ over staff shortages;2022-01-03T10:26:42Z;['Maya Wolfe-Robinson'];['NHS', 'Coronavirus', 'Health', 'UK news', 'Lincolnshire'];"Several hospitals in Lincolnshire have declared a “critical incident” over “extreme and unprecedented” staff shortages. The United Lincolnshire hospitals NHS trust (ULHT), which includes four hospitals across the county, told its sites it was unable to maintain safe staffing levels, leading to “compromised care”. An internal memo dated Sunday, leaked to the media, said the biggest factor was the rapid increase in staff sickness across two of its sites, Lincoln county hospital in Lincoln and Pilgrim hospital in Boston. Figures showed the number of staff members absent because they were ill or quarantining with Covid-19 had doubled in the month before Christmas, with 150 staff isolating on Boxing Day. The trust insisted “essential services remain fully open for anyone who needs them” as it urged people “to come forward for care” if they needed to. The memo said the increasing numbers of Covid-positive patients were also adding to the pressure, with “a number of nosocomial infections on some ward areas” – people who had caught Covid since being admitted to hospital.
Staff ratios have been increased – the number of patients each nurse looks after – and NHS staff are being asked to volunteer to work extra hours. The memo reiterated its “full support to those taking a risk-balanced approach to patient care at this difficult time”. One of the largest acute hospital trusts in England, ULH includes Lincoln county hospital, Grantham and district hospital, Pilgrim hospital in Boston and County hospital Louth. In a statement, ULHT’s medical director, Dr Colin Farquharson, said: “As a result of significant staffing pressures due to absence related to Covid-19, we are having to take additional steps to maintain services. “Our staff continue to work exceptionally hard and we would like to reassure our patients and the public that in spite of the challenges faced, essential services remain fully open for anyone who needs them, so people should continue to come forward for care.” He added that people could help by getting their Covid booster vaccine “to protect themselves and their families and reduce pressure on health services”.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/03/lincolnshire-hospitals-declare-critical-incident-over-staff-shortages
5849;5849;Another Paradise review – shining a light on the Chagos Islands travesty;2022-01-03T10:00:43Z;['Phuong Le'];['Film', 'Documentary films', 'Chagos Islands', 'Culture', 'World news'];"Fifty years ago, the entire Creole population of the Chagos Islands were forcibly removed from their homes by British forces in order to make way for a US military base. Families were torn apart, scattered between the Seychelles and Mauritius, where they endured enormous economic hardships and discrimination. In Olivier Magis’ documentary, the horrors of those nights are painfully alive. Over atmospheric shots of rippling ocean waves we hear shocking first-person accounts of people throwing themselves overboard and small babies dying during these arduous journeys. Sabrina, a second-generation exile, carries this startlingly recent legacy on her indefatigable shoulders as she fights for the rights of her people to return to their homeland. Perpetually displaced, many of the Chagosian refugees currently living in England face insurmountable financial precariousness and get little state support. Their fervent protests outside the House of Lords also seem to fall on deaf ears: in 2016 the UK government decided against a resettlement of the islanders, citing monetary costs.
While Sabrina’s campaign is hampered by endless obstacles, moments of solidarity shine through; a major section of the film is dedicated to the camaraderie of a Chagosian football team who participate in the 2016 World Cup for stateless and diaspora groups. As a Chagosian song is played before a match, it not only rouses the spirit of the young athletes but also becomes a searing proclamation of statehood. There are some clumsy formal choices – Sabrina’s meetings with activists in the US are inexplicably scored to a jazzy improvisation – but this film is a damning reminder of a cruel imperialist intervention whose ramifications remain largely unfamiliar to the general public. • Another Paradise is available on 7 January on True Story.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/another-paradise-review-chagos-islands
5850;5850;Africa’s heritage is humanity’s – and it’s been overlooked for too long | Sada Mire;2022-01-03T10:00:43Z;['Sada Mire'];['Archaeology', 'Africa', 'Museums', 'Culture', 'Evolution'];In my first class on an archaeology course at Lund University in Sweden, I stood out more than usual. It was not just that it was full of blond and blue-eyed students, more than in any other class I had ever attended – it was that archaeology is not a field that many migrants study. My teacher and classmates were lovely, yet I still had this feeling of “What am I, a Somali refugee, doing here?” Furthermore, I had never even seen an archaeologist before, or held an archaeological object. But I had read a sentence in a book (Africa: history of a continent, by Basil Davidson) which said that to write African history we need to do archaeological research. As this first class was on European stone age archaeology, stone implements were handed out. An axe was passed to me. To my astonishment the label read “Somaliland”. Wow: an axe from my own country. The moment was like a message. It was as if someone was saying to me: “Yes, you belong in this classroom”. I bombarded our teacher with questions about the axe. He had no idea where it was from – he did not seem to care. Why would he? Stone age artefacts are mostly the same. No, he did not think there was any further documentation: only that they were palaeolithic objects. I later discovered that these objects were extraordinary. It turns out the axes were in fact history-making implements, taken out of my country in the exciting days when the idea of human evolution was taking shape. Fast-forward 20 years from that day in Lund and I’m creating a new global initiative, a digital museum to bring together in one platform all Somali objects and materials. I want people across Africa to feel the same connection to the subject as I did. In archaeology, context is everything: if your bones are found with those of extinct bears and mammoths, then you’ve probably been dead for tens of thousands of years and are most likely not even a Homo sapiens. In 1856 the first Neanderthal was discovered in Neander Valley in Germany. The Neanderthal would understandably not have liked to be thought of as the only link between modern humans and the great apes – they were too sophisticated. So it must have been a relief when, in the 1890s, Homo erectus came into the picture. The Java man, as this find came to be known, was labelled the “missing link”. Soon this “upright-ape-man” was joined by more hominids discovered in Asia. These discoveries reinforced the theories of Charles Darwin, first set out in 1859 in On the Origin of Species, and his idea of natural selection gained more ground. This was further evidence for the idea that humans had evolved from one common ancestor. Archaeologists didn’t bother to look to Africa until 1896, when Heywood Walter Seton-Karr, a Scottish game hunter, returned to London with hundreds of stone implements from British Somaliland. He proclaimed, to global attention, that he had found the garden of Eden: “Here it was, in my opinion, that the human race originated.” Major museums – one of which must have been the Lund natural history museum – lined up to acquire Somaliland artefacts, including stone tools. More discoveries on the continent followed, such as Kenya’s “Turkana boy” or Ethiopia’s “Lucy”. I have spent the past year surveying the same area where Seton-Karr stumbled on the stone axes. I asked village elders about him, hoping for some lingering generational memory. And though the name did not ring a bell – why should it – they told me the Ingriiskii (the British) used to come looking for macdan (gems) here. Often, foreign archaeological missions failed to tell the locals what they were really doing – indeed sometimes this still happens. The village chief vowed to me to protect his area, which also includes newly located 5,000-year-old rock paintings. By uncovering the hidden history of African collections long forgotten in museums in the west, the founders of our new archive have unearthed a wealth of art, technology and human history. With the application of technology, things of the past can come alive – through photogrammetry and 3D virtual tours – and feel more relevant to modern-day societies. We are collaborating with major western museums that hold African collections, including a number of UK institutions (the British Museum and Powell-Cotton Museum among them). But with all our digital work being carried out by African local teams, we are tapping into a new tech-savvy generation. The idea is to inspire Africans to be the owners of their heritage and its narratives. This is not just about the past. Our fast-growing demands for goods have put huge pressure on climate and resources and also made us forget our traditional ways of resource management and interacting with nature. One of the most extraordinary individuals we worked with was a blind potter. She had been trained by her mother who was in turn trained by her mother. Now she was with her own daughter who was training her daughters. This lineage of female potters will die out after surviving so many adversities just because so many people now opt for machine-produced pottery and imported plastic goods. Our museum aims to revitalise craft technologies such as pottery and iron-making. With objects often locally neglected, or forgotten in the storage departments of major museums, this heritage is at risk for the first time in history. If we do not bring together the people and stories that reflect what is most beautiful about human life – the ability to adapt to change and challenges – we may well lose sight of humanity itself.

5851;5851;Poem of the week: The Mower’s Song by Andrew Marvell;2022-01-03T10:00:43Z;['Carol Rumens'];['Poetry', 'Books', 'Culture'];"The Mower’s Song My mind was once the true survey Of all these meadows fresh and gay, And in the greenness of the grass Did see its hopes as in a glass; When Juliana came, and she What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me. But these, while I with sorrow pine, Grew more luxuriant still and fine, That not one blade of grass you spy’d But had a flower on either side; When Juliana came, and she What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me. Unthankful meadows, could you so A fellowship so true forgo? And in your gaudy May-games meet While I lay trodden under feet? When Juliana came, and she What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me. But what you in compassion ought, Shall now by my revenge be wrought; And flow’rs, and grass, and I and all, Will in one common ruin fall. For Juliana comes, and she What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me. And thus, ye meadows, which have been Companions of my thoughts more green, Shall now the heraldry become With which I shall adorn my tomb; For Juliana comes, and she What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me.
The Mower’s Song is one of four “Mower” poems by Andrew Marvell (1621-1678), complementing his most substantial work in the country house genre, Upon Appleton House. All date from the period he spent at Nun Appleton House (1651-2) as tutor to Mary, the daughter of Lord General Thomas Fairfax. The English civil war and the impending first Anglo-Dutch war enrich Marvell’s view of Arcadia. Lord Fairfax had laid out the gardens at Appleton “in the Figure of a Fort”. Upon Appleton House develops a brilliantly extended metaphor of the horticultural battleground, producing one of the most unusual and moving anti-war meditations of any age. Images of wounding, physical and psychological, recur in the Mower quartet. Perhaps Damon the Mower provides the most relevant and helpful context here. Damon, in love with Juliana (whose name is associated with July and thus the high summer heat of Damon’s desires) suffers not only the flames of love but accidentally wounds himself in the ankle with his own scythe. The theme of being “mown down” by love might suggest satire (for which Marvell certainly had no little talent) but its treatment is scarcely light-hearted, any more than the Mower is simply a figure of rustic innocence. The Mower imposes his will on nature like the more sophisticated, commercially motivated horticulturalist excoriated in The Mower Against Gardens. Intrinsic to banishment from Eden, the war between nature and unnaturally greedy humanity further infects the vision of the garden as redemptive pastoral. Lost clarity of understanding is proclaimed by the Mower in the first verse of his song, where the noun “survey” suggests a once informed, rational perception of the landscape. His hopes have similarly been decimated. The meadows are the subject of the second stanza, flourishing with new spring grass and a proliferation of wild flowers. Envious of the “gaudy May-games” the singer turns on these “unthankful meadows”, addressing them directly in stanza three. He goes on to declare that he will vengefully enforce the meadows’ withheld “compassion” (they should have wilted in sympathy with the lover) and ensure that “flow’rs, and grass, and I and all, / Will in one common ruin fall.” Marvell’s refrain suggests, perhaps, a rustic style of diction. The grammatical jolt between the two lines, “For Juliana comes, and she / What I do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me”, brings the violence of the scythe into the syntax, and turns the poem away from any potential comedy. Juliana’s verb, “came”, changes tense as the poem continues, while the narrative remains in the present continuous. When “came” shifts to “comes” in the last two stanzas, we can imagine the mower’s grass-like trembling at the approach of footsteps. In the final line of the refrain’s couplet, the two half-lines seem to swing like a scythe, the separating comma suggesting the pause between one keen stroke and another. Lightest of the Mower poems, The Mower’s Song still leaves us in no doubt about the speaker’s sense of devastation, and that these represent the general state of the fallen human world and its relationships. For a detailed examination of the Mower poems and their relation to Marvell’s other work, this thesis is well worth a look.";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/03/poem-of-the-week-the-mowers-song-by-andrew-marvell
5852;5852;Just refresh webpage, UK minister tells people trying to get Covid tests;2022-01-03T09:21:37Z;['Jamie Grierson'];['Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'Nadhim Zahawi', 'Health policy', 'UK news', 'Health', 'Politics', 'Society', 'England'];"People struggling to get lateral flow tests for Covid “should just refresh” their webpage, the education secretary has suggested, as concerns mount over the impact of the Omicron variant on the country’s workforce. Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News he had organised a separate supply of tests for schools in England ahead of children’s return to the classrooms, amid requests they take at least two a week. But when it was put to the cabinet minister that shortages of tests were still being reported intermittently across the country, he said: “If people feel that they can’t get a supply they should just refresh their webpage.” Zahawi said supply had been increased to 300m a month and delivery capacity trebled to 900,000 a day.
In addition to testing, the government will ask secondary students in England to wear masks in classrooms once again. And it was announced that an additional 7,000 air cleaning units will be provided to schools, colleges and early years settings to improve ventilation in teaching spaces. Classes could be merged if the number of school staff off sick grew too high, the education secretary has said. He told Sky News: “The priority is to keep schools open. The testing, the staffing support we’re putting in place, and of course the ventilation is going to make a big difference to schools this year. The most important thing is to keep them open. “We monitor staff absenteeism, I just said to you we’re running at about 8% last year. If that rises further then we look at things like merging classes, teaching in bigger numbers.”
But Zahawi repeated the government line that “there’s nothing in the data” to suggest further coronavirus measures will be needed later this week. He told BBC Breakfast that plan B measures would be reviewed on Wednesday, but added: “There’s nothing in the data that gives me any concern that we need to go beyond where we are at. “There’s some really good data from London that it looks like the infection rates are plateauing, if not yet coming down. But we are seeing leakage into the over-50s in terms of infections, and it’s generally the over-50s who end up with severe infection and hospitalisation.” Zahawi moved to reassure patients that the NHS was “very good at being able to move staff around”, amid fears over shortages in the health service. He said the NHS was used to dealing with staff being off over the winter and during “big flu viruses”. He told BBC Breakfast: “The NHS is very good at being able to move staff around within the system. They have an infrastructure to do that. We now have 10,000 more nurses and 3,000 more doctors than we had last year working in the NHS. “But the NHS is very good at sort of making sure that staff shortages are monitored and dealt with pretty well. They’ve done it over many years in winter when we’ve been, you know, have big flu viruses around.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/just-refresh-webpage-uk-minister-tells-people-trying-covid-tests

Twelve months on, Liverpool’s two early goals at Stamford Bridge could have induced Groundhog Day feelings. Instead, Thomas Tuchel’s side roared back and showed that, whatever other problems have recently beset the Chelsea manager on and off the field, this is a team that plays for him. Though they did so in a rather un-Tuchel-like manner. The intense atmosphere generated by the Premier League debut of safe standing was met with the kind of front-foot, high-tempo performance more associated with a Jürgen Klopp side. Chelsea were the better team against Liverpool but they will rue the openness at the back that meant they had to settle for another draw which probably ends their title hopes, and more than the much-discussed Romelu Lukaku it is their first-choice full-backs, Ben Chilwell and Reece James, that they are missing most. Tom Davies Tuchel refuses to guarantee Lukaku return to Chelsea team
2) Mané makes his presence felt in more ways than one Liverpool were not at their fluent, cohesive best at Chelsea, though they played their part in a compelling spectacle. But they came away with a point because they have what Chelsea lack, forwards with a ruthless and instinctive eye for goal. It was no surprise Mohamed Salah scored another fabulous goal, and could have added an even better one with an instinctive long-range chip that Édouard Mendy saved sharply, but Sadio Mané’s was the more intriguing display after a lean run. His goal showcased the Senegalese at his clinical best, punishing Trevor Chalobah’s botched clearance, and he was a busy presence throughout. Yet there were also rash moments, from the risky raising of an elbow against César Azpilicueta in the sixth second of the match to the slightly weak, hasty finishes at the end of a couple of slick breakaways early in the second half. Overall he showed enough to demonstrate why Senegal will cherish him, and Liverpool miss him, during the Africa Cup of Nations. TD Match report: Chelsea 2-2 Liverpool 3) Arsenal should focus on positives after City’s smash and grab There are times when you can take genuine succour from listening to your opponents. “Arsenal were better,” Pep Guardiola said after Manchester City’s smash and grab at the Emirates. “We faced an incredible team,” agreed Rodri, the matchwinner. Guardiola has historically gone out of his way to praise Mikel Arteta, a close friend, but no exaggeration was required on Saturday: City were overwhelmed for half of the game and Arsenal would do well to focus on that rather than the VAR calls, correct but convoluted, that helped turn the outcome. Officials are not biased against your team, whoever you support, even if is tempting to feel that way after such a rousing display counts for nothing. It is better to focus on what gives pleasure. Nick Ames Match report: Arsenal 1-2 Manchester City 4) VAR gives Watford fans – and referees – cause for outrage Another example of how VAR creates controversy. When Hugo Lloris dived at the feet of João Pedro and the referee, Robert Jones, who seemed in a good position, decisively gestured that the goalkeeper had won the ball, there was no reason not to think the decision had been correct. The ball had squirted out of the challenge at the sort of angle that suggested Lloris had taken it cleanly. But slowed down, a different picture emerged. Lloris, almost certainly, did foul Pedro, but that was almost impossible to tell in real time. Before VAR, while Watford fans may still have been outraged, others would have shrugged and accepted that in a fast-moving game, some things are impossible to give. Now, though, VAR creates an expectation of perfection and that makes the already difficult job of refereeing even harder. Jonathan Wilson Match report: Watford 0-1 Tottenham
5) Olise can be Palace’s next young star Patrick Vieira’s decision to replace Luka Milivojevic and Christian Benteke with Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta in the second half almost rescued a point for Palace, three goals down at the break to West Ham. Olise has now been directly involved in a goal every 63 minutes in the Premier League this season having set up Odsonne Édouard before scoring directly from a free-kick. Not bad for a player who hadn’t even trained for the last week and a half. “Michael is a top young player with a lot of talent,” said Vieira. “It was a gamble for us, as we didn’t know how he was physically. I was really pleased with the way he came into the game because he created chances, he created situations, and he scored a goal. He showed in the space of 20 minutes his quality, and that’s really good for the football club.” Ed Aarons Match report: Crystal Palace 2-3 West Ham 6) Brentford look safe for second half of the season Brentford can be delighted with the first half of their Premier League bow. After 19 games they are 12th with 23 points and, even though there is plenty of football to be played, you would struggle to find a single onlooker who believes they will not secure another season in the top flight. That said, the victory over Aston Villa felt crucial given they had only won two games in their previous 11. It was earned through sheer grit and Thomas Frank had a fair point when he said afterwards that only Leeds have suffered comparable injury woes. Promoted sides often wilt when the ravages of the winter begin to kick in but Brentford, who dazzled with their flowing football in the Championship but have shown different sides to their game in the Premier League, have displayed the mentality of giants to pull through and prove doubters wrong. Nick Ames Match report: Brentford 2-1 Aston Villa
7) Mac Allister’s form another feather in Potter’s cap Whereas Rafael Benítez prefers to freeze out Lucas Digne to such an extent that Séamus Coleman started at left wing-back against Brighton, with the France international an unused substitute for Everton’s eighth defeat in 11 games, Graham Potter’s ability to keep unhappy players onside underpinned his club’s first ever victory at Goodison Park. Alexis Mac Allister was, by his manager’s own admission, frustrated with his limited playing time earlier in the season but marked his third successive start in a demanding week with a match-winning display against Benítez’s toiling team. “It just goes to show that football changes quickly,” the Brighton manager said. “Alexis has worked hard, stuck with the team and because he has been professional he can come in and perform. He scored two great goals but his overall performance was fantastic.” Andy Hunter Match report: Everton 2-3 Brighton 8) Burnley could melt away without Cornet to count on It is far-fetched to ever suggest one team’s fortunes are defined by a single player, but the case of Maxwel Cornet and Burnley is about as close as you could find right now. Cornet’s sixth goal of the season in 11 Premier League appearances looked as though it would rescue a point at Leeds before the visitors were undone by two late strikes. The worry for Burnley is that Cornet, a player who they clearly rely on for moments of magic, is now headed for the Africa Cup of Nations. That makes Burnley’s January business all the more important but, even with new additions, you suspect their hopes of survival will revolve largely around one man as the season heads for the final stretch. Aaron Bower Match report: Leeds 3-1 Burnley
9) Wolves a stern test for troubled Rangnick regime Manchester United are unbeaten in five games under Ralf Rangnick and yet the mood music continues to be downbeat. The 3-1 home win over an understrength Burnley barely salved the wounds of a dreadful performance and fortunate draw at Newcastle, a feast for amateur body language experts. Rangnick was an antsy sideline presence during the Burnley game, repeatedly urging his players to chase the “second ball” far harder. He has already shifted his 4-2-2-2 to something more akin to 4-4-2. Wolves did not play during the festive season but they will likely be harder to beat for United than two teams in the bottom three. Before Wolves’ hiatus, It look a last-minute goal for Liverpool to win at Molineux while Manchester City required a penalty to squeak past them. They don’t score many, but they don’t concede many either. John Brewin Rangnick says Cavani ‘definitely’ staying at United
10) January window finally here for Newcastle Whenever Newcastle return to action, the expectation is Eddie Howe will be able to pick from a far fuller deck, with Covid isolation periods ending, the injury list easing and a first tranche of Saudi Arabian loot spent on new players. The names linked most closely are not quite of the Kylian Mbappé and Neymar level just yet, but someone as accomplished and experienced as Kieran Tripper would add quality to their defence. Eddie Howe’s working relationship with the England full-back from their time at Burnley a decade ago may facilitate that deal but other transfers may be harder to pull off. Convincing players to join a team second-bottom of the league and with one win all season will take serious cash and powers of persuasion. The suspicion is Newcastle’s back office, with no director of football or chief executive yet appointed, lacks the expertise and contacts to bring in the players who might guarantee survival.

5854;5854;House of healing: the Honduran sanctuary for female rights defenders;2022-01-03T09:00:42Z;['Jeff Ernst'];"[""Women's rights and gender equality"", 'Global development', 'Human rights', 'Honduras', 'Americas', 'World news', 'Women', 'Environment', 'Human rights']";"A milky-white and sky-blue stone hangs from a red string around Ethels Correa’s neck, and every so often she rubs it between her fingers. “When I feel anger, I grab this stone and I begin to relax, because they taught me how to breathe, to relax the body and to relax the mind,” she says. “I carry it with me all the time.” Correa, 41, from the south coast of Honduras, is among a group on a visit to La Siguata, a healing centre for women like her who are suffering from trauma as a consequence of having stood up for human rights in the country. “When I came here, I felt old, wrinkled,” says Correa, a mother of five who has been involved in land struggles in her home town, Zacate Grande, for two decades. But now, when she looks in the mirror, she sees a different reflection. “I look beautiful.”
Inaugurated earlier this year, the 10-day retreat at La Siguata is part of a tiny but growing movement led by the Mesoamerican Initiative of Women Human Rights Defenders, which funds this and another centre in Oaxaca, Mexico, addressing the mental health issues that come with working in one of the world’s most dangerous regions for activists and women. “We realised that there was lots of burnout and also strong impacts on women defenders as a result of structural violence, as well as patriarchal violence that was very invisible and normalised,” says Ana María Hernández of Casa La Serena healing centre in Oaxaca, Mexico, which opened in 2016 and has since welcomed hundreds of women from across the region. “The very demanding dynamics of women defenders’ activism means that we don’t have time to recover our energies, to connect with our bodies and needs. There is an imbalance between giving and receiving,” adds Hernández.
Hernández and colleagues from the Consortium for Parliamentary Dialogue and Equity in Oaxaca developed a holistic approach to help women overcome trauma and recharge, so they can continue their work with renewed vigour. During their 10-day visits to the centres, women participate in activities from the artistic to the spiritual, in groups and individually, and are given a personalised self-care plan to take home. La Siguata – which means “the woman” in the Uto-Aztecan Nahuatl language – sits behind high walls in the pine-covered mountains above the capital Tegucigalpa. “Since entering that gate, I felt connected, I felt like a protected woman,” says Correa. Solidarity is a guiding principle of the centre, encapsulated by a motto adopted from the Garifuna culture of the country’s north coast, painted over its entrance. It translates as “You for me, me for you.”
The grounds of flowers and fruit trees provide a stark contrast to the concrete landscape of the city below. The women can relax in hammocks or gather around a firepit surrounded by marigolds. “This space teaches us to love nature, to feel that energy of the earth and the air, which I had not experienced,” says Sandra Laínez, 63, a member of the Network of Domestic Workers, who were among the first group to visit La Siguata.
The centre has facilities for massage, bathing and acupuncture. “I arrived with a lot of body pain and I didn’t feel well,” says Correa, who has suffered a lot of violence over her life, including a blow to the head that she says she was lucky to survive. “If I’m sick, then I’m no good to the organisation.” Inside the house are dormitories, a spacious kitchen where cooking lessons are held, and an altar with candles and flowers dedicated to environmentalist Berta Cáceres, murdered after years of threats over her opposition to a dam project. It provides a poignant reminder of the hostility towards activists in Honduras, a nation with the highest rate of femicide in Latin America. “In the midst of this struggle, we have lost our sisters and our comrades,” says Rebeca Girón, of the National Network of Women Human Rights Defenders, who runs La Siguata.
The centre is also open to survivors of sexual abuse and families of disappeared migrants. In the near future, it is hoped that women from Nicaragua – where the government has brutally repressed dissent, resulting in more than 300 deaths during the wave of protests in 2018 alone – will be able to visit. “We know that these 10 days are not going to be the 10 days that will transform their lives, with sudden changes from one day to the next,” says Girón. “But we do consider that we open the way. “La Siguata represents the recovery of that internal flame of passion, for wanting to live again and even to enjoy human rights work anew.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:";https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/03/house-of-healing-the-honduran-sanctuary-for-female-rights-defenders
5855;5855;What’s new, pussycat? How feline film stars are trained to perform;2022-01-03T09:00:42Z;['Ann Lee'];['Film', 'Cats', 'Animals', 'Culture', 'Life and style', 'Pets', 'World news'];"Cats have been effortlessly stealing scenes from their human co-stars for decades. Who could forget Audrey Hepburn’s adorable marmalade tabby in Breakfast at Tiffany’s? Or Jinx, the toilet-flushing Himalayan in Meet the Parents? Behind every famous film cat, there is a dedicated trainer patiently teaching them to obey a command, making sure they’re happy on set, and grooming them fastidiously to maintain their fluffy good looks. The film-makers behind The Electrical Life of Louis Wain, a British period biopic about the Edwardian artist and illustrator who became famous for his surreal portraits of cats, were adamant they didn’t want to use CGI for the shoot, so animal trainer Charlotte Wilde was brought in with 40 feisty felines. “It was organised chaos,” she says. “They had their own green room and were treated like royalty.” Wilde, who has also worked on Fighting With My Family and Bohemian Rhapsody, runs a London agency that provides animals for film and TV. Felix, her 10-year-old black and white moggie (“a very cheeky chap!”), was cast as Peter, Wain’s furry best friend, who inspires his first sketches. Cats, of course, are notoriously fickle and independent – but that doesn’t mean they can’t be trained like dogs to behave and do tricks on screen. Wilde says she uses positive reinforcement with plenty of snacks on hand to dish out as rewards. “We teach our cats to go to mark,” she says. “They’ll walk in and they’ll know where to stop. We train them so they run to the sound of a buzzer. We’ve got some that can roll over. A couple can retrieve. They’ll lie down, rub against people’s legs, walk alongside someone. We show them what they’ve got to do. Then we try to make that happen on the take.”
A clicker is used as encouragement. “You might have a moment in between a couple of lines where we can get a click in, just so the cat [knows]: ‘You’re doing really well. Wait. Food is coming.’ Obviously, that’s really distracting for actors. They’re probably sick of the sound of a clicker by the end of the film!” Mark Harden, an animal trainer based in Los Angeles, was in charge of the five snowy white Chinchilla Persians who played Snowbell in Stuart Little, and looked after 40 cats on the set of Catwoman including several rare Egyptian Maus. With cats, he says, it’s all about getting into their mindset. “They’re a predator but they can also be skittish. They’ve got a very strong flight reaction. The most important thing with a cat is desensitising them to strange environments. A movie set is a very strange environment.”
Canadian animal trainer Melissa Millett has a novel way of desensitising the cats she works with: she stages mock film shoots at home. For the Pet Sematary reboot, she recruited five Maine Coons from rescue shelters to play Church, who is transformed into an aggressive zombie cat. This meant gradually acclimatising them to wearing makeup and being wet. The whole process took two months. “We started with a catnip party in the bathtub. A little bit of water on the cat while it’s eating. Then we worked up to a full bath. Separately, we would start with a bit of egg white and then work our way up. All the products had to be edible.” Expectations for cat actors tend to be much lower than for dogs, says Harden. “People are more in awe of you when you have a good working cat. I guess they expect the cat to be scared.” Even so, animal trainers can teach cats to do the kind of tricks that would easily outshine Lassie. Millett has a talented Bengal named Sashimi, who can ride a scooter. Wilde taught one of her moggies, Leicester, to pretend to play the harmonica, while Harden trained Cairo, an Egyptian Mau, to pick up a mobile phone with his teeth and run off with it. But it’s not all cats being cute and cuddly on cue. Being bitten accidentally is an occupational hazard. Then there’s the cat hair that gets everywhere. “You certainly don’t wear your best clothes to work!” says Wilde. “You have to get up extra early because you’ve got to get the animals ready. You go to bed later because you’ve got to put them to bed. They come first no matter what. I’d say it’s a way of life rather than a job. It’s incredibly rewarding. They give you so much.” • The Electrical Life of Louis Wain is out in UK cinemas on 1 January.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/whats-new-pussycat-how-feline-film-stars-are-trained-to-perform
5856;5856;Walk Me to the Corner by Anneli Furmark review – Brief Encounter for the digital age;2022-01-03T09:00:42Z;['Rachel Cooke'];['Comics and graphic novels', 'Books', 'Fiction', 'Culture'];"Elise, a fiftysomething writer, has work that she enjoys, a husband of 23 years with whom she is “uncommonly happy”, and two grownup sons. If her life is uneventful, it’s also replete; she is content and (this is the more important thing) grateful for such contentment. But then, as if a heavy stone had been hurled into a tranquil pool, it happens. At a party, she meets Dagmar, and something inside her shifts. Back at home, she considers her body in the bathroom mirror and thinks vaguely of what it might be like to sleep with this woman – or anyone! – at this point in her life. It is unthinkable and yet, it’s about to happen. She and Dagmar start sending each other text messages. Quite soon after this, they go to bed with each other, and it is wonderful.
Elise doesn’t lie to her husband. She tells him that she doesn’t want to leave him, but that she cannot stop herself from seeing Dagmar, and he makes his decision: they separate, and he begins a new relationship. But freedom doesn’t make life any easier for Elise, and not only because she misses Henrik so badly. Dagmar has a wife and two children, and she will not leave them for Elise – though neither will she break off with her. Live in the moment, she tells her lover; be happy with what we’ve got. But what have they got? Conversations conducted on cold park benches. Snatched weekends that are over almost before they’ve begun. An endless, lonely present. Which would be worse, Elise asks herself: a life without Dagmar, or this half-life of longing and WhatsApp? Is a little bit of Dagmar, however small, really better than nothing at all? And if it is, what does this say about the rest of their lives?
I adored Anneli Furmark’s last book, Red Winter, about love among radical leftists in northern Sweden, but I feel even more strongly about Walk Me to the Corner (translated by Hanna Strömberg). However painful to read, it captures so brilliantly both the unexpectedness of sudden desire in middle age – as Elise tells her son, she hadn’t realised that fiftysomething love would feel exactly the same as twentysomething love; that it would come with all the same ridiculous and paralysing uncertainties – and the utter misery that comes with falling for someone whose deeds simply do not match their words. Does Dagmar love Elise? She says she does. But will she give up anything for her at all? No, she will not. Furmark’s richly coloured drawings are sketchy, rough around the edges. But they’re wonderfully effective: I love the way she makes women’s bodies and faces look so seductively solid and generous; somehow, she imbues even everyday objects – a quilt, a coffee cup, a freshly laundered vest – with an incredible tenderness, as if these things, too, had feelings. Given the complexity of what she’s aiming to capture – all the agonising repetition of a lop-sided affair – her narration is amazingly concise, in part because she’s so very deft at incorporating the tiny screens of mobile phones into her story. How swiftly yearning reduces a lover’s world to the length and breadth of their malevolent/ecstatic glow. With what astonishing speed a heart comes to depend on a brief text message.

5857;5857;Everton close to signing Rangers right-back Nathan Patterson for initial £12m;2022-01-03T09:00:07Z;['Fabrizio Romano'];['Everton', 'Rangers', 'Transfer window', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Everton are close to signing the right-back Nathan Patterson from Rangers for £12m plus add-ons. The 20-year-old Scotland international is in line to become the club’s second January purchase after Vitaliy Mykolenko. Patterson is not a regular starter for Rangers but was identified by Rafael Benítez as a target when the manager took over last summer. Two Everton bids were rejected in that transfer window, with Steven Gerrard, the then Rangers manager, describing the initial £5m offer “a joke”. The fee agreed by Rangers would be the biggest received by the club.
Patterson’s arrival after that of Mykolenko would meet Benítez’s desire to strengthen in both full-back positions. Mykolenko, a Ukraine left-back, cost an initial £17.9m and the money being spent by Everton is a substantial upgrade on last summer, when the £1.7m Demarai Gray and free transfers were signed. Patterson has played six times for Scotland and scored on his most recent appearance, the 2-0 win in Moldova that guaranteed a place in March’s World Cup play-offs, in which Steve Clarke’s team face Ukraine in the semi-finals. Everton’s poor form – one win in 12 games – continued on Sunday with a home defeat by Brighton. There was again no place in the team for the left-back Lucas Digne, who is expected to leave this month after being ostracised by Benítez.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/everton-rangers-nathan-patterson-transfer-news
5858;5858;Football transfer rumours: Trippier, Aubameyang and more to Newcastle?;2022-01-03T08:34:54Z;['John Brewin'];['Transfer window', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Newcastle United', 'Manchester United', 'Tottenham Hotspur', 'Chelsea'];"New year, new Rumour Mill, new Newcastle. At least, that’s the plan, with their new ownership having waited three long months to splash the cash on their plaything.
Among the first to come in looks likely to be Kieran Trippier, scorer of a World Cup semi-final goal for England and a La Liga winner with Atlético Madrid last season. What might attract him to a move to the north east? The word is a previous working relationship with Eddie Howe from their time together at Burnley. Who else might come in? Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, unloved at Arsenal but heading to the Africa Cup of Nations with Gabon, looks like a two-plus-two-equalling-five equation. Odion Ighalo, who plays his football in Saudi Arabia with Al Shabab, and must be gettable, is also at the Afcon with Nigeria. Which may leave Darwin Núñez of Benfica, though he may cost a premium of £50m and, as one of the hottest properties in the game, may need to be offered serious cash to fight out a relegation battle. Luis Díaz, Porto’s Colombian flier, is another player linked with Newcastle though Liverpool are also a possible destination should they wish to refresh their squad in the absence of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané at that soccer jamboree in Cameroon. And another possible Newcastle target – let’s face it, most of the footballing world is a target at this point – is Gabriel Barbosa of Flamengo: aka Gabigol. How about a defender? Sven Botman of Lille, the Dutch international, a Ligue 1 winner last season will cost £30m from a club willing to sell the 21-year-old, as they are short of cash. But is Botman willing to join? How about a midfielder? An emotional return for Georginio Wijnaldum, on big money but not playing much for Paris Saint-Germain? Seems unlikely, but all bets are off in the magical world of the January market. Meanwhile it is said that PSG would like to sign Chelsea-owned Crystal Palace tyro Conor Gallagher to play in midfield. Other clubs are available, and there is talk of a swap deal – like they ever come off – between Manchester United and Barcelona for Ousmane Dembélé and Anthony Martial. United’s long-term target is Declan Rice, but good luck in getting West Ham to sell in January.
The Hammers, though, may be willing to spend some of the summer’s probable Rice cash – he is also wanted by Chelsea and Manchester City - on Rumour Mill favourite Adama Traoré, who also interests Tottenham. Any other Spurs business? Yes, the wild suggestion in Italy that unhappy Romelu Lukaku might want to join up with Antonio Conte to put an end to his Chelsea “nightmare”. With Manchester City running away with the Premier League and most of the big clubs keeping their powder dry before the summer, it may be a quiet market beyond Real Madrid’s continued interest in Kylian Mbappé. And that probably means this column should be thankful for Newcastle having money to burn.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/football-transfer-rumours-newcastle-trippier-aubameyang-wijnaldum
5859;5859;Apocalypse nowadays: the new wave of films about the end of the world;2022-01-03T08:00:42Z;['Alex Hess'];"['Film', ""Don't Look Up"", 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Climate crisis', 'Culture', 'Environment', 'Dr Strangelove', 'Independence Day: Resurgence']";"Which films kept you entertained over the holidays? Was it Silent Night, the sweary festive Britcom starring Keira Knightley? The courtroom drama Naked Singularity, with John Boyega as a crusading lawyer? Or did you watch Leonardo DiCaprio as a dorky astronomer in Don’t Look Up, a slapstick political satire? Whichever it was, I hope you poured yourself a large one, because none of those films are quite as light as they seem. All take place in the shadow of imminent Armageddon. That’s right: the end of the world is nigh, and it’s no longer the preserve of megabudget disaster movies or bleak survivalist thrillers. These days the looming obliteration of our species can just as readily form the backdrop to some governmental mockery or a boozy country-house drama.
Why the sudden change? After all, existential catastrophe is hardly a new subject for Hollywood, which has been churning out such tales for the best part of a century. Historically, though, they have largely come in the form of razzle-dazzle showstoppers, be it during the original disaster-movie boom, with titles like When Worlds Collide, or more recent CGI-fuelled fare such as The Day After Tomorrow. The more muted end-times films have been generally been left to less popcorn-hungry countries like Russia (The Sacrifice), France (Time of the Wolf, Delicatessen) and Canada (Last Night). But the mainstream movie industry has nonetheless made sure that even the most casual filmgoer will be well used to witnessing humanity’s spectacular destruction. We’ve seen it carried out by deranged scientists and comic-book villains, by robot uprising and cosmic collision, by viral outbreak and biblical flood, by dragons, birds and talking monkeys. And unsurprisingly, a genre predicated on the ultimate worst-case scenario has tended to reflect the anxieties of the time. Invasion of the Body Snatchers offered an allegory for McCarthyism; Steven Spielberg’s War of the Worlds, with its nightmarish urban devastation, was the first truly post-9/11 blockbuster; Wall-E sounded the alarm about mass consumerism. The genre itself initially mushroomed during the cold war, when “mutually assured destruction” became a household phrase. Now it’s exploding again. According to the Wikipedia page listing “apocalyptic films”, there were more additions to the genre in the past decade than the previous two combined. In the last year alone the destruction of our planet has been either realised or threatened in sci-fi extravaganzas, family tearjerkers and chirpy animated romps. This year will bring more of the same: slated for TV are two cheerless visions of post-viral dystopia, The Last of Us and Station Eleven, as well as the Ronseal-titled Extinction. At the cinema, we’ll get the big-screen pageantry of Moonfall from disaster impresario Roland Emmerich, and a Noah Baumbach adaptation of Don DeLillo’s eco-fiasco novel White Noise.
But before all that, treat yourself to the best film of the festive season: The Humans, an understated chamber piece in which a dysfunctional family gather for Thanksgiving under a distinct atmosphere of – you guessed it! – creeping existential dread. The real drama, though, lies in the bickering of rival siblings, senile grandparents and sozzled patriarchs. It’s more evidence that end-times anxiety can now be treated as mundane, off-screen, secondary to the domestic fallout: call it kitchen-sink nihilism.
It’s a long way from the cigar-chomping triumphalism of Armageddon and Independence Day – both certified artefacts of Clinton-era America – but maybe this trend for quietly apocalypse-adjacent storytelling is to be expected in an era when the real-world headlines tell of survival bunkers, fire tornadoes and doomsday glaciers. Dr Strangelove’s breakneck bomb-ride was the response to a world where nuclear decimation could arrive at any moment; maybe this new mode of restraint reflects a reality where the unthinkable seems to be unfolding bit by bit, a matter of glum inevitability. Adam McKay’s climate-change satire Don’t Look Up takes its lead from Kubrick’s movie, invoking the apocalypse as an act of ridicule towards a complacent political class. But six decades on, the tone has shifted from anarchic glee to resigned exasperation. “Maybe the destruction of the entire planet isn’t supposed to be fun,” says Jennifer Lawrence’s scientist. “Maybe it’s supposed to be unsettling.” It’s a credo that unites this current crop of films, which all provoke angst rather than excitement, defeatism rather than hope. This is the way the world ends: not with a bang, but a shrug. Or as Arnold Schwarzenegger grumbles in End of Days, while the scenario of the title closes in: “We have some real serious problems here – and we’re not solving any of them!” And when it comes to the annihilation of humankind, there’s a man who knows what he’s talking about.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/apocalypse-nowadays-the-new-wave-of-films-about-the-end-of-the-world
5860;5860;The big idea: should we eat like our ancestors? ;2022-01-03T08:00:42Z;['Farrah Jarral'];['Health, mind and body books', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Diets and dieting', 'Life and style'];"April isn’t the cruellest month – January is. There is no other time of year when we are as prone to navel-gazing, often literally, as this one. In this period of anxiety about the size of our waists and what we consume, simple dietary rules are appealing. “Eat like our ancestors” is a particularly catchy slogan to live by, at least on the surface. But who exactly are these ancestors we are supposed to emulate? Are they our great-great-grandparents, cooking wholesome things from scratch? Or are they that nebulous group of hairy low-browed brutes we imagine “cavemen” to be? The popular “paleo” diet pins modern health woes on the birth of agriculture, claiming that we should stick to eating meat, nuts and berries. Strict paleo dieters are forbidden from eating beans, as well as potatoes and grains. This kind of stone age reenactment has rather a loose grip on history, however. For starters, it’s based on the false premise that palaeolithic peoples all ate the same food, regardless of their location. Somerset’s 9,000-year-old Cheddar Man, who scientists tell us was rather disappointingly lactose-intolerant, would not have eaten the same foods as his contemporaries on the Kenyan savannah. Geography, climate and culture shaped the food choices of humans of the past as they do today. The amount of meat people ate, and how much was obtained by hunting versus scavenging, is also up for debate. Founded on what Giles Yeo refers to as the “‘Fred Flintstone and his brontosaurus ribs’ school of pre-history”, the paleo fad has a streak of solipsism as well as hubris and fantasy. It is focused almost exclusively on what’s perceived to be good for our bodies, without any concern for the rest of nature, including other humans whose livelihoods are threatened by western overconsumption.
Conversations about how to eat well and recreate the habits of the past often feature a selective suspicion of science and technology. What is supposedly “natural” – a category that includes polio, death in childbirth and poisonous mushrooms – is conflated with what is good or right. Professor Heidi Larson has observed a clustering of identity markers on social media – “paleo, gluten-free-diets, home births” – with anti-vaccine sentiment. Beneath the intellectualisation, there is a gnawing sense of alienation from our bodies, and disenchantment with modern lifestyles. Yet attempts to recreate the past are not only misguided but impossible. The fruit and vegetables we eat today are the result of many generations of tampering with the genetics of once-wild plants. Growing cereal crops is necessary to feed populations that hunter-gatherer lifestyles could not sustain. Processing food in some way, whether by cooking, fermenting or drying it, has allowed us to obtain more energy from it, made it safer, and helped us to preserve it for leaner times. Which is not to say that some of the changes we’ve made to our food and the way it’s produced are not harmful to our bodies, other animals and the environment. While we are living longer than ever, modern life can make us sick. Eating lots of ultra-processed foods – with excess salt and sugar, emulsifiers, inverted corn syrup, flavourings and colourings – is associated with an increased risk of a range of diseases. Such foods are often designed to be hyperpalatable, hitting a sweet spot of sugar, salt and fat that makes them devilishly moreish. Michael Pollan’s suggestion that we should be wary of things our great-grandmothers wouldn’t recognise as food is a reasonable but blunt instrument to help avoid these. Mine would certainly be mystified by a wedge of Stinking Bishop. Were I to eat like my own Punjabi farming great-grandparents, I’d breakfast at dawn on a glass of fresh lassi and a hot chapati with a fist-sized lump of cultured butter, lunch on seasonal fruit, and dine on lentils and roti. Wild honey from a forest beehive would be a precious treat, often reserved for the sick. On the rare occasion that someone’s bullock broke a leg, it would be slaughtered and the meat distributed throughout the village. This diet is based on the wheat and dairy staples that people in the Punjab have relied on for probably at least the last two millennia – the sanskrit hymns of the Rig Veda are drenched with references to milk and butter. But as delicious and “authentic” as it might be for me to follow its lead, the ethics of industrially farmed dairy products in the 21st century muddies the waters.
We crave authority, and look to the ancients to tell us what to do and how to live. Ancestor worship is more ubiquitous in human culture than belief in a creator god. The romance of eating like our ancestors, whatever that means, can obscure ethical considerations in a haze of nostalgia. Now, probably more than ever before, what we eat connects us to the fate of other beings, human and non-human, and to the fate of our planet. With this in mind, choosing to be deliberate about what we eat, and cooking it ourselves if we have that privilege, can only be a good thing. But a dogmatic approach to this would be a mistake. Better to preserve what’s worth keeping, let go of what isn’t and remain clear-eyed about our culinary past – much of which is unknowable, unethical and impossible to replicate in any case. As we resolve once again to live better this year, neither Rousseau’s noble savage nor Great-Aunt Ethel need dictate what’s for dinner.

5861;5861;‘Everything is a fight’: the island still reeling months after Ida battered Louisiana;2022-01-03T08:00:41Z;['Oliver Laughland'];['Louisiana', 'US news', 'Hurricanes', 'Hurricane Katrina'];"David Sears spent six weeks sleeping outside on the splintered remains of his home on Grand Isle, Louisiana. The house was destroyed by Hurricane Ida at the end of August but Sears had nowhere else to go. So he returned to this barrier island, out in the gulf of Mexico, and lived on his front porch for over a month. Grand Isle, with its sweeping white sand beaches, rows of bobbing shrimp boats and 1,000 permanent residents, took the first punch from Ida, the category 4 hurricane that became one of America’s most powerful storms when it landed here in the summer. And four months later the scars have barely begun to heal.
Debris still litters the roadways, destroyed homes line the beachfront and hundreds of residents remain displaced. This sliver of land, the last frontier of humanity before the open ocean, is used to taking hits from extreme weather. But Ida was the worst in the island’s history. Sears, a 70 year old with a white handlebar moustache, contracted pneumonia and staph infections in both his eyes after his six weeks living outdoors. He was rushed to hospital and told he may not survive. But after nine days of treatment, he made it out in mid-November. “I believe the Lord was looking down on me,” he said, sitting outside as a sea breeze passed over his new trailer home, a few feet from the beach. The retiree, who lives on social security payments, was one of the first to move into this row of temporary Fema homes, sheltering dozens of the island’s residents who have lost everything.
With his long term prospects still uncertain, Sears was living day by day. “One day at a time,” he said. “I’m going to stay right here for now. I’ll save some money. And one day, hopefully, I can buy the trailer.” This post-storm purgatory was felt among many, who are preparing for an uncertain new year as Grand Isle continues to grapple with a gargantuan recovery effort. Adriane Cunningham, a patrol officer with the island police force, was living in a trailer a few down from Sears. Her home was crushed by two trees ripped from their roots by Ida. She had been living without insurance and had already spent over $3,000 just to remove the debris. She had no idea how much it would cost to rebuild or if she even could. “It seems like every time we do something with the house, something else goes wrong with it,” she said. “It’s just so much money.” For now, she splits her time between the trailer during the week and her sister’s house, three and a half hours away, at the weekend. Her five children have been withdrawn from the local school district and moved to a school outside of the state capitol, Baton Rouge. The family simply cannot fit inside the trailer.
141 households on Grand Isle applied for Fema housing in the wake of the storm, with 42 still waiting on approval or unit availability, said Jefferson parish fire director Bryan Adams, who is overseeing local government reconstruction efforts. Ida came ashore with pummeling 150mph winds, damaging every structure on the island. Local officials estimate around 700 buildings, a quarter of the island’s constructions, have either been destroyed or will need to be completely demolished. Many are homes constructed before Hurricane Katrina. Less than 400 people have returned to live.
There is progress, but it has been gradual. Electricity returned to the island in October, and thicker pylons with deeper foundations have been installed. But there are still regular outages, and Grand Isle is still being powered by generator energy and remains unconnected to the grid. Running water has also returned, but a boil water advisory remains in place. Gas connections are sporadic, with some on the island still living without. Some of the most devastating damage was done to the island’s levee protection system. The Gulf coastline on Grand Isle is enveloped by a so-called “burrito levee”, a 13 foot tall sand-filled tube that sits at the back of the beach. It was breached at multiple locations, flooding much of the island and leaving thick dunes of sand over six foot high. Standing on top of the winding burrito, where rips in the tubing are exposed to the afternoon sun, Grand Isle’s Cajun mayor David Camardelle spoke of the battles he has fought since Ida hit. “Everything is a fight,” he said “A fight to save our community.” Camardelle is in the process of lobbying not only to hasten the levees repair but to increase protection from the devastating storm surge further out at sea. He pointed to the horizon where, on certain parts of the landscape, clusters of breakwater boulders are placed out at sea. Camardelle argues that the devastation to the west of the island was intensified as there is no breakwater protection in certain areas, meaning the surge from the sea is stronger. He is lobbying the US army corps of engineers to invest in new construction, but with an estimated $50m price tag his efforts are not certain to go forward.
With hundreds of homes requiring demolition, the levees in a state of disrepair, Grand Isle already finds itself in a race against time to prepare for the 2022 hurricane season. Amid coastal erosion and rising sea levels, all exacerbated by the climate crisis, which has already triggered more frequent and devastating storms, has Camardelle considered whether he is fighting a losing battle? “No,” he said. “This is a community. We’re families and we all know each other. What made me run for office was to save this island.” Camardelle is an incumbent since 1997. His grandfather, a shrimp and crab fisherman, moved to Grand Isle in 1947; his mother, in her late 80s along with his uncles, aunts and children all live on the island. Like many other island advocates, Camardelle pointed to the fact that Grand Isle frequently takes the first punch from extreme storms, cushioning the blow for larger populations, like New Orleans and Baton Rouge further inland. One of the mayor’s lifelong friends, Bennie Gatz, a local mosquito terminator who lives close to the beach and is an embodiment of the required hardiness to exist out on the frontiers. At 70 years old, Gatz, like most residents evacuated during the storm, but returned after running water was restored to his home. He is a dialysis patient, but attempted nonetheless to repair his stilted home himself. Much of the porch had been destroyed and inside the drywall was covered in mold. But soon after returning he slipped on the wooden stairs and broke both his legs in two places. With the nearest hospital, Lady of the Sea, closed following damage sustained by Ida, Gatz was forced to travel for an hour and half by ambulance in severe pain to the nearest functioning emergency room in the town of Thibodaux. They put both his legs in casts, and he left in a wheelchair. He returned straight back to the island, a place he says he will never leave. There’s still no gas at his home, so he relies on hot meal handouts from the local government and has hired some friends to assist with the rebuild. “It’s a unique place,” he said. “I love the tales of old pirates. I love the fishing; trout, redfish, you name it. “You have to be extremely resilient,” he said. “And you have to love it here.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/hurricane-ida-louisiana-grand-isle-still-reeling-months-later
5862;5862;It’s the great green reset: 10 things Britain can do now to save the planet | John Vidal;2022-01-03T08:00:41Z;['John Vidal'];['Climate crisis', 'Cop26', 'Biodiversity', 'Environment', 'UK news', 'World news'];"So that was it? One great heave of climate diplomacy at Cop26 in Glasgow and we can go back to normal? No: 2021 was one of the hottest years on record, coal is booming, emissions surging and we are well on track for climate catastrophe. We need an immediate post-Cop climate reset now because the job is far from done. Britain remains president of the UN climate body for another year and is expected by the rest of the world to lead by example at least until we hand over to Egypt in November. Indeed, 2022 is probably more important than 2021 because the gap between rhetoric and action is vast and must now be closed. So here, culled from groups like Friends of the Earth and Carbon Brief, global bodies like the UN, International Monetary Fund and World Bank, as well as the Welsh and Scottish governments, is the reset. It would be popular, cost little, greatly improve millions of lives and restore Britain’s reputation as a progressive country. 1. Announce an end to North Sea oil and gas exploration. Hardly any oil extracted from wells on the UK seabed ever gets to a UK-based refinery, let alone a British car or boiler. It’s mostly exported, earns the government little, but adds vastly to emissions and the wealth of foreign-owned corporations. We could announce an immediate end to exploration and few people would even notice. Along with the expected end of UK coal power in 2022, it would be a powerful signal to the world that the era of fossil fuels was ending. 2. Ditch fossil fuel subsidies. Despite pledges, progress at Cop26 to abolish or reduce the $420bn (£313bn) spent each year by governments on subsidies for the fossil fuel industry was incremental at best, and is already being watered down. Britain spends billions a year propping up the polluting industries but less than a 10th of that goes to support renewable energy. Whatever the imminent high court ruling on the legality of government fuel subsidies, the UK could immediately level the playing field, and save billions by not encouraging the wasteful use of energy which mostly benefits the rich. 3. Protect nature. The most important meeting in 2022 will be in China in April when all countries meet to finish negotiating new goals to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. Many have already said they plan to protect 30% of the planet’s land and oceans but have failed abysmally in the past to meet even minimal targets, so are not to be trusted. Covid has shown how climate, biodiversity and human health depend on each other, so Britain could be the first to act boldly by translating all global goals into law.
4. Stop adding to deforestation. There are plans to clean up the UK’s supply chains to help protect forests and reduce climate emissions, but they will not stop companies buying from legal deforestation and they do not address human rights abuses. The proposals could be easily tightened. 5. Slow steaming. The 2008 financial crisis forced shipowners to cut fuel bills and many chose to reduce the speed of their ships. As a result, CO2 emissions were simply, if inadvertently, reduced by nearly 200m tonnes, or about what a country like the Netherlands emits a year. The UK could work with others to press the International Maritime Organization to adopt ocean speed limits. This would greatly reduce air pollution, cut the cost of cruise holidays and save billions of tonnes of carbon over the next decades. 6. Keep changing behaviour. Thanks to Covid, climate anxiety and conviction, people are shifting diets away from meat and dairy, cutting back on flying and pledging to change carbon-polluting habits. Schools, institutions, companies and individuals can all help increase demand for climate-friendly, plastic-free consumerism. 7. Scrap most transport plans. The £24bn roads programme, the £1.2bn Silvertown tunnel in London, much of the £96bn HS2 project and proposals for many new runways and airport expansions are not needed, will add to emissions and could be shelved without much complaint. The money saved would allow the government to concentrate on popular, sustainable public transport schemes. The UK is going in the opposite direction to most countries which are prioritising affordable rail travel, cycling and walking. The financial, health and carbon savings of a radical change in transport direction would be immense. 8. Confront the building industry. New regulations due to come into effect in 2022 are intended to reduce carbon emissions from new-build homes by about 30% compared with current standards. But a more ambitious Future Homes Standard, which aims to make all new buildings “net zero ready”, will not come into force until 2025 and the government has a long and bad record of bowing to industry pressure to weaken plans. 9. Insulate, insulate. A major programme to promote household solar, increase electric car-buying, better insulate all homes and switch to renewables could galvanise many industries, reduce soaring energy bills, improve health and dramatically cut emissions. 10. Keep the promises we have made. For all the fine words at Glasgow and the “net zero” and other pledges, countries do not have the policies in place. The priority for the UK is to make the net zero target legally binding and help other countries deliver on their promises rather than to widen the gap between targets and delivery. That’s some list. We must be realistic, but also ambitious. Achieving just a half of all that would be something Britain could be proud of when it hands the Cop climate baton to Africa next year. But the reset must start now. John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/03/great-green-reset-10-things-britain-save-planet-cop26
5863;5863;Purity, passion, drama: darts’ renaissance continues in tournament for the ages | Sean Ingle;2022-01-03T08:00:41Z;['Sean Ingle'];['PDC World Championships', 'Darts', 'Sport'];"Forty years ago this month, at the height of darts’ first great tungsten rush, Jocky Wilson left Jollees nightclub in Stoke clutching a world title and a cheque for £6,500 – about £26,000 in today’s money. It is a measure of the sport’s renewed popularity that whoever lifts the PDC World Championship trophy on Monday night will pocket £500,000. And while the final ‘Oi, Oi, Ois’ are yet to ring out across Alexandra Palace, it is already safe to hail this year’s tournament as a vintage edition. When Michael Smith outpowered Jonny Clayton in a last 16 final-set tiebreak it was instantly hailed as a game for the ages. But such was the quality in so many subsequent matches, including Smith’s 5-4 victory against the world No 1, Gerwyn Price and Peter Wright’s 6-4 slugfest over Gary Anderson – during which Wright hit 24 180s, a record for a world championship match – it may not even have been the best encounter of the week.
Meanwhile a nine-dart finish was once so rare that in 1982 the sponsors offered £52,000 for anyone who could land it – eight times bigger than the winner’s prize. No one did. Yet when Price achieved the feat against Smith on Saturday it was the third of the tournament – a record. An average of a million people watched last year’s final. Would anyone be surprised if that figure was surpassed on Monday when Wright faces off against Smith? So what accounts for the popularity of darts? To these eyes its pleasures come from its purity – dart and board, eye and nerve – combined with its unremitting pressures. After all, there are few sports where the gap between perfection and failure is so slim; where the adrenaline surge of hitting a 180 can so abruptly morph into a public shaming if three darts for a double are spurned; where a player must think, to calculate where to throw next, but not overthink, as then the tension and heckling will buckle the mind with doubt. It is a sport with so many momentum shifts it could be played on a seesaw. And at the highest levels, when players throw for a leg or set or match every 90 seconds or so, darts becomes almost a combat sport. True, an opponent cannot hit. But they can constantly wound. It perhaps helps that darts remains a sport where you don’t have to be fast-tracked into an academy, or born with a silver spoon in your mouth. The Scottish player Peter Wright was a tyre fitter before making it as a professional in his mid-30s. His compatriot Gary Anderson, his opponent in Sunday’s semi-final, was a builder. With their pot bellies and tattoos, they look more like us than most elite sports stars.
Longevity, too, may play a part: incredibly Paul Lim, “the Singapore Slinger” who played alongside Wilson in 1982 was still good enough to play in this year’s world championship at 67. Wilson, of course, was the ultimate darting rags-to-riches-and-back-to-rags story. He grew up in desperate poverty, including years in a children’s home, before he began playing in the mid-1970s while on the dole. Famously he had no teeth. Early in his career his dentures fell out during a match and in the excitement he trod on them. When the Observer went to the 1980 world championship they found Wilson wandering about with “cans of beers in his pocket, needing a shave, and with bits of dried fruit in his pockets”. At one point a girl from the sponsor Embassy gave the players 200 cigarettes each for the night. “They smoke so many free fags all the week that they are coughing their hearts up by the end of it,” our man noted – including Wilson, who played with a cigarette lodged in his non‑throwing hand. But Wilson could play, and how. Two years later he beat John Lowe in the 1982 final despite arguments with the press, leaving the stage in tears after a row with Alun Evans, and the roof of his council house in Kirkcaldy collapsing during the tournament. “It was not a particularly good final,” Matthew Engel wrote in these pages. “Lowe was off by a millimetre or so, and millimetres are more significant in darts than in any sport except mountaineering.” That victory allowed Wilson to buy a house of his own. Tragically over the years his drinking (the commentator Sid Waddell famously quipped that Wilson would “win darts matches when other people would have been in intensive care”) took its toll and the Scot ended his days back in the council estate where he grew up.
Meanwhile a sport that was once the sole preserve of pubs and working men’s clubs is now attracting interest from academics. One recent study examined 29,381 matches and found that, if both players could win the match with just one dart, performance at youth and amateur level worsened by 10%‑26%, while for professionals it dropped less than 1%. That is a striking finding given the abuse that top players face at crunch moments. It has been particularly bad in this 2021 tournament, with the sozzled crowd telling the Welshman Price that he was “a sheep-shagging bastard” and barracking and booing non-English players. The unwillingness of the announcers to properly call it out remains a lingering stain. Meanwhile another study showed observers could accurately decipher how a top darts player would throw based on their body language. Typically, faces showed more expression and anxiety – with preparation times shorter – before a poor throw than before a good one. Of course darts has its detractors. But even they would have to accept that a sport that has zig-zagged from boom to bust, schism to lengthy separation, and from resuscitation to renaissance over the past four decades is booming, and now as much a part of the Christmas and New Year furniture as hangovers and failed resolutions.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/03/darts-pdc-world-championship
5864;5864;US intelligence errors helped build myth of Nazi Alpine redoubt, says historian;2022-01-03T08:00:41Z;['Philip Oltermann'];['Second world war', 'US news', 'Nazism', 'World news', 'History books'];"A US spymaster inadvertently helped the Nazis develop one of the most effective disinformation campaigns of the second world war by spreading rumours about Hitler’s plans for a Where Eagles Dare-style Alpine redoubt, a historian with access to classified US military records has found. The myth that the Nazis were amassing weapons and crack units of 100,000 fanatical soldiers in the spring of 1945 for a last stand in the Austro-Bavarian Alps was without any basis in fact but had a powerful hold on the imagination of American and British military leaders, who feared it could prolong the war for years. Thomas Boghardt, a German historian at the US Army Center of Military History in Washington DC, argues in a new book that the myth of an Alpine Nazi fortress was not a crucial factor behind American forces abandoning the race to Berlin in favour of a southward push but was one that US spycraft had a hand in making. The Nazi leadership first got wind of allied fears of a mountaintop last stand in 1944, after the SS’s intelligence service intercepted a cable sent from the US embassy in Berne, Switzerland. As Boghardt shows in Covert Legions: US Army Intelligence in Germany 1944-1949, the message had most likely been sent by Allen Dulles, later the head of the CIA during the Bay of Pigs invasion fiasco but at the time the Berne station chief for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS).
British intelligence had discovered that the special cipher used to secure Dulles’s communications had been compromised, but the American spymaster continued to ignore their warnings, driving one irate British agent to despair. “[C]ould you report to the fool [Dulles] who knows his code was compromised if he has used that code to report meetings with anyone, Germans probably identified persons concerned and use them for stuffing [disinformation]”, the agent vented to his station chief. “He swallows easily.” As the British had feared, Goebbels’s propaganda ministry would spend the following months building up the myth of a German defence effort in Austria and Bavaria via disinformation and media reports, hoping a sidetracked US military leadership could be drawn into separate peace talks or even an alliance against the Soviets. “Dulles was a very capable case officer who excelled at working with human sources, but when it came to signals intelligence he was indeed highly negligent,” Boghardt told the Guardian. As Covert Legions shows, allied forces were extremely susceptible to disinformation campaigns in the final stages of the war, with Field Marshal Montgomery arrested at one point as an impostor by American guards following a rumour that the Germans were planning to impersonate the British commander. After the end of the war, Nazis setting themselves up on snowy mountaintops became a staple of swashbuckling war movies, such as 1968’s Where Eagles Dare, starring Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. However, while some allied intelligence reports explicitly cited the Alpine redoubt theory as an argument for an allied push into southern Germany in 1945, Boghardt rejects the idea that it played a crucial part in shaping the second world war endgame and setting the ground for cold war tensions with the Soviet Union, as Winston Churchill later claimed. The US decision not to back a British plan for a “pencil-like thrust” to Berlin likely owed more to the fact that the Red Army was already within 20 miles of the German capital while Anglo-American forces were still 300 miles away, he said, and a deal to divide up the city had already been agreed. “My impression is that the US command ultimately didn’t really believe in the Alpine redoubt myth, but may have kept it alive to persuade the British of their overriding strategy.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/us-intelligence-errors-helped-build-myth-of-nazi-alpine-redoubt-says-historian
5865;5865;Antonio Brown’s latest misdeed will only stick because it happened on TV | Melissa Jacobs;2022-01-03T08:00:40Z;['Melissa Jacobs'];['NFL', 'Tampa Bay Buccaneers', 'Sport', 'US sports'];"In a normal universe, we’d be solely focused on the final minutes of a drama-filled classic between the Buccaneers and Jets. We’d gush over Tom Brady’s game-winning drive that again ripped whatever semblance of hope remains in New York’s long-suffering fans. We’d marvel at Brady’s unmistakable precision with under two minutes, culminating in his cool-as-a-cucumber delivery on a 33-yard touchdown strike to Cyril Grayson that left not nearly enough time for Zach Wilson to respond. We’d question Robert Saleh’s decision to go for it on fourth-and-2 at the Bucs’ seven-yard line instead of kicking a field goal that would opened a seven-point lead with two minutes to spare. Instead, this game will be remembered for a different brand of dramatic: Antonio Brown adding to his endless list of disturbing antics. In the third quarter, with the Tampa Bay offense on the field mid-drive, a visibly furious Brown removed his jersey on the sideline, threw his shoulder pads down, then cascaded across the end zone, tore off his tank top, threw the tank and a glove with vigor into a sea of Jets fans, then continued shirtless into the tunnel with one final peace sign before fading to black.
It was a scene so bizarre and rare that reportedly MetLife Stadium security thought the shirtless man was a fan and were about to tackle him until they realized it was the seven-time Pro Bowl wide receiver. The game continued and, perhaps not coincidentally, the Bucs started mounting their comeback. Brown’s antics made a mockery of his team, of Brady who been his No 1 advocate – some might say enabler – and of course himself. Again. All because, according to Fox’s Jay Glazer, Bucs coach Bruce Arians asked Brown to come into the game.
It was too much even for Arians who moments after the game declared that Brown “is no longer a Buc”. As Brown has personified like no other, you can get away with pretty much anything in the NFL if you have talent. You can be an accused rapist, rob a delivery truck, and fake a vaccination card. You can quit on your previous teams. Too many coaches, Arians included, believe it will different when they get a hold of a troubled player with natural ability. But even Arians reached a point with Brown after the fake vaccination card stunt where he was unable to sugarcoat the situation by pretending Brown was a changed man, or that he would go to therapy, or that he deserved his umpteenth chance for whatever other reason. When asked about Brown’s return from suspension and how people would react to giving him yet another opportunity after Arians had previously said Brown only had one chance, the frustrated coach responded: “I could give a shit what they think, the only thing I care about is this football team.”
Translation: Antonio Brown can help us win football games, full stop. Well, Brown won’t be helping the Bucs anymore because, less than two weeks after his return from suspension, he finally found a rule to break that will be judged more seriously than his many graver off-field misdeeds. He quit on his team on live television. Everyone saw it, so unlike his other, more serious alleged acts, his enablers can’t hide behind lame excuses. This was not mutual. He was not provoked. No one is trying to extort money from him. Blah, blah, blah. Brown is, simply put, not a person who respects, well, anything. He remains, however, a damn good football player. In his previous three games before the shirtless farewell in New York, he amassed over 300 receiving yards and three touchdowns. Brown figured to be a key contributor for the Bucs as they defended their Super Bowl title defense in the playoffs, especially with Chris Godwin out for the season. The loss of Godwin and necessary ousting of Brown will make the Bucs chances of a repeat much slimmer. But at least the Tampa Bay locker room has rid itself of an immeasurable amount of toxicity. Hopefully, for the sake of all the people Brown has tormented, this will truly be the final straw in his NFL career. Video of the week A FedExField railing came crumbling down in Dan Snyder’s sorry excuse for a stadium but luckily Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts, fresh off a 20-16 win that by day’s end lifted the Eagles back into the playoffs, was there to save the day.
MVP(s) of the week Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, Cincinnati Bengals. One glance at Burrow’s and Chase’s stat lines (446 passing yards, four TDs and no INTs for Burrow, 266 receiving yards and three TDs for Chase) and you might think they were still at LSU beating up on some hapless Division II patsy. Instead, this explosion of offense came against the Kansas City Chiefs, who have been one of the NFL’s stoutest defenses this season. Burrow and Chase put the rest of the AFC on notice that the connection we saw in spades during the middle of the season is back and better than ever.
The Bengals’ gutsy 34-31 win came after being down two scores down. More importantly, it clinched the AFC North for Cincinnati, an incredible feat for a team that finished in the division cellar last season. Burrow did give Bengals supporters a slight scare when he came up favoring his right knee and sat out for the game’s final play, but we’re all set to declare him healthy. Stat of the week Bill Belichick records his 20th season with at least 10 wins. It rained points for New England early and often in a dominating 50-10 win over the hapless Jaguars. With the win, Belichick tied Don Shula as the only coaches in NFL history to achieve 10 wins in 20 separate seasons. Belichick acknowledged the feat after the game though wasn’t exactly self-congratulatory, “Players win games … fortunate to coach a lot of great players,” he told reporters. “I’ve been lucky.” Belichick returns to the postseason after a one-year hiatus, thanks in large part to the quick maturation of Mac Jones. Jones was again efficient, completing 22 of 30 passes for 227 yards and three touchdowns. Conversely, Trevor Lawrence was erratic and threw three picks. Lawrence has shown signs of living up to the hype this season though probably less than most expected. But it’s hard not to ponder what Lawrence’s rookie season would have looked like had he been under steady hands like Belichick and Josh McDaniels and not inside the Urban Meyer trainwreck. Quote of the week “I wasn’t good enough today. We weren’t good enough today. That’s why the result was what it was.” – Mike McCarthy, following Dallas’s 25-22 loss to Arizona There were myriad reasons the Cowboys lost on Sunday but none loom as large as McCarthy’s horrific clock management. McCarthy had no timeouts left on the Cardinals’ final drive, thus was unable to challenge what appeared to be an obvious delay of game and, more importantly, a fumble. (The fumble occurred right before the two-minute warning, after which it would have been under automatic review. ) Elsewhere around the league • The Dolphins’ seven-game win streak came to a dramatic halt as the Titans shellacked Miami 34-3 to not only clinch the AFC South but move into the No 1 seed in the AFC (by virtue of KC’s loss). Ryan Tannehill was efficient against his former team, but the Dolphins truly had no answer for D’Onta Foreman’s 132 yards and a score on 26 carries. Tennessee’s defense continues to be a revelation. The Dolphins, like most Titans opponents of late, struggled to both run and convert big plays.
• Rookie Trey Lance succeeded in his second start of the season as San Francisco bested Houston 23-7. It was a ho-hum performance for Lance in the first half as the offense struggled to generate momentum. But he came alive in the second, tossing two touchdowns including a beauty to Deebo Samuel. Having the 49ers’ defense pitch a shutout in the second half was a nice bonus. Despite the win, Kyle Shanahan quickly declared that Jimmy Garoppolo, who is nursing a thumb injury, will reclaim his starter role as soon as he is healthy. The 49ers can clinch a playoff spot with a win next week or a New Orleans loss. • The Raiders’ 23-20 win over Indianapolis was the first time this season a team beat Indy after allowing Jonathan Taylor to rush for over 100 yards. Now the Raiders have a pivotal matchup against the Chargers in Week 18 with the winner clinching a wild-card berth. • Las Vegas’s win was also a nice punctuation mark on an afternoon in which the life and influence of John Madden was widely celebrated with a moment of silence in every NFL stadium. • The Rams’ offense struggled mightily against a beaten-up Ravens secondary but came alive late to give Los Angeles a come-from-behind 20-19 win over a gutsy Ravens squad. A win in the NFL is always a glorious thing but Sean McVay has to be concerned about Matthew Stafford’s propensity for throwing the ball to the wrong team. Sunday’s two-interception game marked the fourth time this season that Stafford has thrown multiple picks.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/antonio-brown-bizarre-exit-tampa-bay
5866;5866;Kleptoparasitic bear steals wolves’ kill in filmed Yellowstone drama;2022-01-03T07:30:40Z;['Richard Luscombe'];['Animals', 'Wildlife', 'Environment', 'Conservation', 'National parks', 'World news', 'US news'];"Wildlife officials in Yellowstone national park captured the “unusual” sight of a cheeky grizzly bear tagging along with a pack of hunting wolves, then making off with their kill.
The enthralling video, posted to the National Parks Service Facebook page, shows the October incident in which the wolves from the Junction Butte pack in northern Yellowstone were joined by a lumbering grizzly as they hunted a herd of elk. After the wolves take down an elk, the bear moves in and steals the carcass: a phenomenon known as kleptoparasitism, or parasitism by theft, in which one species steals resources, usually food, from another. The Yellowstone incident was unusual, the NPS said, because wolves and bears usually compete for food and hunt separately. While bears stealing food wolves have captured is not uncommon, in this case the bear decided its best interests were served by actively joining the hunt. “From the bear’s perspective, it takes a lot of energy to follow a wolf pack around, but the reward is high if it successfully takes over a carcass,” the NPS said. “A fresh elk carcass is a wonderful source of fat and protein for a grizzly bear preparing for hibernation. This bear seems to have figured out that following the wolves in the morning will increase its chances of encountering a high-calorie meal.” The wolves were forced to wait until the bear had finished its meal before taking advantage of their own kill. “Typically, wolves will yield to incoming bears,” the NPS said. “Since hunting is dangerous and often unsuccessful, it’s better for wolves to wait their turn at a carcass that has been usurped by a bear than it is for them to continue hunting.” Previous videos from Yellowstone show wolves and bears confronting each other. In one episode, filmed in 2019, a tour guide captured close-up images of a grizzly defending itself from a pack of wolves trying to reclaim an elk carcass. Yellowstone is home to about 123 gray wolves, the NPS says, with 90% of their winter diet consisting of elk. The park, spanning parts of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, also has about 150 grizzly bears, listed as a threatened species in 1975. A federal judge restored protections for grizzlies in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem in September 2018, after the US Fish and Wildlife Service, claiming a “remarkable recovery”, delisted the species a year earlier.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/kleptoparasitic-bear-steals-wolves-kill-yellowstone
5867;5867;Scary Monsters by Michelle de Kretser review – anger, alarm and satirical glee ;2022-01-03T07:00:41Z;['Anthony Cummins'];['Fiction', 'Books', 'Culture'];"Michelle de Kretser’s slyly intelligent sixth novel pairs two first-person narratives. One takes place in a dystopian near-future Melbourne, where Lyle, an immigrant father of two, is employed by the state to write sinister-sounding “evaluations” nominating fellow migrants for arrest and repatriation; the other half of the book is set in 1981 and follows Lili, a 22-year-old Australian working as a teaching assistant in France, prior to postgraduate literary study in Oxford. It’s typical of De Kretser’s sophistication that she leaves the link between these narratives entirely up to you – even the order in which they are to be read is left to the individual reader, given the book’s reversible, Kindle-defying two-way design. I plunged straight into Lili’s intimately conversational reminiscence of running with a circle of young Europeans attached to her Montpellier lycée, in particular Minna, who takes a year out of art school in London to tag along with her boyfriend Nick. Lili struggles for cash, has problems with her landlord and neighbour, and faces everyday racism (her family emigrated to Australia from Asia, like De Kretser, who was born in Sri Lanka). She can’t help but fall for Minna and Nick’s rackety aura of entitled glamour, not least when she learns that Nick is at work on a novel, something it never occurred to her she could do, even as an aspiring scholar under the spell of Simone de Beauvoir.
As the three knock around together, Lili’s story unfolds as a coming-of-age vignette portraying the lonely restlessness of unfocused sexual desire and shapeless creative ambition. Regular moments of comedy erupt, especially when Lili joins Minna en route to Italy to visit John Berger’s mistress (apparently an acquaintance of Minna’s mother), where various mid-trip lunch options are rejected as bourgeois until Minna alights on a suitably authentic workers’ restaurant, only to balk at what’s on the menu. Yet there’s steel, too, in De Kretser’s portrait of the chilly welcome Lili receives having arrived into the bosom of the western culture that has defined her intellectual interests. When Lili’s section ends in a moment of collective rapture at the election of François Mitterrand’s socialist party, there’s an immediate shift in tone for the reader, who then turns the book 180 degrees to begin the plottier, more urgent thread set in Lyle’s Australia. Here there are hoverboards, yes, but three-figure-factor sun cream is the norm, much of Sydney is underwater and Islamic worship is banned as a terrorist activity under a suite of laws targeting minorities.
As a civil servant who is also a migrant, Lyle recognises that he’s a hair’s breadth from falling foul of the authoritarian powers he helps enforce. When he speaks of a wind that “cuts as if it’s factory-fresh from Gillette”, it’s a mark of De Kretser’s cleverness just how psychologically acute the line feels, almost as if Lyle is trying too hard to signal his buy-in in order to pass without attracting suspicion. The plot turns on cranked-up domestic strife, as Lyle’s go-getting wife sets out to exploit recent euthanasia legislation to kill off his mother and liquidate her assets to move to a new area better suited to the circles they aspire to. There’s an affinity here with the type of story found in George Saunders’s Tenth of December, whose speakers unwittingly reveal the disturbing norms they have assimilated without question. Much of the energy comes from the way De Kretser lets us piece together the precise nature of her climate-ravaged hellscape, as when Lyle speaks casually of prepping his cattle prod before walking to his car at night. De Kretser’s previous novel, 2018’s The Life to Come, also comprised discrete segments, and as in that book, there’s a certain riddling quality here. While the doomy tendency of Lyle’s segment all but snuffs out the heady sense of possibility captured in Lili’s thread, the book’s overriding sense of anger and alarm also mingles with satirical glee. Even if she obviously has the apocalyptic drift of the present in sight, De Kretser passes on to the reader the inescapable feeling that she’s also having fun, in this engaging amalgam of lament and warning shot.

5868;5868;‘I want Mickey by Toni Basil played at my funeral’: Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s honest playlist;2022-01-03T07:00:40Z;['Elle Hunt'];['Sophie Ellis-Bextor', 'Music', 'Culture'];"The first single that I ever bought Our House by Madness. I was four, so the actual purchase was instigated by my father. He was such a big music fan and wanted to make sure that I knew this was the first song I was buying. I still adore it. In 2020’s lockdown, we did Kitchen Discos: I sang on my Instagram with the kids. After 10 weeks, I chose to close the whole thing with Our House. It celebrates the glory and chaos of family life.
*** The song that is my karaoke go-to I used to sing Shoop by Salt-N-Pepa, and it’s really fun to do the rap – but when you do a karaoke version, the backing track is quite slow, so you get people looking a bit concerned for you as you trip your way through it. Basically, what you want is a people-pleaser. The one I go to is Faith by George Michael. It just always works.
*** The song I’ve streamed the most In the days of having an Alexa, the ruler of the roost is my little one, Mickey. He’s two, and he will get a passion for a song and just play it over and over. For a while it was Let’s Get Loud by Jennifer Lopez; now we’ve progressed to In Da Getto by Skrillex and J Balvin. He likes his heavy dance and his reggaeton as well. It could be a lot worse. *** The best song to play at a party If you want something a bit slinky, Grace Jones – Pull Up to the Bumper. But if you’re trying to entice people to the dancefloor, then I’d probably go disco. Thelma Houston’s Don’t Leave Me This Way is very seductive.
*** The best song to have sex to For music that’s got that undercurrent of “the man singing wants you to get saucy”, it’s got to be Darling Nikki by Prince – you’re not reading between the lines with that one. Kiss has got lots of flirtation, too. Gett Off would be my top one. *** The song I want played at my funeral The one that I’ve said since I was really small is Mickey by Toni Basil – which, I grant you, is going to be quite weird. It came out when I was about two, and it made a big impression on me. It’s got such urgency and passion and it’s a little bit off-kilter. It’s probably not one of the Top 100 hits for funerals, but I think of it as “one of my songs”.
*** The song I pretend to hate that I secretly like I’m not really afraid of saying what I like. I don’t believe in guilty pleasures. The things I say are my favourites are my favourites. There’s a song that came out by Rufus Wainwright song, Peaceful Afternoon, that’s just so beautiful. I like Everything Now by Arcade Fire, Harmony Hall by Vampire Weekend.
*** The song that is my actual favourite It depends what mood you’re in. But some songs are just pretty perfect. Something like Wichita Lineman [by Glen Campbell], it’s a very beautiful song – just glorious. It sounds wistful and captures the purity of wanting to find that connection with someone: you’re sending out your message to them. That’s all of us, isn’t it? Hoping that someone’s on the line. Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s Kitchen Disco is available on BBC Sounds.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/03/i-want-mickey-by-toni-basil-played-at-my-funeral-sophie-ellis-bextors-honest-playlist
5869;5869;New year’s resolutions: how to get into the habit of saving;2022-01-03T07:00:40Z;['Rupert Jones'];['Money', 'Savings', 'Banks and building societies', 'Savings rates', 'Consumer affairs', 'UK news', 'Isas'];"Pay off costly debts first There is no point trying to save if you are burdened by costly debts. The average easy access savings account offers less than 0.2% interest, while on some borrowing you could be paying in excess of 20%. Aim to pay off expensive credit card, store card or overdraft debts before you think about putting money aside. Start a rainy-day fund Everyone should aim to have some cash in an easily accessible savings account to provide a financial safety net if the worst happens.
“We all need robust savings to cope with the nasty surprises life tends to throw at us,” says Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. “We should be working towards three to six months’ worth of essential expenses in an easy access account.” Essential expenses should include items such as housing costs, money for food and important bills. Do not be put off by how much this comes to – anything you can put away towards it will help if things do go wrong. Have a goal Beyond rainy-day savings, you may want to put aside other cash – and having a purpose will motivate you. “Setting a goal and giving it a name can help keep you on track,” says Annabelle Williams, a personal finance specialist at the investment firm Nutmeg. “By attaching meaning to your savings goals, such as a new home, a specific trip, or big purchase, you’re more likely to stick to your savings habit.” Make it a regular habit
Regular savings accounts are a good option for those new to saving. You put aside money each month – usually via a standing order from your current account. These accounts offer some of the best interest rates out there, although the maximum you can tuck away often isn’t that high. If you have a NatWest current account, you can take advantage of its Digital Regular Saver account, which pays a market-leading 3% interest and is, it says, designed to help customers with little or no savings develop a savings habit and build financial capability. However, you can only pay in up to £50 each month. TSB’s Monthly Saver pays 2% and lets you save between £25 and £125 a month – again, you need to have a current account with the bank to open one. Most regular savings accounts run for a year, and the interest is paid at the end of the period. You will then need to shop around for a new account for your lump sum. Get some help For those on a low income, the government’s Help to Save account is definitely worth considering. It lets certain people on working tax credit, or receiving universal credit, get a bonus of 50p for every £1 they save over four years. You can put in between £1 and £50 each month, and the most you can earn in four years is £1,200 in bonus money. But paying into this account could affect some people’s eligibility for benefits and how much they get, so read the details carefully before you commit.
Then there’s the lifetime Isa, which lets people save for a property or retirement. You can put away up to £4,000 each year until you are 50, and the government will add a 25% bonus to your savings, up to a maximum of £1,000 a year. To open one you must be aged 18 to 39. Round up your spending … Several banks are making saving easier by getting you to do it whenever you pay for something. Lloyds Bank has Save the Change. When you buy something with your debit card, if your account is in credit it will round up the amount spent to the nearest pound, and transfer the difference into a nominated Lloyds savings account. “If a purchase is £2.20, the bank will transfer 80p, which could see someone save £5.60 in a week if this is spent every day,” says Rachel Springall at the financial data provider Moneyfacts. The digital bank Chase does the same and deposits the small change into a separate account where it will earn interest at 5% for 12 months. … or round it down Another technique is to log into your current account, look at the balance and mentally “round it down”, Williams says. “If you have £221.60 until payday, round it down to £210 and move £11.60 into savings. It all adds up over time.” Use an app Chip and Plum are just two of the apps that offer “auto-save” features. Every few days the tech does the maths and automatically transfers some of your money into another account, which little by little adds up. Plum’s free option includes auto-saving, while Chip is changing its pricing in mid-January so that standard membership will be free.
A budgeting app could also help. Springall suggests Money Dashboard, which automatically categorises spending into “buckets”, such as household bills and groceries – this lets you see what you can afford to save once the essentials are covered. Another budgeting app to check out is Emma, which analyses transactions across accounts and classifies them into spending categories. “Great budgeting starts with careful planning and reliable insights,” its website promises. Fix for a better return Some of the best interest rates are offered by fixed-rate savings accounts, where you typically tie up your money for a year or more. Of course, that won’t suit everyone. At the time of writing, you could get about 1.3% on a one-year fixed-rate bond, about 1.6% on a two-year bond, and about 2.1% on a five-year bond. For the latest rates, keep a close eye on Moneyfacts’ tables.
Switch current account If your current account isn’t cutting the mustard, you can get some free cash – enough, perhaps, to kick off a nest egg – by moving it to a new provider. Many banks pay £100-plus if you move to them. Nationwide will give you up to £125 if you are a member and switch to its FlexDirect current account. If you are not yet a member, it is £100. Meanwhile, HSBC is offering £150 if you move to its Advance or Premier accounts. Typically, the money is paid into the current account you have switched to, shortly after the move has been completed. You can then use this cash to start a new savings account or boost an existing one.";https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/03/new-years-resolutions-saving-interest-budgeting
5870;5870;Ex-NFL star Herschel Walker posts baffling video promoting US Senate run;2022-01-03T07:00:39Z;['Martin Pengelly'];['Republicans', 'US midterm elections 2022', 'Georgia', 'US politics', 'US news', 'US Senate', 'US Congress', 'World news', 'US domestic policy', 'NFL'];"Herschel Walker has Donald Trump’s endorsement in the race for US Senate in Georgia but the former NFL star may be struggling to counter fears from some Republicans that he could damage the party’s chances of taking back a seat lost in 2020, and with it the Senate itself.
In December, the former University of Georgia and Dallas Cowboys running back admitted he does not have a college degree – having repeatedly said that he did. Then, as January began, Walker posted to social media a short but to some bafflingly phrased video. Under the message “a few things to think about as we start the New Year”, Walker attacked policy priorities championed by Democrats including Raphael Warnock, Georgia’s first Black senator who will defend his seat in November. “Build Back Better,” he said, referring to Joe Biden’s domestic spending plan, which targets health and social care and the climate crisis. “You know I’m always thinking: if you want to build back better, first you probably want to control the border, because you want to know who you’re building it for and why. Then you probably want to protect your military, because they’re protecting you against people in other countries that don’t like you.” He then shifted to a broader goal, popular among progressives. “Defunding the police? Bad idea. You want to fund the police so that they have better training, better equipment to protect the law of the land, because you don’t want people doing whatever they want to do.” Then he shifted back again. “Build Back Better. You probably want to become energy independent. Otherwise you’re going to depend on other countries for your livelihood. Build Back Better. You probably want something written, like law of the land, stating that all men are to be treated equal. Oh! We have the constitution. So you probably want to put people in charge who’s going to fight for the constitution. “Just thinking. God bless you.” Burgess Owens, a Republican congressman from Utah who once played safety for the New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders, said Walker “represents what the American dream is all about: hard work, strong character, and love for our great country. I am honored to endorse Herschel for Senate and look forward to working with him!” But critics said the video – and a similarly rambling Fox News appearance – was evidence of Walker’s unsuitability for office. To some, such evidence has piled up ever since Walker signaled a shift into politics. Last summer, the Associated Press said “hundreds of pages of public records tied to Walker’s business ventures and his divorce, including many not previously reported, shed new light on a turbulent personal history that could dog his Senate bid”. The documents, the AP said, “detail accusations that Walker repeatedly threatened his ex-wife’s life, exaggerated claims of financial success and alarmed business associates with unpredictable behavior”.
The AP also reported that Walker “has at times been open about his long struggle with mental illness, writing at length in a 2008 book about being diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, once known as multiple personality disorder”. The report also quoted the Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, who said that while Walker “certainly could bring a lot of things to the table … as others have mentioned, there’s also a lot of questions out there”. In the matter of Walker touting a college degree he does not hold, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the false claim was made on a campaign website, “in an online biography advertising Walker’s book, at a campaign rally … and even during his introduction this year at a congressional hearing”. In a statement, Walker said: “I was majoring in criminal justice at UGA when I left to play in the USFL my junior year. After playing with the New Jersey Generals” – a team Trump owned – “I returned to Athens to complete my degree, but life and football got in the way.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/herschel-walker-video-build-back-better-georgia-republican-senate-run-trump
5871;5871;Bannon and allies bid to expand pro-Trump influence in local US politics;2022-01-03T07:00:39Z;['Peter Stone'];['Donald Trump', 'Steve Bannon', 'Michael Flynn', 'US politics', 'Republicans', 'US news', 'World news'];"Key Donald Trump loyalists Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn are at the forefront of a drive to expand Trumpist influence at the local level of US politics while forging ahead with efforts aimed at promoting baseless claims that Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory was fraudulent.
The growing drive by Trump’s hardcore allies has spurred election watchdog groups to voice alarm about the threat to democracy posed by Flynn and Bannon – and other Trump acolytes – as they combine debunked claims about election fraud and calls for further 2020 election audits with planning conservative takeovers of official positions that run US elections. The moves come a year after the attack on the Capitol in Washington when a pro-Trump mob invaded the building in an attempt to stop the certification of Biden’s election victory. Flynn and Bannon, using varying paths, have focused new energy on increasing conservative influence by recruiting more allies for key posts at the local and precinct level with an eye on the 2022 and 2024 elections, and building more political alliances on issues such as vaccine requirements and mask mandates. The strategies Flynn and Bannon are deploying overlap those of other conservative outfits, such as the influential youth group Turning Point USA, to expand the pro-Trump base at the precinct level, and work to elect Trump-backed politicians to key posts such as secretary of state in Georgia, Arizona and other battleground states. Flynn and Bannon have separately relied on a mix of non-profit groups, including one backed by the multimillionaire Patrick Byrne, conservative social media outlets favored by the far right like Telegram, and events that convey evangelical Christian messages with political disinformation. Bannon, for instance, has used his War Room podcast to espouse plans for “taking over the Republican party through the precinct committee strategy” and invited would-be candidates to appear as guests. The podcast, which has tens of millions of downloads, has found a large and receptive conservative following. Flynn, meanwhile, touts the adage that “local action has national impact” and has been a star speaker in several key states at “ReAwaken America” events, which are dubbed “health and freedom” conferences and combine evangelical themes with misinformation about the 2020 election and vaccine skepticism. The conservative crusades by Flynn and Bannon come after Trump pardoned them post-election for lying to the FBI and fraud respectively. Bannon and Flynn also were central actors with other Trump loyalists in scheming about ways to block Congress from certifying Biden’s election, efforts that are under scrutiny as part of a House select committee investigation of the deadly Capitol attack by hundreds of Trump supporters. As they have carved out new roles in the conservative ecosystem, Flynn and Bannon still support Trump’s conspiratorial claims that he lost in 2020 due to massive cheating, a mantra that reinforces their drives to expand local and state electoral influence to give Republicans a better shot at recapturing Congress next year, and the White House in 2024. “We’re seeing a dangerous trend of election deniers lining up to fill election administration positions across the country,” Joanna Lydgate, chief executive of the States United Democracy Center, said in a statement to the Guardian. “And the efforts by Flynn, Bannon and other promoters of the big lie are all part of this playbook to hijack elections in 2022 and 2024 if their preferred candidate doesn’t win.” Likewise, as they have revved up political work on multiple fronts, the two ex-Trump advisers have taken more extremist stances sparking strong criticism. Flynn, a retired army lieutenant general, has been skewered for his authoritarian style advocacy of “one religion” for America, and for speaking at some events with heavy presences by adherents of QAnon conspiracy movement. Flynn’s call for “one religion” came during a talk to a conservative Christian audience in Texas on the ReAwaken America tour in November. “If we are going to have one nation under God, which we must, we have to have one religion,” Flynn said. “One nation under God and one religion under God, right? All of us, working together.” Flynn’s feature role at ReAwaken America meetings in several states such as Michigan and Florida is hardly an accident, according to Byrne, the multimillionaire founder of the America Project that counts Flynn as special adviser and spokesperson. Byrne, who has joined Flynn at some ReAwaken rallies, said in text messages that he and Flynn had a large hand in launching the ReAwaken tour during the spring by bankrolling the events with some “tens of thousands of dollars” from the America Project. Overall, Byrne said that the America Project has raised about $9.5m, of which he donated close to $7m. Byrne and the America Project poured over $3m into a months-long audit of Arizona’s largest county, which Trump was banking on to find major fraud, but which resulted in no significant changes to Biden’s win there or overall in the state, much to Trump’s dismay. Byrne said the project has helped promote audits in other states besides Arizona. Boasting a net worth pegged at about $75m, Byrne is the ex-chief executive of furniture retailer Overstock. Byrne texted that he didn’t vote for Trump, and deems himself a “rule of law” advocate who claims there’s still a “mountain of evidence” to support the widely debunked allegations of fraud. Byrne’s project has had no dearth of Trump links. The project’s president until late last month was Emily Newman, a former Trump aide. Newman, along with Byrne and Flynn, attended a meeting in December 2020 with Trump about ways to block Biden taking office where Flynn touted the option of declaring martial law and deploying the military to rerun the election in key states Trump lost, according to multiple reports. Flynn’s brother, Joe Flynn, has succeeded Newman as the project’s president, Byrne said. On top of his work with the America Project, Flynn’s focus on expanding the Maga base at the local level increased when he became chairman in May of another non-profit, America’s Future, which, in turn, has partnered with Turning Point USA and others to form a larger alliance dubbed County Citizens Defending Freedom USA. The county citizens group has sponsored an array of training programs, protests and candidate meetings with a focus on mask mandates, vaccine requirements and critical race theory, according to Florida lawyer Ron Filipkowski, a former prosecutor who authored a Washington Post article on the wave of local drives by Trump backers. For his part, Bannon’s heavy emphasis on a local “precinct strategy” to help Republican’s electoral fortunes combines conspiratorial and apocalyptic bravado. Bannon told CNN in December that his War Room podcast is an organizing tool to expand Trump’s base. “It’s about winning elections with the right people – Maga people,” Bannon said. “We will have our people in at every level.” “We’re taking over all the elections,” Bannon said in November on his War Room podcast. “We’re going to get to the bottom of [last year’s election] and we’re going to decertify the electors. And you’re going to have a constitutional crisis. But you know what? We’re a big and tough country, and we can handle that, we’ll be able to handle that. We’ll get through that.” Megan Squire, a computer science professor at Elon University, told the Guardian that much of Bannon’s political messaging has relied on alternative social media channels such as Telegram that appeal to conservative and far right allies to spread pro Trump gospel and help broaden the Maga base at the local level. To Squire, Bannon’s rhetoric and large audience look increasingly dangerous. “After being de-platformed from mainstream social media over the past year, Bannon has been promoting ‘alternative’, permissive social media channels such as Telegram and Gettr. There his listeners are able to amplify and intensify Bannon’s messaging into a 24-hour-a-day echo chamber filled with disinformation, scams, and conspiracy theories.” For Lydgate, the chief executive of the States United Democracy Center, the multi-front drives by Bannon, Flynn and other key Trump loyalists pose serious risks for the integrity of future elections. “They want to sow doubt in our democracy and make it easier to undermine the will of American voters.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/steve-bannon-donald-trump-michael-flynn-politics
5872;5872;‘A normal tactic’: Myanmar’s aid workers vow to press on despite Christmas Eve massacre;2022-01-03T06:43:25Z;['Rebecca Root'];['Myanmar', 'South and central Asia'];"“The events of last week are just par for the army’s inhumanity and immorality.” So says Michael Isherwood, chair of the Burma Humanitarian Mission and program director of Backpack Medics, after Myanmar’s junta massacred more than 35 people, including two Save the Children workers, on Christmas Eve. At the time, the attack garnered international headlines, with the children’s charity calling it “absolutely horrifying”, and the UN urging an investigation. Yet Isherwood says attacks like the one on 24 December are not isolated, and describes a military that is “randomly shooting unarmed men, women and children, who steal livestock and burn homes to the ground, who use rape as a weapon”.
The medics he works with recognise the risks and “understand that the Burma army has no morals, character or anything close to civilised decency and behaviour”, he says. Myanmar has seen killings, imprisonment and chaos since the military seized power from the elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi in February last year. Resistance groups have emerged but anyone thought to be opposed to military rule risks being arrested, sentenced to hard labour, or killed. More than 1,300 people have died at the hands of security forces, according to a local monitoring group. Another humanitarian worker, who preferred to not to be named, says: “This incident in Kayah does not mark a new level of violence. It’s not a shift in the pattern of the approach of security forces. It’s not unusual in this context. This is a normal tactic.” She believes the attack was intended to “oppress through fear the civilian population” rather than specifically target aid workers. “Since they’re blatantly, egregiously and frequently targeting the civil population in that way, and since that will often happen in areas where aid activities are needed, then of course that raises the collateral risks to aid actors,” she says. Her organisation would continue its work regardless, she says. A clampdown on domestic media has made details of alleged atrocities hard to confirm, she says, but the link to an international charity in the Christmas Eve attack has offered a grim insight into the risks the people of Myanmar regularly face. According to the Karen Human Rights Group, in the Sagaing region 11 civilians were burned alive on 7 December and 40 people were killed in three different attacks in July. Inger Ashing, the chief executive of Save the Children, put out a statement saying: “The people of Myanmar continue to be targeted with increasing violence and these events demand an immediate response.” ‘It happened quite suddenly’ On Christmas Eve, women, children, and two Save the Children staff members – both new fathers, aged 32 and 28 – were among the victims found on a highway outside Moso village in Kayah state, eastern Myanmar, where pro-democracy rebels have been fighting the military. Save the Children says its staff were travelling back to the office after working nearby when they were caught up in the attack. According to state media, the Myanmar military said it killed a number of “terrorists with weapons” after people in seven vehicles refused to stop. Images of the scene show the blackened remains of multiple bodies inside torched trucks. One international staffer living in Myanmar, who requested anonymity for safety reasons, says: “In this case, I don’t think there was any particular sense that the road was a risky one. It happened quite suddenly. Doing it on Christmas Eve probably was not accidental.” Many in Kayah state identify as Christian. The humanitarian worker says as far as their operations are concerned, they’d be keeping in close contact with staff in Kayah state and tracking their travel. “We’re trying to do what we can to advise people on where is safe to go and where is not but you can’t really know. It’s so widespread.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/a-normal-tactic-myanmars-aid-workers-vow-to-press-on-despite-christmas-eve-massacre

5874;5874;Blue meteors with occasional fireballs – the Quadrantids are at their peak;2022-01-03T06:05:38Z;['Stuart Clark'];['Meteors', 'Astronomy', 'Space', 'Science'];If the clouds cooperate, you can start the year with a meteor shower. The Quadrantid meteor shower reaches its peak activity on or about 3 January each year. This year, the peak has been estimated to occur at about 10pm GMT, although this can vary by a day or so. The shower produces meteors in the sky any time between 28 December and 12 January. It is known for creating blue meteors with occasional fireballs and under ideal conditions can produce more than 100 meteors an hour. Yet, as fleeting as it is unpredictable, the peak is often over in a matter of hours. This year visibility is helped because the moon is new and will have set before the show starts, removing a source of illumination that masks the fainter meteors. To further enhance your chances, find the darkest sky you can and wrap up warm. Watching meteors is a waiting game. The chart shows the view looking north-east from London at midnight GMT on Monday. Do not look directly at the radiant, instead look off to one side. The best view will be in the hours after midnight, before dawn. The Quadrantids are best seen from the northern hemisphere.;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/03/starwatch-blue-with-occasional-fireballs-quadrantids-meteors-peak
5875;5875;Ex-tropical cyclone Seth generates waves up to 9m off Queensland coast;2022-01-03T06:02:45Z;['Mostafa Rachwani'];['Queensland', 'New South Wales', 'Australia news', 'Australia weather'];"Dozens of beaches in Queensland were closed as ex-tropical cyclone Seth approached the Gold and Sunshine coasts, bringing with it huge waves and gale-force winds. Waves up to 9 metres were recorded off Brisbane and Tweed Heads, according to government wave monitoring buoys, while the Bureau of Meteorology issued a hazardous surf warning for the state. The ex-tropical cyclone is generating swells that are affecting the south-east coast of Queensland and the north coast of New South Wales, with residents advised to stay away from beaches. Surf Life Saving Queensland closed all beaches on the Gold Coast, as well as some on the Sunshine Coast and in the Wide Bay Capricorn region, with high tides exacerbating conditions.
The bureau downgraded the cyclone to a subtropical system on Sunday night. Bureau meteorologist Helen Reid said waves along the Sunshine Coast and further south had averaged about 4 metres. That, combined with tides above their highest astronomical point, made conditions dangerous. “It’s quite dangerous, with sea levels higher than you’d expect, plus the waves, leading to a very dangerous situation,” she told Guardian Australia. “It’s almost like a storm surge coming through, with the regular tide high due to the cycle of the moon, and the ex-tropical cyclone, resulting in places that will be inundated.”
Reid said it was “very dangerous” to go swimming but expected conditions to ease over the coming days. “We are expecting conditions to continue over the next 24 hours, but as the system moves slightly west, it might help, it is weakening as it drifts west.” The storm was expected to become a tropical low by the time it moved towards land later on Monday. “It will make life difficult for the coastline, definitely, but it is likely to weaken and not be classed as a tropical cyclone by the time we get to late Monday,” Reid said.
The bureau issued warnings for strong winds of up to 100km/h over coastal areas and higher terrain in south-east Queensland from mid-Monday. The winds combined with the strong swell to create the high waves – with the dangerous surf conditions expected to remain until Tuesday afternoon. A warning for hazardous surf conditions was issued for areas along the coast of NSW on Monday afternoon, with the bureau warning that surf and swell conditions would remain hazardous until Tuesday.
Reid said it was all part of one system moving roughly in line with the NSW-Queensland border. “Those warnings do cover a fair way along the NSW coast, it’s a similar situation with damaging surf and gale wind warnings, with the ex-tropical cyclone roughly in line with the border,” she said. “It means the weather and coastal experiences will be similar.” A woman in her 40s died on Monday after being pulled from rough waters at a beach on NSW’s mid north coast. Emergency services were called to Park Beach at Coffs Harbour about 12.50pm following reports an unconscious woman had been pulled from the water. Witnesses tried to save the woman before police and paramedics arrived and treated her, however she died at the scene. Police are investigating the circumstances and a report will be prepared for the coroner.

5876;5876;Shane review – bottle-blond cricket legend gets personal in engaging doc;2022-01-03T06:00:39Z;['Andrew Pulver'];['Film', 'Documentary films', 'Shane Warne', 'Cricket', 'Cricket Australia', 'Australia sport', 'Australia news', 'Culture', 'Sport', 'World news'];"Here’s the latest in a long line of authorised-version sports documentaries that gives plenty of elbow room for the legend in question to explain themselves, and friends and family to add their admiring two-penn’orth. Shane Warne, Australia’s leading wicket taker in Tests, and second in the all-time list to Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan, makes for an engaging enough subject as he holds forth on his exceptional cricketing career, making honest points about the top-class sportsperson’s ability to block out everything else when necessary, and the consequent damage it does to off-field relationships. Warne burst into the international arena in the 1990s; the odd combination of spin-bowling guile and beach-bum persona making him an instant star. There’s some good stuff on the techniques that he employed that made his bowling so deadly, and he repeats the allegation, in some detail, that Pakistan captain Salim Malik offered him $200,000 to throw a match. (In 2000 Malik was banned for match-fixing, partly on Warne’s evidence.) On the other hand, Warne is a little less forthcoming on his own sporting troubles: being fined for providing information to a bookmaker in 1994 and a 12-month suspension in 2003 for taking a banned diuretic.
Otherwise, this profile skimps a little on the actual cricket – perhaps inevitable when Warne clearly wants to work through the personal stuff – and Warne being Warne, there’s a bit too much pointless comment from celebrity know-nothings such as Ed Sheeran and Chris Martin. On the other hand, Merv Hughes, looking more than ever like a Viking chieftain waiting for his shield-bearer, comes up with some great lines, including comparing Warne to King Kong. Warne no doubt intended the film to shore up his bloody-good-bloke image, and in this he’s got to be satisfied how it’s turned out. • Shane is released on 3 January on digital platforms.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/shane-review-bottle-blond-cricket-legend-gets-personal-in-engaging-doc
5877;5877;The return of whales, seals and dolphins to the British coast is a wonder to witness | Philip Hoare;2022-01-03T06:00:39Z;['Philip Hoare'];['Marine life', 'Environment', 'UK news', 'Rewilding'];"It’s an encouraging start to 2022. In an informal census – or perhaps a sort of watery award ceremony – the Wildlife Trusts’ marine review of 2021 has pointed to humpback whales off the north-east coast of Scotland and England, increasing numbers of seal pups being born, and seahorses in protected beds of eel grass off the Dorset coast. It seems the work of the trusts and other marine conservation bodies is having a good effect. Blue whales appearing in the Irish Sea may be physical beneficiaries of the general agreement of the International Whaling Commission in 1982, effected three years later, to halt the cull of the species. It is as if the whales themselves remember, encouraged to return without fear of someone sticking a harpoon in them. But in many ways these optimistic signs are also the markers of what we have lost. In the 19th century the waterways of the Solent were so full of salmon that local apprentices, according to one author writing in 1850, “stipulated in their indentures that it should not be served up to them oftener than three times a-week”. The same author reported shoals of porpoises in Southampton Water, “rolling and springing on the surface in their renewed gambols”. While in the 18th century, Oliver Goldsmith reported on an English Channel filled with whales, dolphins, cod fish, tuna and even great white sharks chasing columns of herrings. “The whole water seems alive,” Goldsmith wrote in one of the first popular science books, Animated Nature, in 1776, “and is seen so black with them that the number seems inexhaustible.” Humans, too, were once more watery. In the north of England and Scotland, fisherwomen were known as herring quines, so covered were they in silvery scales they seemed to be becoming fish themselves. Charles Richard Weld of the Royal Society declared in 1859, riffing on Darwin: “If a man may become a monkey, or has been a whale, why should not a Caithness damsel become a herring?” To these writers, the idea that one day there might not be plenty more fish in the sea would have been unthinkable. The depredations of the natural world that began to accelerate in the 19th century would remove much of that marine biomass from around our shores, with disastrous effects. The physical absence of the great whales such as blue, fin, humpback and sperm whales may have actually accelerated the climate crisis – because it deprived the oceanic food chain of their fertilising faeces, and their rotting carcasses which, on the sea bed, helped sequester carbon from the ecosphere and sustain species, from polar bears and seals to bone-eating osedax worms. The life cycles of smaller organisms depended entirely on carcasses. We look to science to point out what needs to be done, but often art inspires as much as academic reports. In 2012, Heather Ackroyd and Dan Harvey performed a kind of reincarnation on the skeleton of a minke whale stranded at Skegness by growing diamond-like chemical crystals on its bones. A year later, the artists Ellen Gallagher and Edgar Cleijne used the bone-eating worm to conjure up a similarly alchemical transformation in their film, Osedax: a dead whale slowly sways to the bottom to become, in the words of Shakespeare’s Ariel in The Tempest, “something rich and strange”. With its shapeshifting sense of gender (slipper snails form stacks upon each other, changing sex from male at the bottom to female at the top) and of time (“shadow” parts of the ocean may be 1,000 years old), the sea defies all our assumptions. It is a decidedly queer place; just ask any dolphin. Nor does it recognise national boundaries, of course.
The sea is where our laws and jurisdictions run out. That inevitably raises contrary questions of responsibility and freedom. Indeed, it is hard to divorce the threats to our native marine life from “alien species” without considering the human refugees arriving on those same shores. Or to note that the climate crisis is a driver for both. It is easy to ignore the sea, or to think of it as a kind of highway with a fish shop attached. Some may consider it bizarre that commentators such as George Monbiot call for a rewilding of our seas as well as of the land. Others may worry there’s no chance of that while English and French politicians squabble over who has the “right” to take fish from the sea. But humpbacks off Whitby? Dancing sea slugs off Cumbria? White-beaked dolphins off Essex? These may be anomalies or signs of disruption, but merely bearing witness to such wonders has the power to restore our faith. As I swim in the chilly winter sea, the sleek black head of a grey seal pops up beside me, and in the louring grey sky a skein of brent geese, charcoal-coloured visitors from Siberia, steer into view. It’s not quite Goldsmith’s vision of Eden, but I’m still hoping for miracles in 2022. Happy new year to the sea, all its species, and to all of you.

Alagiah, 66, was first diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in April 2014, which spread to his lungs, liver and lymph nodes. He announced in October he was taking a break from his presenting duties as he dealt with “a further spread of cancer”. In a conversation with Craig Oliver, a former Downing Street director of communications, Alagiah discussed living with the disease. “I don’t think I’m going to be able to get rid of this thing. I’ve got the cancer still. It’s growing very slowly,” he said in an interview for Oliver’s podcast, Desperately Seeking Wisdom.
“My doctor’s very good at every now and again hitting me with a big red bus full of drugs, because the whole point about cancer is it bloody finds a way through and it gets you in the end. “Probably … it will get me in the end. I’m hoping it’s a long time from now, but I’m very lucky.” The presenter said he would never wish he had cancer, but he would not give back the years he had lived with it because he had learned so much. He added his cancer diagnosis had helped him to figure out what was important in his life. “I had to stop and say, ‘Hang on a minute. If the full stop came now, would my life have been a failure?’ “And actually, when I look back and I looked at my journey … the family I had, the opportunities my family had, the great good fortune to bump into [Frances Robathan], who’s now been my wife and lover for all these years, the kids that we brought up … it didn’t feel like a failure.” Alagiah was born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and attended primary school in Ghana before attending secondary school in Portsmouth and studying at Durham university. He joined the BBC in 1989 and, before becoming a presenter, worked as a foreign correspondent, reporting on events including the Rwandan genocide, and interviewing Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu in his role as a specialist on Africa and the developing world. Asked what piece of wisdom he would give, he said: “I think it would be to constantly ask the question, ‘What is it we can do together?’ “I spent a lot of my time in Africa, and in South Africa they have a word: ubuntu. It’s the idea that I’m only human if I recognise the humanity in you. There’s this collective notion of life which I think we have lost.” The podcast episode is released on 3 January.";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/03/cancer-will-probably-get-me-in-the-end-says-george-alagiah
5879;5879;US could be under rightwing dictator by 2030, Canadian professor warns;2022-01-03T06:00:39Z;['Richard Luscombe'];['US politics', 'Donald Trump', 'US news', 'Republicans', 'US elections 2024', 'US foreign policy', 'The far right', 'Canada', 'Americas', 'World news'];"The US could be under a rightwing dictatorship by 2030, a Canadian political science professor has warned, urging his country to protect itself against the “collapse of American democracy”.
“We mustn’t dismiss these possibilities just because they seem ludicrous or too horrible to imagine,” Thomas Homer-Dixon, founding director of the Cascade Institute at Royal Roads University in British Columbia, wrote in the Globe and Mail. “In 2014, the suggestion that Donald Trump would become president would also have struck nearly everyone as absurd. But today we live in a world where the absurd regularly becomes real and the horrible commonplace.” Homer-Dixon’s message was blunt: “By 2025, American democracy could collapse, causing extreme domestic political instability, including widespread civil violence. By 2030, if not sooner, the country could be governed by a rightwing dictatorship.” The author cited eventualities centered on a Trump return to the White House in 2024, possibly including Republican-held state legislatures refusing to accept a Democratic win. Trump, he warned, “will have only two objectives, vindication and vengeance” of the lie that his 2020 defeat by Joe Biden was the result of electoral fraud. A “scholar of violent conflict” for more than four decades, Homer-Dixon said Canada must take heed of the “unfolding crisis”. “A terrible storm is coming from the south, and Canada is woefully unprepared. Over the past year we’ve turned our attention inward, distracted by the challenges of Covid-19, reconciliation and the accelerating effects of climate change. “But now we must focus on the urgent problem of what to do about the likely unraveling of democracy in the United States. We need to start by fully recognising the magnitude of the danger. If Mr Trump is re-elected, even under the more optimistic scenarios the economic and political risks to our country will be innumerable.” Homer-Dixon said he even saw a scenario in which a new Trump administration, having effectively nullified internal opposition, deliberately damaged its northern neighbor. “Under the less-optimistic scenarios, the risks to our country in their cumulative effect could easily be existential, far greater than any in our federation’s history. What happens, for instance, if high-profile political refugees fleeing persecution arrive in our country and the US regime demands them back. Do we comply?”
Trump, he said, “and a host of acolytes and wannabes such as Fox [News]’s Tucker Carlson and Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene”, had transformed the Republican party “into a near-fascist personality cult that’s a perfect instrument for wrecking democracy”. Worse, he said, Trump “may be just a warm-up act”. “Returning to office, he’ll be the wrecking ball that demolishes democracy but the process will produce a political and social shambles,” Homer-Dixon said. “Still, through targeted harassment and dismissal, he’ll be able to thin the ranks of his movement’s opponents within the state, the bureaucrats, officials and technocrats who oversee the non-partisan functioning of core institutions and abide by the rule of law. “Then the stage will be set for a more managerially competent ruler, after Mr Trump, to bring order to the chaos he’s created.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/us-rightwing-dictatorship-2030-trump-canada
5880;5880;Lockdown hobbies led to thousands of injuries in England, NHS data suggests;2022-01-03T06:00:38Z;['Jessica Murray'];['Health', 'UK news', 'NHS', 'Coronavirus', 'Society', 'Hospitals'];Popular lockdown pursuits such as cooking, DIY and buying pets led to thousands of people needing hospital care for injuries, figures suggest. Analysis of hospital admissions in England by the PA Media news agency showed that thousands were treated for injuries sustained as a result of activities that surged in popularity as people were confined to their homes. The data from NHS Digital for 2020-21 showed that more than 5,600 people attended hospital after coming into contact with a powered hand-tool, and more than 2,700 were admitted after an accident with a non-powered hand-tool such as a hammer or a saw. Figures also showed that 349 people were admitted after injuring themselves with lawnmowers. More than 5,300 people were admitted after falling from playground equipment, with the average age of patients being nine and a half years. However, some parents and grandparents were involved as well, with dozens of people over the age of 30 admitted after falling from playground equipment, including eight people over the age of 90. Data showed that 962 people were treated in hospital for injuries sustained while climbing trees. Lockdowns also triggered a “pet baby boom” with data from the Pet Food Manufacturers’ Association in March showing that 3.2m households in the UK had acquired a pet since the start of the pandemic. These new animals did not always bring joy, however, as 7,386 people were admitted to English hospitals after being bitten or struck by a dog, along with 47 people suffering a rat bite, and 60 people who had come into contact with a venomous spider. Four people were admitted after coming into contact with a scorpion. Many people turned their hand to improving their cooking skills, and admissions data showed that 2,243 needed to be admitted after coming into contact with hot drinks, food, fats and cooking oils. Although many were grateful for the sunny weather in the first lockdown, 153 people were admitted to hospital with sunburn. The figures only include people who were admitted to hospital, and many more injuries would have been dealt with by A&E doctors and GPs. The figures for most accidents and injuries were lower than in previous years as people generally spent more time indoors. A spokesperson for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said: “The publication of hospital admission figures always serves to remind us of the breadth of accident types that can result in an injury so severe that admission to hospital is required. In among the stranger entries in the database are some worrying trends that serve to highlight the accident challenges that we face. Accidents are preventable.”;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/03/lockdown-hobbies-led-to-thousands-of-injuries-in-england-nhs-data-suggests
5881;5881;UK’s late payment ‘crisis’ risks future of 440,000 small firms;2022-01-03T06:00:38Z;['Miles Brignall'];['Small business', 'Bankruptcy and IVAs', 'UK news', 'Business'];"More than 440,000 small firms could be forced out of business by the late payment “crisis”, according to the Federation of Small Businesses, which has called for urgent government intervention to improve the way firms are paid. Almost a third of small businesses (30%) surveyed told the FSB that they had seen the late payment of invoices increase over the last three months, with at least 8% warning that the problem has become so bad that it was threatening the viability of their business. For years the problem of late payments – often by big FTSE firms – has dogged the small business sector. Firms are often forced to pay their suppliers, wages and other bills on time, but face long waits to be paid themselves. The FSB said more than 400,000 small firms have shut down since the start of the pandemic for various reasons, and that the future of a similar number is now threatened by this problem alone.
“Late payment was destroying thousands of small businesses even before the pandemic hit – the pandemic has made matters worse,” said the FSB national chair, Mike Cherry. “In the past, the government has rightly identified greater board accountability as key to spurring change in this area, but delivery has been slow.” Cherry said small firms, which employ more than 13 million workers in the UK, are facing battles on almost every front, including new customs checks on imports from the EU and a looming energy cost crisis. “Today, it’s a fresh wave of admin for importers and exporters – in three months’ time it will be a hike to the jobs tax, that is national insurance contributions, a rise in dividend taxation, business rates bills and an increase in the national living wage. On top of that, operating costs are surging – many will soon be trying to strike energy deals without the clout of big corporates or the protections afforded to consumers.” The FSB has said every big business and government organisation should be abiding by the prompt payment code arguing that 30-day payment terms should be “the norm for those who are committed to environmental, social and governance best practice”. It wants every big UK corporation to have a non-executive director on its board with direct responsibility for payment culture.
The other findings of the FSB survey of more than 1,200 members will concern ministers. More small firms now expect their performance to worsen over the coming three months than expect an improvement. Pessimism is especially pronounced in the retail, accommodation and food industries, as many UK consumers adopted self-imposed lockdowns in the face of Omicron. Pictures of deserted high streets in the run-up to Christmas, fears over spiralling energy costs and concerns that staff will not be able return to work on Tuesday have not helped matters. Spiralling energy bills have already forced some firms to close. Businesses are not protected by the price cap imposed by the regulator Ofgem. Companies importing goods from the EU also now face new, onerous paperwork. Regulations require businesses (in most cases those receiving goods in the UK, but in some those sending them to the UK) to notify the customs authorities of precisely what is being sent to Great Britain from the EU, and from where. The rules were in effect waived throughout 2021 but now apply for the first time. A government spokesperson said: “The government is making significant reforms to help small businesses get paid on time, including halving the payment period in the prompt payment code and consulting on fines and other new powers for the Small Business Commissioner.” “There is plenty of support available to ensure small businesses are well positioned to comply with UK border processes, including one-to-one advice through the Export Support Service.”";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/03/uks-late-payment-crisis-risks-future-of-440000-small-firms
5882;5882;Western Isles looks to end stigma of being Scotland’s only all-male council;2022-01-03T06:00:38Z;['Severin Carrell'];['Scotland', 'Inequality', 'Gender', 'Local government', 'Women', 'UK news', 'Politics'];"An appeal has been issued for women to stand as councillors in the Western Isles in 2022 in an effort to end the Hebridean islands’ unwelcome status as the only Scottish authority with an all-male council. Islanders and equality campaigners were stunned in 2017 when none of the seven women who stood were elected for the Western Isles. Only one, an incumbent, came close to winning a seat in the 31-member authority. Alarmed officials on Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, Gaelic for the Western Isles council, are staging an online workshop in January to persuade more women to stand in May’s elections, in concert with Elect Her, a group specialising in combating gender inequalities in government. Nearly 20 women have signed up for the workshop, and for many involved it has raised deeper questions for the authority, its leadership and the community as a whole. Western Isles has been the only all-male council in Scotland, and possibly the UK, for nearly five years. “It’s always concerning when a large sector of the population is unrepresented,” said Malcolm Burr, the council’s chief executive. “When our all-male comhairle was elected in 2017, we thought: this isn’t wholly representative of the community, what should we do about it?” Paradoxically, voting rates for Western Isles council elections are among the highest in Scotland. Women are prominent and influential leaders in community and business life, yet only a handful ever win seats. The peak was five in 2007. Few stand for election. One barrier is the ban on council employees being elected to the same authority, to prevent conflicts of interest. On the mainland, councillors can work for a neighbouring authority; in the Outer Hebrides, that is impractical. Western Isles council is the largest employer, with 2,185 staff for a population of 26,500; in many roles, most employees are women. Burr said the rules now allowed a council employee to stand for election. But they would have to quit their council job if they won, exchanging the security of a career, fixed hours and a public-sector salary for the £18,604 a councillor earned, with no guarantee of re-election.
Zena Stewart, a former councillor who topped her ward’s election in 2012, only stood after retiring from the Nicolson Institute, the secondary school for Lewis, partly for that reason. “If you’re being paid as a councillor, there’s more asked of you,” she said. “I had to attend every meeting unless there was an obvious reason why I couldn’t.” Katie Laing, a part-time teacher, journalist and vice-convener of Stornoway community council, said that was a significant obstacle, in particular for women with children.
In addition, a large majority of Western Isles councillors traditionally stand as independents, limiting the scope for positively discriminating in favour of female candidates – a strategy routinely used by political parties in mainland elections. Campaigners say that amplifies the importance of already powerful institutions such as the church – candidates known to local congregations have a ready-made electorate, and men dominate many Hebridean churches. Stewart said councillors connected to churches often won because they had earned respect; the same could apply to golf club leaders. Agnes Rennie, a community leader who also won election in later life, said councillors were expected to be present at key community events, involving long distances and late evenings away from home. For women with families, that burden could be onerous. “You are measured against whether you’re there or not,” she said.
For some women, there was the perception council life was unjustifiably combative and toxic, said Laing, particularly in a small island community where conformity could be harshly policed. Rennie said much greater emphasis on flexible meeting times, video conferencing and policies allowing absences for those with family responsibilities was needed. So, too, were visible role models so “women can imagine themselves in that role. It’s a big step for many people,” she said. A long tradition of community leadership and voluntary work meant women “have tremendous skills and experience that would bring so much to the role; I have no doubt women bring a different perspective”, she said.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/western-isles-scotland-all-male-council-workshop-women
5883;5883;World’s oldest person celebrates 119th birthday in Japan nursing home;2022-01-03T05:51:11Z;['Justin McCurry'];['Japan', 'Ageing'];"The world’s oldest person has celebrated her 119th birthday in Japan, saying she is determined to extend the record by another year. Kane Tanaka, who has a weakness for fizzy drinks and chocolate, marked the milestone on Sunday with staff at the nursing home where she lives in Fukuoka prefecture, south-west Japan, according to media reports. The Guinness Book of Records recognised Tanaka’s status in March 2019, when she was 116; she went on to achieve an all-time Japanese age record when she reached 117 years and 261 days in September 2020. Born in 1903 – the year the Wright brothers made their first powered flight and the first Tour de France was held – Tanaka has lived through five Japanese imperial reigns and has set her sights on reaching her 120th birthday, the Kyodo news agency quoted family members as saying. Tanaka, who was born six months before George Orwell, is one of a large and growing number of Japanese centenarians. In an estimate released in September ahead of the annual Respect for the Aged Day, the health ministry said a record 86,510 people were aged 100 or older, an increase of 6,060 from the previous year. Women make up the vast majority of centenarians, with men accounting for just over 10,000, the ministry said. When the annual survey was first conducted in 1963, Japan had just 153 centenarians, but the number had soared to over 10,000 by 1998. Life expectancy in Japan, one of the fastest-ageing societies on earth, is also at a record high, at 87.74 for women and 81.64 for men. The number of young people is shrinking, however, amid failed attempts to raise the country’s low birth rate. Government figures showed that 1.2 million people saw in the New Year as new adults – those who had turned 20 – a drop of 40,000 from last year and the lowest number since records were first kept in 1968. Twenty-year-olds have accounted for less than 1% of the country’s population for the past 12 years, public broadcaster NHK said. When Tanaka became Japan’s oldest person on record she celebrated with a bottle of Coke – her favourite drink – and made a peace sign for photographers. While visiting restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic means she has had limited contact with family members, she reportedly uses gestures to communicate with nursing home staff and is keen on puzzles and board games. The seventh of nine siblings, Tanaka married when she was 19 and helped run the family’s noodle shop after her husband and eldest son went to fight in the second Sino-Japanese war, which began in 1937. Her 62-year-old grandson, Eiji, said he wanted to congratulate Tanaka in person as soon as possible. “I hope she remains healthy and has fun everyday as she grows older,” Kyodo quoted him as saying.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/worlds-oldest-person-celebrates-119th-birthday-in-japan-nursing-home
5884;5884;‘People will die’: doctors warn Covid surge is filling up NSW hospitals;2022-01-03T05:38:50Z;['Peter Hannam'];['New South Wales', 'Australia news', 'Sydney', 'Health', 'Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant'];"Hospitals in NSW are much closer to capacity due to surging Covid cases than is being admitted by officials, warn doctors and nurses, with one saying the system has “never been this bad”. One senior specialist said “even the most routine urgent treatment” was already being cancelled to divert resources to Covid. “People will die,” he said. The state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, repeated on Monday that the health system remained “very well placed” to cope with rising hospitalisation rates. The number of patients in intensive care units (ICU) rose 14% in the previous 24 hours with more than 20,000 new Covid cases again reported in NSW.
Privately, though, doctors and nurses who are not authorised to speak publicly say the health system is close to capacity. “No way will the health system cope,” said the senior specialist. “It’s never been this bad.” The senior doctor said the focus on staff shortages overlooked the issue that all the state’s major hospitals were rapidly approaching bed capacity. At the current rate “every single bed will only be for Covid patients … it doesn’t matter how many staff they call back”. A nurse at a major hospital, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that while her centre still had spare beds, there were “huge gaps in staffing”. Lung and heart transplant patients were among those who were not getting the care they would have just two years ago, the nurse with almost a decade’s experience said. “People are turning up really unwell,” she said. “They are staying 40, 50, 60 hours” in emergency wards while they wait for capacity to be made available.
“We don’t have enough staff to spread around,” the nurse said. “It’s just been brushed under the floor … we’re shocked.” At Liverpool hospital, one of Sydney’s major medical centres in the city’s south-west, five general wards and two ICU wards had already been set aside for Covid patients. The main emergency department waiting room on Monday was full with would-be patients who were spilling out into the street, with one young woman vomiting into a plastic bag as she waited to be seen. Staff were not permitted to speak to the media. Guardian Australia was told no hospital official would be commenting, and was politely asked to leave the hospital premises.
Among those waiting in the 30C heat, though, was a mother and her two daughters from Padstow Heights, about 17km away from Liverpool. One daughter had Covid symptoms and the trio had been waiting for more than an hour outside the emergency department to see a doctor. They had already tried unsuccessfully to get tested at three other public sites. Alex Kanazir had waited four hours by early afternoon to have his 70-year-old mother treated for stomach pains. A month earlier, when his mum had broken her arm, they had only waited an hour before she was admitted, and spent five days in a ward. One concern for those facing lengthy delays was the added risk of contracting Covid, even if that was not the prompt for the visit. “It’s catch-22,” Kanazir said, adding visitors to the emergency department were warned there had already been at least one Covid case that morning. Emergency patients at the hospital would ideally wait no more than four hours before being moved to appropriate wards. The current wait can be a day or more, one staffer said. The nurse from another major hospital said general staff fatigue was on the rise and it was inevitable many experienced health workers would leave the industry. “I think we’re going to see mass resignations,” she said. “This isn’t the way the health system should work.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/people-will-die-doctors-warn-covid-surge-is-filling-up-nsw-hospitals
5885;5885;Hong Kong’s Citizen News to close citing fears for staff safety;2022-01-03T05:36:41Z;['Helen Davidson'];['Hong Kong', 'Press freedom', 'Journalist safety', 'Asia Pacific', 'Media', 'Newspapers & magazines', 'World news', 'China', 'Protest'];"The Hong Kong independent news outlet Citizen News has said it will cease operations from Tuesday in the face of what it described as a deteriorating media environment in the Chinese-ruled city and to ensure the safety of its staff. “Regrettably, the rapid changes in society and worsening environment for media make us unable to achieve our goal fearlessly. Amid this crisis, we have to first make sure everyone on the boat is safe,” Citizen News, which was established in 2017, said in a statement.
At a press conference on Monday, Citizen News chief editor Daisy Li said the environment had changed, and she didn’t know what “safe” news was any more. “If I am no longer confident enough to guide and lead my reporters, I must be responsible,” she said. The decision to close Citizen News was triggered by the early morning police raid of Hong Kong’s Stand News last week, Chris Yeung, chief writer at Citizen News and former president of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, told reporters on Monday. “We could not rule out that … we might be exposed to some risks,” Yeung said. “Reporting fearlessly means we aren’t afraid of offending the political elite, we criticise the authorities when their policies aren’t right, we don’t shy from covering corporations due to business pressure,” he said, according to local media. “But it doesn’t mean we should have to sacrifice our freedom as a price.” Last week hundreds of police raided the Stand News newsroom, and arrested seven current and former employees, including popstar activist Denise Ho. Two former senior editors of the outlet were charged with conspiring to publish seditious materials and denied bail. The UN and media watchdogs CPJ and RSF condemned the crackdown as an attack on press freedom. “The government is abusing a draconian colonial law that has not been used for more than FIVE decades to prosecute journalists,” said exiled activist and former politician, Nathan Law. It followed last year’s enforced closure of Apple Daily and the arrest of several journalists and executives last year, and a government-led overhaul of the operations of public broadcaster RTHK. Pro-democracy activists and rights groups say freedoms promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, including freedom of the press, have been increasingly eroded since Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020. Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly rejected accusations they are eroding rights and freedoms, and the city’s government denies targeting the media. In an interview with China News Agency on Monday, security secretary Chris Tang lauded his bureau’s arrests of “anti-China agitators”, singling out the “cessation” of Apple Daily as the most impressive, the Standard reported. In its description on Facebook, Citizen News says it has no party affiliation and aims to promote Hong Kong’s core values, such as those of freedom, openness, diversity and inclusion. In a farewell message of thanks to its readers, the outlet said it had launched hoping “to serve the public and greater public good”. “We may not be the fastest or the most productive outlets in town but our team, with veterans and young journalists, stand united to publish truthful news reporting with depth,” it said. “We all love this place deeply. Regrettably, what was ahead of us is not just pouring rains or blowing winds, but hurricanes and tsunamis.” The Hong Kong Journalists Association said it was deeply saddened by the closures of the two outlets, and that the impact the crackdown on press would have on Hong Kong’s reputation was hard to describe. • This article was amended on 3 January 2022 to clarify details about the raid on the Stand News newsroom.

5886;5886;Country diary: On this hazy morning, the distant hills are barely visible;2022-01-03T05:30:37Z;['John Gilbey'];['Rural affairs', 'Environment', 'UK news', 'Trees and forests', 'Birds'];"Ahead of me at the far end of the path, just where it drops into the next valley, the wind has corralled a drift of dry leaves between the hedgerows. It fills the space behind the gate almost ankle deep, so that opening it sweeps a quadrant clear to mark my passage. The air is still and cold, the grass fringed with lines of frost, distant sounds seem unusually close at hand. Ivy weaves across the bank below the beech wood, bright green against the dead brash of the woodland floor, with early light reflecting from the glossy cuticles of the leaves.
I pause and look eastwards along the valley of the Afon Rheidol. A few sheep look up from the pasture before realising I’m not carrying anything remotely edible – certainly not a rattling bag of grass nuts – and return to their stolid routine. A thin mist hangs between the trees that mark the course of the river, fading into the veil of haze which softens the distant hills. The sun has finally climbed above the horizon, but is still low in the sky – and a single red kite beats across the hillside in its search for breakfast. At the end of each pass the kite makes a sharp right-hand turn, the sun lighting up the russet of its underside as it wheels around.
After the recent storms I’m relieved to see an old friend has survived. An ancient tree, split by time and weather into multiple trunks, and with an almost fractal crown, stands resolutely at the end of the hedgerow. Sheltered from the north and west by the steep hillside, only a scattering of twigs have fallen since I was last here, so the outline of the tree against the light retains its barely balanced complexity. I wander on down the lane under the bare chestnut trees, looking across at the field where gorse has begun to invade the lightly grazed pasture. Even at the turning of the year the gorse is, as usual, in flower – a scattering of yellow gently lit by the milky sunshine. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/03/country-diary-on-this-hazy-morning-the-distant-hills-are-barely-visible
5887;5887;Rebuilding bridges: Former president’s mission to defeat Bolsonaro in Brazil;2022-01-03T05:00:37Z;['Tom Phillips'];['Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva', 'Jair Bolsonaro', 'Brazil', 'Americas', 'World news'];"Former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is set to make a globe-trotting start to 2022 as he ramps up his campaign to defeat Brazil’s far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, with a series of international trips to the US, China, Russia and Mexico. Twenty years after being elected Brazil’s first working-class president, in 2002, the veteran leftwinger is gearing up for an electrifying bid to reclaim power in next October’s presidential election. The Guardian understands that Lula, 76, is likely to formally announce his candidacy in March, shortly after his Workers’ party (PT) celebrates the 42nd anniversary of its foundation on 10 February 1980. Simultaneously, the politician, who governed from 2003 to 2010 during the early years of a commodity-fuelled boom, will make a series of overseas trips that allies say are designed to repair the South American country’s international reputation and denounce Bolsonaro’s threat to Brazil’s young democracy. “President Lula needs to travel the world to rebuild the bridges that were destroyed by Bolsonaro and to denounce the great risk Bolsonaro continues to pose to Brazilian democracy,” said Alexandre Padilha, a former Lula minister and PT congressman. Lula’s first trip is expected to be to Mexico in January, where he is likely to be received by its leftwing president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. During a recent visit to Argentina, Lula was welcomed by its leftwing leaders, Alberto Fernández and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and talked up the possibility of a progressive revival across Latin America. Trips to the US, China and Russia are also planned for the first quarter of 2022 while visits to Italy, Portugal and the UK are also on the cards. In November, Lula made a four-nation tour of Europe, during which he met the now chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, and was invited to the Élysée Palace by Emmanuel Macron.
Padilha said it was essential that Lula alerted the world over fears Bolsonaro might refuse to recognise the election result just as his political idol, Donald Trump, did in the US. “This isn’t just an ordinary electoral battle. We are going to face a historic movement in which a neofascist movement in Brazil led by Bolsonaro must be defeated.” With less than a year until the election, Lula appears poised to beat Bolsonaro, whose ratings have plunged amid soaring inflation and a devastating Covid crisis that has killed more than 615,000 people and hammered the economy. One recent poll gave Lula a 27-point advantage over Bolsonaro and suggested he was close to a first-round victory. Cláudio Couto, a political scientist from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, said much could change between now and the 2 October vote. “But everything suggests that at the very least Lula has a place in the second round. The question is, who will join him?” Most observers still believe the answer is Bolsonaro, who retains a hardcore support base of about 20% of voters and hopes Auxílio Brasil, a new social welfare programme, will win him back support among poor people. But Bolsonaro’s chances have been dented by a rightwing challenge from his former justice minister Sergio Moro, who resigned from the cabinet in April 2020 accusing the president of trying to meddle in the federal police. Moro, a former judge who helped force Lula from the 2018 presidential campaign before joining Bolsonaro’s government, recently announced his return to politics and appears third in polls. Couto said a “fratricidal war” between Moro and Bolsonaro could boost Lula’s campaign by splitting the Brazilian right. “I suspect Bolsonaro is probably very irritated, particularly with Moro. Bolsonaro and his sons have gone on the attack against him and this shows that they’ve grasped the danger of Moro stealing his place [in the second round].” Couto said Lula’s globetrotting was partly about re-engaging with foreign governments before what would be his third term as president.
Mostly, however, the journeys were aimed at a domestic audience with Lula trying to contrast his statesmanlike travels with the international isolation of Bolsonaro, who has alienated key international partners including Joe Biden’s US, Xi Jinping’s China and EU leaders such as France’s Macron. Couto said Bolsonaro was considered a global “espalha rodinha” (pain in the neck) – “the kind of guy who makes everyone flee when he joins conversation”. “This is a trump card for Lula,” Couto said, adding that even Brazil’s economic elites, who helped elect Bolsonaro, now realised Lula commanded international respect, while Bolsonaro was widely rejected for his handling of coronavirus and the environment. Padilha said the world saw Lula as “a popular and experienced politician who favours dialogue … and was interested in protecting the environment and reducing poverty and inequality. Bolsonaro’s image is of destruction. Of a far-right leader who is anti-environment [and] anti-vaccine and condemned Brazil to the greatest human tragedy in our history.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-brazilian-former-president-mission-to-defeat-bolsonaro
5888;5888;La Niña weather pattern keeps temperatures in Australia down but 2021 still hotter than average;2022-01-03T04:50:50Z;['Graham Readfearn'];['Australia weather', 'Australia news', 'Climate crisis', 'La Niña'];"Australia’s 2021 was its coolest year since 2012, but still half a degree hotter than average according to data from the Bureau of Meteorology. A dominant La Niña weather pattern kept temperatures lower than in recent years and total rainfall across the country was only slightly higher than average. Across the bureau’s temperature records going back to 1910, 2021 was the 17th hottest, with the national temperature 0.56C warmer than the average between 1961 and 1990. Australia has not had a year where the temperature was below the long-term average since 2000. The hottest year on record is 2019, which was 1.51C above average.
The data shows 2021 was the 28th wettest year nationwide since 1900 with a total of 507mm – only slightly above the annual average of 466mm. The wettest year on record remains 1974, when the bureau’s records show 760mm fell. Neil Plummer, a climatologist and consultant at Monash University’s climate change communication research hub, said 2021 had been a “signature La Niña” year. “We get a lot of stronger south-easterly winds flowing in to tropical areas and we get more convection and more high clouds and more rainfall in northern and eastern Australia. “That’s what we’ve seen since the back end of 2020. This is a signature La Niña over Australia.” New South Wales and the ACT had the coolest year since 1996, with the overall temperature only 0.15C above average. NSW recorded its wettest November since at least 1900, and 2021 was its sixth wettest year on record.
In Victoria, the average temperature was the lowest since 2004, but still 0.26C above average. Rainfall was 36mm above the state’s annual average of 663mm. Queensland’s statewide temperature was 1C above average, making it the coolest year since 2012. Rainfall was also slightly above average. Western Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and South Australia were all slightly warmer than average. The only state and territory to record below average rainfall was South Australia, which dipped below its average by just 4mm. The bureau declared the La Niña in November.
Plummer, a former head of climate services at the bureau, said 2021 was one of the warmest La Niña years on record and continued the long-term heating being driven by climate change. “There’s a very clear warming trend in Australia,” he said. “There is no doubt that the climate risks are continuing to build. “Even though this 0.56C [above average] in 2021 is less than we’ve seen for a decade, that’s still giving us an almost straight line warming trend since 1950. “It is remarkable that we no longer see strong negative temperature anomalies. I wouldn’t say they’ve disappeared, but it’s going to be increasingly hard to get them.” The bureau will release more information about the climate of 2021 later this week. Last month the bureau’s climate outlook for the next three months said there was an increased chance of “unusually high minimum temperatures” for January to March over much of the country. Rainfall was likely to be above average for eastern Australia, with northern Queensland and coastal NSW in particular having a very wet January to March.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/la-nina-weather-pattern-keeps-temperatures-in-australia-down-but-2021-still-hotter-than-average
5889;5889;Tens of thousands of Australians are in isolation ;2022-01-03T04:50:45Z;['Royce Kurmelovs'];['Australia news', 'New South Wales', 'Coronavirus', 'Disability', 'Omicron variant'];"Something about the sticky floors of the dingy nightclub Gemma Moore was at on the New South Wales central coast gave her the sense she was about to get sick. “It was a good night, but I just really didn’t feel comfortable being out,” Moore said. “There weren’t any QR codes and the staff weren’t wearing masks. And I remember thinking: someone in here has Covid.” A few days later, the 28-year-old care worker’s hunch proved correct when she, her boyfriend and her housemate all showed symptoms and tested positive to Covid.
“It took me ages to believe it was Covid,” Moore said. “I couldn’t wrap my head around it. I had had a negative rapid antigen test and it all had felt so far away. “I also really didn’t want to have it, because that meant the people I saw in the last two days, my clients, were exposed and I was really worried about them.” From the moment they received their PCR results, the three went into isolation, joining thousands of others across the country despite efforts by political leaders to open up the country ahead of Christmas. “We can’t leave the house,” Moore says. “It feels like this invisible barrier – we’ve all been saying it. We can go to the end of the driveway and watch people from a distance as they walk or drive past, but we can’t go any further. “It’s weird to feel normal, but also know that we’re infectious. It’s weird to think that just by me going out in the community I could share the love.” Moore, however, says they are among the lucky ones. With a stable housing situation, an ocean view and their other housemates visiting their families for the holidays, they have avoided a situation where they would have had to isolate from each other as well as the world. Their mornings are spent apart, but they share meals and wait out the time in the afternoons. Anna Mazzone had a different experience when she travelled to Adelaide from Berlin via Melbourne, and ended up spending almost three weeks in isolation over Christmas. It was the 35-year-old’s first trip home in two years to visit her parents and she had initially quarantined with her brother in a small unit in Adelaide. Over the course of the first week, the siblings couldn’t avoid each other in the “one big space”. Then, on the final day, Mazzone tested positive.
“Unfortunately, I must have caught it travelling. When I landed in Melbourne, I got a test that was negative and I was meant to do a final test, and that was positive,” Mazzone said. While her brother, who was vaccinated, remained Covid-free, the unexpected result caused chaos. The pair immediately tried to physically distance as best they could while they worked out what to do next. Though they were supposed to receive a call with instructions, none ever came. Mazzone said they spent the day calling health authorities for details but had a “different answer for every person we spoke to”. Mazzone decided to take matters into her own hands by booking an Airbnb at a cost of $500 a day to isolate for 14 days, which has left her in debt. “It feels like it’s the first wave in Adelaide, like no one’s experienced Covid before. Even coming in through Melbourne, it seems like no one knew what the right thing to do was.” Others like Alex, who is chronically ill, began isolating as a pre-emptive measure when they saw case numbers start to climb, in a practice known as “shielding”. The 30-year-old, who did not wish to be identified and who lives with myalgic encephalomyelitis, otherwise known as chronic fatigue syndrome, spends most of their day in bed and relies on the help of their carer. They have struggled to apply for the NDIS, and have had to privately fundraise to pay for care. Alex, who is vaccinated, is not just worried about dying from Covid, but after-effects like long Covid that will make their circumstances worse. Their isolation has taken on “another layer” as their carer and two friends who helped with groceries have been exposed, and are isolating while waiting for test results. Until their results came, Alex said they would be on their own and having to triage basic tasks.
“Basically the level of care that I need is very high, so whenever I have to exert myself, like cleaning stuff, sanitising all the stuff coming in, it takes so much out of me,” Alex said. “I just prioritise where I put my energy each day. So it’s like: OK, I’m meant to shower today, do I shower, do I make sure I’m having three meals?” Alex said for all the talk about “living with Covid” and allowing it to spread, disabled people were being left to carry the cost – often without government support. “It’s not just disabled people shielding, but the people who care for us, that we rely on,” they said. “There’s a shortage of people who are caring for us. “A lot of people are going to wind up getting disabled from long Covid, and the system already doesn’t support chronically ill, disabled people enough.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/thousands-of-australians-are-isolating-with-covid-heres-how-some-of-them-are-coping
5890;5890;Rapid antigen Covid test supplies to remain ‘bumpy’ over next two weeks;2022-01-03T03:51:43Z;['Mostafa Rachwani'];['Health', 'New South Wales', 'Australia news', 'Victoria', 'Coronavirus'];"Obtaining rapid antigen tests over the next two weeks is likely to remain “bumpy” across Australia as supply chain issues cause shortages and price spikes. Distributing the tests is something “still being worked out with the government”, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia has said. The guild’s national president, Trent Twomey, said price rises were “coming from distributors and manufacturers who are paying extra to get stock to Australia, even chartering jets to get supplies here. Those costs are being passed on.” • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
He said “the national shortage is due in part to the fact that the government’s pivot from PCR tests being the main testing regimen to RATs becoming the main one was done without warning so pharmacies could not order stock in preparation for the rush”. Twomey said customers can expect more tests to be available by mid-January, but that the situation would remain “bumpy” in the meantime.
This comes as the Queensland government said it has secured 18m new rapid antigen tests, 12m of which will be for home testing and 6m for use in the hospital system. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the tests will arrive in “smaller numbers” in the short term, with a “large volume expected in late January”. “Global demand for the test kits is significant and securing this supply will support new national protocols for close contacts and frontline workforces,” she tweeted.
Palaszczuk said the tests would be distributed for free at testing sites to close contacts and Covid positive patients, unlike in Victoria and New South Wales, where there is still confusion as to how the tests will be distributed. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said on Friday that “vulnerable and disadvantaged communities” will have priority access to the 50m tests his government has ordered, but could not provide further details. In Victoria, the health minister, Martin Foley, said residents can expect more rapid antigen tests to be made available in the “coming days”, after the government announced it had secured 34m kits in late December. “We await the vagaries of the international air freight industry, but our expectation is in the coming days of this week, the first initial arrival of those rapid antigen tests will begin to arrive,” he said. Foley said the state government was “working” on the distribution model for the tests, mentioning the need to get the kits to vulnerable Victorians, but did not provide any details on how that would work. “Clearly, until such a time as we get really significant consistent supplies across both government-provided services and other services, they will be in short supply,” he said.
Foley said he believed the distribution of the tests will be discussed at the national cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced earlier on Monday that the tests would not be made free, but the federal government was working on concessional arrangements, split 50-50 with the states. The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, defended the government’s approach to the distribution of the tests, saying the government had already paid $2.5bn for free PCR tests. “We can’t make every product for free. What we do is provide it to those most vulnerable in those settings and particularly the aged care system, and working through the public health orders to meet the costs with the states on a 50-50 basis,” he said on ABC News Breakfast. “Significant amounts of rapid antigen tests are making their way to Australia.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/rapid-antigen-covid-test-supplies-to-remain-bumpy-over-next-two-weeks

Outbreaks of the Omicron variant have now taken hold in Cherbourg and Palm Island, which both have relatively low vaccination rates compared with the wider population. In Cherbourg, about 250km north-west of Brisbane, there were 90 confirmed cases on Monday, mainly among younger people. Two are in hospital and one is in intensive care. The vaccination rate in Cherbourg is below 60%. • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Health officials said there was one confirmed case on Palm Island, though local reports suggest there are at least six more. Only 44% of people on Palm Island have received two doses of a Covid vaccine and health teams will go door to door later this week in an attempt to lift the rate. Queensland reported 4,249 new Covid cases in the 24 hours to 7pm on Sunday. The state also reported a suspected Covid death, the first of the new outbreak and only the eighth in Queensland since the onset of the pandemic.
The chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, said the man in his late 30s died suddenly in his Gold Coast home overnight. The state coroner is investigating the circumstances. Gerrard said the rapid spread of the Omicron variant was likely to continue and peak at “very large numbers” in late January or early February. Of more than 20,000 active cases in Queensland, only 10 people were in intensive care on Monday and only one of those required a ventilator. “We are expecting in the next few weeks very substantial numbers of people are going to be infected. I think we just have to assume that all of us are going to be exposed in the next few weeks,” Gerrard said. “The Omicron strain is so different. The modelling is very difficult to interpret. All I can say is that we can expect very large numbers of cases and in the majority of cases, the vast majority of cases, the symptoms will be mild. So clearly the vaccine is working.” Gerrard said the outbreak on Palm Island was “not surprising”. “It’s going to spread there as it has elsewhere,” he said. The Palm Island mayor, Mislam Sam, told the ABC the mood on the island was tense. “I’ve been out checking on everyone … getting out there and just allaying some fears that might be growing in the community,” he said. “We’ve got a high population with serious underlying health issues, so no doubt it’s going to be stressing and depressing for most of my community. “We always forecast that one case could turn to 100 overnight because of how closely connected our community is and the level of overcrowding in houses.”
Asked what the government was doing to help vulnerable people in overcrowded homes in Indigenous communities, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said those people should get vaccinated. “What we’re doing is telling people to go and get vaccinated. We have … given every Queenslander in this state the opportunity to get vaccinated,” she said. “Unfortunately, there has been some negative social media posts going around that have had a negative impact [on vaccination rates] in our Indigenous communities. “I’m now urging people in those Indigenous communities to ignore those social media posts and immediately go and get your vaccination.” Palaszczuk announced the state had secured 18m rapid antigen tests that would be supplied free to some people, including identified close contacts, at public testing centres.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/all-of-us-are-going-to-be-exposed-to-omicron-queensland-chief-health-officer-warns
5892;5892;British DJ escapes prosecution after sparking New Zealand’s first Omicron scare;2022-01-03T02:36:16Z;['Helen Livingstone'];['New Zealand', 'Coronavirus', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news'];"A British DJ who triggered New Zealand’s first Omicron scare after breaking home isolation rules will not be prosecuted for the time being, authorities say. “The Ministry of Health does not plan to refer this case to the police at this stage,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that it “needs to balance the deterrence effect from any potential prosecution with enabling an environment that does not discourage future cases from assisting with the public health response to Covid-19”. Robert Etheridge, also known as DJ Dimension, arrived in New Zealand on 16 December and spent seven days in one of the country’s managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) facilities, where he returned three negative Covid test results, Stuff reported.
After leaving MIQ he was required to spend three days in home isolation but did not wait to receive a negative day-nine test – as also required – before entering the community. According to the ministry, he visited a series of venues in Auckland over two days including nightclubs, a shopping precinct and restaurants before receiving a positive test result on 27 December and being returned to MIQ. Etheridge, who had been due to play at the Rhythm and Alps festival near Wanaka last week, apologised to “those who I have inadvertently put at risk as a result of my misunderstandings”. “I realise the gravity of the situation and I am deeply regretful to those who have been impacted.” In an earlier statement he said: “After completing my 10-day isolation, and of the understanding that I had completed my quarantine, I entered the community. To my shock and enormous concern, I unexpectedly received a positive test on day 12, two days after my isolation period had ended.” His case triggered outrage in New Zealand, which has frequently been praised for its pandemic response and which only recently lifted lockdown restrictions on Auckland, its largest city, after a Delta outbreak. Despite identifying dozens of close contacts, the ministry said on Monday that none had so far tested positive for the virus. Covid cases are currently trending downwards in New Zealand, with just 27 new community cases announced on Monday and 24 at the border.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/british-dj-escapes-prosecution-after-sparking-new-zealands-first-omicron-scare
5893;5893;Scott Morrison resists calls to provide free rapid Covid tests to Australians;2022-01-03T01:35:56Z;['Sarah Martin'];['Australia news', 'Australian politics', 'Coronavirus', 'New South Wales'];"Scott Morrison has resisted calls to make rapid antigen tests (RATs) free across the country as he insists the health system can manage the “very different virus” of the Omicron variant. Despite growing pressure to provide free tests more widely – including to vulnerable and low-income groups – the prime minister said subsidised tests would remain limited to people who were close contacts with symptoms. “We’re now in a stage of the pandemic where you can’t just make everything free,” Morrison told Channel 7’s Sunrise program on Monday. “When someone tells you they want to make something free, someone’s always going to pay for it, and it’s going to be you.” However, he said the government was finalising arrangements to provide concessional access to the tests with costs split 50-50 with the states. He also said that the government’s policy on subsidised tests sent a clear message to the private market that “they can now go and stock their shelves with confidence that they won’t be undercut by the government.”
The Pharmacy Guild and the Australian Medical Association have both criticised the federal government’s handling of the switch to rapid antigen testing as Australians struggle to access the take-home kits from the private market. Last Thursday, national cabinet agreed to change the testing regime for close and casual contacts, switching to a reliance on rapid antigen tests as the country’s PCR testing centres became overwhelmed by demand. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, criticised the government for failing to secure enough RATs, accusing Morrison of again offering “too little too late”. “This has been an example of something that has characterised Scott Morrison’s prime ministership. He identifies a problem only after it becomes a crisis, and then he doesn’t act. He just seems to blame someone else,” Albanese said at a press conference in Newcastle on Monday. “The government has told people to not go and get tested, but to test themselves with a rapid antigen test that isn’t available, and that isn’t affordable. This is a public policy failure the likes of which we haven’t seen in this country before.” He said that at the “very least”, tests should be made freely available to people who could not afford them. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said the government was in the process of securing more RATs and 100m would come into Australia over the next two months. He criticised Labor for suggesting the tests should be freely available. “If there were an unconstrained flow of completely unpriced products – so if there was an infinite supply to an infinite number of people, then, of course, that demand couldn’t be met,” Hunt said. “The common sense of providing an infinite supply of free goods somehow has been lost in this discussion.”
He said it would be up to the states to decide if they wanted to forgo GST revenue on the sale of the rapid antigen tests, as had occurred with women’s sanitary products. New South Wales recorded 20,794 new Covid cases on Monday, with Victoria recording 8,577 and Queensland 4,249. Experts warned the health system faced being overwhelmed, but Morrison also urged people not to focus on case numbers. “The key point I think we’ve all got to come to terms with is we’ve gear-changed with Omicron,” he later told Channel 9. “So the requirements for testing, the requirements for isolation, all of these things have changed because Omicron we now know is about 75% less virulent, less severe than the Delta variant.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
“So we’re now dealing with a very different virus and so we’ve really got to change the way we think about it, and that’s why talking about case numbers now is really not the point.” He said lockdowns were in the past, rising case numbers were part of the “new phase of the pandemic” and those in hospital were most likely to be unvaccinated or infected with the Delta strain.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/scott-morrison-resists-calls-to-provide-free-rapid-covid-tests-to-australians
5894;5894;Unite demands clear targets for use of UK steel in HS2 project;2022-01-03T00:01:31Z;['Miles Brignall'];['HS2', 'Steel industry', 'Rail industry', 'Trade unions', 'Business', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"The Unite union is demanding the government sets clear targets for the use of UK-produced steel in the HS2 rail project, after it emerged that the Department for Transport currently has none in place. Responding to two written questions in parliament posted by Labour MPs in December, the transport minister Andrew Stephenson admitted there is “no formal target” for the use of UK steel in its construction. Despite cuts to the original plan, HS2 is still a major part of the UK’s £96bn integrated rail plan and will be the largest building project in Europe, requiring millions of tonnes of steel to build the tracks, stations and tunnels. Unite said the UK’s exit from the European Union should have made it easier for the government to ensure that British products were used in infrastructure projects. More than 33,000 people are employed in 1,100 steel businesses across the UK. Questions over HS2’s sourcing came in October after it emerged that the French firm Sendin had supplied the project with more than 2,000 tonnes of steel. At the time HS2 said its contractor had approached all suitable alternative UK suppliers, but none could provide the necessary product in time. HS2 said 97% of all businesses the project has worked with throughout its supply chains were British. “The government must immediately develop clear targets on UK steel usage on publicly funded construction projects,” said the Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham. “In the case of HS2, UK producers should have a paramount place in producing steel for the project. Surely that is economic common sense? This failure of the government’s procurement policies will be challenged by my union. You could not make it up,” Graham said.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “HS2 is a once in a generation investment in the UK’s transport infrastructure and we expect it to have a lasting impact on jobs, skills and businesses here in the UK. “The government and HS2 Ltd have engaged extensively with the British steel industry over the last five years to ensure that it is in the best possible position to compete for contracts.”
Last week, the Guardian revealed that the UK steel industry was braced for an immediate slump in trade after the EU and the US reached an agreement to remove tariffs on a quota of steel and aluminium imported from the bloc to the US from 1 January. Tariffs will remain on all UK steel and aluminium exports after the UK government talks failed to secure a matching breakthrough.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/unite-demands-clear-targets-for-use-of-uk-steel-in-hs2-project
5895;5895;UK motorist caught driving while distracted nine times in four years;2022-01-03T00:01:31Z;['Jessica Murray'];['Road safety', 'UK news', 'Motoring', 'Road transport', 'Transport policy', 'Law', 'Transport'];"A motorist was caught driving while distracted nine times in the past four years, new figures reveal, with road safety campaigners calling for repeat offenders to have their licences revoked. The person, who has not been identified, was among 932 British drivers convicted for the offence more than once over that period. Twenty-seven drivers were caught between three and five times, 904 were caught twice and 90,057 were caught once, according to the figures obtained by the PA Media news agency. The statistics, released by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in response to a freedom of information request, are a snapshot of the number of CU80 offences on driving records on 13 November. A CU80 offence is defined as a “breach of requirements as to control of the vehicle, such as using a mobile phone”, comes with three to six penalty points and must stay on a driving record for four years from the date of the offence. Jason Wakeford, the head of campaigns at road safety charity Brake, said: “It’s alarming to see repeat offenders, who have had ample opportunity to change their behaviour, still on the roads and putting other people at risk. “We believe that drivers who regularly disregard the law should have their licences revoked. This would help save lives, prevent needless injuries, and send a clear signal that driving is a privilege and not a right.”
The RAC road safety spokesperson Simon Williams said: “Sadly, these figures demonstrate that far too many drivers are still breaking the law and putting others on the road needlessly at risk. Worryingly, the RAC’s research shows that a quarter of drivers are still making or receiving calls with a handheld phone while driving, and incredibly a small but sizeable proportion even admit to filming videos or playing games at the wheel.” If a driver accrues 12 or more points within three years, they can be disqualified. But courts have discretion to allow offenders to keep driving if they are able to prove extenuating circumstances, including when a ban would cause extreme financial hardship. The DVLA said just 506 of the 90,989 motorists with the CU80 endorsements on their record were disqualified as a result. It has not been revealed whether the person with nine CU80s was among those banned. Under current UK laws, drivers are banned from texting or making a phone call with a handheld device, other than in an emergency. Tougher rules prohibiting people from taking photos or videos, scrolling through playlists or playing games on their phones when driving will be introduced this year.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/uk-motorist-caught-driving-while-distracted-nine-times-in-four-years
5896;5896;Volunteers praised for huge role in giving UK public Covid jabs;2022-01-03T00:00:31Z;['Jessica Murray'];['Coronavirus', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'UK news', 'NHS', 'Health', 'Society'];"Tens of thousands of vaccine volunteers have been praised for giving up about two million hours of their time to help with the rollout of Covid jabs throughout 2021. A woman who translated crucial health messages into Punjabi to reach more communities is among more than 100,000 people who donated their time to the vaccine effort in the past year. More than 132m coronavirus jabs were given last year in the largest vaccine campaign in British history. More than 90% of people in the UK over the age of 12 have now had their first dose of a Covid-19 jab and 82.4% have had their second. After the emergence of the Omicron variant triggered an acceleration of the rollout over the festive season, more than 1.6 million people received their booster dose in the final week of 2021, bringing the total number of boosted adults in the UK to nearly 34 million, including three in four eligible adults in England.
NHS England said volunteers working alongside healthcare staff had particularly helped during the ramped-up supply of jabs and boosters in December. The health service launched a recruitment drive to speed up the distribution of jabs and so far 17,500 people have registered their interest in paid vaccination roles, NHS England said.
A further 48,000 people have registered as steward volunteers through the NHS Volunteer Responders programme in just over a month, of which more than 10,000 have already deployed. Working alongside the NHS, St John Ambulance has seen 17,000 people come forward to do shifts as volunteer vaccinators. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said the success of the vaccination programme was “astounding and a true reflection of the fantastic work of our NHS and its volunteers. I want to thank each and every one of them”. NHS England’s chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, said the efforts of volunteers would “undoubtedly help to save many more lives”.
She said: “Alongside NHS staff, our selfless volunteers have worked tirelessly to protect the nation – in football stadiums, shopping centres, Christmas markets and countless other vaccination sites up and down the country. “I want to give my personal thanks to everyone who has given up their time to help us beat record after record – continuing to make the NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme the biggest and most successful in health service history.” Boris Johnson set the target of offering all eligible adults the chance to get their booster jabs by the end of January, but after the emergence of Omicron he brought forward the deadline to the new year. Millions of people queued at about 3,000 vaccination centres, and on 18 December NHS England administered a record 830,000 jabs in a single day. Jaz Kaur Bangerh, from Leeds, has been promoting messages about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in ethnic minority communities, including translating information into Punjabi. “Volunteering for the vaccination programme, I have helped people to fill in forms, guided them to the right place and answered any questions, especially if they were a bit anxious in the early days, when there was a lot of information out there.” John Hardman, who has volunteered at jab sites in the capital including Wembley stadium and the Science Museum, said he “can’t recommend it [volunteering] enough”. “There are lots of opportunities to support locally, even if just for a few sessions.” NHS England said people interested in getting involved can search NHS vaccine team online.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/volunteers-praised-for-huge-role-in-giving-uk-public-covid-jabs

It was vindication time for striker De Jong after several media reports that Barça want to move him on this month. He got his second goal since arriving from Sevilla in the close season – his first for more than three months. The Dutchman was Barca’s best player on Sunday as he also hit the post twice in the first half, once with a bicycle kick. The goal came just before the break when he headed home from close range after a cross by Óscar Mingueza.
Barça dominated the game until the final minutes when Mallorca started pressing for an equaliser and almost got it. Ter Stegen saved Barca in added time with an unbelievable handball-style reflex save with his right arm, denying Jaume Costa whose close-range strike looked like a sure goal. “It was an historic win for us, I’m not exaggerating,” Xavi said. “Missing so many players, to go back home with a win – it’s three points worth their weight in gold. The young players showed up and Ter Stegen made a stop for the ages. I’m thrilled that we managed to win.” Earlier on Sunday Getafe had ended Real Madrid’s 15-game unbeaten streak with a 1-0 victory in the capital derby. Enes Unal got the hosts’ winner in the ninth minute after he stole the ball from Éder Militão and beat Thibaut Courtois. Luka Modric hit the crossbar while Eden Hazard and Marcelo came on as half-time substitutions but Getafe dug in to earn their first victory over their star-studded crosstown rivals since August 2012. “We can’t get carried away by this loss,” Ancelotti said, after his side looked slack on the return from La Liga’s winter break. “We are still leaders and are excited about what is to come. A player who normally stands out for his defensive play gifted them their goal. There is not much more to say, except that it looked like we thought we were still on vacation.” Ángel Correa scored twice as Atlético Madrid beat Rayo Vallecano 2-0 to end their worst losing run since Diego Simeone took over the club a decade ago. The defending champions had not lost more than two league games in a row under Simeone but finished 2021 with consecutive defeats to Mallorca, Madrid, Sevilla and Granada. Atlético leapfrogged Rayo to reclaim fourth place, the last spot that will earn a Champions League berth.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/real-madrid-unbeaten-run-la-liga-getafe-atletico-barcelona
5898;5898;Russia ‘very likely’ to invade Ukraine without ‘enormous sanctions’ – Schiff;2022-01-02T22:39:48Z;['Martin Pengelly'];['Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Nato', 'US news', 'US foreign policy', 'US national security', 'US Congress', 'US politics', 'World news', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Volodymyr Zelenskiy', 'Joe Biden', 'Biden administration'];"Russia is “very likely” to invade Ukraine and might only be deterred by “enormous sanctions”, the chair of the US House intelligence committee said on Sunday.
Adam Schiff also said an invasion could backfire on Moscow, by drawing more countries into the Nato military alliance. “I also think that a powerful deterrent is the understanding that if they do invade, it is going to bring Nato closer to Russia, not push it farther away,” he said. After the California Democrat spoke, the White House said Joe Biden had spoken to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said in a statement: “President Biden made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.” On Twitter, Zelenskiy said: “The first international talk of the year with [Biden] proves the special nature of our relations.” He also said the joint actions of Ukraine, the US “and partners in keeping peace in Europe, preventing further escalation, reforms, deoligarchisation were discussed. We appreciate the unwavering support of Ukraine.” Russia has amassed around 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine. Earlier this week, Biden told Vladimir Putin the US would impose serious sanctions if Russia attacked. Talks are scheduled for Geneva on 9 and 10 January. But amid tensions heightened by both sides’ possession of nuclear weapons, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said that if “the west continues its aggressive line, Russia will be forced to take all necessary measures to ensure strategic balance and eliminate unacceptable threats to our security”. Russia has for years complained about Nato encroachment. Ukraine is not a member of the alliance, which guarantees collective defence, but Nato has expanded eastwards since the fall of the Soviet Union and Kiev urgently seeks admission. Russia invaded Ukrainian territory in 2014, annexing Crimea. The US has supplied “small” arms to Ukraine. On CBS’s Face the Nation, Schiff was asked what would stop Putin ordering an invasion. “I think that it would require enormous sanctions on Russia to deter what appears to be a very likely Russian invasion of Ukraine again,” Schiff said. “And I think our allies need to be solidly on board with it. Russia needs to understand we are united in this.”
An invasion, Schiff said, would see “more Nato assets closer to Russia. [It] will have the opposite impact of what Putin is trying to achieve”. Schiff said he had “no problem” with “going after Putin personally”, but thought “sector-sized sanctions will be the most important”. Asked if he thought scheduled talks had any chance of averting an invasion, he said: “I fear that Putin is very likely to invade. I still frankly don’t understand the full motivation for why now he’s doing this, but he certainly appears intent on it unless we can persuade him otherwise. “And I think nothing other than a level of sanctions that Russia has never seen will deter him, and that’s exactly what we need to do with our allies.” Reuters contributed to this report";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/russia-invade-ukraine-enormous-sanctions-schiff
5899;5899;Anne review – Maxine Peake exudes raw horror in extraordinary Hillsborough drama;2022-01-02T22:15:29Z;['Jack Seale'];['Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture'];"‘I lost my boy. Kevin Williams. I’m his mum. Anne.” Episode one of Anne, ITV’s measured bio-drama about the Hillsborough campaigner Anne Williams, ends with a small moment that carries the most profound significance. For an hour we’ve watched Williams (Maxine Peake), whose 15-year-old son Kevin was one of the 97 Liverpool fans killed by a terrace crush at the FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield on 15 April 1989, being battered and swayed by the loss of her child and the agony of not knowing exactly how and why Kevin died. At times she has hidden, sitting smoking late into the night or spending hopeless mornings in bed. But not now. Now, at her first meeting of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, she has stood up to say Kevin’s name and her own out loud. A life’s mission has begun. Future episodes will document how Williams spent nearly a quarter of a century before her death in 2013 challenging official narratives around the disaster, specifically the claim that Kevin could not have been alive beyond 3.15pm on the day of the match, and therefore could not have been saved. The story is one of solidarity in the face of injustice, unending parental love and the confounding ways in which grief can be an inspiration as well as a burden. First, though, the series has to perform faithful groundwork. Opening instalments of dramas like this are difficult. They have to show the life before, that we know is to be ripped apart, without the dramatic ironies becoming heavy. They must show us how events turn an ordinary person into our extraordinary protagonist, but not foreshadow their destiny too blatantly. Anne avoids these traps with assurance. The quick sketch of Kevin (Campbell Wallace) railroading Williams and her husband Steve into letting him go to the game, is all the more affecting for how unremarkable it is: every parent of a teenager knows how it feels to weigh up demands to let them go here or there, never sure if those things are safe. That point is made with minimal fuss, an approach also taken to another potential cliche of the genre – the moment when the catastrophe has a mystical effect on those who cannot know about it yet. On the afternoon of 15 April, Kevin’s sister is playing in the garden. At 3.05pm, just as the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest is abandoned, the sun goes in and the air turns cold. From there, the episode is a tapestry of awful incidents tenderly observed, a study of the bewildering eeriness of bereavement. Death means strangers coming to the house; trips to meet other strangers in unfamiliar buildings must be made. For Anne and Steve Williams, that oddness is intensely magnified. The day after the game, they enter the ad hoc system set up in Sheffield to name victims and find loved ones. They move, stunned, through musty halls full of trestle tables, clipboard-wielding volunteers and anxious or already bereft parents, before an appalling scene in a tiny room. Grotesque Polaroids of the unidentified dead are on a noticeboard, numbered. Anne is desperate not to admit it, so Steve (Stephen Walters) has to step forward and say it: Kevin is number fifty-one. Walters and Peake convey the raw horror of the moment with an almost unwatchable intensity. As for strangers at the house, those people include a tabloid reporter posing as a delivery man before taunting the Williamses with The Sun’s despicable THE TRUTH edition and trying to steal a framed family photograph. The programme is careful to acknowledge the heinous behaviour of the press, but the key scene is a visit in 1991 by an Inspector of the West Midlands Police, played with patrician chicanery by Mark Dexter. Ignore the testimonies at the inquest that Kevin was seen alive after 3.15pm, the Inspector says. Those witnesses have realised their mistake and changed their story. Don’t worry about it. The man is instructing Anne Williams, after two years of intense pain and no clear answers, to deny her instincts and accept what she is told. That this is something Anne is not wired to do is what makes Peake, an apparently pale, frail presence with fire beneath her skin, ideal casting. She does the hard yards first, showing us the times when Williams is confused and fallible and nearly beaten by sadness. But by the end of episode one she’s ready to unleash the righteous strength of a working-class woman who has been wronged. In both modes, Peake embodies the role in life that Anne Williams would fulfil with the highest possible distinction: Kevin’s mum.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/02/anne-review-maxine-peake-exudes-raw-horror-in-extraordinary-hillsborough-drama

If you’re not getting this as an email, you could be by signing up in the box below. If you are getting this as an email, there will be no box. Perhaps you could pass this on to a friend who isn’t subscribed, but might like to, so they can tell you what the box looks like.
NSW has come into 2022 swinging, with the highest positive Covid-test rate in the world (haha, I am terrified). What does “positive test rate” mean? Here’s a handy explainer from Michael McGowan. You can follow all the day’s Covid developments, along with other breaking news on our live blog. And in world news, the chair of the US house intelligence committee is saying Russia is “very likely” to invade Ukraine, and proposing “enormous sanctions” to deter them. Now, onto the reads, which to give you a nice break are resolution themed today. 1. If you resolved to read less Covid-content, but crave high stakes medical reporting Read about the mysterious cluster of neurological illness affecting younger people in New Brunswick, Canada. Notable quote: “I’m truly concerned about these cases because they seem to evolve so fast,” said the whistleblower, who revealed the cluster and is speaking under the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. “I’m worried for them and we owe them some kind of explanation.” How long will it take to read? About three minutes. Bonus read: If that’s a bit grim for this morning, perhaps you’ll find Tory Shepherd on super poo, designer gut bacteria and the quest to develop a poo pellet you can swallow a bit more, ah, palatable? 2. If you resolved to improve your focus
Read Johann Hari on how your attention was stolen from you, and critically, how to get it back again. Who stole it? Who else? Big tech. But there are other villains too. Notable quote: Here’s James Williams, a Google engineer turned philosopher of attention, on why switching your phone off is “not the solution”: “For the same reason that wearing a gas mask for two days a week outside isn’t the answer to pollution.” How long will it take to read? About eight minutes. Go on, you can do it! 3. If you resolved to make more money this year Read what happens when you let out your house as a production set, from blood splatter that never fully fades, to “riches … for literally just being out of the house for a day” (it was $300, and the film was X-rated). Have I seen any of the houses? If you’ve seen Animal Kingdom, Mr Inbetween or ABC’s Hardball, then yes. Do you get to meet celebrities? Also yes! If you’re really lucky, Ben Mendelsohn will feed bacon to your dog.
4. If you’ve resolved to broaden your social horizons Here’s Sophie Black on how the pandemic normalised friendship “pruning”: whether by accident or design, and whether connection can get back to normal. Thought to ponder: “It helps to start by asking ourselves exactly what friends are for.” How long will it take me to read? About five minutes, much quicker than the estimated 90 hours it takes to make a new close friend. 5. If resolutions are too bloody hard How about an easy win instead? Like writing a not-to-do list.
Tell me more? No, you can read the whole story in under a minute, but I will tell you about two other easy wins: slightly extending your commute; and reaching out to an old friend. Is this a thing now? Yes, Guardian Australia’s team will be writing about a new easy, achievable goal every day this January.

Black children are also now more than twice as likely to be growing up poor as white children, according to the Labour party research, which was based on government figures for households that have a “relative low income” – defined as being below 60% of the median, the standard definition for poverty. And over the last decade the total number of black children in poor households more than doubled – although that increase is partly explained by the overall size of the cohort increasing too. The proportion of black children living in poverty went up from 42% in 2010-11 to 53% in 2019-20, the most recent year for which the data is available. The figures were released to the Guardian by the Labour party, which described them as evidence of “Conservative incompetence and denialism about the existence of structural racism”.
The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has already committed the party to passing a new race equality act, if elected, to tackle structural racism. Further details of what this would entail are expected to be fleshed out in 2022. The party produced its figures by cross-referencing data from the Department for Work and Pensions’ reports on households below average income with population statistics. In 2019-20 4.3 million children (defined as people under 16, or aged 16 to 19 and in full-time education) were living in households in poverty. They accounted for 31% of the UK’s 14 million children. But there was a wide variation among ethnic groups. The Labour research covered nine categories and it said Bangladeshi children are the poorest, with 61% of them living in a poor household. The figures for the other groups were: Pakistani children (55%); black African or Caribbean or black British (53%); other ethnicity (51%); other Asian (50%); mixed ethnicity (32%); Indian (27%); white (26%); and Chinese (12%). There are 2.9 million white children living in poverty, making them by far the largest ethnic cohort, comprising 68% of all children living in poverty. Black children are the next biggest group: with more than 400,000 living in poverty, they comprise 10% of the child poverty total. The Labour figures show that, among some ethnic groups, children are just as likely now to be living in poverty as they were a decade ago. In 2010-11, 61% of Bangladeshi children were living in poor households – exactly the same figure as at the end of the decade. For Indian children, the chances of living in a poor household have fallen from 34% a decade ago to 27%. For Chinese children, the figure has fallen from 47% to 12%. But for white children, the figure has risen from 24% to 26%; for Pakistani children, it has gone up from 50% to 55%; and for black children it has increased from 42% to 53%. Overall, 27% of all children were living in poor households in 2010-11; the latest figure is 31%. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, whose office produced the figures, said the Conservatives should be ashamed of what they revealed. “There is little wonder that child poverty has skyrocketed over the last decade when Conservative ministers have done so little to tackle the structural inequalities driving it,” she said. “Conservative incompetence and denialism about the existence of structural racism are driving black children into poverty. Labour has a plan to lift them out of it, with a new race equality act to tackle structural racial inequality at source.” Labour announced its commitment to a race equality act as it published a review last year by Doreen Lawrence, the peer, into the disproportionate impact of Covid on minority ethnic communities. The party has not said exactly what its act would contain, but the Lawrence recommendations, which the party has accepted, would shape its contents. Although much of the Lawrence report focused on Covid-specific issues, it also said the virus had “thrived on structural inequalities that have long scarred British society”. Its recommendations included forcing large employers to publish data on ethnicity pay gaps, having clear targets to close the attainment gap for children and implementing a race equality strategy that has the support of minority ethnic communities. Halima Begum, chief executive at the Runnymede Trust, the race equality thinktank, said the Labour figures, although not surprising, were nevertheless “cause for considerable concern”. She said: “These are not cyclical inequalities that are being flagged, but systemic shortcomings that must be reversed quickly. “But the problems are nuanced. Black children face racism and poverty. But poverty is not defined exclusively by race. So, for more than a decade, the Runnymede Trust has argued that you can’t simply solve the issue of racial inequality without also addressing socio-economic disparities.” In response to Labour claims that the figures were an indictment of its record, a government spokesperson highlighted separate figures showing that in 2019-20 there were 300,000 fewer children living in absolute low income, after housing costs, than there were in 2010. Absolute low income is defined as below the figure for 60% of median income for 2010, adjusted for inflation. People can fall out of absolute low income if their incomes rise by more than inflation, but can remain in relative low income – the more commonly used benchmark – if other people’s incomes rise by proportionally more. The spokesperson said: “The latest official figures show there were 300,000 fewer children of all backgrounds in poverty after housing costs than in 2010 and we continue to provide extensive support to reduce this number further. “This includes putting £1,000 more per year on average into the pockets of the lowest earners through changes to universal credit, increasing the minimum wage next April to £9.50 per hour and helping with the cost of fuel bills.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/more-than-half-of-uks-black-children-live-in-poverty-analysis-shows
5902;5902;‘He is no longer a Buc’: Brady grounds Jets after Brown’s bizarre shirtless exit;2022-01-02T21:53:46Z;['N/A'];['NFL', 'Sport', 'US sports'];"Antonio Brown was apparently frustrated and angry. So he walked away. From the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And possibly his NFL career. The mercurial wide receiver was kicked off the Buccaneers after a bizarre, shirtless exit from the field before Tom Brady coolly led the Bucs on a 93-yard drive in the final minutes for a 28-24 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday. Coach Bruce Arians said after the game Brown was off the team. “He is no longer a Buc,” Arians said. “All right? That’s the end of the story. Let’s talk about the guys who went out there and won the game.” Brown’s mid-game meltdown came late in the third quarter with Tampa Bay trailing 24-10. He appeared animated while talking to Mike Evans, who tried to calm his teammate. But Brown stripped off his pads, jersey, gloves and T-shirt – tossing the gloves and T-shirt into the stands – and then walked bare-chested down the sideline and into the end zone. He then waved to fans as jogged through the end zone and into the tunnel at MetLife Stadium.
It appeared to be a show of frustration by Brown, who had three catches for 26 yards. “I’m not talking about it,” Arians said. “He’s not part of the Bucs.” Brown was suspended last month for three games for violating the league’s Covid-19 protocols. He also has a history of personal conduct issues and bizarre behavior. “It’s a difficult situation,” Brady said. “Everybody should do what they can to help him in ways that he really needs it. We all love him. We care about him deeply. We want to see him be at his best. Unfortunately, it won’t be with our team. ... I think everyone should be very compassionate and empathetic toward some very difficult things that are happening.” Brady connected with Cameron Brate for a touchdown on fourth-and-goal from the four shortly after Brown’s exit, and the QB finished the Bucs’ rally with a 33-yard touchdown pass to Cyril Grayson with 15 seconds left. The Bucs stuffed Jets QB Zach Wilson on fourth-and-2 at the seven for no gain with New York trying to seal the victory. New York coach Robert Saleh said the play should’ve been a reverse to wide receiver Braxton Berrios, but Wilson had the option to sneak it based on the look. “We did a very poor job of communicating that,” Saleh said, adding that ”it just makes you sick” because a handoff to Berrios would’ve likely been a first down. Instead, it gave Brady and the Bucs the ball back with 2:12 left. And that was more than enough time. Brady marched the Buccaneers (12-4) down the field on nine plays, zipping a pass to Grayson – who was elevated from the practice squad – for the go-ahead score. It was Brady’s third TD pass of the game and 40th of the season, joining him with Drew Brees as the only players to throw for 40 touchdowns in consecutive seasons. He finished 34 of 50 for 410 yards, the three TDs and an interception for Tampa Bay, which had Arians back after he tested positive for the coronavirus earlier in the week. Le’Veon Bell ran in the two-point conversion against his former team, forcing New York to need a touchdown. But the Jets (4-12) ran out of time. “We’ve been in some crazy situations before,” Arians said, “but this was a very special one to come back and win that game.” Kansas City Chiefs 31-34 Cincinnati Bengals Evan McPherson kicked a 20-yard field goal as time ran out, and the Cincinnati Bengals earned their first AFC North title and postseason appearance in six years with a wild 34-31 win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. Rookie Ja’Marr Chase had a franchise-record 266 yards receiving and three touchdowns on 11 catches, Joe Burrow threw for 466 yards and four scores while outdueling Patrick Mahomes, and the Bengals rallied from three 14-point deficits against the AFC West champs. The Bengals’ winning drive was filled with drama. On fourth-and-inches with under a minute left, the Bengals (10-6) decided to go for a touchdown instead of calling on McPherson for a field goal and giving the Chiefs the ball back with a chance to win. Burrow threw incomplete in the end zone, but Chiefs cornerback L’Jarius Sneed was flagged for illegal use of hands, giving the Bengals a fresh set of downs. Backup quarterback Brandon Allen was called on to kneel twice before McPherson came on for the game-winner. Burrow was outstanding again, completing 30 of 39 attempts. He was sacked four times and hit at least six more times but was as accurate as ever, and Chase caught everything that was thrown near him. Mahomes looked as if he had the game under control early. He threw two first-quarter touchdown passes to give the Chiefs the early lead, but he didn’t get another one. The Chiefs (11-5) led 14-0, 21-7 and 28-14 in the first half. They were ahead 28-17 at halftime before the Bengals began the latest of several second-half surges this season. Jacksonville Jaguars 10-50 New England Patriots New England returned to the playoffs when rookie quarterback Mac Jones threw three touchdown passes and Damien Harris and Rhamondre Stevenson rushed for two scores apiece in their 50-10 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. The victory by the Patriots (10-6) snapped a two-game losing streak and gave Bill Belichick his 20th 10-win season as a head coach, tying Don Shula for the most in NFL history. A loss by Miami at Tennessee secured New England’s first trip to the postseason since Tom Brady left for Tampa Bay following the 2019 season. The Jaguars (2-14) have lost eight consecutive games, including three straight since firing coach Urban Meyer. It was their 17th consecutive loss on the road, the longest streak in the league. Jones finished 22 of 30 for 227 yards and set a franchise record for touchdown passes by a rookie with 21. Stevenson had 107 yards on 19 carries. Harris rushed nine times for 35 yards before leaving in the second half with a hamstring injury. Patriots receiver Kristian Wilkerson had two touchdown catches – the first of his career – after being elevated from the practice squad for the second consecutive week. He pulled in a six-yard TD to put the Patriots up 21-3 in the second quarter. His second came on a 20-yard pass on their opening possession of the second half that stretched the lead to 34-3. New England’s defense also bounced back from a rough outing against Buffalo, holding the Jaguars to 253 yards and 3 of 9 on third downs. Myles Bryant, JC Jackson and Kyle Dugger all had interceptions. Miami Dolphins 3-34 Tennessee Titans Ryan Tannehill threw two touchdown passes as the Tennessee Titans clinched their second straight AFC South title Sunday, snapping the Miami Dolphins’ seven-game winning streak with a 34-3 win. The Titans (11-5) won their second straight overall and third in four games to clinch their first back-to-back division titles since the start of the AFL when this franchise was the Houston Oilers and won three straight Eastern Division championships. They also won 11 games for a second consecutive season for the first time since 2002-03 – and currently are the AFC’s top seed after Kansas City lost at Cincinnati. Miami came in as the first team in NFL history to win seven straight after a seven-game skid. That surge helped push the Dolphins into the third and final wild-card spot in the AFC, but this loss seriously damaged their playoff hopes. On a cold and rainy day, the Titans ran more than they threw. Tannehill was 13 of 18 for 120 yards and a 127.1 passer rating against the team that drafted him eighth overall in 2012 before trading him to Tennessee in March 2019. Tannehill is 31-15 as the Titans’ starter with his third straight playoff berth clinched. D’Onta Foreman ran for 132 yards and a TD. Dontrell Hilliard ran for a 39-yard TD as the Titans scored 10 points off a pair of turnovers by Tua Tagovailoa. Philadelphia Eagles 20-16 Washington Football Team Jalen Hurts scrambled out of trouble while showing no ill effects from a recent ankle injury, Boston Scott rushed for two touchdowns, and the Philadelphia Eagles held on to beat Washington 20-16 Sunday to move one step closer to the playoffs. Hurts ran six times for 45 yards and was 17 of 26 passing for 214 yards in leading the Eagles to a fourth consecutive victory. Pending other results around the NFL, they could have an NFC wild-card spot locked up by the end of the night. Philadelphia (9-7) started slowly yet again, and its league-leading rushing attack was held to a season-low 3.4 yards a carry with Miles Sanders out because of a broken left hand. Twelve days after racking up 238 yards on the ground against Washington (6-10), the Eagles had 119 yards rushing.
But the defense finally got to Taylor Heinicke, and the Eagles wore down a banged-up opponent, erasing a 16-7 deficit. Jake Elliott connected on field goals of 42 and 41 yards in the fourth quarter, and Rodney McLeod picked off Heinicke in the end zone with 24 seconds remaining to seal it. Philadelphia made the postseason for the first time since 2019 with Minnesota’s loss at Green Bay and San Francisco’s win over Houston later Sunday. Las Vegas Raiders 23-20 Indianapolis Colts Derek Carr directed Las Vegas to Daniel Carlson’s winning 33-yard field goal as time expired, and the Raiders beat Jonathan Taylor and the Indianapolis Colts 23-20 on Sunday to move one step closer to an AFC wild card. After Michael Badgley kicked a tying 41-yard field goal for Indianapolis with 1:56 left, Carr and the Raiders got the ball back at their 25 after a touchback. Carr found Hunter Renfrow for 24 yards on third-and-10 in the final minute, setting the stage for Carlson’s third field goal of the game. Carr passed for 255 yards and a touchdown for Las Vegas (9-7), and Zay Jones had eight receptions for 120 yards. Rallying after an embarrassing email scandal that led to coach Jon Gruden’s resignation, the Raiders can wrap up an improbable playoff spot with a victory over the Los Angeles Chargers next weekend. Indianapolis (9-7) had won three straight and eight of 10 to move one win away from a postseason berth. But it couldn’t hold a second-half lead against Las Vegas. New York Giants 3-29 Chicago Bears Robert Quinn broke Hall of Famer Richard Dent’s franchise single-season record with his 18th sack, and the Chicago Bears pounded the New York Giants 29-3 on Sunday.
Trevis Gipson added a career-high two sacks, and the Bears joined Green Bay as the only franchises with 800 victories counting the postseason. They also gave the embattled Matt Nagy a win in what might have been his final home game as their coach. Quinn broke Dent’s mark of 17 and a half set in 1984 when he took down Mike Glennon in the fourth quarter. By then, the Bears (6-10) were well on their way. Gipson had a strip-sack on the game’s first play from scrimmage and Tashaun Gipson picked off Glennon on the next possession. The two takeaways led to a scoring run by David Montgomery and touchdown catch by Darnell Mooney, making it 14-0 and sending the Monsters of the Midway to their second straight win after losing eight of nine. The Giants (4-12), who could also be in for changes, lost their fifth straight game. They set a season low in yards for the second week in a row, finishing with 151 after being held to 192 against Philadelphia. Los Angeles Rams 20-19 Baltimore Ravens Matthew Stafford shook off three turnovers to guide a fourth-quarter rally Sunday that carried the Los Angeles Rams to their fifth straight victory, 20-19 over the short-handed but stubborn Baltimore Ravens. Stafford threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to Odell Beckham Jr with 57 seconds left immediately after completing a five-yarder to Beckham on a fourth-and-5. After Los Angeles failed on a two-point conversion, the Ravens – playing a third straight game without injured quarterback Lamar Jackson – never got close enough for a field-goal try.
The victory pushed the Rams (12-4) to the cusp of their second straight NFC West title. Arizona needed to beat Dallas later Sunday to avoid elimination. At one point this season, Baltimore was 8-3 and the top seed in the AFC. The Ravens (8-8) have since lost five straight, their longest skid since a nine-game run in 2007 under Brian Billick paved the way for current coach John Harbaugh to take over in 2008. Four of those defeats during this slump have come by a total of five points. The loss ousted Baltimore from the AFC North title hunt. The Ravens were not officially eliminated from the playoff chase, but to get in as a wild card they’ll need a win next week and a whole lot of help. Atlanta Falcons 15-29 Buffalo Bills Buffalo clinched a playoff berth when Devin Singletary scored two touchdowns rushing in the second half to make up for Josh Allen’s sloppiness in a 29-15 victory over Atlanta that eliminated the Falcons from contention. The AFC East-leading Bills rallied to clinch their third consecutive playoff spot. Buffalo (10-6) did so by beating the Falcons, coupled with the Baltimore Ravens’ 20-19 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. The Falcons (7-9) went down swinging in being eliminated from the NFC race to extend their postseason drought to a fourth year in their first season under coach Arthur Smith. The Falcons forced four turnovers, with an injury and Covid-19-depleted secondary intercepting Allen on three consecutive possessions spanning halftime. Allen did a much better job running than throwing by scoring two touchdowns rushing on a snow-dusted field, and with temperatures in the low 20s. Buffalo won their third straight and needs only to beat the New York Jets in its finale next weekend to clinch its second consecutive division title – and assure the Bills home-field advantage for the wild-card playoff round. Houston Texans 7-23 San Francisco 49ers Rookie Trey Lance threw two touchdown passes in the second half of his second career start, and the San Francisco 49ers closed in on a playoff berth with a 23-7 victory over the Houston Texans on Sunday. Lance got the nod for the 49ers (9-7) for the first time since Week 5 with Jimmy Garoppolo sidelined by a thumb injury and overcame an interception in the first half to lead San Francisco to the win. The Niners can clinch their second playoff berth in five seasons under coach Kyle Shanahan with one loss by New Orleans or a win next week against the Rams. The Texans (4-12) struggled to get much of anything going offensively and failed in their attempt at their first three-game winning streak since 2018. Davis Mills went 21 for 32 for 163 yards, one touchdown and one interception, and Houston was held to 222 yards on offense. Detroit Lions 29-51 Seattle Seahawks Rashaad Penny rushed for a career-high 170 yards and two touchdowns, Russell Wilson threw three of his four TD passes to DK Metcalf, and the Seattle Seahawks routed the Detroit Lions 51-29 on Sunday. Seattle (6-10) closed out its home schedule with its most impressive offensive showing of the season, raising questions about where those fireworks have been for most of the disappointing year. Penny rumbled for 144 yards in the first half, while Wilson threw TD passes to Metcalf and Tyler Lockett as Seattle built a 31-7 halftime lead. Wilson added a third TD to Metcalf on the third play of the second half. Wilson finished 20 of 29 for 236 yards, while Metcalf had a career-high three touchdown catches. Metcalf has 12 TD catches this season, also a career best. It was the fifth 50-point game in franchise history and first since 2012 when Seattle beat Buffalo 50-17 in a game played in Toronto. Arizona Cardinals 25-22 Dallas Cowboys Kyler Murray threw two touchdown passes to Antoine Wesley and the Arizona Cardinals held on to beat the Dallas Cowboys 25-22 in a matchup of playoff-bound teams Sunday. The outcome didn’t do much to change the races for the NFC’s No. 1 seed or the NFC West, but the Cardinals ended a three-game skid a week after backing into the postseason while stopping the NFC East champion’s four-game winning streak. Murray improved to 8-0 as a starter at the home of the Cowboys. Most of those victories were as a Texas high school playoff star, but the past two have been as a pro after last season’s 38-10 rout. The Cardinals (11-5) are still a game behind the Los Angeles Rams in their division with LA rallying to beat Baltimore 20-19. Denver Broncos 13-34 Los Angeles Chargers Justin Herbert threw for two touchdowns and set the franchise single-season record, Andre Roberts returned a kick 101 yards for a score, and the Los Angeles Chargers moved back into an AFC playoff spot with a 34-13 victory over the Denver Broncos on Sunday. Los Angeles (9-7) are in the final wild-card spot but need a win at Las Vegas next week to wrap up their first postseason berth since 2018. The Colts, Chargers and Raiders all have the same record, but the Chargers currently hold the tiebreaker over Las Vegas after their 28-14 victory on 4 October. Denver (7-9) have lost four of its last five, was eliminated from playoff contention and is assured of its fifth straight losing season. Herbert, the AFC starter for the Pro Bowl, has 35 touchdown passes this season, surpassing Philip Rivers’ 2008 mark of 34. Herbert tied it with 14 seconds remaining in the first half on an 8-yard throw to Keenan Allen to give the Bolts a 17-0 lead. He set the mark early in the fourth quarter on a 45-yard TD to Mike Williams, which put the Chargers up 34-6. Herbert completed 22 of 31 passes for 237 yards. He became the fastest player to reach 800 career completions (31 games) and at 23 years, 298 days is the second-youngest player in league history to get to 65 TD passes Carolina Panthers 10-18 New Orleans Saints Alvin Kamara turned a short pass into New Orleans’ first touchdown in more than 11 quarters, Brett Maher kicked four field goals, and the Saints beat the reeling Carolina Panthers 18-10 on Sunday. The third victory in four games for the Saints (8-8) – just their second triumph in the Superdome in their regular-season home finale – assured New Orleans would head into the final week of the regular season still in the hunt for an NFC wild-card spot. Taysom Hill completed 17 of 28 passes for 222 yards and also led the Saints in rushing with 45 yards while playing behind an offensive line missing four season-opening starters. Marquez Callaway caught six passes for 97 yards and Kamara had five catches for 68 yards, including his 12-yard TD in the fourth quarter. New Orleans’ defense did the rest, sacking Sam Darnold seven times. Cameron Jordan had 3 1/2 sacks, his third straight game with at least two. CJ Gardner Johnson sealed it with an interception in the final minute, dooming the Panthers (5-11) to a sixth straight loss. New Orleans finished the game with Hill triumphantly taking a knee as fans belted out chants of, “Who-dat say they gonna’ beat them Saints!” Darnold, who resumed the starting role he held earlier this season after Cam Newton had started in Carolina’s previous five losses, completed 17 of 26 passes for 132 yards. Minnesota Vikings 10-37 Green Bay Packers Aaron Rodgers threw two touchdown passes, AJ Dillon ran for two more scores and the Green Bay Packers routed the Minnesota Vikings 37-10 on Sunday night to wrap up the NFC’s No 1 playoff seed. Green Bay’s victory, coupled with Philadelphia’s 20-16 triumph at Washington earlier in the day, dropped the Vikings (7-9) from postseason contention and gave the Eagles a playoff berth. The Vikings were playing without quarterback Kirk Cousins after he was placed on the reserve/Covid-19 list Friday. The Packers (13-3) are the lone NFL team with an unbeaten home record and have a chance to reach the Super Bowl without leaving Lambeau Field. Sunday night’s game exemplified the potential advantage the Packers have playing home games in January, as the temperature was 11 degrees with a wind chill of 1F just before kickoff. Green Bay have won 13 straight regular-season home games, but lost 31-26 at home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in last season’s NFC championship game. The Packers haven’t reached the Super Bowl since their 2010 title and have lost in the conference championship game four of the last seven seasons. Rodgers went 29 of 38 for 288 yards with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Allen Lazard and an 11-yarder to Davante Adams, who had 11 catches for 136 yards. Adams has 117 receptions to break the Packers’ season record he set last year.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/nfl-week-17-scores
5903;5903;Fossil hunter Richard Leakey who showed humans evolved in Africa dies at 77;2022-01-02T21:47:51Z;['N/A'];['Fossils', 'Conservation', 'Kenya', 'Africa', 'World news', 'Archaeology', 'Evolution', 'Science', 'Palaeontology'];"The celebrated Kenyan conservationist and fossil hunter Richard Leakey, whose groundbreaking discoveries helped prove that humankind evolved in Africa, has died aged 77. The president of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, announced Leakey’s death with “deep sorrow”. The famed palaeoanthropologist had remained energetic into his 70s, despite bouts of skin cancer and kidney and liver disease. Posting on Twitter, the Leakey Foundation wrote of its “deep sadness” at his death, adding: “He was a visionary whose great contributions to human origins and wildlife conservation will never be forgotten.” Leakey was born in Nairobi on 19 December 1944 – and it was perhaps inevitable that he would become a fossil hunter given his parents were Louis and Mary Leakey, perhaps the world’s most famous discoverers of ancestral hominids.
Although Leakey initially tried his hand at safari guiding, aged 23 – and with having no formal archaeological training – he won a research grant to dig on the shores of northern Kenya’s Lake Turkana. During the 1970s he led expeditions that shed new light on the scientific understanding of human evolution, with the discovery of the skulls of Homo habilis (1.9m years old) in 1972 and Homo erectus (1.6m years old) in 1975. He made the cover of Time magazine posing with a Homo habilis mock-up, under the headline How Man Became Man. But it was in 1981, when he fronted the landmark seven-part BBC TV series The Making of Mankind, that he gained wider fame. Just a few years later, in 1984, he would enjoy his most famous fossil find: the uncovering of a near-complete Homo erectus skeleton during one of his digs. Nicknamed Turkana Boy, it dated from approximately 1.5m years ago and is the most complete fossil skeleton of a human ancestor ever found. During this decade Leakey became one of the world’s leading voices against the then legal global ivory trade. In 1989 the Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi appointed him to lead the national wildlife agency, which became the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS). Softly spoken and seemingly devoid of personal vanity, Leakey’s campaigning methods could nevertheless be eye-catching. He masterminded a spectacular publicity stunt of burning a pyre of ivory by setting fire to 12 tonnes of tusks – making the point that once removed from elephants they had no value. He also held his nerve when implementing a shoot-to-kill order against armed poachers. Leakey’s illustrious career, however, was beset with health challenges. In 1969 he was diagnosed with terminal kidney disease. Ten years later and seriously ill he received a kidney transplant from his brother, Philip, and recovered to full health. Then in 1993 his small Cessna plane crashed in the Rift Valley. He survived but lost both legs. Sabotage was suspected but never proved. He told the Financial Times that he endured “regular threats” and lived with armed guards, adding: “But I made the decision not to be a dramatist and say: ‘They tried to kill me.’ I chose to get on with life.” Leakey was eventually forced out of KWS and began a career as a prominent opposition politician, joining the voices against Moi’s corrupt regime. His political career met with less success, and in 1998 he was appointed by Moi to head Kenya’s civil service in charge of fighting official corruption. The task proved impossible, however, and he resigned after just two years. In 2015, as another elephant-poaching crisis gripped Africa, Kenyatta invited Leakey back to KWS, this time as chairman of the board, a position he would hold for three years. Dr Paula Kahumbu, the head of Wildlife Direct, a conservation group founded by Leakey, paid tribute on Twitter, saying: “Richard was a very good friend and a true loyal Kenyan. May he Rest In Peace.”";https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/02/fossil-hunter-richard-leakey-who-showed-humans-evolved-in-africa-dies-at-77
5905;5905;Thomas Tuchel refuses to guarantee Lukaku return to Chelsea team;2022-01-02T20:39:53Z;['Jacob Steinberg'];['Chelsea', 'Thomas Tuchel', 'Romelu Lukaku', 'Liverpool', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Thomas Tuchel refused to guarantee that Romelu Lukaku will be given his place back after the striker was dropped for Chelsea’s 2-2 draw with Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Chelsea host Tottenham in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday and Tuchel will decide whether to bring Lukaku back into the fold only after holding further talks with him on Monday. The manager was left fuming after the £97.5m forward went public with his unhappiness at Stamford Bridge in an unauthorised interview last week and he hinted that he could leave the Belgian out again against Spurs.
“He’s our player, he will stay our player, we will always protect our player,” Tuchel said. “First we need to evaluate the situations, not listen to media or pressure, understand what he said and why he said it. “Then we will take the decision if he is good to go for Wednesday. I cannot tell you right now because we need to talk and understand the situation more and on we go. Once the situation is clear he will stay our player and we protect our player.” Lukaku had caused a storm by questioning Tuchel’s system and saying he wants to return to Internazionale one day. The comments went down badly at Chelsea and it is understood Tuchel, who held talks with senior players before picking his team, had the backing of the dressing room after omitting the club’s record signing. “I don’t take decisions in my office,” Tuchel said. “I have players to listen to and hear their opinions about what they think and I make my decisions once I hear them out. It’s their club and their team. It’s not a personal thing for me.”
Tuchel, who would not say what he wants from the meeting on Monday, was asked if he had intended to make a stand against Lukaku’s behaviour. “It’s not Chelsea like but it’s also not the worst thing in the world,” he said. “I don’t feel personally attacked. On Saturday new statements appeared and it got too big, too much noise, and we lost the focus of the match. “We wanted to protect Romelu from a rash decision because we need to speak with him, read the full interview and stay calm. It was simply the decision to protect the match like this. It was too much noise. This was clear that he will not be in the squad.” The result dealt a major blow to Chelsea’s and Liverpool’s hopes of catching Manchester City. Liverpool appeared to have revived their title prospects after goals from Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah put them 2-0 up but Chelsea levelled through Mateo Kovacic and Christian Pulisic before the break.
Chelsea were aggrieved that Mané was still on the pitch to score the opener after the Liverpool forward escaped with a booking for an elbow on César Azpilicueta in the first minute. “It’s a clear red,” Azpilicueta said. “I don’t care if it’s five seconds into the game – he doesn’t look for the ball, he just wants to hit me with the elbow. I don’t understand. We are getting a lot of decisions against us.” City are 10 points above Chelsea and 11 clear of Liverpool, who have a game in hand. However Pep Lijnders, who stood in for Jürgen Klopp after Liverpool’s manager tested positive for Covid-19, refused to admit that the race is over. “We never look at others,” Klopp’s assistant said. “The title race is only decided on the last match. We have to focus on ourselves. That’s how we always did it. We only focus on the next game. This is how we became champions and won the Champions League.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/thomas-tuchel-refuses-to-guarantee-lukaku-return-to-chelsea-team
5906;5906;Twitter permanently suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene’s personal account ;2022-01-02T20:28:32Z;['Martin Pengelly'];['Republicans', 'The far right', 'US news', 'US politics', 'Coronavirus', 'Vaccines and immunisation'];"The personal Twitter account of the Georgia Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has been permanently suspended, for violating policies on Covid misinformation.
The action against Greene on Sunday came under the “strike” system Twitter launched last March, which uses artificial intelligence to identify posts about the coronavirus misleading enough to cause harm. Two or three strikes earn a 12-hour account lock, four strikes prompt a weeklong suspension and five or more can get an account permanently removed. Twitter had previously suspended Greene’s account for periods ranging from 12 hours to a week. She was issued a “fourth strike” this summer, for saying vaccines were failing. “We’ve been clear that … we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” a Twitter spokeswoman said on Sunday. The congresswoman’s official account remains active. The Republican is a determined controversialist and extremist who courts controversy and confrontation. On social media, she has voiced support for racist views, QAnon conspiracy theories such as the lie that the 2020 election was stolen, and calls for violence against Democrats including the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Last February, the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, called Greene’s embrace of conspiracy theories and “loony lies” a “cancer for the Republican party”. The Democratic-led House ejected her from committee assignments. In July, Twitter suspended Greene for a week after Joe Biden urged tech companies to take stronger action against bogus vaccine claims that the president said were “killing people”. Twitter has said it has removed thousands of tweets and challenged millions of accounts. Greene has regularly been fined for refusing to follow Covid guidelines in Congress, including mask-wearing on the House floor. In a statement on the Telegram app on Sunday, she called Twitter “an enemy to America” and said it could not “handle the truth”. She also accused Twitter of seeking “a communist revolution” and said: “Social media platforms can’t stop the truth from being spread far and wide. Big tech can’t stop the truth. Communist Democrats can’t stop the truth. I stand with the truth and the people. We will overcome.” Greene said her account was suspended after she tweeted statistics from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a government database which includes raw data. Among Greene’s final tweets was one that falsely referenced “extremely high amounts of Covid vaccine deaths”, according to her Telegram account, which appears to mirror her now-banned Twitter feed. More than 825,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US, out of a caseload of nearly 55m. Many states are experiencing a surge of cases and disruption to everyday life caused by the highly infectious Omicron variant. On Sunday, Biden’s top medical adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, said the US had been seeing almost a “vertical increase” of cases, now averaging 400,000 a day, with hospitalisations up too. Resistance to vaccinations and other public health measures has driven the pandemic and inflamed political tensions. Last week, Greene boasted on Twitter about talking to Donald Trump by phone. She said she had received the former president’s permission to clarify his stance that he is against vaccine mandates though he encourages people to get the shot and booster. Trump was booed by some audience members in Dallas on 19 December, when he said he had received a booster shot.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter-permanently-suspends-account
5907;5907;Glorious chaos at Stamford Bridge shows City are too good for the rest | Barney Ronay;2022-01-02T20:22:26Z;['Barney Ronay'];['Chelsea', 'Liverpool', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Well, there goes the league title. Happy new year everyone! But hey, what a way to go. For the second time in two-and-a-half weeks Liverpool came to London and played out a wild, impossibly moreish 2-2 draw against occasionally brilliant, occasionally flawed opponents. This was no doubt an agonising watch for Jürgen Klopp in self‑isolation; just as it was 90 minutes of full-body torture for Thomas Tuchel, who spent the afternoon leaping up like a furious clockwork woodpecker, combination-punching invisible demons, and at one point hurling a bottle of orange energy drink thrillingly into an advertisement hoarding.
For Liverpool a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge follows the 2-2 draw at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. And so the ledger will report four points dropped: the kind of matches where title races are lost, seasons bookended. And yet it didn’t feel like a day for regrets. A five-month extended victory lap for the reigning champions presents a problem for the Premier League and its broadcast partners. It might well reopen the question of exactly how City have managed to build this extraordinary position of strength, a squad with no weaknesses. Some will point to questions the Premier League feel have yet to be answered over resources and expenditure, questions that are designed, at bottom, to preserve competitiveness. City’s fans might reply by rolling their eyes and pointing to Chelsea’s own absent £100m striker. One thing is clear. Flawed teams produce brilliant games. Those spaces, the mis-steps, it’s where the oxygen gets in. And this was a game where amazing things just kept happening. On 56 minutes Liverpool’s defence cleared a corner high into the night sky, Diogo Jota took the ball as it bounced, scrabbled back to his feet under pressure, and laid the bail off to Mohamed Salah. From 35 yards Salah produced something hilariously good, a driven chip-shot that drew, in turn, an outstanding stretching leaping save from Édouard Mendy. In that moment this didn’t feel like a football match, more a kind of display, a trick-shot bonus feature, Evel Knievel leaping a row of municipal buses. In reality the idea that this match represented a title-race eliminator was always fanciful. Chelsea haven’t looked like contenders since the start of November. Liverpool had won six of their last eight, but will now be losing their first-choice attackers. And in the end, it’s not you: it’s them. It’s the unwavering excellence of Manchester City, a team that continue to make something very difficult look very easy indeed.
Stamford Bridge was a noisy, gusty place at kick-off. With Romelu Lukaku at home watching Real Madrid, Thomas Tuchel went with that infamous “other system” also known as the shape that won Chelsea the Champions League: seven primarily defensive players, plus three in attack to press and cover. The early exchanges were hilariously error-prone, culminating in Trevoh Chalobah stooping to head clear Diogo Jota’s pass and ending up with his nose grazing the turf, somehow, in defiance of all physical laws, heading the ball off his own shoelaces. The ball broke to Sadio Mané. He buried it.
If anything captures Liverpool’s edge of brittleness and brilliance it is the interaction between Trent Alexander-Arnold and Salah, arguably the outstanding single attacking combination in English football over the past decade. It was from there that Liverpool made it 2-0 with a startling moment of synchronised movement and passing physics. Salah started the move, funnelling the ball back to Alexander-Arnold. As Chelsea’s defenders slackened a little, Salah had already begun to sprint, sniffing out a sliver of space, a fault in the stitching. Alexander-Arnold released a wonderfully weighted, backspun pass straight into that same corridor. At which point Salah produced another perfect little miniature. His first touch stunned the ball into his stride. The second wasn’t a touch at all, but a feint, an opening of the hips that transformed Marcos Alonso into a kind of goal-doorman, dipping a knee, scrolling his hand, formally inviting Salah into the Chelsea six-yard box. The finish was effortless, a lifted dink-prod on the run. Mateo Kovacic pulled one back with another stunner. Everyone who has ever kicked a ball has caught one like this just the once – leaning back, adjusting his feet, punting it up and then back down in a perfect parabola to clank in off the far post. But not, perhaps, in a brutally tight Premier League game in front of the watching millions, with just one shot, one moment to catch the sun. Chelsea’s equaliser moments later came down that same Liverpool right flank. Frankly, it all seemed a little too easy. Salah lost possession. Alexander‑Arnold was caught dawdling in a half space. N’Golo Kanté was able to help the ball on for Christian Pulisic who conjured a fine finish of his own, arcing the ball over Caoimhin Kelleher with a perfectly lobbed instep touch.
And the fact is neither of these teams is at the level of City, whose football has a kind of light around it right now, something clean and perfectly ordered, who have won 11 games in a row by passing and moving their opponents into a state of exhausted impotence. It would be absurd to denigrate a team this good for being, in effect too good, for winning games in a way that is so beautifully planned and drilled it seems to creep ever closer to a place where variables are removed and the result is, in effect, inevitable. City are a thing of beauty, too. And on the ragged, thrilling evidence of Stamford Bridge, just too good for the rest.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/02/glorious-chaos-at-stamford-bridge-shows-city-are-too-good-for-the-rest
5908;5908;Sports stars can no longer plead ignorance. They have political power and must use it | Philipp Lahm;2022-01-02T20:00:26Z;['Philipp Lahm'];['Sport politics', 'Sport', 'Tennis', 'World Cup 2022', 'Football', 'World Cup', 'Peng Shuai'];"Sport is politics. There is no question about that at the beginning of the year when the Winter Olympics are taking place in Beijing and the World Cup in Qatar. You only have to open the newspaper these days. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the Guardian, the Polish Gazeta Wyborcza and other quality media, which gather many voices to report on the world, deal on their sports pages with the diplomatic boycott of the Olympics by the USA, Great Britain and other countries, the “quiet diplomacy” of the International Olympic Committee and workers’ rights in Qatar. One news item received particular attention worldwide. Out of concern for the life of Peng Shuai, the former world No 1 in doubles, the WTA has suspended all tournaments in China. In total, about 30% of the WTA’s revenue comes from China, with the annual finals in Shenzhen paying out the equivalent of about €12m (£10m), more than any other event in women’s tennis. But the players are now saying: we’ll do without.
Taking a strong stance is a tradition in women’s tennis, whose history is marked by personalities. In the 1960s, the WTA founder and multiple grand slam winner Billie Jean King campaigned for equal treatment and pay for the genders. Later, the multiple Wimbledon winner Martina Navratilova campaigned for gay rights. The supposedly weaker sex actually dominates the fighting mode. Female athletes have turned their federation into an independent institution. The WTA’s consistent decisions send a signal: you can say no in sport. Negotiations require an interplay – approaching each other, but also withdrawing from time to time. Countries in which human rights are not universal also invest in football. These countries are part of global sport and offer so much money that many find it difficult to refuse. The German television broadcaster ZDF recently ran a hidden-camera investigation. The reporter spoke to workers from Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh who build stadiums and roads in Qatar. Eight of them lived in one room; they earn €300 a month each but have been waiting months for their salaries. The report also featured attractive match scenes from the 2021 Arab Cup and all eight new stadiums. In a country with 2.9 million inhabitants there are now eight of the most modern, expensive and beautiful stadiums in the world, less than an hour’s drive apart. The ZDF report was in anticipation of the dilemma facing the 2022 World Cup: people know about the situation in Qatar but they enjoy watching the spectacular pictures and the best teams. When the 1978 World Cup took place under the direction of the Argentinian military regime, many players had no answer to questions about human rights. Today, the world can no longer be viewed so naively. Everyone involved knows better than before about what is going on in faraway continents. Most footballers also have more time to deal with such issues, due to advanced professionalisation. Public figures like them are also expected to inform themselves of matters outside their bubble. Now that the world has become a village, everyone knows the conditions in Qatar.
Some footballers are stepping in and calling for human rights to be respected. “I think more attention needs to be paid to this kind of thing in the future when awarding contracts,” the Germany international Leon Goretzka has said. Finland’s captain, Tim Sparv, wrote in an open letter: “We woke up too late, I woke up too late.” Sparv called on players, media and fans to talk about working conditions in Qatar. On a small scale, this argument is already bearing fruit. When a black player was racially insulted by a spectator during the third division match between MSV Duisburg and VfL Osnabrück in Germany in December, the teams forced a stop. All parties quickly agreed that they wanted to set an example: players, both clubs, referees, the association and fans from both camps. The individual is not powerless; people can make a difference. Small is where you start, big is where it can end. Greta Thunberg was 15 when she stood alone on a street in Stockholm to draw attention to climate change. Many joined in, and Fridays for Future has since put the environment on the global agenda. This has changed politics. Football too: the 2024 European Championship in Germany can be judged a success only if it takes ecological aspects into account. Our preparations are under way.
I consider myself lucky to have been born into a democracy. It was not long ago that the conditions in my home country were different. Three decades ago Germany was divided, the eastern part a dictatorship. Other nations in Europe were also going through a change. The 1964 European Championship took place in a fascist state, and Spain’s team won its home tournament in front of General Franco. He was still in power when the 1982 World Cup was awarded to Spain. By the time it took place, Spain was a democracy. Major sporting events, especially in football, generate enormous attention. Nowadays, European Championships and World Cups require everyone who takes part to deal with working conditions and human rights. At Euro 2024 in Germany, too, Europe will negotiate with each other how we want to live together. • Philipp Lahm’s column appears regularly in the Guardian.

5911;5911;Tom Woolstencroft and Maro Itoje help Saracens break Northampton’s spirit;2022-01-02T19:41:22Z;['Gerard Meagher'];['Premiership', 'Northampton', 'Saracens', 'Rugby union', 'Sport'];"“Same old Sarries, always cheating,” came the chant from a Northampton supporter in the crowd. It is unclear whether he was moaning about the legality of some of their defensive work or perhaps making reference to how their salary-cap scandal has been referenced a lot of late, but he got one thing spot-on: this was without question the same old Saracens. The Northampton director of rugby, Chris Boyd, bristled at the idea that a win such as this for Saracens was inevitable when Northampton found themselves camped in their opponents’ 22 for large spells of the first half, only to go in at the interval at 6-6. We have seen it so many times before, however, that there was little surprising about the manner in which Saracens weathered the storm and, with Alex Lozowski finishing with 20 points, pulled clear.
This sort of performance, particularly on their travels, has been the hallmark of Saracens’ return to the Premiership. They have the defensive resilience to soak up prolonged periods of pressure before edging in front and delivering the telling blow as their opponents get increasingly desperate. Here it was Lozowski’s try early in the second half and Tom Woolstencroft’s score from a driving maul that ensured victory for Saracens – Maro Itoje’s late effort making for a thoroughly demoralising afternoon for Northampton. It might have been different had Northampton managed to convert one of their chances in the first half – Boyd was adamant that repeatedly opting against kicking at goal was the right approach – and their supporters certainly felt that the referee Adam Leal ought to have shown a yellow card following a flurry of Saracens penalties. He did not, however, and after Northampton again opted for a scrum under the posts he penalised the home side – much to Boyd’s frustration. Boyd said: “He didn’t have enough nuts, did he? I mean it was a clear hinge. There was only one side under pressure in that series of scrums. At the end of the day we only got six points and they got 30. We had half a dozen opportunities in the first half, they had three and scored three tries. That’s the difference between the two sides.”
Northampton can regroup, at least safe in the knowledge they are not the only side to suffer this kind of defeat against Saracens. Bristol were also kept tryless at home in September but they probably ought to have played the conditions better. They were not without positives – George Furbank was excellent at full‑back – but just as was the case last time out against Harlequins at Twickenham, a touch more pragmatism could make all the difference when the heavens open. Saracens, meanwhile, have cemented their grip on second spot. Jamie George made a successful return to the side from a knee injury – perhaps his most valuable asset was the manner in which he communicated with Leal when his side were under the pump – and Alex Goode again showed his class at fly‑half, standing in for the injured Owen Farrell, who was in the coaches’ box, barking out instructions to his side. In a further boost for club and country the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, revealed Farrell could make his comeback on 23 January, two weeks before England’s Six Nations opener. Lozowski and Dan Biggar traded a pair of penalties in a first half notable for Northampton’s ambition despite the torrential rain and Saracens’ ability to hold firm in the trenches. Furbank in particular was a threat with the ball in hand, but Saracens were resilient with their backs to the wall. Given Saracens reached double figures in penalties against inside the first half, however, maybe Northampton’s grievances were not without foundation.
Saracens then struck with the first try four minutes after the restart. Goode was the architect, straightening through half a gap before offloading to Lozowski, who slid for the line early and had just enough momentum to get there. He converted for good measure for a seven-point lead. There was no little endeavour from Northampton but as the half wore on there was increasingly an inevitability to the Woolstencroft try that broke Saints’ spirit. It occurred moments after the Saints replacement Conor Carey had been sent to the sin-bin and before Itoje splashed over for good measure. “When you’re under the pump, in front of a great crowd as Northampton have, in your 22 as often as we were you need your senior players to step up and I thought across the board ours did,” McCall said. “I thought we showed a lot of fight, grit and resolve. Just a really good hard-fought away win.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/northampton-saracens-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
5912;5912;As I bum-shuffled my way down the scree at Avalanche Peak I wished I was back in the bush | Rose Lu;2022-01-02T19:00:25Z;['N/A'];['New Zealand', 'Asia Pacific', 'Mountains', 'Environment', 'Trees and forests', 'Walking', 'National parks'];"Nothing beats the New Zealand bush. The writer Ashleigh Young once tweeted: “Sometimes NZ writers say ‘the forest’ instead of ‘the bush’ (and they definitely mean ‘the bush’) because they are nervous about saying ‘the bush’. Bring back the bush. If everyone does it, we will be fine.” So here I am, proclaiming, “I love the bush!” Perhaps this is my opinion as an outdoor enthusiast and bisexual, but “bush” is the more accurate descriptor for the native flora of Aotearoa. Our bush is dense and scratchy, inured to the trample of boots. Our bush is thick and lush all year round, as few native plant species are deciduous. Our bush is not some wan forest: it is wild and overgrown, it does not encourage easy passage.
As my family were neither middle class nor Pākehā (white European), I didn’t venture into the bush until I was an adult. It’s now been 10 years since my first foray into the bush but I’ll never forget that first experience. A friend, who grew up with the bush, convinced me to come on a two-day tramp. I had no idea what I was getting into. Surely a tramp was just a long walk. How difficult could a walk in the bush possibly be? I lacked outdoor gear but my friend sorted me with her spares, save for tramping boots as our feet were not the same size. “Maybe I’ll get into tramping,” I decided, buying the cheapest pair of boots I could find. The route was up Avalanche Peak, the only poled summit in Arthur’s Pass, a national park famous for its bush of silver, red and mountain tawhai (beech) trees. I did not appreciate the bush on the way up. Instead, I cursed the 1,100m ascent that left my lungs burning and back saturated with sweat. I envied my friend’s fitness that allowed her to walk ahead and find features of the bush to show me: the peat floor carpeted with prickly shield fern, the sponge moss and lace lichen, and the understorey of snow totara, bearing edible cashew apple-shaped berries.
I thought the uphill would be the hardest part but then I discovered what happens once you leave the bush. Past the bushline, the tall trees were replaced by stout, hardy shrubs. Some people refer to this as alpine scrub but I think you could equally call it alpine bush. This alpine bush featured plants I had never seen before, like the Mount Cook lily, with bristly white petals and leaves as tough as leather. This bush was patchy and uneven to walk on, and somehow I was as slow on the flat as I was uphill. Soon, the alpine bush too disappeared, and the only vegetation was the moss and lichen that grew on the rock and shingle we crunched underfoot. My friend pointed out a fan of broken rock, ranging from palm-sized to head-sized, that dropped down into an open plain. We had to get down that scree slope to get to our accommodation for the night. There’s an art to running down scree slopes, which my friend demonstrated, where one “surfs” along the surface of the debris. She pulled away like a motor boat from a jetty, generating a clattering wave of cascading rock, leaving me to tread cautiously in her wake. I tried to replicate her movements but I fell repeatedly until I gave up. I sat on my bum and thought back to earlier in the day. I never fell in the bush. The bush was sheltered, the bush was safe. I wished I was back in the bush. I ended up bum-shuffling my way down the slope, tearing up the seat of my cotton shorts in the process.
Thankfully that first trip didn’t put me off tramping and since then I’ve visited bush all around the country. There’s the bush of Kahurangi national park, which looks blue from a distance, and the goblin forests of Taranaki, named for the gnarled trees and the mosses that hang off them. I can now enjoy the cool, crisp air of the bush around me and look forward to where it may take me. Rose Lu is a writer, software developer and cable car owner from Wellington.

5913;5913;Combine classes in case of Covid staff shortages, DfE tells teachers in England;2022-01-02T18:56:59Z;['Richard Adams', 'Andrew Sparrow'];['Schools', 'Omicron variant', 'Universities', 'Colleges', 'Students', 'Coronavirus', 'Further education', 'Higher education', 'Department for Education', 'Education policy', 'Education', 'England', 'Trade unions', 'Infectious diseases', 'UK news'];"Ministers have told headteachers in England to start preparing for staff shortages by using support staff to fill in gaps, combining classes or using hybrid learning, with some classes taught remotely and some face-to-face. In an email sent to schools on Sunday, the Department for Education (DfE) advised them to deal with staff shortages by combining classes into larger groups. The email said: “You may wish to use existing teaching, temporary and support staff more flexibly where required to ensure your setting remains open, while ensuring that you continue to have appropriate support in place for pupils with [special education needs and disabilities]. “As pupils do not need to be kept in consistent groups, you may wish to consider combining classes.”
The new advice came as the government announced that 137,583 new Covid cases had been recorded in England and Wales. That is the lowest daily figure since 27 December, when figures may also have been depressed by the festivities, but the total number of new cases over the past seven days is still up 43.1% on the previous week. Ministers have not yet ruled out introducing further Covid restrictions for England, but the health minister Edward Argar said on Sunday that he was seeing “nothing at the moment in the data” to suggest they would be needed. Nadhim Zahawi told school leaders in an open letter posted on Sunday that staff absences would be a “possible challenge” in keeping students in classrooms. The education secretary said: “If operational challenges caused by workforce shortages in your setting make delivery of face-to-face teaching impossible, I would encourage you to consider ways to implement a flexible approach to learning. “Flexible delivery involves utilising all your available teaching and non-teaching workforce to maximise on-site education for as many pupils as possible while you flexibly deliver provision either on-site or remotely to some pupils,” Zahawi said.
In a Twitter thread addressed to a wider audience, Zahawi said face-to-face teaching would “continue to be the expected norm” in the new term, which will start for many pupils on Tuesday. He particularly praised former teachers who have agreed to fill vacancies this term, saying: “It’s this Blitz spirit that will be essential in turning the tide on Covid.” Zahawi sought to reassure parents after Labour and unions said last-minute moves to tackle the spread of the Omicron Covid variant in schools, colleges and universities in England would not be enough to avoid disruption or stop large-scale absences among staff and students. The DfE announced that masks should be worn indoors in education settings in England, including in classrooms, libraries and corridors, from the start of the new term until the end of January.
It also said it had ordered 7,000 air purification units for nurseries, schools and colleges, “for areas where quick fixes to improve ventilation are not possible, such as being able to open a window”. But the units will not be delivered until next month. For a classroom to qualify for a government air purifier, the DfE says it must show a “sustained” CO2 reading of 1,500 particles per million or higher for a week when occupied, as well as requiring building work to improve its ventilation. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said 7,000 units were “nowhere near enough” because they would only cover around one in four schools in England. “I’m afraid it looks a little bit like a rushed last-minute announcement to give the appearance of doing something on a big issue where they should have taken action a lot sooner,” he said. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows children have been among the most likely to be infected, with one in 15 children aged two to Year 6, and one in 20 for Years 7-11, testing positive for Covid for the week ending 23 December in England. The joint general secretary of the National Education Union, Mary Bousted, said the order of 7,000 purifiers would be “completely inadequate” for providing clean air. “The fact that the government have provided the extra purifiers shows that it recognises the problem but with over 300,000 classrooms in England they have failed to provide an effective solution,” Bousted said.
Ofsted, the schools inspectorate for England, will not inspect secondary schools or colleges in the first week of term. Current school leaders who also act as Ofsted inspectors will not be asked to carry out inspections, while schools affected by Covid staff absences should request deferrals of inspection visits. The DfE said the mask advice for students in year 7 and above would remain until 26 January, when it would be reviewed alongside other mitigation measures. The advice also applies to further and higher education providers such as colleges and universities. The Conservative chair of the Commons education committee, Robert Halfon, told Times Radio he was worried that mask-wearing would have a negative effect on pupils. “The children’s minister came to my committee and said there was very limited evidence as to the efficacy of masks in educational settings,” he said. “Jonathan Van-Tam, hugely respected, the deputy chief medical officer, said that they could be quite inhibitory to the natural expressions of learning in children, the national Children’s Deaf Society has tweeted out their big reservations about mask policy, and what I worry about is the effect that masks have on children’s wellbeing, mental health and anxiety.” Bousted, however, disagreed. She said secondary school pupils in Scotland and Wales had been wearing masks in class without that causing problems. “Even in secondary only just under half the pupils have been vaccinated. And we know that mask-wearing does have an effect of suppressing transmission,” she said. In a sign of lessons heeded from the tragic case of the murdered six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, the DfE has updated its list of “vulnerable” children to be given priority for face-to-face teaching in the event of school or nursery closures. The list now includes children who have been known to social care services because of “domestic abuse, parental offending, adult mental health issues, and drug and alcohol addiction”.";https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/02/moves-to-tackle-omicron-in-english-schools-not-enough-unions-warn
5914;5914;Chelsea and Liverpool trade blows in thrilling draw but City the real winners;2022-01-02T18:55:58Z;['David Hytner'];['Premier League', 'Chelsea', 'Liverpool', 'Football', 'Sport'];"It had been tempting to fixate on Thomas Tuchel’s decision to drop Romelu Lukaku from the Chelsea squad after that interview. But it was a measure of what followed during 90 pulsating minutes that the club’s record signing – and all the drama around him – came to feel like a footnote. Tuchel said he did not select Lukaku because his situation had represented too much of a distraction on the eve of the game – what with him saying he was unhappy at the club and questioning the manager’s system. Not for the first time Chelsea coped pretty well without him.
During a thrilling first half they rallied from two goals down, restoring parity through a Mateo Kovacic wonder strike and a tidy finish from Christian Pulisic. When Chelsea can summon this sort of surge, it makes a mockery of their recent Premier League form, which now shows only four wins out of nine. Liverpool played a full part in an entertaining spectacle, their goals coming from Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah; the former snapping a nine-match scoring drought, the latter continuing his red-hot touch. Salah’s goal was the latest gem in his collection and the way that he froze Marcos Alonso with a shake of the hips to open up the chance from a tight angle was one of the game’s many memorable moments. Mané and Salah now depart for the Africa Cup of Nations and so does the Chelsea goalkeeper, Edouard Mendy, who was excellent here – providing further curveballs for their clubs in a season that has been full of them.
The second half did not quite live up to the excitement and tempo of the first, both teams coming to look leggy in the closing stages, even if there were chances at either end and, when the dust had settled, there was one manager who was the happiest of all.
It was not Tuchel or Jürgen Klopp, who did not travel after he tested positive for Covid. It was Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola, who can see a 10‑point lead over Chelsea and 11 over Liverpool, albeit the latter club have a game in hand. The title race is not yet over but it feels increasingly close to it. Liverpool had been undermined by the losses of the Covid positives Alisson, Joel Matip and Roberto Firmino and, if it was strange not to see Klopp on the touchline, it was easy to imagine him charging around back on Merseyside when Mané scored the opening goal. Trevoh Chalobah got himself into a tangle, electing to stoop and head clear when Diogo Jota played the ball forward, even though it was there for the volley, and he succeeded only in ushering in Mané, who sliced inside Mendy and slammed past César Azpilicueta on the line. The big question was whether Mané should have been on the field. He had chased a high ball forward from the opening kick-off, raising his forearm and going into Azpilicueta with it, the Chelsea captain crumpling to the ground. “A clear red,” Azpilicueta said, and Tuchel agreed. What saved Mané was that he did not swing the arm. It was yellow rather than red. Tuchel raged in his technical area. Salah shimmered with menace and he went close in the sixth minute after Chalobah’s loose header to Mané, who ran and crossed. Antonio Rudiger jumped into the saving challenge, sending the ball back towards his own goal, where Mendy saved smartly. Salah’s goal was a beauty, starting with the touch to kill a Trent Alexander-Arnold pass up the right. Once he had seen off Alonso, he opened up his body and a range of options. He chose the whipped shot for the near corner, which was too much for Mendy. Chelsea had started to feel more and more aggrieved with the referee, Anthony Taylor – not a popular figure in these parts – and they needed an important slide tackle from Chalobah to stop the breaking Salah on 36 minutes. At that point the notion that Chelsea would be level at the interval was outlandish. But they got there after Kovacic’s volley from the edge of the area. Caoimhin Kelleher, who deputised impressively for Alisson, punched clear from Alonso’s free‑kick and Kovacic set himself as the ball dropped, placing it with the laces of his right boot up and in off the far post.
Pulisic’s day had begun badly when he blew a gilt-edged one‑on‑one with Kelleher in the seventh minute, after Kai Havertz, who led the line in Lukaku’s absence, charged down an Alexander-Arnold clearance. Pulisic would atone. With Stamford Bridge in a frenzy, Rudiger stepped up to rob Salah and, when N’Golo Kanté helped the ball on, Pulisic once again had only Kelleher to beat. This time he did so and there would still be time before half-time for Mason Mount to stab past the far post for Chelsea.
Liverpool ran through Chelsea on a number of occasions before seeing belatedly raised offside flags and, if Mendy did not get the credit he deserved for saving in those situations, he would do on others. His stop to beat away a Salah lob in the 57th minute was of the highest order and he was alert to deny Mané moments later. Alonso had shot wastefully high after the second-half restart while Chelsea could also point to a close‑range Pulisic effort on the hour from Alonso’s cross that drew a fine save out of Kelleher.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report
5915;5915;Court to unseal deal between Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre;2022-01-02T18:54:45Z;['Robert Booth'];['Prince Andrew', 'Jeffrey Epstein', 'US news', 'UK news', 'Ghislaine Maxwell', 'US crime', 'New York'];A crunch week in Prince Andrew’s fight to avoid a public trial over claims he sexually assaulted a 17-year-old trafficked by the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein begins on Monday, when a New York court unseals a confidential 2009 deal between Epstein and the alleged victim. Lawyers for the Duke of York, who “unequivocally denies” the claims made by Virginia Giuffre, believe her agreement with Epstein could shield him from her civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse in 2001. Epstein, a former friend of the Duke of York, was convicted of sex offences in 2008 and killed himself while in jail in 2019 awaiting trial on further sex trafficking charges. His close associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, 60, also a former friend of Prince Andrew, was last week convicted of sex trafficking in a federal court in New York and faces up to 65 years in prison. After the unsealing of the deal, lawyers for Prince Andrew will argue to Judge Lewis A Kaplan, sitting at the US district court in the southern district of New York in lower Manhattan, that the agreement between Giuffre and Epstein means she cannot take action against their client. Lawyers for Giuffre, known as Virginia Roberts when she claims she was introduced to the prince, have dismissed the attempts to halt the civil case as “just another in a series of tired attempts by Prince Andrew to duck and dodge the legal merits of the case”. But Prince Andrew’s lawyers have told the court that Giuffre is pursuing a “baseless lawsuit against Prince Andrew to achieve another payday at his expense” and that “sensationalism and innuendo have prevailed over the truth”. They claim his “sullied reputation” is collateral damage of the Epstein scandal. At stake is not just Prince Andrew’s future and Giuffre’s pursuit of justice, but the international reputation of the British royal family. Buckingham Palace on Sunday denied as “uninformed speculation” reports that courtiers may have to ask Prince Andrew to stop using his title if he loses the lawsuit brought by Giuffre. It said it would not comment on ongoing legal matters and also played down reports he would have to step back from his role as colonel-in-chief of nine military regiments, units and corps. In other developments, Ghislaine Maxwell’s brother Ian Maxwell, 65, said she maintained her innocence and had no plans to cut a deal with prosecutors to provide evidence against other people who were involved in her and Epstein’s sexual abuse. “Prosecution confirmed no plea bargain offers were made or received” before the trial, he told the Sunday Times. “I expect that position to be maintained.” He also said his sister was not a suicide risk as she awaits sentencing. It also emerged Giuffre could be permitted to deliver a victim impact statement at Maxwell’s sentencing. Sigrid McCawley, a lawyer for Giuffre, told the Daily Telegraph that she anticipates the court will hear from “many, many other women who were not able to be heard at the trial”. And Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, told the Mail on Sunday that there are “four, five, six witnesses” capable of placing Giuffre together with Prince Andrew. The Duke told the BBC in 2019 that he had “no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever”. Prince Andrew’s lawyer, Andrew Brettler, has told the court that Giuffre’s agreement with Epstein provided “a general release of all claims against him and numerous other individuals and entities” and that Prince Andrew is “axiomatically among the releasees”. The same agreement was the basis for Giuffre agreeing to dismiss a battery claim against the lawyer Alan Dershowitz earlier this year, Brettler said. He will also argue that the case should be thrown out because Giuffre, a US citizen, no longer lives in the US. If the judge orders the case to continue, Prince Andrew could ultimately face a trial involving him making a statement under oath. Prince Andrew claimed in a 2019 BBC Newsnight interview that he was at a Pizza Express in Woking on the day in 2001 that Giuffre claims she was with him at the Tramp nightclub. He also addressed her claims that he was sweaty at the nightclub by saying he was incapable of sweating at that time because of an “overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands war”. But asked for evidence of both things by Giuffre’s legal team, his lawyers have as yet put nothing forward, according to court documents.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/02/court-to-unseal-deal-between-jeffrey-epstein-and-virginia-giuffre
5916;5916;‘Generals don’t lead from the back’: New York mayor Eric Adams seeks bold start ;2022-01-02T18:49:09Z;['Richard Luscombe'];['New York', 'US news', 'World news', 'Coronavirus', 'US policing', 'US crime', 'US politics'];"Eric Adams’s first two days in office would resonate with any weary New York commuter: a subway ride featuring a brawl requiring the attendance of police, then the challenge of negotiating Manhattan traffic on a rented bike.
“This is an amazing city,” the new mayor told ABC on Sunday. “You know, riding a city bike in, taking the train in, interacting with New Yorkers: generals don’t lead their troops from the back. “They lead their troops from the front. I’m going to lead my city into this victory from the front. And people tell me this is a difficult job. Darn it, I want it to be a difficult job.” Significant challenges await the newly sworn-in leader of the most populous US city, a Democrat who trounced the Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa in November to become New York’s second Black mayor after David Dinkins, who was in office from 1990 to 1993. “New York can and should be the center of the universe again,” said Adams in an inaugural address themed largely around getting to grips with an Omicron-fueled coronavirus surge that has slowed parts of the city to a crawl. The police and fire departments are reporting sickness rates of around 20% and three subway lines have been suspended because of staff shortages. Adams succeeds as mayor Bill de Blasio, another Democrat who despite becoming hugely unpopular has signalled a run for governor. The city, the new mayor said, had endured “two years of continuous crisis, and that insults our very nature as New Yorkers”. On Saturday, hours after his midnight swearing-in ceremony in Times Square, the 61-year-old rode the subway to work, greeting residents and calling 911 to report a brawl between three men. By the time officers arrived, the fight – witnessed by reporters accompanying the mayor – was over. Adams, a cop himself for 22 years, said he wished police had stuck around longer. On Sunday he was up early again, cycling to City Hall and an appearance on ABC’s This Week in which he called on New Yorkers to get vaccinated and boosted. “It’s going to prevent you from dying,” he said. “It’s going to alleviate the possibility of you being hospitalised and going on a ventilator. “To those who are not vaccinated: ‘Stop it. It’s time to get vaccinated. It’s time to have the booster shots. You’re endangering yourself and you’re endangering the public and your family as well’.” Adams, who is keeping de Blasio’s vaccine mandate for private employers, said consideration of a booster mandate for city employees including cops, firefighters and sanitation workers was “our next move and decision”. His host, George Stephanopoulos, challenged Adams on his campaign pledge to tackle soaring crime rates, especially gun violence. “The balance is not just heavy-handed policing, it’s public safety and justice,” Adams said. “We’re going to go after gangs, we’re going to take down some of the large gangs in our city. We’re going to zero in on gangs. We’re going to reinstitute a plainclothes anti-gun unit and zero in on those guns.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/new-york-city-mayor-eric-adams-seeks-bold-start
5917;5917;Brighton’s Mac Allister doubles up to pile misery on Benítez and Everton;2022-01-02T18:40:36Z;['Andy Hunter'];['Premier League', 'Everton', 'Brighton & Hove Albion', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Everton paraded an expensive recruit before kick-off and Dominic Calvert-Lewin for the first time in four months but any sense of a fresh start for Rafael Benítez was obliterated by Brighton’s maiden victory at Goodison Park. Errors continue to litter Everton performances, from players and manager alike. Graham Potter celebrated a landmark win and hugely rewarding week with unrestrained glee. Two fine goals from Alexis Mac Allister sandwiched a Dan Burn header to give Brighton a richly deserved triumph and seven points from a demanding festive sequence against Everton, Chelsea and Brentford.
Potter’s side squandered leads regularly last season but underlined their progress by withstanding an Anthony Gordon-inspired recovery and sealing victory through Mac Allister’s stunning long‑range strike beyond Jordan Pickford. “It’s a great start to the new year and a great end to a really big week for us,” the Brighton manager said. “Historically this is not a good place for us to come as a club. I thought we played well first half and then the goal we didn’t want changed the atmosphere in the ground. We had to see that out and we did it really well.” Everton had not played for 17 days as a result of three consecutive postponements because of Covid outbreaks. According to Benítez’s programme notes: “We have used the time without matches to prepare as intensively as possible for the challenges Brighton present. This means understanding how to make it difficult for them to impose their style and, equally importantly, knowing how to create the chances to win the game.” His words appeared ludicrous given what unfolded in the first half. Brighton were the more coherent, composed and dangerous side from the outset. They were aided and abetted by dismal defending from an Everton team that created little plus the approach adopted by Benítez himself. The Everton manager started the first home game of the new year with a five-man defence that featured Seamus Coleman at left wing back. The France international left-back Lucas Digne was available but, having been ostracised by Benítez and seen the club purchase Vitaliy Mykolenko for an initial £17.9m from Dynamo Kiev, he was left on the bench throughout. Digne received a warm reception from the Goodison crowd when he sprinted along the touchline in the 40th minute and handed his shirt to a young Evertonian after the final whistle. Benítez said pointedly: “The most important thing for me is to have players on the pitch who want to be there and want to fight for the club.” Potter’s team swept into an early lead when exploiting the gaps that Everton’s shape was designed to eradicate. Joel Veltman picked out Neal Maupay with a cross from the right that the unmarked striker headed over Michael Keane towards Mac Allister. The midfielder, also meeting no resistance as he arrived in the penalty area, placed a volley inside Pickford’s bottom right‑hand corner.
Everton’s defence was found wanting again when Brighton doubled their advantage. Mac Allister turned provider when he drilled a corner to the near post where Enock Mwepu connected with a glancing header. Dan Burn, all alone at the back post having peeled away from Keane, headed home from close range. The hosts were handed a route back into the contest almost immediately when Mwepu was penalised for barging into Gordon just inside the Brighton area. The referee, John Brooks, dismissed Everton appeals for a penalty but changed his mind when directed to the pitch-side monitor by VAR. Calvert-Lewin stepped up to announce his long-awaited return to the team in style but, after a short run-up, blazed the spot-kick over the bar. A first half to forget for Everton ended with a predictable chorus of boos. Benítez’s often-stated belief in a stronger second half to the season is based largely on the availability of Calvert-Lewin. The centre-forward’s physical presence, movement and finishing have been sorely missed since August and he will need time not only to recapture match sharpness but to establish a rapport with those around him. Gordon and Demarai Gray worked tirelessly and were central to Everton’s second‑half improvement, albeit as individuals rather than an effective unit. Gordon brought Everton hope shortly after the restart with his first goal for his boyhood club. Receiving Allan’s pass, the 20-year-old cut inside Marc Cucurella and Mac Allister before unleashing a left-footed drive that deflected off Adam Lallana and sailed beyond a wrong-footed Robert Sánchez.
Gray and Allan both went close to equalising before Brighton re-established their two-goal lead through Mac Allister. Everton appeared to have dealt with a counterattack when Mason Holgate denied Maupay as the forward raced through on goal. But Keane put his team under renewed pressure with a poor clearance straight to Burn. The defender found Leandro Trossard and his low cross was flicked on to Mac Allister by Enock Mwepu. Brighton’s match-winner connected perfectly with the bouncing ball and Pickford was left grasping at thin air as the midfielder’s shot found the top corner from distance. The highly impressive Gordon pulled another goal back when rounding off a flowing move involving Calvert-Lewin and Jonjoe Kenny. Benítez introduced Salomón Rondón – to yet more boos – and, although the substitute created a decent chance for Gordon’s hat‑trick and volleyed over from André Gomes’s cross, there was no reprieve for Everton nor their troubled manager.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/everton-brighton-premier-league-match-report
5918;5918;The Guardian view on the next pandemic: can we learn Covid’s lessons? | Editorial;2022-01-02T18:30:24Z;['Editorial'];['Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Medical research', 'Microbiology', 'Global economy', 'Economics', 'Sars', 'Wildlife', 'Biology', 'Antibiotics'];"Though at times it can feel hard to believe – especially in recent weeks, perhaps – this pandemic will not last for ever. With more than 5 million dead and huge economic and social costs, its toll has been immense, and unnecessarily so. Secrecy in China, complacency in Europe, reckless and callous rightwing populism in the US and Brazil, and the inequity in vaccine distribution have all contributed. Yet if we learn its lessons, we will be better prepared next time. For there will be a next time. Covid is not a once-in-a-century crisis – an idea encouraged by its arrival 101 years after the last major pandemic, the “Spanish” flu, which killed at least 50 million. The mega-flu outbreak that many experts had seen as the next great threat is no less likely to arrive because Covid got here first. A pandemic of similar scale is likely within the next six decades, and could happen at any point in that timespan, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in August; others have put the risk of a comparable crisis within the next decade at around one in four. And as Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert, the creator of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, warned recently: “The next one could be worse. It could be more contagious, or more lethal, or both.” The price we pay then will depend on what we do now, using Covid’s lessons. We have seen international scientific collaboration, incredible dedication by researchers and healthcare staff, and the ability and willingness of local and national communities to pull together. Richer nations will be less likely to take health security for granted. Covid-19 has also shown that the right decisions at the right time can make a profound difference. With a dozen direct flights from Wuhan each week, Taiwan was heavily exposed to risk. But, driven by the experience of the 2002-03 Sars epidemic, it rapidly introduced health screening for arrivals, border controls, effective contact tracing and mask-wearing, and gave its citizens clear and consistent messages. Fewer than 900 of its 22 million-strong population have died. Wishful thinking Yet the global response has too often looked like a triumph of science and a failure of politics. The wishful thinking seen in the first wave has been repeated again and again. And the way we live is increasing the risks of another major pandemic. The aforementioned research published in August in PNAS estimated that the probability of novel disease outbreaks will grow threefold in the next few decades. International trade and travel allow diseases to spread far more quickly. Some scientists argue that we have already entered another great pandemic: a wave of antimicrobial resistance that could see tens of millions die from currently treatable diseases, coming gradually, but ultimately proving far more punishing than the sudden Covid crisis. The overuse of antibiotics to treat humans and livestock is endangering us all. Both the frequency and severity of “spillover” events, where diseases jump from animals to humans, have increased as we encroach on and destroy animal habitats. Zoonotic diseases, transmitted from animals, represent around three-quarters of newly emerging diseases. And research suggests that, as many species become extinct, those that thrive are more likely to be ones known to host pathogens dangerous to humans. Though all this is frequently presented as a developing-world issue, the global north is responsible too. Deforestation is often driven by the cultivation of crops for export. The focus on the perils of “bush meat” and “wet markets” has not been matched by attention to the risks posed by intensive, industrialised farming. Humans will come into even closer contact with nature as global heating reduces available land, and will be pushed into denser habitation and forced to move en masse. Existing diseases such as chikungunya may spread, as warmer temperatures allow their insect carriers to move into new areas. Covid would have been far worse without the pandemic preparations that countries had been making for years, however inadequate they proved. Many of the proposals now are essentially for more (or a better version) of the same, focusing on data collection and analysis, improvements to public health communication and exploratory work that could accelerate the development of vaccines and treatments. Above all, experts warn that there needs to be a massive expansion of surveillance to detect novel pathogens. Prioritising public health An expert panel convened by the G20 has called for a doubling of international financing to tackle major weaknesses in surveillance and other pandemic preparedness requirements, to $15bn a year. The price tag is tiny set beside the cost of Covid, but many fear that even now our leaders are reluctant to spend enough. Specific preparations to fend off or tackle another pandemic could mean everything from better protective gear for abattoir workers to rethinking the ventilation requirements of buildings. But protecting ourselves also requires far more fundamental reassessments. Beyond addressing the climate crisis, it means prioritising public health and acting on what the pandemic has demonstrated so graphically: that inequality – both within and between nations – kills; and it kills mostly, but not solely, the poor. Covid (and especially the Omicron variant) has shown that we cannot isolate ourselves from the physical or economic effects of disease elsewhere. By hogging vaccines and opposing patent waivers, wealthier nations have imperilled their own citizens too. They should think again, and make amends by helping to improve regional manufacturing capacity for tests, vaccines and treatments. Since global solutions are needed, it is positive that the World Health Assembly has agreed that work should begin on a pandemic accord covering prevention, preparedness and response, even if its parameters fall short of the tougher treaty that many hoped for. Finally, we must address questions of trust, and tackle the fissures in our societies – in many ways deepened by Covid. The challenge is truly daunting. But so is the alternative: “What we are going through is also a crisis of meanings,” Elif Shafak has written. “Do we want to go back to the way things were before the pandemic? Was that really normal?” The risk is to our bodily health as well as our wellbeing in the broader sense that Shafak describes. Covid has reminded us that disease is a social as well as a physical phenomenon, produced and shaped by the ways we live. Will we do what is needed to protect ourselves?";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-next-pandemic-can-we-learn-covids-lessons
5919;5919;Liz Truss asked for public money to cover £3,000 lunch;2022-01-02T18:25:50Z;['Rajeev Syal'];['Liz Truss', 'Conservatives', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"Liz Truss, the current favourite to succeed Boris Johnson as leader of the Conservatives among party members, hosted a lunch at an expensive private club owned by a Tory donor after overruling civil service advice to look for a cheaper venue. Leaked correspondence has revealed the foreign secretary “refused to consider anywhere else” and asked that public funds should pay for a £3,000 event with Joe Biden’s trade representative. Civil servants were so concerned at the cost and the venue’s close links to the Tories that the proposal was referred to the most senior official at the Department for International Trade.
According to the correspondence, Truss, then the trade secretary, “explicitly asked that we book 5 Hertford Street”, which is owned by Robin Birley, a £20,000 donor to Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign and the half-brother of Zac Goldsmith, the environment minister. The venue agreed to reduce the bill to £1,400, but on condition of immediate payment – which meant civil servants had to use an emergency process to pay up straight away. The correspondence, disclosed by the Sunday Times, comes as Truss’s supporters conduct a campaign for her to succeed the prime minister should he be toppled by Tory MPs. Truss and her companions drank two measures of dry gin; three bottles of Pazo Barrantes Albariño, a Spanish white wine, costing a total of £153; and two bottles of the French red Coudoulet de Beaucastel, costing a total of £130, it was reported. Before attending the event with US trade representatives, a civil servant described the club as “obviously incredibly expensive and more than I understand we’d usually expect to pay for such a venue”. “[Truss] is hosting [the US trade representataive] Katherine Tai tomorrow for dinner,” an email read. “She wishes to do so in a private dining room. “[Her special adviser] is insisting it takes place at a private members’ club called 5 Hertford Street. She’s recommended this based on having been there before – her argument is that it’s of the appropriate size and standing. “To my knowledge we haven’t hosted anyone there before as a department.” The email, sent on 15 June, said officials had suggested another option, Quo Vadis in Soho, which “costs only £1,000”. This was refused on behalf of Truss, because she was “insisting we book 5 Hertford Street” and Quo Vadis would be “inappropriate”. The email continued: “Something we’ve just discovered is the owner … is Robin Birley, a donor of the PM, Conservative party and Ukip. “I understand the venue hosts party events, which is presumably how [Truss and her special adviser] know it.” Civil servants subsequently entered negotiations with the venue regarding the price, leading to its events manager agreeing to waive hire fees and reduce the overall bill to £1,400 on the agreement it was paid immediately after the meeting. The condition left civil servants having to use an emergency process to sanction the payment. The permanent secretary, John Alty, said he was “content” with the agreement. The disclosure has led to calls for further disclosures over the event. The Department of Trade in November told the Mail on Sunday that the venue was chosen due to availability at short notice, not because Truss had insisted upon it. The lunch was condemned by Labour MPs. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “It is shameful to see Liz Truss pushing against official advice to book a luxury lunch that brings in thousands of pounds of business to a Tory donor. “Without a US trade deal in sight, the sheer incompetence of wasting taxpayer money is truly jarring. Whilst working people see their household budgets squeezed, Conservative ministers always manage to find ways to line their mates’ pockets.” Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, wrote on Twitter that Truss has previously faced questions over her “expensive tastes”, and raised an example of the former international trade secretary’s decision to take three staff members to Vietnam and Singapore in December 2020. Truss was forced to correct a parliamentary question about the south-east Asia trip and disclose that the cost to the taxpayer included £20,296 on flights, £3,980 on accommodation and £4,034 – or £250 a day for each person – on expenses.
Thornberry wrote that this “won’t be the last time Liz Truss gets in trouble asking the taxpayer to foot the bill for her expensive tastes”. “This is about character, and if Truss’s natural instinct is to hide the truth and hope no one asks questions when it comes to small things, don’t be surprised when she does it about big things.” Often considered to be London’s most exclusive club, 5 Hertford Street hosted Prince Harry’s first date with Meghan, but posted six-figure losses last year. Truss is reported to have previously used it to host “fizz with Liz” dinners with MPs and “biz for Liz” receptions with potential donors, in preparation for a likely leadership bid. A DIT spokesperson said: “This was a diplomatic working dinner attended by the previous international trade secretary, senior UK officials, and US counterparts from our largest single trading partner.” • This article was amended on 3 and 4 January 2022 to correct details of the drinks reportedly ordered at 5 Hertford Street.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/02/liz-truss-hosted-3k-lunch-for-us-envoy-over-civil-service-objections

Stokes is arguably the only viable candidate to replace Root should a change of leadership occur after a one-sided series which Australia lead 3-0 going into the fourth Test starting on Wednesday in Sydney. With a fifth Test in Hobart still to come – not a given as Covid-19 continues to loom over proceedings – others are simply playing for their spots.
But while Root has now overseen 59 Tests, the point where a jaded Alastair Cook ended his record stint in charge in early 2017, Stokes is not expecting a similar outcome yet. He also had words of encouragement for Silverwood that were doubtless welcome after it was confirmed the head coach has the virus and will not return until next week. “I don’t sense that at all with Joe,” Stokes said. “He’s brought this team a long way. He’s done some great things. Obviously this series hasn’t gone too well. Not from a captaincy point of view but from a team and results point of view. Unfortunately, the captain and coach bear the scrutiny for that but there are 10 other guys out there in the field beside the captain. “At the end of the day, the most important people’s opinions are those guys in the dressing room and [Root and Silverwood] have our thorough support. “Captaincy is more than about setting fields, picking the team, making decisions out in the middle. A captain is someone you play for. Joe Root is someone I always want to play for. Chris Silverwood is exactly the same. He’s a real players’ coach. He stands up for you as individuals and players as well.” Asked if he fancied stepping up should Root decide he has run his race, Stokes, the vice-captain, replied: “I’ve said I’ve never really had an ambition to be a captain. That’s totally Joe’s decision. He shouldn’t be forced into doing it. I’m sure Cooky felt the same way. He did it for so long. When he knew his time was up, his time was up. Those discussions haven’t even entered anywhere near Joe yet.”
Root’s commitment was in evidence when England returned to training on Sunday and the captain found himself using the slinger to help his teammates bat in the nets. The coaching staff is now threadbare, Silverwood having tested positive while already isolating with his family in Melbourne, and following on from Jon Lewis (the seam bowling coach), Jeetan Patel (spin coach) and Darren Veness (fitness) last week. To sum things up, the former captain Adam Hollioake drove down from Queensland to Sydney over the weekend after being asked to help out by Graham Thorpe, the acting head coach, only to discover he was a close contact of a positive case and needed to immediately isolate. Soon after, the local net bowlers were forced out of England’s session midway through after one of them received a positive result. “You almost go back to club cricket where you have to do your own stuff,” Stokes said, regarding the farcical situation. “The next couple of days are about getting what you can out of the resources we have available. It’s not ideal but it’s also Sydney at new year, so you’ve got to look for the positives – in a non‑Covid sense.”
Among these is simply a return to the international arena for Stokes, the 30-year-old having taken four months out in the summer to address a finger injury and his mental health. By his own admission his output so far – 101 runs with the bat at 16, four wickets with the ball at 62 – has been “pretty average”. To continue a theme of England’s recent press interactions, he too now wants to put “pride back into the badge”. There was also an acceptance that Australia have been outstanding with the ball, never more so than the second evening in Melbourne when Mitchell Starc reduced England to 31 for four in the final hour and Stokes found himself walking out in front of 49,000 baying home fans after Jack Leach’s appearance as nightwatchman lasted two balls. Stokes, who admitted to delaying his entrance in the hope of shaving off an over before stumps, said: “When I look back at that hour, with Pat Cummins and Mitch Starc bowling, even I was watching that going, ‘I don’t know what I would do to counteract that’. That was some of the highest quality bowling I think I’ve seen in a Test match. “I said to some of the guys the next morning, it’s the first time I’ve actually been taken aback by the atmosphere in a cricket ground. Although we were on the receiving end of that, it was pretty special to feel that at the MCG.”
Though England’s resources are reduced, they appear unlikely to call on any players featuring in the Big Bash League. On Sunday those in the Twenty20 squad who will face West Indies this month – Sam Billings, Saqib Mahmood, Tymal Mills, James Vince, Reece Topley and George Garton – were told to return to the UK by 7 January. Reported initially as if it was a Dunkirk-style evacuation in response to the rising number of Covid cases in Australia, this was always their intended departure in order to begin “safe living guidelines and Covid-19 protocols” before the squad’s flight to Barbados.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/ben-stokes-backs-joe-root-and-says-he-has-no-ambition-to-be-england-captain
5921;5921;Tories must face the real causes of homelessness | Letters ;2022-01-02T17:56:17Z;['N/A'];['Homelessness', 'Conservatives', 'Boris Johnson', 'Housing', 'Politics', 'Poverty', 'Social exclusion', 'Universal credit', 'Benefits', 'Coronavirus', 'Scotland', 'UK news'];"Simon Hattenstone and Daniel Lavelle call for Boris Johnson to support a policy of Housing First, an effort to provide people with housing and only later try to address any other needs, such as addiction (Johnson has a chance to end homelessness now – if he dares to seize it, 28 December). This policy is common sense, but there are good grounds to be sceptical of how it might be implemented. Prof Nicholas Pleace from the University of York has shown how support for Housing First from some corners of our political debate can reflect very different agendas. For example, the Centre for Social Justice – founded by Iain Duncan Smith – supports Housing First, but in ways very different from what Hattenstone and Lavelle have in mind. For this side of the political debate, Housing First can sit with denying the social causes of homelessness and the dysfunctional housing system. Housing First is widely applauded and increasingly evidenced, but also contested. Johnson and his government could leap in support of what could be labelled Housing First, while still taking no systemic action on access to housing, funding for mental health services or the availability of drug and alcohol services. We should seek Johnson’s attention to Housing First, but also make sure that a chaperone keeps watch on what happens later. Andy Guise Senior lecturer in social science and health, King’s College London • The article on homelesseness unearthed disturbing memories. In 1990, I went to the Royal Opera House and parked somewhere near Lincoln’s Inn Fields. Surrounded by lawyers’ offices and fine houses, the green square in the middle was a tented camp for homeless people. When Tony Blair came into office in 1997, homelessness did significantly decrease through the rough sleepers unit. On a rainy evening in 2017, I came out of a theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue. The homeless people were back. Doorways, damp sleeping bags and cardboard again sufficed for shelter. There may be many reasons why people are homeless, but the actions of governments over the last three decades have been the main reason: no building to replace sold council houses; the bedroom tax; the introduction of punitive universal credit; the two-children-only benefit; lack of secure work; rent rises; austerity to make up for lax banking controls. “Everyone in” may be part of the answer, but it is pitiful against the real causes created by successive governments: poverty and lack of affordable decent houses to rent. Karen Wynyard Whitstable, Kent • The searing article on the growth in homelessness under Boris Johnson makes comparisons with humane and effective policies on homelessness in the US and Finland. But within the UK, Scotland has effective policies – as set out in its government’s 2021 Ending Homelessness Together report. Under these policies, Scottish night shelters are kept closed by providing better-quality emergency accommodation; 100,000 genuinely affordable homes were brought on stream. The temporary ban on the enforcement of eviction orders was extended, to provide renters with safe homes during the pandemic. Hardship schemes were introduced to support those struggling to pay their rent and people with no recourse to public funds were helped to avoid destitution. Most importantly, legislation was amended so that no homeless household has to stay in unsuitable accommodation for more than seven days.

However, I have not seen any evidence to suggest that there were any purpose-built “slave pens” in the town (Letters, 13 December). An advert for the sale of “One Negro Man and Two Boys” in Liverpool that took place in 1767 refers to the individuals being “brought up to the place of sale to be viewed”, possibly indicating that they were being kept in a cellar, but currently we can only speculate as to how these people were confined while waiting to be sold as human chattel. In Liverpool, as in other places around the country, the sales of the enslaved usually took place in the coffee houses, taverns and offices of the town’s merchants and brokers.

5926;5926;Tory peer to lead boycott of Coca-Cola over role in Beijing Winter Olympics;2022-01-02T17:43:49Z;['Aubrey Allegretti'];['Winter Olympics Beijing 2022', 'Coca-Cola', 'Conservatives', 'House of Lords', 'China', 'Human rights', 'Asia Pacific', 'Business', 'Law', 'Politics', 'Sport', 'UK news', 'World news', 'Uyghurs', 'Islam', 'Xinjiang'];"A Tory peer has vowed to lead a boycott of Coca-Cola products over the company’s sponsorship of the 2022 Beijing Olympics, saying its bid to profit from an event organised by the Chinese government was shameless. Robert Hayward, who was a founding chairman of the world’s first gay rugby club and a former personnel manager for Coca-Cola Bottlers, said it was unacceptable for firms to help to boost the use of the Winter Games as a propaganda exercise given concerns over the treatment of 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang province. Groups such as Human Rights Watch have accused Xi Jinping’s administration of crimes against humanity, growing repression in Hong Kong, tightened control over the media and mass surveillance.
The UK parliament passed a motion in April 2021 that said genocide was taking place in north-west China, but Beijing has denied any atrocities and accused western politicians of “lies and disinformation”. Concern grew more recently when the Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai disappeared from public life for almost three months after accusing a senior member of the Communist party of sexual assault. Hayward said he would not buy any Coca-Cola products, which include brands such as Innocent, Schweppes and Fanta, and that he hoped large numbers of people would do the same. “If they are going to take that approach, then they have to understand that there are lots of people in this world, many of whom are probably Muslims in many countries but others who are of different faiths, who just think it’s unacceptable that they should participate,” he said. People should use their personal judgment about whether to buy a product or service, but “there comes a point … where you wish to say ‘no, this is just unacceptable’,” he said. “It is a propaganda event and I am not going to go along with it when so many people are currently suffering and losing their liberty.” Hayward said he was taking the stand specifically against Coca-Cola because it was “dependent on a good image with the public” to sell its goods, though he also voiced concern about Proctor & Gamble, another headline sponsor. He said it was unacceptable for firms to “be trying to gain kudos out of a worldwide sporting event hosted by the Chinese government” given it “has been shown in the last few months to be persecuting the Uyghurs to an extreme extent”. “I’m hoping that it sends a message to all major public companies that there is a benefit and a dis-benefit to associating themselves with major sporting events,” he said, adding he would raise the issue in the House of Lords soon. Drawing on his experience as a former chief executive of the British Soft Drinks Association, Hayward said Coca-Cola should have had a “force majeure” clause in its sponsorship contract with the Olympic organisers that it could activate if necessary, allowing it to pull out over China’s actions.
By refusing to buy the products over the next few months, individuals could send a message in a way that would be much better than “the kneejerk reaction of saying the sportsmen and women should boycott the Olympics”, he said. A spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee said sponsors “provide valuable financial resources that support the development of sport at all levels around the world”, helping it to redistribute the equivalent of about $3.4m (£2.5m) a day to athletes and sports organisations at all levels. They said sponsors played no role in the selection of the host country for each Games. Coca-Cola did not respond to a request for comment, but the company said on its website it is “the longest-running, continuous sponsor” of both the summer and winter Olympics. “We believe the Olympic movement is a force for good, bringing people and countries together, and we’re proud to use our name to raise its profile and support the world’s most watched and revered international sporting event,” it said.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/tory-to-lead-boycott-of-coca-cola-over-role-in-beijing-winter-olympics
5927;5927;NI peace architect accuses Boris Johnson of ‘casual political vandalism’;2022-01-02T17:40:47Z;"[""Lisa O'Carroll""]";['Northern Ireland', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Brexit', 'Boris Johnson', 'Good Friday agreement', 'European Union', 'David Frost', 'Europe', 'Foreign policy', 'International trade', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Global economy', 'World news'];"One of the architects of the Northern Ireland peace deal has said Boris Johnson and the former Brexit minister Lord Frost have risked “all the work” the previous generation of politicians put into the Belfast Good Friday agreement by putting their hard ideological beliefs ahead of people. Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s former chief of staff and chief negotiator on Northern Ireland, said he was concerned that neither the prime minister nor the recently resigned Brexit minister seemed to understand or care about the fragility of the political settlement in Northern Ireland in 1998.
He also questioned why Frost had made the issue of the European court of justice a red line in negotiations on the Northern Ireland protocol when it was not responsible for either the practical difficulties in trade or the identity politics that has been heightened by the row over the Irish Sea border. He said it was irresponsible to stoke the fears of one side or another or to fail to calm nerves about British identity after rioting on the streets earlier in 2020. “What worries me is the casual political vandalism. They really don’t seem to care. I mean the damage they are doing to the very fragile political settlements in Northern Ireland, by posturing on things like the European court of justice, which do not matter to voters in Northern Ireland,” he said. “They may matter to Boris Johnson and some supporters [in the government] and the ideological base. “But is it really worth sacrificing all the work that previous generations of politicians put into the Northern Ireland peace process on the ideological altar of the ECJ?” he asked. Lord Frost had repeatedly threatened to suspend parts of the protocol arrangements using its article 16 before he resigned as Brexit minister citing differences over tax policy and Covid restrictions. While the appointment of the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to succeed Frost was initially read as a reset moment, publicly she is presenting herself as the continuity negotiator. “The UK position has not changed. We need goods to flow freely between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, end the role of the ECJ as the final arbiter of disputes between us, and resolve other issues,” she said before Christmas. Powell warned the institutions of devolved government could collapse unless the British government focused on the practical problems created by the post-Brexit customs and physical checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. While he doesn’t expect a return to the troubles of the past, he said Brexit created an ongoing issue in Northern Ireland. “You have to face up to the fact that Brexit requires someone to get hurt. “There is nothing you can do about the political issue of identity given the history of two communities in Northern Ireland. But there is going to be a border because of Brexit and it has to be somewhere. No one’s come up with a better idea than in the Irish Sea. If it is there, it affects unionist identity and what you have to do is ameliorate the impact of it,” he said. His comments came after not just the transfer of power from Frost to Truss but a changing political landscape south of the Irish border. “Brexit has put talk of a united Ireland firmly on the agenda south of the border and the government needs to pay attention to this and to understand how that is also fuelling unionist fears about the future of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom,” he said. “Identity politics is going to keep coming back. Imagine if you have a border poll on a united Ireland and 48% for remaining in the United Kingdom, a bit like the Brexit referendum. “People don’t want to address that problem. I understand. But it’s the fear of that that’s causing the trouble.” In an interview published on Sunday, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, said Truss should set a deadline for the talks with the EU over the protocol. He would not say how much longer should be allowed, but he told the Sunday Telegraph: “January is going to be an absolutely crucial month.” And if the deadline passed without a deal acceptable to the UK, the government should trigger article 16, he said. “If we don’t get rapid and decisive progress, and one side or the other is kicking the can down the road, this will have major implications for the stability of the political institutions in Northern Ireland,” he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/02/ni-peace-architect-accuses-boris-johnson-of-casual-political-vandalism
5928;5928;Andy Newman obituary;2022-01-02T17:38:50Z;['N/A'];['Gardens', 'London', 'Communities'];"My friend Andy Newman, who has died aged 56, was a community leader who built an award-winning public garden on disused land. From those green shoots he and his partner, Karen Clark, galvanised local people in the network of north London roads known as Harringay Gardens to fight back against pollution, traffic and urban blight, bringing greenery and cooperation to our neighbourhood.  In 1996, when Andy and Karen moved to the area, there was on their doorstep a derelict patch of land leading to a railway arch. Once an entrance to the now-demolished Harringay stadium on the other side of the tracks, the land had become a dumping ground for old cars and other rubbish, and a crime hotspot. Andy later recalled meeting an elderly neighbour who had “peered out of her bedroom window as a young girl and watched cows being herded under the railway arch to graze at the local watercress farm ... We had just started a young family and this image gave us the determination to bring the land back into natural use.” That is exactly what Andy and Karen, both keen gardeners, did, with trademark tenacity and wiliness, plus a package of government funding channelled into the wider area, which at the time had seen a startling increase in gang violence. Vital to the garden’s success was the simultaneous formation of a community group, the Gardens Residents Association, which began transforming the streets through the planting of trees, initiatives to curtail fly-tipping and crime, and the reduction of heavy traffic which had long blighted the area. Six roads became what would these days be termed a low traffic neighbourhood, provoking, then as now, polarising and powerful opinions. The effect was instant – without thousands of cars a day cutting through, a shortcut became a community again, almost overnight. In 2002, thanks to Andy, it got a community centre to call its own – albeit one without a roof. The community garden remains a moment of beauty and respite in a dense urban environment, stocked with fabulous plants now in their prime – including several of Andy’s much-favoured giant echium. The garden, which raises all its own funds, hosts outdoor film screenings, Halloween events, egg hunts and Christmas gatherings. It has spawned a successful “play streets” initiative, and many other family- and nature-focused events. It has stretched out its roots into the local streets for two decades; trees, bulbs and shrubs flourish where once there were none.  The garden is open to everyone and will celebrate its 20th anniversary in September. The association has been no less successful, winning more than 40 local and national awards. Both residents’ association and garden were turbo-charged by Andy’s knowledge, hard work and resilience. His legacy is all around his friends and neighbours, and will not be forgotten. Andy was born in Exeter, Devon, the youngest of three sons of Irene (nee Pye), a care assistant, and Lewis, a shoemaker. After leaving Clyst Vale community college, he studied interior design at South Devon College of Arts and Technology, and 3D design at Suffolk College of Higher and Further Education. He was a freelance artist and designer for most of his working life until joining Southwark council in 2013. He is survived by Karen and their children, Amber and Jasper, and by his brother Peter. Another brother, David, predeceased him.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/andy-newman-obituary
5929;5929;Capitol attack: Cheney says Republicans must choose between Trump and truth;2022-01-02T17:03:51Z;['Martin Pengelly'];['US Capitol attack', 'US politics', 'US Congress', 'House of Representatives', 'US news', 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'World news'];"On a day of alarming polling about attitudes to political violence and fears for US democracy, and as the first anniversary of the Capitol attack approached, a Republican member of the House committee investigating the events of 6 January 2021 had a stark warning for her party.
“Our party has to choose,” Liz Cheney told CBS’s Face the Nation. “We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the constitution, but we cannot be both.” Trump supporters attacked Congress in an attempt to stop certification of his defeat by Joe Biden, which Trump maintains without evidence was the result of electoral fraud. Five people died around a riot in which a mob roamed the Capitol, searching for lawmakers to capture and possibly kill. On Sunday, Cheney and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the committee chairman, again discussed the possibility of a criminal referral for Trump over his failure to attempt to stop the riot or for his obstruction of the investigation. Speaking to ABC’s This Week, Cheney said there were “potential criminal statutes at issue here, but I think that there’s absolutely no question that it was a dereliction of duty. And I think one of the things the committee needs to look at is … a legislative purpose, is whether we need enhanced penalties for that kind of dereliction of duty.” Thompson said subpoenas could be served on Republicans in Congress who refuse to comply with information requests of the kind that have led to a charge of criminal contempt of Congress for Steve Bannon, Trump’s former strategist, and a recommendation of such a charge for Mark Meadows, Trump’s chief of staff. The Democrat told NBC’s Meet the Press the committee was examining whether it could issue subpoenas to members of Congress, immediately Jim Jordan of Ohio and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. “I think there are some questions of whether we have the authority to do it,” Thompson said. “If the authorities are there, there’ll be no reluctance on our part.” Last month, the committee asked Jordan for testimony about conversations with Trump on 6 January. Jordan told Fox News he had “real concerns” about the credibility of the panel. Perry was asked for testimony about attempts to replace Jeffrey Rosen, acting head of the justice department, with Jeffrey Clark, an official who tried to help overturn Trump’s defeat. Perry called the committee “illegitimate, and not duly constituted”. A court has ruled that the panel is legitimate and entitled to see White House records Trump is trying to shield, an argument that has reached the supreme court. Sunday saw a rash of polls marking the anniversary of 6 January. CBS found that 68% of Americans saw the Capitol attack as a sign of increasing political violence, and that 66% thought democracy itself was threatened. When respondents were asked if violence would be justifiable to achieve various political ends, the poll returned an average of about 30%. A survey by the Washington Post and the University of Maryland said more than a third of Americans said violence against the government could be justified. ABC News and Ipsos found that 52% of Republicans said the Capitol rioters were trying to protect democracy. Other polling has shown clear majorities among Republicans in believing Trump’s lie about electoral fraud and distrust of federal elections. On CNN’s State of the Union, Larry Hogan, Maryland governor and a moderate Republican with an eye on the presidential nomination, said: “Frankly, it’s crazy that that many people believe things that simply aren’t true. “There’s been an amazing amount of disinformation that’s been spread over the past year. And many people are consuming that disinformation and believing it as if it’s fact. To think the violent protesters who attacked the Capitol, our seat of democracy, on 6 January was just tourists looking at statues? It’s insane that anyone could watch that on television and believe that’s what happened.” Cheney told CBS the blame lay squarely with her own party. “Far too many Republicans are trying to enable the former president, embrace the former president or look the other way and hope that the former president goes away, or trying to obstruct the activities of this committee, but we won’t be deterred. At the end of the day, the facts matter, the truth matters.” Her host, Margaret Brennan, pointed out that Republicans across the US, some in states where Trump’s attempt to steal the election was repulsed, are changing election laws to their advantage. “We’ve got to be grounded on the rule of law,” Cheney said. “We’ve got to be grounded on fidelity of the constitution … So I think for people all across the country, they need to recognise how important their vote is for their voices. They’ve got to elect serious people who are going to defend the constitution, not simply do the bidding of Donald Trump.”
Cheney faces a primary challenger doing Trump’s bidding and enjoying his backing. The other Republican on the 6 January committee, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, will retire in November rather than fight such a battle of his own. Cheney said she was “confident people of Wyoming will not choose loyalty to one man as dangerous as Donald Trump”, and that she will secure re-election. She also notably did not say no when she was asked if she would run against Trump if he sought the nomination next time.

Nicola, whose 24-year-old son has been detained under the Mental Health Act since September 2017 at Cheadle Royal hospital in Cheshire, said his care is “worse than being in prison” and “people wouldn’t treat an animal” as badly. She has appointed lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to explore a legal challenge to his circumstances which include constant monitoring by CCTV and outdoor access into a fenced-off garden at the facility which is run by the private Priory Group. “We fully appreciate that my son has complex needs but he’s being treated terribly,” she said. “He’s locked away from the world and has no physical contact with anyone.” He also has a learning disability and Tourette syndrome and has been treated for aggression and anxiety. “I can’t even hold his hand or hug him because of the conditions he’s kept in,” his mother said. “Every time I see him it breaks my heart. He has no quality of life, he just exists.” Campaigners are calling for greater efforts to provide care in the community for people like Nicola’s son and say about 2,000 people are held in such “assessment and treatment units (ATUs)” in hospitals, with about half of them having been there for at least two years. The placements are expensive partly because they require so many staff. Mencap, a learning disability charity, said many of the people in inpatient units ended up there because of the lack of funding for social care and not because they have a genuine need for inpatient mental health care. “The government must treat this scandal with the urgency that’s needed,” said Dan Scorer, head of policy at the charity. He said ministers had “broken promise after promise to close beds and support people in the community”. The standard of some care homes for people with learning disabilities is also under growing scrutiny. In October, the Guardian revealed how conditions at Berkeley House, a care home in Kent run by a private chain, Achieve Together, declined so badly families were given less than a day’s notice of its closure. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission found residents “living in inhumane conditions”, according to a recently completed inspection report. There was no toilet roll and “faeces was found on two people’s bedding, pillows and another person’s chair”. One resident had no bedding at all and staff had damaged residents’ furniture. Inspectors “observed a staff member pushing and forcing a person to sit in their wheelchair against their will” and others using derogatory language. There were not enough qualified staff, one bedroom stank of urine and safeguarding incidents went unreported. “Staff spoke with people in a harsh tone and were focused on tasks rather than engaging with people to meet their emotional needs,” the inspectors reported, before labelling the facility “inadequate” and triggering its closure. A spokesperson for Achieve Together, which is ultimately owned by an international investment fund, said: “We unreservedly apologise for the unacceptable shortcomings … We are clear that the provision fell way below the high standards that the people we support rightly expect and deserve, and that we know we can provide.” The cases come a decade after the Winterbourne View scandal, in which BBC Panorama exposed the abuse of people with learning disabilities in a private hospital in Gloucestershire. Kirsty Stuart, a public law and human rights lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing Nicola and her son, known as patient A, said she was now representing 25 other families whose loved ones are in ATUs. “They feel they have no option but to seek legal advice in order for their loved ones to receive the care they deserve,” she said. “We call on the Priory, the CCG and local authority to work with ourselves and Patient A’s family to reach an agreement over his care, which the family believe should be in the community as this would give him the best quality of life.” Liverpool city council said it could not comment on individual cases. A spokesperson for the Priory Group said it was committed to “ensuring well-planned transfers to the most appropriate community settings whenever they become available” but said: “Some individuals with highly complex behaviours, and detained under the Mental Health Act, can be difficult to place despite all parties working very hard over a long period of time to find the right setting.” It said care was continually reviewed to ensure the “least restrictive setting possible”. A spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care said: “We are determined to continue reducing the number of autistic people and people with a learning disability in mental health hospitals as well as the reliance on inpatient care. That’s why we are investing in community services and supporting discharges with £90m of additional funding this financial year.” NHS Liverpool clinical commissioning group has been contacted for comment.;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/02/family-of-autistic-man-plan-legal-challenge-over-care-conditions
5931;5931;Fauci: hospitalization figures a better guide to Omicron than case count ;2022-01-02T16:45:52Z;['Richard Luscombe'];['Biden administration', 'Anthony Fauci', 'Joe Biden', 'US news', 'US politics', 'Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus'];"The US government’s top medical adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, has joined a growing body of experts who say hospitalisation figures form a better guide to the severity of the Omicron coronavirus variant than the traditional case-count of new infections.
Referring to the Omicron surge in the US as a “tsunami”, Fauci also cautioned the public not to be fooled by preliminary data suggesting the variant lacks the severity of earlier Covid-19 variants, such as Delta. “You have a virus that looks like it might be less severe, at least from data we’ve gathered from South Africa, the UK and even some from preliminary data from here in the US,” he told CNN’s State of the Union. “It’s a very interesting, somewhat complicated issue … so many people are getting infected that the net amount, the total amount of people that will require hospitalisation, might be up. We can’t be complacent in these reports. We’re still going to get a lot of hospitalisations.” On ABC’s This Week, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked if it was time to focus less on just the case count, which has soared close to 500,000 reported new daily infections. A number of experts have questioned if such reports cause unnecessary worry, and suggest deaths and hospitalisation data should better inform mitigation efforts. “The answer is, overall, yes,” Fauci said. “This is particularly relevant if you’re having an infection that is much, much more asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic, particularly in people who are vaccinated and boosted. “The real bottom line that you want to be concerned about is, are we getting protected by the vaccines from severe disease leading to hospitalisation?” The Biden administration has made improving vaccination rates a priority but concedes progress is slower than it would like. Fewer than 25% of US children are vaccinated, pediatric hospital admissions are surging and nationally only 62% of eligible residents are fully vaccinated with barely a third receiving a booster. “I’m still very concerned about the tens of millions of people who are not vaccinated at all because even though many of them are going to get asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, a fair number of them are going to get severe disease,” Fauci said. Surging infection rates, Fauci told CNN, will cause disruption to everyday life, already evidenced in pressure on healthcare in several states and in other areas such as education and public transport. A number of universities and school districts will begin 2022 online and in New York City several subway lines have been suspended because of staff shortages. Fauci said those concerns contributed to the decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week to reduce the recommended isolation period for those who have tested positive but are asymptomatic, from 10 days to five. “You’re certainly gonna see stresses on the system, the system being people with any kind of jobs, particularly with critical jobs, to keep society functioning normally. We already know there are reports from fire departments, from police departments in different cities, that sometimes 30% of the people are ill. “The CDC is trying to get a position where people without symptoms who are infected, that you can get them back to work a little bit earlier if they remain without symptoms.” But he rejected criticism that the change was sparked by economic pressure rather than science. “In the second half of a 10-day period, which would normally be a 10-day isolation period, the likelihood of transmissibility is considerably lower,” he said. “For that reason, the CDC made the judgement that it would be relatively low risk to get people out. “You’re right [that] people are concerned about, ‘Why not test people at that time?’ I myself feel that that’s a reasonable thing to do. I believe that the CDC soon will be coming out with more clarification of that since it obviously has generated a number of questions about that five-day period.” The new mayor of New York, Eric Adams, said he thought the city was doing “an amazing job” of reacting to the shifting challenges of the pandemic, including transportation issues and having one-fifth of police out sick.
“We are pivoting based on where the urgency is located. We’re not taking it one-size-fits-all, we’re thinking about it and making the right moves and decisions,” he told ABC. “I was with my police commissioner. We have a 20% sick rate but now we have officers coming back after the five days. “But we can’t live through variants. We spent $11tn on Covid and we don’t have another $11tn, so our lives can’t be based on what’s the new variant. No. We have to figure out, how do we adjust? “I say to those who are not vaccinated, ‘Stop it. It’s time to get vaccinated. It’s time to have the booster shots. You’re endangering yourself and you’re endangering the public and your family as well.’”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/fauci-covid-omicron-hospitalizations-case-count
5932;5932;More than 137,000 new Covid cases reported in England and Wales on Sunday;2022-01-02T16:32:07Z;['Nicola Davis'];['Coronavirus', 'England', 'Wales', 'UK news'];"More than 137,000 new Covid cases have been reported for England and Wales on Sunday, official data reveals, as concerns grow about the spread to older adults. Figures have not been reported for Scotland or Northern Ireland due to the new year weekend, but in the past 24 hours 137,583 new Covid cases have been reported for England and Wales combined. The figures for England and Wales also show that there were another 73 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, while in England there were 13,151 patients in hospital, up from 12,615 the day before. On Saturday cases in England alone hit 162,572, a new record high for daily reported cases. However, figures tend to be lower on Sundays and early in the week as a result of fewer tests being taken over the weekend. Daily case numbers refer to cases by date reported, only cover infections picked up by testing and do not include reinfections – although the Guardian understands these may be included from the end of January – meaning the true number of infections will be higher still. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter has said the UK’s daily Covid infections could be closer to 500,000 given normally less than half of infections are recorded as positive cases, while reinfections are not counted and testing is limited, meaning the proportion could now be even smaller.
According to data from the Zoe Covid study, there were 205,235 new symptomatic cases of Covid alone in the UK on New Year’s Eve, based on PCR and lateral flow test data as of two days ago, with almost 2.4 million people predicted to currently have symptomatic Covid. According to official data for England, while cases began rising sooner among younger age groups, since around the middle of last month they have also been rising rapidly in those over the age of 60. Tim Colbourn, professor of global health systems, epidemiology and evaluation at the UCL Institute for Global Health, said that the peak of the Omicron wave might also be some weeks away. “Case numbers in London – which is ahead of the rest of the country in the Omicron wave – seem to be going up again after voluntary reduced mixing before Xmas had suggested a peak,” he told the Guardian, noting that still-incomplete cases by specimen date are the highest ever for London at 31,444 on 29 December. “Xmas and New Year’s mixing is likely to increase cases in London and the whole of the UK further over the coming days,” Colbourn added. Prof Graham Medley, a member of Sage, said data on cases is hard to interpret directly at the moment, given that testing supply is probably below demand. “More importantly, the delays in testing that are changing day to day make it harder to understand the dynamics,” he added. “But any rise in cases in older people is a concern.” Prof Andrew Hayward, co-director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, agreed. “Omicron moving into the older population is a pivotal moment in the Omicron crisis. We only really expect hospitalisation rates to rise dramatically a couple of weeks after the infection has started to infect the older population, who are at most risk of severe disease,” he said. “We will likely start to see the impact of intergenerational mixing over Christmas on hospitalisation rates over the next week or two. Also, as the elderly were the first to get boosted they have had longest for immunity to wear off.” Prof Adam Finn, of the University of Bristol and a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said questions remain about the proportion of older people who will become sick enough to require hospitalisation in the coming few weeks. “It’s now clear that a smaller proportion of people who get Omicron infection end up in hospital than was the case with earlier variants, although it remains unclear how much of this welcome trend is down to immunity from vaccines and previous infections and how much down to this new variant being a less aggressive virus,” he said. “Either way, although we are learning fast, the margins of uncertainty around this Omicron wave are still wide and people would be well advised to remain cautious and avoid infection as best they can for now as it still looks as though we are in for a very tough couple of months at least.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/more-than-137000-new-covid-cases-reported-in-england-and-wales-on-sunday
5933;5933;Super poo: the emerging science of stool transplants and designer gut bacteria;2022-01-02T16:30:24Z;['Tory Shepherd'];['Health', 'Australia news', 'Science', 'South Australia', 'Adelaide', 'Cancer'];"Good poo donors are so hard to find they’re sometimes called “unicorns”. These elusive, healthy creatures service a market for faecal transplants that is growing rapidly as evidence of its benefits mounts. Emerging science shows that a human’s microbiome – their constellation of gut microbes – has a far greater effect on health than anyone previously imagined. This enormous ecosystem we host in our bodies includes bacteria, fungi, viruses and more. The collective genetic material in the microbiome performs myriad functions that affect our mood, our immunity, and our physical and mental health. Crappy western diets and antibiotics are depleting our microbiota. And in some cases, a person’s microbiome is disordered enough that it needs a little boost from someone else’s.
Restoring them to health has become a very serious scientific endeavour, as the diversity of our gut bacteria is linked to everything from depression to how we respond to cancer treatment. The transfer of healthy stool into the gastrointestinal tract of an unhealthy recipient has been proven to treat people with intestinal conditions, including the superbug Clostridium difficile colitis, or C diff – which can cause diarrhoea, sepsis and even death. But as scientific understanding of the microbiome improves, the possibilities of faecal transplants are expanding. Now researchers are working on a “super stool” – a poo pellet you can eat that mimics a so-called unicorn’s special abilities. Replicating unicorns BiomeBank’s office is located in a hub in the suburbs of Adelaide. Chief medical officer Sam Costello and chief executive Thomas Mitchell wear lanyards emblazoned with depictions of bacteria – and Costello jokes that an organic-looking spill on his is probably a real-life experiment. The biotech company has been on a unicorn hunt. This place is home to a stool bank – and it’s a place where designer poo transplants are made.
There’s a special donor room (a glorified toilet) where poo donations are received. There’s a lab with an anaerobic work station, where donors’ bacteria strains are put into a “secret sauce” to grow and then isolate strains. Those strains are categorised and catalogued for future use. BiomeBank’s head of donor screening, Dr Emily Tucker, says there’s a long list of requirements for a stool donor. They have to be healthy, obviously. They have to be screened for infections. A detailed history of their medical, travel and antibiotic history is taken. Those who make it through all the assessments are enrolled for an eight-week program where they have to turn up on time, fill out a questionnaire, then (ahem) make a deposit inside a special room. So what happens if there aren’t enough unicorns? That question inspired BiomeBank’s latest endeavour – to replicate the contents of a unicorn’s guts. The poo factory People are building libraries of the very best that poo has to offer, and BiomeBank is part of the effort to categorise premium stool strains. Costello, a gastroenterologist, says that humans historically had much more diverse microbiota. We lived more closely with other people and with animals, and we ate more unprocessed food. There’s evidence, he says, that this depletion is evident across society – particularly western society.
He describes a “microbial extinction event” in the modern world. As on Earth, so it is in our intestinal system – we’re living with the consequences of a hollowed-out ecosystem. Mitchell explains that in BiomeBank’s first generation of microbial therapy they extracted the right bacteria, freeze dried it and put it in a capsule. Patients can take it orally to treat specific infections. This generation has already been rolled out in hospitals, and, if approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, it will be the first microbial therapy in the world approved as a biologic (it currently has provisional approval). Then there’s the second generation – a replication. Think of the unicorns as Adam and Eve types, but their genomic sequences can be reproduced. You can grow them. Isolate them. Identify them, name them, put them in a library, and gradually build up knowledge about what each strand can do.
And when you hit a vein of gold – a bacterial strain that sorts out a deficiency in someone’s microbiota – you scale it. Then you put it that bespoke bacterial recipe in a capsule that someone else swallows. “It’s a new way to treat disease,” Mitchell says. “It’s a little factory.” Why is the microbiome so important? From the moment we’re born, and throughout our lives, our microbiota are shaped by our environmental and dietary inputs. Babies born by caesarean section have a different mix to those delivered vaginally, a major study has found. The C-section babies pick up more strains from the hospital, which could explain higher rates of immune problems such as asthma and allergies in those babies. Prof Felice Jacka, director of Deakin University’s Food and Mood Centre, is a nutritional psychiatrist (and the author of There’s a Zoo in My Poo, which features recipes for “better bog burgers”, “farty toast” and “zoo poo stew”). The centre examines the “mindbogglingly complex” links between diet, gut and brain health. “You have all these organisms that interact with each other in a way that’s impossible to map at this stage,” she says. “We’re still really at the beginning of working out what microbiota can do.”
And Jacka’s a fan of the “super stool” plan, not least because “giving people other people’s shit” has a bit of the icks about it. “It’s absolutely worth doing,” she says. “Finding those super donors is hard. Only about 3% of people qualify … Those super poopers are kind of rare, so it you can distill that, if BiomeBank can come up with a stool equivalent, it’d be awesome.” Jacka, as one of the world’s top microbiome experts, says scientists are still working out exactly how the gut-brain axis works, how the microbiome affects health, and how it can be manipulated. There are dozens of studies under way in Australia, but existing research has already shown that a bad diet – like the standard American diet – leads to increased inflammation in the body, which means a higher risk of cancer.
A team from the Imperial College London and the University of Pittsburgh compared African Americans to rural South Africans. The volunteers were tested, then swapped diets and were tested again. After just two weeks on the fibre-rich rural diet, the Americans had significantly less colon inflammation and a lower cancer risk. Unfortunately, the rural group went the other way. Cancer and the gut The Food and Mood Centre is studying nutrition and its effect on depression, on muscle and heart health, on psychotic disorders, on post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders and a host of other health concerns. Jacka nominates cancer research as one of the most exciting fields in microbiome studies. Data show better responses to treatment, particularly immunotherapy, in people with more diverse gut microbes. But she warns much research is still nascent, and that industries out to make a buck are capitalising on it too quickly, selling products with vague promises of promoting “gut health”. “Be aware, keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out. Or your wallet, more to the point,” she advises.
The University of New South Wales’ Microbiome Research Centre is studying the effect of the microbiome on cancer, women and children’s health, infection, immunity, inflammation, critical care, and mental health and neuroscience. The centre’s director, Prof Emad El-Omar, says there while there is advanced research showing the benefit of a more diverse microbiome (and therefore faecal transplants) when dealing with C diff, in other disorders researchers are still working through what works, and how. He says the the number of genes in these microorganisms dwarfs that of the human genome. “It’s a very exciting field, but there’s still a bit of work to be done to maximise the benefit for all humanity.” And he agrees with Jacka, that the “wellness” industry is sometimes jumping the gun on “gut health”. How can you help your gut? At this stage, poo transplants are only recommended, or useful, in very specific cases. But everyone can improve their microbiome – and you don’t need supplements. Jacka says for most people changing their diet is enough to change their bacteria. “To have what we understand to be a healthy microbiota, where the microbes present are associated with healthy conditions and those that aren’t present that are associated with unhealthy conditions, we already know what you should do,” she says.
“Eat lots of plants, different types of plants, different-coloured plants and throw in some fermented foods.” Think kimchi, kombucha and sauerkraut. And think fibre. Jacka says that with typical western diets your gut microbiota is so “weak, wan, pale and deficient” that it just can’t cope with fibre. Then when people try to incorporate more roughage, they get gas or a stomach ache. Some people then mistakenly think they have irritable bowel syndrome or a gluten intolerance and back off the fibrous foods. You have to start gently, she says. Increase the amount and type of fibre gradually. “The answer to a problem with beans,” she says, “is actually more beans”. Costello says BiomeBank hopes to be “part of the global effort work to solve this big problem, which is this loss of microbial diversity associated with disease … on a massive scale”. “We see it as a modern pandemic,” Costello says. And there is plenty of work still to be done. At BiomeBank, researchers are beginning to understand the microbiome strains in frozen storage. Then there are the many strains yet to be understood – we don’t know yet what they might one day be capable of. Costello and Mitchell call that library of the known and unknown, next door to the unicorns’ toilet, the “cave of wonders”.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/super-poo-the-emerging-science-of-stool-transplants-and-designer-gut-bacteria
5934;5934;Why ‘pruning’ friends has been so common during the pandemic;2022-01-02T16:30:23Z;['N/A'];['Coronavirus', 'Australian lifestyle', 'Life and style', 'Psychology', 'Society'];"Pruning is usually a technique applied to roses in winter, but more recently the gardening term has been cropping up whenever sociologists talk about our social lives. People have been pruning friends. Confined to our homes, or separated by borders, with too much time gifted to us in isolation, and new ways to communicate online, experts say we’ve unwittingly – or in some cases very deliberately – socially distanced ourselves out of a social life. Some say the silver lining is that we’ve been cured of Fomo, others say it heralds a widening of the already growing loneliness gap. So has everyone Marie Kondoed their mates, and what does this mean for the future of friendship?
Bryan and his wife have two children, aged six and four. They haven’t really made any new friends in the past two years, and they dropped out of contact with a couple of close friends. “Just through no energy, nothing to talk about, no social setting, or parent life commitments.” The couple thought they might make new friends when their eldest started primary school but rolling lockdowns stymied those opportunities. Meanwhile, there is one friend Bryan doesn’t know how to approach. “It’s the one that hurts the most – but I think maybe I thought the friendship was stronger than it was,” he says. “Nothing bad happened … I just … had to stop trying to make social things happen.” Roger Patulny, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Wollongong, says a lot of people “got very serious and they focused on the people most important to them in their lives”. “So there was sort of a bunkering down … The difficulty now is adjusting to coming out of that, and reengaging in those more distant connections.” It’s possible that Bryan was pruned, or that he subconsciously made the cut himself. Now, many people like Bryan genuinely don’t know where to start when it comes to rebuilding their social lives. We’re caught between re-embracing the office, the gym, the classroom and wanting to resist these places entirely. The incidental friendships of those spaces, along with the opportunity to make new friends, is still not a given, and effort needs to be made to reach out and rebuild. ‘Particular groups were more vulnerable to losing friends’ Patulny and colleague Marlee Bower from the Matilda Centre for Research in Mental Health and Substance Use at the University of Sydney have surveyed more than 2,000 Australians over the past two years to capture a collective picture of people’s interactions, lifestyles and plans during and after lockdown. Given Australia’s early, if temporary, exit from lockdown last year, it offers a unique glimpse not just about Australians’ experience during lockdown but importantly, and pertinently, many months post-lockdown.
Some key findings came out of the study, says Patulny. “Social networks have become more insular and bonding-oriented, plus particular groups of people were more vulnerable to losing friends, including singles, or those with social anxiety, physical and mental disabilities – anyone lacking ‘prior social capital’. Then there were the people who were caught at major intersections of their life journey – think finishing school/starting uni/having kids; they could be more vulnerable to long-term disconnection and loneliness.” Like Bryan with his child starting school, Reggie was unlucky enough to be hovering at a “life intersection” when the pandemic hit. She completed year 12 in 2020. The opportunity to make or cement friendships has been curtailed especially severely for young people. “The fear that we have missed out on so much … Makes me want to be in a million places at one time,” she says. But as with any aspect of this pandemic, the most vulnerable members of the community have suffered the biggest fallout. “Those lacking physical health, social capital and digital interactive skills are already more marginalised and at greater risk of loneliness in the post-Covid-19 world,” Patulny warns. It’s too early to tell whether that has the potential to “grow into entrenched cultures of loneliness, or an expanded ‘loneliness gap’”, but even the general signs pre-pandemic point to people having fewer friends. Thirty years ago, 33% of US adults reported having 10 or more close friends, not counting relatives. Now, 13% say that. People already had less time to invest in friendships (one 2018 study says it takes 50 hours together to make a casual friend, and 90 hours before you consider them a good friend) but the unique social dilemmas imposed by the pandemic could have serious long-term consequences for some people. Melbourne-based counsellor Monica spoke to many single people who were worried in the midst of lockdown about whether they’d be picked to be in a bubble or asked to join a picnic. Restrictions on the number of humans interacting meant grown adults were once again reduced to the schoolyard dilemma of picking their one best friend. “Often they weren’t asked, and they were too afraid to take the initiative to ask anyone else themselves,” says Monica. “That perceived rejection, real or otherwise, has now really dented their confidence going back out into the world.”
Pat struggled with social connection and loneliness pre-pandemic and is now trying to find avenues where they can make connections after lockdowns. They’re not having much luck so far. “It’s funny, actually, I didn’t feel lonely at all during lockdown – but as soon as things opened up this year and last, it started up again.” ‘It’s cut to the core of people for me’ For many older people cut off from families and traditional get-togethers with friends, the pandemic offered a crash course in online communication, in a way that could continue to shape how they keep in touch with people. Research from the Australian Communications and Media Authority shows that the number of people aged 75 and over using social media and emails to connect doubled. Without the physical context of the cafe, the office or the gym, people found other ways to, almost instantly, rank and order our friends. There were the dozens of designated WhatsApp groups, the few friends you pinged with random texts about recipes or dogs, the handful of people you’d DM on Instagram, family you’d fight with in the Facebook comments, colleagues doomed to Zoom, and the one friend you might actually pick up the phone to. So where do those friends rank now? It helps to start by asking ourselves exactly what friends are for. Countless studies tell us why we need them, including linking them to the health of our hearts. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle might offer some clues. Friends were central to his overall conception of what constitutes a good life, and what it means to be human. But even the philosopher ranked his pals into three different types of friendship: friendships of utility, friendships of pleasure and “friendships of the good”. Co-workers and classmates fall under friendships of utility. A friend that sparks joy comes under friendships of pleasure – the friends of love affairs, book clubs, footy teams. But most important of all are those friendships of the good, which are based upon mutual respect, admiration and a strong desire to “aid and assist the other person because one recognises an essential goodness in them”. These top-shelf companions have most sustained us in the past two years, and they’re also the ones we’re most keen to keep.
Patulny and Bower’s study finds that “rather than experiencing a wholesale loss in connections and increased loneliness, many instead consolidated networks, and shifted from broad, locally-focused bridging networks towards more selective, online, bonding networks”. For many, a shared experience of a deeply traumatic time has either solidified existing friendships or forged new significant friends. Stephanie made local friends for the first time during the pandemic. Parents from her children’s school, who hadn’t known each well, started spilling their guts on WhatsApp once they went into lockdown. Then Stephanie’s young daughter contracted Covid. “They were the first to drop things, share information with the school and protect our family. Local friends are a new thing for me … I think it’s easier to become deep friends more quickly, to say I’m not doing OK and to be more open for others to say the same. It’s cut to the core of people for me.” Rose lived alone throughout the pandemic. “It was about vulnerability. I realised once I opened up about what I was going through, that created room for my friends to open up too. Being real with each other through Covid brought us closer. During lockdowns, I used socials a lot to connect. But now I love socialising in person, more than before. I’m normally introverted, but iso was too lonely, so I’ve swung in the other direction towards extroversion. I’m throwing parties, where once upon a time I dreaded those. And I’m going out of my way to make new friends.” But while it’s wonderful to focus on the friendships that enrich us, Patulny and Bower warn that we can’t forget “the cost of potentially increased social and collective loneliness through losing more distant community connections”. As we all muddle through maintaining a social life while continuing to deal with rolling uncertainty, for some the future of friendship will mean offering people the space to flake on a party, to not text back, to let friends check back in when they’re ready. For others, it’ll mean jumping at any opportunity to meet new mates. Like Bryan and his wife, Melbourne based Cynthia hadn’t really met anyone new over the last couple of years. But she recently struck up a conversation with a stranger at the local cafe, and liked them immediately. At first she tried to play it cool, but eventually she figured “fuck it – I invited them over for a BBQ.

We can safely assume, however, that whatever troubles befall us, artists will struggle on, fighting the good fight, telling stories and taking us to places of imagination and illumination. As always, the new year offers a range of Australian films to look forward to. Here are 10 of them.
Loveland Director: Ivan Sen Ivan Sen – the director of Mystery Road, Beneath Clouds and Toomelah – behind the wheel of a sumptuous-looking cyberpunk drama set in a futuristic Hong Kong? Yes please! Ryan Kwanten leads the cast as an assassin romantically drawn to a nightclub singer (Jillian Nguyen) and periodically given lecture-like monologues from a scuffy, intellectual-looking Hugo Weaving about loneliness, machines and how he should “walk away while you can”. A line that of course guarantees the protagonist will embark on a perilous journey.
In cinemas 10 February Three Thousand Years of Longing Director: George Miller The great director George Miller is far from prolific, generally helming around two or three major productions a decade. Not much is known about his upcoming fantasy-drama, other than that it involves a British woman who discovers an ancient bottle in Istanbul with a genie inside it that offers her three wishes. The film (starring Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton) must therefore address the old “why not just wish for more wishes?” chestnut. Which we all know is a) a very good wish but b) prohibited by most genies. Seriously Red Director: Gracie Otto
Sometimes, when your career’s on the skids and you’re determined to get your life back on track, the only thing to do is become a Dolly Parton impersonator. Right?! This is the premise of Gracie Otto’s musical dramedy, executive produced by and co-starring Rose Byrne, about a realtor, Red (Krew Boylan), navigating the aforementioned new career with (quoting the official synopsis) “bouncing silicon breasts” and “an intense relationship with a Kenny Rogers impersonator”.
88 Days a Slave Director: Christina Stenseth
The concept of slavery is often relegated to historical discussions, implying we live in a world where it is no longer a problem. Christina Stenseth begs to differ, and has made an observational documentary arguing modern slavery in fact takes place in this very county – on farms where travellers are exploited and underpaid through the Australian government’s working holiday maker program. The Mountain Director: Rolf de Heer
In the first one-and-a-half decades of the new millennium, veteran genre-hopping director Rolf de Heer (Bad Boy Bubby, Dance Me to My Song, Dingo) pumped out eight feature films and one TV documentary – but his output has been scarce in recent years. When I bumped into him recently at a hotel in Adelaide, De Heer assured me he was not retiring; not by a long shot. His next film is about a character named BlackWoman who is abandoned in a cage in the middle of the desert, continuing an array of highly respected films De Heer has made in close collaboration with Indigenous people – including Ten Canoes and Charlie’s Country, starring the late and great David Gulpilil. Blueback Director: Robert Connolly Director Robert Connolly’s latest literary adaptation (his others include The Dry and Barracuda) joins a growing number of films based on Tim Winton books. With a message about preserving the beauty of Australia’s oceans, the story follows a child named Abby (Ilsa Fogg) who becomes besties with a wild groper, thus continuing another trend of homegrown films about people becoming pals with animals and creatures. This is the cinema of Babe, Storm Boy, Red Dog, Oddball and Penguin Bloom. The cast includes Mia Wasikowska, Radha Mitchell and Eric Bana. Gold Director: Anthony Hayes
There’s gold in them thar Zac Efron! No wait: there’s Zac Efron in them thar Gold! In his outback drama, director Anthony Hayes plonks the American heartthrob in the unforgiving Australian desert, where Efron’s drifter character a) finds a very chunky nugget of the good stuff, but b) gets increasingly distraught and frazzled, continuing a line of films in which white people in the desert get burnt like pork chops (see also: Gary Bond in Wake in Fright, Mia Wasikowska in Tracks and David Wenham in The Furnace). In cinemas 13 January; and Stan on 25 January War & Order Director: Larissa Behrendt Larissa Behrendt has carved out a significant niche as a cine-essayist exploring subjects important to Indigenous Australian culture, including in Araatika: Rise Up! (about the creation of an Indigenous Australian haka) and After the Apology (about removal of First Nations kids from their families following Kevin Rudd’s apology to the stolen generations). In War & Order, Behrendt will explore half a century of First Nations activism in Australia and the ways it has been captured by artist Richard Bell. Elvis Director: Baz Luhrmann
The latest display of Extreme Cinematic Excess – also known as “a Baz Luhrmann movie” – made last year’s list of films to look forward to, as did a few others delayed due to the funny old year (understatement of the century) that was 2021. But given Luhrmann movies have a way of soaking up all the attention, a double inclusion feels justified. A teensy-weensy bit of footage from his upcoming Elvis Presley biopic was tweeted by the man himself last month; expect, in the full film, tonnes more glitter. In cinemas 24 June
The Drover’s Wife: The Legend of Molly Johnson Director: Leah Purcell
Like The Nightingale, key themes of Leah Purcell’s feminist western – which reworks Henry Lawson’s short story The Drover’s Wife – include vengeance, gendered violence and class. The film expands on a play Purcell wrote and starred in and also adapted into a novel. Set in the New South Wales Snowy Mountains circa 1893, tough-as-nails protagonist Molly (Leah Purcell) runs a farm and raises four young children in the absence of her drover husband. The plot involves the arrival of an Aboriginal fugitive (Rob Collins) and a multiple murder case for a local police sergeant (Sam Reid, recently in The Newsreader).

5936;5936;When grit isn’t great: letting go rather than pushing through can help our wellbeing |  Gaynor Parkin;2022-01-02T16:30:23Z;['N/A'];['Mental health', 'Psychology', 'Health', 'Health & wellbeing'];"Is it possible to let that go? Is there someone else who can help you? Could you defer it for a week? To each of these queries and other similar ones, Mary gave a firm shake of the head and an even firmer “no”. This was a pattern. Our sessions had a real “groundhog day” feel to them. Mary would arrive looking harassed and tired, tell me how frantic her week had been and how many things there were still to do. We tried problem solving and planning, prioritising and all manner of productivity hacks. Nothing shifted. Mary’s struggle was also too familiar. She reminded me of many other high-achieving people I have worked with who had sought help for exhaustion, or health difficulties or burnout. One of their hallmarks is seemingly endless resources of grit. American psychologist Angela Duckworth is well known for her research on the phenomenon of grit: Grit entails working strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest over years despite failure, adversity and plateaus in progress. Her studies indicate that grit is more predictive of success and achievement in areas like education and business than intelligence or natural ability. Greater grit is associated with people sticking it out through difficult periods and staying longer in a job. Interestingly, research also indicates that those with higher grit are happier and more satisfied with their lives. This finding certainly didn’t hold true for Mary. Is there a downside to too much grit? A 2015 study found that people with high levels of grit often persist with difficult tasks to their own detriment. Participants had to solve as many puzzles as they could – but some of the puzzles were unsolvable. Grittier individuals spent more time attempting to solve unsolvable puzzles and solved fewer overall than their less gritty counterparts. The researchers’ conclusion? There is value in knowing when to quit.
Discussing this knowledge at an intellectual level is one thing. Translating it into a felt sense that some change is possible is much harder. One of the shifts in my work with Mary came after a good discussion about strengths and vulnerabilities. Often we use our strengths to protect ourselves from experiencing our vulnerabilities. Perhaps I over-work to keep feelings of vulnerability at bay, or book myself up with social engagements to avoid noticing I’m feeling alone. It’s smart coping, but it has a downside. Overusing strengths can mean we can rely on them too much, or use them too often, or miss noticing that they are not so helpful any more. Mary’s grit was definitely a strength and it was definitely over used. Gently, to make sure we didn’t trigger too much emotional distress, we brainstormed what the grit might be protecting her from. Mary’s protections again reminded me of other high achievers: protecting her from asking for help; protecting her from feeling vulnerable or not in control; protecting her from feeling that she had somehow failed if she didn’t nail every challenge. Another important insight was helping Mary to recognise that she is living and working in an environment that reinforces grit. Our western culture celebrates the qualities of persistence and striving. We love stories of people triumphing over adversity of all kinds.
We are also quick to criticise anyone who appears to “give up”. The great basketball player Michael Jordan declared: “If you quit once it becomes a habit. Never quit.” Not persevering is seen as the “soft option” or taking the easy road out. For Mary, moving away from too much grit then needed to be an individual journey but also a shared experience. Another young woman I worked with who was a successful athlete gave a presentation on grit to her team and coaches to spark better conversations about persevering and also recovery, when to push and when to pause. When we speak freely about our struggles with family, colleagues and friends, we are better able to identify when someone else, or ourselves, might need a gentle nudge towards pausing instead of pushing. This means we don’t need to walk the path alone. We know from psychological research that we are more likely to succeed and lift our wellbeing with new behaviours if we seek to “add” rather than eliminate (ie set ourselves an “approach” goal rather than an “avoidance” goal). Supporting Mary to practise some active “letting go” , asking for help, learning to ease up on how much she could get done in a day, and to find new hobbies that are more about experiences and being rather than achievements all helped to create some small shifts. And my athlete pulled back from competitions for a period of time to study and have more time with friends. When she returned, her form and performance were better than ever. If you have too much grit, I hope reading this gives you permission to gently check in with yourself (and maybe others). Is this useful for me? When is it not? What else could I do instead? And what other strategies might I learn that enhance my wellbeing rather than deplete it? Interested in how “gritty” you are?

5937;5937;In 2021 I ran 2,000km. It was the first resolution I’d kept longer than two weeks | Benjamin Giles;2022-01-02T16:30:23Z;['N/A'];['Running', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Fitness', 'Coronavirus', 'Australian lifestyle', 'Life and style'];"In the second year of the pandemic I ran 2,000km. This was a big leap from the first year of the pandemic, and the preceding 50 years, during which I’d only ever dragged my dad bod around the same 5km route a few times a week. In running terms I was stagnating, so my New Year’s resolution was to run further and faster. Go Forrest!
To help, I downloaded a running app to track each effort. The GPS recording of times, routes and distances turned into a challenge (obsession) to go faster and beat personal records. I re-read Murakami’s What I Talk About When I Talk About Running and imagined myself following his disciplined daily running routine. Through January and February the runs stretched to 7km and then 8km. By March they included a 10km weekend effort. My legs ached and there were blisters, but I lost weight and my legs strengthened. In April I was running up to 12km. I registered for a June half-marathon. When May came I was doing 15km runs and by the start of June I’d tackled a 20. This gave me confidence I could complete the race. Then the pandemic kicked-off again. With three days to go, the marathon was cancelled as the Sydney lockdown began. So I ran my own half-marathon length on the day and finished in a respectable time. Murakami would be proud.
While exploring my app’s advanced features, I discovered the goal-setting function. Reviewing my the distance I’d already covered, I set a goal of finishing 2,000km by the end of the year. It had a nice round-number sound to it. Lock it in. Working from home during lockdown, my day was structured around a lunch run. With nothing going on, it was always the highlight of my day. I ran the deserted Sydney CBD, down an empty George Street to Circular Quay, past the Opera House, through the Botanic Garden.
As restrictions eased I’d head over the Harbour Bridge or to Bondi, the inner west or Centennial Park. Sometimes I’d run with a friend, but usually it was solo. At first the family feigned interest in where I’d gone each day. I’d tell them what I’d seen, how far I’d run. I’d share my pace and my exertion rate. And then they stopped asking.
On a group run in October, while chatting and distracted I rolled an ankle on a kerb. Pain shot up my leg. I hobbled home and removed my sock to find a swollen foot. By evening it turned purple-black. I retired to the sofa with an ice pack and an exaggerated war story for anyone who’d listen. There were doctor trips and an ultrasound and I was advised to take at least a month of rest. I tried to accept the end of my challenge. In the absence of running I felt stale and sluggish. I scoured running websites for recovery-time advice. Most concurred with the doctor but I kept looking until I found shorter recommendations. Call it stupidity or hope, but three weeks after the injury I was doing short walks and a gentle shuffle. In the absence of searing pain I was back. Building up from short, slow runs, I increased to 5km and then 7km in the first week. With no significant complications I reviewed my challenge: I’d lost a lot of time.
I was way behind the schedule. But I was also obsessed, and it was mathematically possible that by running 11km a day for six weeks, with one rest day a week, I could reach my target on Christmas Eve. This would give me an end-of-year break, and a chance to boast at the family Christmas table. It was back on. By December it was hot and wet. I learnt why running is not a summer sport. The morning runs got earlier to avoid the heat but the humidity was miserable and I was dripping and exhausted. With only one day off a week, the relentless schedule became a chore. When the alarm went off I’d lie there dreading the kilometres I had to run before work. But I also had to do it. And I did. On Christmas Eve I completed my challenge. It was the first New Year’s resolution I’d kept longer than two weeks. To celebrate I did the final run with my sons, who came along for the glory lap. Heading up the last hill, I considered whether to keep going in 2022. But then we rounded the last corner and sprinted home, while I ignored the twinges in my ankle. Two-thousand kilometres sounds like a long way – but it feels even further.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2022/jan/03/in-2021-i-ran-2000km-it-was-the-first-resolution-id-kept-longer-than-two-weeks
5938;5938;A day at the beach: ‘Lots of people saw the flash. They saw me fall and try to get up’;2022-01-02T16:30:22Z;['N/A'];['Life and style', 'Australian lifestyle', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Australia weather', 'Australia news', 'Darwin', 'Northern Territory'];"April Fool’s Day 2015 was just another routine day for us. Late that afternoon I parked the car above Dripstone Cliffs and headed towards Casuarina Beach. Even though you can’t swim in the Northern Territory’s coastal seas because of crocodiles and stingers, I loved the beaches and would run with my Tenterfield terrier, Finn, most evenings. Before letting Finn off his lead, I checked the water for crocs. You can’t be too complacent; dogs have previously been a croc’s dinner here. This was my main concern that evening. Not the approaching storm or getting wet. Storms usually pass as quickly as they come. I remember the storm clouds rolling in, some thunder and lightning from behind us. It didn’t stand out as potentially life-threatening. The remainder was like playing in a rugby game, where you remember running on to the field then waking up concussed, knowing nothing of the game’s final score. I worked as a general paediatrician at Royal Darwin hospital. I woke up there, surrounded by fellow doctors and repeatedly asked them, “Where am I? What happened? Did lightning strike me?” During my night in ICU, I dreamed of being on the beach with Finn, feeling exposed, vulnerable and a bright flash. I don’t recall any other specifics. Thankfully, Finn was safe. He was off his lead and further down the beach.
Over the following weeks, others relayed their recollections. Lots of people were on the beach that night. They saw the flash. Some even felt the ground shudder. They saw me fall and try to get up before collapsing. A medical doctor was running directly behind me. Her quick attendance saved my life. I was resuscitated on the beach before being taken to emergency by ambulance.
Besides my physical signs of a burnt lip and mouth abrasions, they’d picked up a heart arrhythmia and immediately performed CPR. A week later, I broke out in a widespread rash – a delayed reaction to the strike. It looked terrible and was extremely uncomfortable. The doctors and I struggled to find an exact cause. It was either a post-lightning phenomenon, where the lightning strike rattles the bacteria on your skin and you become more susceptible to irritation, or a delayed reaction and an overwhelming stress response to the strike. While it took a few days to settle down, I haven’t had any issues since. Although I only spent a night in ICU, a series of cognitive tests were undertaken with a neuropsychologist, monitoring my heart and brain to ensure there were no lingering effects. I resumed work six weeks later, after the tests returned satisfactory results.
In 2020, I moved to John Hunter Children’s hospital in Newcastle. I grew up in South Africa, and after uni, I applied for jobs in Australia principally because I wanted to enjoy its renowned beaches and surf. Today, Amalia, my three-year-old daughter, and beach activities occupy every spare minute of my time outside work. I know I’m extremely lucky to be alive. I’m still living the Aussie dream. I don’t have any fear or anxiety about storms, because I don’t remember being struck. They also say lightning never strikes twice. I haven’t stopped running on beaches, or in storms. It hasn’t changed my lifestyle, but it has made me assess my life and what’s important. I don’t take anything for granted these days.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/03/a-day-at-the-beach-lots-of-people-saw-the-flash-they-saw-me-fall-and-try-to-get-up
5939;5939;How to move: with rheumatoid arthritis;2022-01-02T16:30:22Z;['N/A'];['Life and style', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Fitness', 'Australian lifestyle'];"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition where your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in and around your joints, causing ongoing inflammation and pain. Some people have arthritis in the small joints of their hands and feet. In others, the inflammation involves major joints, such as the shoulders and the hips. Sometimes just getting out of bed and making it through the day with rheumatoid arthritis may feel like all you can manage. “But humans are designed to move,” says Dr Daniel Lewis, a rheumatologist and chronic pain specialist.
He says every system of the body – from the endocrine system to the nervous system, the musculoskeletal system, the sleep-wake cycle and mental health – is influenced by how physically active we are. “When you stop moving, systems start to collapse,” he says. “Movement encourages the natural healing function of the body – if you rest, you rust.” Errol Lim, a physiotherapist and the managing director of BJC Health, says that in the early stages of the disease, exercise can help prevent worsening of the joints. In more advanced stages, exercise can help reduce stiffness and pain. It can also improve mood and self-confidence. “There is no form of arthritis that won’t benefit from exercise, and a form of exercise can be found for every individual, irrespective of the pattern of their arthritis,” Lewis says. “Age is no barrier.” Activities like strength training and low-impact workouts can help relieve the pain. Here is a simple guide that can help you get moving, but it is always best to seek advice from a physiotherapist before you begin an exercise program. The class: hydrotherapy Hydrotherapy can be beneficial in treating rheumatoid arthritis, particularly when the pain makes exercising a challenge. It involves a series of exercises that generally focus on slow, controlled movements done in a warm-water pool. The water temperature is usually 34ºC, warmer than a typical swimming pool. The water supports your weight, and the warmth allows your muscles to relax and eases the pain in your joints, helping you exercise.
The water also provides some resistance to moving your joints. By pushing your arms and legs against the water, you can improve your muscle strength. The move: the deadlift Everyone could benefit from the deadlift exercise, Lim suggests. “That’s a really functional position for all of us,” he says. “That’s how we lift children, how we lift our luggage, the box from the boot of our car, the six bottles of wine that we carry back from the supermarket.” Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands just outside your legs. Travel your hands along your thighs as you bend your knees and hips, keeping the spine straight. Then slowly lift by straightening the legs, as if you are picking up something from the floor. Lim recommends beginning with this simple movement and then progressing by increasing the number of repetitions or adding lightweights. “It’s a very slow progression.” The deadlift forces you to grip, recruiting the wrist, forearm and shoulder muscles. “A significant percentage of people with rheumatoid arthritis have issues with their upper back and neck,” Lim says. “This particular exercise can help with that.” The activity: dancing Dancing can be a fun activity to keep the body moving. Dancing can help improve blood circulation and lubricate your joints, improving flexibility. It also releases serotonin and endorphins in your brain, which lift your mood and help prevent the mental health issues often associated with a chronic disease.
A morning playlist can help you move through gentle dance moves to relieve the morning stiffness most people with rheumatoid arthritis experience.
Dancing does not need to be vigorous. Small, rhythmic movements that follow your favourite tune can still offer the joy of dance without putting too much pressure on the joints. Lim says he was surprised to find that dancing is very popular among his patients. “It’s the music, and people love moving with it.” The hard pass: don’t overdo it Lewis says people with rheumatoid arthritis should avoid exercises that aggravate pain or make it last into the next day. “It’s about finding the movement that allows people to function and keep their body moving, but not flare up.” “We spend a lot of time teaching our patients how to do appropriate pacing,” says Lim, “and staging the amount of activity they do throughout the week. We teach them how to listen to their body so that they know they’re not over-pushing it.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/03/how-to-move-with-rheumatoid-arthritis
5940;5940;Easy wins: give speeches? No way. My not-to-do list gives me the power to say no ;2022-01-02T16:30:22Z;['Tory Shepherd'];['Life and style', 'Health & wellbeing'];"Sorry? Bugger that. It’s “no” that always seems to be the hardest word. Every time I look at my diary for the upcoming week, there is at least one entry that triggers the thought: “Why did I say yes to that?” It’s a common problem among my many people-pleasing friends. It’s like a pokies hit. Someone asks a favour, you say “yes”, you get a smile in return. Ka-ching! Good feelings. Until the dreaded thing looms in the calendar and the good feelings disappear like coins into a slot machine. As with all personal problems that have an easy answer (say “no”), I overthought the issue, catastrophised about the consequences of turning things down, and ultimately researched the shit out of it.
I read productivity books (well, listened to the condensed versions on Blinkist, because who has the time?). I looked at the habits of effective people, thought fast and slow about life hacks, tried to learn the subtle art of not giving a fuck. I cogitated on all the hints, tips and tricks that people have written entire books about, and came up with two things that have been helping me ever since. No 1: Write a not-to-do list. The not-to-do list is potentially endless, but for the purposes of saying “no”, should be kept to things you are asked to do by those who would suck your very soul from your body. Mine includes things like “give speeches”, “drive long distances to catch up with people whose conversation is only bearable with copious amounts of wine”, and “work for free”. It helps crystallise in my mind the things I am allowed to say no to. Sorry, I don’t do speeches. I don’t do long drives (I usually leave off the bit about the conversations). I don’t work for free. It’s still not easy, but having the list at least gives me pause before “sure, I’d love to” trips off my traitorous tongue. No 2: Ask “would I want to do that tonight?” This is handy for all the other requests that have not yet made it on to the not-to-do list. It’s about being nicer to Future Tory.
See, I suffer from peoplepleasia to an extent, but my larger problem is an entirely misplaced optimism about the capacity of Future Tory. Today Tory, when asked to commit to something in the hazy future, firmly believes that Future Tory will have her life in order by that point. Future Tory will have boundless energy and limitless time to spend on things other people want her to do. Future Tory, when she sees what Today Tory has committed her to, generally thinks Today Tory is a bitch. So now, when someone asks if I’d like to pop along to their crochet circle in a month and give a talk about defamation law, I think of Future Tory, and I ask myself if I’d say “yes” if the crochet circle was tonight. The answer is, almost invariably, “no”.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/03/easy-wins-a-not-to-do-list-of-things-im-allowed-to-say-no-to
5941;5941;Australia’s Covid positive test rate: why is it rising and what does it really mean?;2022-01-02T16:30:22Z;['Michael McGowan'];['Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Australia news', 'Omicron variant', 'Health'];"As Covid-19 case numbers have continued to rise following the arrival of the Omicron variant alongside the easing of restrictions in Australia, the focus has begun to turn to the positivity testing rate. In New South Wales, where the rise in cases has been steepest, the infection rate as a proportion of the population is now one of the highest in the world. By New Year’s Eve the rate of infection was about 2.59 per 1,000 people, higher than the United States. As cases have risen, so too has the positivity rate, which by Sunday had reached 20% in NSW. Other states have also experienced a steady increase in the ratio of positive cases. In Tasmania it reached 26% on Sunday, Victoria’s was 14.8% and Queensland’s 10.5%.
So what is the positivity rate? And what does it tell us about the spread of the virus as evidence of Omicron’s milder severity continues to mount and governments try to shift the focus away from case numbers? What is the positivity rate? The positivity rate of infection is the number of positive cases of Covid as a proportion of the number of PCR tests carried out. For example, a positivity rate of 20% in NSW means one in five people whose tests were processed in the reporting period had the virus. The figure doesn’t tell us how many cases are circulating in the community, but it can help to understand how many of the likely cases are being picked up. That, according to Alexandra Martiniuk, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Sydney, was particularly true at the beginning of the pandemic. “In general, the lower the positivity level, the more likely we think we’re catching, if not all, then most of the cases in the community,” she said. “As it rises you think we’re likely missing cases, and the more it goes up we’re likely to be missing more and more.” Why is it rising so quickly? Martiniuk says that throughout the Covid pandemic, the reliability of the positivity rate has been affected by testing levels, and the policies dictating who gets tested and who doesn’t. She uses the example of Malawi, where she previously worked as a representative for the World Health Organization. Throughout the pandemic that country did very little population testing, limiting it to people who presented at emergency departments. In Australia, policy changes may be affecting the positivity rate. Recent changes to Covid-19 testing policies have seen governments ask people not to get tested unless they are symptomatic or fit a new and narrower definition of a close contact. As test numbers begin to fall, as they did on Sunday, it’s likely that the positivity rate will increase. “It’s like we had this bigger bag which contained all the people we have now, but also a lot of other people. People who might have been a casual contact, or who fit the old definition of a close contact, or who might have had very mild symptoms,” she said. “So now our bag is smaller so that we just have those symptomatic people and the very close contacts. So we may be missing those other people.”
The positivity rate can also be affected by other things, such as the Christmas and new year holiday period. While the NSW positivity rate was 20% on Sunday, the seven-day average was about 10%. Does it matter? Certainly for scientists trying to understand how the virus is spreading, it is a figure worth watching. As Martiniuk puts it, for people seeking to respond to the pandemic, data “is like the flight path”. “Without it you’re flying blind.” And while changes to testing may affect the number of cases being caught, she said it was also important to recognise the need to focus resources. “I’m not so silly as to think we’re not in the situation that we’re in,” she said. “I think epidemiologists recognise times are changing and they need to and it’s both good and bad at the same time. We are having a resource issue and there’s no way we could PCR test everyone with Omicron. “PCRs need to get turned around faster because a lot of the treatments are needed in the first five days, so particularly vulnerable people need to know their status.” So as the focus of the pandemic shifts so that case numbers are no longer the focus of government, is it still relevant? As the positivity rate in Australia has climbed, some have pointed to the World Health Organization’s declaration that a positivity rate of 5% and under is evidence of spread that is under control. But that declaration was made towards the beginning of the pandemic in May 2020. At that point, governments were still seeking to control the virus, while Australia was trying to suppress it, or in some states, eradicate it. “Test positivity still has value, as in the metric is still valuable, but the benchmark of 5%, I’m not sure,” Martiniuk said. “I think obviously if a country is at 5% that’s great, it is a good indicator that their local pandemic is under control, but whether it’s achievable for most countries to aim for that at this point is another question.” However that doesn’t mean people should believe the pandemic is over. “We still need to test and we still need to go back to that 2020 thinking of bending the curve so if someone is really sick they can get the care the need. I think that message has been lost a little bit. “We still need testing to stop those chains of transmission even though it does feel overwhelming.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/australias-covid-positive-test-rate-why-is-it-rising-and-what-does-it-really-mean
5942;5942;Stuart Dallas and Dan James power Leeds to victory over struggling Burnley;2022-01-02T16:09:24Z;['Aaron Bower'];['Premier League', 'Leeds United', 'Burnley', 'Football', 'Sport'];"The new year may only be hours old, but here was a game to suggest Leeds United and Burnley could be moving in different directions in the months ahead. For Leeds this pressure-relieving result will have reinforced what their most optimistic supporters always believed: that the team had the quality and mettle to drag themselves away from a relegation battle this season. This result does not make things guaranteed in that regard. But a gap of eight points between Leeds and the bottom three offers hope that Marcelo Bielsa and his side can now tentatively look up the table, rather than glancing over their shoulders at the sides below them.
Had the home side failed to capitalise on their dominance against Burnley, the questions which have already been levied at Bielsa’s players on numerous occasions this season would have resurfaced. Perhaps that is why Bielsa, so often a master of keeping his emotions in check, could not help himself when he enthusiastically embraced members of his coaching staff when Dan James finally put this result beyond doubt with his injury-time goal. That made it 3-1 in Leeds’s favour, and in truth the result and the margin of the win did not flatter the hosts. “It was a fair victory, and the difference was also fair,” Bielsa said afterwards, while also calling on his side to use this new-found momentum moving forward. “I don’t ignore the situation that we are in. In football, you have to prove yourself every week and even if the performance today was a step forward, we need to maintain that level of performance against any opponent and on any pitch.” Bielsa’s side led 1-0 at half-time and, just like the final outcome, it was no less than they deserved at that stage. Having enjoyed the better of the chances in the first half, the goal Leeds’s play merited came when Jack Harrison scored on the rebound after his initial strike was saved by Wayne Hennessey. Had Tyler Roberts done better with a Luke Ayling cross he headed wide of Hennessey’s goal, the hosts could have even been out of sight by half-time.
It was fast becoming a case of when, not if, Sean Dyche called for Maxwel Cornet to inspire his side as he has done so often already this season. The change came at the interval and within nine minutes of the restart the Ivorian had dragged his side level with a wonderful curling free-kick. It was Cornet’s sixth goal in only 11 Premier League appearances, and as he prepares to head to the Africa Cup of Nations for potentially the next month, it is tempting to wonder just how entrenched in the relegation quagmire Burnley could be upon the Ivorian’s return. Cornet’s influence on this side is without question. How do Burnley cope without him? That is a pressing question to which Dyche must find the answer this month in the transfer window. “They had a little bit more edge against us today with that desire,” the Burnley manager said. “They had a physical will to go and take on the game, even in times they weren’t playing well. “All these details eventually, if they go in the melting pot, they’re going to hurt you: and we hurt ourselves.” Cornet’s free-kick was a moment of brilliance, the latest the 25-year-old has delivered in a Burnley shirt. It sparked enthusiastic celebrations from the travelling players in front of the Leeds supporters before Matthew Lowton was struck by a bottle. Paul Tierney had pleaded with the Burnley players not to celebrate at the home end but, regardless of that, the fact Lowton required medical attention underlined what a mindless act it was from the supporter – if you can call him that – in question.
Leeds regrouped from that setback though and, freshened by the introduction of James and Joe Gelhardt from the bench, went back ahead when a clever short corner found its way to Stuart Dallas. His magnificent strike left Hennessey flatfooted as it curled into the corner to put the hosts 2-1 in front, before Leeds finally added the killer touch in stoppage time. How pleasing it must have been for Bielsa to see two substitutes combine for the third, as Gelhardt’s cross was met by the head of James. Hennessey parried it, but could not keep it out, sparking wild celebrations inside Elland Road. Perhaps the home supporters, much like Bielsa judging by his own reaction, can sense the tide may be turning as 2022 begins.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/leeds-burnley-premier-league-match-report
5943;5943;Gerrard fumes after Roerslev and Brentford catch Aston Villa on rebound;2022-01-02T16:06:00Z;['Nick Ames'];['Premier League', 'Brentford', 'Aston Villa', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Brentford got their ball back, although it needed an almighty wrestle. After Manchester City won here on Wednesday, Ivan Toney likened their thankless chasing of possession to being robbed by “year 11s” in a playground kickabout. Here the striker was similarly peripheral but it proved immaterial because, through persistence and sheer bloody-mindedness, his side confounded most of the afternoon’s evidence with a comeback win that makes their new-year outlook decidedly sunnier. In doing so they leapfrogged Aston Villa, who will kick themselves at letting this slip. It was not that Steven Gerrard’s players ran Brentford ragged, it was more that, after taking the lead when a piece of magic from Emiliano Buendía set up Danny Ings, they failed to build on their advantage despite broadly dominating the entire game. They were entirely untroubled until Yoane Wissa brilliantly levelled shortly before half‑time and, although that pattern persisted for most of the second period, they did not open up their opponents nearly enough to make their territory count.
Emboldened, Brentford found a new lease of life as the clock ticked down. They served Villa a warning when Frank Onyeka drew a marvellous save from Emiliano Martínez and, seven minutes from time, found their hero. Mads Roerslev has been a deputy for much of his time at Brentford and, at 22, has made a modest 32 career starts. He had a convincing game at right wing-back, though, and had already teed up Wissa’s leveller when Shandon Baptiste found him in space on the right of the box. Martínez parried his first effort but had no chance from the emphatically converted rebound. It was the Dane’s first goal at senior level. “It’s a fantastic Brentford story, classic us, bringing in a young player that hadn’t played a full season for anyone,” Thomas Frank said of Roerslev, who joined in 2019 after failing to break through at FC Copenhagen. “He’s growing. He got an assist and an even better goal today.” Frank had been perplexed by Brentford’s performance in the first 43 minutes, finding them sluggish and fretting about their body language. “We were low on everything, quality and energy, in the first half,” he said, and it appeared Villa would make them pay. After a scrappy opening phase Buendía stepped up to provide a reminder of the quality he has rarely shown since joining from Norwich for £30m last summer.
To the less imaginative eye there was little on when Buendía took a return pass from Douglas Luiz 10 yards inside Brentford’s half. Christian Nørgaard was quickly at his back but the Argentinian was just too smart, losing his opponent in one movement with a giddying two-touch spin and drag back. Now the hosts’ defence was exposed and Buendía made no mistake, supplying Ings with the type of delicately weighted through-ball that earned him renown at Carrow Road. The finish across Álvaro Fernández was impeccable and Villa should have pushed on from there. “Big time,” Gerrard said when asked if they had missed an opportunity. “I couldn’t believe we were level at half-time, I was scratching my head. It was a matter of when the second goal would come.”
The fact was, though, that beyond a rising drive from John McGinn, the visitors had not come especially close to scoring it. Perhaps they missed Ollie Watkins, who was denied a reunion with his old club due to an unspecified problem. Brentford had offered nothing beyond a wayward swipe from Mathias Jensen but, when the midfielder exchanged passes with Roerslev, Villa backed off and provided an opening. There was still plenty to do: Roerslev found the onrushing Wissa, who cajoled the ball on to his left foot with a smart touch and curled it past Martínez from inside the D.
“Sometimes you need that moment of magic in a game where it wasn’t working,” Frank said. It enlivened the crowd but Brentford, already cursing a lengthy injury list, lost Jensen and Sergi Canós to knocks after the break. They were more competitive but remained on the back foot even though Villa seemed light on ideas. Then Onyeka seized the initiative by forcing Martínez to tip onto his left post and, while Ings planted a free header at Fernández in response, there was a visible opportunity for Brentford. Roerslev took it and Gerrard fumed. “They’ve had three good attacks and scored two goals, it’s not good enough from our point of view,” he said. “If you lose your grit, your fight and your aggression to stop conceding goals it’s going to leave you vulnerable.” Villa belatedly worked Fernández through Ings and Buendía, while the substitute Trezeguet shamed his club by attempting to bail them out with a disgraceful dive in added time. It was too late; Gerrard faced the most disappointing defeat of his short reign while Brentford, amid the rough and tumble of the schoolyard, continue to mix it with the big boys.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/brentford-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report
5944;5944;Never mind England’s misery, celebrate Australia’s Ashes brilliance | Sam Perry;2022-01-02T16:00:21Z;['Sam Perry'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'The Ashes', 'Australia cricket team', 'England cricket team', 'Cricket', 'Sport', 'Australia sport'];"Have Australia been good or have England been bad? Obviously, this is the only way to analyse the Ashes. And it allows us to fling open the door to a frenzy of sizzling takes through its zero sum, binary veneer.
“Hapless England” certainly makes for engaging copy. Not only can we pick at the carcass of an on-field humiliation, but we can opine on the macro social, cultural and economic forces that shape Haseeb Hameed’s low hands. It allows David Warner to gift advice on syntho preparation. The Barmy Army can become cricket’s version of an industry lobbyist. And while “Chris Cooke bowling spells the death of Test cricket” might offer a lively conversation point, it conveniently ignores the fact he actually hoops them. It is also true, though unpopular, to say that Australia have been good. Six weeks ago this was a team that had more questions hovering over it than Prince Andrew. David Warner was turning 35. The young prodigy deigned to partner him had withdrawn, and the alternatives failed to inspire. Steve Smith hadn’t dominated for a while. Marnus Labuschagne was due a downturn. There was a yawning gap in the middle order. Cameron Green was an all-rounder without a wicket. The frontline bowlers didn’t deliver last summer. The team hadn’t played in nearly a year. The rare units of the triumphant T20 team weren’t around to offset the coach. If England could just apply some pressure, would the team return to old dynamics? Then the skipper resigned amid scandal. We chin-stroked over a bowling captain, irrespective of his eyes and his blazer fitting just-so. We weren’t used to new keepers. For a cricketing nation welded to a tradition of conservatism and incumbency, there was a fair bit of flux. These were conditions ripe for a surprise. Instead, the Ashes were secured in twelve days.
Beyond the influence of white balls and private schools on England’s cricket, the component parts of Australia’s victory are worth exploring. Most significantly, every single player involved has contributed something meaningful to a win. This is important, because it illustrates a team with a complete working configuration, rare for Australia in modern times. Previous series wins, however close or dominant, tended to happen on the back of one or two outsized contributions, particularly with the bat. Warner against Pakistan. labuschagne against New Zealand. Smith in England. Here, every incumbent has firmed their grip on their position. Warner navigated the Gabba with a grizzled opener’s maturity, before an altogether more complete contribution in Adelaide. Labuschagne did the same, but in the reverse fixture. Smith almost capped a return to the captaincy with a century. Travis Head upended a rare moment of English pressure with a violent, match-winning hundred. Cameron Green graduated from gun-barrel to gun with the ball. Alex Carey has twice played the sort of brisk, keeper’s innings to close the door on opposition opportunity. He’s also gloved the ball well enough and eschewed the stardom of the stump mic. Of the batters, last to join the party was Marcus Harris. He was retained by selectors in Melbourne despite growing calls for change, and responded with an innings of 76 runs from 190 balls, outstripping the entire opposition’s second innings for balls faced. This was a match-winning innings, yet in some quarters it merely cemented views on Harris’s low ceiling. There is a unique phenomenon in Australia, possibly born of the pathways ideology, where we regard players for their future, not current, output, but Harris’ innings would’ve warmed the hardest opener’s heart, and seasoned eyes understand these types of knocks are vital to the consistency of any outfit. Australia will need more of these. Not least because they ensure bowlers always have something to work with. “The Cartel” have been irrepressible, with hard statistics showing their rewards aren’t simply a function of English ineptitude. For many years track-suited coaches have been wont to say that bowling is a closed skill, and CricViz’s Freddie Wilde gave Australia’s efforts some teeth, noting that, “Australia’s bowling in the Ashes has been the best in a 3+ match series in our ball-tracking database. No team on record has bowled as fast (38% above 140kph) & as accurately (41% on good line & length).”
The world class operators have delivered, and each understudy has impressed. Where Scott Boland’s spirit soared after he stood on the shoulders of his ancestral giants, it was also reward for years and years of pounding the bitumen-esque Junction Oval with hard length after hard length. There is harmony in the unit too. There has been no macho bullshit, yet. The leadership dynamics overseeing present life are not yet clear, but one suspects the rising influence of calm heads like George Bailey, Tony Dodemaide, Michael Di Venuto, Andrew McDonald and Pat Cummins have helped. Justin Langer – whether through direction or design – has permitted this and must be afforded credibility for doing so. It begs an awkward question: what does Langer do now? To be fair to him, whatever it is (or isn’t), it’s working. Cummins will be the key voice in his renewal. For now, the going is good, and the Australian cricketing public is rightly accepting the home Ashes opiate, because like England, the home country has its own systemic problems ready to be revealed once stronger opponents line up in less homely conditions. That’s when when we’ll learn more about the merits of this perennial “almost-team”, as they ready themselves for another trip to explore the summit.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/never-mind-englands-misery-celebrate-australias-ashes-brilliance

A 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder late on Saturday and is being held at a south London police station, the Metropolitan police said. Another 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder on Friday and has since been released on bail until a date in late January. The killing of Zaian marked the 29th teenage homicide in London in 2021, a total that now stands at 30 after a 16-year-old was killed in west London less than an hour later. It is the city’s worst ever annual death toll from teenage homicides. Zaian died at the scene of the attack in Ashburton Park in Croydon shortly after 7.30pm on Thursday. Police said a postmortem examination gave the cause of death as a stab wound to the heart. DCI Richard Leonard made a direct appeal on Saturday for information about the local boy’s death. He said: “My team are continuing to work around the clock so that we can give Zaian’s family the answers they deserve. “No matter how insignificant you may think it, if you have information that can help, you must do the right thing and contact us immediately.” A 16-year-old boy in Yiewsley, west London, who has yet to be named, was the victim of the second fatal stabbing on Thursday.

5946;5946;What impact will Omicron have on UK children and schools?;2022-01-02T15:39:44Z;['Nicola Davis'];['Coronavirus', 'Omicron variant', 'Schools', 'UK news', 'England', 'Wales', 'Scotland', 'Northern Ireland', 'Education', 'Nadhim Zahawi', 'Office for National Statistics'];As a new term is set to start for schools across the UK and the government announces masks will return for secondary pupils in England’s classrooms, we take a look at the potential impact of Omicron on children. How prevalent is Covid among children? According to case data for the week to 27 December 2021 – which is based on infections picked up by testing – rates are currently highest among young adults. However, rates per 100,000 people are also high among children, at 1,126.5 for those aged 10 to 14, and 836.2 for those aged five to nine. Further insights come from the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, revealing that in the week ending 23 December infection levels in England were highest among those aged two to Year 6 and those aged 25 to 34, at about one in 15 people for both groups. An estimated one in 20 of secondary school-aged children to Year 11 in England had Covid in the same week, compared with one in 45 of those aged 50 to 69 and one in 100 of those aged 70 and over. Is Omicron more dangerous to children? Early reports from South Africa raised concerns that may be the case. However, a preliminary analysis by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) based on the situation in England has suggested a lower risk of hospitalisation among Omicron cases in school-age children compared with Delta cases. While the findings are good news, experts have stressed some children can still become sick from Covid and require hospital care, while there are also concerns about the potential impact of long Covid. Which children are eligible to be vaccinated against Covid? Two doses of the Covid jab have been recommended for all those aged 12 to 17 in the UK, with some offered an additional jab, for example if they are severely immunosuppressed. A booster dose has recently been announced for all 16- to 17-year-olds and some children aged 12 to 15, such as those who are in a clinical risk group. Last month the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said that two Covid jabs would also be made available for clinically vulnerable five- to 11-year-olds, as well as those living with someone who is immunosuppressed. The doses will be a third of the quantity used for adults. What about testing? Educational staff and secondary school pupils in Scotland, Northern Ireland and England are asked to take two lateral flow tests a week, while in Wales they have been asked to take three. “Testing remains voluntary but is strongly encouraged,” guidance from the Department for Education states, adding that secondary schools should also retain capacity to carry out asymptomatic testing on-site for pupils who are unable to test themselves at home. Concerns have been raised about the availability of lateral flow tests, with those attempting to request kits online in recent days having repeatedly been faced with messages stating “no home delivery slots left”, and some pharmacies also running out. However, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, has said schools will have their own supplies of lateral flow tests. What other measures are in place in schools? This varies from country to country. However, there are common approaches, including an emphasis on hygiene and sanitation. On Saturday it was announced that secondary school pupils in England should return to wearing masks in classrooms, not just communal areas, a measure already in place in the other countries of the UK. While Robert Halfon, the chair of the House of Commons education select committee, has raised concerns, including saying that there is very limited evidence of the efficacy of masks in educational settings, others have backed the measure, pointing out that while masks are not perfect, and their effectiveness depends on their quality, a number of studies have suggested mask-wearing in schools is linked to smaller increases in case rates and a lower likelihood of outbreaks. Zahawi has also announced that nurseries, schools and colleges would be given 7,000 more air cleaning units in a bid to improve ventilation, a move the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, Mary Bousted, said would be “completely inadequate”. Will schools have to close? Zahawi has said he will do “everything in his power” to protect education. However, some experts have said more should be done. “The fact that children [in England] who are household members of a case are mandated to come into school, and children sitting next to a case in a classroom are not even considered close contacts, suggests that policies are geared towards maximising transmission rather than protecting children and their families,” Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist at Queen Mary University of London, told the Guardian. Another key issue is staffing, given the level of absences because of Covid and self-isolation, with ex-teachers being encouraged to return – although there are doubts this will happen in time for the new term in England. It seems likely that at least some teaching will be done remotely, with Zahawi urging schools to implement a flexible approach to learning where necessary, to maximise on-site education.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/what-impact-will-omicron-have-on-uk-children-and-schools-covid-england-classrooms

Images broadcast on television showed flames leaping from the roof of one large building, while several others in the parliament precinct including the National Assembly were enveloped in a thick cloud of black smoke. The fire is believed to have started in one of the older buildings in the precinct, leading to a security cordon near the cathedral where the ashes of the anti-apartheid hero Archbishop Desmond Tutu were buried on Saturday. “The roof of the Old Assembly building has collapsed and is gone,” said JP Smith, Cape Town’s mayoral committee member for safety and security. No casualties had been reported and the cause of the blaze was not yet known.
President Cyril Ramaphosa told reporters at the scene an arrest had been made. “Someone has been held right now and is being questioned,” he said. A team of 30 firefighters who first arrived at the scene battled the flames for several hours before being forced to retreat and call for reinforcements.About 80 firefighters were later deployed, some using a crane to spray water on the blaze. The fire broke out at about 0300 GMT on Sunday. The National Assembly building, which has a red and white facade, is where South Africa’s last apartheid president, FW de Klerk, declared the end of the brutal white minority regime in 1990. The area around the fire in the upmarket neighbourhood was quickly cordoned off. The cordon stretched to a square where flowers were still displayed in front of the nearby St George’s Cathedral, where Tutu’s funeral took place on Saturday. After a simple mass, with a cheap coffin – according to the famously modest Tutu’s instructions – his ashes were interred in the cathedral on Sunday. Cape Town is home to South Africa’s seat of parliament, including the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, while the government is based in Pretoria. The Houses of Parliament in Cape Town consist of three sections, including the original and oldest building that was completed in 1884. The newer additions, constructed in the 1920s and 1980s, house the National Assembly.

5949;5949;‘There is no money left’: Covid crisis leaves Sri Lanka on brink of bankruptcy;2022-01-02T15:00:20Z;['Hannah Ellis-Petersen'];['Sri Lanka', 'Food security', 'South and central Asia', 'World news', 'Global development', 'Global economy', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Coronavirus', 'Society'];"Sri Lanka is facing a deepening financial and humanitarian crisis with fears it could go bankrupt in 2022 as inflation rises to record levels, food prices rocket and its coffers run dry. The meltdown faced by the government, led by the strongman president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, is in part caused by the immediate impact of the Covid crisis and the loss of tourism but is compounded by high government spending and tax cuts eroding state revenues, vast debt repayments to China and foreign exchange reserves at their lowest levels in a decade. Inflation has meanwhile been spurred by the government printing money to pay off domestic loans and foreign bonds. The World Bank estimates 500,000 people have fallen below the poverty line since the beginning of the pandemic, the equivalent of five years’ progress in fighting poverty. Inflation hit a record high of 11.1% in November and escalating prices have left those who were previously well off struggling to feed their families, while basic goods are now unaffordable for many. After Rajapaksa declared Sri Lanka to be in an economic emergency, the military was given power to ensure essential items, including rice and sugar, were sold at set government prices – but it has done little to ease people’s woes.
Anurudda Paranagama, a chauffeur in the capital, Colombo, took on a second job to pay for rising food costs and cover the loan on his car but it was not enough. “It is very difficult for me to repay the loan. When I have to pay electricity and water bills and spend on food, there is no money left,” he said, adding that his family now eats two meals a day instead of three. He described how his village grocer was opening 1kg packets of milk powder and dividing it into packs of 100g because his customers could not afford the whole packet. “We now buy 100g of beans when we used to buy 1kg for the week,” said Paranagama. The loss of jobs and vital foreign revenue from tourism, which usually contributes more than 10% of GDP, has been substantial, with more than 200,000 people losing their livelihoods in the travel and tourism sectors, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. The situation has got so bad that long queues have formed at the passport office as one in four Sri Lankans, mostly the young and educated, say they want to leave the country. For older citizens, it is reminiscent of the early 1970s when import controls and low production at home caused severe shortages of basic commodities and caused long queues for bread, milk and rice.
The former central bank deputy governor WA Wijewardena warned the struggles of ordinary people would exacerbate the financial crisis, which would in turn make life harder for them. “When the economic crisis deepens beyond redemption, it is inevitable that the country will have a financial crisis too,” he said. “Both will reduce food security by lowering production and failing to import due to foreign exchange scarcities. At that point, it will be a humanitarian crisis.” One of the most pressing problems for Sri Lanka is its huge foreign debt burden, in particular to China. It owes China more than $5bn in debt and last year took an additional $1bn loan from Beijing to help with its acute financial crisis, which is being paid in instalments. In the next 12 months, in the government and private sector, Sri Lanka will be required to repay an estimated $7.3bn in domestic and foreign loans, including a $500m international sovereign bond repayment in January. However, as of November, available foreign currency reserves were just $1.6bn. In an usual approach, government minister Ramesh Pathirana said they hoped to settle their past oil debts with Iran by paying them with tea, sending them $5m worth of tea every month in order to save “ much needed currency”. The opposition MP and economist Harsha de Silva recently told parliament that foreign currency reserves would be -$437m by January next year, while the total foreign debt to service would be $4.8bn from February to October 2022. “The nation will be totally bankrupt,” he said. Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal made public assurances that Sri Lanka could pay off its debts “seamlessly” but Wijewardena said the country was at substantial risk of defaulting on its repayments, which would have catastrophic economic consequences. Meanwhile, Rajapaksa’s sudden decision in May to ban all fertiliser and pesticides and force farmers to go organic without warning has brought a formerly prosperous agricultural community to its knees as many farmers, who had become used to using – and often overusing – fertiliser and pesticides, were suddenly left without ways to produce healthy crops or combat weeds and insects. Many fearing a loss decided not to cultivate crops at all, adding to the food shortages in Sri Lanka.
The government made a dramatic U-turn in late October and farmers are now struggling to cover the high costs of imported fertiliser without help. “The costs of cultivating paddy [rice] have gone up astronomically … The government has no money for fertiliser subsidies. Many of us farmers are reluctant to invest money because we don’t know if we will make any profit,” said one farmer, Ranjit Hulugalle. In an attempt temporarily to ease the problems and stave off difficult and most likely unpopular policies, the government has resorted to temporary relief measures, such as credit lines to import foods, medicines and fuel from its neighbouring ally India, as well as currency swaps from India, China and Bangladesh and loans to purchase petroleum from Oman. However, these loans provide only short-term relief and have to be paid back quickly at high interest rates, adding to Sri Lanka’s debt load. Anushka Shanuka, a personal trainer, was among those who used to have a comfortable life but now is struggling to get by. “We can’t live the way we used to before the pandemic,” he said, saying the prices of vegetables had gone up by more than 50%. “The government promised to help us but nothing came, so we are just managing the best we can. I don’t know how much longer we can go on like this.” • This article was amended on 6 January 2022. “Cultivating paddy” refers to rice, not wheat as an earlier version said.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/covid-crisis-sri-lanka-bankruptcy-poverty-pandemic-food-prices
5950;5950;Crypto tycoons help drive global art market to record levels in 2021;2022-01-02T15:00:20Z;['Harriet Sherwood'];['The art market', 'Art', 'Art and design', 'Painting', 'Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)', 'Sculpture', 'Cryptocurrencies', 'Culture', 'World news', 'UK news', 'Technology'];"The global art market performed at record levels in 2021, with billions of dollars being paid for works by impressionist, postwar and contemporary artists, and much of it bought by people whose wealth comes from cryptocurrencies or other technologies. More than $2.6bn (£2bn) of art was sold in two weeks by leading auction houses in New York in November. Four works by Vincent van Gogh sold for $161m, including $71.4m paid for Wooden Huts Among Olive Trees and Cypress Trees. In May, Jean-Michel Basquiat’s 1983 2-metre-tall painting In This Case became 2021’s single most expensive painting to change hands when it sold for $93m. The sale in November of 35 works from the Macklowe Collection – by Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, among others – totalled more than $676m. Landscape by Nicolas Party went for $3.2m, doubling the Swiss artist’s previous record.
“The art market is certainly frothy. And I think the audience for art is larger than it’s ever been. We’re seeing record levels in the 277-year history of our company,” said Charles Stewart, the chief executive officer of auction house Sotheby’s. Art market experts say demand that was pent up in 2020 by the global Covid pandemic has released at the same time as sought-after artworks are being put up for sale. “There has been an extraordinarily high level of quality material coming to the market and that has drawn the attention of buyers,” said Stewart. It is not only paintings that are commanding enormous sums. Last month, the Hamilton Aphrodite, a Roman sculpture dating back to the first or second century AD, established a new world record for an ancient marble sculpture when it sold in New York for almost $25m, smashing its pre-sale estimate of $2m-$3m. Luxury auctions at Sotheby’s – including streetwear and skateboard decks as well as jewellery, watches, handbags, wines and whiskey – totalled more than $1bn for the first time in 2021. And a non-fungible token (NFT) of Everydays: the First 5,000 Days by Mike Winkelmann, the digital artist known as Beeple, sold for a record $69m in March, making him “among the top three most valuable living artists”, according to Christie’s. “It’s true that the market is performing at record levels, and certainly outperforming most people’s expectations,” said Katharine Arnold, the head of postwar and contemporary art at Christie’s.
However, the market for old masters was less buoyant, with sales at auctions last month down almost 20% on comparable sales two years ago. According to the 2021 Contemporary Art Market Report, $2.7bn worth of contemporary art was sold at auction in the 12 months to June, representing a “stronger, more diverse and denser market than ever before”. Experts attribute the booming market to at least three factors, which may overlap: young “crypto-driven” buyers; the growth in the Asian market; and the belief that art is a good investment at a time of economic uncertainty. People who have made fortunes from cryptocurrencies and other technologies “are now participating at very high levels”, said Stewart. “They are young and they are global.” In November, Sotheby’s accepted live bids in the ether cryptocurrency – favoured by the digital art and NFT community – for the first time in the sale of two works by Banksy, Trolley Hunters and Love Is in the Air. They sold for $6.7m and $8m respectively. Cryptocurrency payments had become “a viable alternative to fiat currency”, said Arnold. In November, a cryptocurrency group amassed more than £47m, or 11,600 ether, in a few days on its online crowdfunding page in an attempt to buy a rare surviving copy of the US constitution. They were outbid by a hedge fund boss and art collector, Kenneth Griffin. Buyers from Asia accounted for 40% of sales in the contemporary art market in the year to June 2021, beating the US (32%) and the UK (16%). The Asian market has “effectively become the world’s primary zone for the exchange of contemporary artworks”, said the Contemporary Art Market Report. According to Sotheby’s and Christie’s, Asian buyers account for a third of major international sales. Last year Sotheby’s broke records for sales in Asia, reaching $1.1bn by the end of November. Another factor supporting this moment in the market was investors looking at “tangible works of art as stores of value” in a time of rising inflation, said Arnold. She added: “I don’t think this is a bubble, not at all. The conditions in the world at the moment are such that art continues to be a way of storing value. And there is constant wealth creation and new buyers entering the market.” There had been a 50% increase in millennials buying and bidding in Christie’s London sales in October, she said. “If the baby boomers were the ones buying aggressively in years past, we’re starting to see a generational shift, and that means that growth doesn’t only come from new markets like Asia, it also comes within the established markets as the younger generation steps in.”";https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/02/crypto-tycoons-global-art-market-record-levels-2021
5951;5951;For Labour and the Conservatives, racism is really all about reputation management | Nesrine Malik;2022-01-02T14:55:56Z;['Nesrine Malik'];['Race', 'Conservatives', 'Labour', 'Politics', 'UK news'];"It’s rare that the quiet part is said out loud in British politics: the thing that arrives in a chilling soundbite a politician has let slip, or in correspondence leaked many years after those who wrote it leave power. If you have ever, for example, scoffed at the idea that the rightwing press has a hold on British politics, particularly over the Labour party, then an incident that took place 20 years ago may still your rolling eyes. Last week we learned that after Stephen Lawrence’s murder Tony Blair’s Downing Street initially opposed an inquiry into police relations with minority ethnic communities. The arguments for the government’s objection formed a checklist of the hesitations, prevarications and cynical cautions that still stalk efforts to confront institutional racism today. In his initial note recommending an inquiry, Jack Straw, then the home secretary, wrote: “There is clear disquiet, not least within the black community, about the issues raised by this case. I believe that the best way to address these, and draw something positive from this tragic case, would be to launch a broader inquiry into police relationships with ethnic minority communities generally.” Then he hedged, preempting what an uncomfortable proposition that was for Downing Street. “I am concerned,” he said, “that this should not be perceived as undermining the police but as an opportunity to identify and promote good practice.” But even that was not enough to reassure jittery colleagues. In the margins, an official whose identity was unknown addressed Blair’s policy adviser, Liz Lloyd, asking, “Is this sensible?” “No,” replied Lloyd. Others weighed in, saying “an inquiry would raise expectations” that would be hard to achieve, and “even with good presentation” the inquiry would “look like an attack on the police”. You will notice that all these concerns were about the optics rather than the substance of the issue, and the priority was protecting the police and not the Lawrence family or the ethnic minorities whose concerns they represented. Still, perhaps there is nothing that surprising about a government trying to tread carefully when it comes to something as profoundly unsettling as an investigation into police bias towards ethnic minorities. Perhaps there is nothing surprising in government officials defaulting to cost-benefit analyses; you hardly expect the ranks of advisers to be staffed with racial justice warriors instead of steely reputation managers. And Sir William Macpherson’s inquiry did eventually go ahead, such was the undeniable stench of it all and the pressure the Lawrence family wielded. But there is a kicker to the story, and in it we see how the cynicism of self-preservation prevailed at the expense of doing something long-term and substantive about race relations. Shortly before Macpherson published his report, Straw proposed a follow-up – an ambitious strategy that would prioritise race equality considerations in policymaking across government bodies. Yet taking on racial justice in such a direct manner was just too risky, too destabilising to the government. “A regulation nightmare,” said Blair. Angus Lapsley, an official in Blair’s private office, decided not to back a proposal that racist police officers should be dismissed (government was “cool” towards this suggestion, he said), not because the policy would be wrong, but because of how rightwing papers would react to it. Here is where the decibel level rises. “This could easily become a ‘Telegraph cause celebre’ if taken too far,” said Lapsley. Blair agreed, saying: “We do not want to go OTT on this.” The proposal was killed. There is a sort of sickening relief in seeing those sentiments – expressed behind closed doors – spelled out so matter of factly; in knowing for certain that concerns about racial injustice aren’t taken seriously not because they’re not believed but because they rock the boat. Indeed, the smothering of a broad, progressive race policy 20 years ago tells us much about where we are today, with a government proudly hostile to interrogating the true state of race relations. On ethnic minority matters, there is far more continuity between the Labour party and the Conservatives than there are material differences. Both parties share a notion that matters of race are merely a government liability and not something for which the government should take direct responsibility. Last year, that notion was manifest in the shape of the widely discredited report by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities chaired by Tony Sewell. The denial and dishonesty in that document about the extent of the country’s institutional racism was just one step away from Blair’s timidity in front of the rightwing gallery. He passively did not want to upset the Telegraph and its reactionary contingent; today’s Tories actively want to please it. But what Labour and Tory leaderships have both exhibited is deference to a status quo that preserves racial hierarchies and refuses by default to acknowledge any criticism that might challenge Britain’s moral sense of self.
Such is the slippery slope of “moderation”. An unquestioned assumption has developed that the left can prosper in this country only if it sheds “radical” notions of social justice and redistribution that are unrealistic and extreme – that are, in Blair’s words, “OTT”. The best we can hope for is that the good guys go about pursuing change incrementally and surreptitiously. This is an abdication of responsibility, but ultimately it’s worse than that. Lost opportunities to achieve racial equality don’t just throw ethnic minorities under the bus: they are also missed chances to shape the values of the country. Labour’s realpolitik on race may have saved a few fights and stabilised careers in the short term, but in the medium term it also has tilted the ground in favour of the right. And it has sent all of us, marginalised minorities and resentful majorities, hurtling down that slope towards an ever more fractious future.

5952;5952;Oxfam says its work in India is imperilled by ban on foreign funding;2022-01-02T14:20:07Z;['Amrit Dhillon'];['India', 'Oxfam', 'Charities', 'Global development', 'Mother Teresa', 'Narendra Modi', 'South and central Asia', 'Amnesty International'];"Oxfam India has said its work in the country will be imperilled by the government’s refusal to renew a licence that permits it to receive funds from abroad. Oxfam is on a list of thousands of NGOs, according to local media reports, whose licence has not been renewed. Without the licence, these organisations can only use donations and contributions from within India. “Oxfam India will reach out to the Ministry of Home Affairs and urge them to lift the funding restrictions to ensure vulnerable communities keep receiving the support they need at this critical time of the pandemic,” said the Oxfam India chief executive, Amitabh Behar, in a statement. A few days ago, it emerged that Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity, which works among people with leprosy, the dying, abandoned sick children, people with Aids and the destitute, has also been barred from receiving foreign funds. The home ministry said it had detected some “adverse inputs” in the audit of its accounts. The drying up of funds is expected to have a major impact on the work of both organisations, along with many others whose licences have also not been renewed. Some donations will continue to come in from Indian philanthropists and charitable organisations but it will not cover the gigantic shortfall. The ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) has been waging a campaign against NGOs and social activists, particularly those working among the rural poor, forest dwellers, the low castes, and the marginalised and on issues of inequality. BJP leaders including the prime minister, Narendra Modi, have derided social activists as “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxalites” (a reference to revolutionaries fighting in the jungles of India to overthrow the state). They have also accused some NGOs of having links with extremist groups. Analysts say the government sees NGOs, which by the very nature of their work speak out on its policies and human rights record, as a source of undesirable criticism.
“It’s inevitable that given how Oxfam and the others work among the poorest of the poor, the most deprived communities, that their reports on India will not show the government in a good light. This government has always struggled to accept criticism and this taking away of foreign funds can be seen as a way of arm-twisting NGOs into acquiescence,” said the political analyst Parsa Venkateshwar Rao Jr. The most prominent example was the government’s targeting of the human rights organisation Amnesty International, which prompted Amnesty to close its offices and stop its operations last year. It took the decision after its offices were raided and its bank accounts frozen. Amnesty accused the government of a “witch hunt” and of seeking revenge for its reports criticising human rights violations. Since 2014, the government has been making it harder for NGOs to function. It has altered the rules of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act under which they receive foreign contributions to make it harder for them to receive donations from abroad. In 2018, the licences of nearly 20,000 NGOs were cancelled. Nonetheless, the failure to renew the licences of such internationally known names as Oxfam and the Missionaries of Charity has come as a shock.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/oxfam-says-its-work-in-india-is-imperilled-by-ban-on-foreign-funding
5953;5953;ITV journalist Gary Burgess dies of cancer aged 46;2022-01-02T14:19:25Z;['Rajeev Syal'];['Media', 'ITV News', 'News agencies', 'UK news', 'Newspapers & magazines', 'Television & radio'];A 46-year-old television journalist who spoke out about his cancer diagnosis has died, ITV has confirmed. Gary Burgess died peacefully in his sleep at a hospice in Jersey on New Year’s Day. Doctors had found tumours on his lungs and told him they were inoperable. He was first diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1999, and treated for further tumours in 2015 and 2016. Burgess used a popular blog to record his condition. In November 2020, he told followers that he had six to 12 months left to live and documented his cancer journey after receiving the terminal diagnosis. The Manchester-born broadcaster set the world record for the longest radio show at Blackpool’s Radio Wave, staying on air for 76 hours and raising money for charity. In a final message, written for ITV to release after his death, the journalist wrote: “I’ve had the best life. I’ve had the luckiest life. “I met my soulmate and the love of my life who went on to become my husband. I got to work with some of the most amazing people in newsrooms and studios doing the job I absolutely adore. “I’ve been able to share my own relatively short time on this planet surrounded by friends and loved ones who have enriched my life in ways they may never truly understand. “My greatest sadness is the prospect of leaving all of that and all of them behind. The thought of doing that to [my husband] Alan is unfathomable to process, but I also know the very people who’ve shown me love and support will now wrap up those feelings around him in the coming days. “It’s time for me to hand over my microphone and keyboard for others to do the talking about me, so let my final words simply be ‘thank you’. “Every person in my life has, in their own way, helped me live my best life. That’ll do.” Burgess began his career at Radio Wave in Blackpool in 1992, leaving nine years later. He began working as a reporter at ITV Channel TV in May 2011 in the Guernsey newsroom, before moving to Jersey in March 2012. Burgess, who married his husband, Alan, in 2018, was the first to convert his civil partnership to a marriage.

5954;5954;The Italian hamlet that gives a glimpse of life before the web ;2022-01-02T14:12:01Z;['Angela Giuffrida'];['Italy', 'Technology', 'Europe', 'World news'];"At the cafe that doubles-up as a newsagent in Galliano di Mugello, a medieval hamlet in Tuscany, there are no pings from mobile phones, people aimlessly browsing the internet or uploading pictures of their cappuccino to Instagram. Instead, customers read the newspaper – their main source of information on the outside world – or talk to each other. Surrounded by Tuscany’s postcard perfect cypress trees and rolling hills, Galliano di Mugello, would be a haven for those wanting a digital detox. But the absence of mobile phone coverage is a much less endearing quirk for the 1,300 or so inhabitants, who are starting to rise up against not being able to make a call, send a text or search for something on Google on their handsets. “Look at this,” said Daniela Suggelli as she pointed to the signal strength icon on her screen. “There are no bars. It is an absolute nuisance.”
Galliano di Mugello became a symbol of Italy’s digital divide after a report from the ministry of innovation and AGCOM, the communications watchdog, placed it high among the 204 areas in Italy classified in the report as a “very white zone” because of its nonexistent mobile phone coverage and patchy internet service. Although people can access the internet at home via ADSL or through the more recent arrival of fibre broadband, connection is often disrupted, especially when the weather is bad. Almost everyone has a mobile phone too, but they cannot use it when they are out and about in the hamlet. It even captured the attention of Netflix, which earlier this year used the hamlet in a trailer for the Italy promotion of The Mitchells vs the Machines, an animated comedy film about a wacky family fending off a robot apocalypse as technology takes over the world. “In Galliano di Mugello, robots will never rebel,” was the slogan for the Mitchells vs the Machines trailer, which stars some of its residents and goes on to describe the hamlet as a place unburdened by “noise, traffic, long queues … or technological problems”.
While the promotion of the scenery and charms of Galliano di Mugello, which falls under the municipality of Barberino di Mugello, was embraced, the publicity generated by the trailer also presented the ideal opportunity for the mayor, Giampiero Mongatti, to revive his battle to get the hamlet online. Bridging the digital divide is a top priority for prime minister Mario Draghi’s government, with a significant proportion of the more than €200bn (£170bn) that Italy is receiving from the EU’s post-coronavirus pandemic recovery fund set to be spent on digitalisation. “Mobile phone companies don’t invest in Galliano because they don’t think it’s worth the cost,” said Mongatti. “But with the EU recovery fund money, the government should now pay them to invest. It is true that there is a strong sense of community in Galliano and you never see people in the street staring at their phones. All of this is very nice, but at the same time citizens want to be connected and shouldn’t be treated as second-class.” Mongatti, whose office is based with the rest of the town hall in the better-connected Barberino, argued that mobile phone coverage was now a basic necessity, especially in an emergency situation. In December 2019, when the area was struck by a strong earthquake, he was unable to communicate safety procedures to people in Galliano. “We sent out a series of messages on social media, but the thing was that everyone was out on the streets and so couldn’t read the messages,” he said. “I had to send police patrols to tell people what to do.” Marika Batisti, who runs an agritourism farm, was left in a frightening situation in January after a couple of burglars entered the premises during the night. She was unable to go downstairs to use the landline to call the police, as that’s where the burglars were. So she ventured out on to the terrace, and after waving her mobile phone around for some time, managed to get enough signal to make the call. “It was a nightmare, not even the internet was working,” she said. “It’s essential now for security – how are we supposed to call the police or an ambulance if something happens?” The bad internet connection also proved to be an issue when students had to follow online lessons at home during coronavirus lockdowns, with some being forced to take their handsets to the car park of a restaurant perched on a nearby hill, from where a signal can sometimes be found.
“We need the internet for everything nowadays, even to book our Covid-19 vaccines,” said Suggelli. “Although I’m a pensioner, and so the problems don’t affect me so much … but what about people who need it for work or study?” Suggelli tried to put the Guardian in touch with a young female inhabitant to interview, and popped into the butchers, owned by Andrea Guasti, to ask to borrow his landline. “I can’t get through,” said Suggelli. “She probably has no reception – you see the issues it causes?” Guasti, one of the stars of the Netflix trailer, is used to people asking to borrow his phone. “I have a landline here and at home, as well as a mobile phone, which makes everything very costly,” he said. Mongatti said the thing that makes Galliano stand out from other towns or villages with no or precarious internet access is its sizeable population. Neither is it remote – Galliano lies close to the Apennine mountains and is just an hour away from Florence. The area is popular with hikers and even featured in a video for the Madonna song, Turn Up the Radio. But Mongatti refuses to promote it as a holiday destination for those seeking to detox. “When I went to the beach for 15 days in the summer, I turned off my phone,” he said. “But the true liberty isn’t about not having a signal, but about being able to choose when to switch off. And we need to give the citizens of Galliano that choice.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/the-italian-hamlet-that-gives-a-glimpse-of-life-before-the-web
5955;5955;The UK government should join us to create a fair and resilient economy | Frances O'Grady;2022-01-02T14:11:49Z;"[""Frances O'Grady""]";['Economics', 'Economic growth (GDP)', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Coronavirus', 'Trade unions', 'Climate crisis', 'Environment', 'Politics'];"Once again we start a new year with the country in the grip of Covid-19. But as 2022 dawns, the UK should have been better prepared for the disruption of a new variant. In March 2020, the TUC and unions pressed the chancellor to adopt our detailed proposals for a furlough scheme – an emergency response to the first wave of the pandemic. It was a huge success – protecting millions of jobs, keeping businesses open, making the reopening smoother and quicker and making sure families all over the UK could pay their bills. Now, as we face Omicron, we’re having the same old argument about whether government should step in and protect working people’s livelihoods in a crisis. It’s been clear for months that the UK needs a permanent short-time working scheme, learning from the success of furlough, to protect jobs during periods of economic turbulence. Such schemes are common across Europe and help keep businesses afloat when there is a sudden temporary collapse in demand. But ministers have chosen not to listen. After cutting off furlough prematurely in the autumn, the government watched as Omicron hammered our arts, hospitality and aviation sectors in the run-up to Christmas. While the chancellor’s 11th-hour rescue package for pubs, restaurants and theatres will help some, serious damage has already been done to pay packets and to livelihoods. We need to end this stop-start approach to managing our economy.
Businesses and working families shouldn’t be put through an emotional rollercoaster every time the pandemic flares up. They need financial certainty and stability so that when better times return our economy can bounce back fast. Having a permanent short-time working scheme in place, conditional on upskilling and retraining, will ensure that if new restrictions have to be imposed again there is support ready to go. But we can’t stop there. We need to build an economy that can help working families face the future with confidence. There are huge challenges on the horizon. Alongside Covid, climate change is already causing global chaos and threatening jobs in energy-intensive industries such as steel and manufacturing. The longer we put off getting to net zero, the more jobs will be put at risk. And let’s not forget the looming cost-of-living storm. The last 11 years have been the worst period for real wage growth since the Napoleonic wars. And this has come at a huge cost to people’s living standards. Over half of families in poverty today are working families. And many of our key workers – keeping hospitals and public services running – are still earning less in real terms than in 2010. It’s a national disgrace. Without action, the pressure on UK household budgets will only get worse in 2022. This spring, working families face a triple whammy of skyrocketing bills, cuts to universal credit and a hike in national insurance contributions. We urgently need a long-term economic plan for getting wages rising. And the best way to start is by getting more workers covered by collective agreements, sector-by-sector – so they can negotiate a fair pay rise with employers. Giving trade unions greater access to workplaces is the key to boosting pay and employment standards across the country. And it’s not just me saying this. The OECD and governments across the world, from America to New Zealand, have recognised the key role collective bargaining can play in reducing inequality and giving people security at work. Committing to industry-wide fair pay agreements would transform the lives of millions by setting minimum standards – on pay, training, health and safety – and prevent good employers from being undercut by the bad. And fair pay agreements would help ease staffing shortages in under-pressure sectors such as logistics, food production and social care, by making those industries better places to work in. Whether they can boost living standards and working conditions is the acid test of the government’s levelling up agenda.
Alongside campaigning for a pay rise for working people, we are still waiting for the employment bill Boris Johnson promised more than two years ago. Tackling insecure work, outlawing fire and rehire and banning zero-hours contracts – all are long overdue. As too is fixing our broken sick pay system. It beggars belief that we are heading into another wave of the pandemic with millions unable to afford to self-isolate. This year is a crossroads. Beset by pandemics and climate chaos, we can keep reeling from crisis to crisis, unleashing rampant insecurity and inequality anew. Or we can harness the power of active government – in partnership with unions and employers – to create a fairer and more resilient economy. In this age of anxiety, working people are crying out for security. That is my wish for 2022. • Frances O’Grady is general secretary of the Trades Union Congress";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/02/omicron-uk-government-should-join-us-to-create-a-fair-and-resilient-economy
5956;5956;Betty White obituary;2022-01-02T14:07:35Z;['Michael Carlson'];['US television', 'TV comedy', 'Television', 'US news', 'World news', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'Film'];"Although she will be best remembered for playing the naive Rose Nylund in the hit comedy The Golden Girls (1985-92), Betty White, who has died aged 99, was for seven decades one of the best-loved performers on US television, a consummate professional who won eight Emmy awards, the first and last separated by more than 60 years. She was also a pioneer, in the 1950s one of the first women producing television, and, 30 years later, the first female game show host, dubbed a “femcee”. All four lead actors on The Golden Girls won best actress Emmys, but White’s came first, in 1986. This may be because she played against type; Rose was the opposite of her role on the Mary Tyler Moore Show, as Sue Ann Nivens (1973-77), who hid her conniving nature beneath a sugary surface, while performing as the Happy Homemaker at the TV station where Mary worked. From 1983 to 1986 White and Rue McClanahan played together in Mama’s Family, a spinoff from the Carol Burnett Show; when they left to join The Golden Girls, McClanahan, who had been the naive foil to Bea Arthur on Maude, was cast as Rose, with White set to play the man-chasing Blanche. The director Jay Sandrich suggested the two should swap parts, and the chemistry was immediately successful.
Born in Oak Park, Illinois, Betty moved with her parents, Horace White, an engineer, and Tess (nee Cachikis), to Los Angeles during the Depression, and graduated in 1939 from Beverly Hills high school; her colleagues in school theatre included the future film star Rhonda Fleming. She performed on an experimental Los Angeles television channel that year, but made her formal acting debut at the Bliss Hayden Little Theatre. During the second world war she served in the Women’s Voluntary Services, making her movie debut in Time to Kill (1945), a short produced to inform servicemen about military educational programmes; the cast included Jackie Cooper, George Reeves (later TV’s first Superman), DeForest Kelley (later Bones on Star Trek) and Barry Nelson. She also was married, briefly, to Dick Barker, an Air Corps pilot. After parts in radio shows such as Archie and the Great Gildersleeve, she got her own local programme, the first of four Betty White shows in which she would star. In 1947 she married the agent Lane Allen; they divorced in 1949. That year another local radio star, Al Jarvis, was presenting a variety show called Hollywood On Television, and hired White as his “girl Friday”, playing records and doing commercials and interviews. When Jarvis left the show in 1952, White took over as the host. She also joined the writer George Tibbles and producer Don Fedderson in a production company, trying to create shows from the sketches in which she acted on her programme. Life With Elizabeth debuted in 1952, and, syndicated around the country, became an immediate hit, winning White her first Emmy. As a co-producer, White followed Lucille Ball, but it could be argued she had more creative control over her product than Lucy did in Desilu. Life With Elizabeth ran until 1955; during 1954, White simultaneously presented her own variety show, her second Betty White show. She created another sitcom, Date With the Angels, in 1957; when her co-star Bill Williams left in 1958, it too became The Betty White Show before it was cancelled.
White turned to game shows and late-night talk, particularly as a frequent guest on Jack Paar’s show, a forerunner of The Tonight Show, and a regular on Password, with whose host, Allen Ludden, she had acted in summer stock. Ludden also hosted the GE College Bowl, from which University Challenge took its format. White and Ludden were married from 1963 until his death in 1981. In 1962 she made her feature film debut, playing a senator in Advise and Consent, but although she turned in a solid performance, it would be 36 years before White returned to the big screen. In the meantime, her friendship with Password’s creator, Bob Stewart, and its producers, Mark Goodson and Bill Todman, kept her busy on their other shows, such as What’s My Line?, To Tell the Truth, and Password’s many successors. She remained in demand as a guest star, and in 1971 produced and hosted a syndicated show featuring interviews with celebrities and their pets, called The Pet Set. Her career was reborn in 1973 when she debuted as Sue Ann in the Mary Tyler Moore Show’s third season, hired because she and Ludden were friendly with the show’s producer Grant Tinker, who saw that the script called for Sue Ann to be played by “an icky-sweet Betty White type”. She won Emmys as best supporting actress in 1975 and 1976. When the show ended in 1977, she began her fourth Betty White show, a sitcom which co-starred John Hillerman, but lasted only one season. She acted in a number of TV movies before, in 1983 , becoming the first woman to host a game show with Just Men!, in which a panel of men helped women win cars. She picked up a daytime Emmy, her fourth overall.
She had a recurring role on The Love Boat before making her mark again in Mama’s Family, which led to The Golden Girls. With the show’s success White published her first memoir, Betty White In Person (1987). When Bea Arthur left The Golden Girls in 1992, the other three leads continued in The Golden Palace for two seasons. White showed no signs of slowing down, as indicated by the title of her second book, Here I Go Again: My Life In Television (1995). She took a part in the Marie Osmond series Maybe This Time (1995-96) and was busier than ever as a guest, winning her sixth Emmy as best guest-star on The John LaRoquette Show (1996). In 1999 she began two seasons of playing mother to a single father (Alfred Molina) in Ladies Man. She appeared as Catherine Piper in David E Kelley’s series The Practice and its spin off, Boston Legal, and in 2006 made her soap opera debut on The Bold and the Beautiful, as the mother of the show’s matriarch. She proved so popular her role was extended for three seasons, until 2009. She began another TV sitcom, Hot in Cleveland, in 2010, at the age of 88, and it ran for five series. Meanwhile she returned to the big screen in Dennis the Menace Strikes Again (1998). Among the films that followed, her best roles were in Lake Placid (1999) and The Proposal (2009). In 2010, after a Facebook campaign, she became the oldest person to host Saturday Night Live, quipping that at her age she contacted old friends not with Facebook but with a ouija board. She won a Primetime Emmy for this appearance and in 2015 an Emmy lifetime achievement award. Outside the entertainment industry, she was active in animal charities and the Los Angeles Zoo - Betty and Friends: My Life at the Zoo, was published in 2011. She told the Chicago Sun-Times that, as well as for her acting, “I also want to be remembered as a lady who helped the animals”. • Betty Marion White, actor and producer, born 17 January 1922; died 31 December 2021 • This article was amended on 9 January 2022.

5957;5957;To the moon and beyond: what 2022 holds for space travel;2022-01-02T14:00:19Z;['Robin McKie'];['Space', 'Mars', 'The moon', 'Nasa', 'European Space Agency', 'SpaceX', 'Blue Origin', 'Virgin Galactic', 'Science'];"This year promises to be an important one for space exploration, with several major programmes reaching the launch pad over the next 12 months. The US is to return to the moon, undertaking a set of missions intended to establish a lunar colony there in a few years. China is expected to complete its Tiangong space station while Europe and Russia will attempt to land spacecraft on Mars, having failed at every previous attempt. India, South Korea and Japan are also scheduled to put a number of missions into space. Rockets
Particular interest is going to focus on Nasa’s mighty new space launch system (SLS). This is the most powerful rocket it has ever designed and has been built to carry astronauts to the moon and beyond as part of the agency’s Artemis deep space exploration programme. With these missions, Nasa intends to reopen the solar system to investigation by humans – rather than robot probes – and regularly carry astronauts to the lunar surface. The programme’s first launch is scheduled for February when an SLS rocket – standing more than 300ft high – will carry an unmanned Orion capsule on a trajectory that will enter a highly elliptical orbit round the moon. At its closest, the spaceship will sweep within 62 miles of the lunar surface before soaring 40,000 miles above it, a distance that will take it further from Earth than any spacecraft built for humans has ever flown. Crucially, Orion – designed to carry between four and six astronauts when fully operational – will be fitted with a European service module that will provide the capsule’s power and propulsion for manoeuvring in orbit. This will give its manufacturer – the European Space Agency – the opportunity to become a key partner in future Artemis missions. If February’s mission succeeds, a crewed trip around the moon will take place in 2024 and this will be followed by a lunar landing in 2025 – a gap of 53 years since Apollo 17, the last crewed moon mission, touched down on the Taurus-Littrow valley in December 1972. This time the crew will include at least one woman and the mission will mark the beginning of a programme aimed at establishing a lunar colony where astronauts would work on months-long missions and develop technologies that could be used by future colonies on Mars. A prime target for the first lunar outpost is Shackleton crater, near the moon’s south pole, which is believed to hold reservoirs of ice. Water will not only provide precious sustenance for astronauts, it can be exploited as a source of hydrogen and oxygen – by electrolysis – that can be combined as rocket fuel. The moon
As part of its preparations to establish a lunar colony, Nasa will also start a massive programme of robot missions through the agency’s $2.6bn commercial lunar payload services (CLPS) initiative. This will involve sending a flotilla of robot spacecraft to the moon, with the first missions beginning this year. Built by private companies with Nasa backing, these probes will attempt to map underground water deposits, study the moon’s deep interior and release robot rovers to investigate the lunar surface. Fledgling space company Astrobotic will send its newly designed Peregrine lander to Lacus Mortis – “the lake of death” – a plain of basaltic rock in the north-eastern part of the moon. It will carry 11 different payloads of instruments and will be followed by another US company, Intuitive Machines, which is sending a spacecraft carrying six payloads to Oceanus Procellarum, the Ocean of Storms. A further 12 CLPS missions are scheduled for the next three years, though head of Nasa science, Thomas Zurbuchen, has warned that these privately funded efforts each face a high risk of failure. As many as half could go wrong, he said recently. For good measure, Russia and India are both planning to launch their own lunar landers next year, while South Korea is scheduled to place a satellite in moon orbit to study its mineral composition. Mars
The hunt for alien life will take a step further this year with the launch of the joint European-Russian ExoMars mission, which will land a robot rover on the Oxia Planum, a 125-mile-wide clay-bearing plain in the planet’s northern hemisphere. The rover – named after Rosalind Franklin, the British chemist and DNA pioneer – will be fitted with a drill capable of probing several feet below the Martian surface, where it is hoped primitive lifeforms may survive or at least the remnants of extinct organisms. The 660lb rover was built by Airbus Defence and Space, at the company’s UK facility in Stevenage. Launch is scheduled for 22 September and touchdown is expected on 10 June 2023. Hopes of success for the mission are guarded, however, as neither Russia nor Europe has had any luck in landing on Mars. Nineteen Russian and Soviet missions and two European bids to land on the red planet have all failed – including Europe’s Schiaparelli lander, which was intended to be a trial run for the current ExoMars mission but which crashed on the planet in 2016. Asteroids
Easily the most spectacular mission to the asteroids will be Nasa’s bid to test an anti-asteroid defence system for Earth. Launched last year, the double asteroid redirection test (Dart) spacecraft will crash into the moonlet Dimorphos in September. Hurtling into its target at 15,000mph, the 1,340lb probe – the size of a small car – will try to change the orbit of Dimorphos, a lump of rock the size of a football stadium, around its parent asteroid, Didymos. If successful, Nasa and other space agencies will be encouraged to follow up the mission by developing craft that could deflect a larger asteroid heading towards Earth – and so avert an Armageddon-style impact, say astronomers. Should an asteroid the size of Dimorphos crash on Earth, it would trigger an explosion equivalent to 400-600 megatonnes of TNT. “A city like Manhattan would be completely obliterated,” Elena Adams, Dart’s systems engineer, told the journal Science. “This is to demonstrate a technique to save the world.” Nasa has plans for several other asteroid missions next year, including the launch of the probe Psyche. Scheduled for lift-off in August, the spacecraft will visit an asteroid called 16 Psyche that is thought to be the leftover core of a planet. This vast chunk of nickel and iron is the remains of a violent collision with another astronomical object that stripped off the planet’s outer layers and left its metallic innards exposed. Studying 16 Psyche will give scientists an unprecedented opportunity to examine a planetary core. It will also afford them a chance to explore a new type of world – one that is made of metal. Human spaceflight
Boeing will attempt to get its Starliner crew capsule into orbit so that it can begin to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). A 2019 flight failed to reach the station and another attempt last year was called off at the last minute when fuel valves failed to open. Boeing now plans to launch a crewless Starliner in early 2022, followed by a test flight with astronauts later in the year. The capsule will then be used – along with SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spaceship – on a rota to ferry astronauts to the ISS. For its part, China is expected to complete its space station Tiangong – Heavenly Palace – after launching the first of its three main modules, Tianhe, in April. Modules Mengtian and Wentian will be added this year. China has said it hopes to keep its space station – which is considerably smaller than the ISS – inhabited continuously by three astronauts for at least a decade. A key task for crewmen will be to service the Xuntian space telescope, which will be launched in 2024 and which will orbit in formation with the Tiangong station. Fitted with a mirror roughly the same size as the Hubble space telescope, Xuntian’s tasks will include investigations of dark matter and dark energy as well as galaxy formation and evolution. Space tourism
Blue Origin (founded by Jeff Bezos) and Virgin Galactic (set up by Richard Branson) both succeeded in launching maiden sub-orbital flights last year and both say they expect to begin regular missions in 2022, offering groups of tourists a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to Earth.";https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/02/to-the-moon-and-beyond-what-2022-holds-for-space-travel

Patrick Assoumou Eyi – known as “Capello” - faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty of charges that could also include attempted rape on minors and endangering the life of another. Eyi was arrested on 21 December after accusations by alleged victims were reported by the Guardian. Two other coaches - Tout Puissant Akwembé’s Orphee Mickala and Triphel Mabicka from Libreville’s Moussavou FC - are also facing being charged.
“Patrick Constant Assoumou Eyi alias Capello, Orphee Mickala and Triphel Mabicka alias coach Kolo have been referred to the prosecutor’s office, which has opened an inquiry before they are charged by the examining magistrate,” said prosecutor Andre Patrick Roponat. “The investigation continues and other arrests are underway.” Roponat also confirmed that taekwondo coach Martin Avera - known as Master Chacka - has also been arrested on suspicion of paedophilia and is also expected to be charged. “Gabonese sport has been shaken by the revelations made by English newspaper the Guardian,” he added. “Revelations alleging acts of paedophilia committed by coaches in several domains in Gabonese sports. These denunciations profoundly shocked Gabonese people and tarnished the image of our country and has led the justice to open an investigation in all the country and all sports.” Gabon’s president, Ali Bongo, has described the claims as “a very serious matter”.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/gabons-former-under-17-football-coach-facing-sexual-abuse-charges
5959;5959;Kirat Assi: ‘Bobby tried to destroy my hopes, my dreams, every part of my life’;2022-01-02T13:30:18Z;['Julie Bindel'];['Social media', 'Podcasts', 'Internet', 'Identity fraud', 'Digital media', 'Crime', 'Media', 'Women', 'Life and style', 'Relationships', 'Facebook', 'Social networking', 'World news'];"The voice of Kirat Assi, subject of the podcast Sweet Bobby, is so familiar I momentarily forget we had never spoken, let alone met. I am one of the million-plus listeners gripped by her story of being “catfished” – duped into a relationship by someone with a false identity. Assi, who lives in London, fell victim to a complex fraud that lasted eight years and involved up to 60 characters who only existed in the scammer’s warped imagination. At the centre was Bobby, a handsome cardiologist with whom Assi formed a close friendship that turned into romance despite never meeting in real life. Bobby was a real person whose identity had been stolen by the scammer, eventually exposed as Assi’s cousin Simran Bhogal. I ask how the scam, which ended in 2018, has affected her. She says that discovering the truth – that her partner, and all of the other characters created by Bhogal, did not exist – was devastating. “Imagine somebody really close to you had suddenly died, and it’s not one person, it’s all of them. I had lost everybody. Normally, even if you lose a boyfriend, your girlfriends come and look after you.” And then there is the fact that many from within Assi’s own community have chosen to not believe the story, or to ask how she could have “let it happen”. But the breathtaking extent of the con was exposed as a result of Assi’s angry determination. She remains the very opposite of the stereotype of a naive victim – she is razor sharp, witty and has an easy charm. “For me, victim shaming is a big thing in this, it’s what shuts people up,” she says. “Please focus on the perpetrator. Why did she do this?”
The deception began in 2009 when Assi, a 29-year-old radio presenter on a Punjabi station, was contacted on Facebook by Bhogal’s ex-boyfriend, JJ, asking for help on how to win her back. They began to message each other, then when Assi was told JJ had died from an allergic reaction, Bhogal gave her the details for JJ’s brother, Bobby, so she could send condolences. He was someone Assi knew of from the west London Sikh community. As Assi was “getting to know” Bobby, Bhogal ingratiated herself into her life, and became her confidante as the relationship developed, and, later, went horribly wrong. After five years of messages over Messenger, Skype and WhatsApp, Assi fell in love with Bobby, and considered herself in a relationship, “after much pressure and emotional guilt tripping”, she tells me. But there were many obstacles from the outset. Bobby claimed he was in a witness protection programme having been shot in Kenya. He also apparently developed many life-threatening illnesses as a result, which meant he was stuck in hospital in New York. He was manipulative, and, despite her doubts and being told he would only live a matter of months, Assi became emotionally entrapped. “There was always an excuse why he couldn’t come to London,” says Assi. “When we tried to have a video call, he told me his phone was broken and came up with extraordinary excuses for why he couldn’t get a new one. I said, ‘I’m not turning my video on either’. That was me being angry. He would then say, ‘Just turn it on for a minute, just so I can see you,’ because he wanted to make sure I was sitting in my room.” Bobby began to exert more control over Assi, monitoring her movements and dictating her choices. “Bobby would be like, ‘Where are you? Why aren’t you at home? Why aren’t you in your room?’ I didn’t understand why I was sitting at home if he wasn’t here. It was not like me at all.” Assi tells me: “He used to test my reactions to things all the time, it was part of him torturing me. One day he asked, ‘If I joined Isis, would you come with me?’ What was I supposed to say? If I said ‘no’, he is going to pick a fight with me, but he might have a heart attack (remember his life-threatening medical condition). But saying ‘yes’ didn’t feel right either.” When Bobby was supposed to be in London, three years into their relationship, Assi became suspicious of the real reason why he still refused to see her. She discovered real Bobby’s last known address was actually in Brighton, and so confronted him there.
After the horrendous events this confrontation unleashed, Assi turned to Bhogal telling her what had happened, and made the decision to report the deception to the police. “I told them, ‘I’m scared, I want something on record just in case something happens.’ [Bhogal] sat next to me and verified everything to the police.” The next day Bhogal confessed to the scam. “She said, it was me, I was Bobby, I was all of them.” But when Assi reported Bhogal to police they told her: “You’re not the victim, [the real Bobby] is.” Police have told Assi that what happened to her is not a crime, which she refuses to accept. Having won a substantial settlement in her civil case against Bhogal for harassment, misuse of private information and data protection breaches, Assi is continuing to challenge the police decision to not pursue her for coercive control, stalking and harassment. “It was a slow destruction of everything I had. Bobby targeted every part of my life – my career, my dreams, my hopes, my relationship with family, with friends, my studies,” says Assi. “I could have met someone real, had a baby during that time. But the other impact has been on my mental and physical health.” Assi is understandably upset that she is viewed as gullible by some who do not understand the lengths Bhogal went to in order to dupe her. “She could make up whatever she wanted as she was obviously stalking [the real Bobby] and his family and his wife’s family,” says Assi.
There is no law against catfishing but Assi believes there should be. “Such a law would serve as a deterrent,” she says. “It’s shocking how common it is.” What does she think motivated Bhogal’s behaviour? “I think she enjoyed power; she enjoyed me being a challenge,” says Assi, who is slowly rebuilding her life. She is back on her old slot at the radio station, is working in freelance marketing, and hoping to be in a position to move out of the family home and in to her own place soon. I ask Assi how she would feel if she bumped into Bhogal. After all, they live only 20 minutes apart and share an extended family. “I don’t want to see or speak to her again for the sake of my health,” she says. “I just want her to be held accountable for her actions and to take responsibility. And if she needs help with her mental health, she should get that, too.” Sweet Bobby, a six-part podcast, is available now at Tortoise Media";https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/02/kirat-assi-sweet-bobby-podcast-catfish-justice

Cavani’s future is in doubt after Cristiano Ronaldo’s signing in the summer. The Portuguese is first-choice striker and United’s top scorer with 14 goals, his most recent coming in Thursday’s 3-1 win over Burnley. Cavani’s season has also been hampered by injury and having to quarantine for Covid. The 34-year-old has made 10 appearances, with the Uruguayan’s start against Burnley a first in the league since 30 October. Rangnick said: “We had a few conversations in the last couple of weeks – probably the player with whom I have spoken most. I told him from the first day that he is a highly important player. He is probably the only one who can play as a striker back to goal and face to goal. “His professionalism, his work ethic is amazing and I told him that I desperately want him to stay until the end of the season. He also knows how highly I rate him and respect him, and that was also the reason why I played him from the beginning together with Cristiano [against Burnley]. “He knows that I will definitely not let him go. I would rather have another Edi on top of that but for me it’s clear that Edi has to stay. With regard to the other players [leaving in the transfer window], yes, our squad is maybe a bit big with regards to numbers but we still have Covid, we have three competitions.” Rangnick wants Donny van de Beek to remain despite the Dutchman making only two league starts in 2021. “He’s got a top mentality, works hard in every training session,” the interim manager said. “A team player through and through and there will be games where he will get his chance. I also had a longer conversation with him about that and of course it’s difficult for him right now because he also wants to play for the national team. But I still believe that we should keep him, definitely until the end of this season.” United host Wolves on Monday night and Rangnick is confident Ronaldo can start a third game in eight days. “I didn’t see any reason why he shouldn’t be able to play another game,” he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/rangnick-says-edinson-cavani-definitely-staying-at-manchester-united
5961;5961;‘No fear’: England’s Zak Crawley backs himself to score century in fourth Test;2022-01-02T13:21:54Z;['Ali Martin'];['Ashes 2021-22', 'England cricket team', 'Australia cricket team', 'The Ashes', 'Cricket', 'Australia sport', 'Sport'];"A Test average of 10 in 2021, completed with two failures in Melbourne, might have dented the confidence of some players but Zak Crawley certainly talked a good game ahead of his second Ashes appearance.
Crawley emerged as one of the brightest batting prospects in England after what appeared to be a breakthrough 267 against Pakistan in 2020 only for a struggle on the turning pitches of India earlier this year, and then issues outside off stump at home, to turn the 6ft 5in right hander’s flow of runs into a mere trickle. Returning for the Boxing Day Test was always a tall order, not least on a tour without state games and having been bizarrely left out of the England Lions versus Australia A fixture in early December. But though scores of 12 and five followed – the latter during a febrile second evening – Crawley fancies greater rewards lie ahead at the start of 2022. “Obviously I haven’t played my best cricket this last year but I feel in a good place,” he said. “Those stats are misleading sometimes. I have never experienced anything like playing in India, 10 over there felt like a good score at the time. I didn’t feel in great touch in the summer so all of a sudden you’re averaging 10.
“I feel as good as I ever have though and so I don’t look into stats too much. I will certainly look to be a bit more confident and back myself because I know full well I can score a hundred here this week and that’s what I’m looking to do.” Asked about his approach to facing Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc on their home ground in the upcoming fourth Test, Crawley added: “It’s just not fearing them. I feel a few of us on our first Ashes tour, we’re a bit wary of them but there’s no need to be. They’re great bowlers, some of the best in the world, but when you get in as Rooty and Mala [Joe Root and Dawid Malan] have shown, they’ve looked very comfortable at times. I don’t think it will be a tougher test [in Sydney].
“I think the wicket is going to be better, slightly flatter, and it’ll be a bit easier. Having watched the Ashes a fair bit, usually there seems to be a lot more runs here. I am looking forward to that and hopefully that is the case.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/englands-zak-crawley-confident-in-no-fear-approach-before-fourth-ashes-test
5962;5962;Boris Johnson urged by Tory MPs to address ‘cost of living crisis’;2022-01-02T13:16:25Z;['Andrew Sparrow'];['Politics', 'UK news', 'Boris Johnson', 'Conservatives', 'Fuel poverty', 'Energy bills', 'Household bills', 'Consumer affairs', 'Money', 'Poverty'];"Boris Johnson has been urged by Conservative MPs and peers to address what they say will be a “cost of living crisis for many” in 2022. In a letter on Sunday, the 20 parliamentarians said rising energy prices would pose more of a problem for consumers in the UK than in other comparable countries and that the government should cut VAT on fuel bills, and remove environmental levies on energy, to ease the burden on families. The letter was published as a poll of voters in the “red wall” seats that the Tories gained in the 2019 election showed support for Johnson and his party plummeting amid concern that family finances are going to get worse over the coming year. With energy bills rising, tax increases due to take effect in April and inflation on the rise, the cost of living is set to be one of the dominant political issues of 2022. Last week the Resolution Foundation thinktank said costs for average households could rise by £1,200. In their letter to the Sunday Telegraph, organised by Craig Mackinlay, who chairs the Conservative Net Zero Scrutiny group, the MPs and peers say that when the energy price cap is reassessed in April “the likelihood is that domestic tariffs will increase hugely, feeding directly into a cost of living crisis for many and pushing them into what is bluntly called ‘fuel poverty’”.
They say that, although energy prices are rising internationally, UK government policies have exacerbated the problem for consumers. “We have almost uniquely caused our energy prices, through taxation and environmental levies, to increase faster than those of any other competitive country,” they write. The signatories, who include Steve Baker and David Jones, both former Brexit ministers, Esther McVey, the former work and pensions secretary, and Lord Lilley, a cabinet minister in the 1990s, say removing VAT on fuel bills would be a “step in the right direction” and that getting rid of environmental levies on energy would cut fuel bills by 23%. In an article for the Mail on Sunday, the Conservative MP Lee Anderson, who won Ashfield from Labour at the last election, says his voters care about rising energy bills far more than they do about “platitudes spouted about the ‘green agenda’”. Anderson’s article was published alongside the results of a Deltapoll survey of people living in the 57 seats gained by the Conservatives at the last election, suggesting that Labour is now on 49% in these constituencies and the Tories on just 33%. The same poll suggests that, across Britain as a whole, Labour is on 40% and the Conservatives 35%. Deltapoll said if these results were replicated at a general election Johnson would lose more than 100 seats.
The survey asked more detailed questions of voters living in the “red wall” seats gained by Johnson in 2019, suggesting that 40% of them think their household finances are in a worse state since the Tories came to power, against only 12% who say they are better off. Over the coming year 41% expect to be worse off, and 16% better off. By a margin of two to one, voters in these seats do not think Johnson is doing well, the poll suggests, and only a quarter of them think he will still be prime minister this time next year. These voters also think the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, would be a better prime minister (38%) than Johnson (33%), the poll suggests. And, when asked for their preferred team, 40% opt for Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, while just 33% choose Johnson and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/02/boris-johnson-urged-by-tory-mps-to-address-cost-of-living-crisis
5963;5963;One in three Americans say violence against government justified – poll;2022-01-02T13:10:25Z;['Martin Pengelly'];['US politics', 'US news', 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden', 'World news', 'US press and publishing', 'Media'];"One in three Americans believe violence against the government is sometimes justified, according to a new Washington Post poll.
The survey, with the University of Maryland, was released on New Year’s Day – five days short of a year since rioters attacked the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn Donald Trump’s election defeat by Joe Biden. According to the authors of The Steal, a new book on Republican attempts to fulfill Trump’s aim through legal action in key states, the rioters of 6 January 2021 “had no more chance of overthrowing the US government than hippies in 1967 had trying to levitate the Pentagon”. But it was still by far the most serious attack on the seat of federal government since the British burned Washington in 1814 and the Post poll comes amid a sea of warnings of growing domestic strife, even of a second civil war. The Post reported: “The percentage of Americans who say violent action against the government is justified at times stands at 34%, which is considerably higher than in past polls by the Post or other major news organisations dating back more than two decades. “The view is partisan: The new survey finds 40% of Republicans, 41% of independents and 23% of Democrats saying violence is sometimes justified.” Other polls have found that more than half of Republicans believe Trump’s lie that Biden won the White House thanks to electoral fraud, and do not trust elections. As pointed out by Mark Bowden and Matthew Teague, authors of new book The Steal: The Attempt to Overturn the 2020 Election and People Who Stopped It, Trump was ultimately stopped by “the integrity of hundreds of obscure Americans from every walk of life, state and local officials, judges and election workers. Many of them … Republicans, some … Trump supporters”. Nonetheless, at a rally near the White House on 6 January, Trump told such supporters to “fight like hell” in his cause. “And if you don’t fight like hell,” he said, “you’re not going to have a country anymore”. Five people died, including a rioter shot by law enforcement and a police officer. The Post poll found that 60% of Americans said Trump bore a “great deal” or a “good amount” of responsibility for the Capitol attack. However, 72% of Republicans and 83% of Trump voters said he bore “just some” responsibility or “none at all”. The Post reported: “A majority continue to say that violence against the government is never justified – but the 62% who hold that view is a new low point, and a stark difference from the 1990s, when as many as 90% said violence was never justified.” The paper interviewed some respondents. Phil Spampinato, 73, from Dover, Delaware, and a political independent, said he first “contemplated the question of whether violence against the government might be justified” as a way of “defending your way of life” after he saw Republicans changing state laws to restrict voting by Democrats and to make it easier to overturn results.
“Not too many years ago,” Spampinato said, “I would have said that those conditions are not possible, and that no such violence is really ever appropriate.” Anthea Ward, a Republican 32-year-old mother of two from Michigan, said: “The world we live in now is scary.

5964;5964;Chelsea’s Tuchel to drop Romelu Lukaku for Liverpool over interview;2022-01-02T13:01:15Z;['Jacob Steinberg', 'Sachin Nakrani'];['Romelu Lukaku', 'Thomas Tuchel', 'Chelsea', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Thomas Tuchel will punish Romelu Lukaku for his explosive interview by dropping the striker for Chelsea’s home game against Liverpool on Sunday afternoon. Lukaku angered Tuchel by going public with his frustrations with life at Chelsea and saying he would like to return to Internazionale one day. It is understood that the Belgianwill be left out of the matchday squad entirely against Liverpool.
Tuchel has not hidden his displeasure with Lukaku’s comments, which were aired in an unauthorised interview with Sky Italia on Thursday night, and it is understood he remains “livid” with Chelsea’s record signing. The German has held talks with Lukaku, who left Inter for £97.5m last summer, but he could yet decide to take disciplinary action. Chelsea were caught unawares when Lukaku’s remarks about his difficulties adapting to Tuchel’s system were published. The interview is understood to have taken place three weeks ago and was intended to help Lukaku build bridges with Inter fans, but it ended up causing unrest at Stamford Bridge. The club are likely to back Tuchel if he punishes Lukaku, though the manager could settle on fining the forward rather than in effect giving him a one-game ban. It is a huge gamble for Tuchel to drop Lukaku. Chelsea are 11 points behind Manchester City and need to beat Liverpool to stay in the title race. Kai Havertz is a contender to start up front in place of Lukaku. In a press conference for Sunday’s game Tuchel said that were it not for injuries and Covid‑19, Chelsea would be much closer to Manchester City in the Premier League title race and said they “will not stop trying” to hunt down Pep Guardiola’s side between now and the end of the season.
Chelsea have won one of their past four league games, with the latest setback being Wednesday’s 1-1 draw with Brighton, when Danny Welbeck rescued a point for the visitors at Stamford Bridge with an injury-time header. On the same evening, City made it 10 league victories in a row with a 1-0 triumph at Brentford, extending that run with a 2-1 win against Arsenal on New Year’s Day. Tuchel says competing with rivals who have turned themselves into a “winning machine” in recent years is proving difficult. Nonetheless, he is adamant Chelsea have what it takes and are only being hampered by a lack of personnel. Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva, N’Golo Kanté, Jorginho and Ruben Loftus‑Cheek have been out with injury in recent weeks while Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and Mateo Kovacic have been unavailable for selection having tested positive for Covid. There were more setbacks against Brighton when Reece James sustained a suspected torn hamstring that rules him out of Sunday’s encounter with Liverpool, while Andreas Christensen suffered a back strain that makes him a doubt for the same game. “When you look at 2021 [overall], we are 20 points behind and you have to be careful that you’re not over-ambitious and don’t get frustrated by not catching them,” said Tuchel of City. “They know what it takes to produce high-point seasons over and over again. It’s quality all over the club. It’s a machine, a winning machine.
“Maybe it’s a longer race than one season to catch Man City because they will not stop improving. But the huge difference at this moment is with injuries and Covid. I am absolutely convinced that if we are in the same place without having key players out for weeks we [would have] more points and be in the back of them [City]. “That’s why there’s no need to get negative, no need to lose faith. The opposite – we will stay hungry. We will not stop trying.” Tuchel said this period of his tenure as Chelsea manager – the first anniversary of which is this month – has been challenging but, overall, he remains in good spirits, seen most clearly when he was asked who he thinks most people in Germany will want to win when he and Jurgen Klopp go head-to-head. “If you have a full stadium and put Jürgen in it, he could arrive without a team and it would still be full with people laughing for two hours,” Tuchel said with a smile. “That’s his gift, that’s what makes him special. I cannot do it. I will never try.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-will-not-stop-trying-to-hunt-down-manchester-city
5965;5965;We often fail to keep resolutions – but writing in a notebook brings great rewards;2022-01-02T13:00:18Z;['Cathy Rentzenbrink'];['Life and style', 'Psychology', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Science', 'Health & wellbeing'];"In 1989, when I was 16, I moved into a pub with my parents and my younger brother, Matty. It was highly exciting. I took to barwork as I liked the chat, and also enjoyed the opportunities offered for eavesdropping. I was curious about the adult world and up until then had learned most of what I knew from books. Now I had all these real lives to study. I should write some of this down, I thought, and would scribble into my diary before bed. We couldn’t believe how busy it was that first Christmas, culminating on New Year’s Eve, when everyone piled out into the main street at midnight and exchanged drunken embraces and warm wishes for 1990. After the pub had emptied and the mammoth job of clearing up was done, we gathered with our staff for a few drinks and the chat turned to resolutions. All the women wanted to lose weight. A couple of people wanted to stop smoking. I announced very firmly that I wanted to write a novel. I wish I could tell you what Matty said, but I can’t remember. Perhaps he pledged to strive for good GCSE results. If he did, he succeeded, as he got the best grades in school. But by the time the results came, that summer, he had been knocked over by a car and was in a coma after emergency brain surgery. I was by his bedside in intensive care, chattering away to him because everyone from the ambulance drivers onwards had suggested this might help keep him with us and then bring him around. I even tried to pray in the hospital chapel: “Please God, please. Please don’t let him die. He’s too young. He’s too good. I love him too much. Please help him.” When I wasn’t with Matty, I was at home. I could put on a brave face behind the bar, but when I was alone I gave in to my desolation. I couldn’t believe the enormity of what had happened. I had no words. I knew that unless Matty woke up I could never write anything again. The very sight of my diary made me feel sick. I flicked through the pages, hating my younger, innocent self. I bundled them all up and threw them into the skip at the back of the pub, poking them down beneath the flattened boxes and bin liners full of crisp packets and cigarette ends.
Matty didn’t die, but nor did he regain consciousness. He lived on for eight years in a persistent vegetative state until my parents and I went to the family court and were granted permission to withdraw nutrition and hydration so that he could die and we could, finally, eight years after we suffered the loss of him, have a funeral. I was bereft. Over the next decade my words drifted back and I tried to make sense of what happened to Matty and how it felt to be the witness at his bedside. But it was always too hard. Surely if I was talented enough to be a writer, then it would be easier and I’d have fewer doubts. Anyway, what was the point? No one would ever want to read such a gloomy story. I tried to write novels instead, but sooner or later Matty would arrive on the page wanting to be heard. I was stuck. Every so often I’d have another go and then give up. I felt like I was destined to fail at this, as I did at everything else, that the car that knocked Matty over had taken me out, too, that I was alive, but only just, and that I couldn’t ask for too much. I’d put my notebooks away in a drawer and try to care about other things. And then, after the birth of my son, I was filled with a renewed determination. I didn’t want to keep finding myself back at the drawer and realised that the only way I could free myself from this cycle of trying and failing, was to get it all down. I made a new resolution. I just had to do it. It didn’t have to be any good, or even in the right order. And I wouldn’t show it to anyone, so I didn’t have to worry about what other people would think. I read a novel where a priest said that it is our secrets that make us sick. That’s it, I thought. I need to cleanse myself, confess everything on to the page. Only then will I feel better. It was hard. Often I felt like I was wrestling an octopus as I struggled to tame all the different tentacles of the story. I would feel tired and dispirited, but this time I could carry on, and word by word I excavated myself on to the pages, which eventually became The Last Act of Love. It was a long haul. I was 17 when Matty was knocked over, 25 when he died, and 42 when I managed to finish my book about him. And I did and do feel better. There is an astonishing sense of achievement up for grabs if we can be brave enough to make a commitment and then have the stamina to hold steady through all the ups and downs. I am still in awe at the process of writing. The first steps are so simple. We find some paper or turn on a computer. Then we put down some words and fiddle about with them and something magical starts to happen. Writing is the nearest I get to touching the divine and I do feel a little evangelical about encouraging others, so please allow me to suggest it to you as a New Year’s resolution. Much better for us in the long run than any goals around eating less or being less. Don’t resolve to shrink your body! Consider instead the benefits on offer if you are bold enough to mine the self, to disinter your secrets, to finally try to tell that story you’ve been carrying around, perhaps for as long as I did. Or, if that feels a bit much, just write down your life; make a personal record of these interesting times we are living in. What you see on your way to work, perhaps, or what you dreamed, or how you feel just before going to sleep. Three things to be grateful for, four blue things you saw that day, how you nourished yourself or notes from your exercise. Would it not be satisfying this time next year if you had written down a few lines about each day?
Or grumble. I love to have a good old moan into my notebooks. There is a release to be had in having a private space to let off steam. In this world of hyper communication where anyone with a social media account can feel under pressure to issue press release style comment on every issue and event, there is a glorious privacy to be found in taking up a pen and scribbling down our own thoughts with no aim other than making sense of things for ourselves. The best piece of advice I have for you is that you need to accept that you will have to put in some effort. Unhelpfully, our culture over-focuses on talent. We think writers are special and imagine that those anointed ones simply sit at their magnificent desks in a book-lined room and allow beautiful prose to flow from their pens, all in the right order. From my own practice, and observing other writers, we get along much better when we escape that idealised image and concentrate instead on effort. Most worthwhile activities do involve preparation and graft. We accept that if we want to run a marathon or climb a mountain, we’ll need to work hard. My writing life has become less anguished since I have stopped being cross with myself that I don’t find it easy. Another cultural misunderstanding I’d like us to jettison is that writing should lead to publication and profit. We can do it purely for pleasure and our personal development, in the way that we might go on a watercolour course, or learn to play the ukulele, or get into running or swimming. Not every pursuit in life needs to have a commercial purpose. Writing offers us stimulation, meaning and purpose and a way to keep our eyes on the stars. Let that be enough in the early stages. Don’t put any pressure on those tender shoots. Though, who knows what might happen? Writing is very much an acorn activity. The important thing is to start and then we may be amazed at what we end up cultivating. And my resolution this year? Well, I do fancy dabbling in watercolour and ukulele and I also want to finish a book, of course. Recently, when I visited the pub, one of my old friends there said: “You were always going on about writing. And now you’ve done loads.” I hope that more than three decades after I made my first resolution, 2022 will see me finish my sixth book. I know there will be ups and downs, but I’ve learned that it is so worth sticking with it.

5966;5966;Phenotypes by Paulo Scott review – artfully plotted tale of race, privilege and guilt;2022-01-02T13:00:18Z;['Lucy Popescu'];['Fiction', 'Books', 'Culture'];"According to Brazil’s 2010 census, 43% of citizens identify as mixed-race, while 30% of those who consider themselves white have black ancestors. Brazil has always wrestled with issues surrounding colourism and racial classification. Even affirmative action policies – such as race-based quotas at universities – have proved contentious. Paulo Scott explores these tensions in his latest novel, seamlessly translated by Daniel Hahn. Lourenço and Federico are from the same Porto Alegre family – their father is black, their mother white. Lourenço is dark-skinned, while Federico’s pale skin means he passes for white. Uncomfortable with the privilege this brings him, Federico works with disadvantaged black youth and dedicates his life to fighting racism. But guilt taints his close relationships and fuels his quick temper. Eventually he moves away, while his brother, a basketball coach, remains a popular figure in their neighbourhood. Phenotypes opens in 2016, at the height of the quotas controversy. Some students have used their black ancestry to abuse the scheme, while other eligible students are deemed “insufficiently brown”. Federico has been asked to sit on a government commission in Brasília charged with limiting race fraud. Meanwhile, anti-government protests are spreading across the country and a family emergency calls him back to Porto Alegre.
This is an artfully plotted tale about race, privilege and guilt. Scott circles around the inflammatory event that occurred decades before – a racist comment that provoked a violent fight among teenagers – and demonstrates how quickly prejudice spreads, often with lifelong repercussions. Years later, this incident is linked to the detention of Federico’s niece for the illegal possession of a firearm. Scott’s characterisation is superb. Federico’s complexities are revealed through his interactions with others, their different views of him, his public image and inner angst. His conflicted protagonist is flawed but hugely sympathetic. The stream-of-consciousness narrative, long sentences, paragraphs that run over pages and lack of speech tags are challenging, but careful reading proves richly rewarding. Phenotypes educates and entertains in equal measure. Phenotypes by Paulo Scott (translated by Daniel Hahn) is published by And Other Stories (£10).

5967;5967;From torment to pleasure: how playing the violin became part of me;2022-01-02T12:00:17Z;['Fiona Maddocks'];['Music', 'Classical music', 'Culture', 'Education', 'Schools', 'Children', 'Society', 'Hobbies', 'Life and style'];"I had an uncle who, intermittently and not necessarily simultaneously, wore a kilt and played the violin. Each to me was exotic – twin roads to freedom from the dullness of a prosaic, southern English childhood. For a short time I took up highland dancing, with real swords and modest skill. I was seven when I begged to be allowed to join the new string class at school. Above all, I wanted the “equipment”: an eighth-sized violin and silk scarf to wrap it in, bow, spare strings, heavy wooden case with green felt lining (just as I’d wanted the kilt, jacket, sporran, jabot and special laced shoes for dancing). The other children soon dropped out, bored by playing long, slow notes on open strings. It was deadly indeed and sounded awful. There’s no quick path to becoming even a modestly accomplished violinist. Left on my own, things progressed. The nice teacher complimented me on my “good ear” as I sawed through Will Ye No Come Back Again. I won a place at the junior department of a London conservatoire, going by myself, aged 11 until I left school, every Saturday morning: negotiating public transport, having breakfast in cafes and spending the afternoon wandering up and down Charing Cross Road, wondering at the mysterious rubber “health” objects (health meaning sex) hidden at the back of seedier secondhand bookshops. It was an education. It was, too, a wonder I escaped unscathed. A few creepy flashers aside, I was left alone.
The only abuse I got, looking back, was from the bullying violin teacher I was assigned. The experience of being confined in a tiny practice room with an emotionally and psychologically threatening adult is, alas, not rare for children learning musical instruments. The necessary intimacy of one-to-one lessons can be a joy or a peril, the risks only very recently brought into the open, and monitored. The same could not happen now. In my case, the problem was not sexual. This teacher, I’ll call her Mme Lorgnette – you must picture her, squeezed into the unlikely attire of gold lamé smoking jacket and matching skirt, and muddied brogues – arrived late every week, puffing and blaspheming, pulled by her charmless dog. While I struggled to play dull technical exercises, madame blew smoke rings from her cigarillos and read her newspaper, occasionally screaming “Shut up!” at the dog (or it may have been at me) as it yowled in open contest. Both dog and owner were acridly malodorous, the windowless room a fug. Every minute was torment.
At the end of each session, I had to take the dog outside (“make sure it does its business”), making me late for my next lesson elsewhere in the large building. But I had a scholarship. I was lucky to be there. My parents were proud. How did one complain, by oneself, at that age? No one ever asked how I was getting on, or inspected a lesson, or wondered why my progress was so pitifully slow and lacklustre. Fortunately, I had no intention of becoming a professional violinist, for reasons of aptitude, application and self-consciousness at performing. I can’t entirely blame that teacher, but the experience closed off options. I learned less than I might have done. Yet those Saturdays were part of my identity and, in a combative way, the passport to wider horizons I so wanted. Though my playing had stalled, I loved the other lessons: the theory and orchestra and music history. Without realising, I was equipping myself for the job I would eventually have: writing about music. After I’d stopped lessons and the drudge of exams, everything changed – too late, yet just in time. I went on exciting music courses and spent every spare moment playing in student ensembles. No one shouted at me. There was, even, laughter. Music came alive, it became life. I began to play in string quartets (that is, usually, two violins, viola and cello) with friends and sometimes strangers. There’s an unrivalled pleasure in playing chamber music: a joint venture in which merely getting through can be harder, and more rewarding, than you’d ever think. New worlds opened. To forge the link between myself and the violin – by now in my first job as a journalist – I commissioned a new instrument, not a common procedure, for amateurs or professionals. I was introduced to a violin-maker, Juliet Barker, who was just establishing an important English violin-making school in Cambridge. I saved my meagre earnings each month to pay for it, and watched as, over two or more years, seasoned white wood turned to varnished gold and became an instrument. No one else has ever played that violin. It’s far superior to any I could otherwise have afforded, old Italian instruments being preeminent. It remains my prized possession.
The brakes went on when children arrived. I was a violinist but one who was resting. The children grew up. I started playing again, as far as a busy schedule would allow, and reunited with the same friends. They’d gone on playing in the intervening years and opened the circle to let me back in. Then, not long ago, I smashed my left arm, the one that creates the notes. Surgery and metal worked miracles but left it stiff. A Schubert string quartet can last 40 minutes. Straightening the arm afterwards takes a bit of teeth gritting. For a professional player, that everyday accident would have ended their career. As so often in life – read Marcel Proust, read Anthony Powell – the music of time has danced its onward dance. New lodgers, models of the species, moved in, one a master luthier, or maker of stringed instruments. The quiet plucking of lute or oud sometimes wafts up through the floorboards (a rare boast in Peckham, south-east London). Could he put a little love back into my violin, neglected in lockdown? He took it off to his workshop, discovered its maker – now a revered pioneer and veteran in her 90s – and admired her craft. He renewed the glue and adjusted parts that had cracked or shifted, restoring the instrument’s tone and vitality. I can’t call playing the violin a hobby. It’s part of me, silent or not. Like everyone, I’ll make various improbable resolutions for the new year. If I can get together with friends in one room to play quartets or trios or duos, I’ll be OK. Just don’t expect me to go it alone. How to do it The rise of online lessons means that an army of tutors awaits the chance to discover your dormant virtuoso. Websites such as Music Teachers or Private Music Lessons are good places to look. Arts Council England-supported music hubs can also help you access lessons or groups in England. Many centres of musical excellence – such as Sage Gateshead and the Royal Academy of Music – offer lessons and community programmes for beginners and enthusiasts. The British Council has a list of national initiatives which might inspire you. If you’re a lapsed musician and want to find other people to play with, look at Making Music or Contemporary Music for All. Both sites let you search for groups in your area from choral societies to samba bands. Someone local will be singing your tune.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/02/from-torment-to-pleasure-how-playing-the-violin-became-part-of-me
5968;5968;Understanding, not judgment, should shape our response to those who remain unjabbed | John Harris;2022-01-02T12:00:16Z;['John Harris'];['Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Science', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Health', 'UK news', 'Politics'];"Amid rocketing Covid infection rates, rising hospitalisation numbers and test shortages, the opening weeks of 2022 are going to be defined by the UK’s vaccine gap. According to the latest official figures, 91% of people aged over 18 in the UK have had at least one Covid jab, 88% have received two and 64% have had their third. But the 9% who have yet to be vaccinated at all accounts for about five million people, whose preponderance among those now being hospitalised is clearly a huge problem. Precise figures are a matter of debate: some senior NHS staff put the share of unvaccinated people on their wards at up to 90%, although the most recent estimates show the share of people needing critical care who are unvaccinated running at just over 60%. What cannot be doubted is that if more people were vaccinated, the latest phase of the Covid crisis would be much more manageable, and the people in charge might not be faced with such a difficult set of options.
If the NHS is soon overwhelmed, tightening across-the-board restrictions might become inevitable, but it would highlight the unfairness of disrupting the lives of the vaccinated majority to protect those who are still unjabbed. Coercing people into getting vaccinated using stringent Covid passports – let alone introducing compulsory inoculation – would infuriate the Tory backbenches, make Boris Johnson’s future all but impossible, and even to many of us outside Conservative circles mark a worrying extension to the state’s reach, not least under a government as illiberal as this one. There are, in fact, no clear and easy choices, beyond retaining a vague hope that the sudden urgency of the pandemic’s latest phase might convince more people to pitch up at a vaccination centre, and keeping faith in the grassroots organisations currently doing their best to change minds. To some people, though, the issues are completely straightforward. Ten days before he was made a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Tony Blair issued a characteristically sweeping verdict: “If you’re not vaccinated and you’re eligible … you’re not just irresponsible, you’re an idiot”. He later expressed regret about his choice of words, but by then it was rather too late: he had already triggered a wave of judgment on social media, suggesting that most unvaccinated people were either reckless fools, or the unhinged disciples of those online cults that put the past two years of human history down to a quest to tighten the grip of the secret world government. Inevitably, the facts of the vaccine gap are immeasurably more complicated, as no end of statistics prove. According to the latest numbers published by the UK Health Security Agency, 30% of eligible people in Liverpool are yet to receive their first jab. In Birmingham, the figure is 33%; in the London boroughs of Newham and Tower Hamlets, about 38% and 34% respectively. Conspiracy theory and misinformation are sizeable and worrying features of the Covid era, and our politicians still say surprisingly little about them. But particularly in cities, beyond high levels of mobility and transience, figures showing large numbers of unvaccinated people reflect much deeper questions of age, class, ethnicity, faith and language – and what poverty, insecurity and institutionalised prejudice do to people’s relationship with the state. In that sense, the limits of the vaccination drive remind us of one of the most simple truths of power and politics: that if governments continually ignore fundamental issues of trust and basic empathy, any big social rupture will instantly reveal the consequences.
Earlier this week, I spoke to Manisha Kumar, an inner-city GP in Manchester and the medical director of the city’s health and care commissioning partnership, which is steering a grassroots vaccination drive that involves an array of local organisations centred on the city council. The main figures she and her colleagues work with are based on people registered with a medical practice. Some come with caveats, but they show the proportion of eligible Mancunian adults who have not received even a single vaccine dose currently standing at about 30%. In more affluent areas of the city, less than 20% of eligible people have not been jabbed, but in some poorer neighbourhoods, the figures tend to hover at about 50%. In aggregate, white people who identify as English, Scottish, Welsh or British register vaccine uptake levels of more than 80%, whereas the current number for people from a Caribbean background is 52%; among those classified as Gypsy or Traveller, the figure is 28%. Such numbers, she said, only tell you so much: what is important is to get to the complex combinations of factors that make people either hesitant about vaccination, or downright hostile. “People come to this with their beliefs, their experiences of Covid, their perception of risk – there isn’t just one sort of person who hasn’t come forward,” she said. In some parts of the country, she went on, “you can just open your doors, send out a text, and people will come.” Her patch, by contrast, requires much more delicate and detailed work. “The majority of the city is hugely deprived, and lives in very small communities defined by culture, identity and geography. Knowledge of those communities is really important.”
What is lacking from a lot of people’s understanding of the vaccine gap, she told me, is any real sense of the sheer weight millions of people have borne over the past two years, and how precarious their lives often are. “The pace of change, the amount of information coming out – for some people it’s just been overwhelming. They’ve gone: ‘I can’t do this – it’s too much. I’ve lost my job, I’ve got issues with domestic abuse, my children are out of school.’” She also talked about huge issues around access to the internet, made worse by vaccines being introduced during lockdown. “People didn’t have phone credit or data roaming, or wifi in their houses. So when you sent out a link saying ‘Book on the national booking service’, they couldn’t do it.” By way of getting to the heart of it all, a PowerPoint presentation she sent me made mention of “historic lack of trust in public institutions including health services within some groups and communities”. In some black communities, she said, people’s relationships with authority are so poor that that some have chosen to be vaccinated well away from where they live and work, “because they’re almost embarrassed to be vaccinated, thinking their community isn’t behind them.” She paused. “There’s no easy fix. We just keep on talking.” In a lot of what she said, there were echoes of the kind of government actions that have only furthered people’s distance from the state, from the creation of a cruel and punitive benefits system, to the hostile environment doctrine that quickly led to the Windrush scandal. Cutting spending on English tuition was always going to keep people confined to the social margins; the innumerable other ways that austerity has hacked back even the most basic everyday help has made things even worse. If you are white, middle class and confident enough to play the kind of games large institutions always demand, the state might look benign and dependably helpful. But if it usually treats you with a mixture of hostility and indifference you will tend to keep your distance, even when it says it has your best interests at heart. In the UK and elsewhere, what all that means for any attempt to make all of us move in lockstep is simple enough. The vaccine gap shows us how far we are from being a society that understands itself collectively, and how easily we still break into “us” and “them”. It demands not judgment, but a level of understanding we have yet to get near.

5969;5969;A wounded PM and ailing economy force England to ‘go Swedish’ on Covid | Larry Elliott;2022-01-02T11:23:00Z;['Larry Elliott'];['Business', 'Economics', 'Coronavirus', 'Economic policy', 'Boris Johnson', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'NHS'];"Government policy towards Covid-19 has come full circle. For now, at least, England has returned to the Swedish way of dealing with the pandemic. Tough, officially imposed lockdowns are out. Trusting the people to do the sensible thing is back in. Whether this approach will survive the expected surge in hospitalisations from Christmas and New Year revelries remains to be seen. Boris Johnson is the master of the screeching U-turn and with the number of infections hitting new records pressure on Downing Street to act is growing. We have been here before. Back in the early days of the pandemic the prime minister was minded to copy Sweden, a country that imposed few restrictions and decided early on that it needed to learn to live with the virus.
The prime minister’s flirtation with the “Swedish experiment” was brief, and at the end of March 2020 a draconian lockdown was imposed. Ministers knew this would have a dire impact on the economy but felt the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed left them no choice. A paper published in the online journal Scientific Reports last year examined what would have happened had Britain followed the Swedish approach. Even assuming the public here would have been as willing to adhere to non-mandatory recommendations as the Swedes (a pretty big assumption) the UK death rate would have at least doubled. This time, the decision is a lot less clearcut, not least because vaccines are providing protection from the virus. The news from South Africa, one of the countries where Omicron first surfaced, has also been encouraging. While more transmissible, the new variant has resulted in fewer hospitalisations and deaths. Case numbers, after rising rapidly, have started to decline. A degree of caution is needed when comparing the two countries, because South Africa has a much younger population than Britain, and it is summer rather than the middle of winter there. Even so, it is clear the government has set a high bar for imposing further restrictions. The prime minister’s weakened political position is one reason the government has gone Swedish. The risk of causing serious damage to the economy when it is looking particularly vulnerable is another, because this is going to be a tough year for the British public. Inflation is rising, interest rates are going up, and energy bills are expected to rocket in the spring just as Rishi Sunak’s increase in national insurance contributions comes into force. The cumulative effect is a whopping cut to living standards. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank the average household is going to be £1,000 a year worse off. Those on the lowest incomes will be especially hard hit by soaring gas and electricity bills. In the circumstances, it is easy to see why the government is reluctant to add to the economic pain by imposing tougher restrictions to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. Fresh curbs mean slower growth and a hit to the public finances. They would also test the resilience of the labour market. The Swedes came in for a lot of criticism for their go-it-alone approach. While death rates were much lower than the initial pessimistic forecasts, they were still higher than in neighbouring Scandinavian countries, where tough restrictions were imposed. Moreover, the initial hit to the economy was as severe in liberal Sweden as it was in locked-down Denmark. That said, as the second anniversary of Covid’s arrival looms, governments are beginning to see merits in the Swedish approach. In part, that’s because Sweden now has a lower death rate than countries that went down the full lockdown route, including the UK, France, Spain and Italy. It is in the bottom half of the EU league table for deaths once the size of population is taken into account. Economic recovery has been pretty brisk. The UK is still struggling to get back to pre-Covid levels of output: Sweden had managed that by the middle of 2021. But there are other factors, too. Sweden has avoided the problem of lockdown fatigue and has not caused damage to the life chances of its children because schools were kept open for under-16s throughout the pandemic.
All of which suggests the Scientific Reports paper will not be the last word on the Swedish experiment. There have been precious few upsides to the pandemic but one of them is that it has thrown up rich country-by-country data for academics from all disciplines – epidemiologists, economists, educationalists, sociologists – to examine and argue about. Even within countries different approaches have been tried. The four constituent nations of the UK have exercised their own powers, so it should soon be possible to assess the impact of closing nightclubs in Scotland and Wales, but not in England, for New Year’s Eve. EU countries have varied in their approach, while the US provides 50 states to study. What is clear is that no one country got everything right and all made mistakes, unsurprisingly enough given they weren’t expecting a global pandemic. It is also obvious, as time passes, that governments – be they in London, Edinburgh, Rome or Paris – are only tightening restrictions with reluctance. In a way, that’s a backhanded compliment to the Swedes for perhaps being on to something right from the start. • This article was amended on 4 January 2022.

5970;5970;Early modern witch-hunts ‘left Britain with collective wound’;2022-01-02T11:19:38Z;['Harriet Sherwood'];['Society', 'Exhibitions', 'UK news', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'Violence against women and girls'];"Women today are experiencing the “inherited trauma” of the persecution and execution of their forebears who were branded as witches, according to the curator of a new exhibition on the period known as “the burning times”. Thousands of women were accused of witchcraft in the UK and Ireland between 1450 and 1750. Many were tortured until they identified relatives and neighbours as witches; those deemed guilty were hanged and, in the case of Scotland, their bodies then burned.
“The burning times affected everyone within a community – men, women and children alike, not just those branded as witches,” said Cali White, the exhibition’s lead curator. “Our whole nation was traumatised and divided by what became a mass hysteria, passed down over generations. The legacy of this has left a collective wound which affects us all in some way, and which we are now being called to understand and heal.” The exhibition seeks to dispel myths of “black pointy hats, devil-worshipping and warty-nosed old women”, instead educating people in the “untold history lesson” of what happened over three centuries. “Witch-hunts affected everybody, not just the witches. It affected whole communities,” said White. It became a way to rid a community of anyone viewed as a problem. “People who questioned the authority of the church or state could easily become a target. Women learned it was safer to stay quiet than to speak up or stand out.”
Women were forced to betray each other under torture. “There was fear of betrayal, fear of persecution, fear of ostracisation. And then when the hanging or the burning took place, the whole town was expected to go and watch. Can you imagine watching somebody you know being put to death in such a brutal way?” Witch-hunts “divided our communities, taught us to play small in order to survive and broke our trust in the people closest to us. The scars we still carry show up in many ways: 25 generations on, we are left feeling powerless, isolated, stuck, divided, unsafe and unsupported,” said White. In 2020, a campaign was launched in Scotland to pardon about 2,500 women who were executed, often after prolonged torture, and for a national memorial to be created. The number of accusations of witchcraft was four times higher in Scotland than elsewhere, according to Claire Mitchell QC, the campaign’s founder. According to White, there are 36 countries in the world where witch-hunts still take place, resulting in thousands of people being tortured and killed every year. Half the profits from the exhibition will be donated to charities working to stop modern-day witch-hunts. But the notion of witches was also being reclaimed as a “positive force”, said White. “There’s a younger generation that has grown up with the likes of Harry Potter, for whom being a witch has become a positive identity.” Witch groups have large followings on social media, and for some it is a “pathway to spirituality”.
The centrepiece of the exhibition is a memorial comprising 4,000 hand-printed and stitched pieces of fabric, each bearing the name of a woman found in records of witch trials in the UK and Ireland. More than 1,000 women across the world were involved in making the memorial, which White described as “beautiful, very feminine and very tactile”. The exhibition, created by the Silver Spoons Collective, also includes interactive installations, painting, film, music and storytelling. “We offer a powerful opportunity for reflection and reconnection, and the chance to be part of a growing movement for social change and healing,” said White. I Am Witch is at the Storey Institute in Lancaster, 5-28 January • This article was amended on 2 January 2022, to reflect a change made to the exhibition dates. It now begins on 5 January, not 4 January as an earlier version said.";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/02/early-modern-witch-hunts-left-britain-with-collective-wound
5971;5971;There’s a new tax rule for US small business owners. What to make of it? | Gene Marks;2022-01-02T11:00:16Z;['Gene Marks'];['US small business', 'PayPal', 'Business', 'Technology'];A new tax rule will impact millions of small businesses in 2022. You can thank one small change buried in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Let’s suppose you’re a small business owner or freelancer, and you get paid from a digital payment service like PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, Cash App or any third-party settlement provider that’s accepting credit cards on your behalf and putting money into your bank account. If those payments were for goods and services that you sold to customers, it was previously up to you to make sure you were reporting that income on your tax return. But now, beginning in 2022, if you receive more than $600 in total during the course of the year – regardless of how many customers are paying – your payment service is required to report that amount to the IRS. Let’s be clear: you should be reporting those amounts as income anyway. But the reality is there are 30 million small businesses, freelancers, solo-preneurs and independent contractors in the US and – if my client base is any indication – many of them who receive a number of small payments from many customers throughout the year may, well, forget. Particularly if – as is often the case – there are many small transactions or their record keeping is sub-par. But no worries! The IRS will now be able to find out what you earned anyway. This means that whether you’re selling products or services on Amazon, Etsy , eBay or at craft shows or just face-to-face, you can now expect to receive a 1099-K form – after 31 January 2023 – from the payment services that you’re using of the revenue they reported on your behalf to the IRS for the purchases of goods and services made in 2022. How do these services know that the purchases were made for goods and services and not just a payment from a friend or family member? Most of them are adding an extra form during the payment process for the payer to identify the nature of the payment. You can also expect more questions this year from your payment service provider. “You may notice that in the coming months we will ask you for your tax information, like a social security number or tax ID, if you haven’t provided it to us already, in order to continue using your account to accept payments for the sale of goods and services transactions and to ensure there aren’t any issues when these changes take effect in 2022,” PayPal warns in a blogpost. This helps us meet our obligations to the IRS and ensures that you will be able to continue using your account and access PayPal and Venmo features and services.” There will be some overlap. For example, if you’re an independent contractor working for a company and you receive more than $600 via a payment service then you’ll likely get both a 1099-MISC from that company and a 1099-K from the payment service. In this situation you’d use the amount on the 1099-MISC and, assuming there are no other amounts from the payment service, you’d disregard the 1099-K. Got it? So what will the government do with this information? Nothing bad, I’m sure. They just want to know more about you and your business, that’s all! According to the IRS the data collected will only be used for “taxpayer education and outreach products and services” as well as “new examination and collection approaches”. Translation: if you’re not reporting the right amount we’re gonna get ya! “For the 2022 tax year, you should consider the amounts shown on your 1099-K when calculating gross receipts for your income tax return,” PayPal warns. “The IRS will be able to cross-reference both our report and yours.” Happy new year, everyone!;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/02/new-tax-rule-paypal-venmo-cash-app
5972;5972;Fashion designer Gabriela Hearst: ‘I could always have gone back to selling cattle’;2022-01-02T11:00:16Z;['Scarlett Conlon'];['Fashion', 'Life and style'];"Hang on, wait there a minute, I want to show you something,” says Gabriela Hearst, hopping up from her chair in her airy Manhattan office and reaching for something on the shelves in the background of her Zoom frame. “These are my journals from when I was 16 or 17 – let me check the date, um 1993, yes I was 17 and look!” She flattens a page full of colourful teenage drawings and holds it up to the camera: “I designed a whole freaking shoe collection!” That these journals remain within reaching distance of the fashion designer’s desk in her Chelsea studio is testament to the fact that despite the success she has achieved, Hearst never forgets where she came from. As creative director of her award-winning brand, founded in 2015, and a year into the same prestigious role at the fashion house Chloé, it would be an understatement to say that Hearst is hot property in the fashion world right now. Not only can she count the likes of Angelina Jolie, Gillian Anderson, Greta Thunberg and Jill Biden as fans of her brand (she dressed the latter in the embroidered white coat for the evening of the 2020 inauguration), but she is making all the right kind of fashion headlines for her determination to demonstrate to an industry famed for its unsustainable practices that sustainable innovation can make good business sense, too. It’s also a serious asset that her husband, John Augustine Hearst – a senior member of the Hearst Corporation and an heir to one of the wealthiest families in America – is involved in the self-financed company. Since day one of her eponymous brand, which is famed for its luxe-craft aesthetic, she has raised the bar for how to run a luxury fashion house sustainably. She has set a goal to use 80% deadstock fabric within three years and no virgin materials by 2022. Her first fashion-week catwalk in 2016 – where she brought chairs from her house and donated the metal floorboards from the show when it was over – laid the foundations for the first-ever carbon-neutral fashion show in September 2019. Earlier that same year her brand declared itself plastic-free, “front and back of house”, using recycled cardboard hangers and bio-based TIPA packaging that is fully compostable. And she has re-romanticised the idea of waiting lists, making her handbags more or less to order to avoid any waste.
It’s a passion which comes from the bucolic childhood that Hearst likes to keep as close to heart as she does to hand. Born into a sixth generation of ranchers in remote Uruguay in November 1976, she spent her childhood living pretty much off the grid, herding cattle from a young age at her parents’ 17,000-acre ranch in Paysandú. “It is extremely remote,” she emphasises. “When I was a kid and it would rain, you wouldn’t get out because the rivers would flood. We would have to plan a whole year of what we would eat because you couldn’t just pop to the supermarket or deli.” In the absence of a TV, the radio provided entertainment, while for the designer, “My toy was my imagination,” she says. “A lot of the creativity I have today is from using my imagination [back then]. Imagination is all problem solving, right? On a ranch you have to use it a lot; you can’t just bring in an expert if something doesn’t work. That time taught me that essentially quality comes from a utilitarian perspective… and even in a humble environment there is high quality, because everything is made to last a lifetime.” This rationale – and the rhythms of following nature in her early developmental years – is what Hearst credits her appreciation of the earth and its resources to. She also has an innate understanding of how to use common sense: “Resetting your mind on what needs to be done in order to function? Ways to prioritise was ingrained in my upbringing!” she says. Such formative years would go on to create a force to be reckoned with later down the line.
In 2017, she won the prestigious womenswear International Woolmark Prize; in May 2018, she won Pratt’s Fashion Visionary Award for her commitment to sustainability; in April 2019, LVMH Luxury Ventures took a minority stake in the business; she was named the Fashion Council of America’s Womenswear Designer of the Year in 2020 (the fashion equivalent to the Oscars); and last month she was named a Leader of Change at the British Fashion Awards. “This recognition humbly gives us more drive for the road ahead,” she told her followers on Instagram (where, by the way, you can find her high-kicking her way into buying meetings, demonstrating how to wear her designs, and sharing inspirational images of her mother herding criollos horses). Hearst’s own road to success, it transpires, has been as dynamic as she is. Turning the page in her journal, she proudly holds up a sketch that reads: ‘I am going to Australia!’ “When you live in Uruguay, you are really far away from everything and [when I was 17] I wanted to go to Australia like nothing else in the world. I told everyone I was going there and they said I was crazy,” she explains. “Then one day a friend told me about a scholarship that would take me there. There was one place, I applied with this whole presentation and I got it.”
After returning to Uruguay, Hearst convinced her mother to let her get a paid job to save money to go and see a friend in New York who she had met during her scholarship. “I arrived [in New York] in 1994 when I was 18 and within hours I said, I am going to live here,” she says matter-of-factly. Six years later, she made the move a permanent one, enrolling at the Neighbourhood Playhouse School of the Theatre to study performing arts. After persuading her father to pay for her fees – “convincing my father who was a Gaucho to pay for acting school in New York was my best performance ever” – she worked around her studies to cover her living costs. While a career on stage proved not to be her calling, she took an important lesson from her time there. “We studied Meisner technique, which I got,” she says. “It’s the technique of being truthful – of dealing with the truth [it takes] to perform and performing from a place of truth. It was a remarkable experience and without it I wouldn’t be able to do interviews like this or be so present [today].” None of her friends or family are surprised that Hearst ended up as a fashion designer, she says, although she admits to falling into it by coincidence. Before Gabriela Hearst and long before Chloé, came Candela, the womenswear brand she started with two partners and $750 each. “At that point, if it didn’t work out, I would have needed to go back to selling cattle with my dad – so I gave it my all!” she laughs. “I don’t recommend it, but at the time it was like 0% APR and so we maxed out credit cards [to get it started]. Luckily the business went from zero to a million dollars in no time so we were able to pay it off.”
It was Candela that taught Hearst the nitty gritty of supply chains and logistics, for which she is grateful, but ultimately led to disillusion. “We were making [clothes] for the contemporary market at cheap prices and low quality and there was a total disconnect for me.” In 2011, her father died and she inherited his ranch (that she still runs remotely to this day). Finding herself back in Paysandú “working with tradition, organising animals, [watching] the circle of life” she knew something had to change. “I thought about it and I said, ‘If I am going to put something new out there, it needs to be better made and with a lower environmental impact to anything else.” Four years later, and after much research and planning, her brand was born in partnership with her husband, with whom she has three children, Jack, six, and Olivia and Mia, both 13. It was with his encouragement that Hearst pursued the top job at Chloé, which came about in characteristic go-getting style. “I had one of these crazy Gabi moments when I told my future boss, ‘Look, my name is Gabi, just like the founder Gaby [Aghion] so this is it’!” she laughs. “Then of course I did a 92-page presentation and justified my thought process, but it was really meant to be because it’s a language I love.” To achieve a work-life balance while heading up two of the most successful fashion brands in the world is “very challenging”, she says. “But I have a very supportive family. My husband’s responsibilities changed and adapted so there’s definitely sacrifice.”
Living a “moderated” life that includes bed by 9.30pm to get at least eight hours’ sleep a night, exercise and a healthy diet – “I mean, I’ll derail in certain pressure times and eat too many freaking gummy bears and drink too many coffees, sure” – she believes in keeping a clear head so she can “access information from the subconscious” and she picks what takes her away from home carefully. In November, Hearst spent her birthday in Glasgow on a panel at Cop26 talking about achieving climate success through low-impact business models. “To spend your birthday away from your kids is painful and so if I’m going to do it, I really wanted it to be worth it, and it was.” Her work as trustee of Save the Children since 2018 has also turned her attention to Ghana, Kenya and most recently Afghanistan. Not for the first time, she leveraged the exclusivity of her waiting lists and limited-edition designs this December and donated 100% of net proceeds across all items in her flagship stores in London and New York as well as her website to the charity’s Afghanistan Crisis Children’s Relief Fund. “I don’t like it when brands bombard me with gifting lists and things like that,” she says. “The period of the holidays is about giving and consciousness of others, so I’m not comfortable with just selling a product to make more money. Can’t we think of other people? Afghanistan is one of the places that is hell on earth right now and why do those children have to suffer? It may not be on the news now, but that doesn’t mean the problem has been eradicated.” This year, she quietly launched the Gabriela Hearst Youth Program in the States, too, to create a space for teenagers to be able to channel anxieties through teaching them about fabrics and the future of fashion design. One of her proudest accomplishments of the year, it says a lot about Hearst’s motivation for doing everything she does. Two of her main takeaways from the Cop26 summit this year were: “Anyone who fights the youth will lose” and that when it comes to the environment, we’re all supposed to leave our kids better off than when we started. “The mission is all worth it,” she says. “I can honestly say to my kids that I tried, I freaking tried.”";https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/02/fashion-designer-gabriela-hearst-i-could-have-gone-back-to-selling-cattle
5973;5973;Write it All Down by Cathy Rentzenbrink review – an arm around the shoulder for aspiring authors;2022-01-02T11:00:16Z;['Alex Preston'];['Autobiography and memoir', 'Books', 'Culture'];"In the weeks after my grandfather died in 2019, I spent a melancholy few days sorting through the “Gramps” section of my filing cupboard, mainly the many letters he’d sent to me over the years. It was a way, I suppose, of continuing the 40-year conversation we’d had about books, of keeping his voice loud in my mind. One letter struck me with particular force, though – a page and a half in response to a short story I’d sent him aged 10. It was typical of his letters about my writing: warm yet forthright in its criticism, even at this early stage showing something that I came to recognise as a gift – the fact that he took me seriously as an author, that this was feedback from one writer to another. It’s one of the central messages in Cathy Rentzenbrink’s wise and generous book about the writer’s life, Write it All Down; this idea that one of the hardest things for a writer to do is to take themselves and their work seriously. There is, as she acknowledges early on here, an awful lot of snake oil sold in the creative writing industry: “Books that are too focused on structure make me want to cry,” she says. “Their authors seem to enjoy discussing the classical three-act structure, protagonists and antagonists and all that, but it is just too cold a way to go about things for me, and I know it would never lead to anything good.” Write it All Down is not a book that gives you structure; rather it helps the aspirant writer fashion a vessel into which they might safely pour the contents of their heart.
In a series of short, chatty chapters, Rentzenbrink doles out advice that conveys one central message: that in writing, we become writers. This is not a book whose intended audience has had the privilege of a creative writing MA (or a sternly encouraging grandfather); it’s for anyone who picks up a pen, or sits before the ominously blank computer screen, and wonders if they have it in them to write. Rentzenbrink’s own background is salutary: her father was a miner who couldn’t read or write for most of his life. Her youth was marked with tragedy, as recorded in her devastating memoir The Last Act of Love. She is now a furiously productive author – since that memoir in 2015 she has written four other books, including a brilliantly caustic first novel, Everyone Is Still Alive.
Rentzenbrink teaches classes on life writing for Arvon, and at Kestle Barton in Cornwall, and reading Write it All Down feels like a decent second best to being in the classroom with her. She is disarmingly frank about both the limitations of creative writing as an academic discipline – “I don’t have all the answers and don’t believe that anyone does” – and on the challenges of entering an industry that is perhaps the most competitive and least well remunerated of any. Not to mention the physical and mental challenges of getting anything down on paper at all – “almost all writers exist in a continual vortex of despair and doubt”. What Write it All Down does more than anything, though, is to make the reader – the writer! – feel part of a community. Rentzenbrink peppers her work with thoughtful answers to the questions that get in the way of writing: “Should I work if I am ill? What about when depressed? How do I know if I’m doing it right? I keep getting stuck… I’m so confused!” At the end there are messages of solidarity and inspiration from a host of other writers, from Lucy Mangan to Matt Haig to Maggie O’Farrell. They underline the collaborative, confidence-building ethos of the book, which provides an arm around the shoulder as we struggle with that most difficult of things: the “tricky, slippery business” of writing.

5974;5974;Whistleblower warns baffling illness affects growing number of young adults in Canadian province;2022-01-02T11:00:15Z;['Leyland Cecco'];['Canada', 'Neuroscience', 'Medicine', 'Health'];"A whistleblower in the Canadian province of New Brunswick has warned that a progressive neurological illness that has baffled experts for more than two years appears to be affecting a growing number of young people and causing swift cognitive decline among some of the afflicted. Speaking to the Guardian, an employee with Vitalité Health Network, one of the province’s two health authorities, said that suspected cases are growing in number and that young adults with no prior health triggers are developing a catalog of troubling symptoms, including rapid weight loss, insomnia, hallucinations, difficulty thinking and limited mobility. The official number of cases under investigation, 48, remains unchanged since it was first announced in early spring 2021. But multiple sources say the cluster could now be as many as 150 people, with a backlog of cases involving young people still requiring further assessment. “I’m truly concerned about these cases because they seem to evolve so fast,” said the source. “I’m worried for them and we owe them some kind of explanation.” At the same time, at least nine cases have been recorded in which two people in close contact – but without genetic links – have developed symptoms, suggesting that environmental factors may be involved. One suspected case involved a man who was developing symptoms of dementia and ataxia. His wife, who was his caregiver, suddenly began losing sleep and experiencing muscle wasting, dementia and hallucinations. Now her condition is worse than his. A woman in her 30s was described as non-verbal, is feeding with a tube and drools excessively. Her caregiver, a nursing student in her 20s, also recently started showing symptoms of neurological decline. In another case, a young mother quickly lost nearly 60 pounds, developed insomnia and began hallucinating. Brain imaging showed advanced signs of atrophy. The Vitalité employee, who asked not to be named because they were unauthorized to speak publicly and feared repercussions for speaking out, said they decided to come forward because of growing concerns over the speed with which young people have deteriorated. “This is not a New Brunswick disease,” said the employee. “We’re probably the area that is raising the flag because we’re mostly rural and in an area where people might have more exposure to environmental factors.”
But in January, the province of New Brunswick is widely expected to announce that the cluster of cases, first made public last year after a memo was leaked to the media, is the result of misdiagnoses, which have mistakenly grouped unrelated illnesses together. The Special Neurodegenerative Disorder Clinic, also called the Mind Clinic, in the city of Moncton is the clearing house for cases referred from within the region as well as neighbouring provinces. Prospective cases have typically stumped doctors and resisted a battery of standardized neurological tests used to rule out certain conditions. Using a case description guideline developed by a team of neurologists and epidemiologists, the clinic decides if the patients warrant further investigation or if they may have a known illness or disease. Determining who becomes part of the cluster is subjective, largely because the brain is notoriously difficult to study. Certainty is often only obtained after the patient dies and the cerebral tissue can be fully tested. Despite the striking details surrounding the newer cases, the province has worked to tamp down fears. In October, officials suggested that the eight fatal cases were the result of misdiagnosis, arguing that instead of suffering from a shared neurological illness, the victims had died of known and unrelated pathologies. But experts familiar with the cluster are alarmed, largely because of the age of the patients. Neurological illnesses are rare in young people. “The fact that we have a younger spectrum of patients here argues very strongly against what appears to be the preferred position of the government of New Brunswick – that the cases in this cluster are being mistakenly lumped together,” said a scientist at the Canada’s public health agency, who specializes in neurodegenerative illnesses but was unauthorized to speak. In October the province also said an epidemiological report suggested there was no significant evidence of any known food, behaviour or environmental exposure that could explain the illness. Tim Beatty’s father Laurie, a retired hardware employee, died in 2019 after the onset of mental confusion around Christmas marked the beginning of his rapid deterioration. Beatty says the family was “gobsmacked” when he learned his father was one of eight people a pathologist controversially declared was improperly diagnosed and had instead died of Alzheimer’s. Beatty and his sister have pleaded to have their father’s remains tested for neurotoxins, including β-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), which some have suggested could be the culprit behind the illness. In one study, high concentrations of BMAA were found in lobster, an industry that drives the economies of many of New Brunswick’s coastal communities. The province’s apparent resistance to testing for suspected environmental factors has led to speculation among families that the efforts to rule out the existence of a cluster could be motivated by political decision making. “If a group of people wanted to breed conspiracy theorists, then our government has done a wonderful job at promoting it,” said Beatty. “Are they just trying to create a narrative for the public that they hope we’ll absorb and walk away from? I just don’t understand it.” Documents obtained through freedom of information requests and seen by the Guardian showed scientists at the country’s public health agency were considering BMAA as a possible cause, but needed the province to order the testing. “I don’t know why the province wouldn’t just simply do the science and look. They have my dad’s remains. We’ve given them full permission to do toxicology and do what needs to be done,” said Beatty. “Yet, nothing has been looked at.” But experts nonetheless warn that testing itself is also more difficult than the public realizes. While some medical tests can provide quick and definite results other types of investigation require far more work. “What people are talking about really amounts to a full research investigation, because then we know what we’re looking for precisely,” said the federal scientist who was familiar with both the cluster and the testing process. “Right now we don’t have a way to interpret simple data that you might get when testing a person’s brain tissue for a particular toxin. For example, how much are ‘elevated’ levels of a neurotoxin compared to the rest of the public? And when does that become a cause for concern?” The scientist said teams are ready to begin the research, but “New Brunswick has specifically told us not to go forward with that work”. Those familiar with the cluster are bracing for a January report, written by the province’s oversight committee, which will determine if the 48 cases are genuinely suffering from a neurological illness or the result of misdiagnosis by neurologists. Amid mounting tension between specialists and the provincial government, a source familiar with the Mind Clinic say the postings for several jobs at the clinic – a social worker, an administrator and a neuropsychologist – were recently made temporary, the budget would no longer be recurrent and the clinic would be converted into a Alzheimer’s and geriatric clinic. Health minister Dorothy Shephard told reporters on 1 December that speculation the clinic would be shut down was untrue. “We keep telling the patients that the country is behind them, and that the tests will be done so that we can figure this out. We tell them we will get to the bottom of this so that we can help them,” said the Vitalité employee. “And so far, that hasn’t happened. But they need us.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/neurological-illness-affecting-young-adults-canada
5975;5975;The Electrical Life of Louis Wain review – a portrait of the artist as a delusional cat lover;2022-01-02T11:00:15Z;['Wendy Ide'];['Biopics', 'Drama films', 'Film', 'Culture', 'Art and design', 'Benedict Cumberbatch', 'Claire Foy'];"A hundred-plus years before cat memes became ubiquitous, the work of the artist Louis Wain was the advance guard in a feline charm offensive. His playful, anthropomorphised illustrations of grinning kittens took Victorian society by storm. This suitably eccentric biopic from director Will Sharpe (written by Simon Stephenson and Sharpe), with Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role, takes Wain’s art as an initial visual key, but goes further, using everything from a heightened palette to woozy Dutch camera angles to shimmering auras to convey Wain’s unsteady mental state. The artist was, not to put too fine a point on it, delusional. As the film tells it, he believed that cats were evolving to communicate with humans, and that they would ultimately turn blue; he was obsessed with the idea of electricity, but believed it to be a free-floating entity that drifted around the ether. But in all the churning chaos in Wain’s mind, there was a place of calm reserved for his wife, Emily (Claire Foy). Through her, and their all-too-brief marriage, he was able to tune out the noise and into the beauty of the world around him. Like Wain’s art, the film is superficially twee – characters are referred to as “nosy poseys” at one point – but under the kitsch is something more rewarding: an affecting portrait of a creative but troubled man.

5977;5977;‘I’m always tired, Miss’: the sleepless children of Leeds’ bed poverty crisis;2022-01-02T10:40:38Z;['Richard Adams'];['Poverty', 'Children', 'Schools', 'Education', 'Leeds', 'Social exclusion', 'Society', 'UK news', 'Voluntary sector', 'Charities'];"Real heroes don’t wear capes, but they do bring duvets. Such as Bex Wilson and her dad, Mark, who spent the night before Christmas bringing beds and duvets to children who would otherwise have been sleeping on the floor or in a bathtub. “It surprises people how many kids in Leeds don’t have beds. It surprised me,” said Wilson. On Christmas Eve alone, the pair delivered beds to 17 children across Leeds. It would have been 21 beds but one family had a bug infestation so bad it was better to wait before delivering new ones. The week before Christmas, the charity Wilson founded with friends delivered 50 beds. Since 2018 the organisation, Zarach, has given more than 1,400 beds, mattresses, duvets and sheets to families and children who had little prospect of getting them any other way. A teacher at a primary school in Burmantofts, Leeds, Wilson was stunned to find that children in her classes were living in such desperate circumstances. “There was a little boy who was normally fine, and he was having a bad morning, being moody and short with his classmates. So I said to him at the end of the lesson, are you OK? Are you tired? And he just said: ‘I’m always tired, Miss, I don’t have a bed.’ That’s exactly how he said it. “I couldn’t believe it and said, what do you mean you don’t have a bed? And he pulled up his jumper and showed me infected sores on his stomach that were bed bug bites, from him and his brother and his sister sharing an infested sofa cushion on the floor in his house.” Not able to believe the lack of support, even in a city such as Leeds with all its resources, Wilson decided to act. Her father had a van and a connection to a bed factory, so after consulting her headteacher and the pupil’s mother, she set off.
“I honestly thought then that I’d go into this house and there would be a space in each bedroom where the beds should go, and that I’d feel like a super teacher for delivering these beds,” she said. “But when we went in the house to deliver the beds, the only thing in the house was one white plastic garden chair. There was no other furniture. I thought, they must have just moved in. But the mum explained that they had been there for months. “It was quite late when we got there. The mum got up on the white plastic chair and took the lightbulb out of the socket in the downstairs living room, and she went upstairs and put it in there because she only had one working light bulb.”
The mother, a single parent, had been the victim of fraud and moved to an unfurnished house to save money. Wilson found there was no food in the house other than some milk. “I left absolutely shell-shocked, that a child I’d been teaching for weeks and known for a long time, that this was what he was living through. It changed the rest of my life.” A few weeks later the mother appeared at the school gates and pressed some cash into Wilson’s hand. “I said I don’t want paying back, and she said: ‘No, I’m giving you this so that you can buy them for some other families like mine.’” Wilson said she resisted the idea of starting a charity to provide beds. “I thought: there can’t be that many kids without beds, it’s 21st-century Britain. How bad can it be?” But previous research by the Buttle UK trust ranked Leeds as one of the worst areas for “bed poverty” in the UK, with more than 5,000 children in the city living without beds. A nagging feeling that something needed to be done led Wilson and some friends to set up Zarach, but they found themselves having to make difficult decisions: “There were many times when we were weighing up, well this child is sleeping in the bathtub or this child is sleeping on a beanbag, but we’d only got money to buy a bed for one.” While Wilson remains a committed full-time teacher and deputy head, support for Zarach has grown so that it can afford to pay a small number of staff and has expanded to offer food clubs, emergency gas and electricity supplies, a school uniform exchange and holiday projects. The Covid pandemic has led to an increase in demand, in particular from the number of families fleeing domestic abuse, according to Wilson.
“I went to a house last week, there was no carpet, no furniture, no curtains on any windows, just nothing, a couple of bin liners of clothes, and that was it. But the parent was so happy – she said: ‘I feel like I’ve won the lottery, I’ve been living in a hotel for six months with three children in one room, because I fled domestic abuse, and I’ve just been given this house by the council in time for Christmas.’” While local authorities do their best, Wilson says they are overwhelmed by the demands they face. Zarach has now expanded outside Leeds, to Dewsbury in West Yorkshire and Romford in east London, where it hopes to apply the lessons Wilson and her colleagues have learned. Zarach, Wilson explains, is the Hebrew word for rising light, from a verse in the book of Isaiah that helping the hungry and oppressed rises a light in the darkness. The inspiration came from the first mother, who needed to move her only lightbulb for the bed delivery. “She said: ‘You were the light in my darkest day, and I’ll never forget that.’ And that’s what I wanted everything that Zarach did to try and be, to bring hope in desperate situations.”";https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/02/leeds-bed-poverty-crisis-bex-wilson-zarach

Thanks to a 30-year restoration programme of the garden, the grounds of this 28-acre estate in the Scottish borders are generously filled with them, and the nature trail is free for everyone. Other highlights include a walled garden dating from the 16th century, and 19th-century Cringletie House has 16 delightful rooms, afternoon tea and warming fires. Doubles from £250 B&B, cringletie.com Walsingham Abbey, Norfolk
Mixed in with the ruins of a 13th-century ruined monastery, this is one of East Anglia’s best places to surround yourself with snowdrops. Spread over 18 acres, including by an ancient packhorse bridge, woods and under the Dell Gate, millions of snowdrops have divided and thrived over the centuries. The neighbouring village of Little Walsingham also embraces snowdrops in its gardens and greens, and the Black Lion is a poshed-up pub with rooms (doubles from £125 B&B). Adult £6, walsinghamabbey.com Easton Walled Gardens, Lincolnshire
On a sunny day, areas of Easton are sheltered enough for a snowdrop’s delicate honeyed scent to emerge. A snowdrop sanctuary for more than 500 years, Easton’s gardens open again on 11 February 2022, with cafés and shops in addition to 12 acres of bulb-filled grounds. For those who want to linger, cabins with views across the snowdrops are available for the day for up to six people, with chairs and blankets. Linger longer in Easton’s coach house, converted into three open-plan apartments (from £80 a night), or its gate house (from £92; sawdays.co.uk) for access to the gardens after the day visitors have left.

Possibly introduced by the Romans, beloved by medieval monks and seized on by Victorians, winter-flowering snowdrops (Galanthus) are the first heralds of coming spring. This National Trust estate, with the remains of a 13th-century priory, Jacobean mansion, water mill and gardens, has one of Britain’s best collections – more than 2,000 varieties of the delicately drooping white flower. Of particular note is the rare Galanthus lagodechianus, discovered by former head gardener Richard Ayres on the site of the garden’s Victorian rubbish heap, which can now be seen in all its snowy glory. Adult from £10, nationaltrust.org.uk Castle Bromwich Hall Gardens, West Midlands
Brum’s best snowdrops can be found in the gardens of this Jacobean mansion; their flowering marks the arrival of spring and is celebrated by family days at the weekend.

5979;5979;Betting billionaire’s charity cuts donations from £9m to £6m;2022-01-02T10:00:14Z;['Rob Davies'];['Gambling', 'Sport betting', 'Charities', 'UK news', 'Coronavirus', 'Business'];"A charity founded by Denise Coates, the billionaire boss of online gambling firm Bet365, has reduced its donations to good causes from £9m to £6m, despite its reserves swelling by almost 50% to £568m. Accounts filed at Companies House detail the charitable activity of the foundation set up by Coates, Britain’s best-paid woman, whose £421m pay-and-dividend package for 2020 took her earnings beyond £1bn in four years. Divisions of her Stoke-based Bet365 empire donated £100m to the Denise Coates Foundation in the year to 28 March 2021, the accounts show, while investments held by the charity grew in value by £86.5m. The twin windfalls meant that the reserves of the charity, founded in 2014, soared from £385.3m to £568.4m, a rise of 48%. The volume of charitable donations declined, however, falling from £9m in 2020 to £6.2m. The accounts state that donations were “constrained” because the organisations the charity funds have been restricted in their activities. The volume of grants was expected to “bounce back” in future years, the foundation said. While the reserves of the Denise Coates Foundation increased by £183m, according to the accounts, the charities regulator does not have strict policies on how much should be held relative to donations. Charity Commission guidance published in 2016 stresses there is “no single level, or even a range of, reserves that is right for all charities”. According to the guidance, organisations with bigger reserves than necessary could re-examine spending and “trustees must consider whether the purposes of the charity should be amended to enable the charity to operate more effectively”. The Denise Coates Foundation does address the volume of reserves it holds in comments attached to its accounts. It states that the charity’s policy is to use the donations it receives from the Coates family business empire to build up its reserves of cash and investments, which rose from £385.3m to £568.3m. Any income and gains on investments is then distributed over the course of one to five years. “This policy should allow the foundation to operate on an enduring basis without being dependent on donations from any one source,” the accounts state. During the year, the charity increased the amount of “unrestricted” funds available for donations by £15.5m to £20.2m. Donations made in 2021 included £1.9m to University Hospitals of North Midlands, the NHS trust in Stoke-on-Trent, the home of the Coates family, who own Stoke City football club and have based Bet365 there. In April last year, Denise Coates, who is worth more than £8bn together with her family, announced a £10m donation to the trust, to support staff battling the coronavirus pandemic. Overall, the foundation made 17 donations to 12 institutions, including a £500,000 grant to the Chronic Disease Research Foundation to research Covid-19. Other recipients include the Douglas Macmillan Hospice, which received £300,000 to help fund care for 137 patients. The charity also gave £200,000 towards a Covid-19 appeal launched by Catholic overseas development organisation Cafod and £300,000 towards Kick4Life, a project building a sports stadium in Lesotho to promote social change. The charity did not make any donations to charities tackling gambling-related harm, either this year or last. Like other gambling companies, Bet365 donates to gambling-related charities via a voluntary industry-wide levy, which campaigners have said should be mandatory, in order to address the lack of treatment options for gambling addicts in the UK.
The company’s roots are in the network of bookmaking operations started by Peter Coates in Stoke-on-Trent. His daughter Denise is credited with spotting the opportunities offered by taking bets online, building Bet365 into a pioneering and hugely profitable betting firm with global reach. Bet365 reported an 8% fall in revenue to £2.81bn last year, partly due to the cancellation of sporting events due to the Covid pandemic. Operating profit fell by 74% to £194.7m, down from £758.3m in 2019.

5980;5980;The night I met Christ at a bus stop in Dalston | Stewart Lee;2022-01-02T10:00:14Z;['Stewart Lee'];['Poverty', 'Priti Patel', 'Homelessness', 'Society'];"“The poor are always with us. So speaks the man who has not learned to use a whip correctly!” And also thus spake the unsung genius comedian Simon Munnery, in character in his 90s parody of impotent bedsit fascism, The League Against Tedium. The act seems arguably less satirical today as its best lines have become actual government thinking. What is Priti Patel’s proposed Channel migrant policy if not, however it is dressed up in the sterile language of info-deterrence and reasonable force and common sense and re-seized sovereignty and taking back control, merely cudgelling children back into the cold sea to die, the Kindertransport in satanic reverse? But what are we to do with the poor, who have the temerity to seem especially visible over the festive season, the smelly bastards? A week before Christmas, I waited in the small hours at a bus stop outside Dalston’s Rio cinema, having spoken at the Covid-decimated London premiere of a film I wrote, King Rocker (“the new gold standard for rockumentaries” – the Scotsman). A babbling woman in a bobble hat approached me for money and, it being Christmas, I fished in my pocket. After all, it was highly likely the exuberant lich was in fact a manifestation of Christ himself, come to test my generosity, something that I am convinced has happened to me on several previous occasions. I would not banish this Dalston Christ to the lowly stable. I would welcome her at my Christmas Inn of Spare Change. For I am a good man. Sadly, the only cash I had on me was a sizable Scottish £10 note, having just got back from Glasgow, which I was reluctant to part with. Even the disguised Christ would probably consider such ostentatious generosity over the top, the work of a whited sepulchre. I’m not made of money, especially after two years of no live gigs and the cost of the resultant need to drink heavily in order to compensate for the withdrawal of the massed nightly adoration of strangers. Nonetheless, I didn’t see any way out of the increasingly awkward situation except to hand the money over, as I was wary of being judged as ungenerous by the other two people at the bus stop, who might also have been further manifestations of the Christ. Perhaps they were appearing together as the holy trinity: the father, the son and the babbling woman in the bobble hat? “What the fuck is this?” said my beggar Christ, angrily, on receiving the money, divine but nonetheless a Cockney, and thus culturally baffled by unfamiliar sterling, and also excellent at swearing. “It’s a Scottish £10 note,” I said, before adding: “If you can’t use it I’ll have it back,” sensing a way of getting my money returned while nonetheless having made the kind of generous offer that would secure me a decent placing in St Peter’s judgmental ledger. “No, no, you’re all right,” said Christ, scuttling off into the Dalston dark with my Scotch dosh. But the dilemmas didn’t end there.
“I’ll have a tenner if you’re giving them away,” shouted a tall man at the other end of the bus stop, angrily. “I didn’t mean to give her £10, it was all I had,” I said, defensively, realising it was possible to interpret my unintended generosity as offensively profligate. But then, realising the man may also be yet another Christ, attempting to provoke me into revoking the moral worth of my charity, I quickly added: “But it is Christmas, so if you can’t give a beggar £10 at Christmas when can you?” But the angry Christ continued. “They just spend it on crack. That’s where she’s gone now, to a crack den. You’re a fucking idiot.” Then an old woman Christ, who until now had been sitting quietly on the artfully angled bus sheltered seat, “defensively designed” to be just too thin and too slippery to enable a homeless person to sleep on it, piped up: “It’s fucking Christmas, let him give his fucking money to whoever he wants.” This, of course, would be exactly what Christ would say, albeit in less-colourful language. Could both my Dalston bus-stop debaters be Christ? Yes, if you subscribe to the Manichaean doctrine of dualism, made manifest here tonight, an inexplicable theological survival, in this east London street. The angry man and the kind woman continued to argue with each other as my bus arrived and I slipped away unnoticed, leaving behind me a scatological street-level reimagining of Radio 4’s bloodless Moral Maze, passionate debate replacing masturbatory self-congratulation, educated arrogance and Baroness Fox. But what is to be done? Will it be the be-jumpered LadBaby, loyally singing about inoffensive sausage rolls at No 1 for the Trussell Trust food banks every Christmas for all eternity now, without addressing the roots of the poverty their offal-inclusive songs seek temporarily to alleviate? Or will the novelty-single-loving British public join the dots and condemn the policies that create the need for both food banks, and the meat and pastry music of LadBaby, and vote out those responsible, who explicitly see wealth as a reward for virtue and poverty as punishment for laziness? On its website, the Trussell Trust’s own “strategic plan” is cautious to avoid direct political comment, anxious, I expect, to avoid being made into a culture war pawn by the usual unscrupulous bad faith operators on the right. Shadows take my hand and mist is on the land. Do we just wait until Christ comes back, with his baked-bean hampers and his top-down plan to end poverty? Until then, we live in a crumbling city built not on rock, but on sausage rolls.

5981;5981;Villagers fight to keep BBC Victorian Farm in business;2022-01-02T10:00:14Z;['James Tapper'];['Museums', 'Farming', 'History', 'Media', 'Culture', 'Education', 'BBC', 'Agriculture and forestry', 'UK news', 'E coli', 'Coronavirus'];"Of the handful of historic working farms in the UK, Acton Scott Farm is perhaps the best known. The Shropshire farm was the setting for the BBC series Victorian Farm, and generations of schoolchildren have visited the rolling Shropshire hills to see the shire horses plough the fields and the dairymaid milk the cows. Yet the future of the farm is in serious doubt. Shropshire council, which runs the farm, shut it down in June after an outbreak of E coli and there are no plans to reopen it. In the coming weeks, the council will launch a consultation inviting the public to come up with ideas about how to fund Acton Scott Farm, which it says loses £168,000 a year. But campaigners are desperate to ensure the survival of England’s first historic working farm, where workers in period costume demonstrate traditional skills and use horse-drawn ploughs to work the land and manage the rare breed livestock.
Already there are concerns among the villagers in Church Stretton that the decision has in effect been taken. Shropshire council’s cabinet had been due to consider an “options appraisal” in November, but the decision was delayed by the byelection caused by Owen Paterson’s resignation as the MP for North Shropshire. This month’s consultation was announced only after a local campaign had begun. Some of the farm animals have already been sold. The flock of six pygmy goats is gone. Of the five Gloucester Old Spot pigs, only two are left. The Shropshire sheep, the Dairy Shorthorn cattle and the pair of magnificent shire horses remain, as do the ducks, geese and chickens, although they are in lockdown to avoid becoming infected with bird flu. Shropshire council said that animals are sold regularly as part of the farm’s stock management programme and the majority of the rare breed animals have remained. The campaign to save the farm was started by Alice Walker, a barmaid in Church Stretton who has been a regular visitor since she was a child. “It’s a really special place,” she said. “You can see them tacking up the horses and ploughing the ground, then drilling it with old drills. We have visitors from all over – Australia, America – there’s a big Canadian following.”
The farm was founded in 1975 by Tom Acton, whose family has owned the farm estate for more than 900 years. His ancestor, Richard Acton, built the family’s Elizabethan manor house in 1580. Acton, who died last year aged 95, had been keen to retain traditional farm methods and had built a collection of Victorian seed drills and ploughs. It was picked by the BBC for Victorian Farm, a series charting a year when the historian Ruth Goodman and archaeologists Alex Langlands and Peter Ginn lived on the farm reliving the experience of Victorian farmers. The farm also offers training and qualifications in traditional rural crafts and trades, from stone masonry to wheelwrighting, and Walker did an NVQ there when she was young. “We started to hear whispers,” Walker said. “We had the Covid closures, and then the E coli outbreak. I thought it was slipping off the radar and it might have closed without anybody realising it was even an option. So I started a group. “I thought it would be me and my mum shouting in a room, but we had 1,000 Facebook members in less than a month.” The group has had all sorts of support – from a woman whose mother donated her old English game chickens to the farm when it opened to people whose grandfather was educated in the schoolhouse.
The Rare Breed Survival Trust has also offered its support, and the chief executive, Christopher Price, wrote to the council last month, urging it to “ensure that the farm remains safeguarded for the future”. The E coli outbreak in June involved two visits and a council health and safety report recommended “essential works” costing £130,000 were required. Shropshire council said that visitor numbers peaked at around 45,000 a year in 2009, when Victorian Farm first aired. However, since then, numbers have fallen to an average of 20,000 a year since 2014, the council said. A spokesperson said: “Shropshire council, like many other local authorities, is facing an extremely challenging financial future and it is in this climate that an options appraisal has been undertaken to determine whether an alternative commercially viable model is achievable.” Cecilia Motley, Shropshire council’s cabinet member for communities, culture, leisure and tourism, and transport, said: “Shropshire council recognises the value Acton Scott holds for many people and is committed to supporting the landowners and the local community over the coming months and we look forward to hearing thoughts and suggestions when we open discussion in the new year.” Francis Acton, for the Acton Scott Estate, said: “It is clear that there is a large community who have a great affection for the historic working farm. The Acton family will support the consultation and work with Shropshire council to explore future options.”";https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/02/villagers-fight-to-keep-bbc-victorian-farm-in-business
5982;5982;Can you capture the complex reality of the pandemic with numbers? Well, we tried… | David Spiegelhalter and Anthony Masters;2022-01-02T10:00:14Z;['David Spiegelhalter', 'Anthony Masters'];['Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'World news', 'Science'];"Individual experiences and suffering are, of course, at the heart of the pandemic. But one way to understand what has happened is through putting those experiences together – and statistics are those personal stories writ large. And this pandemic has brought unprecedented demand to explain all the numbers that have been flying around. This has not been without its problems and we’ve had to learn some hard lessons, such as the journalistic skill of brevity. Since January 2021, we’ve been writing a weekly column in this paper about Covid numbers, covering everything from infections to deaths, vaccines to mental health, masks to lockdowns. It can be frustrating not being able to show all the graphs, but the same holds for radio and TV interviews and More or Less on Radio 4 has shown how much can be done to explain statistics without visual aids. Mathematical formulae and technical jargon need to be avoided, but we have also had to be sparing with numbers, which is harder when they are so precious to us. We had to agree our purpose, as a particular challenge is to fend off the voracious media appetite for blame, speculation and controversy, naturally fed by the broad spectrum of opinion among experts. One camp has supported viral suppression and even elimination, while others have expressed scepticism about the measures taken; it’s become a cliche that their extreme followers can be identified by the phrase “I’ve done my own research”. In the theatre of political combat, numbers are often weapons to beat opponents, but they should really be used to raise the quality of the debate. So we see ourselves as part of a group who have attempted to keep away from policy disputes and some of our most trusted sources are skilled individuals doing analyses in their spare time, who then share their insights on Twitter – to inform rather than persuade. Unfortunately, this pandemic has been rife with false claims and misinformation, particularly about vaccines. One approach for dealing with this, supported by empirical evidence, is the idea of “inoculation” – pre-empting misinformation and telling people about the incorrect interpretation before they catch it in the wild.
We tried this strategy back in June 2021 when Public Health England first published data showing that, among older people who had recently died with Covid-19, most had been vaccinated. We wrote an article pointing out that this did not mean the vaccine was ineffective – just that it was imperfect – and that the great majority of people had been vaccinated: in essence, a small proportion of a large number can be bigger than a larger proportion of a small number. Another useful analogy is with seatbelts: most people who die in car accidents are wearing seatbelts, but this does not mean that seatbelts are not effective – it’s just that nearly everyone wears one and they are not perfect. The response to our “pre-bunking” was not encouraging. The Twitter link to our article included only its title, Why most people who now die with Covid in England have had a vaccination, and not the subhead, Don’t think of this as a bad sign, it’s exactly what’s expected from an effective but imperfect jab. As such, it was mistakenly interpreted as an anti-vaccination article (or worse) and circulated online. This, in turn, led to critical comments suggesting that we had encouraged vaccine scepticism and even an extraordinary tweet saying we (and the paper’s editors) were “genocidal” and should be “hunted down and destroyed”. We made light of this, saying this seemed a bit harsh, but we had had worse referees’ reports. That account was subsequently removed from Twitter. Among the repeatable insults, DS has been called an “idiot”, a “shameless liar” and “Nazi collaborator”. Of course, this is mild compared to what others have received (although “fossil” did hurt).
It got more complicated in September 2021 when ITV’s political editor, Robert Peston, tweeted (and later deleted) “Infections higher among double vaxxed for those 40 to 79 than for non-vaxxed”. Surprisingly, he was not referring to the absolute case numbers, which could be explained using the reasoning above. Instead, this referred to the case rates per 100,000 people reported by Public Health England. That seems strange, but can be explained by PHE’s use of National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) for population figures, which uses GP lists and so tends to overcount due to many and defunct registrations. Using Office for National Statistics (ONS) population estimates, themselves uncertain, leads to the expected lower case-rates in vaccinated than unvaccinated groups. This UK data, apparently showing higher case rates in the vaccinated than the unvaccinated, was later used by Brazil’s President Bolsonaro to support his bizarre claim that vaccines cause Aids. Complaints by the watchdog Office for Statistics Regulation have had little impact and PHE’s successor, the UK Health Security Agency, stubbornly refuses to change its publication (even though unvaccinated rates are in a lighter font), so that these misleading numbers continue to feed vaccine misinformation. These stories might give a poor impression of how the media has handled Covid-19 numbers. But, on balance, our impression is that a valiant attempt has been made by most outlets to explain their complexities. All, of course, impossible without the extraordinary behind-the-scenes work of those who produce the Covid dashboard, the ONS Infection Survey, and the other sources that it is too easy to take for granted. We started working together through the Royal Statistical Society, since statisticians care deeply about the use of numerical evidence in public debate. Data does not speak for itself – it needs people to speak honestly and carefully on its behalf. A misunderstood statistic could have terrible consequences – in health, wealth and justice. By contrast, better statistics should lead to better debate and, we hope, better decisions. • David Spiegelhalter is chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge.

5983;5983;Female conductor takes the helm in first for Italian opera;2022-01-02T09:51:41Z;['Angela Giuffrida'];['Opera', 'Italy', 'Women', 'Culture', 'Music', 'Conducting'];"A female conductor will take the helm at an Italian opera house for the first time in January. The Ukrainian conductor Oksana Lyniv said she was surprised to learn she was making history after receiving the offer from the Teatro Comunale opera house in Bologna. The 43-year-old begins the three-year posting as musical director this month. “I didn’t realise, when I received the letter from the Teatro Comunale, that I would be the first female conductor of an Italian opera house,” she said. “I am very honoured and happy to be part of this historical turning point.” It is not the first time Lyniv, who was previously principal conductor of Austria’s Graz Opera, has broken new ground. In July, she became the first female conductor to open Germany’s Bayreuth opera festival in its 145-year-history. She conducted Richard Wagner’s Flying Dutchman to a rapturous audience that included the former German chancellor Angela Merkel.
Born in Brody, western Ukraine, to musician parents, Lyniv conducted her first orchestra at the age of 16 before going on to study at the Lysenko music school in Lviv. She said it was difficult for female musicians to get on at the time as the majority of conductors and teachers were male. “There was no live example of a woman who we could learn or get advice from,” Lyniv added. “But it is less of a struggle now – in orchestras today you see many more women. The conditions are much better now as society is thinking more about equal rights – so young female conductors should not hold back, they should grab the opportunities and go for it.” Lyniv said Italy was “a very important place for the arts and opera” and that “it’s important that this change is happening now”. Her first opera production will be Andrea Chénier by Umberto Giordano and she will also conduct the music of some of her favourite composers, including Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Bruckner, Richard Strauss and the Ukrainian composer Boris Lyatoshinsky. Bologna’s Teatro Comunale opened its doors in 1763 with a performance of Christoph Willibald Gluck’s Il trionfo di Clelia (The Triumph of Cloelia), and went on to host Wagner as well as some of Italy’s greatest composers, including Verdi, Rossini and Bellini. Lyniv said that one of her goals during her tenure would be to get more young people interested in the opera.";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/02/female-conductor-oksana-lyniv-takes-helm-italian-opera
5984;5984;"The week in TV: A Very British Scandal; The Tourist; Around the World in 80 Days; Stay Close";2022-01-02T09:30:14Z;['Barbara Ellen'];['Drama', 'Television', 'Claire Foy', 'Paul Bettany', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Jamie Dornan', 'David Tennant'];"A Very British Scandal (BBC One) | iPlayer The Tourist (BBC One) | iPlayer Around The World in 80 Days (BBC One) | iPlayer Stay Close (Netflix) | netflix.com Four very different dramas got us through that zone between Christmas and new year that can feel as though your soul is a half-masticated blini hurtling into the void. BBC One’s three-part A Very British Scandal, written by Sarah Phelps and directed by Anne Sewitsky, told the real-life story of unrepentant “scarlet woman” Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll (Claire Foy), whose vicious 1963 divorce from the Duke of Argyll (Paul Bettany) featured a notorious photograph of her fellating a mysterious (headless) lover. Here, then, is another high-end soapy serving of sexed-up British history (2018’s A Very English Scandal dealt with the Jeremy Thorpe affair), with Foy as an intriguing duchess. The appeal of her Elizabeth in The Crown was as a young housewife-queen: flustered, blushing, eager to please. Margaret is just as porcelain-skinned, but also glacial, sexual, a pouting wolf. The decadence is there when she and her future husband flirt up a storm on a train. Less so when she attends the sex party of her aristo-friend Maureen (a viperish Julia Davis), where debauchery is represented by a somewhat tragic clockwork penis trundling across a table top (toff-swinging, it seems, wasn’t all it was cracked up to be). Later, Margaret rounds on Maureen for mocking her sexual appetite, snapping: “I do like it. I like it very much. And I’m extremely good at it.” A Very British Scandal isn’t really about sex; it’s about the hypocrisy surrounding sex. It’s also about cut-glass savagery. The duke, acidly played by Bettany, is vile, druggy, violent and after Margaret’s money. Margaret stammers helplessly in front of her scathing mother (Phoebe Nicholls, chilly and superb). After the duke steals the photographs, and the divorce turns even more rancid, Margaret is expelled from elite circles: “We will close ranks.” There are no innocents here: Margaret, the third wife, forges letters to try to get his sons disinherited. Though she was an early victim of media-shaming, she’s too haughty and entitled to break your heart. Wisely, Foy doesn’t focus on making Margaret sympathetic; instead she makes her human – complex, messy, bold. You’re rooting for her as she sticks out her chin in court and admits to being the woman in the photograph. Within a few short years, the 60s would be swinging; sure, predominantly for men, but free spirits like Margaret may have benefited. She may not be a perfect fit for feminist or heroine, but she was a woman born cruelly out of time. Harry and Jack Williams (The Missing, Liar) wrote The Tourist, an Australian-set, six-part thriller starring Jamie Dornan (The Fall) and directed by Chris Sweeney and Daniel Nettheim. It starts out like a homage to Steven Spielberg’s 1971 film Duel. Dornan is driving alone in the sweaty, hazy outback when he’s menaced by a dusty truck with an unseen driver – all we see is a boot pressing on a pedal. After being rammed off the road, Dornan wakes up in hospital, with amnesia, as the Man. When he goes to a meeting in a diner he has written on a scrap of paper, he narrowly avoids being blown up.
From there, The Tourist is a blur of mysteries: who is the Man? Does he genuinely have amnesia? Who’s the other guy we see buried alive in the desert? Other characters drift through: Danielle Macdonald (Dumplin’, Unbelievable) as a self-effacing, underestimated cop you could imagine ambling about in Fargo; Shalom Brune-Franklin (Line of Duty) as a waitress who seems more involved than she’s letting on. Dornan convinces as the good guy who could be a bad guy, and there’s a rough, homemade feel to the proceedings that at times turns nightmarish, hallucinatory. The outback scenes burn through the screen, grimy and desperate. Tension builds as the Man manoeuvres his wheelchair down a dark hospital corridor. I have only seen the opener, but already The Tourist feels taut, jagged and distinctive, the best Williams offering since The Missing. Sadly, watching the opening two episodes of Around the World in 80 Days (BBC One) felt like it took 80 days. Set in 1872, this eight-part version of the Jules Verne story about the gentleman-adventurer, dramatised by Ashley Pharoah and Caleb Ranson, stars David Tennant: a good actor (so scary in Des), but his Phileas Fogg is so underpowered, navel-gazing, feeble, it’s a surprise he can cross the road unaided, never mind take on wagers to circumnavigate the globe.
The onus is on Fogg’s companions – Ibrahim Koma as roguish valet Passepartout; Leonie Benesch as an intrepid journalist – to provide the vim: first amid Paris riots, then on board an Italian train as, with Fogg’s ingenuity, they cross a wrecked bridge to save a child’s life. I rather enjoyed the brazen anachronisms: “I need a man like a fish needs a penny farthing!” However, the excitement of the hot-air balloon – the first sighting, the maiden voyage – is dampened by soggy Fogg’s lachrymose yearning to prove himself: “No man in the world knows more about lost opportunity than me.” Less hot air from Fogg and more into the balloon, and this series might yet take off. Over on Netflix, Stay Close, adapted by Harlan Coben from his novel, is an eight-part thriller about hunting a serial killer from the same team, including writer Danny Brocklehurst, that made Coben’s The Stranger for Netflix in 2020.
The ever-brilliant Cush Jumbo (The Good Fight) plays a woman who has fled her past but finds it catching up with her. James Nesbitt (The Missing) is a morose cop who falls for Sarah Parish’s earthy bar manager. Richard Armitage, who was also in The Stranger, turns up as a dishevelled photographer, and Eddie Izzard is a lawyer with a social conscience. Stay Close is slick, bullishly fast-paced and – spoiler alert – features antiheroes, played by Hyoie O’Grady and Poppy Gilbert, who make Killing Eve’s Villanelle seem eminently reasonable. I guessed the killer early on, but that didn’t stop me enjoying it. Coben knows how to make plots bounce, swerve and tantalise until the finish. What else I’m watching Death to 2021 (Netflix) This annual roundup, co-executive-produced by Charlie Brooker, is getting heat for jokes about the “Duke of Deadinburgh”. With pops at Trump, anti-vaxxers and Jeff Bezos, and contributors including Hugh Grant and Diane Morgan, it’s better (sharper) than last year.

Did ancient humans wipe out mammoths? Quite possibly.

5985;5985;Out with the meat, in with the plants as world’s top chefs offer vegan menus;2022-01-02T09:30:14Z;['Miranda Bryant'];['Restaurants', 'Chefs', 'Food', 'Vegan food and drink', 'Veganism', 'Life and style', 'UK news'];"Alexis Gauthier used to sell 20kg of foie gras a week. Now the chef, whose London-based restaurant became entirely vegan in 2021, only sells a plant-based version. Since becoming vegan, he admits, Gauthier Soho has “lost a lot of customers, sadly”. But he says he has gained even more new diners, all looking for something different and sustainable and prepared to pay the price. Gauthier is not the only chef to abandon the animal produce traditionally associated with fine dining. While the number of meat-free menus has been burgeoning for some time in lower- and mid-priced restaurants, now a growing number of the world’s top chefs are starting to put plants centre stage. Chef Daniel Humm has created headlines on both sides of the Atlantic twice in recent months. First when he announced that his three Michelin-starred New York restaurant, Eleven Madison Park, would be reopening after a pandemic hiatus in June minus meat or seafood on its $335 menu (but not completely free of animal products. “The current food system is simply not sustainable,” he said).
Then, in November, it was announced that he had parted ways with five-star hotel Claridge’s after it rejected his “bold new vision” of a fully plant-based menu for its restaurant, Davies and Brook, which serves, amongst other things, foie gras and caviar. The hotel said it was “not the path we wish to follow”. And in January, Geranium in Copenhagen, ranked number two by the World’s 50 Best Restaurants, will unveil a new meat-free menu of vegetarian, plant-based and seafood dishes. Announcing the move, chef Rasmus Kofoed said that he hadn’t eaten meat for the last five years at home, “so to no longer use meat on the new menu was a logical decision and a natural progression for Geranium”. Even the Michelin Guide, which rarely used to award stars to vegetarian and vegan restaurants, appears to be moving in a plant-based direction. Last year, Claire Vallée’s restaurant ONA (which stands for origine non-animale) in Arès, near Bordeaux, became the first vegan restaurant in France to be awarded a star. They have also introduced green stars, a new award to recognise sustainability.
Gauthier – whose plant-based menu is 50% vegan versions of classic French dishes like soufflé or foie gras and the other half is more experimental – said many chefs, particularly French chefs, fear losing Michelin stars and remain bound by the “tyranny of classical French gastronomy”. The ongoing influence of Auguste Escoffier, author of the 1903 Le Guide Culinaire and former director of kitchens at the Savoy, is, he said, a “massive problem for French gastronomy to move forward”. By contrast, Gauthier sees plant-based food as an opportunity to be truly creative. “We can write recipes that are totally out of the ordinary and nobody can come and say ‘well actually, it should not be done like that’ because it’s all new. That’s the beauty of it.”
While animals are off the menu, he said everything else remains the same. “It’s remaining 100% French, the flavours, all the tralala you think about when you go to a French restaurant.” So far, he said, the move to veganism has been “a commercial success”. As chef patron of one of the few high-end vegan restaurants in London, Gauthier hopes more chefs will follow suit. “Not a lot of chefs are brave enough to embrace a fully vegan restaurant, but a lot are looking into it and testing the water,” he said. French chef Dominique Crenn, stopped serving meat at her three Michelin-starred San Francisco restaurant Atelier Crenn in 2018. Speaking from her farm in Sonoma, where she grows produce for her three restaurants, she said it is vital that restaurants and consumers know where their products come from and do not support factory farming. But, unlike some, she is not averse to experimenting with lab-grown meat. She has partnered with Upside Foods to develop recipes for cultured chicken that, once it gets regulatory approval, she plans to serve at her restaurant. She said that when she first heard about the concept in 2015, “I thought that was genius because the bottom line is we’re not going to have the world eating just vegetables. There’s going to be people that are always going to want to eat meat or fish and all that, so I think it’s about finding ways of rebalancing this world.”
She is also looking at cutting cow’s milk from her establishments, which she hopes to do in 2022 and, when it comes to seafood, she works with small-scale fishers and mostly serves molluscs. “I’m just looking at what I can do and keep working on to become better and become more conscious.” In the UK, younger people are leading the charge when it comes to switching to a vegan diet, while the availability of documentaries such as Cowspiracy, Seaspiracy and The Game Changers on Netflix has opened up conversations around the subject. But, in many ways, UK institutions have been slow to catch up. The latest series of BBC One show MasterChef: The Professionals drew criticism after it featured just 10 vegetarian savoury dishes out of 100 and only two for vegans. Channel 4’s The Great British Bake Off also attracted ire after its first vegan contestant, Freya Cox, was required to use animal products in one of the rounds. And while recent years have seen a proliferation of lower-budget or “grab and go” vegan eating-out options, top-end establishments have proven more reluctant. Peter Harden, co-founder of Harden’s restaurant guides, said Claridge’s “missed a trick” by not taking up Humm’s plant-based menu, but that perhaps it indicates that the market is not yet big enough. “They obviously did it because they thought it would be commercial suicide. And I think that highlights the problem, especially for top chefs, is that when people are eating out and spending a lot of money then a very large proportion of them do expect to be able to eat meat.”";https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/02/out-with-the-meat-in-with-the-plants-as-worlds-top-chefs-offer-vegan-menus
5986;5986;My son’s growth this year is impressive – just don’t compare him to a porpoise | Séamas O’Reilly;2022-01-02T09:30:14Z;['Séamas O’Reilly'];['Parents and parenting', 'Family', 'Life and style'];"‘They grow up fast’ is a thing people say to parents of toddlers and we generally nod in agreement because, I mean, I guess – but do they, really? Sure, we have to buy him new clothes more frequently than we do ourselves, but it’s not exactly blink and you’ll miss it stuff. They grow up fast? Compared to what? Whales? Trees? Kids certainly grow slower than cats or dogs or cows or any other animal I can think of. I think elephants and whales take a while, but I’m not willing to look it up because I’m too busy cleaning tomato soup from every surface of the kitchen for the fifth time this week – something I’m fairly sure a three-and-a-half-year-old porpoise or badger would have grown out of by now. In the hopes of getting a sense of my son’s development over the past year, let’s take a clear-eyed survey of how much has actually changed. Speech is one of the areas of his development where time really does seem to have flown. When we watch videos of him from this time last year, helooks broadly the same, albeit a bit more squished and pudgy, but is still communicating in semi-garbled baby speech, whereas nowadays he’s one of the finest conversationalists I know. I am willing to admit that his propensity for chat is genuinely impressive, and the difference 12 months has made seems to stretch the bounds of reason. He has also gained the ability to learn any song you care to teach him, which has entered critical mass during the Christmas period. In terms of growing up fast, I’d have to give this a 9 out of 10, losing points only since he has miraculously not yet memorised any of the swear words he’s occasionally copied from us.
In terms of hygiene, he’s come on in leaps and bounds and this could be another high scoring quadrant for this year end review, – certainly when it comes to issues such as wanting to eat soil and/or drink toilet water. That being said, the ups and downs of toilet training have occasionally left us having to dispose of human waste in plastic bags while in public places. In conclusion, a mixed bag, and one occasionally filled with human waste. Arguably the most impressive change has been in coordination, since there’s no doubt the boy has progressed rapidly in this regard. He can now climb surfaces, manipulate objects and navigate his way around the wider world with an aplomb that would have seemed like science fiction 12 months ago. But, as his mobility and ambition have increased so, too, have his opportunities to enfilthen himself, and at higher places in our home. This time last year, for example, he would not have been able to open a jar of jam, nor climb into our bed. Now he can, and will, do both at the same time; allowing us to gently wake to the sensation of being stuck to our own sheets in a sugary, syrupy mess. At such moments, my wife and I rejoice in our sticky, strawberry morning, and are likely to marvel at his development anew. ‘If this is him growing up so fast,’ we say with calm delight, ‘then, frankly, it’s taking ages.’ Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

5987;5987;The BBC’s Ros Atkins: ‘I do a bit of body-boarding… posting videos is like catching a wave’;2022-01-02T09:30:14Z;['Michael Hogan'];['Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'BBC', 'Radio', 'X'];"Ros Atkins, 47, grew up in Cornwall and the Caribbean before reading history at Cambridge. His BBC career began on Radio 5 Live shortly after 9/11. He now presents Outside Source on the BBC News Channel and recently went viral for his “explainer” videos, broadcast on BBC Breakfast and posted online. He lives in south London with his wife and two daughters. How are you finding newfound fame? Well, I’ve neither been mobbed nor chased down the street, but it’s always pleasant if people pay attention to what you do. You’ve been called “the Facts Man” and “2021’s explainer-in-chief”. Happy with those descriptions? I’ve been called a lot worse, so I’ll take either of those more flattering monikers. How did you hit upon the explainer format? I’ve long been passionate about explanation as a form of news journalism. I launched Outside Source in 2014, so it’s a culmination of seven years of honing how we use language and images to explain stories as clearly as possible. I’ve definitely ended up using a different tone to a classic news bulletin. Three years ago, I noticed that the format was very successful on TV but not getting traction digitally. It wasn’t working for audiences who consume news online. I started to study different types of storytelling – how friends do it in the pub, how comedians, podcasters and documentary-makers do it. That took me to a different place in terms of how I offer up information.
It’s been called “assertive impartiality”. Is that what you were aiming for? In some ways, what we’re doing is new. In others, it’s as old as the BBC itself. The BBC’s journalism has always been rooted in facts, fairness, objectivity and providing context. These videos reimagine how we do that. Partly because of how politics has evolved, our approach to impartiality was struggling to cope. There was an appetite from audiences to be more robust in our assessments of what’s true. Let’s properly dissect what people are saying. If it’s not true, let’s say so – in no uncertain terms. You don’t bring opinion or emotion into it. It’s simply about using language that’s sparse and direct to help viewers understand. “Assertive impartiality” isn’t my phrase, but it’s not a bad description. The videos get shared by people from both ends of the political spectrum. Is that a sign that they strike the right balance? The number of views has been a lovely surprise, but I’d put that on a par with the fact that they’ve been well received across the spectrum. It’s thrilling that influential people, from a whole range of political backgrounds, think the videos are helpful.
Your video about Downing Street Christmas parties was watched 6m times on Twitter. What’s it like going viral? I’m normally sitting on the train home when the videos go live. For a news clip to get a million views on Twitter is very unusual. Six times that is extraordinary. Your messages suddenly light up. It also goes through stages. You might get an initial flurry of activity, then it’ll pause. You assume it’s run its course, but then someone like Prof Brian Cox or Gary Lineker might share it and it’ll gather momentum again. I do a bit of body-boarding and posting videos is a bit like catching a wave. Do you have trouble keeping a straight face during belief-beggaring reports? No, it’s the news and what we’re covering is serious. There may be elements within a story that people find humorous, but for me, the facts take centre-stage. I could’ve sworn I saw the hint of a smile when you said: “Drinks, nibbles, games”… Never! You have a very consistent look. How many blue shirts and jackets do you own? An awful lot. A stylist called Jane Field said navy blue suited me, so we went shopping in Oxford Street and bought loads. It means the videos all look the same – same shot, similar clothes – so people recognise them when they pop up in their feed.
You’ve broadcast from home a lot over the past two years. How’s that been? Quite convenient, actually. I set up my study as a home studio. I used three spare mattresses for soundproofing. I got a pallet from a skip down the street and put my chair on it, so it was at camera level. My younger daughter, who’s 10, operated my autocue and became very proficient. We made signs saying “No entry, live on-air”. The doorbell rang occasionally, but there’s not much you can do about that. Do your daughters find it strange that you’re on social media more than them? There’s certainly a pretty direct correlation between the popularity of these videos and my family’s frustration about how much time I’m on Twitter. They often say: “Dad, put your phone down.” I always say: “But it’s a big story” and they say: “It’s always a big story.” You were once a drum’n’bass DJ. Do you still hit the decks on occasion? No, but I might come back to it when the kids are older. My last gig was in the mid 00s at a festival in Regent’s Park. Our first daughter was born a few days later. You’re the founder of The 50:50 Project, to increase representation of women in media content. What inspired that? I started it in 2016, primarily aimed at my own programme. We all felt that gender balance in our journalism was important, but weren’t managing to achieve it. On a trip to California, I visited lots of academics, corporate people and newsroom leaders, which rearranged my brain. We started systematically generating data on everything we produce. This self-monitoring system worked, other BBC teams joined in and it snowballed. Now it’s in more than 100 organisations in 25 countries. We’re all incredibly proud of it. Most importantly, it’s delivered significant shifts in the diversity of what we make. What makes you happy when you’re not working? I love squash but got a nasty knee injury, so I’m waiting to have surgery before I can play again. I’ve got quite into running instead. I started cooking in lockdown. I used to be terrible but my wife, Sara, got me a book called Persiana by Sabrina Ghayour, which changed my entire view of the kitchen. Otherwise, I just love pottering about with football on the radio. I follow Dulwich Hamlet and Plymouth Argyle. How do you see politics panning out in 2022 and how will your explainers fit in? I’ve given up all predictions since 2016. The pandemic is obviously ongoing. So is the Brexit process. It’s hard to imagine these huge stories won’t continue to dominate the news. There’s so much information coming at all of us and people want a hand with that. Someone said that watching my videos is like having 10 podcasts and five long reads crammed into your head within a few minutes. They’re a shortcut. There was a groundswell of opinion last year that you should do an explainer for Line of Duty too… I saw that. There are limits to what the team can do. Perhaps the Line of Duty finale is beyond us.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/02/ros-atkins-bbc-explainer-videos-viral-interview
5988;5988;It’s not the police’s job to shut down political debate. They should stick to solving crime | Sonia Sodha;2022-01-02T09:30:13Z;['Sonia Sodha'];['Women', 'Transgender', 'Society', 'Men', 'Law'];"A man gets a call from a police officer. He is told that, while he has done nothing criminal, his social media posts have offended someone, so the police have recorded them as a non-crime hate incident that may show up on criminal record checks. The officer warns that if he continues to “escalate” matters, the police may take criminal action against him, a message later reinforced by his superiors. It may sound like something out of a police state. But this happened in Britain in 2019, in a case that led the high court judge who later ruled the actions of Humberside police force unlawful to warn them, “in this country we have never had a Cheka, a Gestapo or a Stasi”. Despite there being no evidence that Harry Miller, the man in question, might ever stray into unlawful speech, the police took action that reasonably led him to believe that he was being warned not to exercise his right to freedom of expression on pain of potential criminal prosecution; they also opined to the press that Miller’s tweets were “transphobic”. And just before Christmas, in a landmark judgment that has attracted surprisingly little commentary from human rights lawyers given its profound implications, the court of appeal went further in ruling that the College of Policing’s guidance that the police should record all non-crime hate incidents, as perceived by those taking offence at them, is an unlawful incursion on citizens’ freedom of expression. How did we get to the position where an individual had to risk financial ruin to legally defend his right to free expression in the face of unlawful police actions? The well-intentioned roots of police recording non-crime hate incidents stem from the 1999 Macpherson report into Stephen Lawrence’s murder in 1993, which found institutional racism in the Metropolitan police. Macpherson recommended that the police adopt the definition of a racist incident as any “perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person” and that non-crime incidents should be reported, recorded and investigated with equal commitment to crimes. The aim was to help the police overcome their institutional racism and to build confidence within ethnic minority communities. This has today evolved into a system of recording non-crime hate incidents that cover five of the nine protected characteristics in the Equality Act, including transgender identity (but not, bizarrely, sex). In a world where the police do not have the resources to investigate non-crime incidents, partly because of the volume of reports generated by social media, the College of Policing tells police officers to record as hate incidents all those perceived by the person reporting them as motivated by hostility, including unfriendliness or dislike. This has become open to manipulation, with sinister consequences for freedom of expression. Anyone can complain to the police if they don’t like something someone says. It will get recorded as a hate incident, in a way that could significantly damage careers and reputations but with none of the due process of a criminal charge. And it is impossible to overstate the chilling impact of getting a call from a police officer warning you off exercising your democratic rights.
Miller is chair of the Reclaim party, led by Laurence Fox; hardly a political ally of this newspaper. The judge noted his tweets were “for the most part, either opaque, profane or unsophisticated”. But that does not justify impeding his right to contribute to a live and contentious political debate on the relative importance of biological sex and self-declared gender identity in determining how society constitutes things such as single-sex spaces and sports. It is a far from settled matter with legitimate competing perspectives. Yet people (often women) of the “gender critical” view – that biological sex cannot be wholly replaced by gender identity in law and society – have been vulnerable to incursions on their free expression, because opponents have sought to misrepresent their position as so hateful that it is beyond the limits of legitimate discussion. (The absurdity of this mischaracterisation is shown up in the confirmation by the courts last year that the scientific understanding that biological sex is immutable is a protected belief under equalities law.) There are several other cases where the police have acted inappropriately against people lawfully expressing this position. Some forces even have a track record of misstating the law to the public: last February, Merseyside police wrongly claimed “being offensive is an offence”, while the West Yorkshire police in 2018 threatened to prosecute anyone posting “insulting” messages on its Facebook page. The police need to be politically impartial – they must not police people differently because of their political opinions. Yet there are numerous examples of police forces actively taking political sides in the sex and gender debate. Paul Giannasi, the national policing adviser for hate crime, has praised Lancashire police for expressing disappointment at lawful expressions of gender critical belief, congratulating them for their “initiative and empathy” in doing so. Several police forces pay the LGBT charity Stonewall for advice and training, despite Stonewall’s promotion of a contested political stance on gender identity. The police officer who unlawfully warned off Miller told him, Miller said, that a foetus could have a female brain but grow male body parts, later confirming he learned this unscientific belief on a training course. Greater Manchester police social media accounts have used and defended the derogatory and misogynistic term “terf”, associated with rape and death threats against women expressing gender-critical beliefs. Several dreadful murder cases from the last year have served as a reminder that many police forces remain tarnished by institutional misogyny, racism and homophobia. But there are no shortcuts to the cultural change essential for the non-discriminatory policing all citizens have the right to expect. Telling the police to record all non-criminal hate incidents or to believe all victims despite their role as investigators are inappropriately blunt approaches that undermine fair and impartial policing. The court of appeal judgment’s implications for free expression go way beyond policing: it observes “how quickly some involved in the transgender debate are prepared to accuse others with whom they disagree of showing hatred, or as being transphobic when they are not”. We see this everywhere: from Harry Potter actors condemning JK Rowling for her “hateful” views, to broadcasters saying interviewees should be “cancelled” for saying biological sex is immutable, to academics such as Kathleen Stock abused for wrongthink. There is no democracy without freedom of expression. That the police have unlawfully acted to shut down legitimate political debate in 21st-century Britain should remind us that, even in mature democracies, the most basic human rights should never be taken for granted. • This article was amended on 4 January 2022.

5989;5989;Bulls’ DeMar DeRozan makes history with second buzzer-beater in 24 hours;2022-01-02T09:25:24Z;['N/A'];['NBA', 'Chicago Bulls', 'Washington Wizards', 'Basketball', 'Sport', 'US sports'];"DeMar DeRozan hit a three-pointer at the buzzer for the second straight game to give the Chicago Bulls a 120-119 win over the Washington Wizards on Saturday night. Kyle Kuzma’s three-pointer with 3.3 seconds to play gave Washington a 119-117 lead, until DeRozan beat the Wizards in the same way he beat Indiana on Friday night.
DeRozan finished with 28 points and Zach LaVine had 35 points to help the Bulls to their seventh straight win, which is their longest streak since 18-29 December 2014. According to BasketballReference.com, DeRozan became the first player in NBA history to hit buzzer-beaters on consecutive days. “It’s amazing, especially doing it on the road,” DeRozan said. “I don’t know if I’m dreaming or if it’s real right now. “You work your butt off and you understand that if you’re in those positions, try to capitalize on them the best way you can because you’re going to have games where you miss some.”
The Wizards led nearly the whole game, outscoring Chicago 72-30 in points in the paint. “He just made a heck of a play. He was defended pretty well,” Washington coach Wes Unseld Jr said. “It’s just tough. It’s tough to lose a game like that.” Kuzma scored 29 points and had 12 rebounds, while Bradley Beal had 27 points and a career-high 16 assists in his first start at point guard. Beal also passed the 14,000 point mark. Midway through the second quarter, the Wizards were called for a technical full for too many players. Alize Johnson, one of five players on 10-day contracts, was the sixth player on the court. DeRozan said he concentrated on the fundamentals before he shot the game-winner. “I wanted to make sure my feet were behind the line,” he said. “I wanted to give it a chance to go in. “My shots all night were short. It’s tough to play on back-to-backs. I kind of felt it throughout the game.” LaVine shook his head when asked to describe DeRozan. “The dude’s incredible,” LaVine said. “You can’t say much more than that…Thank God we’ve got DeMar DeRozan on our team.” Throughout Beal’s NBA career, he has marveled at DeRozan. “That’s what he does,” Beal said. “He takes tough shots and he makes tough shots.” Beal believes the short-handed Wizards simply came up short against a marvelous opponent. “We did everything we possibly could to win, but DeRo just made a crazy shot at the end of the game,” he said. “In a way, the shot is demoralizing and takes the energy out of you, but to know that we competed and played hard, we set ourselves up to win, and you feel great about that.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/demar-derozan-buzzer-beater-chicago-bulls
5990;5990;Notes on chocolate: a selection to sharpen your tastebuds;2022-01-02T09:00:14Z;['Annalisa Barbieri'];['Chocolate', 'Food', 'Life and style'];Welcome to 2022. This week I bring you a collection to really sharpen your tastebuds and a bar to snuggle up and eat whilst reading a good book. Here, can I recommend Lady in Waiting by Anne Glenconner, which I find deeply comforting before bed as it talks about nothing whatsoever to do with my world. Firetree, which regular readers will know makes the only 100% I rate, has launched a new Innovations Collection, either available as single bars, £7/65g each, or as a five-bar gift box, £33. Firetree chocolate always makes me think about the cocoa bean because there isn’t very much else to distract you, although this time the already highly flavoured Vanuatu cocoa from Malekula Island has cocoa nibs in it and marks Firetree’s first inclusion bar. There are three 72% versions of different origins, a 100% bar and also an oat milk version. This is ideal if really good, simple and largely dark chocolate is your thing. I’ve mentioned in passing Solkiki’s Elvis bar, £8.50, so named because it’s based on Elvis Presley’s love of banana and peanut butter sandwiches, but I want to, here, stress how terrifically good it is. I’m not a fan of banana-flavoured things, but this and Ottolenghi’s banana jam – which you get when you go to his cafés if you order toasted things and is so so good – convinced me otherwise. The bar contains vegan milk chocolate, roasted peanuts and chunks of banana. The kind of craziness we all need to see in a new year.

5991;5991;Covid clinics: hope and high prices on the long road to recovery;2022-01-02T09:00:14Z;['Amelia Tait'];['Long Covid', 'Spa breaks', 'Coronavirus', 'Health', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Health and fitness holidays', 'Healthcare industry'];"Underneath the shadow of the snow-topped Austrian Alps, in front of a forest of thick green trees and behind a pure azure lake, sits a sprawling chalet that has seen everyone from Kate Moss to Michael Gove pass through its wide glass doors. The VivaMayr health resort in Altaussee, Austria, has long been the picturesque home of celebrity detoxes – strict bans on caffeine and alcohol, combined with stricter rules about the number of times you need to chew your food (40, naturally) have helped numerous celebrity clientele lose weight. The detoxing might sound harsh, but tranquillity oozes through the resort’s Instagram page, where enchanting mists tickle thick evergreen trees and women pose with mugs in sleek, pine interiors. It’s not the image that comes to mind when you think “long-Covid clinic”, but it is one. For £2,700 a week (excluding accommodation), sufferers can attend VivaMayr’s post-Covid medical programme, which promises a “better quality of life”. There is currently no cure for long Covid – the condition in which individuals continue to suffer Covid-19 symptoms for months after first being infected – but there are plenty of treatments. There is an entire network of specialist NHS long-Covid clinics across the United Kingdom – here, patients can undergo rehabilitative programmes to help them improve their stamina, breathing and cognitive functions (for many, long Covid is characterised by fatigue, breathlessness, and concentration problems). Yet in September, the Office for National Statistics estimated that 1.1 million people in the UK currently suffer with long Covid, while between July and August, only 5,737 people were referred to specialist NHS clinics. With the Omicron variant threatening more lives, there’s a gap in the market for long-Covid care, and plenty of private practitioners are happy to fill it – for a price. Gwyneth Paltrow was one of the first. In February 2021, the actor and businesswoman wrote a blogpost on her lifestyle website, Goop, detailing her post-Covid regime, which included fasting and “doing an infrared sauna as often as I can”. Paltrow’s post helpfully listed the numerous products she’d used to get a handle on her “long-tail fatigue and brain fog”: £112 Goopbrand vitamin C serum, a nearly-£400 sauna blanket, and a single £105 drinking glass (purchasable from the Goop site) via which long-Covid sufferers can sip non-alcoholic gin (also helpfully linked). The National Medical Director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, warned against Paltrow’s advice, saying, “Some of the solutions she’s recommending are really not the solutions we’d recommend in the NHS. We need to take long Covid seriously and apply serious science.” But Paltrow is far from the only person who can be accused of commercialising and commodifying long-Covid treatments. Over the course of the past year, numerous long-Covid wellness retreats have sprung up across the globe, offering treatments for breath-taking prices. In ascending order of eye watering, there’s: the Park Igls Fit After Covid “therapeutic module” in Austria for £3,000 a week; the RAKxa long Covid programme in Thailand at £2,893 for three nights; and the Arrigo Long Covid Healing Programme in Somerset, £2,500 a day (minimum seven-day stay). Then there’s VivaMayr, where patients can exercise in the Alpine air, jump into the icy lake and have frequent massages to help them relieve their symptoms.
All four of the above programmes involve qualified medical professionals, diagnostic tests and tailored diets alongside wellness practices, such as yoga, mud baths, “aquagymnastics” and acupuncture. Although there are some unorthodox treatments on offer – Park Igls promises patients “three liver compresses with beeswax”, while RAKxa patients undergo Ya-Pao therapy, in which a paste is applied to their chest and set on fire – these complement traditional medicine. Brendan Delaney is a professor of medicine at Imperial College London who, alongside 30 other doctors, spent six months putting together a set of recommendations for recognising and managing long Covid; it was published in the British Journal of General Practice in November. Delaney personally isn’t too concerned about the types of treatments on offer to patients at long-Covid retreats. “They’re getting the medical input and then they’re getting the rehab type input via some form of wellness activity,” Delaney says. “If they happen to be able to afford to have that in a trip to the Austrian Alps, well that’s a wonderful place to have your rehab.” The problem, of course, is that the vast majority of long-Covid sufferers can’t afford it. “The idea that long Covid patients are the Knightsbridge worried-well that can ship off and do these kind of wellness things is completely erroneous. The biggest groups [of sufferers] are healthcare workers and teachers, followed by care home staff, because they’ve had the biggest exposure to Covid early on, and possibly quite large viral loads,” says Delaney, who himself has had long Covid for almost two years. Although most sufferers can’t afford bespoke multi-thousand pound retreats, Delaney says that many do seek private help, be it “packages of online wellness treatment for a few hundred pounds” or hyperbaric oxygen therapy, a treatment where patients breathe pure oxygen at high pressures to help oxygenate their tissues and promote healing. “If you’re in a situation where you are unable to work, you feel awful, and you can’t carry out your family and your social obligations, then you’re going to try and find any way you can to try and improve the situation you’re in,” Delaney says, noting that it’s “not unusual” for NHS long-Covid clinics to have up to “10-month” waiting lists. According to the most recent NHS England data, more than a third of people referred to post-Covid assessment centres in England have to wait “15+ weeks” to be seen, while in the southwest of England specifically, 49% of patients have to wait this long. In this environment, increasingly desperate patients are willing to spend a fortune on private tests and treatments, as well as vitamins, supplements, IV drips, herbs and alternative medicines that they hope will provide relief. The issue is exacerbated because many patients can’t even get referred to NHS long-Covid clinics in the first place – often their symptoms are dismissed as anxiety. “The problem that a lot of patients have is not being taken seriously,” Delaney says, “Because the largest group of patients are women… and there’s a long history in medicine of not taking women’s problems seriously.” (A March 2021 paper in the BMJ found that middle-aged women in particular face a “greater risk of debilitating long-term symptoms” after hospital treatment for Covid-19.) Delaney works one day a week as a GP and has seen this problem first hand. One of his patients was referred to an NHS long-Covid clinic and dismissed as anxious. Delaney brought the patient in and did his own tests, and found that she had tachycardia (a heart rate that was too fast). Delaney was able to prescribe medicine to the woman thanks to his long-Covid expertise, but he knows that many health workers would simply have dismissed her. Patients who can afford elaborate wellness retreats, then, aren’t just getting treatment for their money – they’re also getting access to someone who takes them seriously. A wealth divide exists in long-Covid treatment, which is exacerbated by the fact that being sick in itself is already expensive, with many left unable to work. In the autumn, a small survey of 252 sufferers conducted by campaign group Long Covid Support found that 45% had been unable to return to work, while 5% had been directly dismissed by their employers because of their condition. “People with conditions such as chronic fatigue and possibly long-Covid experience substantial disruption to their lives and support from family and friends is often required,” says Paul McCrone, a professor of health economics at the University of Greenwich who has authored papers on the hidden costs of chronic fatigue. While McCrone says there will always be a demand for private medicine, he adds that one-size-fits-all treatments have historically left many chronic fatigue sufferers seeking paid-for alternatives outside of the NHS. “Effective individualised treatments are needed and this does require large amounts of funding,” McCrone says. “It is essentially a political choice as to how much we spend on healthcare. The line frequently given is that resources are scarce, but that is a relative concept – how scarce are they? We currently spend less than 10% of GDP on health and so there is scope for increases.” In July, the National Institute for Health Research set aside £19.6m for 15 studies on diagnosing and treating long Covid. Yet while there continues to be no consensus on the best treatments, let alone a cure, retreats will continue to attract customers. Although most of the treatments on offer here are unlikely to be damaging, it is entirely possible that someone could spend £10,000 hoping to be cured and come out the other end feeling no better. Writing in the Telegraph in October, journalist and long-Covid sufferer Helen Kirwan-Taylor argued that, “Cynicism goes out of the window when you’re desperate.” She described feeling “radiant” after one retreat, but overdoing it the next day and being “drained” by the time night fell. “Residential clinics speed up the healing process, but unless you maintain the benefits with the right diet and regular treatments at home, the symptoms come flooding back,” she concluded. Dr Peter Gartner is the head physician at the Park Igls retreat in Austria. He says its Fit After Covid programme was developed in autumn 2020, by adding “a few treatments and a few diagnostic tools” to the resort’s standard Mayr medicine package, which emphasises the gut’s role in wellbeing. Gartner says Park Igls patients undergo a “chewing bootcamp” where they learn to chew thoroughly and are also treated with detoxes, including the beeswax compress. He adds that Park Iglis’s experts kept up to date with long-Covid research in order to offer the best diagnostic tools as part of the new package, including a spirometry test to measure lung function. He says the retreat sees “a few” long-Covid patients per week. “There are no side-effects and this is a programme everybody can do,” Gartner says when asked if he’s concerned that because so little is known about long Covid, the treatments on offer could potentially make people feel worse. Gartner says sufferers with “severe problems” should undergo intensive rehab with 24-hour monitoring and see specialists and virologists – he says these specialist medical houses are common in Austria. “Our offer is just: what can we do afterwards?” Gartner says, “It’s just a missing link between the rehabs and normal life.” Fiona Arrigo, founder of wellness retreat company the Arrigo Programme, says her Somerset-based long-Covid retreat was “created in response to the strong demand of those struggling with the insidious after-effects of Covid-19” – she says staff receive “daily enquiries” from potential patients. Arrigo says the programme gives sufferers time to process the “shock, trauma, exhaustion, depletion” of long Covid and the bespoke treatment plan helps people recuperate. This, she says, is also why the retreat is expensive: “It is this price because of the exceptionally high level of expertise, the access our clients get to the different specialists and the in-depth testing it requires and also because the programme is completely bespoke to the individual.” Kirwan-Taylor described staying at a “charming cottage” filled with “mounds of fresh strawberries” and “personalised bathrooms”, with her own little river outside. “On the first night I had acupuncture on a heated bed covered in flower petals, then a bath with magnesium flakes.” Arrigo says the retreat’s long-Covid patients have built confidence, developed deeper breathing patterns, improved their energy levels, and found “deeper understanding and self-compassion on this often challenging and difficult journey.” Still, results aren’t guaranteed and she says staff “talk very clearly to everyone” to “ensure clients coming know what we can realistically offer and what they need.” If Arrigo staff feel they can’t help, they recommend other possible clinics that clients can attend. According to management consulting firm McKinsey, the global wellness market is now worth $1.5tn and it’s constantly growing. Yet while mindfulness and meditation has been shown to help with the stress and anxiety of long Covid, wellness solutions should not replace properly funded medical care. “There is a neoliberal ideology that expects us to take full individual responsibility for our health and well-being – allowing governments to withdraw and defund public services,” says Ronald Purser, a professor of management at San Francisco State University and author of McMindfulness: How Mindfulness Became the New Capitalist Spirituality. “Like any other hot commodity, mindfulness has been refashioned to accommodate the needs of the market, obfuscating critical reflection on the systemic causes of our collective malaise and institutional stress.” Purser argues: “Fundamental health inequities must be addressed at a government policy level.” Most of those able to afford luxury long-Covid retreats will see some benefit – rest, relaxation and tailored treatment plans can never be a bad thing. “But none of these things are getting to the root cause of the problem, which is still what we’re trying to find out,” GP Delaney notes, “Is it blood vessel inflammation? Is it an immune problem? Is it a persistent virus? Is it blood clots?” Each new variant, including Omicron, behaves slightly differently and brings new questions. If nothing else, long Covid is the great equaliser – even the richest among us can’t pay their way to the answers.";https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/jan/02/covid-clinics-hope-and-high-prices-on-the-long-road-to-recovery
5992;5992;If you’ve resolved to improve your finances for the new year …;2022-01-02T09:00:14Z;['Shane Hickey'];['Money', 'Consumer affairs', 'Pensions', 'Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars', 'Energy bills', 'Students', 'Student finance', 'Education', 'Ethical and green living', 'Household bills', 'Higher education', 'Motoring'];It’s a new year and many of us are looking for a fresh start after a very difficult 2021. We’ve asked a group of experts for their advice on how to tackle some of the most common personal finance dilemmas. I want to spend less money this year, what should I do? Damien Fahy, founder of personal finance site Money to the Masses The key to spending less is having a budget – if you can quantify it, you can control it. Luckily, there are lots of resources to help work out a monthly budget, including budgeting and banking apps. I’d recommend Money Dashboard and Emma. Try using the “three-day rule” to curb frivolous spending – if you want something, wait three days before buying it to see if you genuinely want or need it, rather than it being a momentary impulse. You can also introduce zero-spend days into your week, aiming to have 24 hours without additional spending, over and above essentials, such as food and bills. How can I clear my overdraft? Sara Williams, founder of the Debt Camel advice blog Overdrafts are a hard type of debt to clear, as your balance keeps changing through the month. But they are also very expensive, so are a priority to tackle. You can be very disciplined, and aim to cut your overdraft usage each month. Many people find it is more practical to change to a new current account with no overdraft and move all of their banking over. That way you can pay off the old overdraft by setting up a standing order from your new account. If you have been continuously in your overdraft for a long while, never getting back into the black, you should also look at making a claim for unaffordable lending. This would be based on whether the bank “completed reasonable and proportionate checks” that you could repay in a sustainable way. Details at the Financial Ombudsman Service website. I need a decent pension. How do I begin? Steve Webb, partner at LCP and former pensions minister If you earn more than £10,000, your employer should put you in a workplace pension and make a contribution, so simply not opting out is a great start. Next, review your pension contribution each time you get a pay increase, as it’s less painful to commit a bit more before you’ve got used to the extra income. Also, find out if your employer will do more, if you do more. Many bigger firms will match the money you put in (up to a limit). Make the most of this “free money”. Finally, it’s never too late to start. You get good tax breaks for saving in a pension, plus money from your employer, so even building up a small pot is worthwhile. How can I drive an electric car without breaking the bank? Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of Zap-Map, which gives information on charging and electric vehicles One of the best routes to getting a good value electric vehicle (EV) is via a salary sacrifice scheme. Another flexible option is to subscribe to a short-term, all-inclusive service such as Onto, which includes insurance, charging and tax, among other expenses. There are also more secondhand EVs available to buy – try out one of the specialist companies, such as Weareev or Drive Green. Once you have secured your electric vehicle, your next step is to get a charge point installed at your home and sign up to an EV energy tariff with discounts for off-peak charging when available, given current energy tariff issues. With this, costs can be as low as 2-3p/mile – even less if you can link it to solar panels. Alternatively, you can check out community charging via Co-Charger, or take a look at the close to 30,000 public charge points on Zap-Map, about 5,000 of which are still free to use. Energy bills are killing me, how do I save money? Laura McGadie, group head of energy, Energy Saving Trust There are a series of simple and straightforward things you can do that will save you money without compromising your health or lifestyle. Firstly, turn off devices that are on standby and turn off lights when you leave the room. Be sure to draught-proof around windows, doors, floorboards and skirting boards and insulate hot water cylinders with an 80mm British Standard jacket. In the kitchen, fit an aerator to the tap – it reduces the amount of water flowing – and only boil water you need in the kettle. Reduce the number of washing machine loads you run by one a week, and ensure they are always full. Wash clothes at 30 degrees. Avoid using a tumble dryer – dry clothes outside where possible, or inside with ventilation. Limit shower times to four minutes and swap a weekly bath for a shower. Take all of these steps and you could save up to £248 a year. How can I prepare for my child starting university this year? Laura Brown, editor, Save the Student It’s worth familiarising yourself with the student finance system and, if possible, saving up some money to help them get by. Research has found that, on average, students receive £120.56 a month from parents. But one in eight feels their parents don’t give enough financial support. As maintenance loans are generally calculated on household income, you might find the government actually expects you to contribute, offering a smaller loan as a result. We have a parental contributions calculator that helps you work out how much this could be. Saving to financially support your child, as well as sharing your best money-management tips, could make a huge difference. I want to eat more sustainably – what should I do? Sian Conway-Wood, author of Buy Better, Consume Less The first thing is to not do something – and that is waste food. Households account for 70% of food waste in the UK, and the majority of food thrown away would have been edible. The cost of that adds up to £284 a person each year. Plan ahead, buy what you need and take steps to avoid waste. All of these steps are the first moves towards sustainable eating and can save you money as a result. Potatoes, bread and fresh fruit and vegetables are some of the most wasted foods. We’re often encouraged to buy in bulk, but they can be purchased in smaller quantities. Pay attention to how much you actually use and reduce the amount you buy. I am scared of being scammed. What steps should I take to protect myself? Jason Costain, head of fraud prevention at NatWest When buying goods, only use sellers or shops that accept card payments. Be suspicious when answering calls, texts and emails. There will always be the latest ingenious scam, so any time you give someone your address, email, or date of birth, stop and think. Do I trust them and what do they need it for? A lot of victims are the target of sophisticated scammers days after they’ve innocently given away basic information. I want a pay rise, how do I go about it? Charles Cotton, senior policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development Do your homework by checking what the going rate is for similar jobs, such as through a salary comparison website like Glassdoor. If you’re already being paid the average salary, or higher, it could prove harder to justify an increase, so you may want to go for a promotion, instead. If you’re not, make sure you make this point when putting forward your case. Strengthen it further by giving examples of why you deserve a pay rise – perhaps you met all your annual objectives, or you’ve excelled on a particular project. While it makes sense to talk to your manager first, they will most likely not be able to authorise a pay rise. Make their job easier by writing down your reasons, which they can share with their colleagues.;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/02/if-youve-resolved-to-improve-your-finances-for-the-new-year-
5993;5993;Oppositions by Mary Gaitskill review – wide-ranging, unsparing essays ;2022-01-02T09:00:14Z;['Abhrajyoti Chakraborty'];['Essays', 'Books', 'Mary Gaitskill', 'Culture'];"In one of Mary Gaitskill’s best short stories, The Agonized Face, a female journalist watches a “feminist author” read at a literary festival. The author begins by complaining about her biographical note in the festival brochure, which, she feels, has played up her past experiences with prostitution and psychiatric wards to make her seem like “a kooky person off somewhere doing unimaginable stuff”. But just after she has persuaded the audience of the unfairness of such a portrayal, the author reads a funny story aloud from her book, which leaves the journalist unimpressed. The story – about an encounter between a man and an older woman – is flimsy and provocative, where the complaint had been tender and serious. “She sprouted three heads,” the journalist writes, “and asked that we accept them all!” The feminist had evaded something important, according to the journalist, by changing gears so abruptly: “the story she read made what had seemed like dignity look silly and obscene.” Gaitskill’s characters are often unjustly perceived as kooky people doing unimaginable stuff, but her stories are neither silly nor obscene. In Secretary – later made into a treacly film starring Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader – you can never quite tell how Debby feels about being abused and spanked by her male boss. Unlike in the movie, there is no blossoming relationship between boss and secretary, but might Debby be looking for dignity in the routine humiliation? In Oppositions, a new collection of Gaitskill’s essays, she asserts that the tragedy of the story is not so much that Debby is a victim, but that a “hunger for contact underlies her perversity and to some extent drives it”. It is a wordless yearning that contemporary feminist discourse now and again skips over in its quest to invert the male gaze and normalise female desire. And yet, as the journalist in The Agonized Face suggests, “sometimes you wish it could be that easy”.
Gaitskill skips over nothing on the page. Her sentences are leavened by a novelist’s spirited discontent with mere facts, a distrust of transparent surfaces. Recounting an incident when she was sexually assaulted at 16, she wonders why she had described it for a while as “rape”. She’d lied “not for revenge but in service of… the metaphorical truth – although what that truth was is not at all clear to me”. In a piece on Lolita, where she is withering about the “haters” who conflate art and life, Gaitskill is moved by Nabokov’s bizarre claim that he was inspired by a newspaper article about a chimpanzee in a zoo that drew with charcoal the bars of its cage. “For those of us for whom metaphors are a natural way of seeing,” Gaitskill writes, “it makes instant, terrible sense.” The remaining essays – on music, films, the Bible, American sex scandals – together make up a shadow autobiography. We learn, from a piece on the Book of Revelation, that Gaitskill ran away from home in her teens, and that at 21 she was briefly a born-again Christian. A trip to Russia becomes an occasion to recall the time she worked at a strip joint in Canada.
Listening to Talking Heads, she realises how their music was always playing somewhere in the background, and in her head, when she was starting to write in her 20s. A song by B-Movie conjures up memories of a thwarted romance from the 80s. About music, Gaitskill declares at one point that “she is not a fan by nature”, but her longueurs on bands and songs have a certain underhand charm. Fans of her fiction will relish the impossibly cool image of a younger Gaitskill typing out her early stories with the headphones on every morning. With Gaitskill, you scarcely get or sometimes even expect popular opinions, regardless of whether she is riffing on Chekhov or the Clintons. She is seldom persuaded by groupthink, be it the “psychological uniformity of experience” that she decries in both “rape-crisis” American feminists and their critics in the mid-90s, or years later, the “hive-mind” that she feels is at work in the bestselling novel Gone Girl: “There is nothing here but ‘that guy’ or ‘that girl’, and that means nothing, period.” She defends John Updike’s right to be narcissistic, Norman Mailer’s impulse to be a “kook”.

5994;5994;Nasa’s Webb telescope is a joy. But it’s the private ventures that push at limits | Martin Rees;2022-01-02T09:00:13Z;['Martin Rees'];['James Webb space telescope', 'Space', 'Astronomy', 'Science', 'The space shuttle', 'SpaceX', 'Blue Origin', 'Hubble space telescope'];"After years of delay, and massive cost over-runs, the James Webb space telescope (the JWST) was launched on Christmas Day. It will need to perform complex automated operations now it’s in space. The first and most challenging is happening this week: unfurling a heat shield the size of a tennis court. After this, its 6.5-metre mirror must be assembled from 18 pieces packed within the launching rocket’s nose-cone. There’s much that can go wrong and astronomers will remain anxious for the several months that will elapse before all necessary manoevres and tests are completed. After the Hubble Space Telescope was launched more than 30 years ago, its mirror turned out to be poorly aligned. But astronauts undertook a “rescue” mission to make adjustments and later made further visits to upgrade the instruments. The stakes are higher for the JWST: it’s vastly more elaborate, but there is no prospect of a repair mission. The Hubble telescope was in a low (and accessible) orbit: in contrast, the JWST’s orbit will be several times further away than the moon – far beyond the reach of astronauts. Some might argue that we therefore need to instigate more ambitious plans for human spaceflight: to enable human assembly of large structures in deep space, to return to the moon, and eventually to reach Mars. But I don’t share this view. Indeed as robotics and miniaturisation improve, the practical and scientific case for human spaceflight weakens. Its prime motive now is simply as an adventure – an ultra-expensive sport that should be left to billionaires and private sponsorship. Space technology has burgeoned – for communication, environmental monitoring, satnav and so forth. We depend on it every day. Unmanned probes to other planets have beamed back pictures of varied and distinctive worlds. And telescopes in space have revolutionised our knowledge of the cosmos. During this century, the whole solar system will be explored by flotillas of miniaturised probes, far more advanced than, for instance, Nasa’s wonderful Cassini probe, which spent 13 years exploring Saturn and its moons. This was launched 20 years ago and based on 1990s technology. Think how much better we could do today. Robotic fabricators will assemble vast lightweight structures in space (huge, gossamer-thin mirrors or solar energy collectors, for instance), maybe using raw materials mined from the moon or asteroids. And they could repair spacecraft in orbit far beyond the moon. Robotic and AI techniques are evolving fast. For instance, the Curiosity vehicle sent to Mars a decade ago trundled slowly across a Martian crater; if it encountered a rock, it needed instructions from Earth about how to divert its path. In contrast, Perseverance, which landed on Mars last February, has sufficient intelligence to find its way around obstacles. In another decade, such a probe will have AI sufficient to identify and explore interesting sites and geological formations. Nasa’s programme for human spaceflight, ever since Apollo, has been impeded by public and political pressure into being exceedingly risk-averse. The space shuttle failed twice in 135 launches. Thrill-seekers would willingly accept this 2% level of risk. But the shuttle had, unwisely, been promoted as “safe”. So each failure caused a national trauma and was followed by a hiatus while costly efforts were made (with very limited effect) to reduce the risk. Because of this safety culture, Nasa will confront political obstacles in achieving any grand goal within a feasible budget.
But private enterprise ventures – SpaceX, Blue Origin and the rest – bringing a Silicon Valley culture into a domain long dominated by Nasa and a few aerospace conglomerates, can cut costs and tolerate higher risks than a western government could impose on publicly funded civilian astronauts. So it’s these ventures, with private funds and sponsorship, which should front manned missions. The phrase “space tourism” should be avoided. It lulls people into believing such ventures are routine and low risk. And if that’s the perception, the inevitable accidents will be as traumatic as those of the space shuttle. These exploits must be sold as dangerous sports or intrepid exploration. Don’t ever expect mass emigration from Earth. And here I disagree strongly with Elon Musk and with my late colleague Stephen Hawking. It’s a dangerous delusion to think that space offers an escape from its problems. We’ve got to solve them here. Coping with climate change is a doddle compared to terraforming Mars. Nowhere in our solar system offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Everest. There’s no “Planet B” for ordinary, risk-averse people. Nonetheless, this century courageous thrill-seekers may establish bases independent from the Earth. Musk himself says he wants to die on Mars – but not on impact. Although we may not want to join these space adventurers we should cheer them on. This is why. They’ll be ill-adapted to Martian conditions, so they’ll have a compelling incentive to redesign themselves. They’ll harness the super-powerful genetic and cyborg technologies that will be developed. These techniques will, one hopes, be restrained on Earth, on prudential and ethical grounds, but settlers on Mars will be beyond the clutches of the regulators. We should wish them good luck in modifying their progeny to adapt to alien environments. This might be the first step towards divergence into a new species. So it’s these spacefaring adventurers, not those of us comfortably adapted to life on Earth, who will spearhead the post-human era, evolving within a few centuries into a new species. (This evolution, proceeding on the timescale of technological advance, is potentially thousands of times faster than Darwinian selection.) Moreover, if they make the transition from flesh and blood to fully inorganic intelligences, they won’t need an atmosphere. And they may prefer zero-g, especially for constructing massive artifacts. So it’s in deep space – not on Earth, nor even on Mars – that non-biological “brains” may develop powers that humans can’t even imagine. The sun will survive 6bn more years before its fuel runs out. And the expanding universe will continue far longer, perhaps for ever. So even if intelligent life had originated only on the Earth, it need not remain a trivial feature of the cosmos: it could jump-start a diaspora whereby ever more complex intelligence spreads through the whole galaxy, via self-reproducing machines, transmitting DNA, instructions for 3D printers or suchlike. Interstellar voyages would hold no terrors for near-immortals. There’s plenty of time ahead.

5995;5995;Britain got it wrong on Covid: long lockdown did more harm than good, says scientist;2022-01-02T09:00:13Z;['Robin McKie'];['Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Epidemics', 'Science and nature books', 'UK news', 'Science', 'Books', 'Medical research', 'World news', 'Politics'];"There was a distinctive moment, at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, that neatly encapsulated the mistakes and confusion of Britain’s early efforts to tackle the disease, says Mark Woolhouse. At a No 10 briefing in March 2020, cabinet minister Michael Gove warned the virus did not discriminate. “Everyone is at risk,” he announced. And nothing could be further from the truth, argues Professor Woolhouse, an expert on infectious diseases at Edinburgh University. “I am afraid Gove’s statement was simply not true,” he says. “In fact, this is a very discriminatory virus. Some people are much more at risk from it than others. People over 75 are an astonishing 10,000 times more at risk than those who are under 15.” And it was this failure to understand the wide variations in individual responses to Covid-19 that led to Britain’s flawed responses to the disease’s appearance, he argues – errors that included the imposition of a long-lasting, national lockdown. This is a strategy that Woolhouse – one of the country’s leading epidemiologists – describes as morally wrong and highly damaging in his forthcoming book, The Year the World Went Mad: A Scientific Memoir. “We did serious harm to our children and young adults who were robbed of their education, jobs and normal existence, as well as suffering damage to their future prospects, while they were left to inherit a record-breaking mountain of public debt,” he argues. “All this to protect the NHS from a disease that is a far, far greater threat to the elderly, frail and infirm than to the young and healthy. “We were mesmerised by the once-in-a-century scale of the emergency and succeeded only in making a crisis even worse. In short, we panicked. This was an epidemic crying out for a precision public health approach and it got the opposite.”
Rather than imposing blanket lockdowns across the nation, the government should have adopted measures designed to make contacts safe, Woolhouse maintains. “You can see from the UK data that people were reducing their contacts with each other as cases rose and before lockdown was imposed. That, coupled with Covid-safe measures, such as masks and testing, would have been sufficient to control spread.” Largely voluntary behaviour change worked in Sweden and it should have been allowed to progress in the UK, argues Woolhouse. Instead, we plumped for an enforced national lockdown, in part because, for the first time in history, we could. Enough business is now done online to allow large parts of society to function fairly well – through video conferences and online shopping. “But it was a lazy solution to a novel coronavirus epidemic, as well as a hugely damaging one,” he adds. However, Woolhouse is at pains to reject the ideas of those who advocated the complete opening up of society, including academics who backed the Barrington Declaration which proposed the Covid-19 virus be allowed to circulate until enough people had been infected to achieve herd immunity. “This would have led to an epidemic far larger than the one we eventually experienced in 2020,” says Woolhouse. “It also lacked a convincing plan for adequately protecting the more vulnerable members of society, the elderly and those who are immuno-compromised.”
Instead, the country should have put far more effort into protecting the vulnerable. Well over 30,000 people died of Covid-19 in Britain’s care homes. On average, each home got an extra £250,000 from the government to protect against the virus, he calculates. “Much more should have been spent on providing protection for care homes,” says Woolhouse, who also castigates the government for offering nothing more than a letter telling those shielding elderly parents and other vulnerable individuals in their own homes to take precautions. The nation could have spent several thousand pounds per household on provision of routine testing and in helping to implement Covid-safe measures for those shielding others and that would still have amounted to a small fraction of the £300bn we eventually spent on our pandemic response, he argues. Indeed, Woolhouse is particularly disdainful of the neglect of “shielders”, such as care home workers and informal carers. “These people stood between the vulnerable and the virus but, for most of 2020, they got minimal recognition and received no help.” Britain spent a fortune on suppressing the virus and will still be servicing the debt incurred for generations to come, he adds. “By contrast, we spent almost nothing on protecting the vulnerable in the community. We should and could have invested in both suppression and protection. We effectively chose just one.” And Woolhouse is emphatic that further lockdowns are not the way to deal with future waves of Covid-19. “Lockdowns aren’t a public health policy. They signify a failure of public health policy,” he states. Instead, the country needs, very quickly, not to be surprised by new variants and not to respond each one in an ad hoc fashion. “We should agree a sliding scale of interventions and trigger points for implementing them. With omicron it all feels a bit chaotic. We need better planning and preparation for when the next variant arrives, as it surely will.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/britain-got-it-wrong-on-covid-long-lockdown-did-more-harm-than-good-says-scientist
5996;5996;Classical comeback: the pandemic proves the need to support musicians and orchestras;2022-01-02T08:45:12Z;['N/A'];['Music', 'Classical music', 'Culture', 'English National Opera (ENO)', 'Coronavirus'];In March 2020, live classical music and much of cultural life worldwide came to an abrupt halt overnight. Since then, we have seen the gradual reopening of concert halls in all four nations of the UK, as organisers, orchestras and musicians struggle to recover a loss of income, talent and confidence on an unprecedented scale. As we enter 2022, it’s far from life as usual. Most institutions report that only around 65% of pre-pandemic capacity had been reached before the emergence of the Omicron variant. Undoubtedly, more government intervention is needed if the sector is not to be diminished further. Music is the soundtrack to our lives and classical musicians are major contributors to the UK’s reputation for cultural innovation and excellence. However, for all of its darkness, the pandemic has allowed us to reimagine what our musical world could look like if we start from scratch. Throughout the crisis, the industry has begun to construct a new narrative shaped to accommodate great artistic expression for everyone. As we rebuild our society and our economy, I’m convinced, more than ever, that participation in music is part of the solution for national recovery. Participating in musical activity sustains us through the most perplexing and difficult moments of our lives. I have been hugely inspired by the remarkable and uplifting endorsements of the role of music within our wider community and for people of all ages and backgrounds. I have seen what music does for those living with dementia through Wigmore Hall’s pioneering Music For Life and Singing with Friends programmes. We also reach some of the most marginalised people in society, including those who have experienced homelessness, domestic abuse and children living with HIV, a forgotten minority. English National Opera’s Breathe, another example, draws on the expertise of opera singers and colleagues at Imperial College Healthcare to help hundreds of long Covid sufferers across the UK to improve their breathing and anxiety. Now rolled out to 50 health trusts nationwide, it vividly illustrates more than ever the worth of music in social prescribing. As traditional concert venues were unable to operate properly, the vision of Bold Tendencies, which 15 years ago reclaimed the Peckham multistorey car park as an exciting arts destination, for residents, with classical music at its heart, became an even more relevant blueprint for what could be emulated nationwide. Non-professional choral societies abound, connecting communities as never before. Other schemes highlighting the positive social impact of classical music include work in Hull focused on stroke recovery, mental health issues among teenagers (Sound Young Minds) and families affected by the criminal justice system (Lullaby Project). The innovative work of these institutions is just the tip of an iceberg of music lovers across the country who strive daily to embed classical music within the UK’s social fabric. Their work, abetted by the social changes precipitated by the pandemic, has resulted in a radical new musical landscape. Never before has there been such a diverse variety of classical music performed by musicians across socioeconomic, gender and racial divides. Many of our concerts or educational activities can be beamed into any home or school at little cost. A coordinated plan from government to use these amazing resources could work wonders for young people. Exposure to the arts at a young age builds confidence and empowers people to question and to explore and to make change happen. Every arts institution is doing work that could be shared with every child online. Exposure to the arts is life changing, life enhancing and the universal right of every citizen. The industry as a whole has confronted the fact that too many people encounter barriers, real or perceived, to entering, remaining in or being successful in the sector and is determined to do something about it. As Alan Davey, controller of BBC Radio 3, eloquently puts it, “The chance to experience classical music as an audience member, or to follow your talent, or choose a career in it, must not depend on your background or come about by chance.” In 2022 I hope audience confidence grows as we begin to live with, rather than be locked in by, Covid. Concert halls and opera houses are among the safest public spaces and can provide a transcendental spiritual experience for as little as a fiver. Anecdotal reports of a vibrant young audience at concerts signify an uplifting trend that will be embraced by all. We have welcomed thousands of new concertgoers at Wigmore Hall this season, a palpable source of joy for musicians, staff and older audiences alike . Further afield, Hamburg’s Elbphilharmonie celebrates its fifth anniversary, having single-handedly trebled the city’s audience. The David Geffen Hall reopens this autumn to provide a home for the New York Philharmonic. An exciting year lies ahead.

5997;5997;Trump acolytes vie for key election oversight posts in US midterms;2022-01-02T08:30:12Z;['Sam Levine'];['US news', 'US voting rights', 'Republicans', 'World news'];"When Americans go to the polls in the 2022 midterms, the most important elections won’t be for office in Washington. The most high-stakes races will be statewide contests, in some cases for long overlooked offices, that have profound consequences for the future of free and fair elections in America. The races for governor and secretary of state, the chief election official in many places, will determine which officials have control over setting election rules and the post-election certification process.
Allies of Donald Trump and others who have spread baseless conspiracy theories about the election have launched campaigns for several of those offices, both at the statewide and local level, in an effort to take control of election machinery. Trump is expected to run for president in 2024, and if his allies are successful, there are fears they could use their positions to block Trump’s opponent from taking office should Trump lose. Democrats are seeking to hold on to governor’s offices in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, three crucial swing states. The Democratic incumbents in all three states have blocked efforts by GOP-led legislatures to enact voting restrictions so far. There will also be hotly contested elections in Arizona and Georgia, where Republican candidates who have spread lies about the results of the 2020 election are running for governor. Republicans who have embraced lies about the election are also running for secretary of state offices in Michigan, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. Overlooked for years, there is now a broader awareness of the enormous power these secretaries of state wield over how elections are run and ballots are counted. That power was on unprecedented display in 2020, when secretaries of state made decisions about things like how to establish ballot drop boxes and whether to automatically send out mail-in ballot applications to voters. Secretaries of state wield enormous unilateral power and, if they were elected, election deniers could do extensive damage in future elections. “It feels like the future of democracy depends on our wins,” said Jena Griswold, Colorado’s secretary of state, who is chair of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State. Few states better encapsulate the stakes for 2022 than Wisconsin. Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat seeking re-election, vetoed a suite of new voting restrictions in August, but Republicans are still chomping at the bit to overhaul the state’s election system. Republicans have launched their own, widely criticized review of the 2020 election and are pushing to get rid of the bipartisan election commission that runs elections in the state. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin’s Republican US senator, has called for the legislature to unilaterally take control of federal elections. Rebecca Kleefisch, a leading Republican candidate for governor, has said she would eliminate the agency if elected. She has also refused to say whether she supports legislation that would allow the Wisconsin legislature, where Republicans essentially hold a permanent majority because of gerrymandering, to overturn election results. Kleefisch’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
There’s a similar dynamic in Michigan. After Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat seeking re-election, vetoed a package of new voting restrictions, Republicans moved aggressively to try to enact them around her veto. There’s also a push to unseat Jocelyn Benson, Michigan’s top election official, who became one of the most visible secretaries of state in 2020 when she took steps to make it easier to vote by mail. One of the leading candidates in the GOP field vying to replace Benson is Kristina Karamo, endorsed by Trump, who has claimed Antifa was responsible for the 6 January attack, accused Democrats and Republicans of being “traitors”, and falsely said there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Karamo’s campaign did not respond to an interview request. “It’s certainly not by accident that we’re seeing individuals who don’t believe in democracy aspire to be our state’s’ chief election officers, particularly in the states that were under the greatest spotlight in 2020,” Benson said in an interview. “Observers of democracy should be very concerned about what appears to be a coordinated effort to place people in positions of authority over elections who do not believe in elections and would have willingly overturned election results.” Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf, a term-limited Democrat, also vetoed GOP-backed voting restrictions earlier this year. The GOP candidates running to replace him include Lou Barletta, a former congressman and close Trump ally who has supported the false claim that the election was stolen. Doug Mastriano, a state senator and Trump ally who is one of the most prominent advocates of the election fraud narrative, is also weighing a campaign. Mastriano was at the US capitol on 6 January, pushed baseless voter fraud claims to the justice department, and championed an unusual post-election review in Pennsylvania. In Arizona, Trump has endorsed Kari Lake, a former news anchor seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination who has called for “decertifying” the 2020 election results, something that is not legally possible. Mark Finchem, a Republican state representative who attended the 6 January rally has called for “decertification” of the election results as well. And in Georgia, Trump has endorsed former GOP senator David Perdue in a primary challenge to Republican governor Brian Kemp. Trump has fumed at Kemp, blaming him for not doing enough to overturn the election results last year. Perdue has said he would not have certified the 2020 election results, even after several recounts and audits showed no widespread fraud. The winner will face Stacey Abrams, who made defending voting rights a core issue in her 2018 gubernatorial campaign and has focused on it since.
Republicans are also seeking to oust Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state who refused to find enough votes to overturn the election for Trump. Trump’s pick to replace Raffensperger is Jody Hice, a GOP congressman who supported Trump’s efforts to overturn the election. Griswold, who is also running for re-election in 2022, said that putting someone who doesn’t believe in elections in charge of running them was akin to “putting an arsonist in charge of the fire department”. While she said she has been encouraged by a surge in interest among grassroots activists and some donors in secretary of state races, “it is not enough”. “Imagine on January 6 if you had secretaries of state, disregarding all fact, disregarding all law, saying the election was stolen,” she said. “That is what may be coming.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/trump-acolytes-crucial-election-oversight-posts-2022-midterms
5998;5998;After her conviction, let’s call Ghislaine Maxwell what she is – a sex trafficker, not a socialite | Joan Smith;2022-01-02T08:30:12Z;['Joan Smith'];['Ghislaine Maxwell', 'Crime', 'UK news', 'US news', 'Jeffrey Epstein', 'Prince Andrew'];"For years, she was described as a “socialite”, a word that conceals more than it explains. Socialites are almost always women from a wealthy if not an aristocratic background and their defining characteristic is being photographed with famous people. Ghislaine Maxwell fitted the bill, appearing in photos with everyone from Donald Trump to Elon Musk to Prince Andrew. But being a socialite is not a job and it was unclear how she financed her opulent lifestyle, especially after the death of her father, Robert. Over recent weeks, during her trial on sex trafficking charges in a New York courtroom, the answer became clear. Maxwell’s wealth came from her erstwhile boyfriend, the financier Jeffrey Epstein, who gave her at least $30.7m (£23m) over a period of eight years. By all accounts, Maxwell went from being in love with him to discovering that her usefulness lay elsewhere, in providing a steady stream of young girls to satisfy his depraved sexual appetite. The girls trusted her, thinking of her as an older sister, and only realised later that they had been betrayed. The “socialite” was actually a procurer, a word with deservedly unpleasant connotations. It does not sit easily with Maxwell’s glamorous lifestyle – the planes, helicopters and visits to Epstein’s private island. Many well-known people will surely be regretting that they ever moved in the same circles as Maxwell and Epstein, let alone appear in the aircraft logs revealed in court. Indeed, Maxwell’s conviction last week on five charges seems to have created a kind of cognitive dissonance in some circles, as though such things simply should not happen to a woman with a degree from Balliol . Well-connected individuals who rarely display an interest in American penal policy have complained bitterly about Maxwell’s prison conditions, as though she is in a different class from other inmates. (Assumptions about class are, of course, all over this case.) Her siblings have rallied round, insisting that they cannot accept the jury’s guilty verdicts, although that seems to be more an expression of denial than in any real expectation that she will win an appeal. We know from rape trials that the public imagination struggles to accommodate individuals who challenge stereotypes about sex offenders, whether it is the good-looking date who turns out to be a rapist or the “socialite” who facilitates a paedophile. It is easier to believe terrible things about Rosemary West, a dumpy, working-class woman who helped lure girls into her husband’s car and joined in his abuse of them, than an heiress who once rested her boot on the thigh of an entranced Boris Johnson. Fred and Rose West committed horrific crimes together, torturing their victims as well as killing them, but Fred West was already a murderer when he chose 15-year-old Rosemary Letts, who had a horrendous history of childhood sexual abuse, as his accomplice.
Predators have a sixth sense when it comes to choosing co-conspirators. Maxwell was a grown woman when she met Epstein, and fully responsible for the choices she would go on to make, but it is striking that their relationship seems to have begun around the time of her father’s fatal fall from the yacht he named after her, the Lady Ghislaine. It is no excuse to say that the discovery that her father was a fraudster, so soon after his death, would have shaken Maxwell to her foundations. But it may be that Epstein recognised her weaknesses, seized his chance – and got access to an address book that included the Queen’s favourite son, the Duke of York. Maxwell’s connections boosted his sense of impunity, which is perhaps the single most important factor in allowing predators to get away with their crimes. He would later describe Maxwell in humiliating terms as an ex-girlfriend who had fallen on hard times, framing himself as the benefactor who had allowed her to live in the style to which she had become accustomed. The mystery surrounding the source of Epstein’s wealth has led to comparisons with Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic main character in Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, but such mythologising lends a spurious glamour to sordid crimes. It is a depressing fact that women who identify with powerful men often share their misogyny and reflect it back in a desperate quest for approval. Profiles of Epstein remarked on the disturbing fact that his homes were full of teenage girls. “They’re nothing, these girls,” Maxwell once told a confidante. “They are trash.” It must have occurred to Maxwell by now that the two men she put absolute faith in, her father and her ex-lover, both left her to face the music after their apparent suicides. And for what? The columnist Barbara Amiel, who is married to the former newspaper magnate Conrad Black, recalls a conversation that shows Maxwell in an unexpected and highly unflattering light. “I bet I’m in charge of more lavatories and bathrooms than you are,” Maxwell suddenly said as the two women were walking along a beach. While Amiel thought about it, Maxwell reminded her to include those on planes. “Thirty-nine,” said Amiel and Maxwell’s face lit up. “I win,” she exclaimed. Questions about Maxwell’s relationship with Epstein have now been cleared up. She procured girls for him and it speaks volumes about her moral compass, or lack of it, that she evidently cared more about the number of lavatories in his mansions than the vulnerable teenagers she exposed to sexual assault and rape. • Joan Smith is a journalist and author of books including Misogynies and Home Grown: How Domestic Violence Turns Men Into Terrorists";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/lets-call-ghislaine-maxwell-what-she-is-a-heartless-sex-offender-not-a-fallen-socialite
5999;5999;Why are we breeding such ugly flowers?;2022-01-02T08:15:12Z;['James Wong'];['Gardening advice', 'Life and style', 'Gardens'];"There are a few cultural conundrums out there in gardening which I wonder if I will ever get to the bottom of. As someone who has recently gotten into dabbling in a little home-breeding with rare begonia species, here is one that perpetually fascinates me, even if merely mentioning is likely to get me cancelled: why are so many new plant cultivars so hideous? If you have flicked through any major gardening catalogue recently, you will know what I mean, especially when it comes to bedding plants. Cultivars with ever-more fluorescent hues, often with jarring colour breaks, where highlighter-pink juts up against Day-Glo acid green. Breeders will often layer up these mutations, too, with ruffled petals, dramatically variegated leaves and flowers so huge the poor plants can barely hold them up. Short of spraying them in glitter and dunking them in gold paint, there is very little else you could do to a plant to make it more dazzling.
Now, I am fully aware of how much of a terrible horticultural snob this makes me, and also of the incredible level of breeding ingenuity and dedication that is needed to achieve this level of tackiness. However, my question – personal taste aside – is whether these cultivars are any good for horticulture. I absolutely recognise the importance of having a huge range of plant options to help support the widest diversity of gardening styles, but how many people do these Barbara-Cartland-meets-Drag-Race varieties really appeal to? Are they created this way because the aesthetic barometer that breeders work to – as with many cultural aspects in horticulture – is a few decades out of date? After all, plant breeding is a notoriously slow process. These varieties would make perfect sense in an era when crocheted loo-roll covers or chintzy potpourri were commonplace in interior design. But they are totally out of step with really every current trend in fashion, graphic design, architecture and interiors. Is it because these are simply the most common genetic quirks that come up when plant breeders are searching for novel traits? Variegation, colour breaks and ruffled petals are indeed some of the most common mutations that occur, for example, when plant breeders try to induce them using things such as gamma radiation. So is it more about the function of the characteristics that are available to play with, rather than the aesthetic goal they are actively working towards? Or is it just the thirst for novelty? If all you are searching for is something that stands out as visually different in a sea of thousands of identical plants on a breeding bench, maybe that starts to take precedence over something that actually looks good. Who knows? It’s so depressing to see such a diverse range of plants, from begonias and fuchsias to petunias, that look so impossibly elegant, exotic and, above all, different from each other in the wild, all being turned into the same frilly, marshmallowy, pompoms that are virtually interchangeable. They aren’t just in horrible taste, they all look the flipping same. Am I alone in wondering this? Or have a I just become one of the terribly opinionated gardening snobs I have always tried my best to avoid?

My signature New Year cocktail is three parts relief to two of fomo with a smugness garnish as I wake early and contemplate stripping the house of every glittering shred of festivity, a prospect somehow as appealing as decorating it a few weeks previously. (I revert to puritanical zealot instantly after New Year, grimly relishing the dark months of fingerless gloves and gruel, while my French husband tries in vain to make his decadent, continental epiphany happen, with its greasy wodge of almond galette, filling-menacing charm, and paper crown.) Even so, something about that “old acquaintance” part is stuck in my head, displacing my usual involuntary theme tune (Kung Fu Fighting – you’re welcome). I think a lot about “old acquaintance” at the moment. Partly, it’s because returning to my home town three years ago means I live in a nostalgia minefield, everywhere liable to detonate a tiny, usually benign, charge of emotion. The waiter from the pizzeria we went to when my mother couldn’t face cooking is still waitering a few hundred yards away; my biology teacher is teaching my son biology; my schoolfriends’ parents still live in the same streets. At choir practice a woman I did not recognise came over with a card with a cat on. “Do you recognise this cat?” she asked. I didn’t, but it was a birthday card addressed to me, with a 1980s postmark. It had, she said, been kicking around her house for decades, and she had no idea why. I would have run a mile from that feeling of being held in a web of connectedness even a decade ago, but now it’s comforting to be seen and known. But it’s also the times, I think. Isolation, pent-up boredom, a hunger for humans other than our cohabitees and that wave of lockdown nostalgia for a time before LFTs and social distancing, back when QR codes were still as ridiculous as Google Glass, have conspired to make “absent friends” an urgent project rather than a vague regret. Surely it’s no coincidence that last year saw both the Friends and the Sex and the City reunions: we’re hungry for reassurance that even when we need reading glasses and HRT or end up looking like Matt LeBlanc, ressembling a benign, slightly confused Irish uncle, we still remain ourselves, that we can still slip into well-worn grooves of connection.
A university friend, a primary school classmate and a former neighbour made contact last year, conjuring names I did not know I remembered until I heard them again. I have found myself thinking about my own ones that got away: schoolfriends and colleagues from crappy jobs, doomed dates or group therapy fellow travellers. My new phone backed up recently to a contacts list that is a blast from the past in itself: I scroll through it in baffled wonder. Who was “Liam’s Dad” or “Matthew handyman”? Is Elke still working in Brussels airport? How is my son’s speech therapist from 2008 doing, or the dogsitter from 2010 who sent me a picture of the dog on a sofa eating pâté on toast for Christmas dinner (no wonder life with me is a grave disappointment for him since)? I don’t think we necessarily want, or need, to rekindle most of these relationships. They were often a product of geography and circumstance that has shifted. It’s more about exploring the tendrils of connection and reassuring ourselves that we are still social creatures. In 1993, anthropologist Robin Dunbar set a figure for how many meaningful relationships our neocortex can maintain: 150 (though Swedish research last year argued we can manage far more). I doubt many of us are maintaining anywhere near that many IRL connections at the moment, but our “Dunbar’s number” is bolstered by memories and virtual connections we nourish. Remembering getting so drunk with Caro that I had to leave the Woman in White after 10 minutes, or sprinting through Barcelona airport with Nic when we spent too long buying cakes (is that the equivalent of Robbie Burns’s “ran about the braes”?), feels comforting, like turning on lights in a half-empty house. That was Burns’s point, I think: the not forgetting matters; the “brought to mind”. But if there is an old acquaintance you think about a lot or a missed connection you regret, perhaps don’t assume they will drift back into your life when, or if, it’s meant to be. I got a message this week that Fred, an exuberant, intermittent presence in my life from 10 or so years ago, a warm, flawed, funny man with an irrepressible appetite for creating quotidian drama, had died. Of course, the memories are still there, but for the ones that really matter, send the awkward message; share the cringey reminiscence. For Robbie’s sake.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/if-old-acquaintances-are-brought-to-mind-give-them-a-call
6001;6001;Licorice Pizza – Paul Thomas Anderson’s joyously nostalgic coming-of-age tale;2022-01-02T08:00:13Z;['Mark Kermode'];['Drama films', 'Film', 'Paul Thomas Anderson', 'Haim', 'Culture', 'John C Reilly', 'Bradley Cooper'];"There’s something propulsively intoxicating about the films of Paul Thomas Anderson. Watching Punch-Drunk Love left me in exactly the state described by the title; Inherent Vice demanded to be inhaled rather than watched; I wanted to wrap myself in the poisonous couture of Phantom Thread. Anderson’s latest takes its title from a hip record store (reportedly named after an Abbott and Costello gag), and appropriately enough the result spun me round like a record. This is heady stuff, an evocation of the San Fernando valley in the early 70s, as personally nostalgic as George Lucas’s American Graffiti, albeit with an insanely adventurous edge. Screen newcomer Cooper Hoffman (son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) is Gary Valentine, a high-schooler with a Brian Wilson haircut who’s also a child actor and go-getting entrepreneur. “Where are your parents while all this is happening?” asks Alana (musician and feature first-timer Alana Haim), the twentysomething Gary meets when she’s working as an assistant to the school photographer, and whom he declares to be “the girl I’m going to marry one day”, despite her insistence that “we are not boyfriend and girlfriend”. When Gary needs a chaperone to accompany him to a New York TV special, Alana (upon whose expressively reactive face the movie rests) goes along for the ride, only to fall for his fantastically smug co-star Lance (Skyler Gisondo). But Gary has his sights set on higher things – a waterbed business (“liquid luxury for you!”) in which Alana becomes his partner, keeping them together even as she insists that they will never be “together”.
Partly inspired by the early-life adventures of film and TV producer Gary Goetzman, Licorice Pizza pinballs between seemingly random episodes, taking us from a teenage fair (where John C Reilly cameos as Herman Munster) to the Encino hills via fiery motorcycle stunts with movie stars (Sean Penn as a William Holden-esque screen veteran) and close calls with police and politicians (Benny Safdie as mayoral hopeful Joel Wachs) – all played out against the end-of-days background noise of the Opec oil crisis. There’s also a completely unhinged encounter with Jon Peters, the hairdresser turned producer whom Bradley Cooper plays as a wild-eyed cross between Charles Manson and Hart Bochner’s sleazy executive from Die Hard. Bizarrely, what begins as a reprise of the drug-crazed Alfred Molina scene from Boogie Nights mutates unexpectedly into an LA-bound remake of The Wages of Fear, with kids instead of dynamite as the truck’s volatile cargo. What keeps it all grounded is the fact that, in the midst of all this madness, our central odd couple remain entirely believable. From the strangely infantalising hubbub of Alana’s family (played by Haim’s real-life relatives) to Gary’s peculiar half-man/half-boy existence, Licorice Pizza makes us accept a relationship that has something of the dysfunctional charm of Hal Ashby’s Harold and Maude. As for the eclectic jukebox soundtrack, in which tunes such as the Chico Hamilton Quintet’s Blue Sands play contrapuntally across tone-shifting scenes, that put me in mind of Ashby’s other masterpiece, Coming Home. “Do you think it’s weird that I hang out with Gary and his friends all the time?” Alana asks in a moment of blazed reflection, wondering how she wound up with a bunch of 15-year-olds. “It’s whatever you think it is,” comes the reply – and it’s a credit to the movie that we tend to agree. Elsewhere, there’s a divisively absurdist turn by John Michael Higgins as the proprietor of a Japanese restaurant, whose language skills extend only to a pantomime accent, and a killer appearance by Harriet Sansom Harris as agent Mary Grady, who tells Alana: “You remind me of an English pit-bull dog, with sex appeal and a very Jewish nose.” But this is Gary and Alana’s movie, and it’s them that we will remember: his open-faced smile; her left-handed scowl; the giddy way they run through streets together. “How did we survive?” asks Gary after one particularly reckless episode, a question most of us have surely asked ourselves. Like all the best evocations of times past, Licorice Pizza has no answers – only an enraptured sense of awe that makes Anderson’s joyous film feel like a very personal memory.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/02/licorice-pizza-paul-thomas-andersons-joyously-nostalgic-coming-of-age-tale
6002;6002;Lost your get up and go? Here’s how to get it back;2022-01-02T08:00:13Z;['Martin Love'];['Fitness', 'Life and style', 'Coronavirus', 'Sport', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Mental health', 'Health'];"On my parents’ mantelpiece, among the pictures of smiling grandchildren, lopsided graduation hats, old sports cars and a young soldier in smart uniform, is a picture of heroic athletic endeavour. In a little silver frame is a small blond boy in a white vest straining every sinew as he belts around the corner of a grassy athletic field, the parallel lines of the track marked out in white chalk stretching into the distance. He seems to be so far ahead of the pack that he’s almost on his own. He’s a champion in the making! Is the podium ready? Is that the music from Chariots of Fire you can hear? The sad truth is that the little boy is me and I was so far off the pace everyone else that my dad was able to step out on the track to take the picture. “You were miles behind. It was almost as if you were running in slow motion,” he says now, with a laugh. I must have been about eight years old. I remember the day so clearly. My teeth aren’t clenched with the exertion of the race, but because I was terrified I was about to burst into tears. My cheeks burned more than my thighs did, but all for nothing. I can still recall the journey home, gazing enviously at the brace of medals my brother had picked up – as he always did. “Speedy Pete” we called him. Today, I have a shoebox full of medals tucked under my bed. My hidden vice is that even now, at the boyish age of 56, I like to get them out and jangle them across my palms, let them swing around my neck. But thinking back, it’s that little photo that captures one of the most inspiring moments of my sporting life. I didn’t give up. I was last, but I finished the race. And I’ve never stopped – until now. Today, I still love running. Exercise plays a huge part in my life, both physically and mentally. Exertion keeps me ticking over and helps me tackle the mundanities of the daily grind. It keeps me up when I feel down. It’s the wellspring of my wellbeing. Running, swimming, cycling… I’m like a wild-eyed hamster on speed, spinning away on my various wheels, mostly getting nowhere. But through my perpetual motion I get to stay balanced in one place. I’ve run dozens of marathons (38 to be precise – marathon runners never lose count, they always know), I’ve cycled the length and breadth of Britain (and France, and Spain, and a bit of Holland), I’ve never passed a body of water without an overwhelming urge to strip off and dive in… So why then, as the pandemic took hold of the country, did I come to a shuddering stop? As others got started, I ground to a halt. The parks filled with joggers, sitting rooms everywhere were a blur of squats and burpees, but I couldn’t be fagged to walk to the end of the garden and back. I want to know where my motivation went? And, more importantly, how can I get it back again? On a cold and crisp morning in December I visit the deterministically named Max Sharp. I toy with asking him how I can “max up my sharpness”, but instead settle for an elbow bump and a hello. Sharp, 51, is the owner and manager of the FitFor gym and rehabilitation centre on Lordship Lane in south London. There’s an encouraging sign on the door as you go in that states: “Do Not Enter if you are showing any signs of Covid, Racism or Homophobia.” As you’d hope from a man who spends most of his time in and around gyms, Sharp looks fit, energetic and… well, sharp. He also seems very calm. He says his guilty secret is that he still plays competitive rugby every weekend, to the horror of his partner. “In the last few years, I’ve broken more bones on the pitch than you’d believe. But I just can’t stop,” he adds with a smile.
“Just before the first lockdown,” Sharp tells me, “gym membership across the country was at about 15%. That’s the highest it’s ever been. Then Lockdown One happened and there was a wave of enthusiasm with everyone running around, doing exercise videos at home, and getting outside for that one precious walk a day we were allowed. In Lockdown Two that exercise effect was less pronounced, but it was still there. Then Lockdown Three happened and everyone seemed to just give up. Sitting at home eating crisps and drinking beer was our top choice.” Why did that happen? “I think it was because we all got progressively more pissed off, more housebound, more reclusive,” Sharp says, “and that then had an incipient effect on our general motivation. We all shrank. Our outlook shrank, too.” That makes sense, but the big question, of course, is how can we put that into reverse? I’m hoping there is a large switch hidden deep inside our brains that can be flicked back on, like an old fuse box, and start us leaping off sofas again, swapping packets of biscuits for a ton of crunches. Sharp shakes his head. Sadly that’s not the case. But there are things we can do to kickstart the motivation revolution. The lucky ones are already “gym evangelists,” he says. “These are the hardcore people who simply snap back.” They will get their exercise fix whatever. They will always find a way to get a session in. “But they are the minority – the challenge comes in encouraging the rest of us, who know we should exercise, who know there are clear health benefits, who want to come back and want to keep coming back, but just don’t.” It’s a cliché of exercise that the “first step is the hardest”. That short walk from your front door to the park, or the gym, or the pool or the pitch can have more insurmountable obstacles on it than the most exhausting Tough Mudder event. Forget rope nets, hero walls and muddy trenches, putting away the shopping or tidying up the spice rack, even gazing out the window can pose a far greater hurdle to you pulling on your trainers and jogging round the block. “The people who are hardest to motivate,” says Sharp, “are those who don’t have exercise in their experience or understanding, who dislike the very idea of exertion.” For them, it’s usually a life event that triggers an interest. It’s often a health warning, for them or a family member, that gets them going. But even a growing awareness that you are more out of breath at the top of the stairs or can’t dig the garden without putting your back out, can be enough to act as a wake-up call. If you hear that alarm, pay attention. It might just turn your life around. And from a public health standpoint, there is growing evidence that even doing light exercise, breaking up the sedentary time with a little walk, can be beneficial. It doesn’t always have to be about exertion. In an unexpected way the pandemic gave many of us a chance to start again, just as the New Year always does. New Year, New You, and all that. Covid allowed us to adjust our routines and try a fresh approach. Motivation is a battle between life choices and time demands: the siren call of the pub vs the dread of another bums-and-tums class. During the various lockdowns we didn’t have much to do. The endless competition for our time stopped. There was a lot less either or. There was also a generalised feeling that we should try to get fit in the face of a health emergency to give ourselves a fighting chance. But once the novelty of a new beginning grows stale, a very different type of motivation is needed to keep going. As we slowly returned to normality and the temptations of restaurants, clubs and cinemas came back into play, our newfound exercise evangelism got zipped back into a smelly gym bag and forgotten about. Staying motivated about motivation is challenging. But one person knows a lot more about it than most. Joan Duda is professor of sport and exercise psychology at the University of Birmingham. She’s spent the past 25 years working with all levels of athletes and performers, on the “determinants of adherence and optimal functioning in sport, exercise, and dance”. She is also the founder of Empowering Coaching, training programmes for coaches, instructors and parents regarding how to “create more optimally motivating environments and experiences”. I am confident that she will have much to tell me – a middle-aged man who has lost his mojo for plodding round the park.
“We know from our research,” Professor Duda tells me, “that if you participate for autonomous reasons – because you want to rather than because you feel you have to, then you are much more likely to maintain physical activity. It is also important to engage because the activity is enjoyable or helps you realise personally valued goals.” Umm, does she mean it should be fun? “That would help!” she says. “We are more likely to keep moving if we can find activities that are fun, interesting, perhaps personally challenging and we can see ourselves improving. And, of course, moving doesn’t need to be exhausting to be beneficial. Just getting outside and taking a walk with the dog or going on a bike ride with friends can bring on our inner smile and give us energy.” When it comes to long-term motivation, Professor Duda and her fellow researchers are becoming increasingly aware that self-identity is also a big deciding factor. If you see yourself as a runner, an exerciser, a person who goes to gyms and leads a healthy life, it’s much easier to live up to those ideals. Instead of “doing” exercise, we need to think of ourselves as “being” a person who is physically active. It is part of who we are; part of our life. These “be” motives are less mentally exhausting than “should” motives. It all sounds rather Buddhist, but you need to embrace your “I am an active person” identity. This identity can take years to develop. Sharp tells me that he has clients who come to his gym three or four times a week and still tell him “that they aren’t really people who go to the gym”. I’m still not sure what’s happened to my motivation, though. I like exercise and I see myself as an “exerciser”. More than that, taking part in exercise has brought me so many happy experiences. It’s also the foundation of some of my most enduring and rewarding friendships. I understand the health benefits it brings. I know I’ll feel better if I go for a run, no matter what the weather or how bad the hangover. Joggers like to gee themselves up by saying things like: “You never regret a run!” and “Find your happy pace!” And that inner voice has always been enough to get me up and out there, but recently the urge to pull on my trainers has petered out. I can’t be bothered any more.
It’s a matter of routine, says Sharp. “When you are in the habit, your endocrine system kicks in. Your body gives you a dopamine hit that you soon get hooked on. It’s good stuff. If that goes, it’s hard to find it again. But it’s just a habit that you need to reacquire. And habits take time and a bit of grunt. We’ve been forced into a cosy state of hibernation over the past two years. We need to return to our old patterns.” Sharp tells me in simple terms: “If you start again you’ll soon find your body’s hormonal system will reward you and it will become easier and easier to keep it up.” Not for nothing is Nike’s slogan still: “Just do it.” I decide to speak to an old friend named Graham. He’s a former county-level runner and as far as I know has never taken a break from running. “That’s not true,” he tells me. “I often stop, or take breaks. Honestly, I just get bored of it sometimes. So I stop for a few days or a few weeks, but then something changes – it might be the weather or I’ll hear a piece of music – and I feel that itch to get back out there.” “I’ve lost my itch,” I tell him mournfully. Graham laughs and points out that when he’s injured it’s awful to start with. “I feel frustrated and irritated.” But after a while he seems to be able to shut off his “running need”. The problem then “is relocating it when I’ve recovered and I’m back on my feet”. I know what he means and realise that, over the years, perhaps unconsciously, I have done similar things. I’ll enter an event that forces me to train and so get back into my groove; or I’ll treat myself to new shoes and feel I should go running so they aren’t wasted. I’ll watch a trail race on YouTube and fantasise about running stride for stride with the best. And, inevitably, I’ll find that itch and that will get me going again. Towards the end of December, my 20-year-old daughter sends me a snap from university. She is at Oxford and has discovered that the track across the road from her student accommodation is not just any track, it’s where Roger Bannister broke the 4-minute mile in 1954. And there it is, suddenly I feel a familiar tingle. I realise this is exactly what I’ve been waiting for. The track is open to members who can also sign in a guest, so on a blustery afternoon the two of us wander across the grass to the famous 400m track. We decide to run a mile. We don’t bother setting a timer, no records are going to fall. We trot round laughing brightly under a grey sky. It’s fantastic. I feel my legs stretch and my chest start to rise and fall. It’s wonderful to be running on this fabled surface. But more importantly, it’s even better to hear the old familiar rumble of motivation in the distance… Staying the course Five ways to rediscover (and keep) your mojo 1. Do something you like Choose a sport or activity that suits you. It’s so much easier to do something you enjoy. Many gyms offer taster weeks where you can sample lots of classes. Do what you want to rather than what you think you should. You’ll be more likely to stick with a sport you like. 2. Good or bad doesn’t matter Don’t worry what level you are at. Think of yourself as a physically active person. Walk when you can; take the stairs not the lift. Choose the active option whenever you can. 3. Make it simple Get your kit ready beforehand. Choose a time of day that works for you. Find a friend or “gym buddy” to go with. When you finish, schedule the next session. No excuses. 4. Think about numbers Tracker apps and biofeedback tech can be motivational. Men in particular seem to do more exercise if they can track it. 5. Habit of a lifetime Make exercise part of your routine. Be an exerciser. You’ve got this! Put yourself in the zone Whether it’s cooking something delicious, being more playful or dancing on your own, experts from all walks of life explain how to maintain your motivation.

‘Find your sense of flow’: Philippa Perry, psychotherapist and OM’s agony aunt It doesn’t matter if it’s your work or not, it is important to practise a skill. Not something you are necessarily good at but something that you get better at, something that takes skill and concentration but you can do it and almost automatically. In other words, we need to find something that gives us a sense of flow. Flow is a concept that the psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi came up with. It is a state achieved when you are absorbed in a task, so much so that the outside world seems to diminish. The trick is to balance your skill with the challenge of the task. If it’s too difficult you get frustrated, too easy and you get bored – to be in flow we need to find that sweet spot in the middle. Sometimes this is called being in “the zone”. The activity that gets you there should be done for its own sake, because it feels good to do it. One of the concepts I use in my psychotherapy practice is that of internal and external referencing. When we internally reference we are noticing how what we are doing feels to us alone; when we externally reference, we are more concerned about how it appears to others. To be in flow, we need to internally reference, this is not about how results look to others but how we feel when we are absorbed in the activity itself. Many things have brought me to a state of flow from learning to bake, to writing my column, or more recently, picking up where I left off at art school and developing my painting skills. The point of whatever activity you do is to enjoy it because of the satisfaction of focusing on the task in hand and being absorbed by it. Everyone could do with developing this type of enjoyment in their lives. It shouldn’t be a luxury.
‘Cooking for yourself can bind you together again’: Andi Oliver, chef I used to have a very serious eating disorder, so I’m vigilant about food and language: the idea that some food is clean and other dirty is dangerous – it’s not a healthy way to think about our bodies, eliciting guilt. Too often when people want to eat “healthily”, they take out all the fun from food. Inevitably, it can’t be sustained. Instead, this January, reinvigorate how you eat by adding colour, and taking time. If you wear bright colours, you feel uplifted. The same applies to eating food: eat browns and greys, you’ll feel that way. Colours bring a joyful vibrancy to your plate, and they’re also a great way to broaden your imagination, helping you identify what’s missing from a meal. A dash of orange gives you squashes, gourds and pumpkins; spinach and chard adds a burst of green. I tend to make a five-day soup to see me through the week in winter – deeply flavoured broths which warm you inside and out. After Christmas, I take the bones and roast them to extract all the flavour, starting a stock by adding everything that’s going a little moody in the fridge. I have a bowl next to the cooker for all my vegetable peelings and chuck that in with garlic, aromatics and herbs. Take your time, let it simmer for hours. You’ll start to feel better as the smell flows around your home. This is your base for an entire week of meals. Food shouldn’t be a place of flagellation, but jubilation. The nutrients shoot to your brain, the warmth will physically soothe you, and the act of making something beautiful will fill your soul once more. When the world feels cold and dark, you need to give yourself love and tenderness. Food is the perfect place to start.
‘Play is what makes life bearable’: Michael Rosen, author Staying silly has always been important to me, it comes from my strong sense of the absurd. The way I see it, there really isn’t much reason why we’re on Earth. When we’re focused entirely on daily troubles and chores, we don’t notice it’s all ultimately pointless. So why not try to look for fun while it lasts? It’s easy to be drawn into the doom of human existence. I have to remind myself that there’s no point to spending a life being totally miserable. You may as well enjoy it before we inevitably die. At times, that can be hard. I had Covid, and struggled afterwards. I knew the world before I became ill. I’d become accustomed to my senses of sound and sight. The virus damaged my eye and ear, and so the world changed, becoming fragmented. At first, it was hard not to think of the world as having been spoiled. Instead, I now focus on how strange it is that my perceptions have changed after so many decades. Deciphering the world is a whole new challenge, it needn’t be melancholic. It’s an adventure, a strange new game. Play, for me, is what makes life bearable, when we’re walking, shopping, working, letting our minds run free and wild. For me, much of the time, that means playing with words. I discovered when my son died that I’m less bothered by things if I write about them. Some are straightforwardly lighthearted and jolly. But penning a poem about sadness or a sense of loss can leave you feeling better as well. It helps, laying things down on paper. I call it “unfolding”. Everyone can do this, it doesn’t take expertise. Think of it as doodling, but with words. There’s a tyranny to education: learning to write frees you, but we’re restricted by being taught that formal sentences are all that’s worthwhile. Instead, scribble down fragments – think up half-lines mixed with song lyrics, lines from films, things people say. Don’t overthink it – it’s like talking with your pen. This process is a liberation for the mind.
‘It’s our primal right to move’: Tracy Anderson, fitness expert to the stars It’s our primal right to move – that’s always my starting point with the people I work with. It doesn’t matter what your movement looks like; you don’t need to look like anyone else. My mom has owned a ballet school for decades. When I was little, she wouldn’t let me into her class because she wanted me to learn to move in my own body before anyone else told me how to. Today, if you feel you don’t know how to move, find a place to be alone and turn on your music. However awkward or embarrassed you feel, don’t stop until something makes you want to move. Exercise helps with depression and anxiety. From sex to energy, creativity to contentment, exercise is the fastest way to give your body a boost. Stepping into something that’s formalised will help you keep your efforts up. I sometimes think it helps to think of yourself as a child, but also the parent: would you let a kid you are responsible for sit around staring at screens and eating sugar all day? In which case, why let yourself?
‘Resilience comes from hard graft’: Joe Simpson, mountaineer and author Resilience is a state of mind, not something you’re born with. Look at top athletes, who train hard and commit completely: if they didn’t give a toss, they’d fail. As a mountaineer, you realise this quickly – there’s no special quality you possess which helps you, but a skillset developed over many years. You know you can endure because you have specific knowledge and experience, technical knowhow and trust in your team. Much of mountaineering results in failure – you’re at the mercy of the elements over which you have no control. The first thing a climber does after something goes wrong is analyse what happened. What went right? What didn’t? What can I learn? There’s no reason why we shouldn’t apply this logic to all walks of life. It might not sound sexy, but resilience comes from hard graft. Losing teaches us a huge amount. And when something really bad happens, like when I had my own near-fatal fall in Peru in the 1980s, focusing on the small things was enough to keep me going. Right, I’d say to myself, let’s not die today. That was a victory enough. I’d repeat the same thing the next day. It’s when we’re up against it that we remember we are designed to survive.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/lost-your-get-up-and-go-heres-how-to-get-it-back

But, unless Gabriel Martinelli can be converted into a centre‑forward, it’s asking a lot for the youngsters to keep shouldering the scoring burden – hence the links with Dusan Vlahovic and Mason Greenwood. With players off to the Africa Cup of Nations, we might well need bolstering in midfield, too: Milan’s Franck Kessié, Renato Sanches from Lille and Leipzig’s Tyler Adams are on the radar. • Bernard Azulay goonersdiary.co.uk @GoonerN5
Aston Villa It’s hard to know what’s on Steven Gerrard’s mind but I doubt we’ll be overly active: we’re gaining coherence on the park and can wait to the summer. Lazy journalists/click-baiters have us “raiding” Rangers but that’s unlikely, and it’d be pretty low behaviour. We probably need cover at full‑back and at No 6, though, and of course there’s always room for top players, even if it meant moving on good servants such as Trézéguet and El Ghazi. Poaching Sarr or Saint‑Maximin would be coups. Unlikely, yes, but I’d be thrilled. • Jonathan Pritchard Brentford We don’t usually dabble in January given the prices, but we do need depth at right-back and, having not replaced Saïd Benrahma, a left winger. We’ve a couple of bids out on players, so fingers crossed. It’s been interesting to see how we’re spreading our net further: usually our transfer targets are in Denmark or France, now it’s Brazil, Ukraine and, er, Nottingham. The number of ins and outs will depend on when players are due back from injury, but keeper Jonas Lössl is joining on loan to tide us over. Marcus Forss and Dominic Thompson could go out on loan. • Billy Grant Beesotted podcast and blog; @Beesotted; @BillyTheBee99 Brighton It looks like Aaron Connelly is off on loan: he won’t be missed, and nor would Jürgen Locadia if only we could get rid of him. We need to keep hold of everyone else. Lewis Dunk’s knee injury might force us to buy, but Leo Östigard is back from Stoke. And do we need a striker? I’m not convinced – I love watching Neal Maupay cause havoc: he has seven goals and we’ve got a great new song for him. Plus Danny Welbeck seems to be fit again. Anyway, I’m sure Tony Bloom will do the right thing and Graham Potter will make it work. • Steph Fincham Burnley We have players out of contract next summer but we really can’t afford to allow any of them to go early given our current position. And in terms of signings, the two problem areas are central midfield and up front. If we could bring in one for each position, that would be progress. But who? Ross Barkley has been linked as a potential loan while Sunderland’s Dan Neil is apparently a target. This window is one we should use for immediate first‑team strengthening, so I wouldn’t question a couple of good loans. • Tony Scholes UpTheClarets.com, @utcdotcom Chelsea Due to injuries and Covid we could do with cover for Chilwell, Alonso and Kanté. Monaco midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni has been linked – he looks extremely promising – while Milan’s Theo Hernández has been mentioned as a potential full-back option. I can’t see much activity beyond that, though. It looks like the club are holding fire on centre‑backs until all the contract issues are resolved. I’d be surprised to see any exits: we definitely have a big squad but we’ve been badly hit by injuries and Covid, so can’t really afford to let anyone go. • Paul Baker in memory of Trizia Fiorellino
Crystal Palace We went big in the summer so I’m not expecting much this month. If Jes Rak-Sakyi continues not to get a first-team chance then I expect he’ll go out on loan and, despite his goal against Norwich, it really hasn’t worked out here for Jean-Philippe Mateta: his loan could be ended early. If that happens then we’ll perhaps look to replace him in the squad with the Real Madrid striker Borja Mayoral, currently on loan at Roma, with whom we have been linked for months, or Arsenal’s Eddie Nketiah. But any major activity is likely to wait until the summer. • Chris Waters @Clapham_Grand Everton We’re still constrained by previous losses, so signings depend on sales. It seems Digne is off after his falling-out with Benítez, which will generate much-needed trading profits. Bringing in Vitaliy Mykolenko, 22, from Dynamo Kyiv to replace the 28-year-old looks like good business. Signing right-back Nathan Patterson from Rangers to replace Séamus Coleman still depends on negotiating phased payments. And with several players in the last six months of their contracts, there’s potential for loans out, and thus loans in. • The Esk TheEsk.org; @TheEsk
Leeds Michaël Cuisance failed a medical. Conor Gallagher preferred Palace. Huddersfield asked too much for Lewis O’Brien. Leeds have been looking for a new midfielder since promotion, but were relaxed about actually finding one. Until now. Now they’re very stressed about it! Or they should be. With more players in the treatment room than points in the league, Marcelo Bielsa and director of football Victor Orta need to get over their queasiness about January shopping. Bielsa is said to like Reading’s John Swift; West Yorkshire’s collective heart rate just needs somebody. As long as they don’t immediately get injured, they’ll do us. • Daniel Chapman thesquareball.net; @MoscowhiteTSB Leicester Main priority: a new set‑piece coach. Honestly, we should spend £50m on it, or whatever it takes … Beyond that, with injuries and Covid ravaging the squad, we face the daunting prospect of having no senior centre-backs or centre-forwards this month. It seemed unthinkable a few weeks ago given the form of Daka, Vardy and Iheanacho but yet another striker may need to be recruited. And at centre-back, the need to spend is just as clear. Tarkowski is always mentioned, but the dirty money on Tyneside will probably talk louder. • Chris Whiting clippings.me/chriswhiting; @ChrisRWhiting Liverpool Up front is one area we should probably be looking at this month – as crazy as that sounds right now. West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen doesn’t score enough goals yet, but at 25 he’s reaching his prime and would only improve with great players around him. Central midfield too. Leicester’s Youri Tielemans continues to be linked with us and would fit right in, as would Leeds’ Raphinha. Though following the defeat at Leicester, it’s obvious we need to dive into the transfer market and buy, buy, buy! • Steph Jones
Manchester City The chances of us signing anyone look close to nil – Pep has confirmed as much. But Ferran Torres leaving concerns me from a numbers perspective, particularly as Mahrez is off to the Africa Cup of Nations. The candidates to come in as a top‑class No 9 remain pretty obvious: Erling Haaland, Harry Kane and Dusan Vlahovic – but will those guys move mid-season? My other concern is the lack of cover for Rodri. Fernandinho is a bona fide club legend but age has finally caught up with him. • Lloyd Scragg ninetythreetwenty.com; @lloyd_scragg Manchester United Where do you start? Persisting with a José-era midfield was a mistake. Last season we should have asked PSG for a Pogba/Verratti swap, but I think that ship has sailed. Declan Rice would be great, but West Ham are in a strong position not to sell. The defence needs sorting again, too. Ezri Konsa at Villa looks promising: Ralf Rangnick has a reputation for developing young players and Konsa looks quality at 24. As for players to sell? Jones, Pogba, Martial and the English lionheart hype job Harry Maguire. • Shaun O’Donnell Newcastle It’s going to be a tough window given our position, but it’s good to see us linked with quality in Jesse Lingard and Kieran Trippier. Most important, there’s no room for mercenaries in our relegation fight: players must be prepared to run through brick walls for the shirt. With Wilson’s injury, two strikers are a priority, as is an experienced centre-half and a commanding midfielder who can grab a game by the scruff of the neck. Peripheral players such as Jeff Hendrick should be moved on – if there are any takers. • David and Richard Holmes Norwich Given our estimated £0 transfer pot, expectations are pretty limited. Sporting director Stuart Webber has made clear we have to sell to buy and, quite frankly, aside from Max Aarons, who’s going to want any of our players? There’s little stomach in the club for the fight to stay up, so this window looks more about getting ready for another crack at the Championship. What we need above all is to give Teemu Pukki some competition, but with our budget that’s nigh on impossible. Happy days at the Carra! • Gary Gowers myfootballwriter.com; @Gary_Gowers; @MFW_NCFC
Southampton I’d be surprised if we’re particularly busy: there generally isn’t a lot of value in January. But with both keepers injured to varying degrees and Willy Caballero on a short-term deal, I imagine we’ll be looking for another. Fraser Forster will go on a free in the summer, but Alex McCarthy signed a new three-year deal recently, so it’ll be interesting to see if we look for a genuine first choice: there’s not really been a great deal between McCarthy and Forster. Sam Johnstone or Dean Henderson would fit the bill. • Steve Grant SaintsWeb.co.uk; @SteveGrant1983 Tottenham Spurs are always linked to dozens of players, but it feels like Milan’s Franck Kessié is a real target, albeit as a pre-contract for the summer. As for Matthijs de Ligt? Dreamy. We’d need oligarch levels of funding, though. I trust in Fabio Paratici’s and Antonio Conte’s current process of reinvention and elimination, with Dele and Winks perhaps able to save themselves. We do need bolstering in midfield if Ndombele can’t adapt or Lo Celso can’t remain fit. And Fiorentina striker Dusan Vlahovic would be the ultimate chef’s kiss. • Spooky dearmrlevy.com; thefightingcock.co.uk; @spooky23
Watford Priorities for recruitment are defensive: we need a left-back and a centre-back. At least one of those also needs to be a leader and an organiser, and both need to be bloody-minded and shouty. John McClelland and Tony Coton achieved this in 1984, Colin Foster and Keith Millen in 1994, so we’re overdue a defensive revolution. As for exits: it’s hard to see anyone going given Covid and that we’ll be losing a significant proportion of our first-teamers to the Africa Cup of Nations – but Ozan Tufan’s loan isn’t really working out for anybody. • Matt Rowson bhappy.wordpress.com; @mattrowson West Ham We desperately need a striker to deputise for Antonio and give him a break late in games. Maybe new part-owner Daniel Kretinsky can help with his Czech contacts. And with Ogbonna and Zouma injured the other urgent need is for a centre-back – James Tarkowski, or maybe Nat Phillips might benefit from regular football. In midfield, re-signing Jesse Lingard would be a coup as Fornals is toiling and Benrahma is away in Africa for January. And if Cresswell is out for any longer, a loan for a left‑back might be necessary. • Pete May Author, Goodbye to Boleyn; hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.uk Wolves We need goals, but that doesn’t necessarily mean strikers. Adding one or two midfielders/defenders with greater mobility could allow us to ditch the back three and have an extra attacker on the pitch. Lille’s Renato Sanches and Sven Botman could fit the bill. Funding those deals could mean offloading Adama Traoré: he’s into the last 18 months of his contract and it doesn’t seem like he’s going to sign a new one. It would be a shame, but if it allows us to create a more fully formed squad, it might be a price worth paying. • Thomas Baugh wolvesblog.com; @wolvesblog";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/premier-league-fans-january-transfer-window-wish-lists
6004;6004;‘I would have bought stock in Zoom!’: experts on wisdom (and regrets) for a new year of Covid;2022-01-02T08:00:12Z;['Kelli María Korducki'];['Life and style', 'Coronavirus', 'US news', 'World news'];If 2020 was a year of fear and isolation, 2021 marked one of return – a road toward something like “normal”, despite so many hairpin turns. The mass distribution of Covid-19 vaccines did not restore the norms of pre-pandemic life, as many had hoped, but it did change the rules of engagement. Time and again, people adapted. As we greet a third calendar year of pandemic life, the Guardian turned to experts across disciplines who have helped the rest of us make sense of the past two years for lessons learned, and wisdom to carry forward. The experts: Jessica Richards is the founder of the trend forecasting firm JMR Trend + Creative. Sydney Mintle is the founder of fashion marketing and public relations firm Gossip & Glamour. Thomas Plante is a professor of psychology at Santa Clara University. Kelly Hills is a bioethicist and co-founder of the bioethics consulting firm Rogue Bioethics. Barbara J Sahakian is a professor of psychiatry at the University of Cambridge. Saskia Popescu is an infectious disease epidemiologist and assistant professor at the George Mason University Schar School of Policy and Government. What was something you realized in 2021 that you wish you’d known, or done, in 2020? Jessica Richards: My biggest piece of advice to my 2020 self would be to stop planning and just do the next right thing. Sydney Mintle: I now wish someone had told me earlier on to savor the quiet moments of reflection instead of panicking about when things would return to normal. The truth is, there is no “normal” any more and we have to remain agile and imaginative. Kelly Hills: I wish I’d taken the time to plan out the ideal accoutrements for a really comfortable and fun movie-watching experience at home – what it would mean for lighting, sound, seats, even things like the best way to make popcorn or how get that mixed-at-the-tap taste for soda. Maybe even a tap or two for beer and hard cider. A way to replicate what we enjoy about going to the movies, but at home. I realized that there are aspects of the theatre experience I really miss. Thomas Plante: I wished that I knew this was going to go on for so long. I would have bought stock in Zoom! What unexpected lesson have you learned from this long and challenging pandemic, and how has it changed your approach to work or life moving forward? Plante: Politicizing the pandemic, rather than treating it as a public health crisis being guided by public health experts, is something I didn’t see coming. I am more skeptical of people’s ability to think and behave logically. My wife (also a psychologist) and I often find ourselves saying that after being licensed psychologists for over 30 years, we still apparently have much to learn about human behavior. Mintle: The pandemic has shown us that we all truly want to be seen and connected. Whether that’s taking place digitally or in real life, what we missed most during the pandemic was human connection and the opportunity to share ideas. During the pandemic, I joined a book club and started reading books by authors of color that have deeply resonated with me. Seeking to understand different points of view will be critical as we work to navigate the changes ahead in 2022. Barbara J Sahakian: I’ve prioritized putting into practice things that I already knew were good for me, but did not always do because of my busy work routine. I now get more outdoor exercise and have a better work-life balance. And as soon as pandemic lockdowns ended in the UK, I made sure to do more of the things I enjoy: going to the opera, ballet and theatre, and visiting restaurants with friends and family. Saskia Popescu: I’ve realized the importance of communication that isn’t fixated on a timeline, and instead takes into account the ebbs and flows of a public health challenge. I realized that ending the pandemic requires continued buy-in from people who are exhausted, who perhaps haven’t been supported as best they should have, or maybe don’t understand the severity of the situation. As a result, I find it important to have more conversations with members of the public to better understand and address specific, existing concerns. I also learned that no matter how much we may think pandemic response should be simple and straightforward, it will be inherently politicized, nuanced, complicated and require the ability to lean into change and work to ensure trust from the public as a critical resource. Richards: As a trend forecaster, it’s my job to think about what life will be like six months, or a year, or even two years from now. When I kick off a new season, I ask myself a series of leading questions to shape the research, including “Where are we going?” During the pandemic, asking myself that question – and, more importantly, asking the follow-up question: “How will I get there?” – helped lay the groundwork for personal goal setting, too. Though the pandemic was and continues to be so large and all-encompassing, the practice of focused steps, leading to the next, and then the next, feels like a way to keep moving forward.;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/wisdom-lessons-regrets-covid-2022
6005;6005;Keir Starmer is making headway, but has he got enough to worry the Tories? | Anne McElvoy;2022-01-02T08:00:12Z;['Anne McElvoy'];['Keir Starmer', 'Labour', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Conservatives', 'Olaf Scholz', 'World news', 'Boris Johnson'];"If champagne socialism did not have such a bad rap, there should be a decent bottle or two open at Keir Starmer’s place this new year weekend. The party has its first consistent lead over the Conservatives: a seven-point advantage of the kind it requires to turn Labour’s doldrums into territory where it could conceivably claw back an election win from the long-running disaster movie. (The opposition was last in power when Eminem was topping the chart.) To his credit, Starmer has held his nerve in a gruelling house clean after the Corbyn era. Yes, there are still strong far left redoubts in Young Labour and the trade union movement, but the leadership has in essence won a battle to rebalance key roles. Indeed, a revivified Team Keir looks like a centrist revival. Rachel Reeves is an assiduous shadow chancellor who can test Rishi Sunak’s pain threshold this year as concerns over cost of living and failings by the government to offset energy price hikes deepen economic anxieties. Lisa Nandy is finally in the right job, taking on Michael Gove’s defence of the red wall seats in the elusive “levelling-up” agenda, and Yvette Cooper back to the big screen as a formidable cross-examiner of Priti Patel in home affairs. With fresh blood to public service briefs in Wes Streeting at health and Bridget Phillipson, as one of the front bench’s breakthrough talents, at education, Starmer is well placed to portray his party as ready to do more than carp at the failings of a stressed government. “More people have more doubts about the Tories,” says a message-bearer. “That gives us the chance to start to talk about the alternative and get a hearing.” A Starmer speech promising “security, prosperity and respect” is also intended to offset the impression of being the concerned-but-miserable party.
Opposition is about opportunity seized and the Tories have handed Labour a generous bunch of year-end disasters. Revelations of vast carelessness in No 10 about the wisdom of holding parties at the outer edge of the Covid rules, to put it generously, to anticipated strong personal criticism of Johnson’s conduct over loans to refurbish his living quarters when (another) report by Lord Geidt emerges in the next week or so remind us of the omni-mess. Add a byelection defeat in Shropshire of epochal proportions and Labour has clearly gained possession of the political ball by dint of government misjudgements. There are, however, some angostura bitters in this mix. Not to put too fine a point on it, Tories do not fear Keir and until they have reason to do so, Labour’s paper gains and more positive polling will remain unconsolidated. Why might this be? Speaking to Starmer advocates in his inner team, the dominant analysis is that Labour has earned the “right to be heard” in recent weeks: an opening in the public mind to arguments that previously seemed irrelevant. Pollsters for both parties conclude that many Johnson assets have turned sour, flipping into incomprehension or distaste. “It’s a bit like looking at the date you thought was incredibly sexy and great fun when you were 16,” observes one Starmerite. “The things that attracted you to them most are the aspects that in a different light can make you really dislike them later.” Yet to torture the metaphor, the electorate has to date someone and simply finding Johnson to be more peroxide than blond will not necessarily do it for his challenger. Starmer is seen as “decent” (not a Johnson asset) and reliable (ditto). The flipside is he can come across as a bit dull. In contrast to the leader he replaced after the Corbyn rout in 2019, there is something wavering in Starmer’s self-presentation that makes it hard for the public to “get” him . The “old” Starmer, a leftish student activist, is happiest empathising with the afflicted and the “crying injustices” of economic inequality. “New” Starmer needs momentum and some sense of va-va-voom. Crucially, the Starmer creed is gaining apostles. Peter Kyle, one of the veterans of the last Labour government re-establishing themselves as forces in the party, put it well in an interview with the Financial Times last week outlining tactical opportunities and the biggest outstanding task: “Our challenge is to light the fire.” In the coming year, which may well be the last before a general election (Brenda from Bristol’s “not another one” horror at early elections is not shared by the government, which is happiest on a war footing), the tactical question Kyle highlights is how broadly Labour should embrace a “progressive alliance” with the Lib Dems in England. Cautiously, would be my advice. Starmer has chosen well so far in terms of keeping out of marshy deal territory with the SNP over the prospect of another referendum in Scotland, not least because that opens a lot of questions that swing English voters would get exercised about. Also, the route to breaking up the union is not promising for Labour. Added to which, a volatile electorate is one to handle with care in trying to steer progressive choices at the ballot box. Standing down in unwinnable seats can have the opposite effect, leaving voters feeling “pre-owned” and surly. (It is also not much fun for candidates running a Potemkin race when resources are being syphoned elsewhere shadow cabinet booster visits are diverted.) So yes to being smart about cooperation when it comes to allocating resources in marginal seats, but the question for tacticians will be how widely this recipe can be applied. Perhaps another reason Conservatives, while rattled at Johnson’s errors, still find it hard to get too worried about Starmer is that he sits at times uneasily between the Blairite legacy and something vaguely to the left of Blair, while eschewing the excesses and economic irrationalities of Corbynism. This is a narrow path to tread and for mere humans outside the sectarian culture of Labour membership such gradations are more puzzling than enlightening. If Starmer is (rightly) channelling competence and pragmatism as core virtues, it muddies the waters when he defines his views on private sector involvement in the NHS by citing his dying mother making him promise his father would not “go private”.
I have no doubt this story is true and deeply felt, but that does not make it a shrewd one to deploy. Emotional stories are strong meat in politics, because they are seen to channel the strongest drives of politicians. It sounded either like a signal of a coming clampdown on private healthcare or a bit of a Dickensian throwback. In truth, large swaths of the NHS are already a public-private mix. The intention was vague and that is always dangerous for an opposition leader seeing to acquire a clearer profile. I doubt that Starmer would, for instance, intervene in the operations of outfits such as Totally Healthcare, which delivers out-of-hospital services (physio, podiatry and the like) and provides logistics to reduce waiting times to NHS trusts with no obvious downside. The popularity of out-of-hours GP services via apps or online services such as Babylon suggests a lot of the public are less than zealous about public-private demarcations. One way or the other, health and social care need core improvements in funding and efficiencies and a re-moralised and better trained and managed workforce. Better to start with the pressing issues than embark on a phoney war. More broadly, Britain’s place in the world should be fertile territory for the opposition. Bluntly, Starmer has a negligible profile abroad. (I am frequently reminded to explain who he is when being interviewed on British politics in Germany.) But centre-left revivals in the US and Germany are also an opportunity to return Labour to the global conversation. The revival of a declined centre-left party after years in the wilderness is encouragement for Starmer, given that Olaf Scholz too started out as a lawyer representing trade unions and has also adopted the “respect” theme to win over voters in depressed heartlands. He has shown that a quiet style, self-discipline and weaving coalitions of interest along with canny strategising can pay dividends. Whether dealing with the Ukraine crisis, the handling of Poland’s challenge to EU pluralist norms or how far to ally with the US under an increasingly inward-looking presidency without Britain’s Nato weight being taken for granted, Labour needs to sound like it can return to the top table of defence and security with public trust – hence the upbeat message to the armed forces and upbeat take on post-Brexit possibilities. The weakest areas for the Starmerism recipe are what it means for industrial strategy, beyond outbidding a likely pouring of Tory largesse into left-behind areas, and the quest for an economic and business strategy that can plausibly claim to cut through a muddle of post-Covid, post-Brexit schemes and sound like a solid prospect for a country that is bruised, but seeking resilience. To Starmer’s credit, he took on the job in awful circumstances and is now clear of the risks of leadership challenge. Labour’s prospects for power are still a work in progress, but are no longer a pipe dream. And if the Tories do not yet fear Starmer, they have started to notice he is around. In the long haul of opposition, that’s a small leap forwards. • Anne McElvoy is senior editor at the Economist";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/keir-starmer-gaining-traction-has-he-got-enough-to-trouble-tories
6006;6006;‘The respect of everyone’: how Ray Illingworth won the Ashes;2022-01-02T08:00:12Z;['Tanya Aldred'];['England cricket team', 'Australia cricket team', 'Australia sport', 'The Ashes', 'Cricket', 'Sport'];"As Joe Root has discovered, an Ashes tour to Australia can unspool as precipitously as a ball of wool bounding down a fire escape. Five England teams have won since Bodyline: Andrew Strauss’s sprinkler squad in 2010-11, Mike Gatting’s 1986-87 “can’t bat, can’t bowl, can’t field” crew, Mike Brearley’s 1978-79 outfit who beat a Packer-weakened Australia, Len Hutton’s 1954-55 side spearheaded by Frank Tyson and the team led by Ray Illingworth, who regained the Ashes in 1970-71. Illingworth, who died on Christmas Eve at the age of 89, was one of England’s shrewdest leaders, tactically brilliant and able to coax brilliance from tricky customers such as Geoff Boycott and John Snow. Ian Chappell, who watched him at work during that series and took over the Australian captaincy in the crucial seventh Test, considers him the best England captain he played against. “I learned a lot from his captaincy,” he says. “Mostly by observation. He handled Snow better than anyone else and, not that Dennis [Lillee] was John Snow, seeing Ray work with John helped me with Dennis.
“There is a lot of bullshit talked about giving players pep talks and so on, but I could see Ray and John had an understanding. When it really mattered, and the battle was elevated, John would perform. “I learned you always had to keep attacking and even when you knew you had to pull back a bit, you still had to let the batsman know you were on him. Ray always had someone in an attacking position and you’d think, what’s going on, I’m doing all right here? That’s not easy to do as captain.” England did not travel without baggage. Illingworth was knocking on the door of 40 and his squad’s average age was 30, dubbed Dad’s Army and the worst side to land on Australian shores before the plane touched down. The side was beset by injuries and there was a divide between the sharp-eyed Illingworth and the tour manager, David Clark, a former Kent amateur captain, a farmer and a supporter of Colin Cowdrey, who had been passed over for the captaincy after injury and never really came to terms with his demotion.
Ken Shuttleworth was on his first tour. The Lancashire fast bowler took five for 47 on Test debut at Brisbane and played in the second Test before tearing an adductor in his thigh during an up-country game in Wagga Wagga. He remembers the tension well. “We had a problem with the manager, Ray was at loggerheads with him all the time. It was a split tour really, between north and south. I think Ray was quoted at the time that he thought Clark was more on Australia’s side than ours. “However, it was a happy touring party. People got on with each other, everyone performed and everyone pulled together, Ray had the respect of everyone. He had a tremendous cricket brain and he always backed his players – whatever he said went.” Shuttleworth roomed with Snow, who was outstanding, finishing with 31 wickets – more than double that of the leading Australian, John Gleeson. “We talked a lot together, he played a lot of Neil Diamond all the time on a little tape recorder – it drove me daft. He had his differences with the manager and it was always John who finished the team meeting off with an awkward question.” It was an exhausting tour for England, with long months away from home – Shuttleworth can still remember the fatigue that came with bowling eight-ball overs in the 100F heat of Perth – and they did not win an lbw decision in the series. They played four-day state games as well as travelling out to the sticks on promotional duties. England pulled ahead with victory in the fourth Test after a series of draws, only to find the organisers had tacked a seventh Test on to the end of the tour to make up for the abandoned Test in Melbourne (which gave way to the first one-day international). This gave Australia a chance to pull even in the contest, as well as the promise of a full match fee, while England’s players were instructed to do it for love. Illingworth was not happy and sent away Clark away “with a flea in his ear” while eventually squeezing a £25 fee per player out of the MCC assistant secretary, Donald Carr. The Test was marred when Terry Jenner ducked into a bouncer from Snow and Illingworth took his players from the field after a section of the crowd started chucking bottles. On the last morning Australia needed another 100 to win with five wickets in hand and Greg Chappell and Rod Marsh at the crease, but they collapsed, giving England a 62-run victory. Illingworth was carried from the field by his delighted team. Chappell remembers a typical Yorkshireman who did not waste words, but whose company he enjoyed over a few beers. “The best way to describe him is as an honest cricketer. He made you fight for his wicket, usually at No 8, and you especially felt that when there was a match on the line.
“He wasn’t an outstanding bowler but you always knew you were in a battle. He had a lot of pride in his own and his team’s performances – one of the things that is most galling about the current England team is that you wonder how much pride there is. There was a lot of fire in Ray’s side – that is what I came to think of as Test cricket.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/the-respect-of-everyone-how-ray-illingworth-won-the-ashes
6007;6007;Commonwealth Games 2022: how Birmingham’s big event is shaping up;2022-01-02T08:00:12Z;['Jessica Murray'];"['Commonwealth Games', 'Sport', 'Birmingham', ""Women's cricket"", 'Netball']";"With more than one million tickets sold, a host of star athletes signed up, more than 41,000 volunteer applications received and dozens of sold out events, anticipation for the Commonwealth Games in July is high. The games in Birmingham will be the first major international multisport event with spectators since the start of the pandemic, meaning the pressure is on to get it right, but the feeling of excitement is palpable.
“This is the biggest thing that’s going to happen in the UK so people want to get involved,” says Ian Reid, the event’s chief executive. “Considering we started asking people to buy tickets about a year out and with all the uncertainty around Covid, and now we’re sat here having sold over one million tickets, it gives us real comfort that we’re going to have pretty much full stadiums at the vast majority of our events. The city’s going to be really jumping.” Layla Guscoth, who plays netball for England, is one of many athletes who believe the absence of crowds has been a major loss for sporting events since Covid. “The past couple of years have been a bit of a car crash for international sport in terms of restrictions and travelling,” she says. “It’s so exciting to think about having a major championship in England, with spectators, fingers crossed. Hopefully, for a couple of weeks, it can just enthral us all.” The Omicron variant and its implication for international travel and large-scale events has naturally caused organisers some concern, particularly after a period when it seemed the worst of the pandemic was over. “We have invested a huge amount of time, resources and money planning for various Covid scenarios,” says Reid.
Welcoming people from abroad is likely to be one of the biggest worries, but organisers are expecting at least 90% of spectators to be from the UK. “There are now safety precautions like [vaccine] passports we can put in place and there’s clearly an advantage of the event taking place in summer. Everyone’s very confident that visitors will be coming to Birmingham, and we will put on a full sport programme with full stadiums,” Reid says. Despite the challenges of organising the event in constantly changing circumstances, the team is aiming for the biggest Commonwealth Games, with 286 sessions of sport in the two-week event. It will also be the first time a multisport event has more medal events for women than men (the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in 2018 had an equal number). It will feature women’s cricket for the first time and T20 cricket makes it debut. “The growth of women’s cricket around the Commonwealth has been incredible,” says Reid. “The International Cricket Council is right behind us, they see this as the biggest event for women’s cricket ever. We’re hoping to put that sport right in the spotlight, and cricket is a Commonwealth sport so the quality will be really high.” The games will also feature more para sports than before and unlike at the Olympics will be fully integrated into the main timetable. Reid says: “We treat every athlete competing in our games exactly the same, they’re on exactly the same stage. We don’t look at it as a para programme and an able-bodied programme, we look at it as a single event. “The great thing about that is we introduce huge numbers of people to elite para sport that perhaps they have not engaged with before, because you may watch an able-bodied 100m race followed by a wheelchair race.”
It is being hailed as Birmingham’s big opportunity to showcase itself on the world stage, and building work is increasing rapidly. Alexander Stadium in Perry Barr, which will host the athletics as well as the opening and closing ceremonies, is having a £72m revamp to increase capacity to about 30,000. Sandwell Aquatics Centre is the only venue being built for the games, hosting 11 days of swimming, para swimming and diving, and is due to be completed in the spring. Guscoth, who is from Birmingham, says she is looking forward to the often underrated city welcoming so many visitors. “Birmingham gets put down all the time but it has so much to offer – it’s so vibrant, it’s so multicultural, there’s a huge amount to do,” she says. “I’m pleased the athletics stadium has been rebuilt and other things are popping up around the city which I hope will continue to encourage young people to get involved in sports.” Birmingham has the youngest population of any city in Europe, with under-25s accounting for nearly 40% of its residents, and Reid believes the games will make a real effort to engage with its youthful audience. The city centre Smithfield site will host beach volleyball and, in a first for the Commonwealth Games, 3x3 basketball. “Rather than the traditional 5x5 basketball, 3x3 basketball uses a single net,” says Reid. “It’s a bit more urban, it’s really fast and it’s a really engaging sport, and the fact it’s sold out so quickly shows there’s a huge appetite for it. “There will also be DJs and music performances on that site, much more of a party atmosphere.”
Guscoth said the opportunity to inspire young people after two years of Covid is one of the main things she is excited to see. “I’d hate to think how many kids over the last two years have dropped out of sports, because it’s not been there to be played,” she said. “It’s really tough to maintain interest and to keep up with fitness when gyms have been shut and clubs and school sports have been stopped, so hopefully this will reinvest a bit of energy and enthusiasm in sports. “For me, it’s seeing the faces of young women in the crowd and people that I know look up to us as role models. It’s nice to know that the next generation are going to be able to witness that again.”
Organisers said ticket sales were given a big boost by the Olympics last summer, which coincided with the launch of the first ticket ballot. A number of athletes who competed in Tokyo, including swimmer Adam Peaty, sprinter Dina Asher-Smith, middle-distance runner Laura Muir and the para sport athlete Kadeena Cox, have signed up to compete. “We’ve undoubtedly been helped by the Tokyo Olympics. People have been watching those athletes compete and then want to watch them in person at a home games,” says Reid. “We just want to put on a really incredible celebration and feel like we’re getting back to, hopefully, some degree of normality.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/commonwealth-games-2022-how-birminghams-big-event-is-shaping-up
6008;6008;After rightwing attacks on rescues, UK lifeboat charity has record fundraising year;2022-01-02T08:00:12Z;['Mark Townsend'];['Immigration and asylum', 'UK news', 'Charities', 'Voluntary sector', 'Society', 'Refugees', 'Nigel Farage', 'Priti Patel', 'Politics', 'The far right', 'Far right', 'Water transport'];"The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is on course for the highest annual fundraising total in its near 200-year history. Donations swelled after the charity attracted huge public support following rightwing attacks for helping save the lives of asylum seekers at risk of drowning in the Channel. The RNLI said it has received a significant increase in support, with online donations rising by 50% this year. Founded in 1824, the UK’s network of volunteer lifeboats has been inundated with donations and messages of support after high-profile attacks from individuals such as Nigel Farage and elements of the media, who have called the charity “woke” for fulfilling its humanitarian mission to save lives at sea. Their claims are believed to have encouraged a group of fishermen who in November allegedly attempted to block a lifeboat from going to the Channel to rescue asylum seekers, days before 27 people drowned in the Channel.
Jayne George, the RNLI’s fundraising director, said that such hostility appeared to have had the opposite effect to what its architects would have wanted. “We’ve had a better response to almost everything that we’ve done in 2021. At the end of the year, we’re going to have more members, we’re going to have more cash donors and more people who give to us via direct debit,” she said.George added that the charity’s database of supporters had also grown appreciably, with the organisation now in regular contact with 300,000 people. Channel crossings have become one of the most politicised issues in British politics, with the home secretary, Priti Patel, staking her reputation on making the route “unviable” yet unable to prevent almost 28,000 people arriving in small boats in 2021, compared with just over 8,400 the previous year. Her controversial borders bill intends to reduce such numbers and contained, until recently, proposals that appeared to criminalise organisations such as the RNLI for rescuing asylum seekers in the Channel. “We can’t help but notice that it’s a really divisive issue that’s in the news almost daily. Whatever the negatives, the positive is that it brings out this significant reaction in terms of people wanting to support us, particularly our work in the eastern Channel,” said George. She added that the boom in staycations during the pandemic meant more people were exposed to its work than usual: 2020 was one of the charity’s busiest on record, with 8,239 lifeboat launches that assisted 8,374 people and saved 239 lives. The organisation has also noted that support is not just confined to coastal areas. “In fact the majority of our most successful cohorts of fundraisers are in the major cities. We’ve got a Leeds business branch that is really successful and two committees in London that have raised significant sums of money, and also Birmingham as well,” said George. Sunday is the 20th anniversary of lifeboats on the Thames, where they were introduced after the 1989 Marchioness pleasure boat disaster in which 51 people died. Despite repeated assertions from the Home Office that it is heavily targeting small boat crossings, a parliamentary report last month said the government’s operations in the Channel “rely heavily on voluntary organisations, such as the RNLI, or independent lifeboats”. George said: “Our core purpose is humanitarian – we exist to save everyone.”";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/02/rightwing-attacks-rescues-uk-lifeboat-charity-fundraising-rnli-royal-national-lifeboat-institution
6009;6009;Food for the future: helping farmers in Kenya adapt to the climate crisis;2022-01-02T07:45:11Z;['Peter Muiruri'];['Kenya', 'Climate crisis', 'Africa', 'Environment', 'Society', 'World news', 'Farming'];The harsh midday sun beats down on the withering pawpaw plants in Maureen Adhiambo’s patch of land. The villagers in Kamenya have not seen rain for months, and when it does come, the soil is too dry and loose to retain any of the moisture or nutrients. Last year Adhiambo saw her maize dry up long before it could mature. Like many farmers in the Homa Bay region, on the south bank of Kenya’s Lake Victoria, she is staring at yet another cycle of crop failure. “Farming has been frustrating for us,” says Adhiambo, in the shade of a thirsty-looking banana plant. “Look at my neighbours’ farms. They too will harvest very little, if any. Changing weather patterns and poor soils have made it difficult to make a decent living out of farming.” To support her family, the mother of three had moved to the neighbouring county of Migori in 2016 for a job selling life insurance. But that did not fare well and she went home a year later to take another shot at farming. She planted beans, onions and other vegetables in the hope that the rains due from March to May would arrive on time, but they did not. She tried again in October but the short rainy season failed too. She also lost her 13,000 Kenyan shillings (£84) investment. Frustrated, she decided to try her hand at poultry keeping. About 10km from Adhiambo’s home, in Seka village, 35-year-old Dominic Owuor tends a healthy crop of kale while on a nearby piece of land, tomato plants are thriving. His seven acres, leased from his neighbours, contrast sharply with Adhiambo’s. Here, the soils have a heavier water and nutrient retention ratio, thanks to water that Owuor pumps from Lake Victoria. However, he hasn’t had an easy time switching from paid employment to farming either. After graduating, Owuor took up teaching but he left in 2013 to work in the financial sector before going into full-time farming in 2018. “I tried my hand at farming while still employed, hoping to contribute to food security and provide employment to young people. But I knew little about agribusiness and the kind of plants that can withstand deteriorating weather patterns. I also employed casual labourers who weren’t well versed in farming either. Out of my initial investment of 100,000 Kenyan shillings, I barely managed half of that in returns,” he says. Farming around Lake Victoria is a hit and miss affair. They have seen the impact of a changing climate as the lake’s water level has risen and swallowed hundreds of acres of land. For those on higher ground, prolonged droughts have killed off young crops. The erratic climate and poor knowledge of viable agricultural practices have devastated food security and economic prospects for people who relied on fishing. According to the World Bank Group climate change action plan 2016-2020, the world will need to produce 50% more food by 2050 but estimates that with current practices, there will be a 40% water shortfall between demand and available supply. “Climate-smart land use, applied across the agricultural, forestry, fisheries, and conservation sectors, can increase food production and farmers’ income while offering large opportunities for climate resilience,” says its report. Adapting to the vagaries of an adverse climate is a steep learning curve for small-scale farmers. Adhiambo and Owuor benefited from training offered by UK organisation Practical Action, which assists smallholders to make a living while protecting their environment. Since Owuor switched from maize crops to horticulture, his revenues have grown to 250,000 shillings a month. “Even after deducting labour, farm inputs and marketing costs, I am happy with what I get. Irrigation-fed horticulture puts money in your pocket all year round unlike food crops that depend on an uncertain weather pattern,” he says. Adhiambo took up poultry farming with 17 chicks. Two years ago, she and her husband attended Practical Action-sponsored training to learn about poultry disease management, vaccination and housing. They also learned how to feed red worms with organic waste that are a rich source of protein for the birds. “I knew nothing about poultry when I started but since the training I have multiplied the birds and increased my earnings. I’m also taking eggs to the hatchery for more stock. Poultry works better for me than crop farming,” says Adhiambo. Jim Ouko, the youth and livelihood adviser at Practical Action, says changing rain patterns, high irrigation costs, new pests and diseases have all lowered food production while flash floods have destroyed crops and displaced farmers. “Prolonged droughts or severe flooding contribute to high costs of available food items. Farmers need to adopt climate-resilient farming practices … while cultivating pest-resistant African leafy vegetables.” Like Adhiambo, Merceline Akinyi, a mother of two from Nyakach, Kisumu, also got frustrated after losing maize crops. She learned how to rotate her crops to keep pests at bay and now her land is divided into paddocks where she grows vegetables using water from shallow wells within her compound. “I decided I will no longer wait for the rains,” says Akinyi. “Before 2010, I used to plant food crops and get nothing due to poor rains. I remember spending 7,000 shillings to prepare and plant in my one-acre farm and getting not more than 5,000 shillings in return, a financial loss and reduced food security. With water nearby, I can grow vegetables all year round. People in my area are not food-secure and come to my home to learn about modern ways of farming,” she says. The training has also attracted young people who previously had no interest in growing food. At a farm next to Owuor’s, 29-year-old Dedan Odhiambo is sorting out freshly-picked tomatoes. He is also a teacher who took up farming after failing to find a job. “I learned farming under Owuor’s wings,” he says. “He encouraged me to lease an acre of land and helped me identify a hybrid tomato variety that is bacteria and wilt-resistant. You can see the results.” As the Food and Agriculture Organization warns that 690 million people are facing hunger, the farmers of Lake Victoria are working to buck the trend with climate-smart agriculture – one acre at a time.;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/02/food-for-the-future-helping-farmers-in-kenya-adapt-to-the-climate-crisis
6010;6010;We talk a lot about freedom – but not enough about whose freedom is at stake | Kenan Malik;2022-01-02T07:30:11Z;['Kenan Malik'];['Inequality', 'History books', 'Race', 'Class issues'];"‘For me, history is the record not only of how things change, but how people make things change, how they act individually and collectively to create a better world.” So wrote American historian Tyler Stovall about his approach to his craft. The echoes of historians such as EP Thompson and Eric Foner, Barbara Fields and Robin DG Kelley are unmistakable in his work. Primarily a historian of France, Stovall’s work bears on many important present-day themes – the relationship between race and class, the tension between universalism and particularism, the contradictions of liberalism. Yet few people outside academia know of him and his death last month was almost unmarked in the mainstream media, a testament, perhaps, to the parochialism of our culture. Engaging with his work is a useful means of illuminating many contemporary debates. Stovall’s early research in the 1980s looked at the making of working-class communities, especially in the “red belt” around Paris. Increasingly, though, his attention became drawn to some of the blind spots of French historiography, notably issues of race and imperialism. His studies of French colonialism and of colonial labour in France helped to challenge the idea of a colour-blind nation, not mired by the racism that beset the Anglo-Saxon world, and to unpick the ways in which the traditions of French universalism could be wielded to deny rights and dignity to those deemed not to belong. Stovell’s final book, White Freedom, published last year, was in some ways the culmination of his life’s endeavour. Yet it is also as frustrating as it is enlightening, revealing both the significance of his work and also the confusions that infest contemporary thinking about race. Modern ideas of freedom and liberty, Stovall observes, emerged alongside theories of race. While liberty and racism are usually seen as opposing claims, they are, in fact, he insists, inextricably linked, because ideals of freedom and liberty assumed the exclusion of non-whites. As such, they bear “the unmistakable stamp of whiteness and white racial ideology”. Unquestionably, many thinkers who helped to shape modern ideas of freedom and liberty held racist views and supported exclusionary practices. John Locke, often regarded as the founding philosopher of liberalism, defended slavery and owned shares in a slave-trading company. Immanuel Kant, the towering Enlightenment figure, believed that “humanity is at its greatest perfection in the race of whites”. The French revolutionaries who proclaimed the Declaration of the Rights of Man denied those same rights to slaves until forced to do so by an insurrection in the colony of Saint Domingue. Abraham Lincoln launched the civil war that ended slavery in America but insisted also that he was not “in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races”.
For all this, Stovall’s own work shows that the struggle over the meaning of freedom was more complex than can be captured by a notion such as “white freedom”. The demand that certain groups be excluded from the benefits of freedom was provoked primarily not by racial concerns, but by political needs, especially by fears of social disorder. Throughout the 19th century, Stovall points out, France was torn between “the radical vision of democracy championed by… the sans-culottes of the French Revolution” and the liberal desire to “not endanger private property”. This struggle sparked the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 and the 1871 Paris Commune. The crushing of these revolutionary challenges led to the institutionalisation of more restricted notions of freedom. The tension Stovall describes here goes back to the 17th century and forward to the 20th. In the famous Putney debates during the English civil war, Oliver Cromwell’s son-in-law Henry Ireton spoke for the officer class in insisting that “Liberty cannot be provided for in a general sense if property be preserved”. A century later, this question was at the heart of the struggle between the radicals and the moderates of the Enlightenment. In the 19th century, the liberal imperialist Thomas Macaulay argued, in response to Chartist demands for democracy, that “universal suffrage… is incompatible with property” and hence “with civilisation”. The notion of race provided a means of casting inequalities as natural and inevitable. This became the justification for enslavement, for the brutal treatment of colonial subjects and for the denial of rights to non-white peoples in Europe and America. It was also the justification for suppressing working-class rights. In the 19th century, as Stovall acknowledges, the working class was viewed as a distinct and inferior race. The French Christian socialist Philippe Buchez wondered how “within a population such as ours, races may form, so miserable, inferior and bastardised that they may be classed as below the most inferior savage races, for their inferiority is sometimes beyond cure?” He was talking not of Africans or Asians but of the working class and the rural poor of France. Racial divisions became also a means of dismantling challenges to the ruling order by persuading white workers that their interests lay in their “whiteness”, not in their status as workers. In the American south, for instance, “Jim Crow” laws, which imposed apartheid-style segregation, were mainly enforced at the turn of the 20th century in response to the “Fusion” movements, which brought together black workers and poor white farmers, to challenge the established order and, in North Carolina, win power. The Democrats, the ousted ruling party, launched a violent “white supremacy campaign” to rupture the coalition, win white working-class support for treating blacks as outcasts and regain political control. This complex relationship between liberties, race, class and whiteness is ill-served by a concept such as “white freedom”. Nor is this just an issue about history. “Whiteness” has become an idea fetishised today both by racists and by many anti-racists, the one claiming that all white people have a common set of interests, the other reframing racism as “white privilege”. In doing so, both, in different ways, obscure the political and structural reasons for racism, on the one hand, and the social problems facing the working class, on the other, making it more difficult to challenge either. Tyler Stovall’s work is important in illuminating previously ignored areas of class, race and colonialism and should be better known and cherished. It should also be challenged and questioned, especially the arguments about “white freedom”. Intellectual legacies, like freedoms, are always contested. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/race-class-freedom-liberty-and-work-of-historian-tyler-stovall
6011;6011;Retrieved after decades: the painting supposedly ‘bought’ by the Nazis;2022-01-02T07:15:11Z;['Vanessa Thorpe'];['Art theft', 'Nazism', 'Art', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'World news', 'Germany', 'Europe', 'France'];"Fresh proof that the Nazis set up fake auctions and phoney paperwork to disguise their looting of art and valuable possessions has been uncovered by an amateur sleuth researching her own family mystery. French writer Pauline Baer de Perignon’s investigation has revealed the fate of a missing collection of art that included work by Monet, Renoir and Degas and also exposed the reluctance of Europe’s leading museums to accept evidence of the deceit. Baer was prompted to look into the past when she bumped into an English cousin who told her he believed the family had been “robbed”. “The whole thing has changed my life,” said Baer this weekend. “I have had to look back at a long-forgotten family story as well as at the hidden secrets of the Gestapo. And then I had to confront the truth about paintings held by galleries such as the Louvre and the state museum in Dresden. I was so naive when I started.” Baer’s three years of research have led not just to a better understanding of the way in which significant works of art were systematically stolen after Germany invaded France, but will culminate later this month in the high-profile sale of a recovered painting at Sotheby’s in New York.
Portrait of a Lady as Pomona, by the revered 18th-century French artist Nicolas de Largillière, once belonged to her great-grandfather, the Parisian collector Jules Strauss, and was only returned to his descendants last year. It is now expected to sell for $1m-$1.5m (£750,000-£1.1m). “I could have asked my father to tell me about Jules Strauss, but I never did,” Baer has explained. “My father died when I was 20, before I was bold enough to ask him about the war, about his parents and grandparents, about his emotions and his memories.” Baer’s curiosity was aroused when she bumped into her cousin Andrew Strauss at a concert in Paris eight years ago. The two had not met since she was a teenager, but he told her that he worked at Sotheby’s and believed the apparent sale of the Strauss collection in the early 1940s was “shady”. He mentioned the involvement of dummy companies, Nazi officers and museum inventories to his bemused cousin. “Andrew’s words sent my mind tumbling down a rabbit hole,” said Baer. Armed with a scribbled note listing the names of famous artists, Baer began to piece together the lost past. She was now as interested in finding out what happened to her distant family members as in the fate of the missing art. A book about her efforts, The Vanished Collection, has already made waves in France, where it was published last year and where critics have compared it to a compelling suspense novel. A reviewer for Elle said it was as “devourable as a thriller”, while others have compared the family’s story to those of other famous Jewish families whose art was looted in the war, such as the Camondos, the Rothschilds and the Ephrussis. At the start of Baer’s inquiries, all she had was one photograph of Strauss, her illustrious great-grandfather, and another of the many portraits hanging on the walls of his former home on Avenue Foch in Paris. She knew the apartment had gone, but that there was one elderly living relative with first-hand knowledge of what had happened. She delved into the archives of great museums and asked difficult questions of the French ministry of culture. She was surprised to discover how the thefts had been covered up, but her English translator, Natasha Lehrer, believes the most powerful part of the book concerns howmodern art institutions have dragged their feet and, at worst, avoided doubts about the ownership of important paintings.
“What Pauline stumbled upon was an apparent unwillingness among those leading various large state museums to admit that they were holding looted works of art until very recently,” said Lehrer. “This despite the fact that families and collectors often had all the provenance information available to identify them as the rightful owners. There has been a notable reluctance to return artworks.” The English version of Baer’s book is to be published next month by Head of Zeus. Baer tracked down the portrait by Largillière to Dresden’s state art collections and found archival evidence to prove that Strauss had been forced to sell it. The masterpiece had apparently been acquired in 1941 for the Reichsbank in Berlin and then transferred to the ministry of finance, before going to Dresden in 1959. Baer found the words “Collection Jules Strauss” next to the Largillière’s listing in the German Lost Art Foundation, but was then told that the Dresden museum’s director was not minded to return it. She was questioned about whether Strauss was originally happy to sell, despite evidence of laws that prevented Jews from profiting by such deals. “The more I continued with my investigation, the more I realised how unlikely it was that Jules had been able to avoid his collection becoming seized by the Nazis,” said Baer. “Even before the invasion of France, the Germans had compiled a list of large French collections.”
Dresden’s state art collections has since said: “The investigation of this complex case was as extensive and thorough as is necessary to ensure that a work of art is returned to its rightful owner.” The portrait’s sale in New York this month will now allow all 20 of Strauss’s heirs a share in its value. Painted between 1710 and 1714, when Largillière was at the height of his powers, the sitter for the portrait is thought to be Marie Madeleine de La Vieuville, the Marquise de Parabère, mistress of Philippe II, Duc d’Orléans. She is depicted as Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit and abundance. Strauss, a Frankfurt-born banker, built an extraordinary collection of art, ranging from antiques to the Impressionists, while he was in Paris. It is now clear that much of it was then stolen or forcibly sold by the Nazis.";https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/02/retrieved-after-decades-the-painting-supposedly-bought-by-the-nazis
6012;6012;Ghislaine Maxwell, the Demon Queen, is behind bars. Does she have a secret that could unlock her shackles?;2022-01-02T07:15:11Z;['John Sweeney'];['Ghislaine Maxwell', 'US news', 'World news', 'Jeffrey Epstein', 'Sex trafficking', 'Society', 'US crime', 'Rape and sexual assault'];"Guilty, five times over, Ghislaine Maxwell, shackled, sits in the sweat box as it crawls over Brooklyn Bridge along with the rest of the rush-hour little people she used to fly over, saying a last goodbye to the Imperial City’s billion-dollar stalagmites. The one-time Princess Mwah-Mwah is now the Demon Queen, facing 30 years, the rest of her life in prison, not some Disneyland of rightwing fantasy but a bone pit of the bad, the mad and the broken locked up until the end of age. She has a secret key that could unlock her shackles. What if she sings, tells the feds what she knows, gives up the overmighty men who, along with her one-time lover Jeffrey Epstein, abused women more child than adult back in her pomp? She could cut her jail time down to 10 years and be out in seven, thanks to good behaviour. But to do that, Maxwell – once the bosom pal of the second son of the Queen of England, two US presidents, and our prime minister, Boris Johnson, on the word of his sister, Rachel – would have to admit that she had been Epstein’s $30m pimp, that she treated a host of underage women as nothings, trash, that she did great wrong, that she was sorry. No sign of that. I do feel pity for Maxwell, for the dark chasm between how her life was and the wretched place she is in now but her lack of remorse, her failure to address reality, her unwillingness to express a smidgen of regret to her victims hardens the heart. And therein lies her tragedy, the darkest fairytale of modern times. Her first chance at coming clean was in 2002 when reporter Vicky Ward was checking out claims by Annie Farmer, who said that in 1996, when she was 16, she was flown to Epstein’s Zorro ranch in New Mexico where, her story goes, she was sexually abused by Maxwell and Epstein. She tricked Farmer, giving the teenager a massage. It became sexual, then Farmer realised the door was open, her fear being that Epstein was standing in the dark, watching.
Later, Epstein came into Farmer’s bed but she resisted, then fled. To Ward, Maxwell said: “I can guarantee that I didn’t give her a massage… Why do you say this? Some kid who just says she came to the ranch that I gave a massage to… It’s wrong. OK? It is wrong! I don’t like the implication of what you’re saying either, for the record. At all. I don’t like it at all. Disgusting.” That story never ran until far too late. Ward, by the way, went on to blog in 2011 that she admired Epstein and: “I like Ghislaine, everyone does.” No one at all who knew Maxwell back in the day comes out of this story well. Maxwell’s second chance to set evil to rights was in October 2005 when the Palm Beach police department raided Epstein’s house on El Brillo Way. The socialite who got a countess to write a 50-page manual on such things as how full a box of tissues had to be before it was thrown away – half – never noticed the fresh child factory production line of underage girls coming and going. But she would have registered the fact of the police raid, surely? Would, perhaps, have wondered what had happened to all the house’s computer hard drives, including, one would think, her own, when they were mysteriously removed before the raid, as if a bent copper in on the police investigation had forewarned Team Epstein? Nothing from Maxwell then. Not a word in 2007 when she got her final dollop of Epstein’s $30m, a single $7m transfer for a helicopter to be owned by her own company. Silence in 2008 when her ex Epstein was convicted of procuring an underage girl for prostitution, effectively that he was a paedophile. She was still taking his money in 2009, by her own account. In 2016 she swore on oath, in a civil suit brought by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, that there had been no underage sex, nothing to see here, folks. She was still watching the paedophile’s back. Silence, too, in 2019 when Epstein was arrested a second time in July and in August when he killed himself in jail. Instead of facing the music, Maxwell ran, only to be caught and tried. She could have told the jury that she was innocent, that the four women who said they had been abused were making it up, as were their three boyfriends, as was the butler, Juan Alessi, as was the chain of photographs showing an intimacy from the early 90s, as was the chain of money transfers proving that Epstein paid her $30m over eight years for being a fancy janitor. Instead, she held her tongue, only telling the judge: “The government has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. So there is no need for me to testify.”
Her bark of arrogant command echoed her father, Robert Maxwell, the first monster in her life, a man who stole £400m from his pensioners, who took pride in pissing off the roof of his helicopter pad in the heart of London, who evacuated his bowels within earshot of reporters, who used to wipe his bottom with cloth towels and let the maids pick them up. Her pattern of denial over two decades suggests that his daughter will find it impossible to do a plea bargain with the feds and so her future looks impossibly bleak. And that can only be down to her – and the rest of the Maxwell family. Questioned about the evidence against her on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, her brother Ian Maxwell said that conditions in her remand prison were grim. We all agree. But Maxwell in court looked fantastic, as if she had stepped off a yacht. Brothers Ian and Kevin both hit their stride, proclaiming their sister’s innocence, Kevin saying “she is not the Demon Queen”. One can only ask why did Epstein pay her $30m? The prosecution case was, simply put, that no 16-year-old girl would fly to the middle of nowhere in New Mexico to spend a weekend with Epstein but if her mother were told that Maxwell was going to be there, then you might. The same goes for the other three victims: Jane and Kate and Carolyn. Maxwell got her $30m and in return she provided cover for the paedophile. I sat through the evidence and came to the conclusion that she was as guilty as sin. So did the other reporters. So did the jury. That said, it makes one deeply uneasy that while Maxwell is facing a long, slow, grey death inside, the alpha males in our dark fairytale are walking free. The presidents, the prince, the famous Harvard lawyer, the Wall Street masters of the universe, the scientists with brains the size of planets, hobnobbed with Epstein and Maxwell, many on the Lolita Express, some on Paedo Island in the US Virgin Islands. They all deny doing or seeing anything untoward. True, none of the under-age women say they were sexually abused by Trump and Clinton. Harvard lawyer Alan Dershowitz vehemently denies wrongdoing but he has questions to answer. His primary accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, stands by her story that she was required to have sex with him on multiple occasions. She also accuses Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, saying she was forced to have sex with him three times in 2001 and there is a photograph that shows they met. For the moment, Andrew Windsor denies all, as convincingly as a gimp photographed in a gimp suit denying he’s a gimp. Virginia’s lawyers are asking him to prove that she was wrong to say that he was a sweaty dancer because he can’t sweat. My friend Ashley Grossman, professor of neuro-endocrinology at Oxford, thinks the prince’s claim nonsense. Virginia was 17 when she was trafficked from Florida to London.

6013;6013;The big picture: last call for Commonwealth arrivals, 1962;2022-01-02T07:00:12Z;['Tim Adams'];['Photography', 'Immigration and asylum', 'Windrush scandal'];"This picture of a young couple arriving at Gatwick airport from the Caribbean on 30 June 1962 was taken on the evening before the Commonwealth Immigrants Act came into force. The act had been passed by Harold Macmillan’s Conservative government to halt the flow of citizens from current and former British colonies. It was designed in particular to bring to an abrupt end the “open door” welcome for people from the West Indies – characterised by the arrival of the Empire Windrush in 1948 – to help rebuild the so-called “mother country” after the war. Macmillan had been under pressure from his militant backbenchers, some in the newly formed far-right Monday Club, to introduce the bill. Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell called it “cruel and brutal anti-colour legislation”. The couple in the picture, striding confidently across the tarmac from their BOAC plane in their Sunday clothes, therefore represent perhaps the last moment that Commonwealth citizens from the Caribbean arrived in Britain with unclouded hope. In the subsequent decade, two further immigration bills tightened the legislation against the free movement of families, and the subject became an emotive and divisive political issue right up to the present moment, with the draconian nationality and borders bill passing through parliament.
This photograph is included in an exhibition, Changing the Story, that uses pictures from the TopFoto archive to challenge received ideas of the “whiteness” of Britain after the first world war. The exhibition, brought to life by poet and performer Rommi Smith, includes images from between 1917 and 1962 that question the monocultural stereotypes of nation that conservative forces promoted. “I open the album and am spellbound,” Smith writes of encountering this archive. “I am immediately struck that what unites these stories of people and places across time and space is the racial diversity of the protagonists in them. These photos flip the script on Britishness: my history lessons did not look like this.” Changing the Story: Photographs of British Life in Black and White, 1917-1962 is at the North Wall Arts Centre, Oxford, 10-29 January";https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/02/the-big-picture-last-call-for-commonwealth-arrivals-1962
6014;6014;The Steal review: stethoscope for a democracy close to cardiac arrest;2022-01-02T07:00:12Z;['Charles Kaiser'];['Books', 'US elections 2020', 'US politics', 'US news', 'US domestic policy', 'US political financing', 'Donald Trump', 'Trump administration', 'Republicans', 'World news', 'Culture', 'Politics books'];"In their terrific new book, the veteran reporters Mark Bowden and Matthew Teague argue that the mob that invaded the Capitol in Washington almost exactly a year ago “had no more chance of overthrowing the US government than hippies in 1967 had trying to levitate the Pentagon”.
The “real insurrection” was the one “led by Trump and his coterie of sycophants” in Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona. It “was only slightly better organized than the mob but considerably more calculated and dangerous”. That real insurrection is the subject of this timely and important volume. The authors have used a stethoscope to examine the minutia of the American election process. The result is a thrilling and suspenseful celebration of the survival of democracy. The attempted coup was led by Donald Trump. Its intended denouement, in which the vice-president, Mike Pence, would ignore the votes of the six states above plus Washington DC in order to swing the election to Trump, was outlined in an insane memo written by the lawyer John Eastman, described here as “surely the most seditious document to emerge from the White House in American history”. That final act, of course, never happened. Not even Pence, the most sycophantic vice-president of modern times, could bring himself to violate the constitution so blatantly to keep his boss in the White House. But the genuine heroes, brought to life here, were the “hundreds of obscure Americans from every walk of life, state and local officials, judges and election workers. Many of them were Republicans, some were Trump supporters. They refused to accept his slander of themselves, their communities and their workers, and they refused to betray their sworn duty to their office and their country. They were the real patriots.”
Bowden and Teague – the latter a Guardian contributor – take us through six battles that lasted from the night of the election, 3 November 2020, until Joe Biden’s election was finally certified by Congress early on 7 January last year. Their book performs a vital service, demonstrating just how well our tattered democracy managed to function despite vicious partisanship and all the new challenges created by the pandemic. For the first time, I understood how brilliantly new machines used to count the votes performed, the intricacies of opening outer and inner envelopes, capturing the images of both then preserving the vital paper ballots inside, making it possible to confirm electronic results with a hand count in case of any failure in technology. In Arizona, the elections department conducted “the mandatory hand count of election day ballots from 2% of the vote centers and 1% of the early ballots as required by Arizona law and it yielded a 100% match to the results produced by the tabulation equipment”. Scott Jarrett was co-director of elections in the populous Maricopa county, and he is one of the crucial bureaucrats celebrated here: “A pale slender young man … dressed in a plain gray suit, the very picture of an earnest functionary, a man happily engaged in the actual machinery of government and quietly proud of his own unheralded importance and competence.” In a public hearing crowded with crazed conspiracy theorists, Jarrett carefully explained how only one of the two “encrypted memory cards (both with tamper-proof evidence seals)” was transported from various polling centers to the main counting location, “so that the results on one card could be double-checked against the other as well as the precinct ballot report they had generated. Backing up that memory were, of course, the actual ballots that had been run through the machines. The memory cards and the ballots were sealed and delivered by “two members of different parties”, escorted by county sheriffs. Clint Hickman, chairman of the Maricopa county board of supervisors, noted that if the eyes of some in the audience were glazing over, he just wanted “people that are watching this” to understand “we don’t glaze over”. The authors point out that Hickman was touching on a fundamental feature of The Steal, the factitious narrative concocted by Trump and his cronies: conspiracy theorists depend on ignorance. “They begin with distrust: only a sucker believes the official story. They then replace the often tedious, mundane details of an intricate process … with a simpler narrative”: theft.
They invent colorful stories about a “deal struck with a late Venezuelan dictator to deliver tainted election machines, or a plot to preprint fake ballots in the dead of night”. This creates what cognitive scientists call “a community of knowledge”. The big problem that didn’t exist even 30 years ago is the speed with which such idiotic stories are spread through the internet and by the Twitter feed of a malevolent president like Trump, exploding the reach of such stories and their power to undermine democratic norms.
The book reminds us that democracy itself depends on a modicum of trust. That is why Trump’s ability to persuade so many Americans of the truth of so many lies has had such a disastrous effect on our body politic. Bowden and Teague have performed a singular service by revealing the details that disprove Republicans’ unceasing inventions about voter fraud. The problem is that so many Republicans will continue to ignore the lessons of this book. American democracy could still be destroyed by the torrent of voter suppression laws already passed by Republican-controlled state legislatures, spurred by lies invented by Trump and amplified by insidious “journalists” like Maria Bartiromo and Tucker Carlson, whose perfidy is brilliantly dissected in these pages. If democracy does prevail, it will survive because of the ability of authors like Teague and Bowden to make the truth even more compelling than Fox News fictions.

6015;6015;Garbo by Robert Gottlieb review – distant darling of the silver screen;2022-01-02T07:00:12Z;['Peter Conrad'];['Biography books', 'Greta Garbo', 'Books', 'Film', 'Culture'];"In more innocent or credulous days, the faithful sat in the dark to gaze at strange beings with detachable heads who were actually phantasms of light. Among the stars in this custom-made galaxy, the most alluring and yet the most distant was Greta Garbo, whose persona alternated between carnal heat and ascetic frost. After wickedly enticing her male victims in The Temptress, she redeemed herself as the dying courtesan in Camille; in Queen Christina, she was exalted by sacrifice and in a last mesmerising closeup all emotion blankly drained from her face as she renounced the throne and sailed into exile. Gradually this astral creature edged down to Earth. Publicists issued an excited proclamation when Garbo talked for the first time on screen in Anna Christie, even though she began by gruffly demanding a whisky in a waterfront bar. In Ninotchka, she made headlines all over again by contorting her alabaster features in a sudden fit of laughter.
Then, in 1941, she abruptly abandoned her career. Middle-aged fault lines in her perfect countenance have usually been blamed, but Robert Gottlieb’s book points to a change in the temper of the times. The young Fellini, puzzled by Garbo’s lunar pallor, mistook her for a ghost. In wartime, movie goddesses had to be less ethereal: they were now called bombshells because pilots painted their bodies on to the fuselage of the planes they flew into battle. Wispy and tremulous, Garbo lacked the ballistic sexual impact of Rita Hayworth in Gilda and unlike the pistol-packing Joan Crawford she was no spitfire. “I had made enough faces,” Garbo remarked when explaining why she quit. She knew herself to be a product, not a person, and disowned the mystique manufactured by the studio. The surname that MGM assigned to her was supposed to be Swedish for sprite, although alliteration prompted impish schoolboys to nickname her Greasy Garbage.
“You are in love with Garbo,” she told her besotted co-star John Gilbert, implying that he would not have been so infatuated by Greta Gustafsson from Stockholm, a shy mouse who late in life jokingly offered to work behind the counter in a Scandinavian deli near her New York apartment. Affecting anonymity in retirement, she insisted on being addressed as Miss Brown. Despite a succession of lovers, Garbo’s only long-term relationship, as Gottlieb says, was with the lens. She surrendered gladly to the Hollywood cameramen who trapped her soul on emulsion; later, she had to fend off paparazzi who stalked her in the street and tried to penetrate her disguises. When Chaplin became the most recognisable man in the world, he chummily acknowledged the applause of the multitudes. But Garbo fled from crowds in genuine terror and felt no sense of charitable obligation to her fans; it’s alleged that she even refused to sign an autograph book pitifully proffered by a soldier who was in uniform and on crutches.
Some called her divine, while for others she was a demon. A photograph by Clarence Sinclair Bull superimposes her imperishable head on the recumbent body of the Sphinx, which crumbles in the Egyptian desert. In Mata Hari, she performs an orientalised belly dance, dressed as a profane priestess and wearing a pagoda-shaped hat. Her earliest American films cast her as a vamp, a successor to the bewitching Theda Bara, whose invented name was an anagram of Arab death; the widow of Garbo’s saturnine protector George Schlee called her “that vampire” and after Schlee died, summoned a Russian Orthodox priest to exorcise their fridge because, when the purported blood drinker visited, she sometimes reached into it to grab a can of beer. Favouring men’s shoes and clothes, Garbo cultivated a teasing androgyny and one of the later projects with which she toyed was an adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray in which she would play the ageless, cruelly insensitive dandy; for the nubile actor who commits suicide when seduced and then spurned by Dorian, she wanted Marilyn Monroe. Envious and venomous, Marlene Dietrich boosted the emasculating myth by claiming that Garbo “raped men, she unzipped her fly and pounced on them”. Garbo retaliated with hazy hauteur. “Who is this Marlene Dietrich?” she once asked a reporter. Gottlieb is a renowned New York editor who at the age of 90 has earned the right to be self-indulgent and he chats wittily about his idol while leaving others to do the hard work of analysing Garbo’s appeal. In a small anthology of critical comments, Kenneth Tynan’s empurpled rhapsody about her physique – a neck that could be tilted at right angles to her spine, concave pectorals, a wayward, loping walk – is supplemented by a mystical reverie in which David Thomson regrets that “the church of cinema” where Garbo’s worshippers gathered has now been deconsecrated.
The Swedish actor Fritiof Billquist contributes a sharp insight that makes sense of her craving for solitary boredom and domestic banality, a condition she attained in her long, vacuous phone monologues about paying bills and shopping for groceries. “Hers,” Billquist says, “was the artistic nature’s jealousy of real life.” Best of all, Gottlieb dispenses with words in a gallery of photographs in which Garbo cups her head like the calyx of a flower, lowers her eyelids to semaphore desire or perhaps drowsiness and smokes a cigarette as if lighting a candle to place on her own altar. The mutable human face is saved from decay and flesh and blood are somehow sculpted into the likeness of Pallas Athene. • Garbo by Robert Gottlieb is published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux (£32).

6016;6016;New studies reinforce belief that Omicron is less likely to damage lungs;2022-01-02T07:00:11Z;['James Tapper'];['Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Medical research', 'Science', 'World news', 'UK news', 'Microbiology'];"A growing body of evidence indicates that the Omicron Covid variant is more likely to infect the throat than the lungs, which scientists believe may explain why it appears to be more infectious but less deadly than other versions of the virus. Six studies – four published since Christmas Eve – have found that Omicron does not damage people’s lungs as much as the Delta and other previous variants of Covid. The studies have yet to be peer-reviewed by other scientists. “The result of all the mutations that make Omicron different from previous variants is that it may have altered its ability to infect different sorts of cells,” said Deenan Pillay, professor of virology at University College London. “In essence, it looks to be more able to infect the upper respiratory tract – cells in the throat. So it would multiply in cells there more readily than in cells deep in the lung. This is really preliminary but the studies point in the same direction.” If the virus replicates more in the throat, that makes it more transmissible, which would help to explain the rapid spread of Omicron. A virus that is good at infecting lung tissue, on the other hand, will be potentially more dangerous but less transmissible. Researchers from the University of Liverpool’s Molecular Virology Research Group published a pre-print on Boxing Day that shows Omicron leading to “less severe disease” in mice, according to Prof James Stewart. The paper showed that mice infected with Omicron lose less weight, have lower viral loads and experience less- severe pneumonia. “It’s one piece of the jigsaw,” he said. “The animal model does suggest that the disease is less severe than Delta and the original Wuhan virus. It seems to get cleared faster and the animals recovered more rapidly, and that ties in with clinical data coming through. “The early indications are that it’s good news, but that’s not a signal to drop our guard, because if you’re clinically vulnerable, the consequences are still not great – there are deaths from Omicron. Not everyone can rip their masks off and party.” The Neyts Lab at Leuven University in Belgium found similar results in Syrian hamsters, with a lower viral load in the lungs compared with other variants. Prof Johan Neyts said this may be because the virus was better at infecting humans than hamsters, or that it was more likely to infect the upper respiratory tract, or that it provoked less-severe disease.
A further pre-print, submitted to Nature last week by researchers in the US, also found that mice with Omicron lost less weight and had a lower viral load. And researchers at the University of Glasgow’s Centre for Virus Research have found evidence that Omicron has changed the way it enters the body. Omicron was substantially likely to evade the immunity of people who had had two doses of the vaccine, but a booster dose gave a “partial restoration of immunity”. The slew of Christmas research builds on a study from the University of Hong Kong last month showing less Omicron infection in the lungs, and on research led by Prof Ravi Gupta at the University of Cambridge, whose team investigated blood samples from vaccinated patients. They found Omicron able to evade vaccines, but less able to enter lung cells. The latest scientific research comes amid a debate about how best to carry out home-testing. Last week, some scientists suggested that lateral flow tests (LFTs) might be more accurate if people took swabs from the throat as well as the nose. Prof Jennifer Rohn at University College London said that her experience of using LFTs was that she had tested negative using nose swabs but positive when taking a sample from her throat. That seemed to be supported by a study from South Africa showing that saliva samples subjected to PCR tests were better than nasal swabs at detecting Omicron. However, Prof Lawrence Young, virologist at the University of Warwick, said the study was not significant enough for conclusions to be drawn. “This is a small study on acutely symptomatic, non-hospitalised patients. On the one hand it confirms previous studies indicating that salivary testing could be useful as a more easily performed sampling approach. I don’t think this study is significant enough to conclude anything about the behaviour of Omicron.” The UK Health Security Agency said there was no indication that rapid tests differed in their ability to detect the Omicron or Delta variants, although the tests were continuously monitored by researchers. “All lateral flow devices used by NHS Test and Trace have gone through rigorous validation and are proven to be highly effective at detecting Covid-19 in people,” a spokesperson said. “We are currently seeing high numbers of positive lateral flow device tests reported. This means we are detecting tens of thousands of cases that might otherwise have gone undetected.” • This article was amended on 3 January 2022 because an earlier version said: “If the virus produces more cells in the throat, that makes it more transmissible ...”. The reference should have been: “If the virus replicates more in the throat...” This has been corrected.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/new-studies-reinforce-belief-that-omicron-is-less-likely-to-damage-lungs

One of the great reimaginings of the past decade, Martin Crimp’s version of Cyrano de Bergerac, in which the fights are rap battles, returns with the incandescent James McAvoy; Jamie Lloyd’s fiery production is at London’s Harold Pinter from 3 February, before moving to Glasgow. At London’s Donmar Warehouse from 11 February, Kit Harington stars in Max Webster’s modern staging of Henry V, which sets out to investigate England’s relationship with Europe and asks if we get the leaders we deserve. Also in London, from 10 March at the Gielgud, Rafe Spall becomes Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird. Aaron Sorkin’s adaptation of Harper Lee’s novel is directed by Bartlett Sher and designed by the mighty Miriam Buether. Susannah Clapp Music: pioneering solo females go from strength to strength A clutch of female auteurs are readying new albums, edging their way out of left field or heading straight for the mainstream. Japanese-American one-woman show Mitski follows up her breakout 2018 LP, Be the Cowboy, with the 80s-influenced Laurel Hell, due in February. Hurray for the Riff Raff, the vehicle for singer-songwriter Alynda Segarra (pictured above), promises a manual for Life on Earth, a “nature punk” album for tough times (February). Fresh from a slew of awards for her Broadway musical, Hadestown, cult figure Anaïs Mitchell steps into the spotlight with a self-titled album this month, with Aaron Dessner and Nico Muhly guesting. There’s more to come too, with projects expected from talents as diverse as Spanish pop sensation Rosalía and Korean multi-instrumentalist Park Jiha. Kitty Empire Art: blockbuster solo shows
The new year offers a great resurgence of solo shows, starting in January with the Royal Academy in London’s Francis Bacon: Man and Beast, already postponed by a year, but in this case better late than never. Dogs, hawks, monkeys, baboons: Bacon painted them like people and people as if they were creatures. Eventually, as the show reveals, the two became savagely indistinguishable. In February, Louise Bourgeois’s eerie stitched and stuffed figures get an overdue outing in The Woven Child at London’s Hayward Gallery, while Ai Weiwei juxtaposes new works against ancient Chinese objects to acute political effect at Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge. The Ikon Gallery in Birmingham has what promises to be a riveting show of paintings by Carlo Crivelli, arguing that the Italian Renaissance master was as radically outlandish as Magritte. And in March, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge focuses on David Hockney’s interactions with the different technologies of viewing, old and new, and with past art from Fra Angelico to Ingres and Manet. Laura Cumming Film: stories of complex, complicated women
A welcome addition to cinemas in the coming months is a collection of stroppy, unpredictable, unreliable and thoroughly difficult women. And the movie landscape is a whole lot more satisfying for it. Depictions of women have been freed up by a rejection of the traditional good versus bad mother binary, in films such as Maggie Gyllenhaal’s The Lost Daughter (now on Netflix) and Pedro Almodóvar’s Parallel Mothers (28 January). In the former, Olivia Colman’s self-described “unnatural mother” abandons her children for several years to pursue her career; in the latter, Penélope Cruz’s character, facing an impossible situation, makes all the wrong choices. But, crucially, neither is portrayed as a villain. Meanwhile, Harry Wootliff’s True Things (11 March) and Joachim Trier’s The Worst Person in the World (25 March) embrace the chaos of relationships and the car crash of career ambitions. Both are formally bold, bracingly unconventional films giving praise to the messy bitch, someone we can all relate to, one way or another. Wendy Ide Classical: three opera firsts
British Nigerian actor-director Femi Elufowoju Jr makes his operatic debut directing Verdi’s tragedy Rigoletto (opens 22 January), conducted by Opera North’s music director, Garry Walker. The American baritone Eric Greene sings the title role, with American soprano Jasmine Habersham and Russian tenor Roman Arndt. On 5 February, the company launches its first ever staging of Alcina, Handel’s opera of witchery, deception and disguise, conducted by world-class Handelian Laurence Cummings, directed by Tim Albery. There’s more Handel at the Royal Opera House in London: a new staging of Theodora, the first at Covent Garden since 1750, directed by Katie Mitchell with an all-star cast (opens 31 January). Fiona Maddocks TV: literary adaptations
A quirk of pandemic production delays was that literary adaptations were unusually thin on the ground during 2021. Happily, that means there’s a backlog waiting for broadcast this year. Indeed, the TV drama slate will begin to resemble your bookshelf come to life. First out of the blocks this month is Len Deighton’s The Ipcress File on ITV, with Joe Cole taking on the role of bespectacled spy Harry Palmer. This will be followed in February/March by Sally Rooney’s Conversations With Friends, from the same BBC team that brought us lockdown hit Normal People. Coming in early spring, screenwriter Steven Moffat has adapted Audrey Niffenegger’s romance The Time Traveler’s Wife for HBO/Sky, with Rose Leslie and Theo James as the magical lovers. Keeley Hawes stars in Sky’s modern-day reimagining of John Wyndham’s sci-fi classic The Midwich Cuckoos. On Netflix, Benedict Cumberbatch leads a reboot of John Buchan’s conspiracy thriller The 39 Steps, while Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss tackle Richard Powers’s sweeping eco-epic The Overstory. Later in the year, Fleishman Is in Trouble will air on Disney+ and Anatomy of a Scandal on Netflix. Phew. Our page-to-screen cups overfloweth. Michael Hogan Music: post-punk is evergreen
Here’s a growth industry: less a genre than a state of mind, the post-punk tendency continues to throw out apposite sounds for straitened times. Kicking off the year with a polemic are hotly tipped Leeds underground heroes Yard Act, whose debut album, The Overload, is out 21 January. From atonal, jazz-strewn beginnings, Black County, New Road’s second album, Ants from Up There, dials up the tunefulness on 4 February. Indie sensations Wet Leg crown their dizzying rise with their debut album, expected in the spring. Meanwhile, you can see Bristol guitar powerhouses Idles playing their very recent album, Crawler, through big PA systems starting on 16 January. KE Theatre: reappraising famous men
Two reputations with opposite trajectories. In Dr Semmelweis, Mark Rylance appears as the doctor who, in 19th-century Vienna, introduced antisepsis into medical practice. He now appears self-evidently a pioneer, but died reviled and self-doubting. Based on an idea by Rylance, developed with Stephen Brown and Tom Morris, the play is at Bristol Old Vic from 20 January to 12 February. At the Bridge theatre in London from 16 March to 18 June, Ralph Fiennes stars in David Hare’s Straight Line Crazy, a portrait of Robert Moses, “for 40 years the most powerful man in New York”, at first regarded as an idealist, later as an intimidating manipulator with a divisive vision of city life. SC Architecture: three brilliant new buildings
The Burrell Collection in Glasgow is a quirky but brilliant building designed around both its parkland setting and a personal, magnificent and eclectic array of objects – a Romanesque arch, for example, is built into its fabric. In March, 39 years after the building was completed, it will reopen with a revamp by John McAslan + Partners. The challenge is to update it without losing its soul. Also due in March is the new campus for the Royal College of Art in Battersea in south London, composed of rugged-looking brickwork, by the Swiss architectural powerhouse Herzog & de Meuron (authors of Tate Modern, the Beijing Olympic stadium). In February, a brand new theatre will open (not something you see every day): the Brixton House in south London. Its architects, Foster Wilson Size, a practice with a number of performance spaces under their belt, promise a “purposefully robust” and adaptable building, “in keeping with the spirit of studio theatre”. Rowan Moore Film: Tilda Swinton double feature
We only saw Tilda Swinton in one film (one-and-a-half, counting Almodóvar’s short The Human Voice) in 2021, making it a fallow year by the prolific star’s standards. The year 2022, however, is serving us a double scoop of Swinton genius straight off the bat. As a woman journeying into the Colombian jungle to seek the origin of a psychological disturbance, she’s on mesmerising, minimalist form in Thai auteur Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s dreamy experiment Memoria (14 January), while she tenderly supports her real-life daughter Honor Swinton Byrne in Joanna Hogg’s exquisite autofiction follow-up, The Souvenir Part II (4 February). Guy Lodge Art: contemporary art
Contemporary art shows include the witty and spatially complex figurative paintings of Canadian artist Allison Katz at Camden Art Centre in north London (from 14 January), alongside poetic multimedia installations by French-Caribbean rising star Julien Creuzet. Goldsmith’s CCA in London devotes its whole space to the evergreen question of monuments and what they are for, with works by 50 artists (from 21 January). Sculptors in glass, at the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds (from 18 February), includes Alexandra Engelfriet, Mona Hatoum and the Guyanese-British artist Hew Locke, who also undertakes the latest Tate Britain Commission in March. Look out, too, for US artist Howardena Pindell’s beautiful abstract paintings at the Fruitmarket in Edinburgh (now showing), and Chinese installation artist Wang Gongxin at White Cube Mason’s Yard in London (from 19 January), with his response to the ubiquitous presence of shadows. LC Theatre: Our Generation
Alecky Blythe, author of London Road, has opened the ears of theatregoers with her verbatim dramas. Her new play, Our Generation, is based on interviews gathered over a period of five years. It follows the lives of 12 young people growing into adulthood, and is directed by Daniel Evans, artistic director of Chichester Festival theatre, where the production will move after playing at the National Theatre in London from 10 February to 9 April. SC TV: returning gangsters
Cue Nick Cave and don your flat cap because Peaky Blinders is back to start 2022 with a Brummie bang. This will be the BBC period epic’s sixth and final series, although a film spin-off is also in the works. Down the M6, three stylish returning dramas portray different strata of London’s contemporary criminal underworld. In February/March, Netflix’s Top Boy continues the battle for drug-dealing supremacy on Hackney’s fictional Summerhouse estate. BBC One’s McMafia finds James Norton reprising his role as the ruthless British son of a Russian mafioso. And Sky Atlantic’s swaggering Gangs of London sees turf wars erupt as rival syndicates fight to fill the power void left by the debut season’s corpse-littered carnage. MH Podcasts: The Sweat 7 and Blip Blip
From the producers of The Smart 7 , a hugely successful daily podcast that packages news, both serious and light, into seven stories in seven minutes, come two new audio offerings. First up is The Sweat 7 (10 January), a daily keep-fit show with, you guessed it, seven HIIT exercises to bash through in seven minutes. Hosted by personal trainer Georgie Okell, there’ll be accompanying explanatory animations on Instagram to show how the exercises should be done. More innovative is Blip Blip (17 January), a super-short podcast for a scrolling, visual generation who find seven minutes an eternity. Just 90 seconds long, Blip Blip will pop up on TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube Shorts and WhatsApp three times a day, offering all the showbiz news that gen Z needs to know. An interesting experiment that, if it does well, could herald one way of enticing young people into listening as well as looking. Miranda Sawyer Classical: Voices Unwrapped
The year-long Voices Unwrapped at London’s Kings Place celebrates everything that’s singable, from Renaissance and baroque masterworks to jazz, gospel and folk, close harmony and performance poetry. The baritone Roderick Williams and Gaelic/Hebridean singer Julie Fowlis are artists-in-focus. The opening event (13 January) features top ensemble Voces8, with composer-conductor Eric Whitacre. Expect to hear singers from Denmark, Estonia, Australia and the African diaspora, plus the Tallis Scholars, Black Voices and the evergreen Swingles. FM Film: unusual queer love stories
The year is kicking off with a rich seam of LGBTQ+ cinema, with a number of films granting new political and historical dimensions to queer relationship stories. Jonas Poher Rasmussen’s Oscar-tipped animated documentary Flee (11 February) weaves a gay love story into its powerful study of an Afghan immigrant in Europe reflecting on his harrowing refugee childhood. Meanwhile, Sebastian Meise’s wonderful, Cannes-awarded drama Great Freedom (4 March) examines the history of Germany’s anti-gay Paragraph 175 law through the long-term bond between a repeatedly incarcerated gay man (the superb Franz Rogowski) and his initially homophobic cellmate. GL Theatre: Punchdrunk’s The Burnt City
Immersive theatre maestros Punchdrunk return to their home town of London after an absence of seven years. In their lofty new quarters at Woolwich Works – three Grade II-listed buildings stretching over 100,000 sq ft – the company will tell the story of the fall of Troy, transposing the tragedy to a future parallel world. Palaces and a “pulsating underworld” are promised. The Burnt City is booking from 22 March to 28 August. SC Music: the tome of their lives
There will always be blockbuster music memoirs. Often, though, the good stuff is in the margins. In 1969, Vashti Bunyan set out in a horse-drawn wagon from London to Scotland, writing a cult folk album, Just Another Diamond Day, as she went. Her reminiscences, Wayward (out 31 March), capture the times with great poignancy. Former punk Kathy Valentine was in the Go-Gos, the first all-female band to get to No 1 in the US playing their own instruments; therein lies a tale (All I Ever Wanted, out March). However well we feel we know the Wainwright clan, the forthcoming memoir, Stories I Might Regret Telling You (March), by Martha Wainwright looks set to supply new insights into the folk dynasty. KE Radio/podcast: Now You’re Asking With Marian Keyes and Tara Flynn
The hilarious writer Marian Keyes and actor Tara Flynn return to Radio 4 next Sunday with a new problem-solving show. Having asked people to email in their dilemmas, the dynamic duo set out to solve them at their “virtual kitchen table”. A neighbour’s garden ornaments, a daughter’s messy house and a difficulty with a father’s will are all tackled in the first episode. “Most things are survivable,” insists Keyes, while Flynn confesses that, actually, her “three favourite words are ‘I don’t know’”. Both are warm and kind enough to not only be funny but also offer genuinely thoughtful, if left-field, advice. MS TV: screen stars in game-changing roles
Prepare to do a double take as three scene-stealing young actors tackle starkly contrasting roles. Erin Doherty, who won admirers as Princess Anne in The Crown, drops the plummy accent to star in BBC Three’s Chloe, a psychological thriller about social media and identity. Jamie-Lee O’Donnell, AKA wild child Michelle in Derry Girls, embraces her dark side in gritty Channel 4 prison drama Screw. And in Disney+ bio-drama Pam & Tommy, yes, that is Britain’s own Lily James beneath that peroxide wig in the true story of Pamela Anderson’s scandalous sex tape with Tommy Lee, arguably the first ever viral video. MH Music: live music is back* (*unless it isn’t)
At the time of writing, the prospect of live music is very much still on for 2022. Some much-missed big beasts are due back in arenas early this year and there are few more major than Stormzy, who has yet to tour his 2019 hit, Heavy Is the Head. Fingers crossed, from 13 March, the rapper will play his rescheduled 2021 dates, bringing some of his Glastonbury-headlining gravitas to arenas countrywide. Fellow national UK hip-hop treasure Dave takes his lauded second album, We’re Alone in This Together, out to audiences starved of togetherness from 15 February. KE Art: surrealists take over
From 24 February, Tate Modern’s Surrealism Beyond Borders goes further than so many previous shows by expanding its survey to 45 countries across five decades. A fresh appraisal of the eye-popping, mind-boggling, ID-twisting art that now includes wild and weird objects and paintings from nations as far apart as Syria, Thailand and Romania. Arriving from the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the show has already been hailed as startling, chaotic and glorious. LC Classical: Britten’s got talent
For Coventry’s year as city of culture, and the 60th anniversary since the consecration of the city’s cathedral, composer-performer Nitin Sawhney has written Ghosts in the Ruins, a site-specific “war requiem” in response to Benjamin Britten’s War Requiem, premiered at Basil Spence’s new cathedral in the 1962 Coventry festival. Exploring themes of refugees, migrants and asylum, Ghosts will include singers and musicians moving around the building and out into the bombed ruins of the old cathedral (28 and 29 January). Two other Britten masterpieces head the operatic season. At Scottish Opera, Dominic Hill, artistic director of Glasgow’s Citizens theatre, directs Britten’s dazzling take on Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, conducted by Stuart Stratford (opens Glasgow, 22 February, Edinburgh, 1 March). At London’s Royal Opera House, Deborah Warner directs Peter Grimes, starring Allan Clayton as the anguished fisherman, with a top cast conducted by Mark Elder (opens 17 March). FM Film: the return of Bradley Cooper
There’s an interesting paradox regarding the casting of Bradley Cooper. As a hero, he can be bland – a synthetic shiny smile pasted on to wholesome catalogue-model good looks. But in the role of a villain, that glittering charm takes on a devilish quality. He’s thrilling and dangerous and utterly compelling. The good news for fans of bad Bradley is that he’s back after a career hiatus and, for the next two films at least, Cooper has taken up residence on the dark side. In Guillermo del Toro’s neo-noir Nightmare Alley, he’s a magician with blood on his hands; in Paul Thomas Anderson’s just released Licorice Pizza, he plays a monstrous Hollywood producer. WI Radio: channel hopping
Andrew Marr will make his big move from the BBC in early 2022, taking up new slots at LBC and Classic FM. His Radio 4 Start the Week hosting duties appear to have been taken up by the three remaining hosts, Tom Sutcliffe, Amol Rajan and Kirsty Wark, though, if a headliner is needed, Wark would seem the obvious choice. Reportedly, Marr moved because he wanted the freedom to express his climate emergency opinions. At LBC, he will find ex-BBC compatriots Eddie Mair and Shelagh Fogarty; at Classic FM, he’ll be joining Moira Stewart. On Heart, a personnel shift means that another ex-BBC host, Dev Griffin, will be on weekday afternoons, while Yasmin Evans, who left 1Xtra late last year, is taking up a weekend slot on the same station. Clearly, commercial radio’s dynamism and editorial freedom are tempting some BBC long-termers away from the mothership. MS Theatre: Anna Karenina
Tolstoy’s novel takes to the stage in a version by Helen Edmundson, scriptwriter of Mary Magdalene, whose plays include adaptations of Small Island and Coram Boy for the National and, for Bristol Old Vic, the musical Swallows and Amazons. Anna Karenina (how will they do the train?) will be directed by Anthony Lau, associate artistic director at Sheffield Theatres, and can be seen at the Crucible, Sheffield, from 5 to 26 February. SC Photography: a trio of treats
The photography year kicks off with the surreal and extravagantly staged scenarios of the LA-based artist Alex Prager, known for her genre-crossing images of raw contemporary Hollywood shot through with old movie glamour. At London’s Lehmann Maupin (from 21 January), her new works insert present reality into a cinematic past. The annual Deutsche Börse shortlist is on show at London’s Photographer’s Gallery from 25 March, with very strong contenders including Jo Ratcliffe’s celebrated geopolitical landscapes of South Africa and Deana Lawson’s exacting tableaux of America’s black diaspora. Also in March, Milton Keynes Gallery has a retrospective of Ingrid Pollard’s poetic photo-meditations on racial displacement and identity, from 12 March, travelling to the Turner Margate in July. LC TV: This Is Going to Hurt
Ben Whishaw hasn’t done any homegrown TV since his Emmy-winning 2018 turn in A Very English Scandal. In February/March he makes his BBC comeback in this anarchic, visceral adaptation of Adam Kay’s bestselling memoir about working on an NHS labour ward. Expect exhaustingly long hours, life-or-death decisions, battles with the hospital hierarchy, “a constant tsunami of bodily fluids” and plenty of gallows humour.

6018;6018;May I have a word about making light of our cricket defeats | Jonathan Bouquet;2022-01-02T07:00:10Z;['Jonathan Bouquet'];['Cricket', 'England cricket team', 'Ashes 2021-22'];One of the pleasures of this Ashes series has been Michael Atherton’s daily despatches. (I see your eyes rolling at the word pleasures - I’m sure you have your own epithets.) In his report on the second day of the Test in Melbourne, he managed to wrest some dark humour from another calamitous day with a couple of gags from Australian wits - on England failing to materialise - “Only one team at the ground? That’s how it’s been all series.” Caught Covid? “About the only thing they have caught this series, cobber.” In these dire sporting times, we must take comfort where we can. I mentioned in my last column that my wife was doing an MA in medieval literature and was always turning up fascinating words. This week is no exception. She drew my attention to a review of Personal Pleasures: Essays on Enjoying Life by Rose Macaulay in the London Review of Books, in which the reviewer pointed up Macaulay’s passion for words and cited the following that particularly delighted her: cantiferous, sedilian, empatining and hagiary. Sadly, none of these made it into the OED and they pretty much fox Google, but I feel that we should celebrate her ardour. There was a very decent line from Joanna Lumley in Meltdown, a Radio 4 play, last week: “Social media? Shouldn’t it be antisocial media?” Good point. Finally, to the reader who upbraided me for confusing Augean and Aegean (he wrote: “What a pity that Jonathan Bouquet spoilt his column by mis-spelling the filthy stables - the Augean stables were named after a king of Elis, and have no link with the photogenic Aegean Sea”). This was preceded by the phrase “the most wonderful malapropism”. There was a clue there. • Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist;https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/may-i-have-a-word-about-making-light-of-our-cricket-defeats
6019;6019;Outsider from the right backed by Hungary’s left to beat Orbán;2022-01-02T06:45:10Z;['Jennifer Rankin'];['Hungary', 'Europe', 'Viktor Orbán', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'World news'];"When Hungarian opposition leader Péter Márki-Zay was in Brussels at the end of last year, he visited the street where an MEP from prime minister Viktor Orbán’s ruling party, Fidesz, had fled down a drainpipe to evade a police raid on a “gay orgy” that broke lockdown rules. The MEP, who later resigned, had been an architect of a clause in Hungary’s constitution defining marriage as a heterosexual institution. The drainpipe visit was easy political capital for Márki-Zay, seeking to draw attention to the hypocrisy of the governing party, while stressing his commitment to LGBT rights and conservative credentials. It’s the kind of move that has discombobulated Fidesz, who weren’t expecting to face this kind of challenge in Hungary’s parliamentary elections in spring 2022. Márki-Zay, a conservative churchgoing father of seven, is the candidate for prime minister of six opposition parties, spanning social democrats to the former far right, who united to take on Orbán. “After 16 years it’s the first time the opposition has a real chance to win,” Róbert László, an election specialist at the Political Capital institute in Budapest, said. Hungarians go to the polls in April or May in a contest that could bring down Orbán, whose 11-year experiment with “illiberal democracy” has resulted in Hungary becoming the first EU member state to be classed as only “partly free” by the NGO Freedom House.
“Nobody expected the left and centre parties who dominated the opposition could be led by an outsider coming from the right,” László said. “One of his super-powers is that he can’t be blamed as the puppet of the past leftist parties, or the ex-prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsány,” a wealthy former leader who remains deeply divisive. Fidesz was preparing for a left-liberal candidate, such as the mayor of Budapest, Gergely Karácsony, or the leader of the Democratic Coalition, Klára Dobrev, who is married to Gyurcsány. “Now we can see that the Fidesz propaganda machine is confused,” László said. “[Márki-Zay] is not a liberal intelligentsia, he seems to be much more like a Fidesz member.” Márki-Zay was never a party member, but he did vote Fidesz. He hasn’t since 2010. “I just became more and more upset with their populism, their betrayal of western values … corruption mostly,” he told the Observer. “Orbán has changed, not me.” Speaking to journalists, Márki-Zay sought to distinguish his faith from Orbán’s professions in defence of Hungary’s Christian culture. “I was a Christian way before Orbán. Orbán was still in the Communist youth movement when I attended church every Sunday in communist times.”
It’s a typically blunt statement from Márki-Zay, who is equally plain-speaking in English and Hungarian. He polished his English during nearly five years in North America, where he worked for a car-parts company. Márki-Zay, who has two degrees and a PhD in economic history, spent five weeks in Canada working as a door-to-door salesman. His firm later promoted him to a job in the US, where political curiosity took him to 2008 campaign events for presidential contenders Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain. Known to the Hungarian political world as MZP, Márki-Zay made his political debut in his hometown of Hódmezővásárhely, a Fidesz stronghold in southern Hungary. Two days after he announced his mayoral run in 2018, he was dismissed from his job at an electrical components company. Soon after, five surveillance cameras appeared on his street. Government-friendly media launched vicious attacks on his wife. More recently he has been called an American spy, a CIA agent and a tool of Gyurcsány.
This kind of smear campaign is typical, says Zoltán Kész, a former MP who has thrown his support behind Márki-Zay. Kész says he saw Márki-Zay’s potential in 2018: “He is a statesman, he is not the kind of guy who wants to be a politician just for the sake of politics… You can see it in his eyes that he has determination to change the system for the good.” Kész offered his support, despite their political differences. “He’s a conservative, I’m a liberal [libertarian]. He’s very religious, I’m not, but we both believe Hungary isn’t democratic now.” So far, Márki-Zay has managed to unite the six opposition parties while keeping his distance. “The electorate – including myself – have put huge pressure on these opposition parties to unite and defeat Mr Orbán,” hesaid, underlining that he does not belong to any of the six. “So yes… it took them too long to understand this and to put aside disagreements.” However, Daniel Hegedüs of the German Marshall Fund noted Márki-Zay has not yet boosted support for the opposition, with most polls showing a tight race. The situation is worse than opinion polls suggest, he adds, as the redrawing of electoral districts by Fidesz has given the ruling party an advantage. “The united opposition should win at least 3 to 5% more votes to get a majority mandate in the Hungarian national assembly. That’s a huge difference and we don’t see this advantage in the polls yet,” Hegedüs said. “The political race isn’t taking place on an even playing field; it’s heavily tilted to Orbán,” Hegedüs added. The integrity of the 2022 election will be even worse than in 2014, or 2018, which were “free but not fair”, he said. “It’s already a dirty contest and it will be a huge task for the opposition to win.” Meanwhile, Marki-Zay treads a fine line between attracting disillusioned Fidesz voters while retaining urban left-liberals. The Hódmezővásárhely mayor supports some of Orbán’s migration policies. While he has promised to repeal Hungary’s “homophobic” anti-gay law, his tone strikes analysts as reminiscent of Fidesz, by suggesting being gay is a handicap that can be used as leverage in politics. “It’s not necessarily an attractive offer for [some opposition voters] if the joint candidate is similar in some respects to the incumbent,” Hegedüs said. His close associate, Kész, thinks the opposition will stick together. “There’s no other choice. If he can’t hold the six parties together he’s lost, the whole of Hungary’s lost. Each party understands the gravity of the situation.” • This article was amended on 2 January 2022 to correct misspellings of Zoltán Kész’s surname as “Késv”.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/outsider-peter-marki-zay-from-the-right-backed-by-hungarys-left-to-beat-orban

The same as every morning, just a little later. Most mornings we’re up at 7am for school runs and all that nonsense. You can tell we’re middle-aged: sleeping to half eight feels indulgent. A slow start? If the boys have a football match we’re up and out. If the game is nearby, I’ll join them. My husband always ends up being referee; it seems very political. I come with my fold-out chair and flask of tea and sit on the sideline happily. I never have a clue what’s going on, but I’ll cheer them on anyway. If there’s no sport? We take the dog for a walk. I like to get a sandwich from a cafe and chuck the dog a sausage. It’s the only exercise I enjoy, and has improved my health immensely. Since getting a dog I’m always out and about, and my asthmatic lungs are grateful. A special Sunday? My twin boys were born on a Saturday, four weeks early, on a weekend our whole family was visiting. On the Sunday they came in to meet the little ones. I stayed on the ward with the kids; they all went home for Sunday dinner. Did they bring me any? Did they heck. Thankfully, I was delirious from all the drugs so didn’t notice. Sundays growing up? Mum and dad ran a club, so I spent Sundays with my grandparents. Gran did a cracking roast, except for her four-day boiled cabbage. I was a teenager before I knew vegetables had crunch or flavour. Grandad would drink the cabbage water, it was a proper northern romance. I try to carry those family- time traditions on, it feels important. Sunday evening? We spend an hour arguing about what to watch on TV and usually settle on a film that leaves us all disappointed. After putting the boys to bed we might sneak in a glass of wine while doing diaries. Then I fall asleep. God, we’re dead boring.

6021;6021;The Observer view on Britain’s climate crisis targets | Observer editorial;2022-01-02T06:30:10Z;['Observer editorial'];['Climate crisis', 'Climate Change Committee', 'Politics', 'Greenhouse gas emissions', 'Environment', 'Renewable energy', 'Energy', 'Boris Johnson', 'UK news', 'World news'];"Britain’s electricity generation went through an unfortunate phase last year. According to the UK-based website Carbon Brief, it got dirtier for the first time in years as renewable sources failed to provide sufficient power to help the nation’s economy recover from lockdown restrictions. More coal and gas had to be burned to generate electricity. This jump occurred – in part – because 2021 was notable for its low winds. Wind farm output dropped by almost 15% from 2020, despite the fact that more turbines had been installed across the nation. At the same time, nuclear power generation fell by almost 10% because of problems with ageing reactors. It is a sobering reminder that the road to limit climate change is going to be a long one, though, in this case, the news is particularly unfortunate, given that Britain is still in charge of the negotiations that followed the Cop26 summit in Glasgow last year. Indeed, the nation will remain in this position of leadership until Egypt takes charge at the end of 2022, when its Cop27 summit opens in Sharm el-Sheikh. Until then, the world will be looking to Britain to set a lead and to play a major role in ensuring that the promises made in Glasgow are fulfilled.
What other nations will have witnessed so far will not have made a good impression, however. The fact that the UK last year failed to clean up its power generation, one of the easiest ways to start on the business of cutting carbon emission, is bad enough. Sadly, there have been many other setbacks in the UK’s attempts to fight climate change. Another example was provided by the public accounts committee, which last month savaged the government over the failure of its green homes grant scheme in England. The programme underperformed so badly it risks damaging future efforts to deliver net zero, the committee warned. Hailed by Boris Johnson as a key plank in his green industrial revolution, the scheme was intended to help the public make their homes more energy efficient and less reliant on fossil fuel heating. This was to be done by providing grants for installing heat pumps and other equipment. A total of 600,000 homes were targeted but in the end just 47,500 were upgraded, while only a small fraction of the expected jobs were created in the process. As Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the committee, put it: “This scheme was a slam dunk fail.” Power generation and carbon-friendly housing are clearly issues that need to be tackled urgently. But they are not the only problems that lie ahead. As another government body, the Climate Change Committee, made clear last month, the UK desperately needs a strategy to reduce carbon emissions from agriculture and to review how tax policy can help deliver net zero. This last issue is particularly important because the Treasury is now under pressure to reduce VAT on gas in response to the energy crisis – at a time when it should be making it more expensive in order to discourage its use. However, the committee’s key message was even more direct: the UK must now focus on implementation rather than targets. In other words, we need action, not words, when it comes to tackling climate change in 2022 and that action should come not just from Alok Sharma, currently president of Cop26, but from all senior ministers, including Boris Johnson. Certainly, if they do not act firmly over the coming year, and provide international leadership, then the goal to limit global warming to 1.5C will be dead.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/observer-view-britains-climate-crisis-targets

We are now looking forward to, well, real life. So let’s think of things to lift our spirits. Things that make us look, feel and smell nice. Shallow yes, but a mood booster. Gucci’s primer balances skin that (like mine) has the capacity toproduce an oilfield. You’ll be matte but not comatose. Charlotte Tilbury’s 30-shade-strong foundation is infused with skincare ingredients and leaves skin looking like skin. For an overnight treatment that works wonders on thirsty skin, Elemis’s Midnight Facial is magic. And if you have parched hair, Aveda’s super-hydrating masques will make a difference immediately. Anyone who uses eyelash curlers will dump them after trying Maybelline’s Colossal Curl Bounce. Cerave Micellar Water – chock-full of niacinamide (great for pigmentation issues) and nourishing ceramides – cleanses skin without stripping it. I also love Inkey List’s new cleanser – the hyaluronic continues to work post rinsing off. Genius. Most eye creams are useless, Tata Harper’s, however – reformulated to tackle puffy eyes and dark circles – is worth a shot. To combat winter’s moisture-depleting powers, use Keys Soulcare Body Balm. For a sensuous, comforting and, dare I say it, sexy scent, I cannot recommend Jo Malone London’s Velvet Rose and Oud highly enough. Look I’m not saying healthy skin, fluttery lashes and skin health, smelling nice and having fluttery lashes will cure the world of January blues – but it will bring an element of joy.

Happy 2022. May your gardens grow. Rows of cockleshells, optional. Now we know January can be a cold month, likely to harbour frost. So it’s worth checking your plot one early-ish morning to see where the icy patches are. Avoid siting tender plants there. There’s still much other stuff to do – Including staying snug inside. It is time, from now, to order seed potatoes for planting out in late February or March. We stick to first earlies, probably something waxy, though I am also prone to being seduced by a pretty burgundy or purple potato. Rules as usual: leave in a tray on a cool (unheated) dry place in natural light. I will stick to chitting in egg trays with most ‘eyes’ upwards as I learned from Dudley, my dad. You must do what you think best. If your ground isn’t frozen, you can catch up with broad beans. And even garlic, but we will wait a couple of months and maybe add onions (though I’ll admit to quite constant disappointment). I often choose to admire Mary’s instead. Either way, you should be able to buy/order onion sets and garlic now. Sort though seed packets and planting plans for the year if you haven’t already. It takes me a few goes in a fairly futile attempt to be ruthless. If nothing else, it’s good to check for damaged packs or insect infestation, particularly if you store seed in a shed. We’ll also order our rarer stock around now in case it sells out later in the season. We’ll flirt with making plans for what to grow where through the year, though it is unlikely we will stick to it if past years are an indicator. Howard or I tend to stand where we think the bed or row might go while the other has a think. So please be more you than me. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

6024;6024;Dry January? Try these non-alcoholic drinks;2022-01-02T06:00:11Z;['David Williams'];['Wine', 'Food', 'Life and style'];"Guinness, 0.0%, from £4, 4x440ml can, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons There are two ways to approach a month off the sauce, as many of us have vowed to do this January. Either you go for non-alcoholic drinks that are their own thing, and always have been (of which more below). Or you can adapt what I like to think of as the Linda McCartney model: weaning yourself off your favourites with a clever simulacrum that doesn’t contain the substance (animal products for Linda; alcohol for you) you’re trying to avoid. As someone who would happily own up to being vegan-curious but not quite ready to move beyond flexitarian status, I’ve eaten my share of Quorn sausages, beetroot-blood burgers and fake chicken schnitzel- type things, and I’m impressed by just how far they’ve developed in the past couple of years. Realistic booze substitutes have moved on, too, with the choice now extending far beyond the lonely bottle of Clausthaler (itself much better than it was), and with the latest big brand 0.0% contender from Guinness coming extremely, satisfyingly close to the real thing. La Gioiosa Italian Sparkling White, 0.0% £5, 75cl, Morrisons Other convincing low-alcohol beers that I’ve found can fill in a flavoury gap without the alcohol include Estrella’s crisply refreshing Spanish lager Free Damm (from £4.50, 6x330ml, Sainsbury’s Morrisons and others) and two IPAs: Connecticut-basedzero-alcohol specialist craft brewer Athletic Brewing Co’s citrussy, balanced IPA (£10.99, 6x355ml, uk.athleticbrewing.com) and East Anglian brewer Adnams’s 0.5% version of its trusty Ghost Ship (£10.99, 8x500ml bottle, adnams.co.uk). What all four beers I’ve mentioned here (and other top-notch no-alcohol brews)get right are the richness of texture and depth of flavour : there’s nothing watery about them. This is something winemakers haven’t managed to achieve just yet. The best wines are low-alcohol (with around 7-9% abv)rather than no alcohol. The most drinkable zero-alcohol wines make up the textural shortfall with sugar and bubbles, so the sweetly fizzy end result of a wine, such as La Gioisa’s, is more fizzy pop than prosecco-alike. LA Brewery Strawberry & Black Pepper Kombucha, £35, 12x300ml, LA Brewery The most common advice that vegan chefs proffer to people making the switch to a plant-only diet (as, again, so many of us are doing for what I suppose I’m going to have to call ‘veganuary’ this year) is to try to break away from meat-centred thinking – don’t treat vegan cuisine as coping with something missing; think of it as an opportunity to celebrate all the many and diverse ingredients found beyond the meat counter. And of course, you can take the same approach to going alcohol-free. Admittedly, this is easier to achieve online: outside big urban centres, pubs and restaurants still rely on standard sweet fizzy drinks or mineral water as alcohol-free alternatives. Still, it would be hard I think, for any palate used to the complexity of the best alcoholic drinks to feel they were missing out if they were offered something as deliciously sweet-sour-spicy as the strawberry and black pepper kombucha (fermented tea) of Suffolk’s LA Brewery.

6026;6026;Edwina Currie badgers northerners and Ron Atkinson gets the sack: A look back at 1986. By Chris Hall;2022-01-02T06:00:11Z;['Chris Hall'];['Life and style'];For its final issue of 1986, the Observer Magazine looked back at ‘The Good, the Bad, the Ugly… and the boring’ of the previous 12 months. It was the year, we said, when ‘the North/South divide became an abyss’ as junior health minister Edwina Currie badgered northerners about their drinking and smoking, saying they would die of ‘ignorance and chips’. The Jeffrey Archer book she’s brandishing on the cover, First Among Equals, was made into a TV series in 1986, and ‘Archer resigns again. Shock, horror, yawn,’ was our line on him quitting as Tory deputy chairman. Hang on, what’s Ron Atkinson doing in the Good section? Ah, ‘good’ as in ‘riddance’ – ‘Poor old Ron Atkinson, the Flash Harry of football, was sacked from Man Utd in early November: nobody loves a loser and Manchester least of all.’ His replacement, Alex Ferguson, did rather better, but I see they’ve since gone back to sacking managers. Other items were good or bad, depending on your view, including the news that Wham! had split up, to the ‘inconsolable grief of music lovers,’ apparently. The ‘People’s Party succumbed to the image makers, abandoning the red flag for the red rose,’ presaging New Labour. And there was a great in-joke with a deliberately distorted colour picture of newspaper boss Eddie Shah, which used to bedevil Today, which he launched that year. In the Ugly section, not only had ‘a sinister new drug, “crack”, concentrated cocaine in capsule form, crossed the Atlantic to Britain’but there was also ‘the ubiquitous puffball skirt’, which ‘ inflated ugliness to new widths’. In September our ‘future philosopher king’ first revealed to ITN, ‘I just come and talk to the plants… they respond, I find.’ Even more boringly, there’s a picture of Margaret Thatcher astride an empty middle lane opening the last stretch of the M25. ‘I cannot stand those who carp and criticise,’ she said. ‘Now you can go round London in 80 days,’ we carped.;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/edwina-currie-badgers-northerners-and-ron-atkinson-gets-the-sack-a-look-back-at-1986
6027;6027;Sarap Filipino Bistro: ‘Many of the dishes are real showstoppers’ - restaurant review;2022-01-02T06:00:11Z;['Jay Rayner'];['Food', 'Restaurants', 'Restaurants', 'Life and style', 'Travel', 'Filipino food and drink'];"Sarap Filipino Bistro, 10 Heddon Street, London W1B 4BX (020 3488 9769; saraplondon.com). Starters £8.50-£13; mains £18-£25; desserts £5.50-£7.50; wines from £27 Eating a whole piglet is like staging an orgy; you need more than two people to get the job done. The problem is that, when I review a restaurant there are only ever two of us, and that makes both propositions very tricky. Admittedly the latter is rarely on the menu during restaurant visits; neither of us is likely to be orgy fit. But at Sarap Bistro the former most certainly was an option, and I was at least four people short of a piglet party. Sarap belongs to the chef Ferdinand “Budgie” Montoya, and is part of his ongoing exploration of the food of the Philippines, where he was born. Key to that is the famed lechon: roast piglet, with golden, shattering skin and the tenderest, sweetest of meat. (If you are a meat eater with a taste for lamb, but still want to be absolutely livid about the consumption of young pigs, muster your arguments now.) Here, the lechon comes stuffed with lemongrass and truffled adobo rice. Sounds great doesn’t it. There’s only one problem: you have to order a whole damn piglet two days in advance, and muster a party of six to eight people to do the eating. It costs £295.
About 10 minutes after we arrive there is a cheer from the far end of the dimly lit dining room. A small crowd is gathered, cameraphones aloft. I wander down to find them recording the portioning up of their piglet, plumes of steam rising from the chopping board as Montoya works the cleaver over the meat. The legs go one way, the snout another. I take a few pictures, but end up feeling like an interloper at the celebration of a stranger’s birthday. I am not friends with these people. I cannot share their piglet. Well, in truth, I probably could have done if I’d asked nicely. I could have told them I was Grace Dent and they’d instantly have told me to fill my boots. I can rock a leopard-print wrap dress, me. The point is that, the most diverting item on the menu here at Sarap (which means delicious) is the one I can’t order. Still, there are a bunch of other things available and by the end of the night, following the beguiling instructions of our waiter, I will have tried all but one of them. Montoya has been on a long and twisting journey to get here, both figuratively and literally. He only started cooking professionally when he arrived in the UK in 2012 from Australia. He worked at Restaurant Story, Foley’s and the Dean Street Townhouse, while all the time nurturing a desire to interrogate his family’s favourite dishes. It began with a supper club which led in turn to various pop ups, and then a casual place in Brixton Market.
Now he has taken over this spot on Heddon Street, which has become a bit of an incubator for new restaurant ventures; previously, it was home to the rugged nose-to-tail Italian Manteca, which has moved on to Shoreditch. Montoya describes what he is doing here as delivering authentic flavours “proudly inauthentically”, a thoroughly engaging term I first came across in chef Ravinder Bhogal’s Jikoni cookbook. It’s a short menu. Our enthusiastic waiter tells us we should order three starters between the two of us. There are only three starters. The food here strikes me as a softer, often warmer version of the sharp, sweet and salty flavours I am used to from elsewhere in southeast Asia. Pearly pieces of seabass are cured in a soft sour coconut vinegar. There is a gel made from calamansi, or Philippine lemon, and for crunch there are pieces of cucumber. It’s all bright and refreshing. In the mellifluously named Ensaladang Talong it is the addition of crumbled salted duck egg which shifts a rough smoked aubergine purée and slices of tomato away from the Mediterranean. But the most compelling dish, because it nods towards the lechon, is a boned out, rice-stuffed pig’s trotter, with skin that is hinged in a remarkable place between crisp and chewy. It feels a little like a consolation prize for not being able to give the piglet a seeing to. It’s a good consolation prize.
There are four main courses. We are told we should order three. The most diverting are the hunks of roasted celeriac in a ripe, creamy peanut sauce, with the lightest waft of truffle. Poussin has been marinated in lemongrass, citrus and vinegar before being grilled over charcoal to produce the kind of savoury blackened skin which gives point to these small, often flavourless birds. Finally, there are rosy slices of beef, in a thick citrus and soy sauce. It’s very good beef indeed, though the £25 charged for four less-than-vast slices is ambitious. (Amusingly, they plated six slices of the beef for the dish prepared for the photographer who visited a few days later.) Still, we have a bowl of rice with which to absorb the gorgeous liquor. These are I think, all meant to be showstoppers. Intriguingly, the most thrilling dish is actually a simple side of kale braised for hours in coconut milk, ginger, garlic and chilli. It is both comforting and a wake up; an intense, rich vegan stew which I wanted to lean over and focus on. At £6 it also feels like the best moment of value on the menu, for we are just off Regent Street and that is rarely a cheap place in which to be. I am amused by what feels like blatant upselling by our waiter at the start, however encouragingly done. It does mean the bill mounts. Then again, we do not finish up over fed. Desserts are solid and sustaining rather than light and refreshing: a mildly rubbery cassava cheesecake with coconut milk; a log of sweetened glutinous rice with a coconut caramel. Those aside, I like Sarap Bistro very much. The food is unfamiliar in a good way and the execution is precise. It just seems unfortunate that lechon which, for good or ill, is the Philippine’s most famous dish, is not available to individual punters. Without a way to access that roast piglet it makes the experience feel a little like the culinary equivalent of Hamlet without the prince, or Jaws without the shark. Or maybe it’s just that it forces me to confront the fact that I don’t have enough friends; or at least not the kind of friends happy to help me demolish a piglet.

6028;6028;The Observer view on UK politics in 2022 | Observer editorial;2022-01-02T06:00:10Z;['Observer editorial'];['Conservatives', 'Labour', 'Boris Johnson', 'Keir Starmer', 'Politics'];"The contrast between the upbeat tone of the prime minister’s new year message and the political cloud hanging over him as he goes into 2022 could not be starker. Boris Johnson said Britain is in an “incomparably better” state in the fight against Covid than it was at the start of 2021; thanks to the scientific research that produced a vaccine in less than a year, that is certainly true. But Johnson begins the new year as an irrevocably weakened political figure, his poll ratings significantly down from a year ago, his authority within his own parliamentary party eroded. Just two years after winning a decisive parliamentary majority of 80, this will be the year that requires him to fight for his survival. While 2022 will hopefully bring a diminishing of the disruption and harm caused by Covid, it will also see the launch of the independent inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic. Johnson’s dreadful errors of judgment over the last 21 months will be raked over: his decisions to hang back in introducing social restrictions not once, not twice, but three times cost too many people their lives, and still more the hardship of living under harsher social restrictions for longer as a result of his delays.
The inquiry may also uncover further revelations about Johnson’s hypocrisy in his approach to enforcing the social restrictions he imposed on the country within his own residence. The Cabinet Office investigation into the Downing Street parties will report and, if it generates evidence that the law was broken, may even lead to a police investigation. Johnson will also continue to face scrutiny over his lack of probity around declaring political donations. The country is facing an acute cost of living crisis that the government has made immeasurably worse through its policies. A decade of tax credit cuts enacted by successive Tory chancellors – which effectively paid for tax cuts for more affluent families – has eroded the incomes of low-paid parents, for some households by thousands of pounds a year. Yet this did not stop Johnson enacting a further tax credit cut of £1,000 a year in October, the biggest overnight benefit cuts for low-income families with children in history. The increase in generosity of the universal credit taper rate the government introduced in November still leaves three-quarters of families on universal credit worse off, and despite the pandemic, unemployment benefits are now at their lowest real rates since 1990. These cuts will hit families living in the constituencies the Conservatives won from Labour in the so-called red wall much harder than those in their heartlands and will make it even harder for families to cope with fast-rising housing, energy and food costs. It is likely that the cost of living crisis – and the lack of government support to help the lower-paid weather the storm – will further damage Johnson in the coming months. The Brexit that Johnson so coveted as a cynical route to the premiership will also continue to throw up difficulties. The key Brexit conundrum remains unsolved: there is no Brexit that involves a complete break with all of the EU’s regulations and institutions that is compatible with both no border in the Irish Sea and no border on the island of Ireland. Given that the UK willingly sacrifices sovereignty in exchange for trade in other trade agreements, it seems extraordinary that this should become the sticking point of principle over which Conservative politicians are willing to undermine the Good Friday agreement. But thanks to the ideologues of the Eurosceptic right, that is where we are. Johnson’s approach thus far has been to pretend this irresolvable dilemma does not exist, misleading the public that the Northern Ireland protocol would involve no customs checks on goods coming from Northern Ireland into the rest of the UK. And the insidious economic impact of Brexit will continue; voters do not need to associate its economic malaise with Brexit itself to hold the government responsible for the state of the economy as we move towards the next election. Voter discontent with the government has translated into a consistentpoll lead for Labour in recent weeks. This creates a window of opportunity for Keir Starmer to position Labour as a government in waiting, one the country can get behind. There have been some important achievements in the first 20 months of Starmer’s leadership. He has begun the journey towards rooting out antisemitism from his party, suspending Jeremy Corbyn from the party after he minimised the findings of the statutory regulator, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, on antisemitism in Labour. He has introduced rule changes that should help ensure future leaders are more appealing to Labour voters. And after a botched reshuffle last May, he has recently promoted promising talent to Labour’s frontbench. What he has not yet succeeded in doing, however, is communicating to voters how Britain would be different under a Starmer premiership. To be fair, this is difficult for any opposition leader to achieve in the first year or two of a new parliament and even harder when there is an ongoing national crisis that has quite rightly dominated the political discourse. But 2022 will be a make-or-break year for Starmer as to whether he can succeed in mustering enthusiasm among voters alongside their growing disenchantment with Johnson. It is far too early to write him off altogether, but we begin 2022 with a glimmer of hope that there may be an end in sight to the corruption, hypocrisy and incompetence of Boris Johnson and the damage his premiership continues to wreak on Britain. That is sufficient to make the new year wishes for good health, wellbeing and prosperity glow with a political optimism that was absent 12 months ago.";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/observer-view-on-uk-politics-in-2022

6030;6030;Eric Adams sworn in as mayor of New York City;2022-01-02T06:00:10Z;['Edward Helmore'];['New York', 'US news', 'Bill de Blasio', 'Democrats', 'World news'];"New York City’s new mayor, Eric Adams, was sworn into office soon after midnight yesterday. It was a fitting time of day for a cop-turned-politico who has indicated that he plans to return some personal panache to a metropolis knocked by a pandemic, political strife and an outgoing mayor whose polling ranks beneath even Donald Trump with state voters. For the moment, Adams’s administration is, as one acquaintance put it, “in the ether”. The Democrat told the city council last week: “We must allow our city to function. We have thrown $11bn at Covid, so the day has come when we need to learn to be smarter.” Adams got right to work. He took the subway to City Hall on 1 January to be at his desk by 8.30am, and held a cabinet meeting half an hour later. Signs are he’ll be more focused than his predecessor Bill de Blasio, who campaigned on raising taxes and spoke divisively of a “tale of two cities”. On Friday, the New York Post described Democrat De Blasio as the city’s worst ever. And that’s with 109 mayors to choose from. The New York Times, nominally friendly, found space to list his achievements only as creating universal kindergartens, eating pizza with a fork, setting a record for tallest mayor and accidentally dropping a groundhog named Charlotte, which later died of its injuries. De Blasio’s major achievement, the Times noted, was spending money – the city’s budget is at a record $102.8bn and its workforce at a 325,000 record high. Yet over the eight years of De Blasio, the city has come to seem slower and more ponderous, as if the mayor were re-making it in his own image. Traffic lights were set for delayed green, confusing the timing of jaywalkers, incensing drivers and perhaps benefiting only angry cyclists. Ubers began clogging up the city where yellow cabs had sped – sometimes without stopping for a fare in a fashion that looked anti-Darwinian. Adams comes with less ideological baggage than De Blasio, whom the Post calls “Cuba-loving” . He is unlikely, for instance, to make his first order of business to try to ban horse-drawn carriages from Central Park and then pointedly allow wealthier sections of the city to go unploughed after a major snowstorm to indicate that he, as a populist Brooklynite, does not consider Manhattan the centre of the New York City universe. He appears, in many ways, more accustomed to the rhythm of the city and its relationship with its commercial reason for being. Business leaders, hoping to stem an exodus of firms and high-earners, say they see signs that Adams will be more focused on economic development and on addressing rising crime levels. He has promised not to restore “stop-and-frisk” policing that unfairly targeted minorities, and to revive a plainclothes police unit to focus on gun crime. A prominent activist, Hawk Newsome, threatened “riots, fire and bloodshed” if Adams restored the unit. Adams replied: “We’re not going to surrender to those who are saying, ‘We’re going to burn down New York.’ Not my city.” He has told business leaders to construct a database to match vacant jobs to jobseekers, adding: “This is going to be a place where we welcome business and won’t turn into the dysfunctional city that we have been for so many years.” But he may find resistance from the city council, centre of New York’s shift to progressive politics. Clashes are brewing over a plan to reinstate solitary confinement at the city’s brutal Rikers Island pre-trial detention complex. “I’m going to ignore them,” Adams said last week. “If they like it or not. I’m the mayor.”
But there are subtleties to Adams’s approach. He loves the nocturnal nightlife scene, looking in on a charity dinner, or a play, before dropping by Zero Bond, one of the city’s new private clubs. “When you’re out at night, it helps decrease crime. It attracts tourists to the city,” he said recently, adding that every time a New Yorker goes to a restaurant “we’re making sure that a dishwasher, a cook, a bartender and a waiter is employed.” It’s a strategy that Serge Becker, nightlife force behind art nightclub AREA, La Esquina restaurants and others, says helped the city reinvent itself in the late 70s and 80s. “Populated streets are safer than abandoned ones. It helped build communities, and Mayor Adams is sending encouraging signals that he has a nuanced view of nightlife – that it has a positive role to play in revitalising the city.” But there’s a question mark over where Adams sleeps. Some say New Jersey, others Brooklyn or that he puts his feet up at the office for a few hours. It seems that he’s happy to keep people guessing. “I’m just as flexible as the city. I’ll be in New York,” he told NY1 in November. “The 24-7 city that never sleeps. We have heard the alarm clock. We are up now.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/eric-adams-sworn-in-as-mayor-of-new-york-city
6031;6031;Letters: securing our food supplies is more vital than diets | Observer letters;2022-01-02T06:00:10Z;['N/A'];['Food', 'Veganism', 'Vegan food and drink'];"There are valid concerns about conventional livestock, but vegans also have blindspots (“No meat please, we’re British: now a third of us approve of vegan diet”, News). Stem-cell meat may feed richer countries some day and less conventional livestock such as snails, mussels and capybara may also help, but dramatic reductions in the impact per head of cattle, chickens, etc, are already possible via changes to feed and additives and regenerative methods. Food security is also crucial. Crops can fail badly but free markets absurdly punish suppliers if surpluses are produced, land is used for short-term gain and there is still no defined responsibility for food security. Failure to restore fish stocks could prove suicidal if crops fail badly because of climate change, pests and diseases. The whole “eat this, not that” approach is the wrong way round; naive idealism and factory farming apologists are opposite sides of the same counterfeit coin. Better supplies must be the priority, with future consumption based on this. Iain Climie Whitchurch, Hampshire Going plant-based prevents animals from enduring miserable lives and violent, terrifying deaths. It’s better for the environment and slashes the risk of suffering from cancer, diabetes, heart disease and strokes. Fortunately, ditching meat, eggs and dairy has never been easier. Vegan options are plentiful in supermarkets, restaurants and takeaways. From plant-based eggs to vegan meat, dairy-free cheese, and ice-cream, the choice is huge and growing by the day. Eating vegan is a compassionate choice that stops suffering and can boost your health. Jennifer White Peta UK, London N1 Publicly fund political parties Michael Savage’s piece about John Caudwell potentially withdrawing financial support for the Tories because he’s disappointed with Boris Johnson raises the question – should anyone be funding any political party? (“Top Tory donor slams Johnson as new poll shows strong Labour lead”, News) Surely the way to indicate our dislike of the direction a party is going is at the ballot box. The idea that individuals or companies influence politics with money is distasteful. The main parties should receive funding solely from public funds so that they are beyond the influence of lobbyists and the wealthy. Should the wealthy have spare money they could over-pay their taxes, or contribute to deprived areas of society rather than trying to influence power. Government should be to the benefit of all members of society. Robert Morgan Harlow, Essex Do unto others… If the individualists are incapable of collectivist engagement then those of us who view this pandemic as a public health issue first and foremost can adopt their libertarian philosophy (“Which philosophy helps us confront the crises that beset us... ‘we first’ or ‘me first’?”, Comment). Therefore, I exercise my right to not teach you, your children or husband or wife or partner who refuses to wear a face mask in class, to not stack the supermarket shelves with the food you want to buy, to not spend my money in sectors you think vital to the economy and beneficial to your consulting role or pension plan or dividend, to not drive your train and any other myriad roles where I serve you. Good luck on your own. Dr Michael Sheard Ingleby Arncliffe, Northallerton North Yorkshire Put vouchers to good use As two of the 500,000 participants in the Covid-19 infection survey, led by the Office for National Statistics and the Department of Health and Social Care, my wife and I have been receiving initially weekly, and now monthly, £50 of vouchers (“Infection survey hands out £210m in high street vouchers”, News). By donating an equivalent gift aided amount to an aid agency we will, over the year of the survey, have recycled £1,000 of the government’s own money back into overseas aid and so done something to mitigate the effect of its cut in funding last year. If all participants in the survey did the same thing the government would have repaid, through us, a quarter-of-a-billion pounds. Negative test results for us (so far) have turned into positive results for developing nations. Cliff Harris Bedford Underestimating Farage David Olusoga is quite right to say that Nigel Farage made himself look a complete idiot over his attack on the RNLI (“Culture warriors sallied forth, only to be defeated by their own ineptitude”, Comment), and not for the first time. But let’s not underestimate him. After all, the Conservative party has allowed his ideology to take it over without the need to fire a shot. Dave Pollard Leicester The decline of insects In David Spiegelhalter and Anthony Masters’ column on whether to trust statistics (“What questions should you ask when you hear a claim based on data?”, Comment), they throw doubt on whether the number of insects are declining as the researcher only looked for articles about decline. I am afraid I am even less reliable as my belief in their decline is based on the fact that when we started holidaying on the west coast of Scotland, we would return with the car plastered with dead insects. Now they are barely noticeable. Only one case, but if they are declining on the narrow strip between Oban and St Andrews, then they could be declining everywhere.

6032;6032;My teenager doesn’t want to see her dad again after we split | Ask Philippa;2022-01-02T06:00:10Z;['Philippa Perry'];['Divorce', 'Family', 'Life and style'];"The question My teenage daughter has been depressed for 18 months. During the past two years, I have been in the process of separating from her dad and their relationship has deteriorated to the extent that when we move apart she says she no longer wants to see him. She is not attending school and is struggling to engage with learning despite it being an important exam year. I have taken a step back and, together with the school, we have allowed her to only go in when she can, maybe for an hour or two. Her father sees this as giving in and allowing her to be “lazy” and says giving her this freedom means she will just take advantage. According to him, she needs more structure and discipline, and she needs to get used to the fact that pressure is a part of life. It feels as if he can’t acknowledge that she is depressed, despite her GP confirming this to be the case. I can see she has started to respond well to having the pressure taken off. My daughter and I have always had a good relationship and she confides in me a lot. Her dad and I have very opposing parenting styles, which is partly what led to us splitting up. He lacks the ability to empathise and listen to her. Unless both her parents believe in her, she tells me, she won’t be able get through her depression, so there’s no point in trying. We are due to move apart soon. In the meantime, how can I help her to believe in herself? Philippa’s answer I think what I’m going to say might be very difficult for you to hear. But I hope for the sake of your child you hear me out. You seem to be so driven and burning to be right that you cannot see that there might be another way of looking at this situation. Now, I might have got this wrong, I have only your email to go on and I am reading between the lines, but it feels as though you may be playing a game of “me-right, you-wrong” with her dad. It almost feels to me as though your child might be a pawn in this fight. I know you are desperate to do your best for your child, but I’m fearful that – unintentionally – you may not be.
You have got the school and the GP on side. I’m fearful that this is like lining up chess pieces to win a game. If you could try to understand your ex’s fears and concerns for your daughter he might be more willing to listen to yours. Your teenager sounds conflicted. On the one hand she very dramatically doesn’t want to see him again, but on the other, she wants him to believe in her, she needs his good opinion. When your ex moves out of the family home, your daughter will lose her dad in her everyday life and from your letter I don’t see anyone focusing on that. I imagine, to her, it might feel as bad as losing a leg. It might feel like she is being convinced one of her legs, that’s held her up all her life, is no good. A greater part of your world when you are a child is your family, your mum and dad. And in lockdown that world will have got even smaller. Imagine what it does to you when that world splits apart in an unamicable way. It’s not as though she’s an adult and can just choose another house share. A child may unconsciously see themselves as part mum and part dad and if one part or both parts say the other one is bad, well it’s not surprising if it makes a child feel uneasy in themselves. Some kids are more resilient than others, but some are sensitive and when their parents argue or appear to hate each other they experience this as trauma. To a child, the only solution their psyche may come up with when parents are warring is to throw in their lot with just one parent. It’s quite complicated to see each one as a mixture of good and bad and so it’s easier to make one good and the other bad. These processes are largely unconscious and when we cannot process our difficult feelings into words it can be a cause of depression. You and your ex-partner have taken up polarised positions. You both need to exercise some give and take to come to a compromise. Your daughter has thrown in her lot with you. And if you describe him to her as somehow lacking, you are in danger of alienating her from her father. Don’t be in league with her against her dad. Her home being in flux and about to fall apart could be a reason she is too distressed and depressed to go to school, as there is a crisis at home. It is not unknown that when parents war a child may become ill. I’m sorry if this is hard to take in and, as I said, I may be reading the situation wrong, but to make sure your split doesn’t exacerbate your daughter’s depression I urge you to make an appointment for the three of you at the Family Separation Clinic (familyseparationclinic.com). This clinic offers a specialist service to families experiencing separation, in particular where a child is rejecting a relationship with one of their parents. Also, I recommend listening to my BBC Radio 4 documentary about parental alienation called When Parents Split, available online.

And as she sets her sights on reaching No 10 one day, we should expect to see and hear much more of her in 2022. Appointed by Boris Johnson as foreign secretary in September, Truss has been frantically upping her profile ever since. Late last year, Russian state media mocked her as “the new Iron lady” after she appeared atop a British tank in Estonia. Then Truss issued a Happy Christmas message to the nation – and the world – via Twitter, posing Queen-like, in front of a giant globe and the union jack. It seems to be working. In a recent ConservativeHome poll of Tory activists, Truss topped the list of potential successors to Johnson, ahead of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. In her new international role, Truss, 46, has been busy playing up her enthusiasm for personal liberty at home and a small state. She also stresses her patriotism and her enthusiasm for Brexit. But it was not always so. Truss was a Liberal Democrat at Oxford University and campaigned against Brexit in 2016, warning it would be bad for freedom and the economy. Now she wants to be ready for a possible 2022 leadership contest in which the votes of pro-Brexit Tory members will be key in determining the final outcome.
Wes Streeting While Labour’s progress under Keir Starmer has at times been faltering, the rise of Wes Streeting has been relentless. Streeting, who was brought up in a council flat in Stepney in the east end of London, was promoted in Starmer’s recent reshuffle to be shadow health and social care secretary, at the age of just 38. After one of his first Commons appearances in his new role, in a debate on more Covid restrictions, even Tory MPs noted his ability, marking him out as a potential future leader. Streeting was educated at a London comprehensive school and was one of the first pupils who had received free school meals to reach Cambridge University. He funded his time at university, where he became Student Union president, by working part-time as a shop assistant. He is also a former president of the National Union of Students. Before being elected to parliament as the Labour MP for Ilford North in 2015, Streeting worked in the charitable, voluntary and private sectors, and as a Labour councillor. He was head of education at Stonewall, the charity for LGBT rights, and is a patron of LGBT Labour. Earlier last year, he had to take time out of politics having been diagnosed with kidney cancer from which he is now recovered.
Heather Hallett The name Baroness Hallett may mean little to most people outside the upper echelons of the legal establishment, but from early 2022 she will be in the news as much as anyone in public life. Lady Hallett, 71, a former senior appeal court judge, who also served as coroner in the inquest into the July 2005 terror attacks on London’s transport network, has been appointed to chair the official inquiry into the Covid-19 pandemic, which begins in the spring. The fact that hearings will be held in public means she will be firmly in the media spotlight. The draft terms of the inquiry are expected to be published early in the new year, after which Hallett will undertake a public consultation – including with bereaved families and other affected groups – before getting the process under way. Organisations representing families who have lost loved ones from Covid have welcomed the appointment of the respected crossbench peer. But they insist that they will be pressing her to uncover the full extent of mistakes by government and the reasons why it and the NHS were so underprepared for the pandemic. Science Robin McKie
Martin Landray Prof Martin Landray, of Oxford University, is co-founder of the Recovery trial, the world’s largest study aimed at finding potential treatments for Covid. Over 46,000 patients have been recruited to the project whose successes have included the discovery of the benefits of dexamethasone, a cheap steroid drug that has subsequently saved the lives of more than a million severely ill patients. Now Landray is expanding those efforts. First, he and his colleagues stand ready to include potential treatments for flu as part of the Recovery project. In addition, he is set to launch Protas, a not-for-profit organisation which will work with the NHS and others around the world to harness the power of large-scale randomised trials to assess potential treatments for cancer, heart disease and dementia. “We have seen in this pandemic just how important clinical trials such as Recovery are in understanding which of many promising treatments are truly beneficial for patients and which, despite hope and expectation, are not. We now plan to apply the lessons learned from that experience to find new ways to prevent and treat other diseases that place huge burden on patients and the NHS.”
Melissa Thorpe Melissa Thorpe has a simple goal for 2022. She wants to put Cornwall on the map – as a space power. She has plans to make the county the first place in Britain to host the launching of a satellite into orbit round the Earth. Later this year a modified 747 jet, run by Virgin Orbit, will take off from Spaceport Cornwall, based at Newquay. It will carry a rocket strapped to its underside and, at a height of 35,000 feet, it will separate from the plane and be fired to propel its satellite cargo into orbit. The probe, Kernow Sat 1, will measure levels of plastic pollution in the ocean. Virgin Orbit has already launched satellites this way – over the Pacific – and has plans to use Spaceport Cornwall as its European base. “Instead of customers having to take their satellites to a rocket pad, Virgin Orbit comes to a site near you to offer a launch,” says Thorpe, a Canadian economist with a background in the aviation industry. At least six other UK spaceports – one in Wales and the rest in Scotland – are set to begin launches over the next few years, with Britain aiming to corner a significant share in the placing of small- to medium-sized satellites into low orbit round the Earth. In the case of Spaceport Cornwall, Thorpe says it is hoped to create about 150 jobs for those working on satellite assembly, programming and data analysis with a further 240 jobs likely to be set up in the supply of goods and providing other services for the Spaceport.
Megan McCubbin Zoologist, conservationist and photographer Megan McCubbin has become a regular stalwart on the BBC’s seasonal Watches series, on which she has worked on with her stepfather, Chris Packham, since 2020. She had stepped in to join the programme when Packham’s regular Cape Town-based co-star, Michaela Strachan, was unable to travel to the UK because of Covid travel restrictions. Since then, McCubbin – who is an experienced wildlife photographer and who studied zoology at Liverpool University – has become the youthful face of conservation in the UK after presenting Springwatch, Autumnwatch and Winterwatch on BBC Two in 2020 and 2021. She is now set to return to our screens with Winterwatch 2022, where she will be stationed at the wetland centre at Castle Espie in Northern Ireland. Arts Vanessa Thorpe
Freddie de Tommaso It is certainly the era of the overnight, stand-in star in the world of live performance, largely courtesy of the virus that has disabled many performers. The problem is now so widespread among casts that those stepping up into lead roles at short notice are no longer even the official understudies. It is a chance that can sometimes mark the start of a long career, of course, as the life of the late Sally Ann Howes showed. The Truly Scrumptious actor from the musical Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, who died last month aged 91, was originally the replacement for Julie Andrews on stage in My Fair Lady. But tenor Freddie de Tommaso, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was already on the radar of many opera fans when he took over the role of Cavaradossi in Puccini’s Tosca at the Royal Opera House earlier than planned a few weeks ago. Since then, the 28-year-old has consolidated his right to the spotlight. The Observer’s music writer, Fiona Maddocks, was not the only one to suggest the rather tired accolade “the new Pavarotti” might actually be justified. De Tommaso came on halfway through the production when American singer Bryan Hymel, suffering with a cold, could not continue. In doing so, he became not only the first Briton to sing the role at Covent Garden in almost 60 years, when Charles Craig sang the part, but also the youngest ever to do so at the famous venue. De Tommaso was also following in the footsteps of Luciano Pavarotti, who made his own debut there as an understudy in La Boheme in 1963.
Liz Kingsman Two of the nation’s favourite small-screen actors, Ruth Wilson and Jodie Comer, are due to make appearances in one-woman shows at the West End’s Harold Pinter theatre this spring – Wilson first in the The Human Voice and then Comer in Prima Facie. And yet perhaps the most interesting speculation surrounds the future of Liz Kingsman, whose own solo effort, which is actually called One Woman Show, is now selling out at London’s Soho theatre. The writer-performer has created an affectionate spoof of the popular new genre of women’s shows inspired, like the triumphant Fleabag, by the personal experience of 21st century womanhood, in all its gory glory and unlikely chaos. Kingsman’s comic parody of the use of the “hot mess” heroine as a dramatic device has been winning plaudits across the board.
Monica Ali Readers who have been drawn into the fictional worlds created by Monica Ali, the writer who came to fame with the acclaimed bestseller Brick Lane in 2003, will soon have a new work to seek out. The author’s much-anticipated fifth novel, Love Marriage, is out in February. It tells the story of Yasmin Ghorami, a medic engaged to fellow doctor, Joe Sangster. As their wedding day draws closer and Ghorami’s parents get to know her fiance’s uncompromising, feminist mother, both families are forced to confront old secrets and ancient treacheries. Ali’s heroine also begins to question what the phrase “a love marriage” really means, when set in opposition to the arranged marriages that are still often the norm in south Asian culture. The book, like Brick Lane before it, is also earmarked for a screen treatment, with Ali adapting a script. World affairs Simon Tisdall
Valérie Pécresse Valérie Pécresse has a fair-to-middling chance of becoming France’s first female president in the spring when she challenges Emmanuel Macron, who is seeking a second term. This prospect came about due to two unexpected developments. First, Éric Zemmour, a racist, Islamophobic TV pundit, threw his hat into the ring. His candidacy looks like splitting the far-right vote that the veteran National Rally (formerly National Front) leader, Marine Le Pen, thought was her own. Second, Pécresse last month became the first woman to lead Les Républicains – the mainstream conservative Gaullist party – after besting other presidential hopefuls such as Michel Barnier, the Brexit negotiator. Pécresse, 54, is no ingénue. She is president of the Île de France regional council, which includes Paris, and was a senior minister during Nicolas Sarkozy’s presidency. She will also face Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, the Socialists’ candidate, in the first round. If Pécresse prevails, her most likely run-off opponent is Macron, who currently leads in national opinion polls but whose support is soft. Pécresse, controversially, has moved to the right in order to neutralise Le Pen and Zemmour. Macron’s advisers worry she could also steal centrist voters on whom he depends.
Xi Jinping Xi Jinping is often described as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. He may also be the most dangerous. Since becoming president in 2012, Xi, 68, has eliminated most internal opposition within the Communist party, in part through anti-corruption purges. He has cracked down on dissent in traditional and online media and limited personal freedoms. His unoriginal “Thoughts” have been written into the party’s constitution and his “China Dream”, a developmental vision, has led to large-scale economic reforms, centralised control of China’s cutting edge technology sector, and the ambitious Belt and Road global investment project. But it’s Xi aggressive foreign policy stance, more than his domestic authoritarianism, that worries western leaders. He has greatly boosted military spending and is building new nuclear weapons. Having crushed democracy in Hong Kong, Xi threatens Taiwan with invasion, even as he asserts China’s sovereignty over the South China Sea and oversees border clashes with India. At this autumn’s 20th party congress, Xi is expected to win an unprecedented third presidential term. But that will not slow him down. Xi is a man in a hurry, intent on making China the undisputed global No 1 and securing his historical place in the party pantheon.
Amy Coney Barrett Amy Coney Barrett’s lifetime appointment to the US supreme court in autumn 2020, on the eve of the presidential election, was celebrated by Donald Trump and his far-right supporters as a watershed moment. Her confirmation gave conservative-minded justices a 6-3 advantage on the court. Democrats found it all the more galling in that Barrett, 49, replaced the highly respected liberal justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in September 2020. In the coming year, the consequences of this shift in power are likely to be sharply felt, most saliently in the case of Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that underpins nationwide abortion rights. Arguments in recent test cases, to be adjudicated by the court in 2022, strongly suggested Barrett will vote to overturn or severely limit abortion rights. Her recent suggestion that women should put their newborn babies out for adoption, rather than terminate unplanned or problematic pregnancies, caused widespread offence. Liberals fear Barrett may also cast regressive votes on other hot-button issues such as same-sex marriage, the climate crisis and voting rights, amid widespread fears that Republicans are planning to steal the 2024 election, as Trump tried to in 2020.

Lourdes Leon Madonna’s daughter Lourdes “Lola” Leon has been in the public eye since she was in the womb. So it’s no big surprise to see her tipped to be one of the big models in 2022. Following in the footsteps of Lennon Gallagher, Iris Law and Kaia Gerber, Lourdes – a trained dancer like her famous mother – has already appeared in campaigns for Swarovski, Mugler, Marc Jacobs and Jean Paul Gaultier. Her poses stand out in their precise choreography and her recent shoot for Paper magazine was on-point in its slinky Y2K stylings. However, Leon has been vocal about not piggybacking on Madonna’s fame (in fact she made headlines for her outspoken roasting of Madonna fans when they flooded her Instagram with geeky comments). The 24-year-old, who first graced the catwalk in 2018, told Vogue “people think I’m this talentless rich kid who’s had everything given to her, but I’m not.” She also believes in the importance of standing out from the crowd, or, in the case of TikTok, the algorithm. “I don’t know if it can go back now because of what social media has done to fashion, but I think that’s what it needs: [to be] based on the individual and how they choose to dress and live their lives,” she told Paper magazine. How very 2022.
Steven Stokey-Daley Despite the pandemic, a flurry of new British designers have found exposure through social media and celebrity endorsements. Since graduating, Liverpudlian Steven Stokey-Daley, who operates under the business name SS Daley, gained exposure by dressing Harry Styles for his Golden music video. His oversize, billowy shirt and hand-embroidered trousers were showcased on Styles, causing the clothes to sell out immediately. Trained at the University of Westminster, Stokey-Daley once described his work as “micro-subversions”. As well as disrupting menswear through his feminine clothes, there’s a modernity to his sustainable, made-to-order business model too. His underlying aesthetic obsession (the British class system viewed through working-class eyes) remains of perennial interest. Consciously uncoupling from the fashion system (he says he was never into fashion as a youngster; “It’s bullshit,” he said), instead he draws from British culture for inspiration: a mood board he shared with Dazed magazine featured Kate Bush, Princess Diana and old Etonite schoolboys.
Saul Nash Virgil Abloh’s death underlined the importance of what the late designer did to streetwear: transforming it into luxury garments and forcing a discussion about cultural expectations and dress codes, in the process. The next generation of designers have weaved Abloh’s philosophy around athleisure into their collections, and none more effectively than Saul Nash. He is a Fashion East (Marine Rose, Dior’ Kim Jones, Grace Wales Bonner) alumni, and Hypebeast magazine called him the “next superstar of sportswear”. Nash combines utility with Abloh’s architectural conceit, which drove all of his designs. During the pandemic, his digital presentations used choreography to express conversations around masculinity, sexuality and weaving in his cultural heritage (raised in London, he has Bajan and Guyanese heritage). This made his collections a talking point above and beyond the clothes. “My work is rooted in metamorphose,” he told Vogue, and we can’t wait to see what he comes up with next.

Leah Williamson In many respects, every England woman football player will be a sporting face this year with a home Euros, which kick-off at Old Trafford and conclude at Wembley, likely to intensify the spotlight. For Williamson, though, this summer could be transformative. With more than 100 appearances for Arsenal, their youngest player to reach a century, the ball-playing centre back has been eased into the Lionesses squad and was primarily left on the bench during the 2019 World Cup despite a title-winning season with her club. Now, though, she is arguably no longer the future of the England back line but its present, with new manager Sarina Wiegman having handed her the captaincy for her first two camps in charge (both long-time captain Steph Houghton and Lucy Bronze are out with long-term injuries) as well as a starting berth. Scheduled to return from a hamstring injury in the new year, should the 24-year-old be fit enough she will likely get her first meaningful stab at a senior competitive international at the Euros and have the opportunity to really test the belief of Arsenal fans that she is one of the world’s best at the back by going up against some of the world’s finest forwards.

Keely Hodgkinson Despite not having Olympic funding at the start of 2021, Hodgkinson wrapped up the year as the surprise leader of a new vanguard of British middle-distance female runners. It was an annus mirabilis for the teenager, who won the European Indoor 800 metres title just four days after her 19th birthday, becoming the youngest British winner of an indoor gold since 1970. It was her first tilt at a major title but even better was to come. A keen swimmer as a child until her father nudged her towards the track, Hodgkinson took Olympic silver at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games in a time of 1min 55.88sec. It was an improvement on that posted in victory by a 34-year-old Kelly Holmes in Athens six years before Hodgkinson was born. It made her the 26th fastest woman in history over two laps of the track. “That record has stood since ’95, is that right?” asked an incredulous Hodgkinson post-race. “And Kelly is a legend of the sport.” Hodgkinson is well on her way to achieving legendary status of her own, having finished the season with victory in the 800m Diamond League final. This year she will go for the track trinity of Commonwealth Games, and World and European Championships glory. BG
Phil Foden Comfortably scaling the exalted heights many predicted even when he was a football-obsessed toddler, the so-called “Stockport Iniesta” already has three Premier League titles, an FA Cup and four League Cups to his name. While many pundits insisted the teenage Foden would have been better served spending time on loan away from Manchester City, the benefits of a daily training-ground education from his manager, Pep Guardiola, and the likes of skilled technicians such as David Silva, Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero are now apparent in a commendably patient and humble player who seems a model of high performance and low maintenance. During England’s run to the final of Euro 2020, Foden was used sparingly until a foot injury ruled him out of the final defeat by Italy, but Ahead of 2022’s winter World Cup in Qatar it seems inconceivable that he will not feature prominently in Gareth Southgate’s plans. “Phil can play in five positions up front,” said Guardiola, when asked about the 21-year-old’s strengths. “He can play in both attacking midfield positions in the pockets and he can play in three positions up front.” Southgate’s dilemma is not whether, but how best, to use a young man of his obscene talents.

Parag Agrawal Twitter’s new chief executive took over in November from co-founder Jack Dorsey and is already making changes to the organisation and the platform. Two senior executives have departed, and the company has been restructured with the aim of making it speedier to innovate. Observers and shareholders have long argued that the service needs to quickly grapple with some long-running fundamental problems: how to clamp down on misinformation and hate speech (without losing its rumbustious appeal); how to make some money (without bombarding users with ads); and how to attract younger users away from TikTok and Instagram (without alienating the older crowd). Last year, the company added an array of new features such as its subscription Twitter Blue service, paid Superfollows, Spaces live audio rooms and fact checking service Birdwatch. The jury is out on the success or otherwise of these innovations but the additions and iterations are likely to continue – a few days after Agrawal’s appointment, with an eye to revamping its messaging features, the company announced the acquisition of Slack-like app Quill. A different order of acquisition is predicted by one pundit, Scott Gallaway, who has suggested Salesforce should reheat its 2016 takeover attempt of Twitter, although last year he suggested that the platform should buy CNN – and that hasn’t happened YET. Last but not least, another item in Agrawal’s in-tray is Donald Trump’s legal challenge to his January 2021 permanent suspension from the platform. A bigly year is in store.
Christel Schaldemose The limbering-up is over: this year legislators will be attempting to land a few punches on the tech heavyweights. In the US, Joe Biden’s new Federal Trade Commission head, Lina Khan, will be trying to curtail Silicon Valley mega-companies with her fresh interpretation of antitrust laws. And Europe has some Danish reinforcements in the form of Christel Schaldemose MEP. In recent years EU efforts have been led by the impressive European commissioner Margrethe Vestager yet her landmark data privacy laws are haphazardly enforced and competition cases have become bogged down in legalese. The EU’s answer is more rules – the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act – to regulate illegal content and improve competition respectively. Schaldemose has been tasked with shaping the former into something which will become law – which has involved wrangling 2,000 amendments. The act aims to crack down on everything from images of abuse to the sale of dangerous products online. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen says the legislation has the potential to be the “global gold standard”. The act should be put before legislators this month, and of course, will also require the agreement of the 27 states and the European Commission. How effective the act is will be determined by the interplay of Schaldemose’s horse-trading skills and the multimillion-dollar leverage of Silicon Valley lobbyists. As Schaldemose told Bloomberg, “We are taking a giant leap forward on regulating platforms, but we’re… not on the moon yet.”
Anu Duggal In a recent round-up by Fast Company of 10 of this year’s rumoured tech IPOs – from online credit facilitator Klarna to gaming communication platform Discord – one factor was common to all: none had a female founder. Predictably, tech bros tend to invest in other tech bros. According to Dealroom in 2021, 90% of European venture capital went to male-only founded companies – a proportion unchanged in five years. But this year a new cohort of investors has the funds to initiate some change. The doyenne of this generation is Anu Duggal. In July her New York-based Female Founders Fund announced its third and biggest pot of money so far – $57m – partly financed by Melinda French Gates. Duggal said they hope to invest in 25 companies. “From day one, we have been committed to building the largest, most powerful network of female operators in technology,” she added. In November, a new German venture capital fund, Auxxo, announced it had $15m to invest in companies where at least 20% of the founding shares are held by women. And in the UK, this year Pink Salt Ventures will begin its second round of funding female-led start-ups. Screen Wendy Ide and Barbara Ellen
Suzanna Son Wholesomely freckle-faced, with guileless blue eyes, surrounded by novelty doughnuts: Suzanna Son makes an instant impression in Red Rocket, the latest film from Sean Baker (The Florida Project). Mikey, the down-on-his-luck adult movie actor who is the film’s central character, is immediately beguiled. And so is the audience. Son, who makes her acting debut in the film released in March , owes her career to that electrifying first impression – she was spotted by Baker on the street in Los Angeles. He told her he liked her look, but at the time nothing more came of the encounter. Then two years later, he invited her to audition for a low-budget movie following the comic misadventures of a narcissist ex-porn star, which was to be shot under the radar in Texas during the pandemic. She jumped at the chance. Son plays Strawberry, a coquettish highschooler who is bowled over by Mikey’s perma-tanned charm offensive. It’s a terrific performance: sparky, fresh and unaffected. In a film which doesn’t skew towards a particularly flattering view of human nature, she effortlessly captures the sympathy of the audience. She also sings, delivering a memorable rendition of N Sync’s Bye Bye Bye in a key scene. Next up for Son is another role which taps into her musical talent: she is starring in The Idol, a new HBO series set in the music industry which is currently filming. Baker, who praised her “dead-on” instincts, predicts a career path which could mirror that of Oscar-winner Emma Stone. WI

Gabrielle Creevy Welsh actor Gabrielle Creevy, 25, is one to watch in 2022. She burned bright in 2021, playing working-class lesbian teenager Bethan in the second series of semi-autobiographical BBC dramedy In My Skin, written by Kayleigh Llewellyn. In this study of love, dysfunction and survival – Bethan’s mother (Jo Hartley) suffers bipolar disorder, while her father (Rhodri Meilir) is a brutal alcoholic – Creevy brings Bethan to defiant, vulnerable life as she navigates school, family and her sexuality. Raised in a council flat in Port Talbot, Creevy won a Bafta Cymru award in 2019 for In My Skin, returning to her shift in a coffee shop after hearing she’d been nominated. With roles including The Pact (BBC One), she’s set to feature in John Madden’s upcoming war drama Operation Mincemeat alongside Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen. Creevy has also been cast as Maggie in the US television adaptation of Lisa Taddeo’s non-fiction bestseller, Three Women. BE
Tahar Rahim Tahar Rahim, 40, a French actor of Algerian heritage, was subtly petrifying in 2021’s BBC One drama series The Serpent as real-life serial killer Charles Sobhraj, who duped, drugged, and murdered western travellers on the 1970s hippy trail. Rahim embodied the stylised menace and thin-skinned resentment of Sobhraj, turning The Serpent into one of the most compulsive and unsettling cult-watches of 2021. A character actor par excellence, Rahim’s career is ripening into one of chameleon-like versatility and uncompromising intensity. He won two Cesar awards for his breakthrough role in Jacques Audiard’s A Prophet (2009), and he’s been Golden Globe and Bafta-nominated for Kevin Macdonald’s 2021 Guantanamo Bay drama The Mauritanian. In 2022, Rahim will appear in Apple TV+’s climate change anthology drama Extrapolations, directed by Scott Z Burns, co-starring Meryl Streep, Marion Cotillard, and Ed Norton.

6034;6034;‘Boys and girls have equal freedom’: Kerala backs gender-neutral uniforms;2022-01-02T05:00:08Z;['Hannah Ellis-Petersen'];['India', 'Gender', 'South and central Asia', 'World news', 'Schools', 'Education'];"It’s break time at Valayanchirangara primary school and the pupils run freely beneath the mango trees and palms. Girls race against the boys, hitching up their knee-length shorts, cargo green for girls and teal blue for boys, as they go. It’s been three years since this small government primary school introduced gender-neutral uniforms for its pupils, and in doing so set in motion a quiet revolution that is now sweeping across the south Indian state of Kerala. “I feel very thrilled and comfortable with the uniform. It’s quite distinct from that of my friends studying in nearby schools. I can play well with this dress,” said 10-year-old Sivananda Mahesh. Inspired by the Valayanchirangara model, more than a dozen schools in Kerala have shifted to gender-neutral uniforms and the state’s ruling Communist party of India has pledged to support the movement being implemented across the state. Several women’s rights groups have also come out in support of the unisex uniform initiative, saying it will help bridge the gender gap. Kerala has India’s highest literacy rate, but there is still a higher literacy rate for men than women and gendered and patriarchal expectations continue to be placed on women in society. However, this initiative to tackle gender inequality at a young age is now facing stiff opposition from a section of Muslim organisations in Kerala, which accuse the schools of forcing western dress on their children and denying girls the right to wear what they deem to be appropriate feminine clothes. In December, a protest rally was organised by the Muslim Coordination Committee in Balussery, a town in north Kerala, when the local secondary school introduced a unisex uniform of trousers and shirts for boys and girls. Prominent Muslim organisations in the state warned the state government against enforcing gender-neutral uniforms in other educational institutions in Kerala, a state that is 26% Muslim, saying it would be un-Islamic for girls to wear trousers. The decision at Valayanchirangara primary came after Benoy Peter, the former head of the parent-teacher association, noticed the difficulties that girls often faced wearing skirts in the playground and while playing sports. The school enlisted the help of a local fashion designer Vidya Mukunda to create a gender-neutral uniform that had “style and elegance”.
The school, which has 756 pupils who are mostly Christian and Muslims, said only one parent objected to the uniform, and after the benefits of the initiative were explained, in particular how it would make it easier for girls to move about comfortably, the resistance was dropped. “When the idea came up, we were worried about the reaction of parents who prefer their girls’ wearing skirts. But we were able to implement it easily and without any protests,” said KA Usha, the school’s former headteacher. Usha said the uniform had not only bolstered the performance of pupils, but parents were flocking to send their children to the school. “Parents are keen to get admission here as the new uniform evoked a lot of goodwill,” she said.
The school has also pushed its gender-equality initiatives beyond uniforms. After concerns that the school materials were filled with content “often in conflict with gender parity”, they created their own gender-neutral textbooks, which are designed to sensitise children to gender equality from a young age. “We made our books with teachers writing the content and a former student doing the drawings. The books carry images of women driving vehicles and men cooking in the kitchen. The books convey the message that no job or task is gender-specific,” said Usha. The school has also designed a new logo with the image of a girl and a boy to spread the message of gender equality. KP Suma, a teacher at the school, said: “Now the boys and girls have equal happiness and freedom. The uniform has boosted their confidence. Gender sensitivity is at the heart of the school, and we are ensuring easy mingling of boys and girls without bothering about gender.” After the successes of Valayanchirangara primary, the state education minister, V Sivankutty, said he was determined to see unisex uniforms rolled out across Kerala. “We are anticipating similar attempts at every educational institution in the state. On its part, the state government is committed to promoting gender equality in education and other fields,” he said.
At Kerala’s Balussery school, the site of the all-male uniform protests this month, the principal, R Indu, said it was students who had heard about the Valayanchirangara experiment who prompted her to evolve gender-neutral uniforms. This year, the school introduced the uniform with approval from the staff council and PTA. Indu said Balussery students who wish to wear shawls for religious reasons were still allowed to do so, and there would be no interference in religious identity. “The opposition against gender-neutral uniforms will not last long. My Muslim neighbours feel nothing wrong with it. Only the orthodoxy is opposing it. My children can do any activity with ease using this uniform,” said V Vivek, the PTA’s president. Many female Muslim students also praised the unisex uniforms on social media. But Jafer Neroth, a leader of the Islamic organisation Sunny Students’ Federation who was leading the protests, said the uniforms were “political tools”. “The government is helping the implementation of liberal ideologies on students and without consultation with religious leaders. Biologically, men and women are different, and it is the denial of diversity,” he said. Sivankutty said the protests from some Muslim groups would not halt government plans to make gender-neutral uniforms the norm in Kerala. “We are unmindful of the protests from the orthodoxy,” he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/kerala-india-boys-girls-have-equal-freedom-promotes-gender-neutral-uniforms
6035;6035;Australia Covid update: positive test rate in NSW hits 20% high as Omicron cases surge;2022-01-02T03:11:47Z;['Michael McGowan'];['New South Wales', 'Coronavirus', 'Infectious diseases', 'Australia news', 'Victoria', 'Queensland', 'Omicron variant'];"The positivity rate for Covid-19 cases in New South Wales has hit a high of 20% as the number of people in hospital with the virus passed 1,000 for the first time since the highly-contagious Omicron variant arrived. On Sunday there were 1,066 people in hospital with Covid-19 – an 18% increase a day after the number had already doubled between Boxing Day and New Year’s Eve. The positivity rate also reached 20.3% on Sunday, meaning one in five people tested had Covid, well above the 5% the WHO deemed an acceptable rate of infection at the beginning of the pandemic.
The state recorded 18,278 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, a drop on the previous two days following a significant fall in the number of tests conducted. NSW Health said that 90,019 people had been tested in the previous 24 hours, down from 119,278 in the previous reporting period. The fall in testing follows frequent urging from the NSW government for people not to line up for PCR tests unless they have symptoms or have been deemed a close contact. The government has also changed its definition of a close contact in line with changes agreed to by National Cabinet last week. “Testing capacity in NSW is currently under enormous pressure and the only people getting a PCR [nose and throat swab] should be those who have Covid-19 symptoms; live in a household with a confirmed Covid-19-positive case; or have otherwise been advised by NSW Health to get tested,” the health department said in a statement on Sunday. “Interstate travellers and international arrivals are not required to have a PCR test and should instead undertake Rapid Antigen Tests, as per the guidelines for the respective states and territories.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
Covid rates continue to rise across the country with 7,172 cases in Victoria and three virus-related deaths, while Queensland reported 3,587 cases. Extreme heat caused the closure of eight of Victoria’s testing sites on Saturday, blowing out queues and test result wait times. Early childhood minister Ingrid Stitt said the state’s health minister would make an announcement on widening access to rapid antigen tests within days. “We will have more to say in the next few days about how we will distribute rapid antigen tests for those who are eligible to use that as a way of ensuring they remain Covid-safe,” she said. Queensland’s chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, said on Sunday that of the state’s current cases there are 112 hospitalisations. In South Australia, premier Steven Marshall announced 82 people were in hospital after the state recored 2,298 new Covid cases from 21,140 tests performed yesterday. Seven people were in ICU. Marshall also said the state had “dodged the bullet with a very vulnerable community” after an outbreak in Port Augusta, where roughly one in five people are Indigenous, appeared to be less serious than previously thought. Tasmania also recorded 404 new cases with three people in hospital and a positivity rate of 26% from 1,542 tests performed. The high rate comes after changes to testing requirements that ask only those with symptoms to get tested. But while cases in Australia continue to reach record levels, there is growing evidence Omicron may lead to milder symptoms. A study from London’s Imperial College found the risk of being admitted to hospital is up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared to those infected with Delta. Of the 112 people in Queensland who are in hospital, only five were being treated in intensive care.
“The issue we are facing is of course that with the degree of contagiousness of this virus, we are going to be seeing very large numbers of cases, even though the severity is clearly going to be less, we are going to see very large numbers of cases and a small proportion of a very large number is still a large number,” Gerrard said. The speed of infections with Omicron across the globe is causing concern for the world’s health authorities, who warn that even a milder variant could lead to health systems becoming overwhelmed. Last week the WHO’s Europe Covid incident manager, Catherine Smallwood, warned that a “rapid growth of Omicron … even if combined with a slightly milder disease, will still result in large numbers of hospitalisations, particularly amongst unvaccinated groups, and cause widespread disruption to health systems and other critical services”. In NSW, there is increasing evidence the state’s health system is wavering under the rate of infections. The health department announced late on New Year’s Eve that in “exceptional circumstances”, frontline workers who are asymptomatic close contacts will be exempt from having to self-isolate for seven days, to avoid disruption to key services, a decision experts labelled evidence of an “extremely desperate situation”. It followed revelations in a leaked memo that revealed St George hospital in Sydney’s south was already planning to fly in nurses in an attempt to deal with staffing shortages and surging Covid cases.";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/02/australia-covid-update-positive-test-rate-in-nsw-hits-20-high-as-omicron-cases-surge
6036;6036;What is aquamation? The process behind Desmond Tutu’s ‘green cremation’ ;2022-01-02T01:23:12Z;['N/A'];['Desmond Tutu', 'Death and dying', 'South Africa', 'Africa'];"The body of Archbishop Desmond Tutu will undergo aquamation, an increasingly popular and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional cremation methods, using water instead of fire. With aquamation, or “alkaline hydrolysis”, the body of the deceased is immersed for three to four hours in a mixture of water and a strong alkali, such as potassium hydroxide, in a pressurised metal cylinder and heated to around 150C.
The process liquifies everything except for the bones, which are then dried in an oven and reduced to white dust, placed in an urn and handed to relatives. Like human composting, a technique of composting bodies with layers of organic material like leaves or wood chips, aquamation is still authorised only in certain countries. In South Africa, where Tutu died last Sunday, no legislation at all governs the practice. First developed in the early 1990s as a way to discard the bodies of animals used in experiments, the method was then used to dispose of cattle during the mad cow disease epidemic, said US-based researcher Philip R Olson. In the 2000s, US medical schools used aquamation to dispose of donated human cadavers, before the practice made its way into the funeral industry, Olson wrote in a 2014 paper. Tutu, who died on Boxing Day aged 90, was known for his modest lifestyle. He left instructions that his funeral ceremony should be simple and without frills. The anti-apartheid hero, whose funeral was held on Saturday, specifically asked for a cheap coffin and an eco-friendly cremation.
With burial space in urban areas worldwide becoming increasingly scarce and expensive, aquamation has obvious attractions. Its advocates say water is a gentler way to go than flames. They also claim a liquid cremation consumes less energy than a conventional one, and emits less greenhouse gases. According to UK-based firm Resomation, aquamation uses five times less energy than fire, and reduces a funeral’s emissions of greenhouse gases by about 35%. Aquamation is also used to dispose of animal carcasses in slaughterhouses, where it is considered to be more efficient and hygienic.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/what-is-aquamation-the-process-behind-desmond-tutus-green-cremation

6040;6040;After sparkling year, investors advised to tone down 2022 hopes;2022-01-02T00:00:02Z;['Jasper Jolly'];['Investing', 'Stock markets', 'FTSE', 'Interest rates', 'Shares', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Investments'];"Too much of a good thing can make anyone queasy – as many will be aware after a week of turkey leftovers. The same applies to the economy and markets, if analysts’ predictions for the year ahead are anything to go by. Sitting around doing nothing (or passive investment) is an admirable strategy in most years. In 2021 it was masterly. London’s stock benchmark, the FTSE 100, ended December 14.3% higher than last January, and in the US buying shares has been even more rewarding: the S&P 500 went up more than a quarter in value. But even though money was apparently so easy to make last year, investors and economists are putting on a show of wariness for 2022. “Investors have enjoyed bumper returns over the past 18 months, but these returns are, in large part, borrowed from the future,” says Joseph Little, chief global strategist at HSBC Asset Management. He thinks a “pay-back period” is in order. Guy Foster, his counterpart at wealth management firm Brewin Dolphin, says 2021’s gains increased at “breakneck pace”, and the best we can hope for is a gentle deceleration rather than a painful crunch. And Emiel van den Heiligenberg at Legal & General Investment Management even mentions the dreaded b-word – “bubble” – even if only to point out that we’re not quite there yet, despite some of the market madness of 2021. Forecasting stock index movements is always a bit of a mug’s game – as the pandemic has underlined – so some limited kudos must go to those who still place their bets publicly. The brave souls who have put their reputations on the line to make forecasts for the year ahead range from Morgan Stanley (S&P 500 down 9%) to Wells Fargo (S&P 500 up 11%) – a sign of the uncertainty among investors.
Credit Suisse is one of the few banks to have nailed its colours to the FTSE 100 mast, predicting London blue chips will gain a fairly measly 7%. Stockbroker A J Bell is even more pessimistic, going for only 4%. Analysts at HSBC and Deutsche Bank predict that economies in the US and Europe will grow at between 3.75% and 5% during 2022. Yet Japan’s Nomura cautions that US growth could slow considerably in the second half of the year. Among those lining up to spoil the party are China’s president, Xi Jinping, who has already turned down the music on his country’s tech tycoons. Sino-experts suggest Beijing is taking away the punch bowl with tighter credit and regulations. Then there is inflation, the dog that may finally be barking after 12 years of conspicuous silence. This time things really could be different: UK consumer prices have risen by 5.1% in the past year and US prices by a scorching 6.8%.
Andrew Bailey at the Bank of England has already done his best Mervyn King impression, raising interest rates just as a slowdown looked imminent (though it may be only a slight, Omicron-related one). Nevertheless, the rate rise is a signal that central banks are really feeling the constant digs about inflation – even if some of the price increases are caused by pandemic disruption rather than widespread wage increases. Stopping the flow of money to the economy while not damaging the recovery could turn into a nail-biting balancing act. “It is devilishly difficult to achieve a soft landing,” says Deutsche’s David Folkerts-Landau. “But it can be and has been done.” Buckle up.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/02/after-sparkling-year-investors-advised-to-tone-down-2022-hopes
6041;6041;6m UK homes may be unable to pay energy bills after price hike, charity warns;2022-01-01T23:58:34Z;['Jillian Ambrose'];['Fuel poverty', 'Energy bills', 'Poverty', 'Society', 'Consumer affairs', 'Household bills', 'Money', 'Ed Miliband', 'UK news', 'Environment', 'Gas', 'Business', 'Commodities', 'Politics', 'Social exclusion', 'Energy industry'];The number of UK households living in fuel poverty could climb to the highest level on record by this spring unless the government moves to soften the blow of a looming record high energy bill hike, according to a fuel poverty charity. Around 4 million homes in the UK were already classed as fuel poor before a surge in global energy market prices triggered one of the steepest ever energy bill hikes in October, but campaigners are braced for a record increase in the numbers unable to pay their energy bills following another hike this spring. The charity National Energy Action warned that the double blow to household bills could cause at least 2 million more homes to slip into fuel poverty compared with the start of 2021, taking the total to 6 million households. This would be the highest level of fuel poverty across the UK since records began in 1996. The looming energy price hike has not yet been finalised by the regulator but Adam Scorer, chief executive of National Energy Action, told the Observer that the number of households in fuel poverty would “skyrocket” in April. This is expected to deepen the UK’s national energy crisis and compound the “year of the squeeze”, predicted by the Resolution Foundation last week, which threatens to trigger a “cost of living catastrophe” for hard-pressed families. Households are already paying record prices to put petrol in their cars, and can expect the cost of consumer goods to rocket as fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions take their toll on major companies. “Those on lowest incomes and in less-efficient homes will not just face financial hardship but intolerable living conditions, ill health and, for too many, a shortened life,” Scorer said. “This is not just conjecture. It will happen and we’ve had enough time to see it coming and act.” Energy market prices climbed steadily over 2021 before leaping to record highs in October and fresh record highs in December. The market rally has fuelled one of the steepest energy price hikes in the history of the UK’s liberalised energy market. Ed Miliband, shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, said: “Working people are being hit by a cost-of-living crisis which has seen energy bills soar, food costs increase and the weekly budget stretched. The government must take urgent action to support those people struggling to pay bills.” Senior officials from the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Treasury and No 10 have met with the industry regulator, Ofgem, and executives from the UK’s biggest energy suppliers in recent weeks to thrash out a plan to avert the looming national energy crisis. No measures have so far been agreed, and further meetings are scheduled for this week. The government’s energy price cap could allow the average energy bill to rocket further to almost £2,000 a year when it is reset in April, from £1,138 in the previous year, to help cover the cost of dozens of failed energy suppliers, according to industry experts. Labour has called for VAT on energy bills to be cut as a first step to help every household this winter, and the party would also “ramp up ambition with our plan to retrofit 19 million homes” to make them more energy efficient and help bring down household bills. “It is a moral and social scandal that fuel poverty exists in modern Britain. But with national leadership, we can beat it – and ensure everyone has the warm, secure home they deserve,” Miliband added. A government spokesperson said protecting consumers was its “top priority” which is why it was keeping in place the energy price cap, alongside schemes such as the £500m household support fund, the warm home discount, winter fuel payments for over-65s and cold weather payments. Meanwhile several Conservative politicians have written to the prime minister, urging him to scrap taxes on rapidly rising energy bills. About 20 Tory MPs and peers have written in the Sunday Telegraph asking for help for consumers facing fuel poverty, including Craig Mackinlay, chair of the net zero scrutiny group of Conservative MPs, former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, and MPs Robert Halfon and Steve Baker. They argue that high energy prices “are felt most painfully by the lowest paid” and suggest VAT on energy bills and environmental levies which fund renewable energy schemes.;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/01/6m-homes-uk-pay-energy-bills-price-hike-fuel-poverty

6043;6043;US judge delivers double setback to Prince Andrew’s abuse case battle;2022-01-01T23:21:08Z;['Edward Helmore', 'Mark Townsend'];['Prince Andrew', 'Ghislaine Maxwell', 'Jeffrey Epstein', 'US news', 'Monarchy', 'UK news', 'Law', 'World news'];"Two of Prince Andrew’s efforts to prevent or stall the progression of Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s sex assault lawsuit against him were blocked on Saturday when a US federal judge ordered the prince’s lawyers to turn over key legal documents, increasing pressure to settle claims before a crucial court hearing this week. Judge Lewis A Kaplan, in a written order, told the prince’s lawyers they must turn over documents on the schedule that has been set in the lawsuit brought by Giuffre who claims she was abused – aged 17 – by the prince on multiple occasions in 2001 while she was being sexually abused by financier Jeffrey Epstein. Kaplan also rejected arguments by the prince’s lawyer, Andrew Brettler, on jurisdiction grounds after they argued last week that the lawsuit should be dismissed because Giuffre, a US citizen, no longer lives in the US. Brettler has called the lawsuit “baseless”. The prince’s lawyers claimed evidence was so strong that Giuffre does not reside in the US that it was pointless to exchange evidence until that question is resolved because it could result in the lawsuit’s dismissal. They argued that Giuffre has lived in Australia for all but two of the past 19 years, has an Australian driver’s licence and lives in a $1.9m (£1.4m) home in Perth, Western Australia, where she and her husband, an Australian national, live with their three children. In a statement, Giuffre’s attorney, Sigrid McCawley, called the request to halt the case “just another in a series of tired attempts by Prince Andrew to duck and dodge the legal merits of the case Virginia Giuffre has brought against him. All parties in litigation are subject to discovery and Prince Andrew is no exception.” Judge Kaplan, in a written order on Friday, noted the prince’s lawyers have requested that “extensive” materials be turned over by Giuffre by 14 January, including documents related to where she has lived. The rulings come before an important case hearing in New York on Tuesday, one day after the scheduled public release on Monday of a 2009 settlement agreement between Epstein and Giuffre that lawyers for Andrew had hoped would protect him from Giuffre’s claims. The developments follow revelations that Giuffre’s lawyers are reportedly claiming they have up to six witnesses linking the duke to his accuser on the eve of the hearing into a civil lawsuit filed by the 38-year-old, in which she accuses Prince Andrew of sexual assault.
In a separate development, Andrew’s lawyers are also reported to have not provided documentary evidence that he has the “inability to sweat”, despite the claim supporting his denial against allegations he had sex with Giuffre. The duke is also said not to have so far named any witnesses to support his alibi that he was in Pizza Express in Woking on the night in 2001 he was accused of having sex with Giuffre. The developments intensify Andrew’s predicament as he faces intense pressure over his friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell. Last Thursday Maxwell, 60, was found guilty of recruiting and trafficking young girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. The verdict, which has no direct bearing on the Giuffre civil action, could increase public pressure for further prosecutions and push men in Epstein and Maxwell’s orbit to settle actions against them. “As to whether Prince Andrew is in greater jeopardy in terms of the civil suit now being stronger there could be some pressure on the court because the public wants to know why the users of these young girls were not held accountable,” former sex crimes prosecutor Wendy Murphy told the Observer. “The public wants a pound of flesh from the rapists – not just the pimps – but the civil suit is all about money and when the right numbers are paid the case will go away, assuming it survives the jurisdictional challenges,” Murphy added. But the duke was barely mentioned during the Maxwell proceedings and his lawyers are likely to seize on testimony from the key witness “Carolyn”, who said it was Giuffre who introduced her to Epstein and Maxwell. Separately, it is reported that Giuffre could be permitted to deliver a victim impact statement at Maxwell’s sentencing. Sigrid McCawley, a lawyer for Giuffre, told the Telegraph on Saturday that she anticipates the court will hear from “many, many other women who were not able to be heard at the trial”. At the same time, government prosecutors have made no indication since Maxwell’s conviction that they intend to prosecute further, either other members of Epstein’s staff or alleged customers of the Epstein-Maxwell sex trafficking conspiracy. Instead, they have given signs that they are closing the book. Last week, prosecutors dropped charges against the two detention guards who failed to check on Epstein the night of his suicide. Lawyers representing Epstein’s former PA Lesley Groff, named in Epstein’s 2007 non-prosecution agreement, have said they have been informed that no criminal charges will be brought against their client. On Saturday, it was revealed that David Boies, lawyer for Giuffre, said Maxwell should have “cut a deal”, a decision that indicates she could have become a state witness in a wider investigation into the elite social circle of Epstein, her ex-boyfriend. Boies told the Times: “She could have cut a very good deal early on but she passed up that opportunity. I think that’s proven to be a fatal mistake.” Giuffre’s legal team have made requests for new information in readiness for a possible longer hearing, including proof of his claim during his infamous Newsnight interview that he cannot sweat. Giuffre had stated that the prince was “sweating profusely all over me” at a London club on a night she alleges they had sex. The duke told Newsnight that her account could not be true “because I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time”. He also said that on the day in question he had taken his daughter Beatrice to a children’s party at Pizza Express in the late afternoon and was at home with his children for the rest of the night. As pressure mounts on the duke, he may be gambling on three outcomes – that the Giuffre case is thrown out after jurisdictional or other challenges, that it fails on its own merits, or that he may never have to pay the price if a judgment is made against him. “International proceedings have so much political content. They may be couched in legal terms, but when you are trying to do something internationally, it’s always political,” Murphy says. “You can say I’ve got a judgement and I’d like it enforced, but for political reasons a foreign country can say that’s nice but we don’t intend to do anything about it. Why would we?” • This article was amended on 4 January 2022. An earlier version said Prince Andrew was “not named during the Maxwell proceedings”. In fact, as we reported elsewhere, he was briefly mentioned in testimony as being a guest onboard Epstein’s private plane. It was also amended on 7 January 2022 to correct a misspelling in two instances of Virginia Giuffre’s surname.";https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/01/prince-andrew-lawsuit-virginia-giuffre-effort-block-rejected
6044;6044;Boris Johnson asks ministers to plan for Covid workplace absences of up to 25%;2022-01-01T22:30:00Z;['Jedidajah Otte'];['Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'Boris Johnson', 'Politics'];"Boris Johnson has instructed ministers to come up with “robust contingency plans” for workplace absences as it emerged that the government is concerned about the impact record numbers of daily Covid infections could have on businesses in the coming weeks. The Cabinet Office confirmed that, despite the accelerated booster programme, public sector leaders have been asked to prepare for a worst case scenario that would see up to a quarter of workers being off work due to high Covid levels in the population. The department claimed that, so far, disruption caused by Omicron has been controlled in “most parts of the public sector”, but acknowledged that public sector leaders have been asked to play through “worst case scenarios” of 10%, 20% and 25% workforce absence rates, PA reported.
Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, is chairing “regular meetings” with ministers to assess how workforces, supply chains and schools are affected as the Omicron Covid variant is sweeping across the country. The department admitted businesses and public services could face further disruption in coming weeks and that Johnson has tasked ministers to test contingency plans and explore solutions that are hoped to save their relevant sectors from bottleneck scenarios caused by a temporarily significantly diminished workforce. The news comes after the Daily Telegraph reported that the government’s work-from-home guidance in England could remain in place for most of January. Barclay said: “As people return to work following the Christmas break, the high transmissibility levels of Omicron mean business and public services will face disruption in the coming weeks, particularly from higher than normal staff absence. “We have been working through the Christmas period to prepare where possible for this, with all departments liaising closely with public and private sector leaders who are best placed to operationally manage their workforces. The best way to combat Omicron is to get boosted and I encourage anyone who is eligible to get boosted now.” Labour said the prime minister had previously gone missing “for days on end” when he should have been instructing ministers to draft contingency plans. Deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “Boris Johnson’s lack of leadership means his government has dithered and delayed, leaving contingency planning to the very last moment. “Boris Johnson should have instructed his ministers to start planning weeks ago, but instead he went missing for days on end. With record Covid infection numbers, the prime minister must immediately get a grip on workforce pressures, keep essential services moving, keep schools open and keep people safe.” A new record of 189,846 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases were logged in the UK on Friday, as the British Medical Association called for further public health measures “urgently to prevent the health service being completely overwhelmed”. On Saturday, England on its own reported a record high daily total of 162,572 new cases. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge and a government adviser, said the actual number of daily cases could be closer to half a million. But the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said new restrictions on freedom in England “must be an absolute last resort”.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/boris-johnson-asks-ministers-to-plan-for-covid-workplace-absences-of-up-to-25
6045;6045;Schools in England told to wear masks in class as fears mount of Omicron surge;2022-01-01T22:30:00Z;['Toby Helm', 'Robin McKie', 'Julie Henry'];['Coronavirus', 'Education', 'Schools', 'UK news', 'Politics', 'England', 'Department for Education', 'Keir Starmer', 'Nadhim Zahawi', 'Boris Johnson', 'Labour', 'Omicron variant'];"All pupils in secondary schools in England should return to wearing masks in classrooms, ministers said last night, as fears grew that the new term could trigger a huge spike in cases of the Omicron variant. The new advice came amid mounting criticism of the government for failing to ensure availability of Covid testing kits in time for the return to schools and workplaces following the Christmas holidays. The Department for Education said the advice was “short-term only to support pupils and teachers as they return to schools this term” and would remain in place until 26 January, when it would be reviewed. However, there are mounting concerns among scientists and in the medical profession that a further rapid rise in infections is possible, particularly in England, where rules on socialising over Christmas and the new year were more relaxed . Yesterday, the number of confirmed cases in England was a record 162,572 cases. A lack of testing equipment is also adding to staffing problems across public services. All state schools have been asked by the government to carry out on-site testing of pupils before lessons begin this week. As ministers desperately tried to avoid sparking a new mood of national crisis with school closures, the education secretary Nadhim Zahawi also announced that 7,000 more air cleaning units would be provided to schools and colleges to improve ventilation in classrooms. In addition many Ofsted school inspections are to be delayed in the first weeks of the new term. With Boris Johnson under renewed pressure over the handling of the pandemic, Zahawi said everything was being done to ensure the education of young people did not suffer again. “The prime minister and I have been clear that education is our number one priority,” he said. “These measures will bolster our support for schools as we do everything in our power to minimise disruption.” The Labour leader Keir Starmer told the Observer that the government’s failure to shore up supplies of tests in response to Omicron’s emergence in November was “unforgivable”.
Starmer said parents should be testing their children at least twice a week to ensure they did not spread the disease to the older and more vulnerable, and it was up to government to ensure that tests were available for them to do so. “Schools return next week, and in the past this has seen Covid spreading among children, who then take it home to their families,” the Labour leader said. “As cases begin to rise in the more vulnerable age groups, so does concern for our elderly population. The government’s failure to prepare means it must now prioritise those who most urgently require tests, until it can get supply back to levels of demand. Labour’s priorities, he said, would be protecting learning, the vulnerable and our emergency services and critical infrastructure. “Schools must stay open, because children have missed out on too much learning already.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the advice on mask wearing. “Face coverings are already advised in communal areas for pupils in year 7 and above. Pupils are accustomed to their use and we are sure the reintroduction of face coverings in classrooms is something that schools and colleges will take in their stride.” Earlier last year secondary school pupils in England were asked to wear masks in classrooms at a high point of infections though this was dropped when they slowed in the spring. Before last night’s announcement, some secondary schools were already taking unilateral action, writing to parents saying masks would have to be worn in classrooms as part of efforts to avoid school closures. In another sign of heightened concern, payouts worth hundreds of pounds are being offered to encourage ex-teachers to sign up to a government-inspired campaign to provide cover to schools hit by high levels of absences. Supply agencies are promising cash or shopping vouchers for anyone who successfully “refers a friend”. Agencies are publicising the “call to arms” with online adverts offering minimum pay rates of about £130 a day. An advert for Axcis Education says: “If you are not interested … but know someone else who might be … we offer up to £250 in shopping vouchers if you refer a friend to us and we place them in the job.” With the full effects of Omicron still unclear, a leading expert on infectious diseases, Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University, said a return to another full lockdown should be ruled out. “There is still no good case for a full lockdown. Lockdowns aren’t a public health policy. They signify a failure of public health policy,” he said.
“If we end up there again, it will be because we didn’t get the public health messaging right, because we failed to protect the vulnerable and because we didn’t order enough test kits – something which should have been attended to at the beginning of the month when it was obvious that Omicron would cause a huge surge in cases.” In an interview with the Observer, Woolhouse added: “This was an epidemic crying out for a precision public health approach and it got the opposite. We did serious harm to our children and young adults, who were robbed of their education, jobs and normal existence as well as suffering damage to their future prospects, while they were left to inherit a record-breaking mountain of public debt.” He added: “More generally, I hope we will quickly learn not to be surprised by new variants and not to respond to each one in an ad hoc fashion.” Dan Poulter MP, a former health minister who also works as an NHS psychiatrist, said it was “unacceptable” that we were now facing testing shortages, which suggested lessons had not been learned. Poulter, a Tory MP, said ministers should ensure there was a permanent reservoir of PPE and testing equipment “as part of a national pandemic response reserve”.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/schools-in-england-told-wear-masks-in-class-as-fears-mount-of-omicron-surge
6046;6046;Like Kobe Bryant, Mané and Salah will shrug off misses, says Jürgen Klopp;2022-01-01T22:30:00Z;['Richard Jolly'];['Liverpool', 'Jürgen Klopp', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Jürgen Klopp believes Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah will follow the example of Kobe Bryant by showing the best can cope with failure and using their misses to spur them on.
Mané has gone nine games without scoring and spurned a golden chance when he blazed over the bar in Liverpool’s defeat at Leicester on Tuesday, while Salah missed a penalty in the Premier League for the first time since 2017. But Klopp, who will not be on the touchline at Chelsea on Sunday after testing positive for Covid, argued that disappointment is something elite sportsmen encounter more often than lesser players because of their bravery in taking responsibility time and again and getting into the positions to miss. He cited how Bryant, who scored the fourth-most points in the NBA, holds the record for most missed shots, 14,481. “Top, top, top-class players deal constantly with failure,” Klopp said. “That’s our life. That’s what you learn pretty early as a footballer. The better you are, the more often you will fail because you come constantly in these decisive moments. “None of us has ever succeeded in all difficult situations. That’s how it is. Kobe Bryant is still the player with the most missed situations in NBA history and he is one of the greatest players ever. “You have to try it. You have to come in these situations and then you can fail. If you fail there, no problem, go again and everything will be fine. That is pretty much the mindset Mo is in and Sadio as well.”
Salah and Mané will make their final appearances before going to the African Cup of Nations but with a very different backdrop. Whereas the Senegalese has equalled his longest drought for Liverpool, the Egyptian has been directly involved in an unrivalled 24 goals in the Premier League this season. As Klopp accepted, Salah rarely needs to respond to major setbacks. “We don’t have a lot of experience with Mo of dealing with ‘crisis’ or whatever because he didn’t have to,” he said. “The penalty just makes him more greedy to score a goal in the game, usually, and if we bring him more often in promising situations then I am pretty sure he would have finished one of them off.” Mané has not scored any of Liverpool’s past 25 goals but does have a propensity to deliver goals in fits and spurts and Klopp is convinced his latest barren run will end. “Sadio has no problem with confidence, but the momentum finishing-wise is not there at the moment,” he said. “Pretty much all strikers have to go through these kind of things. You have to take it from time to time and then it will be good again. It happened to Sadio before and he came out of it. He scored incredibly important goals for us and I’m really positive that he has chances to score [today].”
His belief that Mané is performing well was supported by the footage compiled by one of his backroom staff when he got a welcome surprise on Friday. “One of our analysts knocks on my door and asks if I have two minutes.” Klopp said. “He made a video to show Sadio how much he contributes to our game and how good he is at the moments, how good he is there and in situations. “The intention was to show he should not be too worried that the finishing is not there at the moment. He’s still an incredibly important player for us. That is the view we have on him.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/like-kobe-bryant-mane-and-salah-will-shrug-off-misses-says-jurgen-klopp
6047;6047;Priti Patel vows to curb eco protests and asylum appeals in 2022;2022-01-01T22:04:28Z;['Harry Taylor'];['Home Office', 'Priti Patel', 'Immigration and asylum', 'Protest', 'Politics', 'UK news'];The home secretary has said she intends to crack down on eco protesters and end the “legal merry-go-round” of “spurious” asylum seeker claims in 2022. In a new year video message posted on social media, Priti Patel said she was proud of many things the government had achieved in 2021, such as the launch of its strategy to tackle violence against women and girls. But she said there was “much more to do” this year, including cracking down on eco protesters on the country’s roads, who she said had “caused misery to the law-abiding public”. Patel added that she was committed to tightening asylum laws and stopping crossings over the channel from France, after a year that saw more than 25,000 people reach the UK in small boats. In response the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, and a leading human rights barrister said the government needed to look at its own role in asylum claims. Extinction Rebellion also accused the government of not taking necessary action over the climate crisis and wrongly blaming protesters. Looking ahead to 2022, Patel said it was “vital” the government’s police and crime bill passed through parliament. “The bill will introduce mandatory life sentences for those who kill an emergency worker in the course of their duty and also crack down on the so-called eco protesters on our roads and motorways that have caused misery to the law-abiding public,” she said. “I will also continue to prioritise fixing our broken asylum system. It has been untouched for two decades, but passing our (nationality and) borders bill into law in 2022 will finally give us the powers we need to deliver long-overdue change. “A fairer system deterring illegal entry across the Channel by cracking down on people smugglers and ending the legal merry-go-round of spurious asylum claims is what the British people expect and we will deliver.” Patel also said the streets were safer thanks to a reduction in knife crime, gun crime and murders. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there was an 8% decrease in knife-enabled crime in the year ending June 2021, compared with the previous year. Homicides were also down 11%, it said, while offences involving firearms fell by 6%. All figures were for crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales. However the ONS stressed that patterns of crime over that period had been “significantly affected” by the Covid pandemic and government instructions to limit social contact. Patel said: “Whether it be cutting crime, keeping our country safe from terrorism or controlling our borders, we have a range of plans in progress to deliver for the British people. That is an ambitious programme, but one I will be relentless in delivering as we focus on building back safer in the year ahead.” Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street chambers, said the Home Office needed to review its own role in asylum claims rather than place responsibility on lawyers. “This home secretary, and the government she represents, spend too much time making out that lawyers and legal process are somehow responsible for the broken asylum system,” he said. “The truth is that almost half of all asylum appeals are successful – and the reason for that is a poorly resourced Home Office which blames everyone but itself for shoddy decision-making. The asylum system protects the world’s most vulnerable and we should all focus on doing better by them.” A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said: “This is the action of a government who are clinging on to a model of business as usual that is heading us towards disaster and they would rather imprison grandparents, teachers and priests than face the scale of the changes that they need to make.” Labour’s shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the government had the wrong priorities: “Prosecutions have plummeted, recorded violent crime and antisocial behaviour are up, just 1.4% of rapes are going to court and more victims are being let down. Asylum decisions are down, the backlog is going up, dangerous boat crossings are increasing, and safe, legal routes are being cut. Cooper said that 95% of Windrush scandal victims have had no compensation as yet and added: “The Home Office plan for 2022 should be to put right these deep-rooted problems caused by 11 years of Conservative policies. Instead, this is a Home Office of slogans not solutions so they just keep making things worse.”;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/priti-patel-vows-to-curb-eco-protests-and-asylum-appeals-in-2022
6048;6048;The Tourist review – Jamie Dornan is explosive in this Memento-lite caper;2022-01-01T22:00:05Z;['Lucy Mangan'];['Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Jamie Dornan'];After an … interesting few years on the big screen, appearing in the Fifty Shades of Grey franchise (as the suavely sadistic protagonist – a performance slightly undermined by the actor’s clear desire to climb out of his own skin to get away from it all) and Wild Mountain Thyme (as – well, you wouldn’t believe me if I told you, but do look it up once you’re in your cups), Jamie Dornan is back on the small screen that gave him his breakthrough. Back then, he was compelling as the still, quiet, psychopathic serial killer Paul Spector in The Fall. Now he is equally compelling in a more action-packed role as a character known only as The Man in the new BBC One thriller The Tourist. It is the latest offering from the acclaimed writers of The Missing, Baptiste and Liar, Harry and Jack Williams, and – from the first of the six episodes, the only available for review – it looks set fair to measure up to their past successes. We meet The Man travelling apparently without a care in the world across the Australian outback, until a Duel-ish truck appears behind him and starts trying to push him off the road. This is greeted by The Man less with shock than resignation – our first sign that The Man may not be quite the everyman he seems. He escapes by driving through a stand of trees but his relief is shortlived. The truck cannons into him from the side and he wakes up in hospital with no memory of who he is, how he got there or what his life was like before. Probationary officer Helen Chambers (Danielle Macdonald) is in charge of the case. You would be looking at her a long time before you were reminded of someone who ought to be responsible for an amnesiac man while investigating an unexplained car accident. Her main contribution so far is to let him go to a lunch appointment – according to the details written on a scrap of paper he finds in the clothes he was wearing when the accident occurred – at a diner 30 miles away on his own (and on crutches). The waitress, Luci (Shalom Brune-Franklin), spills lemonade on him. She is helping him to the loos outside when the diner explodes. They look back as smoke and debris fill the air. “Either I have the worst luck in the world,” says The Man, “or someone’s trying to kill me.” “To be fair,” replies Luci judiciously, “I think having someone trying to kill you would be the worst luck in the world.” In the aftermath, as the police tape up the site, they get a beer. “Fuck me, that’s lovely,” says The Man. “I hope I didn’t used to be an alcoholic.” The hour is peppered with humorous, humane moments like this, that keep an otherwise preposterous premise from exploding into smoke and debris itself. The thick continues to plotten with the addition of scenes of a man buried alive somewhere in the outback (not gratuitously choking and awful, but no fun to watch if you’ve a scintilla of claustrophobia in you) with a ringing phone just out of reach, and a disposable camera is discovered at The Man’s crash site with photos of local landmarks, which puts him on the trail of his forgotten self. CCTV shows him buying a T-shirt and stuffed koala at a roadside shack. The shopkeeper told him how to get to the nearest garage and there is the koala – stuffed behind a bin along with a mobile phone. The final scene is him answering its ring. Guess who it is? I’m not going to tell you because it’s well worth watching this fun, stylish and confident caper, which clearly still has numerous twists up its sleeve and characters to play with. The growing friendship between The Man and Helen – and the toxicity of her marriage currently being sketched in – promises to give the drama heart, too. Dornan is on fine form (and everyone who had begun to worry that they had hallucinated his acting ability in The Fall can sigh with relief and pat themselves on the back at the same time) and five more hours of this Memento-lite production should slip down as easily as The Man’s post-bomb beer. Lovely.;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/01/the-tourist-review-jamie-dornan-is-explosive-in-this-memento-lite-caper
6049;6049;Teens and young adults driving record Covid cases in US, health officials say;2022-01-01T21:07:03Z;['Victoria Bekiempis'];['US news', 'Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus', 'Health'];"As the US is seeing record numbers of daily coronavirus cases driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, public health authorities nationwide have said that teens and younger adults are helping fuel this increase. The uptick in Covid-19 among the under-50s coincides with a surge in cases among young children – and a troubling increase in pediatric hospitalizations.
The US seven-day average for pediatric hospitalizations increased 58%, to 334, between 21 December and 27 December. The increase in hospitalizations for all age groups was about 19%. Less than 25% of US children are vaccinated, Reuters reported. In Los Angeles county, adults between 18 and 49 accounted for more than 70% of the coronavirus cases recorded between 22 December and 28 December, according to the Los Angeles Times. The case rate per 100,000 people has surged most quickly in that age range. The county saw more than 27,000 new cases on 31 December, dramatically surpassing the winter 2021 daily case average of 16,000. About 25% of all coronaviruses tests in Los Angeles county are positive, according to the newspaper. Broken down further, data show that infection rates in persons from 18 to 29 are more than eight times higher than one month ago. With adults in their 30s and 40s, there are six times as many cases. “Many of the people in this age group are important members of our labor force … and these are also folks that are very likely to be out and about for recreation,” Barbara Ferrer, the county’s public health director, was quoted as saying. “Often this age group doesn’t experience the worst consequences of increased transmission,” Ferrer continued. “And sometimes that’s made it more difficult for individuals to stay attentive to the need to be vigilant about adhering to all of the public health safety measures.” There are concerns that the US economy and healthcare systems could suffer further in January not because of imposed restrictions such as lockdowns but because there is so much widespread sickness, including relatively mild cases, that staff shortages further hamper commerce and public services. Meanwhile, the infection rate for children between ages five and 11 has doubled. In nearby Orange county, California, adults from age 18 to 44 are driving Covid infections, according to the Times’ report. Coronavirus cases are increasing dramatically among teens and younger adults in southern Nevada. Eighteen to 24-year-olds saw 44.7 cases per 100,000 as of 24 December, an 131% increase from one week prior, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. In Dallas county, Texas, coronavirus cases rose by 76% in one week, according to a 28 December report in the Dallas Morning News. Adults between 18 and 29 comprised almost 25% of these cases. And in the last week of December, one Michigan hospital system reported a 21% increase in coronavirus cases among 21- to 35-year-olds, compared to the preceding week. Michigan hospitals have also reported seeing more patients in younger age groups in December, many of whom are unvaccinated, according to ABC 12 News. “This is also not by coincidence, an age group that remains under-vaccinated in a significant number,” Bob Riney, president of healthcare operations and chief operating officer at Henry Ford Health System, told ABC 12 News. “The vast majority of the Covid patients in our hospitals are unvaccinated.” Chicago-area children’s hospitals saw their greatest increase in coronavirus case numbers and hospitalizations this week, according to one report. “We’ve seen our biggest numbers in since the pandemic started actually,” Michael Cappello, vice chairman of Advocate Children’s Hospital, told NBC 5 Chicago. Allison Bartlett, who teaches about pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Chicago, told the station: “We are seeing twice as many kids in the hospital who are testing positive for Covid than we saw even back in our bad peak in September.” In New York, the state’s top health official warned of a “striking increase” in pediatric Covid-19 hospitalizations. “The risks of Covid-19 for children are real,” said Dr Mary T Bassett, acting state health commissioner. There was a fourfold increase in pediatric Covid-19 hospital admissions from the week of 5 December through the week of 24 December. As case counts in younger demographics grow, officials are girding for yet another winter surge, though possibly a briefer one that previous surges. Columbia University researchers have said that the US could hit its case peak by 9 January, at about 2.5m weekly cases. However, they said, that metric could hit as many as 5.4m, the New York Times reported. The US has seen 54,747,971 Covid-19 cases, and 825,552 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data, since the pandemic hit the US almost two years ago.";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/01/us-omicron-covid-cases-teens-young-adults-children
6050;6050;Manchester United will remain in limbo while uncertainty lingers over Rangnick | Jonathan Wilson;2022-01-01T20:00:03Z;['Jonathan Wilson'];['Manchester United', 'Ralf Rangnick', 'Football', 'Sport'];"A scruffy draw at Newcastle was not the beginning of the end of the Ralf Rangnick era and neither was a disjointed win over Burnley its glorious rebirth. Games against sides in the bottom quarter of the Premier League are not really how Manchester United should be judging themselves – not unless they’re losing them 4-1, in which case it really probably is time for a change. Optimists, though, perhaps could see signs of progress on Thursday: in Scott McTominay’s energy and drive, in Edinson Cavani’s continued sharpness, in the way Jadon Sancho swooped in from the flank for the second goal and the way Cristiano Ronaldo didn’t wave his arms about quite so frustratedly.
Body language, slightly oddly, dominated the post-match discussions. There is evidence from sports psychologists that it does make a difference – but then, it’s a lot easier to look happy and motivated when you’re winning; the real test will come next time United are being outplayed by Newcastle or struggling to break down Norwich. Monday’s game against Wolves, whose last seven games have featured just four goals at either end, may offer a more significant insight. Under Rangnick, United have taken 13 points from five Premier League games and lie sixth, five points off fourth with a game in hand. To that extent their season has been rekindled. But, other than Arsenal, whose away form against top sides is atrocious, they have not played a top-four challenger and, apart from a faltering West Ham, won’t do so until the beginning of March. At the moment, it feels as though United are in limbo, waiting for the real challenges ahead. But then limbo does seem to be club policy at the moment. It felt telling that the Newcastle performance prompted such discontent – both from that body language and in subsequent grumbling; much of it must stem from the sense of uncertainty. Not for the first time, the United board has come up with a solution that leaves nobody clear what the plan is – and these are directors, we know, with a tendency to react to events. Lacking football expertise of their own, they drift where public opinion takes them; Rio Ferdinand banging his hand on a desk in the BT Sport studio can change the entire history of Manchester United. Appointing Ole Gunnar Solskjær as an interim manager to detoxify the club after the dismissal of José Mourinho made sense. Giving him the job on a permanent basis three months later did not, however good initial results had been. Waiting till the end of the season would have given the club two months more evidence on which to base a decision and would have cost nothing; it’s not as though Solskjær was going to dash off and accept an offer from somebody else. United ended up winning only two of the 10 games that remained that season, a run that probably would have led to a different appointment and perhaps spared United the two wasted years that followed. Solskjær as temporary manager made sense; he was a popular club legend and it gave the board time to come up with a strategy. Rangnick as interim may make sense, but only if he is allowed to use this second half of the season to get a feel for the club, to assess the squad and to work out how he can shape it.
But is that what his consultancy role means? Nobody seems to know. If it is Rangnick making decisions on recruitment, nominating a coach to pursue a vision he largely dictates, then this period of research could be extremely useful. But if that is the case, what is the role of the director of football, John Murtough, and the technical director, Darren Fletcher, both of whom were appointed in March? Rangnick is not Solskjær. He is not a living embodiment of the club’s most glorious period, not somebody to pay obeisance to Sir Alex Ferguson and remind players of the best traditions of the club. He is a technocratic outsider with his own clear vision of how the game should be played. Before arriving at United, he had coached only 88 first-team games in the previous decade, preferring to take on a supervisory role in the background – something at which he was hugely successful at RB Leipzig. He was open about disliking the pressure of frontline management at Schalke – and, big club though they are, the scrutiny there is nothing compared with that at United. His football demands intense physical and mental effort. If players think he will be gone in six months, reduced to a distant figure making the occasional phone call to Richard Arnold, Ed Woodward’s nominated successor as CEO, he is probably quite annoying. Then again, if this the way the new United are going to be, finding out which players find the Rangnick method annoying is a useful process.
But there is also an issue of expectation. What is United’s aim for the rest of the season? If this is a fact-finding period before the grand reconstruction begins, then it’s unreasonable to place too much store by results; fourth place may be an aspiration but it cannot be a target. But equally it is understandable if, after eight years of drift, there is impatience among fans, who must look across Manchester and see in City, a club they had patronised for decades, a club that are better resourced, better run and better coached. It could be that Rangnick is the beginning of the process that will narrow that gap. But nobody should be under any illusions of how much work needs to be done. Solskjær’s management was a symptom of the club’s poor decision-making and, because of his status, a mask for it; it was not the cause of the problems.
But the danger is that a lack of clarity stymies the revolution from the start, that, against better sides than Burnley, the frustration that was so evident at St James’ Park spills over into a more general indiscipline and that undermines the Rangnick project almost before it has begun. The uncertainty of Solskjær’s caretaker period was useful; the Rangnick uncertainty – interim coach then ill-defined consultancy – risks being self-defeating.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/01/manchester-united-will-remain-in-limbo-while-uncertainty-lingers-over-rangnick
6051;6051;Doctor Who new year special recap – Eve of the Daleks;2022-01-01T20:00:03Z;['Martin Belam'];['Television', 'Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Doctor Who', 'Fantasy TV', 'Jodie Whittaker', 'John Bishop', 'Chris Chibnall'];"Doctor Who has a history of casting comic actors against type in straight roles – think Frank Skinner, Catherine Tate, even Nicholas Parsons back in the day – but in Eve of the Daleks, you couldn’t help but feel as if guest stars Aisling Bea and Adjani Salmon had been cast to play Sarah and Nick as exaggerated versions of themselves. Indeed, at times (while trying to assemble the means to escape from the junk lying around ELF storage) Bea must have felt as if she was back on Taskmaster. Dan (John Bishop) himself described the situation as Groundhog Day. But given there was only an hour of TV for Chris Chibnall to play with, the device of having the time loop shorten each time around, and the characters having completely free rein in each loop until they died, the end result was rather more Russian Doll than Bill Murray classic.
Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor, in the first of the three 2022 specials that will see her bow out from the role, continued the more commanding form that we saw during the recent Flux series, fulls of plans and direction. She also had to deal with the Daleks finally learning to combat the sonic screwdriver. As an episode it was fine enough, but it was neither the creepy, claustrophobic, being stalked by Daleks extravaganza it could have been, nor a full-on comedy. It fell unsatisfactorily somewhere in the middle, despite the immense chaotic energy Bea brought to proceedings.
In the end, I suppose the message that a “good-hearted weirdo” can still get the girl at the end of a Dalek-infused romcom of death is as appropriate a start to 2022 as we are likely to get. Sum it up in one sentence? The Tardis team and friends face an escape room challenge to get away from Daleks who keep exterminating them in an ever-decreasing time loop. Life on board the Tardis
Yaz (Mandip Gill) has fallen in love with the Doctor! We haven’t just been imagining it. Whether the Doctor is going to reciprocate was left up in the air after Dan’s “My mate fancies you” act. It seems as if he has been scarred by Di’s standoffishness at the end of Flux, and doesn’t want anyone else to miss out on love. There was also some lovely interplay between Yaz and Dan, reflecting that they spent several years stranded together in the early 20th century without the Doctor during Flux. The continuing references to rivalries between Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield might be baffling to the international audience, but when Yaz said there was to be no dissing of her mate, because that was her job, you could feel an evolved relationship. Fear factor There was some social media grumbling before the show – not the Daleks again! It is the third time Whittaker has faced them in a new year special, but then again, it is Doctor Who. It is always going to have Daleks, whose menacing sink-plunger first appeared on 21 December 1963.
The Daleks weren’t especially menacing here, though – certainly nothing like the creepiness we have seen in other recent new year specials – although they did get to exterminate the Doctor more times in one hour than they’ve managed in the previous 58 years. Mysteries and questions Doctor Who festive specials tend to either be continuity-free one-offs, or extremely continuity-heavy leading up to a regeneration. Despite Whittaker’s impending departure, Chibnall opted for the former. We only got brief mentions of the Flux being the reason the Tardis needed a reset, and the events of Flux were the motivation for the Dalek’s animosity to the Doctor this time around. The main mystery, to be honest, was what Sarah actually saw in Nick by the end.
Deeper into the vortex Was that the longest cold open in the show’s history? Sleep No More and The Woman Who Fell to Earth both skipped the opening credits entirely, but I made it 9min and 17 sec before Segun Akinola’s theme-tune arrangement crashed in. It was Nancy Wilson’s 1963 recording of What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve? that opened the programme – coming from the same year Doctor Who first aired. At one point the Dalek said “I am not Nick”. It very much was. Nicholas Briggs has been providing the Dalek voices since 2005. Doctor Who was the seventh most streamed show on iPlayer in the UK in 2021, behind Line of Duty, the Olympics, Pretty Little Liars, Euro2020, Silent Witness and Waterloo Road, which hasn’t been on since March 2015. The BBC say Doctor Who was streamed 41.8m times. That figure isn’t just for the current series – every episode since 2005 is currently available – but it does suggest the important place the BBC still sees Doctor Who having in its drama lineup.
Next time The Sea Devils are back! Looking hilariously true to their original 1970s appearance! We are also going to meet 19th-century Chinese pirate Ching Shih. That airs in spring, and then we will get the end of the Whittaker era in autumn.

6052;6052;Manuel Lanzini doubles up as West Ham survive late scare at Crystal Palace;2022-01-01T19:42:34Z;['Ed Aarons'];['Premier League', 'Crystal Palace', 'West Ham United', 'Football', 'Sport'];"This was the kind of ruthless performance that has defined David Moyes’s second spell at West Ham. In front of a raucous New Year’s Day home crowd and against opponents who clearly fancied their chances of bloodying the noses of their London rivals, two brilliant first-half goals from Michail Antonio and Manuel Lanzini – and Luka Milivojevic’s helping hand – ensured that their Champions League dream remains alive and well despite a late Crystal Palace fightback. Had Jean-Philippe Mateta’s last-gasp volley sailed the other side of the post then it could have been a different story but with more than half the season completed, West Ham find themselves within a point of Arsenal and one ahead of Spurs, albeit having played two games more than Antonio Conte’s side. Anyone who had already written them off after their mini-blip last month may have to think again.
“It was never comfortable but at this time of the year you take what you get,” said Moyes. “I’m thrilled with us getting these results but we need to get back to being mean and not letting teams have opportunities against us.” Patrick Vieira had been given a warm welcome from the home supporters as he returned from his Covid-enforced two-match absence. Yet the hosts had to do without Wilfried Zaha and Cheikhou Kouyaté as both were isolating ahead of their scheduled departure for the Africa Cup of Nations. That meant a return for Milivojevic in midfield, while West Ham welcomed back Declan Rice from suspension. Despite their stuttering form before Christmas, West Ham’s hopes of finishing in the top four should remain realistic as long as Rice is in the side but Moyes will also know finding defensive reinforcements in the January market could prove vital. They should really have found themselves behind inside the first two minutes when Jordan Ayew’s cutback picked out Jeffrey Schlupp but the Ghanaian somehow managed to hit the post from close range. When Ben Johnson was called on to block another effort from Schlupp, it seemed only a matter of time before Palace found the breakthrough. But having weathered the initial storm, West Ham went 2-0 up after some smart finishing from Antonio and Lanzini. There was nothing Vicente Guaita could do about either: West Ham’s top scorer only had to touch Saïd Benrahma’s wicked inswinging cross to divert it in and Lanzini’s goal three minutes later, after a typically surging run from Rice, was an instinctive strike with his third touch that flew past the Palace goalkeeper.
To their credit, Palace kept coming forward and should have pulled one back when Odsonne Édouard let fly after being set up by Ayew, only for his shot to cannon back off the bar. Christian Benteke did at least manage to hit the target twice in quick succession but found Lukasz Fabianski in top form. Yet it was a moment of utter madness in first-half injury-time from Milivojevic that ended any chance of a Palace comeback. The Serbia midfielder probably thought he was being clever when he clearly handled the ball on the blind side of the referee, Darren England, and seemed to have got away with it initially. Unfortunately for him, VAR had spotted that the infringement had taken place just inside the box and it was left to Lanzini to stroke home his second from the spot. Vieira left the pitch at half-time remonstrating with a bemused England and was shown a yellow card after continuing his protestations at the final whistle, even if he later acknowledged it had been the correct call. “You have to give them credit. When they had the chances, they took them,” said the Palace manager. “We had a couple we did not take. We are learning in a hard way.”
An early sighter from Benrahma at the start of the second half could have given Palace even more of a mountain to climb. Ayew – who will now meet up with Ghana’s Afcon squad – was the one constant threat down the right flank and his ball across the area could have given them a lifeline had Édouard been able to direct his shot on target. Milivojevic’s miserable evening came to an end when he was replaced by Mateta with more than half an hour to play, while Antonio went close to doubling his tally with a shot from just outside the box. Michael Olise – another substitute – was the architect of Palace’s fightback when his excellent cross was tapped home by Édouard at the far post before he curled home a free kick to set up a tense finale. But it came just too late to throw Moyes and his side off course.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/crystal-palace-west-ham-premier-league-match-report
6053;6053;UK ministers eager to ease immigration rules for Indian citizens;2022-01-01T19:31:16Z;['Jane Clinton'];['Brexit', 'UK news', 'India', 'Trade policy', 'Politics', 'Liz Truss', 'Priti Patel'];"Ministers are keen to ease immigration restrictions in a bid to make it easier for thousands of Indian citizens to live and work in the UK as part of forthcoming trade talks. The potential offer will be under discussion when the international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, travels to Delhi this month, reports the Times. Relaxing immigration rules for Indian citizens is a key demand from Delhi. Trevelyan is said to have the backing of the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who is keen to curb China’s growing influence in the region. However, they are likely to meet strong resistance from the home secretary, Priti Patel, who opposes the offer.
According to the publication, visa relaxation options under consideration include a scheme similar to one agreed with Australia which would allow young Indians the right to live and work in the UK for up to three years. Another would be to cut visa fees for students and allow them to stay in Britain for a period of time after they graduate. Visa fees for work and tourism – which can cost up to £1,400 – could also be reduced as a sweetener. India has a GDP of about £2tn but it is a protectionist economy imposing significant tariffs on imports. Ministers believe a trade deal with Delhi would provide British businesses with a head start in what is predicted to be the world’s third-largest economy by 2050. It could also see Britain jump ahead as India does not have bilateral trade deals with either the US or the European Union. Ministers are said to be in agreement that a “generous” offer on visas could be the price for such a deal. One government figure told the Times: “The tech and digital space in India is still hugely protectionist and if we could open up even a slither [sic] of access it would put us ahead of the game.” On Friday Boris Johnson said he would “deliver on the promise of Brexit” and create new trade agreements. A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: “India is projected to become the world’s third-largest economy by 2050 and a free trade agreement will open up huge opportunities for UK businesses to trade with India’s £2.25tn economy. “Companies up and down the country can look forward to the benefits, from manufacturers in the West Midlands to tech experts in Belfast, and we look forward to launching negotiations early next year.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/uk-ministers-eager-to-ease-immigration-rules-for-indian-citizens
6054;6054;Stuart Hogg’s late try helps Exeter recover from Bristol fightback;2022-01-01T19:07:56Z;['N/A'];['Premiership', 'Exeter', 'Bristol', 'Rugby union', 'Sport'];"Exeter might have been showing off their new East Stand but this game nearly went west before Stuart Hogg finished it off with six minutes left. First-half tries from Tom O’Flaherty and Jonny Hill plus almost total dominance of possession gave Exeter a 12-3 lead with 10 minutes to go but it should have been double that. Then the game was turned on its head when the Bristol replacement Henry Purdy intercepted Joe Simmonds’ pass on the halfway line and went in under the posts.
The Bears could hardly believe their luck. They had barely landed a punch but were still in with a chance. Exeter had not scored since Hill’s effort on 31 minutes but camped on the Bristol line and Simmonds’ next long pass found its target and Hogg scooted over to settle it. Callum Sheedy’s late penalty did earn Bristol a bonus point which had not seemed likely at half-time. Exeter played with an intensity and zip that has not always been evident this season and may just have turned the corner with the Premiership season around half-gone, but their coaches were dismayed by the lack of killer instinct. “I think the players got nervous,” said the head coach, Ali Hepher. “We had plenty of opportunities, especially at the end of the first half and start of the second, and we tightened up a little bit and made a few errors.” Bristol did lose Charles Piutau after 24 minutes to injury, making them reshuffle the back three, and at the end they had the hooker Harry Thacker on the wing but stayed in the game despite their lineout misfiring.
“We are not far away. We didn’t get a chance to fire too much at the start and at 12-3 down it is about staying in the fight. We did a good job to get a bonus point,” said the director of rugby, Pat Lam. But Bristol are still without a league win since 6 November and this was their fourth Premiership defeat in a row. The new stand is not quite finished but it was open for business as Sandy Park hosted its biggest crowd. Once completed, the capacity will be around 16,000 and this attendance of 14,100 beats even the 2015 World Cup.
The landmark of scoring the first try in the shadow of the new stand fell to O’Flaherty but it was made by his opposite wing Jack Nowell. Nowell came off his flank, after Hill had won a lineout, and popped up in midfield for the ball before kicking it through to the 22. Hogg picked up without breaking stride and put O’Flaherty over. Nowell was sparky thoughout, looking sharp and back to his England best after losing more than 10kg in the past year and Eddie Jones will have taken note. “He has been incredible for us, and I dare say people will be looking at him. Hopefully, he goes back in the international set-up, because that’s where he deserves to be,” added Hepher. On half an hour Exeter went back to type for their second try with Hill taking two tacklers with him over the line after drives from Dave Ewers and Sam Simmonds. It was only 12-3 but it seemed like a chasm with Exeter having more than three-quarters of the ball in the first period.
When Bristol did make it into the 22 after 50 minutes, Exeter kept them out and Nowell turned the ball over on the Chiefs’ line to frustrate the visitors even more. Henry Slade then dived in for an interception on the Bristol line leaving the Bears centre Semi Radrada free to rush upfield in another glimmer of hope for the visitors before the move broke down when the Fijian ignored his support runners. Then Purdy opened the possibility of an away win before Hogg slammed the door shut.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/01/exeter-bristol-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
6055;6055;Is that really me? The ugly truth about beauty filters;2022-01-01T19:00:06Z;['Matilda Boseley'];['Australian lifestyle', 'Beauty', 'TikTok', 'Social media', 'Snapchat', 'Instagram', 'Australia news', 'Body image', 'Technology', 'Augmented reality', 'Health', 'Mental health', 'Health & wellbeing'];"Popping a beautifying filter on the TikTok video she was filming seemed harmless to Mia. It made it look as though she had done her makeup, took away the hint of a double chin that always bothered her, and gently altered her bone structure to make her just that bit closer to perfect. After a while, using filters on videos became second nature – until she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror one day and realised, to her horror, she no longer recognised her own face. “I just felt so ugly … It’s a very scary moment,” she says.
“When you’ve got that filter up all the time … you almost disassociate from that image in the mirror because you have this expectation that you should look like that. Then when you don’t, the self-destructive thoughts start. It’s quite vile the way that you then perceive yourself.” Live, augmented reality filters on photo- and video-based social media platforms including TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat aren’t new but they have evolved from silly hats, puppy dog ears and comically enlarged features to more subtle beautifying effects that may not be immediately obvious to other users. As well as adding makeup, many of the popular filters that have crept into app libraries also change the face’s proportions, generally to fit female, European beauty standards, with thinner faces, smaller noses and plump lips. Mia, who asked for her real name to not be used, says she started using filters when one of her TikTok videos unexpectedly went viral and her audience suddenly skyrocketed.
“I’m a bigger girl,” she says. “At that point, I was around 100kg, so it was really scary for me to have people looking at me.” As her video clocked up more than 1m views, abusive comments started pouring in. “I was getting a lot of hate,” she says, adding: “The filters on TikTok are so smooth and flawless – they don’t always look like a filter. So it felt so easier to use them, just to make me feel a little bit better … but honestly, it doesn’t even look like me. “I was in bed crying some nights about how ugly and disgusting I felt. I’m almost 30! I shouldn’t feel that way … Imagine a 10-year-old using these filters. That’s scary to me.” There isn’t yet a full body of research on the psychological effects of these filters but Dr Jasmine Fardouly, a body image expert from the University of New South Wales, says a study she conducted last year suggests the more unattainable the beauty standard that young people are exposed to online, the more harmful it can be … “It’s promoting a beauty ideal that’s not attainable for you,” she says. “It’s not attainable for anyone, really, because nobody looks like that. Everybody’s faces are being made to look the exact same way. “The fact that it’s harder to know that it’s a filter may potentially be worse for the promoting of those ideals.” When filters are used through TikTok, Instagram or Snapchat’s in-app software, a small label with the filter name appears on the video. While the introduction of these disclaimers, both in traditional and social media, has been a key focus of policymakers, Fardouly says the research so far doesn’t suggest they work. “The research suggests that unless you show people the actual real version of that person’s appearance, it doesn’t seem to make a difference.” There’s a strong relationship between negative body image and the use of photo editing but Fardouly says it’s less clear which direction this correlation flows; whether people’s self-esteem is lower due to the constant augmentation of their images or if those with low body images are more likely to use these features in the first place.
“Body dissatisfaction is an important predictor for eating disorders, and is a predictor for depression and low self-esteem … There is also a link to increased interest in cosmetic surgery.” This is something Amy Hall-Hanson has experienced first hand. The 29-year-old has struggled with body dysmorphia for many years but says she never fixated on her lips until she started using beautifying filters for every Snapchat and Instagram photo she took. “There are a few filters that make my lips look really nice … and it actually made me want to get them done,” she says. “I’ve even played around with overdrawing my lips, and then I’ve stopped myself and gone, ‘Why am I doing this? Like, I’ve never had a problem with my lips before in photos … “I would look in the mirror and my lips would look so much thinner than they probably were in real life … I’ve had to take a little bit of a break from taking photos of myself just to put that buffer in place.” Fardouly says there are no simple solutions – but there are things that social media platforms can do to mitigate potential harm. “I think that the algorithms could be updated to make it so more diversity is being recommended and shown to people,” she says. “The ease [with] which people can use filters [is a problem]. Especially if they’re changing the structure of the face and promoting these unattainable beauty ideals, then it would be helpful to remove those filters from the platforms.” Instagram and its parent company Meta, formerly known as Facebook, have made some moves to limit the use of what they call “face-altering” effects. While their open-source filter creation tool, Spark AR, does allow effects that alter face shape to be uploaded, they will not appear in the “Effects Gallery”, which displays the top effects on the app at that time. Filters that add makeup or smooth skin are discoverable there, and users are still able to use the search function to find face-altering effects. “Effects that directly promote cosmetic surgery are not allowed on Instagram,” a Facebook spokesman says. “We want AR effects to be a positive and safe experience for our community, and we have guidelines for creating and publishing effects using Spark AR. We recognise that creators predominantly use face alteration and feature augmentation to share artistic, playful and fantasy effects, and these effects are a creative way for our community to express themselves.”
Snapchat does not have specific restrictions on face altering or beautifying filters submitted by users through the platform’s “Lens Lab” but a spokesperson for the company says the app’s focus on private, rather than public, communication sets it apart from other social media. “[Snapchat] was created at a time where everyone was curating a ‘perfect’ image of themselves online. Snapchat … is private by default to create an environment where people feel free to authentically be themselves.” The spokesperson says Snapchat has “invested in an in-house sociologist who is tasked with thinking about the impact our product and features have on our community”. “When someone sends a snap with a lens to someone else on Snapchat, the recipient is always shown which lens it is.” TikTok doesn’t allowed users to submit their own augmented reality effects; they are created by the company. The ethics of a number of their beautifying filters, including “faux freckles” or “glow”, have been the subject of intense debate among users. TikTok declined Guardian Australia’s request for comment.
Fardouly says social media companies should not be held solely responsible for the harm caused by unattainable beauty standards. “It’s kind of human nature … A lot of the problems with the platforms come from people’s desires and motivations offline as well. People have always wanted to present themselves positively to others, that’s not new. “It’s just that social media really gives us the tools to control how we appear, and to really spend a lot of time investing in our self-presentation – and that’s where the harm can come from.” For Mia, it came to a head when she was riding in the car with a friend and mentioned that she was considering fat-dissolving injections to try to get rid of her now practically invisible double chin. “He looked at me like I was a crazy person,” she says. “He was like, ‘What are you talking about? You don’t have a double chin.’” After staring at her eerily unfamiliar, imperfect face in the mirror, it occurred to Mia that she was no longer living up to the message she was using TikTok to send in the first place. “Part of my content was about how we should really embrace who we are and what we look like,” she says. “But one day I kind of realised all of that content was a lie and was going to remain a lie as long as I was using filters. “I just woke up one day and went, ‘No, if I’m posting content any more, I’m not posting with filters.’ And I haven’t.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/is-that-really-me-the-ugly-truth-about-beauty-filters
6056;6056;My house was a film set: ‘They were filming sex scenes on our kitchen bench’;2022-01-01T19:00:05Z;['Katie Cunningham'];['Homes', 'Australian television', 'Australian film', 'Film', 'Australian lifestyle', 'Culture', 'Television'];"It’s been more than 10 years since Alex Gaffey’s family home was used as a set for the movie Animal Kingdom, but the house still bears the evidence. “There was a scene that got cut from the film where someone was hacked up by a chainsaw in the bathroom,” Gaffey says. “So there was blood splatter everywhere. And because it was this grey Besser brick, the red food dye and tofu chunks were stuck in the wall.”
“I remember after the film was done, the art directors and assistants were scrubbing it out with toothbrushes and stuff. There’s still a few little spots left where we’re just like ‘oh, that’s Animal Kingdom’.” Gaffey was a teenager when his Melbourne home became the main set for the grisly 2010 crime drama, recruited after a location scout dropped a note in their letterbox. A cast and crew of around 70 spent a month there filming, shooting death scenes while the Gaffey family lived around the happy chaos.
The shoot temporarily transformed the home – and the lives of the Gaffeys. Their furniture was removed and replaced by items sourced by the art department. To prevent continuity errors, the batteries in their clocks were taken out and any props – giant bongs on coffee tables included – had to be left exactly where they were.
When the crew shot at night, the family were put up at hotels. For their trouble, the Gaffeys were paid about $1,000 a week – a relatively small sum as the shoot was on a tight budget. They didn’t mind. “It was awesome,” Gaffey recalls. He remembers running home from school each day, excited to see what they were filming that afternoon – and even snagging work experience on the set. One of his jobs was to run traffic cones outside early each morning, blocking off space for the crew to park their trucks. The Gaffey family aren’t alone: many Australians loan out their properties to big productions. The reason real homes appeal to film and TV crews is simple: “Finding a house that meets the brief is quicker than constructing a set in a studio,” says location scout James Doherty.
Animal Kingdom went on to win an Academy Award nomination and sweep Australia’s AACTA awards. But not every local production is destined for such acclaim – in the mid-2000s, the video version of self-help book The Secret was filmed at the Melbourne family home of then-teenager Tom Pitney. He remembers the windows of their Deepdene home being blacked out, big lights being positioned “everywhere” and hordes of crew members running around. Doors were taken off hinges and fake walls constructed to make rooms look smaller.
As it was for the Gaffey family, their furniture was taken out and replaced. It was an exciting swarm of activity that, miraculously, left no trace. “When they were there, the whole house was trashed,” Pitney says. “And when they left, it was like they were never there.” And for a growing teenage boy, there were other perks: “Being a young kid, the best thing was just the fact that they had catering. So we raided all the food.” Their home’s appearance in The Secret led to it being used for a big-brand commercial and a Foxtel series called Satisfaction, which followed the lives of sex workers in a Melbourne brothel. Pitney has somewhat uncomfortable memories of the latter.
“I was probably mid-puberty and came home after school with Mum and my little brother and they were filming sex scenes on our kitchen bench, which was so awkward,” he says. “They had sex in the laundry too.” Some people invite sex scenes – real ones – to be filmed in their property. In 2010, an all-female pornography company worked its way through Canberra share-houses. This writer was one of those who volunteered their home as a set. “All of our friends were having porn filmed in their house and you got a fee for referring someone else, so it just kind of spread,” my then-housemate Claire recalls.
Our end of the deal was to vacuum, tidy up, leave and not return home until the shoot was over. In return we received $300 a day – a big payday for broke university students. “It was riches – so much money for literally just being out of the house for a day,” Claire says. “When I came back some things were in different spots, which was very disconcerting. A bunch of stuff on my desk was kind of moved around – my Post-it notes and my pens were in different spots. So I guess they’d done some desk stuff.”
Despite the suspiciously rearranged stationery, Claire didn’t have major qualms about the shoot. “It was an all-female production company, so it wasn’t like there was going to be semen in places. I felt like that is really what made it OK.” For more family-friendly productions, sticking around to watch the shoot can even snag occupants a last-minute role.
Cecile Owen had a scene from the Foxtel series Mr Inbetween filmed at her home in the Sydney suburb of Concord – “pure luck”, she says, that followed a letter drop in her street looking for locations. The scene in question featured the show’s central character, hitman Ray Shoesmith, going to visit the home of a man who wanted his pregnant mistress killed.
“Because we have three children, we had scooters and toys all through the backyard,” Owen says. “[The producers] explained what the plot was and said: ‘We’re just going to get rid of everything.’ But then, as a joke, my husband said: ‘Wouldn’t it be funnier if the happily married man actually has kids?’ Because it makes the plot even worse: that he wants to get rid of the mistress and her baby when he has kids already.” “Next thing we know the producers were like: ‘Ah, we’ve got a big favour to ask. Do you think we could borrow your kids? Because we hadn’t thought of that and actually it would be good if we had children in the background while they’re talking in the garden.’” In addition to the $1,000 a day Owen received for the shoot, the kids each got $50 for five minutes of work.
The Gaffey family ended up appearing as extras in a supermarket scene and their dog, Titian, snagged a role over the “professional dog” the crew was going to pay to bring in. Actor Ben Mendelsohn, who played Pope in the film, took a particular shine to Titian. “He loved our dog and claimed ownership of it,” Gaffey says. He’d be like: ‘No one’s allowed to feed her but me. Her and I are on a pure bacon diet.’”
Mendelsohn was a “character”, Gaffey says. “He was definitely the craziest of them all, in the best possible way. He had no filter and was so down to earth. He would hang out with us all the time and bring us food from the catering cart. He’d be like: ‘How was ya fuckin’ day, mate? What’s going on? What are the teachers telling you?’ Then he’d just talk at you.” The Gaffeys’ Ivanhoe East home – a distinctive, mid-century house designed by architect Guilford Bell – became an important part of the film. “[Director] David Michôd wanted to treat the house like a character,” Gaffey says. “It was this grey backdrop, rather than your standard white walls, so it had an energy that matched the dark family that lived there.” Months later, getting to see their home on screen was part of the fun. “It was pretty surreal,” Gaffey says. “Now we have an Animal Kingdom poster up at home.” • The main picture caption and text of this article were amended on 3 January 2022 to correct a grizzly/grisly homophone.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/my-house-was-a-film-set-they-were-filming-sex-scenes-on-our-kitchen-bench
6057;6057;Wave goodbye: the battle to protect Australia’s surf breaks;2022-01-01T19:00:04Z;['Narelle Towie'];['Surfing', 'Western Australia', 'Australia news', 'Oceans'];"There’s a reason surfers like to keep their best breaks a secret. For decades, wave riders have blazed a trail into little-known coastal towns – and in their wake come the planners and developers. When Clint Bryan bought his house 40 minutes north of Perth city, one consideration was paramount: it had to be near his favourite surf break. And sure enough, his Kallaroo home is just five minutes’ walk from the Indian Ocean. The suburb name is a Noongar word meaning “road to the water”. But by the end of this summer, the waves that Bryan built his life around will disappear as the beach is redeveloped for the $252m Ocean Reef Marina. The marina is within the Marmion marine park and will transform 1.5km of coastline into shops, restaurants, boat moorings, a protected beach and new homes. The local state MP, Emily Hamilton, says it will create “thousands of jobs” and inject $3bn into the Western Australia economy. But it will also kill three surf breaks – Mossies, Big Rock and Pylons. The community group Save Ocean Reef says it will mount a legal challenge to the project because it is damaging the marine park, and a petition to construct an artificial reef has grown to nearly 2,500 signatures. Ocean Reef has been a surf destination since at least the 1950s, when it was little more than sand dunes and beach shacks, with just a caravan park nearby. “It’s like we are losing our playing field and the grassroots waves we learned to surf on,” says Bryan, a 43-year-old aviation rescue firefighter. “It’s the end of an era and our group [Ocean Reef Artificial Reef] just wants the opportunity to keep the surf community alive in our area.”
The fragile magic of the break Sean Doherty, the chair of the advocacy group Surf Rider Foundation, says dozens of surf breaks around the country are at risk from development or sand dune work. “The pressure on the coastline is growing,” Doherty says. “For every surf break that is in some kind of danger, it is the result of some development nearby and it takes different forms.” In some places the developments are similar to those proposed for Ocean Reef. On 1 May almost 700 surfers paddled out to protest against the development of eco-cabins, a conference centre and a restaurant on crown land near a surf spot called the Farm in Killalea, south of Wollongong. Opponents say the state-funded development will impinge on a national surfing reserve that was declared in 2009, although the proponents of the development insist it will affect less than 2% of the reserve.
But Doherty says the most endangered breaks now are Narrabeen and South Narrabeen on Sydney’s northern beaches, where construction has begun on a 7m-high 1.3km concrete seawall to save 49 properties, a club and a car park built right on the beach. While the seawall will protect homes from erosion and storm surge, it will also affect the flow of sand.
For waves to form, the movement of sand, which helps shape the seabed, is crucial. Waves break when there is a reef or an accumulation of sand under the water, making it shallow enough for the incoming swell to rise up and form waves. In a natural system, sand blows in and out to sea or is brought in by ocean currents. But Doherty says sea walls, houses and vegetation are increasingly anchoring sand to the shore, taking away the lifeblood of waves. “The magic qualities that make a good surf break are quite ephemeral and quite easily disturbed and changed, often as a result of development,” Doherty says. The foundation says other breaks are also threatened by proposals for seawalls, including at Wamberal on the NSW Central Coast and Byron Bay, nine hours north, where locals have been fighting the suggestion for years. Last year, authorities were forced to install emergency sandbagging and close Main and Clarkes beaches at Byron, where erosion caused by natural processes, development on frontal dune systems and changing weather patterns have wreaked havoc. Further threats to surf breaks in NSW, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia come from climate change, overcrowding and water pollution, the foundation says.
A wealth of benefits In 2010, New Zealand became one of only two countries in the world to legally protect surf breaks (Peru is the other). In Australia, neither state nor federal environment legislation protects waves. Ana Manero, an environmental economist at the Australian National University who researches surfing economics, says the legal gap is a “massive blind spot”, but legislation is not the only way to defend surf breaks. “We don’t have environmental laws to protect surfing resources in Australia, but we have an economic argument,” Manero says. “Surfing brings a wealth of benefits, it makes places more desirable to live in, it is good for the local community, so the question is: when waves are impacted, how is that loss of value going to be accounted for?”
There are an estimated 2.5 million recreational surfers in Australia and surf tourism expenditure was estimated to be about $91bn a year globally before the pandemic. “It’s crucial we understand the real value of surfing before we lose the many benefits it brings, not only for Australia’s surfing community but also for the hundreds of coastal towns where surfing underpins the local economy and lifestyle,” Manero says. For decades, environmental economics has been applied to quantify the value of recreation activities, such as scuba diving and fishing. Manero hopes surfing research will help inform better decisions when developments affect waves. “The problem for policymakers is that surfing’s ‘intangible’ benefits – such as mental health or social connections – are much harder to measure than jobs and retail sales – but I can tell you that they translate into millions of dollars,” she says. Manero says protecting waves does not mean leaving beaches untouched – there are many examples where the building of groynes, piers or sand dredging have improved the quality of waves. At Snapper Rocks on the Gold Coast, a “superbank” was unexpectedly formed after work to remove sand from the entrance to the Tweed River. “During the planning process, if we could put a little bit of brain power into understanding how waves form and the benefits they bring, then we would have a better chance of improving the wellbeing of coastal communities,” Manero says. “It is difficult, but it can be done.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/wave-goodbye-the-battle-to-protect-australias-surf-breaks
6058;6058;A beginner’s guide to snorkelling: ‘Slow down … you see the most amazing stuff’;2022-01-01T19:00:04Z;['Rafqa Touma'];['Fitness', 'Hobbies', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Sydney holidays', 'New South Wales holidays', 'Travel', 'Australia holidays', 'Life and style', 'Australian lifestyle'];"As clouds roll overhead, a salty mist lies low over the timid waves of Manly’s Shelly Beach. Despite grey skies, the protected stretch of sand in Sydney’s northern beaches thrums with locals. “This area is an aquatic reserve,” Damien McClellan, founder of tourism company EcoTreasures, tells our tour group. “If you look behind you, you’ll see sandstone cliffs.” McClellan points across the water to jutting, weathered rock faces, with layered, tan ridges. “Sydney’s sandstone coast is beautiful,” he says. I nod along with the tour group in agreement. We are standing at the headland, looking over bays and beaches lining the coast of Sydney’s north. Cabbage Tree Bay is closest. Sheltered by its reef and rocky geography, the bay does not get pummelled by surf, making it perfect for a snorkel or dive. It is where our tour group is heading for a guided lesson in the former. First, we struggle into wetsuits. Then we learn how to enter the water.
“You’re going to look over your shoulder and walk backwards down the ramp,” McClellan tells us. “Then dunk yourself under.” It is my first time snorkelling. The water has been made murky by recent rains, and I’m nervous about lots of things, including (but not limited to) the possibility of mysterious creatures lurking deep, out of sight. We are fitted with flippers, goggles, and wetsuits. We are also given pool noodles to help keep ourselves afloat, so our flippers don’t disrupt any life on the sea floor.
McClellan says, when fitting snorkelling goggles to your face, to press down until you feel a “suction” around the eyes. He also says to position the strap on the crown of your head, to ensure the goggles are secure enough for no saltwater to get in. But before fitting the goggles to your face, McClellan suggests rubbing a bit of baby shampoo to the lenses and then rinsing with water. This helps prevent your goggles fogging up while you swim. McClellan asks me: “Have you ever looked under the water before? How long did you look for? What did you see?” My answers: Yes (eyes closed, without goggles). Not for long. Not much. “Well, that’s just it,” he laughs. McClellan tells me that “too often”, people forget to pause, breathe, and simply “look” when in the water.
“With snorkelling, you never know what you’re going to see,” he says. “And part of it is relaxing.” He explains that many people snorkel “for the disconnection”. As you focus on your breathing while underwater, you slow down. “When you do that, you see the most amazing stuff.” He is right. With your head and body submerged, all sounds are muted. We float across a sea meadow of thick, flowing kelp and algae which lines the left of the reserve. Translucent blobs called jimble float by. Earlier, a stranger in the change rooms told me to “not worry about those,” because “they won’t sting you”. Big, friendly groupers swim up to our faces and schools of small fish jet past, getting lost in the seagrass. Even on low visibility days like this, if you stay still and let yourself sway with the water long enough, you catch glimpses of purple rock beneath the kelp, unmoving on the seafloor. Once I’m accustomed to the water, my goggles and flippers feel less awkward, breathing through a snorkel becomes less laboured, and swimming comes with ease.
McClellan recalls a German tourist once describing the experience as being among “the lungs of the ocean”. A perfect description, I think. After the guided tour, we return our gear to McClellan. I ask him about future snorkelling lessons, which cost $79 per adult on group tours. It is something I want to come back and do again, next time with my family. He says snorkelling is “easy entry”.
“People get nervous about aquatic activities. But getting nervous is a great human feeling. And snorkelling is a good start at doing something adventurous. “It’s one of those cool activities that generations of family can do together … A lot of adventure activities are strenuous. But kids, parents, grandkids, grandparents can all snorkel.” Plus, it doesn’t take much to start. McClellan says purchasing a “good mask” will cost $80 or less. A wetsuit ranges from $100 to $200; though not essential, it will protect your body from the temperatures of the ocean, allowing you to stay in the water for longer. It will also “last you a decade”, McClellan says. “And the water is free.”
The Cabbage Tree Bay aquatic reserve is McClellan’s top snorkelling spot in Sydney. He says conservation efforts made it so. “It has been a no fishing zone since 2002.” Since then, the area has flourished. The aquatic reserve is home to more than 150 species of fish, including protected and threatened species like weedy seadragons and elegant wrasse. Other aquatic reserves – like Clovelly and Fisherman’s Beach at Long Reef in Sydney – are great spots for beginner snorkellers. Outside of the harbour city, would-be snorkellers should look for spots with calm waters, and ideally some kind of conservation status – protection of marine biodiversity means there is lots to see. “This is an awesome example of good conservation management, and we can do better,” McClellan says of Cabbage Tree Bay. “Natural space like this – it is priceless.” This piece was supported by Destination NSW and EcoTreasures";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/a-beginners-guide-to-snorkelling-slow-down-you-see-the-most-amazing-stuff

Director Mattson Tomlin dusts off an old genre that has had some memorable recalibrations recently, such as Ex Machina, I Am Mother, Blade Runner 2049 and the Westworld reboot.
Chloë Grace Moretz plays Georgia, who discovers she is pregnant on Christmas Eve. Soon androids (which in this future are modelled to look like humans) start raising hell, prompting her to embark on a perilous journey to a safe place in Boston where she can give birth. Action and carnage ensue. When the droids go crae-crae, one assumes humans no longer have an ability to send a Windows error report. The horror! Archive 81 TV, US, 2022 – out 14 January Here comes another new take on a creaky old genre: the found footage production. Loosely based on the popular podcast of the same name, with Australian horror bigwig James Wan on board as producer, Archive 81 follows an archivist (Mamoudou Athie) who, while repairing damaged VHS tapes, pieces together the story of a documentary film-maker (Dina Shihabi) who investigated a dangerous cult. It’s probably best not to expect a masterpiece, as the found footage genre is only occasionally interesting: for every Cannibal Holocaust, The Blair Witch Project or Chronicle, there are a zillion forgettable low-rent productions. But hey, stranger things have happened, as has Netflix’s smash-hit show Stranger Things – one of its directors, Rebecca Thomas, helming four episodes of Archive 81. Honourable mentions: Spider-Man: Far from Home (film, 4 January), The House (TV, 14 January), Ozark season four (TV, 21 January), Munich: The Edge of War (film, 21 January), Snowpiercer season three (TV, 25 January).
Stan The Tourist TV, UK/Australia, 2022 – out 2 January Pulse-pounding action, cliffhanger-filled plotlines and a core mystery involving a character stranded in the outback who cannot remember his own name let alone what he is doing here – now this is a great way to kick off your television watching in 2022. Irish actor Jamie Dornan (AKA Christian Grey from the Fifty Shades franchise) gets plonked in the middle of heat-frazzled Woop Woop, playing “The Man” – an antihero who suffers severe amnesia after being rammed off the road by a psychopathic truck driver. Why are the locals so … mean? And what did he do to deserve such rudeness? All will eventually be revealed after many a twist and turn. Directors Chris Sweeney and Daniel Nettheim establish a foot-to-the-pedal pace that doesn’t let up across the show’s six-episode arc. Gold Film, Australia, 2022 – out 26 January
Jamie Dornan isn’t the only famous, hunky foreigner to be plonked in the arid outback – there’s also heartthrob Zac Efron. Directed by actor Anthony Hayes, who made the very good 2008 Adelaide-set drama Ten Empty, Gold is a survival thriller about a man (Efron) who discovers a big chunk of the good stuff and, of course, executes a plan to keep it. Any outdoors-set film about greedy hard-bitten men pursuing wealth at the potential expense of life, limb and sanity is inevitably compared with The Treasure of the Sierra Madre – which is a little unfair given John Huston’s 1948 film is a rolled-gold (so to speak) masterpiece. We’ll see how Gold stands up, but one thing we know for sure: it will never get old to see good-looking foreign actors left to fry in the Australian sun. Honourable mentions: Upgrade (film, 2 January), The Raid 1 and 2 (film, 4 January), Enemy (film, 7 January), That Damn Michael Che (TV, 12 January), Wolf Like Me (TV, 13 January), The Iron Giant (film, 15 January), Unforgiven (film, 15 January), Melancholia (film, 20 January), Mandy (film, 21 January), He Died with a Felafel in his Hand (film, 25 January), Jasper Jones (film, 27 January), Lantana (film, 27 January). Amazon Prime Video The Tender Bar Film, US, 2021 – out 7 January
The latest George Clooney-directed film is a 70s-set coming-of-age drama presented in a postcard-looking retro aesthetic. Adapting JR Moehringer’s 2005 memoir, Daniel Ranieri plays JR as a child, with Ben Affleck as his Uncle Charlie and Christopher Lloyd as his cranky grandfather. Lloyd has been doing the angry old man shtick for what feels like an eternity; he even seemed old and nutty in the Back to the Future movies despite the actor then being only in his late 40s and early 50s. Shane TV, Australia, 2022 – out 25 January
Any documentary about Shane Warne has a lot of important ground to cover, including the cricketer’s appearance in Advanced Hair advertisements, his fondness for durries and his extraterrestrial-themed reinterpretation of the theory of evolution. Oh, there’s also Warne’s huge influence on cricket and his presence in Australian media as one of our most influential sport celebrities. Amazon Prime Video’s documentary claims it presents an “extraordinary untold story” that offers new ways “to understand the man behind the legend”.
Honourable mentions: F9: The Fast Saga (film, 1 January), Red Dog: True Blue (film, 5 January), Happy Feet (film, 6 January), Hotel Transylvania 4: Transformania (film, 14 January), The Lobster (film, 15 January), The Hitman’s Bodyguard (film, 19 January), As We See It (TV, 21 January), Inglourious Basterds (film, 26 January). Binge Peacemaker TV, US, 2022 – out 13 January
The opening credits sequence of James Gunn’s new superhero series shows the titular hero and others dancing on a soundstage lit up with pink and blue lights. It’s hard to imagine a more fitting scene to summarise Gunn’s approach to caped crusader stories – his party-loving vibes making them feel like fun soirees (see also: Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and the underrated Super). Peacemaker continues where The Suicide Squad finished, even beginning with a “previously on The Suicide Squad” recap. This will limit the show’s broader appeal while satisfying fans of that film in particular. The series fleshes out the hero’s backstory and subsequent adventures, which involve him arguing with random people, evading assassination attempts and hanging out with his pet eagle. The Cleaning Lady TV, US, 2022 – out 5 January An early scene in The Cleaning Lady reveals that protagonist Thony De La Rosa (Élodie Yung), who is working as a cleaner in Las Vegas, is actually a brilliant, quick-thinking doctor. Coming to America from the Philippines, seeking a bone marrow donor for her very sick young son, Thony struggles to make ends meet, fighting for the future for herself and her family. This is difficult enough before she finds herself caught up in organised crime. This show features a very strong performance from Yung, whose presence has a solidifying effect, binding the drama together.
Honourable mentions: Mad Max: The Road Warrior (film, 1 January), Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (film, 1 January), Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts (TV, 1 January), The Constant Gardener (film, 3 January), Searching for Bobby Fischer (film, 5 January), Lost in Translation (film, 7 January), Pulp Fiction (film, 7 January), Saturday Night Fever (film, 8 January), Euphoria season two (TV, 10 January), Last Cab to Darwin (film, 15 January), Flashdance (film, 15 January), The Dark Tower (film, 29 January), American Beauty (film, 30 January). SBS on Demand Araatika: Rise Up! Film, Australia, 2021 – out 26 January
Larissa Behrendt has carved out a niche as an interesting cine-essayist making documentaries that explore subjects highly significant to Indigenous Australian culture – most recently After the Apology, about the continued removal of Indigenous children from their homes, and now Araatika: Rise Up!, which follows a group of NRL players as they create the First Nations equivalent of a haka. The doco gets a tournament movie-esque trajectory when Wesley Enoch, artistic director of Sydney festival, invites Dean Widders and others to perform their soon-to-be-invented dance on a world stage, leaving no doubt as to what the final moments of Araatika will be. It is a film that’s softly uplifting and told with a warming sense of optimism. Delicatessen Film, France, 1991 – out 1 January French directors Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro (AKA Jeunet and Caro) made some amazing films – among them 1995’s The City of Lost Children and also the spectacularly weird and gnarly Delicatessen, a black comedy revolving around a butcher who murders humans then sells them as cheap meat. Grim subject, maybe, but it’s a visual delight from start to finish; if you don’t believe me, check out its innovative opening credits. Honourable mentions: The Apartment (film, 1 January), Angel Heart (film, 1 January), Mud (film, 3 January), Sextortion (TV, 6 January), Crisis (TV, 13 January), Nasdrovia (TV, 13 January) The Place Beyond the Pines (film, 22 January), Sorry for Your Loss seasons 1 and 2 (TV, 27 January). ABC iView ABC iView’s summer binge ABC iView has launched its “Summer Binge” program, with key strands including family, drama and comedy. Movie-wise there’s a wealth of Australian films in particular – highlights include The Mule, Lore and Strictly Ballroom. Plus there’s loads of international titles such as Buried (starring Ryan Reynolds as a man who’s buried alive), Train to Busan (a ferociously good South Korean horror film) and The Florida Project (a moving drama set in and around a crummy hotel not far from Disney World). Disney+ The Big Short Film, US, 2015 – out 7 January Adam McKay’s latest satire, Don’t Look Up, has divided audiences and critics, some seeing it as an unmitigated disaster while others appreciate it as a thinly veiled commentary on the climate crisis. His GFC-themed comedy The Big Short was, for what it’s worth, more lauded and less divisive, celebrated as a fine example of making an accessible film out of dry and potentially uninteresting subject matter. A huge cast – including Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, Melissa Leo, Marisa Tomei, Margot Robbie and Christian Bale – help the medicine go down. Steve Carell delivers one of several memorable analogies when he describes mortgage bonds as “dog shit wrapped in cat shit”. Fantastic Mr Fox Film, US, 2009 – out 7 January Like Adam McKay, Wes Anderson is a big-name director with a new film that has recently hit screens: the charming but slight The French Dispatch. The highly distinctive auteur’s style is even more fastidious in animation than live action, evidenced in his irresistible stop-motion adaptation of Roald Dahl’s famous children’s novel. Fantastic Mr Fox follows the suave titular character (voiced by George Clooney) as he steals produce from his human farmers then deals with the fallout. Honourable mentions: The Simpsons season 32 (TV, 5 January), The Eternals (film, 12 January), The Hate U Give (film, 21 January) Marvel’s Hit-Monkey (TV, 26 January). Paramount+ The Gilded Age TV, US, 2022 – out 26 January
Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has moved from early 20th century Yorkshire to late 19th century New York for his new series The Gilded Age. Many essential elements remain the same: namely a focus on extreme wealth (the show being set in NYC high society) and loads of lovely and lavish costumes. Marian Brook (newcomer Louisa Jacobson, who is Meryl Streep’s daughter) moves to the New York home of her aunts and gets caught up in a war between her family and some very loaded neighbours. Yes: there will be top hats and corsets.

Jump on your bike, charge up the EV, crunch those petrol-driven gears to visit one of Australia’s regional art galleries. And remember to check ahead for Covid-safe entry rules. Geelong Gallery: Archie 100: a century of the Archibald prize On now, until 20 February 2022 The best available paintings in 100 years of the Archibald prize have been gathered together in one exhibition, called Archie 100, and it’s a treat. Mostly the annual Archibald portrait show features a handful of standout works and lots of fair-to-middling ones (and that’s being kind), but for Archie 100 the selection process has chipped away at a lump of rock to reveal a Michelangelo’s David inside. OK, I’m exaggerating, but there’s no doubt that from the original 6,000 portraits, curator Natalie Wilson has given us a superb selection, capturing not just likenesses but most importantly the essence of the sitters. Many of them are not prize winners (because the judges often get it wrong) but iconic images abound, including William Dargie’s Albert Namatjira, Natasha Bieniek’s Wendy Whiteley, John Brack’s Barry Humphries as Dame Edna and a self-portrait with Chuck Berry, of all people, by Vincent Namatjira, Albert’s great-grandson.
If you watched Finding the Archibald, hosted by Rachel Griffiths on ABC TV last year, you’ll know all about it, but nothing beats seeing the real thing. Also on offer are special associated events including late-night viewing on selected Friday nights and a curator talk. Archie 100 is an Art Gallery of NSW touring exhibition, and Geelong Gallery is its only Victorian venue. Ballarat International Foto Biennale Last call for road trippers and locals alike, on now until mid-January, (exact date varies according to venue). This central Victorian city is a sort of outdoor living museum: experience some of the world’s most impressive high-colonial architecture, gradual decline and latter-day resurrection, in real time. It’s all there in the fascinating streetscapes – many of which you can check out while moving between dozens of venues presenting exhibitions as part of the Ballarat International Foto Biennale now extended through to January. Chief among them is the Art Gallery of Ballarat, an imperious reminder of the pretensions of gilded-age worthies’ attempts to transplant the European academy to the antipodes. Solidly in control, conservative and rich, who would have thought the very edifice they built in their own image would one day host three exhibitions of photography, each one presenting a view from below and outside that once was unthinkable.

The working class and provincial Beatles, so pivotal to the changing of the guard that made the British empire instantly old-fashioned in the 1960s, are centre stage in Linda McCartney: Retrospective. Two hundred photographs taken between 1965 and 1997 document pop culture’s heyday and beyond. Iconic faces and intimate family shots feature in a selection curated by the former Beatle Paul McCartney and his and Linda’s daughters Mary and Stella. Hurry, as it ends January 9.
Also on show, the view from the pink parts of the globe that powers both Robert Fielding’s Miil-Miilpa (Sacred) and Anindita Banerjee’s Ondormohol. Fielding, an Aboriginal artist with Afghan heritage, has built an impressive body of work exploring, or rather celebrating, the energising presence of Tjukurpa (the Dreaming) in the lives of his Yankunytjatjara elders and the landscape around his community of Mimili, deep in the APY lands of far northern South Australia. The elders are portrayed in close-up, elegiac black and white photos that capture deep-grained faces vigorous with the inner light of traditional lore. Landscapes are captured in an experimental process that incorporates the sun and earth as elements of the image, over-written with statements of ownership and belonging. Banerjee, from Kolkata in Bengal, India, has been struck by the familiarly evocative high-Victorian architecture of public spaces in her adopted city of Ballarat. Personal connection to both Bengal and Ballarat, two outposts of empire, one crumbling, the other restored to magnificence, prompts questions of how we view “here” and “there” and our relationship to time and the world around us. All three exhibitions provide a nuanced, lively counterpoint to the imperial narrative embodied in the city’s – frankly, often oppressive – architecture of empire, within which their photographs work their transgressive magic. Alice Springs Desert Mob 30: celebrating 30 years of Desert Mob exhibitions. Re-opening January 11 until 1 June 2022. Since 1991 the annual Desert Mob exhibition at the Northern Territory government’s Araluen Arts Centre in Alice Springs has been a showcase for community-based art centres in central Australia. These tiny communities in some of the remotest locations in Australia have been the engine drivers behind a blossoming of Aboriginal desert art into one of the world’s most dynamic contemporary art movements. Invention, risk taking, sheer beauty and an assertive self-confidence rarely found elsewhere – as the world is (at last) acknowledging. And each year the Araluen Arts Centre acquires the best of them for its own collection of desert art. All the big names are included of course, but one of the biggest thrills of Desert Mob is the discovery of unknown artists displaying, “fully formed artistic expression based on deep cultural knowledge and sovereignty”, as Araluen Arts Centre puts it.
Right now until 1 June 2022 you can see the best of the best, a retrospective selection of 50 works from the Araluen’s Desert Mob collection. IMHO there isn’t a more thrilling and exciting collection of recent desert art anywhere in the world – and it encompasses all art forms from carving, printmaking and sculpture to painting, textiles and fibre. Often refreshingly raw and honest, it can be adventurously avant-garde, and great fun too. If you’re looking to take some art home with you while in the Alice don’t miss the selections at Raft artspace and Talapi – two long-established galleries that deal directly with community-based Aboriginal owned and run art centres, so you can be sure of ethical provenance when purchasing. Or come back again in September 2022 and breathe deep the heady perfume of spring gum blossoms in the pristine desert air as you head to the next Desert Mob annual exhibition. That’s your chance to buy from dozens of art centre stalls and the main exhibition too. Matt Dickson is a Hunter Valley-based arts writer.

6061;6061;Easy wins: reminiscing about past friends? The new year is a great time to reconnect;2022-01-01T19:00:03Z;['Rosemary Bolger'];['Life and style', 'Social networking', 'Friendship'];"It’s totally understandable why someone you were once inseparable with might fade out of your life. People move cities, change jobs, have children. Or maybe they embraced the paleo diet while you embraced the cronut craze. Inevitably some friendships are made for a stage of life rather than a lifetime. The forgotten birthdays and missed milestones make it seem all the more impossible to make contact out of the blue. Sure, Facebook tells you they danced at their cousin’s wedding or started a podcast about flightless birds, but liking the odd post is not quite the same.
I’m not suggesting suddenly spamming all your old friends, but some stand out from the past. If you find yourself stalking them on social media (exes excluded) or reminiscing about the good times you had together, that’s probably the best gauge that there’s something there worth revisiting. So if you’re under 40 and the idea of actually talking on the phone sounds terrifying, how about sending them an email or a DM? The new year is a good time to say “Hey, long time no see, how about that pandemic?”
No need to explain the extended silence; it’s safe to assume they feel the same way, so it’s unlikely they’ll hold it against you. There’s no particular script to follow. I prefer to skip the boring stuff like career moves or house upgrades and jump into more important achievements, like mastering the DIY lockdown haircut and coming fourth in the work step competition. Think of whatever bound you together in the first place and you’ll figure out what to say. If in doubt, talk about Squid Game. It could be a one-off interaction, or it could spark a back and forth like old times.

6062;6062;‘Different from’ is correct and ‘iconic’ is meaningless: what I know after two decades as a subeditor | Susan McDonald;2022-01-01T19:00:03Z;['Susan McDonald'];['Language'];"After more than two decades as a subeditor, I know language is alchemy and there’s no exact prescription for good writing. But I also know grammar is central. Meaning can turn on a single word or punctuation mark and a little fine-tuning can prevent ambiguity and inconsistency. Just read this sentence and tell me grammar doesn’t matter: After being whipped fiercely, the cook boiled the egg. Almost everyone has a grammatical pet peeve, and commas attract a lot of attention. When they’re needed, they’re essential – compare “I’m sorry I love you” and “I’m sorry, I love you”. But haphazard or unwarranted commas can be distracting and even misleading. Jonathan Franzen wrote a whole essay on the “irritating, lazy mannerism” of comma-then, as in: “He dims the lamp and opens the window, then pulls the body inside.” I sympathise but I’m personally more irritated by comma-but and comma-too.
The Guardian style guide is clear on the Oxford comma (comma-and in a list); it’s definitely not needed in “he ate ham, eggs and chips”, although an essential distinction between these two sentences: I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis, and JK Rowling. I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis and JK Rowling. But I give punctuation champion Lynne Truss the last word: “Don’t use commas like a stupid person. I mean it.” On non-comma matters, F Scott Fitzgerald thought the exclamation mark was “like laughing at your own joke” and should be done away with, and Milan Kundera claimed he once left a publisher for trying to change his semicolons to full-stops. (I’m a big fan of the semicolon; it encourages the reader to linger a little longer on the thought before it.) And Proust cringed at cliches: “It’s quite true that the sun is on fire at sunset, but it’s been said too often.” Some of my personal bugbears come up more regularly than others. “Compared to” is different from “compared with”. Use the first if you want to liken one thing to another, the second to contrast. And that reminds me: in my book “different from” is correct, “different to” and “different than” are not. “Who” and “whom” are both needed but not interchangeable. The same goes for less/fewer, like/such as and imply/infer. And there’s a simple rule for “that” v “which”: if the sentence needs the (restrictive) clause the word is connecting it to, use “that”, otherwise use “which”. (Some of the grammarati point to an irregular restrictive “which” that can replace “that” but I’m yet to be convinced.) If all of this sounds like so much nerdy nitpicking, I concede some arcane rules are just begging to be bent, although I would still argue you have to have a good reason. The Guardian says it’s fine to split infinitives because “stubbornly to resist so can sound pompous and awkward”. Ditto on ending a sentence with a preposition. And while strictly plural, “data” can take a singular verb, as in “data shows”, because how often do you come across “datum” anyway? Common sense should come into it, and so too aesthetics. Think of how the prose flows. If a sentence is long and inelegant, change it. Sometimes I use an en dash or even parentheses to break up a string of commas. And don’t dangle a verb at the end of the sentence, far from its subject. “How high will emissions from the project proposed for the northern region and the existing plants in the south and west be?” is just ungainly.
Words should sound right too. If you’re torn over whether the possessive of James takes a second S after the apostrophe – James’s – say it out loud. To quote Joan Didion, grammar is “a piano played by ear”. Some words have lost their meaning from overuse. I once edited out three appearances of “iconic” on a single day; “unforgettable”, “infamous” and “emblematic” stepped in admirably. Others become unusable if they’re loaded with an agenda. Politicisation is dangerous. As Orwell said: “If thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.” Language matters. It matters how laws and treaties are written, and whether coal is “phased out” or “phased down”. It matters that news is truthful and that literature inspires. Language reflects – and can even define – who we are. So a little respect, please, for its rules. • Susan McDonald is a news producer for Guardian Australia and a freelance writer";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/01/different-from-is-correct-and-iconic-is-meaningless-what-i-know-after-two-decades-as-a-subeditor

Guardian Australia asked readers to share how the pandemic made them rethink their life. More than 100 reader responses show that emerging from a universally-felt disruption is a new normal. And that new normal looks different for everyone.
Scott, 52, Sydney The pandemic has made me consider working differently. I started my working life in an era where long hours, long weeks, accumulating unused sick days was almost a way of measuring yourself. A badge of honour. Take a tablet and soldier on. I ask myself more now: who benefits from that stoic drive for being productive? I can see moving back to the country and working to live, not living to work. Ara, 50, Perth It has brought into stark relief that I don’t need a lot of stuff to be happy, but I do need connection to people, even if it’s virtual. This has led me to shop less, start working through clearing things I don’t need from my house for it to be more minimalist and tidy. I’ve fallen ever so in love with my local library. Means I read more and spend less on books. I’ve also realised that health is number one. Rosie, 26, Melbourne/Auckland I quit my depressing job two months into 2020 lockdown. A job that was morally and ethically against my values. An environment that affected my mental health and self-esteem … I found a job that I loved within a month and have never looked back. The pandemic pushed me to make my life … meaningful again, and I believe I’m on the right track. I made two films, have a wonderful, loving partner, am living overseas for the first time and have set the bar high professionally. I never want to work for something I don’t believe in, and I have discovered the drive to achieve this.
Ali, 57, Canberra Yes, being largely restricted to my house [during] lockdown left me feeling stiff and sore and old. So I decided to get back into running, something I did some years ago but gave up when I moved houses and lost my routine. Starting very slowly using the Couch to 5k app, I gradually started running again and am now running 4-5km most days. It’s great! I listen to podcasts as I run and it’s a time when I feel free and relaxed. I’m much more mobile and I feel like my body is 10 years younger again! No more sore knees walking up and down the stairs! Sandra, 81, Queensland It has reminded me that it is important to seize the moment, to enjoy what is available for me to enjoy. Enjoy the moment, take my pleasures where and when I can find them. I am doing more cooking and more baking than I have in years and loving it. I have also realised, belatedly, that a relatively solitary existence is just fine, particularly with the companionship of a good dog. Joy, 30, Sydney It has reminded me that the most important things in life are our health, our experiences and our friends and family. Work doesn’t matter so much and it’s not worth the stress. It’s a miracle we’re even here to begin with, so why would we want to spend most of our lives working just to make someone else richer? The standard path of: get a degree/trade, find career, get married, buy a house, have children, retire and then finally be free and travel or do what you always wanted to do … seems like a waste of a human life to me. It’s a never-ending hamster wheel that’s tricking us into chasing things that we think will make us happy, but happiness already exists inside of us. We don’t need to reach any of those levels to attain it. It seems futile.
I now want to focus on enjoying my life and being a better person. I guess I want more freedom in my life and to be less tied down by a career. I would also like to live a more sustainable life so that I am doing my best to leave the planet in a survivable condition for the next generations. I hope we see a massive revolution in the way we work and live that no longer exploits us or the planet. Katie, 48, Sydney It has made me want to pursue work that I actually like to do … I would like to be more in control of my own choices. I walk every morning now with my husband and the dog before work. This has meant we have talked lots, we fight less, it has been great for our marriage! I would love to keep this. Less transport is so much better. Less sitting in a dark, cold office. So much nicer to see the green outside my own house. David, 54, Hobart I found myself wanting to find out more about my own self. I was needing to work out contentment and for me I found that could only come from inside. I starting reading books and I found texts like Intimacy and Solitude by Stephanie Dowrick and Total Meditation by Deepak Chopra. I also Read 1Q84 by Murakami … I find my inner self the most important thing now. I try to engage with the outside world on my terms. Edilia, 63, Sydney I realised that caring for everyone else but not taking care of myself was a really dumb thing to do. I have come to the realisation [that] this is my life and I want to live it differently. It will not be the long-term vision I had prior to the pandemic, but it will allow me to be valued as an individual. I have embraced new opportunities at full throttle where I continue to use my talents for the greater good and people appreciate what I do.
Jake, 28, Cambridge It has emphasised the importance of family. I want a more balanced life, where family and career can go hand in hand. Previously I had thought that there always needed to be a compromise, however I now realise that with the advent of virtual learning and virtual working, it is more possible than ever before. Physical health has become more of a priority. Having more opportunities to work from home has been a great change of pace and I have seen it manifest in my physical health too (less hair loss, weight management etc). Ronald, 83, Western Australia I loved travel … I had plans to visit Morocco, Turkey, Spain and other parts of Africa and Europe. But I now accept the reality. So, getting to see more of Australia is now more important than seeing other countries. And I really want to spend more time in the bush. I have become more healthy and fit during the pandemic. I have increased my time at the gym … I go for longer jog/walks several times a week. I go to a sauna and spa a few times a week. And I use the treadmill a few times a week … I just want to enjoy things. Mentally, the pandemic has increased my reading, music listening, watching old movies and new TV series.
Juliet, 53, Wollongong Simplifying my life and prioritising what is important to me has been good for my mental health. Less wine is good for my health. Saying no to socialising when I don’t want to is good for my mental health. Reading has been a great pleasure. Now I will spend an entire weekend indoors reading, not feeling the need to go anywhere. Intellectual stimulation feeds my soul and I am getting this from books. I have realised that other forms of indoor entertainment such as podcasts and good TV can be far more stimulating than going out. I would love to quit my job. I realised that I spent a lot of money on things that I did not miss at all, such as eating out … I really don’t need new clothes, or as many trips away. I really embraced being a homebody … I have really embraced my introversion. I now only want to spend money on outings that I am passionate about. Lockdown really made me appreciate where I live, near the beach. Considering that one of the allowed activities was exercising, I realised that a walk in nature is something not to be taken for granted. I have realised that the simple things in life are the best. The pandemic was not a negative experience for me. It’s made me prioritise what is important in my life.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/guardian-australia-readers-respond-how-has-the-pandemic-made-you-rethink-life
6064;6064;Lighten up the satire? That’s a tall order when life is out-crazying the most vivid fiction | Catherine Bennett;2022-01-01T19:00:02Z;['Catherine Bennett'];"[""Don't Look Up"", 'Film', 'Culture', 'Jonathan Swift', 'Books', 'George Orwell', 'Liz Truss']";"In 1944, George Orwell got a letter from TS Eliot, a director at Faber, rejecting his political satire, Animal Farm. There were several reasons. First, it was not the right time. Also, said the creator of The Waste Land, “the effect is simply one of negation”. The poet took issue, too, with the wholesale disrespecting of pigs, since they were logically the “best qualified to run the farm”, being the cleverest. “What was needed (someone might argue) was not more communism but more public spirited pigs.” So, if some leading film critics watching Adam McKay’s Don’t Look Up (currently most-watched on Netflix) have hankered for a less satirical kind of satire, they are in distinguished company. TS Eliot might well have agreed with these reviewers that McKay’s savaging of a society too corrupt and deluded to save itself from an urgent threat to life on Earth, in the film’s case, a comet, could have been more cheerfully done. For instance, echoing Eliot on pigs, some of the more cartoonish leads could have been made more relatable. How about humanising lead villain Peter Isherwell (Mark Rylance being mesmerising), a creepy tech billionaire who, absurdly, intends to live forever? Meanwhile, McKay’s US president, the preposterous Janie Orlean (Meryl Streep) has appointed her dreadful son chief of staff. Why can’t these grievous weirdos with their silly dialogue be more like, say, Donald Trump, Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk? Even the obscure scientists (Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence) attempting to convince an irresponsible leader and a clicks-obsessed media that the Earth truly is in danger, should, it’s been suggested, have been awarded intriguing personal journeys that would offset the more apocalyptic content. Implicit in the professional objections to this film – it is “angry”, “smug”, “sad”, “shrill”, “condescending”, “scattergun”, “disastrous”, “insensitive”, “unfunny”, “depressing”, “heavy handed” but also “toothless” – is the proposal that, if McKay wanted to jolt disengaged people into noticing, even talking about, collective complacency on global warming, some sort of gentler, more immersive approach could have been more effective. How would that work? Maybe imagine Swift’s A Modest Proposal if he’d cut all the heavy-handed sarcasm, stopped droning on about mirrors and considered how baby-eating made vegans feel. Or something akin to political cartoons minus any dung, pigs or insensitive face/body caricature. That the film has, however, an approval rating of 77% against the critics’ 55% (on Rotten Tomatoes) could indicate that the public has a relatively higher tolerance for angry, broad, insulting etc material, at least when this feels like a justifiable response to current politics. Though it helps if it’s funny, biting, gleefully performed by an incredible cast and finally pulls off a massive tonal shift, from propulsive near-farce to stillness and regret. “We really did have everything, didn’t we?” says DiCaprio’s scientist. “I mean, if you think about it.” In fact, Don’t Look Up ends, for all its irksome negativity, by telling us something unusually positive about satire. Maybe, for all the repeated announcements of its death or terminal feebleness, this genre can still be revived, as now, into vigorous, exhilarating life?
After the disparaging reviews, scientists in particular responded that the film’s depiction of their discipline being ignored and trivialised rings utterly true. Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist, called it “the most accurate film about society’s terrifying non-response to climate breakdown I’ve seen”. “Keep it light, fun,” the fictional scientists are exhorted, before discussing imminent extinction on a Fox-like chatshow. And “couldn’t it have been more light, fun?” is a fair summary, by coincidence, of the advice for McKay from detractors. Events dictated that his film offers an additional, aka “scattergun”, commentary on leaders who in the pandemic favoured President Orlean’s approach to an incoming health catastrophe: “sit tight and assess”. No satirist could have anticipated Trump’s bleach advocacy or his fellow fantasist Boris Johnson’s view of the virus as an adversary to be, when he chose to acknowledge its existence, “wrestled to the floor”. McKay’s film doesn’t feature a hilariously vain government figure shagging in the face of extinction: sensitive audiences would probably have thought a Hancockian character either in poor taste, heavy handed or simply unbelievable. “It was already a crazy script but I would say reality out-crazied us by like 10 to 15%,” McKay said. “Well done, reality.” It’s largely because of this routine out-crazying by the usual suspects that satire became the subject of repeated obituaries. But given the professional bollocking administered to McKay’s death-defying production it could also be that old-school, Swiftian satire – that is, not nice and not nuanced – has itself dwindled in appeal. Supposing, as Professor Robert Phiddian has argued, contemporary academics find the conventions of satire frustratingly arbitrary and simplifying, it could be that certain viewers similarly bridle at a film whose authorial intention lies beyond productive dispute. Though shamelessness in public life hasn’t, as it turns out, rendered satire impossible, it hardly invites subtle treatment. How, with the recommended light touch, is a satirist supposed to ridicule a leader who, performing press-ups or other tricks for free editorial, counts his absurdity as a superpower? Nor, given Boris Johnson’s likely successors, is his departure likely to reset satirical standards to those prevailing when Dr Strangelove, with which McKay’s film has been disobligingly compared, was having fun with double entendres. Liz Truss, Johnson’s would-be replacement, was posing in scarlet costumes and an eye-catching new pompadour well before Meryl Streep was accused by critics of overdoing it as the scarlet-suited, over-ringleted President Orlean. Actually, when compared with Truss’s patriotic cheese oration (“That. Is. A. Disgrace”), President Orlean’s rhetoric as she, too, poses as saviour of the free world, is notably sane. Truss won’t be impossible to satirise, but any attempt that isn’t at least unkind, angry, shrill, insensitive, preposterous and depressing is likely to look like PR. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/01/lighten-up-satire-tall-order-life-out-crazying-even-science-fiction
6065;6065;Dan Reeves, who coached four NFL teams to Super Bowl, dies aged 77;2022-01-01T18:41:36Z;['N/A'];['NFL', 'Dallas Cowboys', 'Denver Broncos', 'Atlanta Falcons', 'New York Giants', 'Sport', 'US sports'];"Dan Reeves, who won a Super Bowl as a player with the Dallas Cowboys but was best known for a long coaching career that included four blowout losses in the title game with the Denver Broncos and the Atlanta Falcons, died Saturday. He was 77. A statement released by his family through former Falcons media relations director Aaron Salkin said Reeves died of complications from dementia. The statement said he died “peacefully and surrounded by his loving family at his home in Atlanta”.
“His legacy will continue through his many friends, players and fans as well as the rest of the NFL community,” the family said. Reeves was a versatile player who played a key role in the Cowboys becoming an NFL powerhouse in the 1960s under Tom Landry, but his own coaching career – stretching over three teams and 23 seasons – is where he truly left his mark on the league. Including a stint with the New York Giants, Reeves totaled 190 coaching victories – the ninth-most in NFL history. But he was never able to win the biggest game of all, going 0-4 in the Super Bowl, each of them by double-digit margins. Reeves, Marv Levy and Bud Grant are the only coaches to lose four times in the Super Bowl. “Dan Reeves leaves a lasting legacy in our game as a player and coach,” said Falcons owner Arthur Blank, who fired Reeves from his final job in 2003. “His track record of success in Dallas, Denver, New York and Atlanta over several decades speaks for itself, marking a long and successful life and career in football.” Just 37 when he took over as coach of the Broncos in 1981, Reeves acquired quarterback John Elway in a trade and built a team that made three Super Bowl appearances, earned six trips to the playoffs and won five AFC West titles over his 12-year tenure. But Denver never won an NFL title under Reeves, losing 39-20 to the Giants in the 1987 Super Bowl, 42-10 to Washington in 1988 and 55-10 to the San Francisco 49ers in 1990 – still the most lopsided loss in the game’s history. Despite those defeats and a bitter parting after the 1992 season, Reeves is remembered fondly in Denver, where the Broncos inducted him into their Ring of Honor in 2014.
“Coach Reeves set the foundation for the Broncos’ decade of dominance in the 1980s and championship tradition for years to come,” the team said in a statement. “Reeves coached the Broncos with integrity, character and toughness along with sincere appreciation for his players and coaches.” After a falling out with Elway and allegations that the star quarterback had colluded with then-offensive coordinator (and eventual head coach) Mike Shanahan to force a change, Reeves was fired by the Broncos. He took over the Giants in 1993 and led the team to the playoffs in his first season, but that would be his only postseason appearance in New York. He was fired after four seasons but quickly caught on in 1997 with the Falcons, a homecoming of sorts for the Georgia native. In just his second season with a franchise that had experienced little success, Reeves guided a team known as the ‘Dirty Birds’ to a 14-2 record in the regular season and their first trip to the Super Bowl. After Reeves underwent emergency heart surgery, the Falcons beat the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings in an overtime thriller at the Metrodome to claim the NFC championship, prompting the coach to attempt the arm-flapping dance that star running back Jamal Anderson and other players had made the team’s trademark. “My guy!” Anderson wrote on Twitter. “I am going to miss DR, a first class human, and a most excellent coach. My thoughts and prayers are with (his wife) Pam, his family. A family man first. Respect & love, RIP Coach Reeves!” Reeves again came up short of a championship, losing to Shanahan, Elway and the Broncos 34-19. Reeves engineered a trade that brought Michael Vick to the Falcons and made his final playoff appearance in 2002, when Atlanta became the first road team to win a playoff game in Green Bay. But Vick was injured during the 2003 preseason, and Reeves was fired after the team won just three of its first 13 games. He ended his coaching career – and 39 uninterrupted years in the NFL – with a record of 190-165-2.
Reeves remained in Atlanta after his retirement, most notably serving as an adviser to Georgia State when it launched a football program that now plays in the Sun Belt Conference. Daniel Edward Reeves was born in Rome, Georgia, but grew up in the Americus, in the southwestern part of the state, where he played football, basketball and baseball in high school.
Reeves attended college at South Carolina, where he was a three-year starter at quarterback from 1962-64 and also played baseball for the Gamecocks. Better known as a runner than a passer, Reeves was not drafted after college. He signed a free-agent deal with the Cowboys, who initially wanted him to play safety but wound up moving him to running back. Reeves emerged as one of the team’s key players just as the Cowboys were establishing themselves as the successful franchise that would become known as ‘America’s Team’. He started all 14 games at halfback in 1966, leading the Cowboys in rushing with 757 yards and eight touchdowns. Dallas made its first playoff appearance but lost to the Green Bay Packers in a 34-27 shootout for the NFL championship, missing a chance to play in the first Super Bowl. The following season, Reeves rushed for 603 yards and five TDs, again starting every game, as the Cowboys made another run to the playoffs. Again, they were thwarted by Green Bay one win shy of the Super Bowl, losing to the Packers on a touchdown in the closing seconds of the famed ‘Ice Bowl’ game at frigid Lambeau Field. A knee injury in 1968 limited his effectiveness, and Reeves played only a limited role the rest of his career. But Landry recognized his abilities off the field, asking Reeves to serve as a player-coach while runner such as Duane Thomas and Calvin Hill took on more prominent backfield roles. The Cowboys made their first Super Bowl during the 1970 season, losing to the Baltimore Colts on a last-second field goal, but finally won the championship the following year with a 24-3 victory over the Miami Dolphins. Reeves retired as a player after the 1972 season, becoming a full-time assistant on Landry’s staff. As a head coach, Reeves was known for his gruff, no-nonsense approach and an offensive philosophy that favored a physical running game. But he also coached two of the game’s most dynamic offensive players, Vick and Elway, defying those who labeled him as old-fashioned. With his distinctive Southern drawl, Reeves could be honest to a fault, such as when he spoke openly of the rift that led to his departure in Denver – and opened up a lot of old wounds – during the lead-up to the Falcons facing the Broncos in the 1999 Super Bowl. “There’s still a lot of hurt that won’t ever go away,” Reeves said. “You never will forget those things.” But Reeves rarely held grudges, even with members of the media that he had clashed with. In his later years, he would gladly take phone calls to discuss the issues of the day, once joking when a reporter identified himself, “OK, what did I do wrong now?” Reeves is survived by wife Pam, his high school sweetheart; children Dana, Lee and Laura; as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Funeral arrangements have yet to be announced.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/01/dan-reeves-death-nfl-coach-falcons-broncos
6066;6066;Police name teenager stabbed in Croydon as Zaian Aimable-Lina;2022-01-01T18:39:55Z;['Jane Clinton'];['London', 'UK news'];A 15-year-old boy stabbed to death in Croydon, south London, on Thursday has been identified as Zaian Aimable-Lina, the Metropolitan police said. Police have said Zaian was from the local area. A 15-year-old boy who was arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail to a date in late January. Zaian’s death marked the 29th teenage homicide in London in 2021, surpassing the 27 seen in 2017, which had been the highest in recent years. The previous peak was 29 teenage homicides in the capital in 2008. However, within minutes of Zaian’s death a 16-year-old boy died after being stabbed to death at Philpots Farm Open Space in Yiewsley, Hillingdon, west London, making him the 30th teenage homicide in the capital in 2021. Met Police Commander Alex Murray said: “I am deeply saddened by every single homicide this year, and greatly concerned by those that have been teenage killings. Each one is a tragedy leaving behind heartbroken families and distressed communities. “My thoughts are with the victims and all those impacted. They are not statistics, not just numbers, they all have families, and they all should have had their lives ahead of them. “They and their families have been robbed of something precious and we should all be doing everything we can to stop this,” he said. He added that the police were devoting “huge resources” to preventing homicides and said the Met was not “complacent” about knife crime. Chief Inspector Richard Leonard said: “My thoughts continue to be with Zaian’s family and friends as they cope with this tragic loss. My team are continuing to work around the clock so that we can give Zaian’s family the answers they deserve. “Zaian’s death has sent shockwaves through the local community and London as a whole. He was just 15 years old and had his whole life ahead of him, and we need the community to work with us to bring those responsible to justice.” In a Twitter thread, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he was “devastated” by the deaths of the two boys and he was in close contact with the Met “who are doing everything possible to bring those responsible to justice”. He said the safety of Londoners “will always be my number one priority” and he was “investing record amounts in policing to put more officers on the streets and creating positive opportunities for almost 100,000 young Londoners, helping to divert them away from violence”. He added: “I refuse to accept that the loss of young lives is inevitable, and will continue to be relentless in taking the bold action needed to put an end to violence in our city.”;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/01/police-name-teenager-stabbed-in-croydon-as-zaian-aimable-lina
6067;6067;Covid cases in England hit new record high of 162,572;2022-01-01T18:14:32Z;['Jane Clinton'];['Coronavirus', 'UK news'];England reported a record high daily total of 162,572 new cases on Saturday, up from 160,276 the previous day, official data showed. The government said a further 154 people had died in England within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 174,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The data normally also includes Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but did not on Saturday because of differences in reporting schedules over the new year weekend. The figures come as the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said further restrictions in England must be a “last resort” and that the UK must prepare to “live alongside” coronavirus in 2022. But he said the record-breaking wave of the Omicron Covid variant would “test the limits of finite NHS capacity even more than a typical winter”. It came as an NHS leader warned the next few days would be crucial in the fight to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, said staff were working “flat out” and that the NHS was under “arguably more pressure” than this time last year. In a thread on Twitter, he wrote: “NHS preparing for worst & hoping for best. Staff flat out, esp. given level of staff absences. We will need to ask them to perform flexible heroics again if hospital Covid numbers continue to rise. “We can’t keep doing this. Long-term NHS capacity issues must be addressed.” He said the booster vaccination campaign was “significantly more resource-intensive”, and staff absences meant the NHS was “beyond full stretch”.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/covid-cases-in-england-hit-new-record-high-of-162572
6068;6068;‘I don’t want to be in that dark place again’: Elise Christie on depression, skating and her new life;2022-01-01T18:00:03Z;['Donald McRae'];['Speed skating', 'Sport', 'Winter Olympics'];"“This doesn’t feel different to a death,” Elise Christie says as she tries to build a new world without speed skating, the sport that has consumed half her life. Christie, a three-time world champion who also won 10 European titles, announced her retirement last month after a year which nearly took her life. Christie had been hoping to compete in her fourth Winter Olympics next month but, feeling let down by the sport and struggling with injury and her mental health, she says: “It’s like you’ve lost the most important thing in your life and the thing that you gave everything up for.” Christie sits on a sofa at home in Nottingham and rubs her face gently. Earlier this evening she had broken the news to me, in a revelation she has not discussed publicly before, that loss and trauma drove her into a depression where she attempted to take her own life last April. We have also discussed how she is now trying to summon the resilience that usually defines her. “I spent 16 years hammering away, trying to win constantly and it’s taken its toll,” the 31-year-old Scot says softly. Over the past year, because none of her world or European titles made any money, Christie had been working at Pizza Hut while chasing her Olympic dream. But last week, adjusting to her skating retirement, Christie started a different job. She now works part-time behind the till at a Shell garage as she considers two offers to transition to a different Winter Olympic sport. It means that, while still hurting after everything she has been through, she is defiant and hopeful. “I don’t want to die. I don’t want to leave everyone behind and create pain for them. I want to carry on. Sport has improved vastly with mental health the last four years, and so has the world, but it wasn’t enough for what I had to deal with [last] year. I don’t blame anyone. I’m not angry at anyone. I was at one point, like anyone would be, but I’m not now.” A few months ago Christie released her autobiography, the powerful and aptly named Resilience, in which she described 2018 as the hardest year of her life. She entered the Winter Olympics that year as a multiple world champion, but Christie had been persuaded to skate when she was injured in an effort to win more places for her team. Catastrophe struck at the Games in South Korea when she was disqualified controversially, twice, and taken out on the ice and penalised in her final attempt at winning a medal. Christie’s tears went viral but, months later, the devastation ran far deeper. Her long-standing coach, Nick Gooch, was made redundant, her Olympic gold medal-winning boyfriend, the Hungarian skater Shaolin Sandor Liu, left her by text and Christie’s self-harming escalated. A few days after Christmas in 2018 she was so distressed that, in the midst of self-harming, she injured herself so seriously that she feared her life was in danger. In shock, Christie suddenly did not want to die. A friend rushed her to hospital where she was told how lucky she had been.
Three years have passed since then. Before Christie discusses the future she revisits the fresh turbulence of 2021 in a typically raw and open way. She remembers that last April, after terrible pain in her personal life, “I spiralled quite badly and I had an attempt [to take her life]. It was very difficult … I would never class myself as suicidal because I don’t think I’ve ever felt I want to die. But I was in too much pain. A friend sent me a message that night. He said: ‘Are you OK?’ I was like: ‘Not really.’ I don’t know how he knew, because I didn’t say [she had just attempted to take her life], but he had a feeling. He patched me up and helped me.” What would have happened if he hadn’t rescued her that night? Christie shakes her head. Was it worse than her hospitalisation in 2018? “A lot worse. But I thought it wouldn’t be good for all the people who follow me for mental health if I just gave up like that.” Christie looks up. “Since then, I’ve not self-harmed. It’s been steady progress but I wasn’t supported very well through it in terms of skating. I was lucky to have my family around me. They live in Scotland but they came to see me. I had my job at Pizza Hut and they were really good with me, giving me time off, and being understanding. So it was a very difficult period and there were points where I didn’t know if I’d be able to function again. But I was like: ‘Nah, we need to change this.’ That’s why spreading awareness about mental health has become such a purpose for me. What happened with skating this year is crap but I’ve still got something else I’m focused on. I’m working towards helping lots of people.” Now, after almost an hour of talking about 2021, which also included a car accident and the recent death of her grandfather, Christie smiles grimly when I say it sounds like an even harder year than 2018. “It’s hands down topped it,” she says wryly. “It’s been a lot worse. But it taught me so much because if I had been unlucky and gone that day [when she tried to take her life eight months ago], I’d have left so many people in pain. I’d have also given up the legacy I believe in, which is to help people with their mental health, and show them you can get through this stuff. “So I’m not sitting here having not qualified [for the Olympics] and losing my career, and going: ‘I’m better off dead.’ I’m trying to show people something different, Yes, I’m struggling. I’m gutted. But I don’t want to be in that dark place again. I’m working on other things now, progressing my life in other ways, focusing on sorting myself out.”
The saga of her non-qualification for the Olympics is complicated but, until she slipped into the depression that nearly ended her life, Christie had been skating effectively. “I’d been keeping up with the boys and racing them really well. But after I had some time off [in April] I’d asked for a clinical psychologist and wasn’t given one. I was then told that until the clinical psychologist was involved, I can’t train. It ended up being four weeks. Eventually I spoke to my sports psychologist who I’ve known for years. He is ace and I said: ‘We need to do something because I’m missing too much.’ So he and the doctor helped get me back on the ice. I still didn’t have a clinical psychologist but I said: ‘I’ll push all this to the side and get stuck into training.’ It was going really well up to August.” Christie then began cramping in her legs and feet and “it was like I was seizing up while skating. The problem was we had three weeks until the qualifiers. So there was no time really to sort anything. Mentally I’ve pushed something to the side. I’ve now got this physical illness pushed to the side and I’ve been made to skate through the qualifiers. The national trials were in September and I got really sick. I should have pulled out of trials but I was told if I did I won’t get selected for the Olympic qualifiers. I had to race very unwell and got my arse kicked at the trials. “Between the trials and [Olympic] qualifiers someone above me decided I had to have a psychological evaluation. I don’t know if it came from a good or a bad place. I just know I’ve asked for a clinical psychologist all year. I’m now being doubted. Is my physical illness actually in my head? I’ve got 10 days to get this done or I don’t go. So I didn’t train during that time because I was so stressed.” Christie passed the evaluation but she was still battling injury. “I didn’t skate the last week [of the qualifiers] as there was no point. I felt gutted, because I was thinking: ‘Why is my own country stopping me going to the Olympics when I’m racing on a badly sprained ankle after being ill all year?’” *** In her book Christie writes of how, before the 2018 Olympics, she was doubted when she complained of an injury. She was finally given a scan and Christie was elated when it was proved she had torn a tendon. “I was injured but I wasn’t insane,” she says. She saw herself as being a “medal machine” that needed to race to secure funding for her sport. “If you look at Arianna Fontana [the Italian speed skater who won eight Olympic medals], she’s had a much longer and much more successful Olympic career than me. But she did not achieve some of the other stuff I’ve done and she was never put under the same level of pressure. She could take time out, reduce her training load and still have income. But every year I had to be the one that kept the programme funded – or that’s how it felt to me. “It was the same at every world championships. I didn’t enjoy my medals. It was like: ‘I’ve got to medal to keep my funding.’ When I got that injury in 2018 the best thing would have been not to send me to the next two qualifiers, because I was already qualified. But instead it was another five weeks’ training on a leg that had a significant tear. It meant I was in agony at the Olympics.”
Christie has suffered extensively and, having been bullied as a schoolgirl, she was raped at the age of 19. She did not feel strong enough to report the crime, even after the man who assaulted her apologised much later. Christie spoke about the rape for the first time in her book and she says: “I wasn’t speaking about it to get a conviction. I spoke up to create awareness.” The conviction rate of rapists is shockingly low and Christie shakes her head again when asked if she believes this will soon change. “No. Even if I went through it again today I couldn’t honestly say I’d do anything about it – not when people accused me of lying after I spoke about it.” It’s difficult for Christie in the wake of her retirement but, with fresh hope and light in her voice, she says: “I still feel passionate about sports and training. I’ve been offered three options. One of them isn’t an Olympic sport, and two are. I’d still love to have the Olympic medal, though, because that’s my passion. But if I can help one person with mental health issues that would mean more than any medal. So I’d rather take my time now to heal and look after myself and help others with their mental health.” Resilience by Elise Christie is published by Reach Sport In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

6069;6069;Raven Leilani: ‘I was flying by the seat of my pants’;2022-01-01T18:00:03Z;['Hephzibah Anderson'];['Fiction', 'Books', 'Culture'];"Raven Leilani is the author of Luster, a kinetic, award-winning debut novel whose fans include Barack Obama. Now published in paperback, it tells the story of Edie, a young black woman trying to find her way as a painter in New York City. After getting fired from an entry-level publishing job and ground down by the gig economy, Edie moves in with her middle-aged white lover, his white wife, and their (adopted) black daughter in the suburbs. Cue a plethora of razor-sharp, caustically funny insights into the politics of race, gender and desire. Leilani, 31, spoke from her home in Brooklyn. What inspired Luster? I wrote it when I was in NYU’s MFA [creative writing] programme, which I’d come to with an entirely different novel. When my teachers asked me whether I had any real intention behind my project and I couldn’t articulate an answer, I started Luster. I wanted to write something that felt honest and urgent. Because I was trying to scrabble together pages, I wrote in a panic and edited myself emotionally less, so the work came from a more vulnerable place. And some of the most vulnerable subjects for me, I guess, are art and intimacy and failure. How much did you plot in advance? I was flying by the seat of my pants. I knew I was going to write about painting and I absolutely knew that I was going to write about Edie’s experience in the middle of this open relationship, but the book kept changing as I was writing. It still feels crazy to admit this, but Edie was supposed to die.
I’m so glad she didn’t! She is such a unique force. Were there any other literary characters who helped you glimpse who she might be? She came from an intensely personal place, but there existed in the ether these threads that introduce women who were allowed to fail and be fallible, to be sexual and make mistakes and even be complicit in their own subjugation. Toni Morrison’s Sula is a crucial text in rendering the interior lives of complicated, contradictory black women. Brit Bennett’s The Mothers is a more contemporary example of a woman’s ambivalence and fallibility. Candice Carty-Williams’s Queenie made me feel able to write candidly about sex and yearning. There’s a moment when Edie fantasises about being hit and then lets her older white boyfriend do just that. How have readers responded to this? It comes up a lot. It’s one of those things where I think, in 20 years, will I look back and have qualms? But currently I’m happy I was able to represent her pleasure on the page without judgment. It’s a deeply tricky thing to write about a black woman who is inviting this kind of violence. I wanted her to be a character who has the freedom to find pleasure where she finds it, but it is, too, still quite intertwined with the fact that because she is a black woman, she experiences these loud and soft violences in her public life, and choosing it in her private life is a way to exert that control that she doesn’t have elsewhere. Sex scenes can be tough to write. What guided you? I wrote them in a way that was sensitive to the private logistics and the trial and error of longing, and of developing – especially as a young woman – an informed idea of what your pleasure looks like, and how to ask for it. Authentic desire can feel so fraught as a woman, right? Yes, extremely. You have to undo a lifetime’s worth of conditioning. The moment I turned 30, my algorithm began showing me Botox. No shaming – what makes you feel beautiful makes you feel beautiful – but that programming is so deeply insidious that the work of saying simply “this is what feels good” is still extremely radical.
Luster captures so acutely the grind of keeping body and soul together while trying to make it in a city like New York. That was one of a handful of missions I had going into the book – not to represent the starving artist, the exhaustion, as a romance. It was important to me to talk about the roaches and the mice as opposed to the mythic end of the journey where you have the apartment in the sky. You worked for five years in between finishing college and starting your MFA. What kept you going creatively? I was mostly concerned with how to pay my student debt and how to pay my rent. I would come home after work and write. I remember the first time I started submitting poems – I got nothing but rejections. But I love writing so much, I was happy to be living in those worlds that I’d made. Has it always been that way for you? Yes. I was a solitary kid and when I started writing around eight or nine, that was how I’d create my own fun. It still is. Tell me about your own connection to painting. My brother was a painter, and I inherited my love of that medium from him, but I felt I couldn’t be good enough as fast as I wanted, and so for a while I didn’t paint at all. During the pandemic, I started again, and I remembered why it was my first love. Are your paintings abstract or figurative? Always figurative. I am obsessed with the body – with the parts that are pleasure and the parts that are pain and dysfunction. If you can draw a hand, it’s a superpower. Do you have a writing routine? My brain doesn’t turn completely on until the sun goes down, so I write at night, in bed – where I am right now – and to music. What was on your playlist for Luster? A ton of disco. I had my Diana Ross, my Sister Sledge, but I also listened to Metallica. I crave that abrasive wall of sound – it really centres me both in life and on the page. You’ve worked in publishing. Would you say the industry’s finally getting to grips with its representation problem? I’d say that we’re making strides but there’s still a lot of work to be done. I am optimistic, partly because we have so many writers from marginalised groups working who are incredibly brilliant, incredibly fresh and incredibly hungry. If I asked you to name a black female writer who deserves more recognition, who would you choose? Asali Solomon, whose book The Days of Afrekete came out recently. I don’t know that she’s underrated but I feel like she is an absolute genius. I love what she does formally and what she manages to emotionally pack into very few pages.
What books are currently on your bedside table? Sometimes I Trip on How Happy We Could Be by Nichole Perkins, The School for Good Mothers by Jessamine Chan, How Music Works by David Byrne, and Sheila Heti’s new novel, Pure Colour. If ever I’m stuck, I’ll pick up a book that will give me fuel. Heti’s How Should a Person Be? is a text I refer to a lot. What did you read as a child? The kind of books that you read when your parents just see you reading and they don’t realise what you’re reading. So Anne Rice, Laurell K Hamilton, the really sexy gothic vampire fiction – I loved those. What writers working today do you most admire? I would say both Zadie Smith and Katie Kitamura. I’ve been lucky that they are heroes and I’ve also got to learn from them as teachers. Luster is published in paperback on 6 January by Pan Macmillan (£9.99).

6070;6070;Jos Buttler insists he has no plans to retire from Test cricket after Ashes;2022-01-01T18:00:02Z;['Ali Martin'];['Jos Buttler', 'England cricket team', 'Ashes 2021-22', 'The Ashes', 'Australia sport', 'Cricket', 'Sport'];"Jos Buttler says a chastening Ashes campaign – for himself and England – has not diminished his desire to remain a three-format player in international cricket. The 31-year-old wicketkeeper-batter has long since established himself as one of the leading limited-overs players in the world but so far his tour of Australia has continued a 56-cap Test career that, while not without highlights, is yet to live up to the same billing. Though a determined 207-ball rearguard on the final day of the second Test in Adelaide was commendable after coming in on a pair, dropped catches in that match and a rash dismissal during England’s first-innings collapse at the MCG have contributed to the 3-0 scoreline that leaves the tourists playing for pride in Sydney and Hobart. Asked if he still wanted to pursue Test cricket given his young family, his obvious market value in the less labour-intensive shorter formats and the recent decision by South Africa’s Quinton de Kock to become a white-ball specialist, Buttler said: “It’s certainly my ambition. I don’t think I’d have put as much into it as I have done if it wasn’t. “I have fantastic family support – they’re very supportive of me and my career, and make a lot of sacrifices for that. It’s certainly maintained my drive and ambition to try and play [Test cricket].”
On De Kock, Buttler said: “That’s Quinton’s own personal situation. As a huge fan of his, I’m disappointed that he’s at that stage. I love watching him bat, keep wicket and play Test cricket. I commend him for making a decision that’s right for him. But I feel I’ve got that support and in a place where I want to try to make it work.” As such, the next two Tests represent an important time for Buttler and a number of teammates who want to secure places on the tour of the Caribbean in March. Who will select that squad is not a given, with the position of the head coach, Chris Silverwood, under review while he isolates in Melbourne due to a Covid case in his family. Adam Hollioake will not be able to join the setup because of a close contact testing positive but England are yet to report any cases within the camp beyond the three coaches and four family members who tested positive this week – Australia similarly cleared their latest tests after Travis Head’s diagnosis – and Buttler believes there is a determination among his teammates to put on a performance for those left behind. He said: “One thing is we’re massively in it all together. We live it all together and we want to play well for each other. It’s frustrating for Chris he’s not here with us – another complication of the tour – but we’re certainly very united. “There is an overriding sense of disappointment and frustration with the situation we’ve found ourselves in. We certainly don’t want to be a team to lose 5-0.” On the off-field distraction of Covid cases, he said: “A year ago, when something like this happened, it was a much bigger shock and more of a worry. At the moment it’s still a worry and waiting for a Covid test is a bit like playing rouletteat the minute.[But] we need to be in a place where Covid doesn’t stop everything. There will be positive cases throughout the tour. We hoped that wouldn’t be the case, but we’re trying to manage it as best as possible.”";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/01/england-jos-buttler-insists-he-has-no-plans-to-retire-from-test-cricket-after-ashes
6071;6071;England’s failure to use Mark Wood’s pace is missed Ashes opportunity | Ali Martin;2022-01-01T18:00:02Z;['Ali Martin'];['England cricket team', 'Ashes 2021-22', 'The Ashes', 'Australia sport', 'Cricket', 'Sport', 'Australia cricket team'];"Good news has been in short supply for England’s cricketers during this Ashes series but some arrived for Mark Wood in the shape of the new year honours list: his father was awarded an OBE for services to pensioners for his work at the Department for Work and Pensions in the north-east. Derek Wood was also among the first to sample his son’s speeds in the back garden at home in Ashington. “We had to stop when I was about 13,” the younger Wood told me six years ago, shortly after winning his first Test call-up. “We had a long thin garden and I’d charge in from the conifers at the back. I kept hitting him on the head.” Fast forward to the present day, with England 3-0 down and only a whitewash to dodge, and it is hard not to sigh when pondering Wood and a missed opportunity. Jofra Archer has been a loss, no question, but for the first time in a long time – perhaps going back to Frank Tyson in 1954-55 – England still pitched up in Australia with the fastest bowler on either side; certainly the fastest in a generation of Englishmen and, in terms of sustained pace in Test cricket, the fastest in the world. The latter may surprise a few people but the analysts CricViz only have it one way: since the start of 2020 no Test quick can top Wood’s average speed of 88.2mph (142kph), while his pace on this tour, averaging 90mph (144.91kph), is the highest by a visiting bowler to Australia since Hawk-Eye data began in 2006. Four years on from a 4-0 Ashes defeat that highlighted England’s need for speed, here it is.
But for how long? Wood’s physical hardiness has been questionable in the past but since lengthening his run-up and smoothing things out at the end of 2018 he is now consistently producing eye-popping numbers on the speed gun. Yet with him about to turn 32, his best work coming overseas and with white-ball specialism clearly an option in his final years, the sight of Wood in the whites of England haring in should be savoured. Pace isn’t everything. A skiddy trajectory from 5ft 11in makes the ideal length a tricky balancing act on these surfaces and five wickets at 32 does not jump off the page (even if he beat the bat with such regularity in Brisbane as to wonder whether he had walked under ladder). Nevertheless, seeing David Warner’s back leg twitch at the point of release, Steve Smith nick off for 12 at the Gabba to a smart plan executed at 91.6mph or Marnus Labuschagne similarly edging behind for one at the MCG, there have been flashes of what might have been for England had the batters not wilted.
“We know we haven’t scored the runs to help the bowling attack,” said Jos Buttler. “Woody has bowled fantastically well and any time he has the ball in hand it’s exciting. When someone can bowl at that pace – and from ball one he’s up at that mark – it’s an incredibly exciting asset to have in your team. “At times he’s bowled without much luck as well. At Melbourne he could certainly have picked up more wickets for how well he bowled. “But yeah, we know that we haven’t scored the runs to give the bowling attack that sort of base that we’ve needed. Having kept to him, he is bowling as quick as ever and he looks fantastic.” Chris Silverwood is a good man and the head coach deserves sympathy as he sits in isolation in Melbourne. Cricket-wise there have been too many errors on this tour, however, and the decision to rest Wood in Adelaide after bowling 25.1 overs in the first Test must sit among them. Silverwood and Joe Root spoke of a need for Wood to play a fuller role later in the series, but this was just one example of their failure to grasp that defeat in the second Test meant there would be no “later in the series”. The phrase “it’s a marathon, not a sprint” kept coming out, when England simply had to burst out of the blocks. Having bowled in only two innings through the inadequacies of others, and with six days of rest between matches boosted to eight thanks to the battergeddon in Melbourne, there seems little reason why Wood will not play in the fourth Test at Sydney, starting on Wednesday. The SCG has replaced the MCG as the pitch that causes the most angst locally these days and, if as flat as expected, his clear point of difference may well be required to transcend conditions. Elsewhere, however, England have slightly painted themselves into a corner, dropping Rory Burns and Ollie Pope in Melbourne and seeing little difference in the result. The former has been working with Graham Thorpe in the nets to calm down his idiosyncratic movements but may not get an instant return unless concerns over Haseeb Hameed’s retreat prove too great.
Should England decide they want to look to the future, it may also be that Jonny Bairstow at No 6 drops out after just one Test. If so, Dan Lawrence could find himself the latest reserve asked to play without meaningful preparation. Australia will be forced into at least one change with Travis Head, their leading run scorer of these Ashes, having tested positive for Covid-19. All other results came back negative and logically Usman Khawaja should feature at the ground where his 171 four years ago ground England into the dust. There are further decisions to be made, with Scott Boland perhaps dropping down now Jhye Richardson is fit again, despite the 32-year-old’s remarkable figures of six for seven at the MCG. Ultimately, Pat Cummins and his head coach, Justin Langer, do not have to stress too much, even if their batters will still need to be on high alert when Wood starts charging in from the conifers once more.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/01/englands-missed-opportunities-leave-mark-wood-hoping-to-stop-whitewash
6072;6072;Arsenal floored but Saka and co left wearing a little halo of hope | Jonathan Liew;2022-01-01T18:00:02Z;['Jonathan Liew'];['Arsenal', 'Manchester City', 'Football', 'Sport'];"A strange and unfamiliar noise swirled around the Emirates Stadium at full-time. Strewn across the turf in red and white was the human rubble of a crushing injury-time defeat. Takehiro Tomiyasu and Ben White were out cold. Thomas Partey, hand outstretched, helped them up. And as Arsenal’s exhausted players slowly winched themselves to their feet, the four sides of the ground rose to applaud them: a gesture of approval, pride, perhaps even defiance. Yes, Arsenal had lost to Manchester City again. Yes, it had been largely self-inflicted again. But somehow this did not feel like the other times.
To anyone who lived through the really bad years, who has seen this stadium at its most toxic and disenchanted, who has seen successive generations blanched and brutalised, this in itself was bracingly new. We can argue about how good this Arsenal side actually are, about whether their recent boost in form is any more sustainable than the ones that preceded it. But right now there is a little halo of hope around this club, and it feels like the most fragile and the most important thing at once. Let’s deal with the game first: Arsenal were brilliant for 45 minutes at the start and resolute for 30 minutes at the end with 10 men. Even so, we cannot ignore the fact that, at the pivotal points of the game, City held their nerve and Arsenal lost theirs. This, as much as anything they do tactically or technically, is the true mark of City’s current dominance over English football: no team since Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United has been as adept at leveraging their aura and reputation. Referees get flustered. Opponents do stupid things. The margins for error are so fine that every moment becomes a pressure-point, a high-stress situation, a potential disaster in the making. Does Gabriel clean out Gabriel Jesus and earn a second yellow if he isn’t painfully aware of City’s speed on the counter? Does Granit Xhaka tug desperately at Bernardo Silva’s shirt if he isn’t wary of Silva’s ability to squirm through the tiniest gap at light speed? This is the privilege of champions: even when you’re not at your best, oppositions still have to pretend you are. And yet, for a decent chunk of the game, Arsenal offered the rest of the league a blueprint. They put on a show. The full-backs camped out in the City half. Partey and Martin Ødegaard had the keys to the midfield. Most importantly they had a goal to show for their efforts and it came from the player who more than anyone seems to embody the spirit and basic tactile pleasure of this Arsenal side. There is perhaps no better noise in English football right now than the sound a crowd makes when Bukayo Saka gets the ball in space. Something strange is happening with Saka at the moment. It’s not simply that he’s a brilliant player in a rich vein of form, although he is and he is. It’s more the way people respond to him: Arsenal fans, England fans, rival fans, children, grandparents. People love this guy.
People who don’t even like football like Saka. Hard-bitten fans in the Clock End who have spent decades screaming abuse at anyone bold enough to step within earshot melt like marshmallows in his presence. Consider: this is a guy who misses the crucial penalty in a European Championship final, England’s first major men’s final for 55 years, and somehow he doesn’t get turned into a pizza advert or a punchline or a meme. Instead, people love him more. People clutch him to their hearts a little tighter. People feel for him. One could see it in the way he disappeared into the crowd after scoring his goal: a sea of bobbing heads and screaming faces and phone screens. Grown men and women ruffled his hair and shouted things into his ear and threw their arms towards him, hoping to touch the hem of his garment.
On one level, it was merely the futile first goal in a 2-1 defeat. But as a moment of pure human connection it was the most powerful moment of the day, and by extension the year. Saka has already survived. He knows what tough times feel like. Last year he was Arsenal’s player of the season in a thoroughly joyless, depressing campaign. Doubtless there will be tougher times to come too, particularly in this flawed and improving young team still trying to find its place in the world. But somehow in the bear pit of modern football, a place that feels angrier and more balkanised with every passing week, this 20-year-old man still manages to turn out every week and show us a little joy. And that, at least, is something worth holding on to.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/01/arsenal-floored-but-bukayo-saka-and-co-left-wearing-a-little-halo-of-hope
6073;6073;From the women’s Euros to Qatar World Cup, 2022’s football highlights;2022-01-01T18:00:01Z;['Nick Ames'];['Football', 'Sport', 'Africa Cup of Nations', 'Africa Cup of Nations 2022', 'World Cup 2022 qualifiers', 'World Cup 2022', 'World Cup'];"January – Africa Cup of Nations Prevailing attitudes towards Afcon among Premier League clubs are often unhealthy but, for those with a genuine love for the sport itself, it is one of the most captivating spectacles around. This year’s edition, postponed from 2021, will be played in Cameroon; the competition has become used to late scares over its hosting and has had to overcome concerns over Omicron and the reluctance of European sides to release their players. But once the Indomitable Lions kick off against Burkina Faso on 9 January attention will rest on the pitch. It should be an open tournament, contested by some of the world’s best players, with the 2019 finalists, Algeria and Senegal, the teams to beat. About 40 of the players taking part are England-based, while the commitment shown by Sky and the BBC in screening every game is testament to the tournament’s invigorated global profile. March – World Cup play-offs The World Cup play-offs reliably offer some of the most exhilarating, nail-biting tension around and this year is unlikely to be different. In Europe a new format sees three mini-tournaments start at the semi-final stage on 24 March and conclude, five days later, with a set of knife-edge shootouts for a place at Qatar 2022. Should things go as expected, Portugal will face Italy in one of them; Wales could play Scotland in another and it would be heartening to see home nations’ interest next winter extend beyond England. Elsewhere, five African teams will emerge from a set of intense two-legged ties with a World Cup berth: the draw will be made this month and Mali, in particular, may fancy a first qualification. Further play-offs pitting an Asian side against a South American team, and Concacaf representatives against one from Oceania, will take place in Qatar during the summer.
May – Championship shakedown Fulham and Bournemouth have threatened to run away with the Championship at times and, as a later point will cover, that is no good thing. But they have serious competition from Blackburn, outsiders at the start of the season but third by a whisker after taking 22 points from the last available 24. The picture below that is reliably chaotic, with teams as far down as 12th-placed Sheffield United harbouring realistic ambition of a play-off push. All of life can still be found in England’s second tier for now, even if it appears at perpetual risk of becoming more stratified than ever. If the tension does dry up at the top then not to worry: in the nether regions Wayne Rooney’s Derby, deducted 21 points and operating with a patchwork squad, have embarked on a run that puts them in with a shout of what would surely be the most unlikely survival of all time.
May – Can Arsenal Women turn back the clock? Time was when Arsenal Women had a stranglehold on the domestic game. They had won seven straight titles when the Women’s Super League was inaugurated in 2011 and immediately added two more. But they have won only one of the subsequent eight and were not expected to topple the lavishly resourced Chelsea or Manchester City this time around. With the halfway stage looming, though, they lead Emma Hayes’ side by four points while City are nowhere. Under Jonas Eidevall, a young Swede who increasingly looks to have been an inspired replacement for Joe Montemurro last summer, Arsenal have improved significantly and played some delightful attacking football. It goes without saying that Vivianne Miedema, second in the division’s scoring charts, has been fundamental to their title charge; she is out of contract in the summer but, should Arsenal be able to roll back the years to reign supreme once more, it might become easier to make her stay.
July – England hosts Euro 2022 Only three Uefa Women’s Championships have been staged since England last hosted the tournament but Euro 2005 feels a lifetime away. Back then the hosts finished bottom of Group A and the final between Norway and the eventual champions, Germany, drew just over 21,000 fans to Ewood Park. Nowadays England, semi-finalists in 2017, can be considered among the favourites and should be spurred on by a tide of euphoria. The stock of the women’s game has never been higher and should only grow this summer, with no serious competition in the footballing calendar. Euro 2022 was originally Euro 2021 but found itself moved back in the calendar after Covid-19 meant the men’s Euro 2020 was postponed; it will be worth the wait, with 10 venues around the country giving access to a wide distribution of fans, and if Sarina Wiegman’s team go all the way, the Wembley final will be the summer’s hottest ticket.
July – Who will sign Vlahovic and Haaland? The two brightest young strikers in Europe will probably lead the summer’s transfer chatter. In an ideal world Dusan Vlahovic would stay at Fiorentina, watch a successful team be built around him and cement a legacy akin to that of Gabriel Batistuta. But nobody with the 21-year-old striker’s potential is allowed to stick around outside the biggest clubs for long nowadays and, given he has rejected a new contract, he will almost certainly be with a Champions League big hitter next season. Vlahovic, who has scored 16 in 19 for a mid-table side this season, could plausibly fill a centre-forward vacancy – if there really is one – at Manchester City. Similar questions will be asked about Erling Braut Haaland, whose early-career feats have been even more remarkable. If Vlahovic’s inevitable departure speaks wearily of football’s modern-day market forces then the idea Haaland must leave Borussia Dortmund to better himself is even more grim and it seems likely he will take his phenomenal goalscoring capacities to England or Spain for 2022-23.
August – 30 years of the Premier League The second weekend of the 2022-23 season will mark three decades since a Premier League ball was first kicked in earnest. It has become a runaway train, cannibalising the vast majority of its competition, and the brutal truth is that even its lower-ranked sides can outspend all bar a tiny handful of their contemporaries elsewhere in Europe. The current campaign features 12 of those who were pioneers in 1992 and that does suggest a reasonable degree of mobility across the divisions has been sustained. But the more recent proliferation of yo-yo sides such as Norwich, Fulham and West Brom serves as a warning that diversity is becoming limited, as does the remorseless accrual of points at the top by Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool. The quality might be high but, after a year when its leading lights disgraced themselves by attempting to found the European Super League, there is little sign that the top flight has serious interest in helping the rest keep up. A welcome 30th birthday present might be a little humility and a dose of awareness that a healthy bigger picture would make the “product” even more attractive and less predictable.
November – World Cup in Qatar A dozen years after winning the rights, Qatar opens its doors to the world amid the most jumbled-up feelings. Everyone loves World Cups: they are precious and all the more so for taking place every four years, which is one of the reasons Fifa’s attempt to rush in a biennial format must be stopped. But this one takes place under an inescapable cloud and the best thing football can do is try to strike a balance. If this tournament has anything like the on-pitch drama of Russia 2018 and Euro 2020, it will be the most entrancing of diversions as the nights get colder and shorter; the profile that brings must count for something, though, given the long list of human rights concerns that have dogged the hosts. National teams can take a stand, as Denmark have in pledging to step up their public criticism of Qatar over the coming months. The real test for this World Cup, far beyond its entertainment value, will be whether it has lived up to its own billing as a force for lasting good.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/from-promotion-races-to-superstar-signings-2022s-football-highlights
6074;6074;Virgil van Dijk toils a little now but Liverpool really found a magic bullet | Barney Ronay;2022-01-01T18:00:01Z;['Barney Ronay'];['Liverpool', 'Chelsea', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Romelu Lukaku'];"“How have we managed to sign this guy?” There is something a little vague and apocryphal about the oft-quoted reaction of one unnamed Celtic player to seeing Virgil van Dijk in training on his first day at the club. Van Dijk was 22 at the time and a late bloomer, rejected as a teenager by Willem II (“too many limitations”), and more recently by Ajax, PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord, with two decent seasons at Groningen to recommend him.
Celtic paid £1.74m up front for Van Dijk. And exactly how this came to pass remains an excellent question, one that speaks to Van Dijk’s own slow-burn rise from the fringes of Dutch football; through the meandering promise of his early years (as the journalist Simon Kuper put it: “a first-rate player with a second-rate career”); to that period in 2018-2020 when he stood apart in his own clear, clean space as the best pure defender in world football. Sunday’s trip to Stamford Bridge is an anniversary game for Liverpool and Van Dijk. It is almost exactly four years since he made his debut against Everton at Anfield, four years since the club paid what was then a world-record transfer fee for a defender. At the time Van Dijk had never played in the Champions League knockout stages and had made only 16 appearances for his country. This was a signing based on that same sense of double-take, the rare combination of poise, physical ease, leadership vibes and a feeling that this was a footballer yet to reach out into the outer limits of his own grand talent. As Van Dijk prepares for what will be – or would have been, or might still be – a mouthwatering personal battle with Romelu Lukaku, a centre-forward yet to score in six games against him, another very distinct quality stands out. Van Dijk is that genuinely rare thing: the magic-bullet player, the jigsaw-piece signing, a moment of one-man team-completion. Football really doesn’t work like this very often. The variables, 11 to the power of 11, are too vast. The parts are constantly shifting. There is, every time you walk out, an opposition to contend with. One perfect part to complete the perfect team: it just doesn’t happen.
At which point, enter Lukaku, who was also signed, or so it seemed, as the final stroke in some evolving masterplan. Here was a European champion team with one gapingly obvious, forehead-slapping, football-for-dummies hole in its frontline. Just add one cutting-edge centre-forward. Then press go and stand back. How’s that working out, anyway? It is extraordinary to think that in early September Lukaku could be seen fist-pumping and badge-slapping back at the Matthew Harding end as the Chelsea fans sang his name, fresh from terrorising the Aston Villa defence. Fast-forward three months and Lukaku has just given a startlingly tin-eared and, as far as Chelsea’s fans are concerned, bizarrely cold interview to Sky Sports Italy: talking in awed tones of his dream of signing for various other clubs, of his undying love for his previous employers, and threatening to leave because the system isn’t to his liking. There is no doubt that footballers think these things all the time, that they talk like this in private. Football isn’t a cobble-close community fairytale. Players do not ruffle the hair of small boys and girls as they catch the bus to the ground and feel deep in their souls the ties that bind them to these distant global super-clubs. But talking like this in earshot of the people who pay to watch, who just want to dream a little, to believe against all logic that this feeling is mutual, is brutal stuff. He could miss Sunday’s game because of it. However this situation ends up resolving itself, Van Dijk to Liverpool looks a little more stark, even more of an outlier. It is worth remembering that Van Dijk turned up at Anfield looking a little underdone, three weeks since his last game for Southampton. He scored against Everton in that debut game but his next two were defeats by Swansea and West Brom, with Van Dijk a little fogged and rusty, whirling around at times like a man being menaced by a cloud of midges. Steadily something settled. By the end of January there was already a sense of some precision-cut shape being eased into its groove. As winter dissolved into spring, Liverpool set off on that freewheeling run of slightly wild attacking football that took them all the way to the Champions League final, but which also featured 11 clean sheets.
The next two and a half years would bring a Champions League triumph, a Club World Cup gong, a league title and, in Van Dijk’s case, a rare sense of sustained, frictionless excellence; a period bookended by Jordan Pickford’s horrendous assault on his knee in October last year and the nine-month hiatus that followed. Two things stand out now about the golden age of Virgil. First, that Liverpool team was prepped and ready, the system grooved, primed and easily understood. Jürgen Klopp’s centre-backs are asked to defend one on one, to cover the full-backs, to curate that risky high line. Van Dijk was ready for this, a pure central defender in the classic mould, with a rare ability to take defensive soundings, to obsess over details of covering and blocking and marking. Van Dijk has always had a curiosity about systems, a thirst for learning that his earliest coaches noticed. There is a theory he benefited in the long term from the lack of high-end academy training in those slow-burn years, from the need to work the game out for himself. It is a quality he will require once again as he enters another phase in his career. It is still a little startling to witness the moments of everyday slackness that have crept into Van Dijk’s game as Liverpool have struggled to regain their own champion pitch, as the midfield in front of him has shifted, as Van Dijk has searched to regain his explosive agility.
This is perhaps a little unfair. The balance in any team is impossibly delicate. The combination of forces that led to the magic bullet years has been replaced by another haystack of variables. And the default option in football is always uncertainty. Scroll down the list of all-time Premier League signings, through Grealish-Lukaku-Pogba-Maguire-Sancho-Pépé-Arrizabalaga-Havertz, and only one player in the £70m-plus bracket – the Dutchman at No 6 – has managed to escape that sense of make do and mend. If the trip to Chelsea, the duel manqué with Lukaku, tells us anything it is that the golden age of Virgil really was a startlingly rare exception.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/01/romelu-lukaku-virgil-van-dijk-chelsea-liverpool
6075;6075;How much longer can China keep up its zero-Covid strategy?;2022-01-01T17:45:12Z;['Emma Graham-Harrison'];['China', 'Coronavirus', 'Asia Pacific', 'World news'];"Desperate residents in China’s western Xi’an city are running out of food after they were barred from grocery shopping in a fierce lockdown. In the southern province of Guangxi, people who broke Covid laws were recently publicly shamed by being paraded through the streets in Hazmat suits with placards round their necks. The rest of the world is learning, slowly and with some difficulty, to live with Covid-19, but in China, authorities are doubling down on their “zero-Covid” policy: trying to stamp out the disease whenever it appears, and at any cost. A single case in a border town led to 200,000 people being locked down late last month. A key aspect of the policy is border closures. Few people are allowed in or out of China, and those who do enter the country face up three weeks of government-enforced quarantine. Some other countries locked the world out for over a year in a bid to lock out the pandemic. But in 2022, Beijing is treading an increasingly solitary path. A combination of mass vaccination, social pressure and highly transmissible new variants has persuaded other once “zero-Covid” countries – including Australia, New Zealand and Singapore – to begin slowly opening up again to the world. Inside China, some senior scientists and officials have also taken the political risk of calling for similar reopening, in recognition of a world where it seems Covid will become endemic. Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, suggested recently that the country could be ready when vaccination rates pass 85%, perhaps early in 2022. Others have joined scientists abroad, warning that even Beijing’s autocratic powers and popular support for lockdowns and other control measures may not be enough to keep highly transmissible new variants out. “China will have great difficulty with Omicron and a zero Covid policy,” Tulio Oliveira, director of South Africa’s Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation, said on Twitter. He is part of the team that first alerted the World Health Organisation to the new variant. “They may need to join the rest of the world with mitigation strategies. China should not punish its public health officials or citizens or foreigns because (of) a more transmissible variant.” Whatever the cost, China is likely to push extremely hard to keep the virus under control for most of this year, ahead of two high-profile, high-stakes events. Next month, Beijing will host the winter Olympics, a gathering already dogged by diplomatic boycotts over human rights abuses. In the autumn the Communist leadership will meet for their 20th Party Congress: it is expected to officially extend Xi Jinping’s hold on power by another five years. Authorities in Beijing will have little appetite for putting either the Games or the Party Congress in jeopardy with a Covid outbreak, that would amount to an uncontrolled test of the effectiveness of domestic vaccinations and medical preparations.
The health risks of opening China up to Covid are likely to be higher than in countries that abandoned their zero Covid policies, said Sean Yuji Sylvia, assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, whose research focuses on health economics and China’s health system. “There are several reasons why it makes sense for China to maintain strict controls for the time being,” Sylvia said. “China has a high population density and lower herd immunity in the population due to limited exposure to the virus and less-effective vaccines. “The health system is also relatively weak in much of the country and could easily be overwhelmed. And even if vaccines provide good protection against severe cases, patients with less-severe illness are more likely to be hospitalised in China.” The country’s hospitals are also manned by doctors who have little clinical experience of treating Covid, while professionals elsewhere now have two years’ painfully earned understanding of its development and how best to control it. The possible human cost of opening up also has a political dimension. Government and state media have seized on how the virus spread in other countries as evidence of poor leadership and bad decision-making. Abandoning zero Covid could potentially trigger a crisis in hospitals and healthcare that would open the Chinese government to similar criticism. The first few weeks of the pandemic, when hospitals in Wuhan were overwhelmed and the death toll included many medics, fuelled fury and fear nationwide. “China’s zero-Covid policy is driven primarily by social stability concerns. The regime sees Covid, Sars and other epidemics or pandemics as a health crisis that has the potential to evolve into a social crisis,” said Lynette Ong, associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto. “With that in mind, it is not hard to understand why they are willing to defend it at all cost. But the costs are high. As the rest of world learns how to live with it, China will find itself alone, with few coping mechanisms.” A key sign to watch for, she added is whether the approach to Covid shifts after the leadership decisions are made at the Communist Party Congress. Strict controls have been astonishingly effective so far. Over the past four weeks, when China was battling a relatively large cluster of infections by domestic standards, authorities detected 3,400 cases and no one died.
Over the same period, more than 5.7 million people registered Covid infections in the United States, and 36,000 people died of the disease. And as other economies crumbled under the pressure of deaths and lockdowns, China continued to grow But if its path continues to diverge from the rest of the world’s, the costs and challenges of the zero-Covid approach are almost certain to rise. In 2020 and 2021, once China stamped out its initial outbreak, domestic spending picked up. Its factories resumed churning out goods for the world, adding Covid tests and other medical gear to their production line, for a pandemic that seemed to be passing the country by. Now however, the economic calculus has become more complicated. Strict new lockdown and quarantine rules are affecting everything from global supply chains – as sailors wanting to return home must spend weeks in isolation – to factory output. Trade partners are angry at the impact of suddenly imposed new border controls, with more than 6,000 Vietnamese trucks suddenly stranded at one border in late December. If other markets continue to ease Covid-related controls on movement while China remains shuttered, they may be forced to look elsewhere for trade partners.. If Beijing remains sealed off from the world, this may also diminish China’s efforts to project its influence worldwide. This has been a high profile feature of Xi Jinping’s increasingly assertive rule, including his flagship “Belt and Road” initiative, offering investment and aid around the world.
But for now, authorities have clearly prioritised the political advantages of a Covid-free China, and are willing to pay a very high price to keep that unusual status in a world where the disease is becoming endemic. “China’s ‘dynamic clearance’ strategy has thus far proven effective at limiting the domestic spread of the disease, albeit with significant cost, effort, and trade-offs,” said Thomas Hale, associate professor in public policy at Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Governance. “The government’s statements since the emergence of Omicron –which have touted the present strategy as a success – suggest that the point of transition (away from zero Covid) is not close, despite some discussion of this in the Chinese media. “Moreover, when it does come, the transition may not be easy because Chinese society has gotten quite used to a low level of transmission.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/china-zero-covid-strategy-beijing-policy-protecting-public-health-coronavirus
6076;6076;Speaker defends Tony Blair knighthood after backlash;2022-01-01T17:32:31Z;['Vanessa Thorpe'];['Tony Blair', 'New Year honours list', 'Honours system', 'Politics', 'UK news'];The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair’s ennoblement this weekend, courtesy of the Queen, has been defended by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Sir Tony, rather than Sir Anthony, as he is now known, has been made a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, 14 years after leaving Downing Street. But the honour has been criticised by Blair’s political opponents and those who argue the legacy of his invasion of Iraq in 2003 makes him unsuitable. Speaking on Saturday morning Hoyle said he felt the honour, the oldest and most senior British order of chivalry, was “a fitting tribute” for a former prime minister, although he felt it was not a political decision. “Whatever people might think, it is one of the toughest jobs in the world,” the Speaker said, “and I think it is respectful and it is the right thing to do, whether it is Sir David Cameron. They should all be offered that knighthood when they finish as prime minister.” Hoyle was talking to Today programme presenter Martha Kearney on BBC Radio 4 when he was asked if he believed all recent former prime ministers should now be knighted. “If you have been prime minister of this country, I do believe the country should recognise the service given. Absolutely. You finish in the office and when you’ve finished it is the respect that we give to those prime ministers,” he replied. Most attacks on the monarch’s appointment of Blair to the order, membership of which was also given on Saturday to Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and to the former Labour cabinet member Lady Amos, the first black person to be honoured this way, have come from the political left, but were picked up by right-leaning media, including the Daily Mail. The newspaper said there had been backlash, quoting satirical tweets from the veteran investigative journalist John Pilger and from former MP George Galloway. Appointments to this ceremonial order are made without prime ministerial advice and are usually announced on St George’s Day, on 23 April. Founded in 1348 by Edward III, it is the oldest and most senior British Order of Chivalry and a recognition of significant public service. Sir John Major, Blair’s predecessor, was the last prime minister to receive the honour. “It is not about politics. It is about the position they have held in this country and it’s the respect that we show to those and it is a fitting tribute,” said Hoyle. • This article was amended on 6 January 2022 to clarify that Sir John Major was the last prime minister to receive the honour.;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/speaker-defends-tony-blair-knighthood-after-backlash
6077;6077;Davinson Sánchez breaks Watford’s resolve with 96th-minute Spurs winner;2022-01-01T17:11:05Z;['Jonathan Wilson'];['Premier League', 'Watford', 'Tottenham Hotspur', 'Football', 'Sport'];"New year, new dawn? As it turned out, not quite. For a long time, it seemed that history might be made at Vicarage Road on Saturday – a first clean sheet for Claudio Ranieri as Watford manager, his first Premier League clean sheet for three years and three days. Watford have had five managers since they last kept a Premier League clean sheet and Davinson Sánchez’s injury-time winner means that number could soon increase to six. Six points from 11 games since Ranieri took over is not an encouraging stat for Watford. For the Italian, pretty much all that can be said is that his win percentage is higher than it was during his disastrous stint in charge of Fulham – although anything but a win at Newcastle in a fortnight would change that. Ranieri lasted three months and two weeks at Fulham; he would have to survive beyond 18 January for his Watford reign to last longer.
While there have been the remarkable victories over Everton and Manchester United, it’s very hard to argue that there has been an improvement since Ranieri replaced Xisco Muñoz at the beginning of October. This was Watford’s sixth defeat in a row; an unprecedented run of poor form under the Pozzos. “I am very proud,” said Ranieri. “Also our fans should be proud because the team played a fight until the end. What was unbelievable was to concede a goal with a header with all our tall players. We are alive! We will survive!” Given present form, that seemed an optimistic take. From a clean sheet, though, could perhaps have grown belief – and there had not been much of that at kick-off. Rather there was a sense for much of the first half of an acceptance of fate, something encapsulated by the sight of Harry the Hornet forlornly banging a drum in the corner to general indifference. Perhaps the hundreds of empty seats were down primarily to Covid, the complications of festive travel and new year hangovers, but it can’t help that this Watford offer so little incentive to make an effort. Until João Pedro came on to offer a threat with his direct running, there was a grim meekness to Watford. Their resistance consisted largely in simply being: existing in a relatively organised 4-4-2. But again and again possession was wasted. Clearance after clearance went to a Spurs player or out of play. Pass after pass was misplaced. And the result was that Spurs kept coming in wave after wave. Perhaps this was defiance but it was the defiance of an unremarkable sandstone cliff against the sea: eventually erosion was always going to take its course.
Not that Tottenham offered much. Like so many high-pressing teams, they are at their best against sides who come out at them, which Watford, with their two banks of four dropped deep, simply didn’t do. This was similar to the Southampton game, as Spurs lacked the creative spark to break through against increasingly dogged opponents. Forced to try to play their way through an opponent or to rely on the wayward crossing of Emerson Royal, Tottenham looked a little one-paced and lacking in imagination. “It was difficult because we didn’t score but created chances and when you find an opponent who is well organised it is not simple,” said Antonio Conte. “When we find a very narrow team we have to improve.” And that perhaps suggests the limitations of this squad. For all Tottenham have improved under Conte, for all they look better organised and more motivated, they remain the same group of players, and they are a group that, since the departure of Christian Eriksen, has lacked much in the way of magic or unpredictability. Tanguy Ndombele has at times suggested he could provide it, but Conte made fairly clear this week that he is no fan: Ndombele’s unpredictability is the wrong kind of unpredictability.
Conte’s importance is obvious. As the game was delayed with five minutes remaining while a fan received treatment in the Graham Taylor Stand, he gathered his players and issued yet further instructions. When the game began again, Spurs came with renewed vigour, earning them the free-kick wide on the left that Son Heung-min arced in for Sánchez to glance home. A win is a win and it lifted Spurs, despite their shortcomings, to within two points of Arsenal with two games in hand. Watford, meanwhile, are sinking fast and under the Pozzos, that usually means only one thing. Ranieri, it feels, is already on borrowed time.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/watford-tottenham-premier-league-match-report
6078;6078;It’s hard to ‘level up’ when No 10 is always bearing down on everyone;2022-01-01T17:00:08Z;['Phillip Inman'];['Economics', 'Michael Gove', 'Devolution', 'Local government', 'Business', 'Politics', 'Society', 'Sadiq Khan', 'Conservatives', 'London'];"Michael Gove, in his new role as the cabinet’s major-domo and minister in charge of “levelling up”, is about to expend large amounts of intellectual and political capital attempting to close the gap between the south-east and everywhere else. Levelling up, as we are told repeatedly by No 10, will be the defining achievement of the Johnson administration and 2022 is the year that efforts to transform the much-neglected regions begin to gather pace. With this in mind, Gove is about to publish a white paper that outlines how the government plans to tackle this gargantuan task. So far the prospects for a major commitment across Whitehall are looking slim. The chancellor, for one, wants to make sure that whatever Gove wants comes with no new cash attached. Recycling is popular in government, especially when it concerns money. Gove’s response appears to be a renewed focus on the bureaucracy supporting the regions. He has floated a scheme to fill the geographical gaps between the metro mayors who run most of England’s big city regions with a new concept of US-style regional governors. There is no suggestion of mimicking the neo-colonial mini-White Houses that host governors in most US state capitals – just a network of elected chiefs able to reduce regional inequalities and drive growth around the country. Gove’s mistake here is his apparent determination to join the list of reformers who focus more on structures than desired outcomes. One advantage he can claim as he prepares to confront the many entrenched and powerful interests in the shires (which dominate the Conservative party apparatus and will object to governors) is the lack of agreement among political opponents on an alternative to whatever structure he puts forward.
Labour and the thinktanks that feed ideas to shadow ministers agree on one thing – that extra funds and power should be devolved away from Whitehall. But they have not found an alternative system of local democracy to coalesce around since John Prescott’s proposal for regional assemblies was crushed in a referendum held in north-east England almost 20 years ago. And there is good reason. As Prescott found out, extra layers of government appear to the public as civil-service employment schemes. Even sharp-shooting governors can quickly look like jobsworths to those who see themselves as taxpayers first and citizens second. Labour is rightly more concerned with issues that Gove wants to sidestep, such as how to foster more productive regional economic engines based on a collaboration of public and private capital. The access to private capital in England’s north-east, north-west and south-west, where a lack of finance cripples businesses’ ambitions, is so much more important than having a go-getting governor. And what about health outcomes and education, which have improved by leaps and bounds in London and the south-east over the last 20 years, while standards have stagnated or gone backwards in other parts of the country? From George Osborne’s elected mayors to Gove’s planned overhaul, debates about the efficient and functional management of English territory have always taken precedence over questions such as how to determine and represent local political identities in a way that increases levels of participation, accountability and legitimacy. These issues underpin economic success because they give individuals and communities a sense of respect and control. Gove wants the eventual model for the whole country to be London, which, he says, under Labour and Conservative mayors has set out strategic goals, giving coherence to the revitalisation and regeneration of large parts of the capital. The latest of those mayors, Sadiq Khan, says these statements ring hollow. He told the Observer: “The government is saying to all other parts of the country they will have a London-style transport system. But London doesn’t have a London-style transport system and that is because these days the government is micro-managing what we can and can’t do. “Whether you are Andy Burnham or Andy Street, Jamie Driscoll in the north-east or Dan Jarvis in Sheffield, it is clear more powers should be devolved. But the control freakery of the government, with ministers hoarding power rather than giving it away, is overwhelming.” Economic studies show that only a greater degree of autonomy can generate higher and more sustainable growth rates, and that such progress is only seen over long periods of time. So why should anyone put their faith in governors when the template for them, the London mayor, is cut off at the knees, denied not only the cash needed to do anything meaningful, but with Whitehall breathing down his neck? If Gove cannot enhance local democracy and accept all that it entails, then governors and much else he proposes will be window dressing for an administration that is levelling down. • This article was amended on 2 January 2022. The referendum on a regional assembly for north-east England was held in 2004, not “more than 25 years ago” as an earlier version said due to an error introduced during editing.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/01/its-hard-to-level-up-when-no-10-is-always-bearing-down-on-everyone
6079;6079;"The week in audio: Four Peaks Sound Walk; Desert Island Discs; A Tribute to Janice Long; Christmas Takeover";2022-01-01T17:00:08Z;['Miranda Sawyer'];['Radio', 'Desert Island Discs', 'Music radio', 'Culture', 'Podcasts'];"Four Peaks Sound Walk (Radio 3) | BBC Sounds Desert Island Discs: Richard Osman (Radio 4) | BBC Sounds A Tribute to Janice Long (BBC Radio Wales) | BBC Sounds Christmas Takeover (Radio 1) | BBC Sounds Radio 3’s Four Peaks Sound Walk, which went out on Christmas Day and the following three days, initially seemed like a strange yuletide-to-new-year offering. Each programme was based around a walk to the top of the highest peak in each of the four nations of the UK. Presenter Horatio Clare, producer Jeremy Evans and sound engineer Andy Fell all tramped to the top of Ben Nevis, Slieve Donard, Scafell Pike and Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), through cawing birds, shifting landscapes, capricious mountain weather and varying amounts of fellow climbers (hardly any on Slieve Donard, hordes on Ben Nevis). The shows mixed the airy, rainy sounds of the walks with Clare’s observations, reminiscences and recounting of myths. Music was added too, some of which was a little on the nose (classical strings and “bom-bom” drums pull me out of, rather than bring me into an atmosphere), though most was a lovely addition. And Clare is such a wonderful presenter, his occasional exertion-caused breathiness somehow enhancing his gorgeous way with words. I loved his tale-telling: the stories of the to and fro between Irish clan leader Donard and Christian arriviste Saint Patrick; Clare’s own childhood memories of going crabbing with “the Welsh Cézanne”, Kyffin Williams, “a real druid figure with a white moustache and gentle manner”. Clare has a gentle manner, his clipped, polite greetings to other walkers – “Hello there… Hi… Hello” – making me giggle on occasion.
Anyhow, the strangeness I mention is not in the programmes themselves, which were eerie and moving, but not weird. It’s in their timing. The Sound Walks were such determinedly open-aired, misty skied affairs, offered at a time when most of us were huggermugger in one warm room, stretching our legs only to shuffle to the kettle or fridge – though perhaps that was the point. I listened when I went out to walk the dog, tramping around a cramped, urban landscape immersed in the sounds of a vast, wilder one. Surprisingly, the shows proved a perfect accompaniment to a small life; contemplative and human, with a strong connection to the past and to the Earth itself. You need headphones and solitude for their full effect.
Another exceptionally human listen was Richard Osman on Desert Island Discs. Much of what he said in his interview with Lauren Laverne has already been filleted for newspaper headlines, as Osman is now a national treasure, but it’s worth hearing him talk, especially about how his life has been enhanced by TV. He has nystagmus, an eye condition that means his vision is often blurred, and his description of how telly opened up the world, visually, for him was very affecting. His self-knowledge meant he was an excellent interviewee, despite his naturally private nature, and he talked interestingly about his food addiction, his mum, his brilliant and interesting career. You sensed a deep emotional swirl within him that remained carefully contained; a desire to give and receive love bubbling just beneath that calm, witty surface. A lovely person to spend 45 minutes with. Janice Long, who died on Christmas Day at the terribly young age of 66, was never anything other than a lovely person to spend time with. Her presenting career took her to Radio 1 and Top of the Pops (she’s one of the few hosts still bearable to watch on the reruns), as well as Radio 2 and 6 Music. And she was still going strong: she hosted on Saturdays on Greatest Hits Radio and had a weekday evening show on Radio Wales. Long’s producer at Radio Wales, Adam Walton, pulled together a moving celebration of her life in music, which aired on Monday, just two days after she died.
He played music by some of the many bands Long had championed during her career, and spoke to several musicians, including Holly Johnson and Ian McCulloch. Walton hosted too, which must have been difficult, as he was very upset by his friend’s death. He almost lost it on several occasions, including during a link between Trampolene’s Beautiful Pain and the Smiths’ There Is a Light, as did I. But the programme he made for Long and her fans was a beautiful tribute to an exceptionally endearing person. “There was no side to her,” said Johnson. “She was ambitious, but it wasn’t at the expense of anyone.” Very true. In the 80s, Long was not treated particularly well at Radio 1, where she became persona non grata when she dared to have a child. Such discriminatory days are in the past, thank goodness, and it was great to hear plenty of diverse young talent on the station throughout the week. For the past couple of years, between Boxing Day and New Year’s Day, Radio 1 has given new presenters a chance to host a show in its week-long Christmas Takeover. Last week, we heard from 30 new DJs. Every one was remarkably upbeat and capable, even though they were given only short opportunities to speak: a little reading out of what listeners are up to, a spot of throwing to the news. But it was terrifically exciting for the presenters, and you could hear those with a spark enliven these small speaking roles. Plus, as they were all playing nailed-on bangers, every show was an easy, not too chatty listen.

6080;6080;Sands of time are slipping away for England’s crumbling coasts amid climate crisis;2022-01-01T17:00:07Z;['Andrew Anthony'];['Climate crisis', 'Norfolk', 'UK news', 'Science', 'Wildlife', 'Environment', 'Flooding', 'Coastlines'];"From a distance, the beach at Winterton-on-sea in Norfolk looks like the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, with hundreds of grey bodies lying motionless across the sand. On closer inspection, it becomes clear they are not fallen soldiers but a huge colony of seals taken to the land for pupping season. It’s an amazing annual sight that draws tourists and nature-lovers from across the country, but another process is taking place that is pushing people back – the growing threat of coastal erosion. Just along from where the armies of grey seals lay with their white pups, there used to stand the Dunes Cafe, a much-loved beach facility with a large and loyal clientele. A year ago it was demolished to prevent its imminent collapse as a result of land lost to sea and storms. The ground where it stood is, like the cafe itself, no longer there. It’s a story of disappearance taking place all along the eastern coast of England, but particularly in East Anglia, that bulbous protrusion jutting into the North Sea. That climate change and rising sea levels take their toll on the landscape is an old story, but one with an urgent new twist. “The sea level’s been rising since the last ice age, 20,000 years ago or so,” says Jim Hall, professor of climate and environmental risk at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute. “And it’s going faster. We’re probably not seeing its effect very much yet on the coast, though we will in the future.”
A 2020 report by the Committee on Climate Change, on which Hall sits as an expert on coastal erosion and flooding, found 1.2m homes at significant risk of flooding and a further 100,000 subject to coastal erosion by 2080 – which, although it sounds safely distant, will be within the lifetime of most of those born so far this century. Two years ago, the US-based climate change research group Climate Central went further. It produced a map showing areas of the UK at risk of being underwater by 2050. They included sections of north Norfolk, all of the Lincolnshire coast and much of Cambridgeshire, along with parts of East Yorkshire, Merseyside and the Bristol area. According to the group, this would happen even if “moderate” attempts were made to combat climate change. Such predictions are based on highly complex, and disputed, modelling, yet there are significant warning signs that such an outcome is growing rapidly more plausible. Last month, scientists monitoring the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica, an ice shelf the size of Great Britain, warned it is in danger of collapse. “It’s being melted from below by warm ocean waters, causing it to lose its grip on the underwater mountain,” said Peter Davis from British Antarctic Survey and the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. He said research suggested that the ice shelf will begin to break apart within two decades. Should there be a complete collapse, it would lead to a highly consequential rise in sea levels of 60cm. That may be a worst-case scenario, but it will almost certainly have a notable impact on the British coastline.
In a sense Norfolk is a real-time lesson in how weather and sea can drastically alter a landscape. After the Dunes Cafe was dismantled, a chef called Alex Clare set up a mobile silver Airstream cafe to cater to locals and visitors at the car park next to where the cafe once stood. He’s had to move the Airstream four times in eight months, as sections of the dunes on which the car park sits have collapsed into the sea under pressure from storms and high tides. “In the last two weeks,” Clare told me, “a strip about as long as this caravan has disappeared. You hear about erosion, but you don’t know what it means, what it involves, until you witness it. And it’s a shock to see the physical transformation.” The car park owner has tried to slow the erosion by laying down large concrete blocks on the beach, but it’s the definition of a losing battle. Winterton’s coast possesses a bleak beauty, enhanced by the fact that the village sits back from the sea, behind a broad wall of dunes. By contrast, at Hemsby, a mile or so south, the town, with its amusement arcades and fairgrounds, stretches all the way to the shoreline. Four years ago, there was a line of seven chalets close to the edge of the sandy cliffs that drop down to the beach. They all had to be knocked down as the land beneath them began to fall into the sea. The local council is looking at sea defences, but the only workable answer involves large-scale investment and a major process of sandscaping. That is what took place at Bacton, 15 miles north along the coast from Winterton.
A four-mile-long dune was built to protect Bacton Terminal, which supplies around a third of the UK’s gas and had been moving steadily closer to the cliff edge, literally and metaphorically. Designed by the Dutch engineering company Royal HaskoningDHV, it involved the placement of 1.8 million cubic metres of sand along the beaches near the terminal. The design relies on the sand being shifted into place by wind, waves and tides. The Dutch are world leaders in land reclamation and protection, having over the years reclaimed more than a sixth of Holland’s landmass from the sea. “In the long run,” says Professor Hall, “any coast protection is temporary. We’ve been doing engineering to protect the coast for a very long time. Almost half of the UK coast has some kind of protection – sea walls, revetments, promenades, that kind of thing. The Victorians were inveterate promenade builders.” Such protections don’t stop the sea rising. They merely fix, for a while, the point of the shore profile. At Happisburgh, near Bacton, wooden revetments did that job, until they collapsed 20 years ago, leading to a sudden and damaging exposure to the sea. “Once you lose [the protection], there’s a lot of pent-up erosion capacity,” says Hall. Although there is growing media coverage of coastal erosion, it’s as Alex Clare said: knowledge of the thing isn’t the same as experiencing it. “There’s a bit more recognition that the sea level is rising fast,” says Hall. “But I don’t think coastal communities have really understood what the future holds.” He believes there should be an “honest conversation” between government, local government and the affected communities.
While the money required to protect cities like London and Hull will have to be found, that’s not likely with isolated villages. When I visited Norfolk last month, the locals seemed fatalistic or in denial, pointing out that the situation was worse somewhere else, either up or down the coast. As I drove back, it began to rain, and that night the weather deteriorated. The next day there was a large landslide at Mundesley, near Bacton, with a huge chunk of the cliff face collapsing on to the beach. Above it, houses stood on the precipice, their future looking about as secure as Norwich’s position in the Premier League. As Pete Revell, station manager at Bacton HM Coastguard, said, Mundesley was viewed as stable by comparison with nearby Happisburgh, and the landslide came as “a bit of a surprise”. It certainly shocked local resident Antony Lloyd, who said he was “very nervous and agitated about any further incidents.” He was finding it hard to sleep and thought he would have to move. Of course, the occasional landfall or loss of beachside chalets is hardly cause for national panic. But like canaries in a coal mine, the inhabitants of the villages strung along Norfolk’s shifting coastline are a warning of a worrying future. There are processes under way whose outcomes are unavoidable, and those that can potentially be arrested. But it will require unblinking foresight and long-term action, neither of which are our national strong suits. If you take the path north from Winterton’s beach car park you come to the roped-off seal sanctuary. Beyond, seals and their pups lie still and vulnerable in the dunes, hundreds of yards from the shore, as if waiting for the sea to rescue them. And come it will, not now or next year, but much sooner than we care to think.";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/01/sands-slip-england-crumbling-coasts-erosion-rising-sea-levels
6081;6081;Notre Dame Disneyfied? Unlikely, but the devil will be in the detail | Rowan Moore;2022-01-01T17:00:07Z;['Rowan Moore'];['Notre Dame', 'UK news', 'Coronavirus', 'BBC', 'Media', 'Ghislaine Maxwell'];"There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth a few weeks ago when the Daily Telegraph announced that the renovation of the fire-ravaged Notre Dame cathedral would turn it into a “politically correct Disneyland”. As so often when that august publication buckles on its cuirass and bascinet in the War on Woke, it helps to look closely at its sources and evidence. In this case, it relied on the opinions of a conservative architect called Maurice Culot and sight of rather general proposals to install “modern art murals” in some of the side chapels and to project quotes from the Bible in languages that include Mandarin. A more measured and informed article in the Washington Post, by the art historian Elizabeth Lev, later pointed out that these chapels were formerly “an ill-kept hodgepodge generally passed over by tourists” and there should be nothing very terrible about a cathedral communicating the scriptures in the world’s leading languages. France’s National Heritage and Architecture Commission has since backed the proposals, with a couple of reservations. The work might yet be clumsy and inane or beautiful and thoughtful – it’s just that convincing evidence of its monstrosity hasn’t been produced by its detractors. The devil, so to speak, will be in the detail. Form over function
Cedric Price was an architect and thinker whose insights, more than 18 years after his death, continue to resonate. One of these was to challenge the assumption of architects and their clients that erecting a building is the best solution to a given problem. A big shiny structure called The Centre for Ending Poverty (to use a hypothetical example) might not actually do what it claims. Price’s wisdom is pertinent to the saga of the Nightingale hospitals, the facilities created with much fanfare and expense early in the pandemic, which treated fewer than 400 patients. Now Sajid Javid is doubling down on this less than triumphant idea by ordering eight “Nightingale surge hubs” – units in hospital car parks to deal with a possible wave of Omicron admissions. One obvious but unanswered question is where the staff might come from to run these hubs. Even more obviously, would it not have been better to implement policies that reduce this potential surge, so that the Nightingales would not be needed at all? BBC morals off course
I imagine the BBC’s moral compass to be a handsome and substantial instrument, brass-trimmed and Latin-inscribed, kept in a Reithian marble vault deep in Broadcasting House. It seems, though, that someone has tunnelled into its vicinity and placed a powerful electromagnet there, one programmed to switch on and off to an unpredictable synth funk beat. How else to explain its decision to interview Alan Dershowitz as an apparently objective commentator on the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, in particular on the credibility of the couple’s victim Virginia Giuffre? Dershowitz, as the BBC failed to mention, was one of Epstein’s lawyers and associates and is himself embroiled in lawsuits with Giuffre over her accusations that he was another of her abusers. In 2020, he wrote an article in the Spectator, “The Ghislaine Maxwell I know”, which attacked the “one-sided narrative” of “lying witnesses” such as Giuffre. The case against Maxwell, he sagely concluded, “is far from over”. The BBC acknowledged its error, but why make it in the first place? In case my electromagnet theory is not strictly accurate, here’s another: the corporation is now so thoroughly browbeaten and disoriented by accusations of liberal bias that it truly doesn’t know north from south and east from west. • Rowan Moore is the Observer’s architecture correspondent";https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/01/notre-dame-disneyfied-unlikely-devil-in-detail
6082;6082;Arsenal bemoan VAR inconsistency after ‘clear penalty’ denied in City defeat;2022-01-01T16:37:42Z;['Nick Ames'];['Arsenal', 'Manchester City', 'Football', 'Sport'];"Arsenal were left nursing a sense of injustice after VAR decisions contributed to their dramatic 2-1 defeat against Manchester City, with their assistant manager, Albert Stuivenberg, suggesting they had been denied a “clear penalty” when Martin Ødegaard was challenged by Ederson in the first half. Stuivenberg was overseeing Arsenal in the absence of Mikel Arteta, who looked on from home after testing positive for Covid-19. He and his players felt the referee, Stuart Attwell, should have been asked to review Ederson’s tackle on the monitor, just as he did when awarding City the second-half spot kick from which Riyad Mahrez equalised.
“I think it is a clear penalty, but at least a moment for the referee to check, like what happened with their penalty,” Stuivenberg said. “It is inconsistent.” Aaron Ramsdale, the Arsenal goalkeeper, was similarly confused after seeing City’s penalty appeal at close quarters. Attwell originally awarded nothing when Bernardo Silva went down under Granit Xhaka’s challenge but when invited to review the decision by the VAR official, Jarred Gillett, he changed his mind. “I don’t know why the referee is told to see one and not the other,” Ramsdale said. “It is there for a reason, go and use it. It is the inconsistency. The whole point is to help the game out. In real time it didn’t look like one, [but] slow it down on a screen and it is given.” Despite their frustration at not being awarded a penalty, Arsenal surged ahead later in the first half through Bukayo Saka and were by far the better side before Mahrez levelled. The equaliser was followed quickly by a second yellow card for Gabriel Magalhães, whose first was for what Stuivenberg termed a “normal comment … no dirty language was used”, and Arsenal paid the price through Rodri’s late winner. “I’m sad that we don’t end up with three points, that’s the most frustrating part,” Stuivenberg said. Ramsdale agreed: “I don’t think for large parts of the game teams have done that to Manchester City.”
An 11th straight win for City gives them an 11-point advantage at the top, although Chelsea and Liverpool have opportunities to reduce it with games in hand. There have been two bigger gaps on New Year’s Day in the Premier League era. Pep Guardiola accepted City had been fortunate. “Arsenal were better,” he said, before pointing out that City had two days to recover from their win at Brentford. “It was so tough for us to come back. We had no energy. We were incredibly tired and they were better, but football has happened and sometimes it comes in our side.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/arsenal-bemoan-var-inconsistency-after-clear-penalty-denied-in-city-defeat
6083;6083;You don’t need to travel long distances to spot birds, Britain’s twitchers urged;2022-01-01T16:30:07Z;['James Tapper'];['Birdwatching', 'Climate crisis', 'Birds', 'RSPB', 'Environment', 'Wildlife', 'Animals', 'UK news', 'Life and style', 'Hobbies', 'Conservation'];"Twitching is synonymous with birdwatching, which can often involve long journeys in search of rare species. But now a new breed of climate-conscious birder is trying to persuade fellow enthusiasts to keep it local instead. A group of young birders has created a challenge for spotters to find birds in their own patch close to home rather than routinely travelling long distances to spot particular birds, a practice known as “twitching”. The Green Patch Challenge, created by Joe Parham, a 22-year-old birder from the Midlands, invites under-25s to attempt to travel only on foot or by bike to see birds. “We all need to make changes to our lives to address the climate crisis, and the goal of the challenge is to capture this while encouraging young birders to explore and enjoy nature close to them,” Parham said. “It’s not about stopping everything. It’s about making positive changes, doing much less travelling and when you do it, try to do it low-carbon.” Birdwatching has been growing in popularity in the UK and there was a lockdown boom last year when numbers taking part in the RSPB’s annual garden survey, where people report which birds they can see in their gardens, jumped by 85%. About three million people do some birdwatching every year. The Green Patch Challenge has been followed up by Birdwatch magazine, which set its readers a #LocalBigYear challenge for 2022, inviting birders to find species in patches within 10km of their home. The challenges harness the passion that most birders – whether twitchers or patchers – have for drawing up lists of birds they’ve seen. Many have overlapping lists of birds seen in their back garden, in their county, in the UK or the rest of the world. The lists can be quite competitive – on New Year’s Day, many birders began their year list by trying to see as many birds as possible on their patch. At peak migration times, some twitchers travel almost every week to see rare birds, a practice that is increasingly under fire from some parts of the birding community. In November, about 100 birders travelled to Papa Westray, one of the smallest of the Orkney islands, to see a varied thrush – a bird usually seen only in north America and last spotted in the UK in 1982. Some chartered planes and boats to reach the island for the sighting. Javier Caletrío, a researcher based in north-west England, set up the Low Carbon Birding blog in 2018 to try to persuade birdwatchers to travel less. He said it was important for birders to set an example. “If people see us acting as if there is a crisis requiring immediate action, it is more likely that others will also demand urgent, radical action from politicians.” Birding was often dominated by stories about “the excitement of travelling to distant places and seeing rare and exotic birds” he said. “These young people are telling other young people that they can be good birders and have fun without travelling to distant places by means of burning fossil fuels. And obviously low-carbon birding is not about the end of travel. It is about doing it differently – planning your holidays differently and making the most of public transport.” Matthew Broadbent, 20, who helps run the Green Patch Challenge, said: “I know the feeling when you see a stunning, rare bird, and it’s fantastic. It’s a buzz, and makes you want more. But we need to learn to travel shorter distances to see birds, we need to do what we can to protect our planet.” Keir Chauhan, 19, began birding seriously in 2020 and said that joining the Green Patch Challenge in north London had changed his life during the lockdowns. “It provided an outlet,” he said. “If I’d had a bad day, I’d go looking for a new bird around Ally Pally.” A pair of peregrine falcons haunts the BBC signal tower on Alexandra Palace. “It’s amazing to watch them hunt in the mornings, chasing the crows,” he said.
“There’s a reservoir near there and most of the time there’s no birds whatsoever. But one time I saw a kestrel land and it turned out they were nesting there. Even in a place as birdless as that – it’s not a foreign country, it’s not a nature reserve – you can see interesting birds.” Stephen Moss, a lifelong birder and author, whose book, Skylarks with Rosie, charts the lockdown birdwatching he did in the patch near his Somerset home, said that making local observations had an important ecological purpose as it enabled research into the prevalence of bird species. “Low-carbon birding is clearly a good idea,” Moss said, “but some people are arguing that we should not be doing any long-distance trips – Chris Packham said he’s never going to do it again. “But there are places like Costa Rica, the Gambia, Trinidad and Tobago, or Kenya where vast amounts of its economy comes from wildlife tourism. We need to find the right balance between the local and global.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/01/travel-distances-britain-twitchers-birds-birdwatchers-species-foot-cycle
6084;6084;Grief, needle phobia, lack of trust: why we refused Covid jabs – and what changed our minds;2022-01-01T16:24:16Z;"[""Euan O'Byrne Mulligan"", 'Rachel Obordo']";['Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'Health', 'Life and style', 'Society', 'Vaccines and immunisation', 'Infectious diseases'];"The UK’s vaccine rollout has largely been a success: more than 90% of the population aged 12 and over has now had at least one dose, with just over half having had a second dose and the booster. However, there are thousands of people who still haven’t had a jab, despite estimates suggesting that 90% of the most severely ill Covid patients in hospital at the moment are unvaccinated. A number of strategies are being employed to convince those who have so far avoided it get vaccinated, with outreach groups and GPs working to encourage take-up. The Observer spoke to three people who have, in recent weeks, changed their minds. Here, they explain their initial hesitancy and the reasons for their change of heart. Jess Haghkerdar, 32 PhD student, Fife Ecology student Jess said she “wasn’t against the vaccine” and had received her first and second doses. But she had decided not to get the booster. In August 2021, shortly after having her second jab, she had a miscarriage at eight weeks pregnant. “I was worried the vaccine had contributed to my miscarriage and became wary of getting a booster once I found out I was pregnant again” she said. She considered waiting until she had given birth to have her booster, but the became concerned about Omicron and about the number of unvaccinated pregnant women ending up in intensive care. “I realised that my hesitance was based on grief and worry,” she said. “Just looking at the data proved that Covid is a much greater risk than any of my worst fears about the vaccine affecting my pregnancy.” She changed her mind and had the booster. “I don’t want to get Covid while I am pregnant and be in a situation that could potentially be harmful to me and the baby. “I’m a scientist and I know that if there was something seriously wrong with the vaccines, fellow scientists would stop at nothing to discover it and improve our understanding of them. “I understand the visceral response and fear of vaccination, but we need to be realistic about how serious Covid can be and recognise how hard scientists and doctors have worked to keep us safe. No matter how I look at it now, getting vaccinated is worth it.” Kevin Buckland, 46 PhD student and university lecturer, Sutton Coldfield Kevin has had a phobia of needles from an early age. “I just hate them. I forged my mum’s signature when I was 14 to avoid getting the TB vaccination, saying she didn’t want me to have it. They wrote to her six months later, I was found out, and they dragged me into Birmingham kicking and screaming to have it.”
His plan was to remain unvaccinated, taking precautions to avoid infecting himself and his elderly parents, who live nearby. The emergence of the Omicron variant made Kevin reassess his approach, as he was concerned by its rate of transmission. “I was reading that just a whiff of an infected person’s breath would be enough to contract it. I’ve dodged it for this length of time and thought, how much longer can I go on? “I booked an appointment about a month ago and chickened out. I then rearranged that one and finally went along. I just concentrated on the fact that it was a good thing. I hardly slept the night before. “On the day, I didn’t even realise she had done it. It helped that I walked into the place not wearing glasses so I couldn’t see anything anyway. There was one person taking my details, the other had a hypodermic needle. “I was talking to the one with a laptop about my phobia and, without me noticing, it was done. I didn’t feel a thing. I have my second booked for February and plan to get a booster.” Adam, 26, from Cheshire Adam (not his real name) lost faith in the government in 2020, largely because of Dominic Cummings and the Barnard Castle affair. “I just thought if they can lie about something of this magnitude, what else can they lie about?” He then became sceptical because of the speed of the vaccination programme rollout. “I felt like it was quite rushed to begin with. There wasn’t much research published or data coming out, which led me to believe that it was being pushed out for other reasons – not just to save lives, but to save the economy, which to some extent I understand, but I feel like saving lives is much more important. Damage to the economy can be repaired, but you can’t bring back someone who has passed away.” Over time Adam, who works for his family’s wealth management business, came to believe in the benefits of vaccination by following hospitalisation figures in trusted news sources.
“I was hesitant about getting my first vaccine, which I didn’t have until about three months ago. I had my second dose three weeks ago. “The hospitalisation numbers for people who were vaccinated compared with people who were unvaccinated were scary. At the same time, I felt like there was a bit more control on the misinformation that was being put out there. “The information that was published was worrying, so I thought it was best in the long run to get the vaccine, rather than not, despite what my feelings were at the time.”";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/needle-phobia-refused-covid-jabs-refuseniks-vaccination
6085;6085;As a new year dawns expect a fresh assault on big tech | John Naughton;2022-01-01T16:00:07Z;['John Naughton'];['Internet', 'Facebook', 'Google', 'Science', 'Computing', 'Technology', 'Social networking', 'Consciousness'];"The thing about history is that it sometimes repeats itself. As far as the tech industry is concerned, we saw that in the year just ended and it looks as though we’re about to see it again in the year that’s just begun. First things first, though: 2021 was the year in which it finally became clear that the free ride that Google and co have enjoyed for two decades was coming to an end – that tech was going to become a regulated industry. Exactly how that was going to pan out was unclear, but the direction of travel was unmistakable. In the US, for example, the incoming Biden administration began appointing to government smart people who understood the societal dangers of unrestrained corporate power. People such as Lina Khan, who now chairs the Federal Trade Commission, the country’s main regulatory body; or Tim Wu, now on the White House’s National Economic Council with responsibility for antitrust and competition; or Jonathan Kanter, a leading antitrust advocate, now assistant attorney general. And so on. Given that all the leading tech companies are US-based, these were the most significant moves, but there were indications in other parts of the world too (including the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority) that democracies were emerging from the long slumber during which tech companies had prospered obscenely. The tech companies saw this coming, of course, and it was eerie to see how their responses echoed the playbooks of the tobacco and energy companies of an earlier period, as chronicled, for example, by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway in their 2010 book, Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming. The other day, Andrew Bosworth, the incoming chief technology officer of Meta (nee Facebook) was asked whether he thought “vaccine hesitancy would be the same with or without social media”. His reply, verbatim, reads: “I think Facebook ran probably the biggest Covid vaccine campaign in the world. What more can you do if some people who can get that real information from a real source choose not to get it? That’s their choice. They’re allowed to do that. You have an issue with those people. You don’t have an issue with Facebook. You can’t put that on me.”
Sounds familiar? It’s what oil companies came up with when they invented the idea of the “carbon footprint” – ie your footprint on the biosphere, not theirs. It’s the displacement of responsibility strategy: since it’s a free country, nobody’s forcing you to do the thing that’s bad for you. Childhood obesity is the responsibility of the child or of his or her parents. Alcoholism happens because you don’t “drink responsibly”. Radicalisation of the mass shooter is not YouTube’s responsibility. It’s always your fault, not that of the manufacturer of the addictive product. Next. Looking forward to 2022, what we can anticipate is a repeat performance of that perennial staple of capitalism: irrational exuberance – the phenomenon by which, in the words of the economist Robert Shiller, “news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person and, in the process, amplifies stories that might justify the price increase and brings in a larger and larger class of investors, who, despite doubts about the real value of the investment, are drawn to it partly through envy of others’ successes and partly through a gambler’s excitement”. This tulip-mania de nos jours has been happening with cryptocurrencies for a while, but is about to become more frenzied as the notion that blockchain – the cryptographic technology that underpins bitcoin, Ethereum et al – can become the basis for something called Web3: a new, properly decentralised version of the world wide web (as compared with the current version in which control has become effectively centralised in a small number of giant corporations).
In principle, this is an interesting idea – to create what in effect would be an alternative world of finance, commerce, communications and entertainment that could radically transform significant elements of the global economy – and not be controlled by banks and governments. But for those of us cursed with memories of the past, this has a feeling of deja vu. It reminds us of the early days of the internet in the 1980s, when it evoked utopian dreams; here at last, we believed, was an invention that had the potential to dissolve the sclerotic power structures of the old world and become a force for democratisation and human empowerment. It didn’t work out like that, of course. We underestimated the cunning and ruthlessness of corporations, the feebleness of governments and the fact that many of our fellow humans were content to be passive couch potatoes, albeit with streamed box sets. Faced with the dream of Web3, then, the obvious question is: will history repeat itself? Only time will tell. In the meantime, from this recovering utopian: happy new year!

The billionaire Patrick Drahi has been assiduously building his stake in the British telecoms giant, having spent more than £3bn to acquire 18% to date, making him BT’s biggest shareholder. After his latest purchase in December, Drahi is now barred under UK rules from mounting a full takeover bid until 15 June, although he can continue to strengthen his grip by snapping up more stock. Drahi, an activist investor known for deep cost-cutting at businesses he controls, will also use his time to allay political concerns about a potential foreign takeover of BT, a company considered critical to the national broadband and mobile infrastructure. The government has already fired a warning shot, saying that it will “not hesitate to act” to protect BT, and in January ministers will gain tougher powers to block takeovers of sensitive national assets under the new National Security and Investment Act 2021. Nevertheless, BT’s days of independence look numbered. Deutsche Telekom, the second-biggest shareholder in BT, with a 12.06% stake, has said it is “entertaining all options” regarding the British company’s future. It is considered a “kingmaker” in any play for BT: if Drahi were to buy its stake, he would hit the 30% threshold at which a takeover offer must be tabled. Mark Sweney ITM Power This year could offer a breakthrough for one of the UK’s leading green hydrogen companies as it moves to capitalise on a boom in demand for the clean-burning gas, with plans to expand internationally. ITM Power, a little-known Aim-listed company, has emerged as one to watch in the UK’s burgeoning green hydrogen industry. At its factory in Sheffield, it manufactures the electrolysers that turn renewable energy and water into a climate-friendly alternative to fossil gas.
The company, which in recent months won the chance to provide a 100-megawatt electrolyser for Shell’s Rhineland refinery in Germany, plans to open a second electrolyser plant in Sheffield and has confirmed that its first overseas plant will follow before 2024. The demand for green hydrogen is expected to boom over the coming decades as major economies begin to pursue climate targets in earnest. Green hydrogen can replace fossil gas in power plants, factories and even heavy-duty trucks and ships, and unlike the rival “blue hydrogen” it is not derived from fossil fuels and its production does not cause carbon emissions. ITM Power will fuel its growth with the £250m it successfully raised last month. Its end-of-year trading update shows its backlog of orders for electrolysers has climbed by more than 60% since September to the equivalent of 499 megawatts, while its pipeline of tenders stands at just over 900MW. Jillian Ambrose Revolut The banking and payments app, once known for its popularity among “finance bros”, is finally making headlines for more than just controversial working conditions and its founder’s alleged connections to the Kremlin. Over the past year, Revolut has solidified its presence overseas – with its services now available in more than 35 countries – applied for US and UK banking licences, and become one of the UK’s most valuable fintech startups, worth about £24bn after funding from major global investors including Japan’s Softbank. That is indicative of the company’s insatiable appetite for growth, with its founder – Russian-born former Lehman Brothers trader Nik Storonsky – declaring that he intends to make it the largest bank in Britain. Since launching in the UK six years ago, Revolut has gone from offering a pre-paid card focused on currency exchange to a multi-service app offering business accounts, children’s cashcards, investments, wage advances and cryptocurrency trading. It has also been stacking its boardroom with people from Goldman Sachs and HSBC, and appointed ex-Standard Life Aberdeen boss Martin Gilbert as its chair. The move helped to restore and solidify its reputation, after it faced bad press in 2019 for allegedly overworking staff. Storonsky has admitted the company has made some mistakes but is setting his sights higher. If 2021 is any indication, Revolut will continue to hit milestones in 2022, assuming it does not spread itself too thin. Kalyeena Makortoff Vertical Aerospace
The Bristol-based flying taxi pioneer listed on the New York Stock Exchange just before Christmas via a Spac (special purpose acquisition company), apparently confirming its entry into the big league. However, investors are currently debating whether flying taxis – or electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), as they like to be formally known – will prove to be Teslas or tulips. Shares leapt and then slipped quickly back 30% in the first week – labouring for takeoff, much like the embryonic eVTOLs so far seen in public. That said, Vertical Aerospace boasts a provisional £5.5bn order book from the likes of American Airlines and Virgin, and partners including Rolls-Royce, Microsoft and Honeywell. It also aims to climb above the competition by keeping a pilot on board its vehicles, which could speed up regulatory approval. Ultimately, it claims, its VX4 aircraft will be able to fly four passengers at 200mph for costs that are “comparable to a taxi”. Just don’t mention helicopters … (eVTOLs, it is promised, will be incomparably safer, quieter and greener). Gwyn Topham Arrival Following a similar path to Vertical, Arrival listed in New York in March via a Spac merger. The company, which plans to make electric vans, taxis and buses, saw its market value soar as high as $13bn (£9.7bn) after it listed, amid electric-vehicle market mania, but it is now back at $5.1bn as investors await its first revenues. This year will bring the first true test of its abilities. Based in the UK, with its first factory near Bicester, Oxfordshire, Arrival claims its vehicles are already as cheap as fossil fuel equivalents, and cost much less to run. Bus tests started in December, and production begins in the spring. Van production will start in the summer, followed by cars designed in partnership with Uber in 2023. Yet perhaps the most eyecatching aspect of Arrival’s ascent is something that buyers will probably never see: founder Denis Sverdlov, a Russian telecoms billionaire, has set out to upend the logic of high-volume automotive manufacturing. Instead of the long assembly lines pioneered by Henry Ford, Arrival uses robots to build vehicles in a single small “cell”. That could mean lower set-up costs – and a whole new model of putting factories next to their biggest markets. Jasper Jolly Marks & Spencer The high street stalwart seems to have had more turnaround plans during its 137-year history than it has sold hot ready-meal dinners, but its latest, post-pandemic revamp appeared to finally bear fruit last year. M&S now needs to capitalise on the improvement in fortunes of its once-struggling clothing and homeware division. The retailer dared to dream these sales had turned a corner over the past year; in 2022 it will need to prove to investors that this recovery isn’t temporary. While the chain is clinging to its position as the UK’s largest clothing retailer, analysts are asking whether recent fashion acquisitions including heritage name Jaeger, and a stake in sustainable brand Nobody’s Child, can keep pushing apparel sales upwards. A tie-up with delivery firm Ocado got off to a good start, and food sales look encouraging. The question now is whether M&S will increase its stake in the joint venture. The shares are still languishing at around a third below their value when chief executive Steve Rowe took over in 2016. There is speculation he will step down in the next 18 months, and he will surely want to leave on a high. Despite a couple of profit upgrades, M&S still has some way to go before it can reclaim the place in the FTSE 100 it lost in 2019. Joanna Partridge
Scancell This spinout from the University of Nottingham, founded in 1997 by Lindy Durrant, professor of cancer immunotherapy at the university, specialises in developing cancer vaccines and has started testing them on humans. But when the pandemic struck, the company decided to modify its vaccine technology to develop Covid shots, in collaboration with Nottingham’s two universities and backed by £2m funding from the UK’s innovation agency. The vaccines aim to induce high T-cell immune responses in the body to identify and kill infected cells, as well as generating virus-neutralising antibodies. Scientists say a strong T-cell response would offer longer-lasting immunity, because the protection from antibodies wanes more quickly, as the current Covid jabs show. As many people are afraid of needles, Scancell decided its vaccines would be administered via spring-powered injectors that use a narrow stream of fluid to pierce the skin. The first trials with 40 healthy volunteers started in South Africa in October, and a further trial is planned in the UK, and data from the studies is expected by June. The company’s two main shareholders are the US health investor Redmile and the Singaporean Vulpes Life Science Fund, while Durrant and other management own 1.8% of the company. Its shares have rocketed in the past two years, from nearly 7p in early January 2020 to over 20p, but remain far below their closing high of nearly 57p, reached in October 2012.

6087;6087;Lost shots of 90s rave culture by Terence Donovan to go on show;2022-01-01T16:00:06Z;['Donna Ferguson'];['Terence Donovan', 'UK news', 'Art and design', 'Birmingham', 'Culture', 'Photography', 'Fashion', 'Life and style', 'Music', 'Exhibitions'];"Newly discovered photographs of 1990s rave culture taken by the fashion photographer Terence Donovan shortly before he died are to go on public display for the first time. The intimate shots of revellers lost in the sounds of the Que Club in Birmingham, a music venue graced by everyone from David Bowie and Blur to Daft Punk and Run-DMC, are thought to be some of the last photographs Donovan took. Hidden in a drawer in Wolverhampton for 25 years, the images mark a “very unusual” shift in subject matter for the photographer, who made his name in the 1960s capturing “swinging London” and supermodels such as Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton. “At the time he took these photos, he was still a photographer for Vogue doing fashion shoots and taking photos of rich and famous people,” said Jez Collins, curator of the forthcoming exhibit, The Que, which will show 10 of the 65 newly discovered photos at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in April. “He would photograph people like Princess Diana and musicians like Jimi Hendrix and Ian Dury – but to my knowledge, he had never photographed a club environment and ordinary, everyday people.” Donovan was approaching 60 when, in January 1996, he focused his lens on the dance and rave culture of the Que Club at the request of his son, a student at Birmingham University who DJ’d there. “He would have been completely out of his comfort zone in terms of the music, which had a pounding beat, with a lot of drugs being taken in the dark,” said Collins. “I think the subject matter and the building itself intrigued him.” The Que Club was located in a former church, the cavernous Grade II-listed Methodist Central Hall, and Donovan visited on a techno music night known as House of God. Shooting in black and white, on a smoky dancefloor, “he captured something of great beauty. The photographs are really evocative of what clubbing culture was like then.” As well as revealing the range of subcultures in the club – punks with mohicans, bare-chested skinheads, girls in tight dresses and youths in tracksuit tops, “these photographs show the intimacy of the dancefloor, the unbridled expression of people having a good time, of dancing together in a close space”.
They seem particularly poignant at this time. “I think people will look at this, when the exhibition is on, and just have that moment of thinking of things that maybe we have lost because of Covid,” said Collins. “That intimacy, that closeness, that experience of being very close to people you don’t know and sharing in that same moment the same music – and dancing together. That sense of being part of something bigger than yourself.” Donovan’s photos highlight a culturally important moment in the history of Birmingham’s music and clubbing scene, he said. “It’s an amazing find after all these years. This was an important place for people, and it’s been captured by one of the greatest British photographers of the time.” In November 1996, Donovan took his own life. At the inquest, it emerged he had been suffering from severe depression, linked to a steroid treatment prescribed for his eczema. By then, his son had sent the pictures to Chris Wishart, a founder of the House of God club night. They lay in the drawer at Wishart’s house until Collins, founder of the Birmingham Music Archive, which documents and celebrates the city’s musical heritage, turned up last year to interview Wishart for a film about the Que Club. “I interviewed him for an hour and a half and he didn’t mention Terence coming to the club or the photographs. But as we were walking out the door, he said ‘Jez, I think you might be interested in this.’ And I opened this drawer, and there was this box of Terence Donovan photographs. They were just stunning.” He could hardly believe his eyes: “I actually took a photograph of the drawer.”";https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/01/lost-shots-90s-rave-culture-terence-donovan-go-on-show-birmingham-swinging-london
6088;6088;Juliet Davenport: Good Energy founder spreads her wings and her expertise;2022-01-01T16:00:06Z;['Jillian Ambrose'];['Energy industry', 'Green economy', 'Renewable energy', 'Business', 'Energy'];"Juliet Davenport may have made a lucky escape from the energy supply market. The founder and former chief executive of green power supplier Good Energy ended her 20-year tenure last February, months before an unprecedented surge in global energy prices left the industry reeling. But then, it’s not unusual for Davenport to be ahead of the curve. Set up in the late 1990s, Good Energy was one of the first “challenger” suppliers to compete with the behemoths of British Gas and others, which had been created by privatisation. It was also a pioneering investor in renewable power, and an early champion of small-scale community energy ventures. “I think you can become a bit of an institution if you’re not careful,” she laughs. In the bar of an upmarket central London hotel, Davenport is taking a break from the schedule of meetings she has to attend as one of the energy industry’s busiest non-executive directors. Few such boardroom figures have a pedigree quite as green as Davenport’s. She founded Good Energy, the UK’s first supplier of 100% renewable power, in 1999, and the company has boasted ownership of the UK’s first commercial onshore windfarm since 2002. She is married to Mark Shorrock, the entrepreneur behind the controversial Swansea Tidal Lagoon, * * * CV Age 53 Family one daughter, one stepdaughter. Education MA Physics, Oxford University, MSc Economics, Birkbeck. Last holiday Cornwall, to Delabole, site of the UK’s first windfarm. Best advice she’s been given “Try to work with people you like on things that interest you.” Biggest career mistake “Hiring people just on their credentials.” Word she overuses “Cool.” How she relaxes “Riding and reading – I’m still working on doing them simultaneously.” * * * and has weathered a long-term public squabble with fellow energy maverick Dale Vince, including an attempted boardroom coup by his company, Ecotricity, earlier this year. Having stepped back from the day-to-day running of Good Energy, Davenport sits on the boards of a string of companies that are helping tackle the climate crisis. Perhaps her most notable role is as chair of rooftop solar innovator Atrato Onsite Energy, whose flotation in November made it the first company with an all-female board to list on the London Stock Exchange. Davenport says she was no longer content with “turning up and doing the same thing” when she realised that, after decades of hard-learned lessons in the industry, she could spread her wings and help new energy firms navigate the market. Good Energy was in need of some new skills too – notably in digital innovation. Proving that sometimes being ahead of the curve means recognising when others are further ahead, Davenport said she wanted to bring in “someone who was better at digital than I could ever be”. She remains a director of the London-listed company, which she says is in a good position to weather an energy crisis in which dozens of small suppliers have gone bust. The company has always hedged its exposure to global commodity prices by buying plenty of energy in advance, she says, and has negotiated supply deals directly with local renewable energy projects, which also helps to establish a fixed price. At the root of the industry’s crisis, she adds, are small energy companies which have failed to maintain the support of investors by differentiating themselves in a busy market, along with a string of problems with how that market is regulated. So is the growing criticism of the industry watchdog, Ofgem, justified? Absolutely, comes the matter-of-fact response.
“We’ve been having conversations with the regulator around various areas related to competition in the market for probably the past six or seven years,” she says. “The biggest issue was that [Ofgem’s] key performance indicator for success was the number of suppliers in the market, and the amount of switching between suppliers. That has always been a problem.” The clarion call for households to help address sluggish competition in the energy market by shopping around for the cheapest deal unleashed a flood of poorly financed suppliers and unsustainably low energy deals. This race to the bottom has left more than 4 million households in need of a new energy supplier after record prices caused 26 companies to collapse. “The UK needs energy companies which are prepared to invest in the future,” Davenport says. “If you’re constantly competing on price alone, you can’t invest.” As chair of Atrato, Davenport has her mind on investment: it’s just weeks since the rooftop solar venture raised £150m in an oversubscribed market listing. The company plans to use rooftop solar installations to unlock the largely untapped potential of commercial properties. Its strength lies in bringing together staff who have “a significant understanding of the commercial property market” with experts in renewable energy development. In time, Atrato expects to create standardised contracts that can make the still-niche decision to fit a leased office block with solar capability a “plug and play” option. “The original Good Energy headquarters was owned by a pension fund,” she says. “I remember trying at least once a year to put solar on the roof and completely failing, because the [owners] were so far removed and just didn’t want any complications. “Now a lot of corporates have a commitment to using renewables, and installing projects on their own site is part of fulfilling that. Helping them navigate the way forward if they don’t own their building is a huge part of that. The energy market has to be about making things easy for consumers.” The Atrato ethos echoes in some ways that of Good Energy, which for decades made it easy for households to play a role in the growth of renewables by choosing a tariff from a company that invests directly in renewable energy projects. “The question is how fast we can do it,” she says. “And how standardised we can make this process. If we keep everything as simple and repetitive as possible, we can move faster.” Energy companies that can “enable” consumers to decarbonise their energy use because it’s the easier option are the ones to watch, Davenport believes. “For many years I saw big companies and government try to do big projects because that’s what they can control. But so much can be done on a decentralised level if you can get inside the head of a consumer,” she says. In her next chapter Davenport plans to do just that, all over again.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/01/juliet-davenport-good-energy-founder-spreads-wings-and-expertise
6089;6089;London teacher wins praise for children’s book about pandemic;2022-01-01T15:33:07Z;['Jedidajah Otte'];['Books', 'Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'London', 'Sadiq Khan', 'Children', 'Mental health'];"The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has congratulated a primary school teacher who wrote a children’s book aimed at gently tackling Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy in the black and minority ethnic community and promoting children’s mental health. Banji Alexander, who teaches at a school in south-east London with a large number of students and staff from minority ethnic backgrounds, started writing Lockdown Looms: Reggie’s Birthday Party, a book detailing a child’s experience of the pandemic, during the second lockdown. “I put pen to paper just after Christmas 2020, and wrote the book in between teaching my year 3 class remotely online after the government’s decision to close schools,” Alexander said. “I needed a book that I could use to allay the fears of my learners surrounding the pandemic. The world as we knew it was changing rapidly around us and children, parents and teachers alike found it challenging.”
The story covers topics such as masks, social distancing, home schooling, vaccinations, bereavements, chaotic supermarket scenes and food shortages. “I remember children in my class being disappointed about not being able to celebrate their birthdays in the ‘normal’ way, and missing members of their families, who they weren’t able to see due to the restrictions,” Alexander, who lost his uncle during the pandemic, said. Reggie, the seven-year-old protagonist, is fed up with home schooling and online learning at the end of a lockdown and looking forward to celebrating his eighth birthday with family and friends as new restrictions loom. The aim was to write a book that would offer hope and benefit children’s mental health, said the author, who said he discussed the characters’ feelings with his pupils, teaching them vocabulary to express their own emotions with more accuracy. “The important messages in the book are about kindness, resilience, patience, gratitude and adapting to change. I want the reader to know there is light at the end of the tunnel, regardless of how challenging things may seem. I hope the book will help children learn how to manage their expectations, and become better at articulating how they are feeling.” The book also touches on fears surrounding the Covid vaccine. “I am aware that vaccination uptake is considerably lower in some demographics within the BAME community,” Alexander said. “The topic of vaccinations is quite a divisive one, and for young children, seeing their adults feel quite strongly about a topic can be alarming and confusing, particularly if their friend or friend’s family believe the opposite. “As an educator, it’s my job to dispel myths – be that just by gently mentioning the vaccinations, which play an integral part in the lockdown eventually coming to an end in my story.” Sadiq Khan wrote to Alexander to thank him for his efforts in supporting his pupils during the pandemic. “Teachers like yourself have gone above and beyond to show care and commitment to your students. Your support has been so vital to ensuring students are not only educated, but given the tools to develop resilience, as we continue to adjust to extraordinary times,” the mayor wrote.";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/01/london-teacher-wins-praise-for-childrens-book-about-pandemic
6090;6090;Frozen in time: clock that tells tale of Jewish resistance in wartime Amsterdam;2022-01-01T15:25:34Z;['Jennifer Rankin'];['Holocaust', 'Second world war', 'World news', 'Netherlands', 'Europe', 'History', 'Anne Frank', 'Museums', 'Judaism', 'Culture'];"A clock that is the sole surviving object from a second world war Jewish hideout will go on display at Amsterdam’s Dutch Resistance Museum this year. The round mantelpiece clock may have been one of the last things people saw as they were seized by the Nazis and sent to death camps. Along with scores of family photographs, documents and a book of poetry, the clock belonged to the family of Janny Brandes-Brilleslijper, a Holocaust survivor and resistance fighter. The family artefacts help tell the story of Dutch Jewish resistance to the Nazis, so often overshadowed by the horrific history of the large numbers sent to their death. About three-quarters of Dutch Jews were murdered during the second world war, the highest death rate in western Europe. “That is a factor why people thought that the Jewish resistance was next to non-existent,” said Filip Bloem, collection manager at the museum. “But if you look more precisely you see there were many Jews, thousands and thousands of Jews, in hiding.” After the Nazis invaded, Marianne Brandes-Brilleslijper, known to everyone as Janny, refused to get a Jewish ID card and started working for the resistance, stencilling messages on pillars and posts, moving illegal parcels and documents, often hidden under the mattress of her pram carrying one of her children. When the net began to tighten, she and her husband Bob, and their two children, Robbie and Liselotte, moved to a villa in the woods outside Amsterdam.
She lived there with her parents, her sister Lien’s family, other Jewish people and resistance fighters. At its peak, 17 permanent residents lived at ’t Hooge Nest (the High Nest), a tale recounted by Roxane van Iperen in her bestselling book of the same name, published in English as The Sisters of Auschwitz. Hidden away from the main road, the villa became an unlikely haven for culture, as the residents put on concerts, wrote music and distributed resistance papers. “Yiddish culture and other arts flourish at the High Nest. There is dance, music, song and recitation. Simon drums, Puck plays the violin and Jaap builds Kathinka a little piano,” wrote van Iperen. It did not last. The group was betrayed in the summer of 1944. Janny had been out shopping when the Nazis arrived. Laden with heavy bags of wheat, she asked four-year-old Robbie to run ahead for help with the shopping. It was only when she got to the door that she saw the big Chinese vase in the window was gone – the warning signal. “She knew it was wrong, but I was already running into the house,” said Robert Brandes, now 82, recounting one of his few memories of life in the High Nest. “She couldn’t call me back and I was already in the house and she knew it was lost. They hit my mother. I can still remember.” Janny, her family and the other Jewish occupants were sent to the Dutch transit camp of Westerbork. (Robbie and Liselotte were spared as Janny’s husband was not Jewish). At Westerbork, they met another Amsterdam family who had been discovered, after two years hiding in the secret annexe: Anne Frank, her sister Margot and their parents. The Brilleslijpers and the Franks were put on the last transport to leave the Netherlands for Auschwitz. As the war entered its final stages, Janny, Lien and the Frank sisters were sent by train, then forced on a death march to Bergen-Belsen. At this overcrowded, disease-ridden camp – “a runaway fair of insane, sick and dying people” wrote van Iperen – Janny worked as a nurse, although there were no medicines. She urged friends, family acquaintances to live, pre-chewing stale bread for the weakest, scavenging tiny scraps of food, closing eyes. She was one of the last to see the Frank sisters alive.
Janny and Lien survived the war. Robert remembers the day his mother came to the family’s rented house on the Amstel in Amsterdam. “I cried out to the whole street, look ‘My mother is back, come see everyone my mother is back.’” One of the exhibits donated to the museum is a letter from Robert’s father to Janny, telling of his joy that she survived. “Darling, I thought I would sink through the floor for joy. I just didn’t know what to say or to do. Robby is still the sweet boy you knew. Our darling Liselotte resembles my sweet wife more and more.” Janny’s father’s identity card, with a large J stamped on it, is also on display. Joseph Brilleslijper, his wife Fietje and their son Jaap, died at Auschwitz. Janny devoted her life to the recognition of war victims. She died in 2003. The collection also includes a poetry album belonging to Lien Brilleslijper, a booklet where family and friends would write life lessons in verse. “When you read it now with the knowledge that many of them didn’t survive the war, that is bittersweet,” Bloem said. The documents and photos will be available on digital display on the museum’s website in the spring, while the clock is due to join the permanent collection from October.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/clock-jewish-resistance-wartime-amsterdam-auschwitz-anne-frank-netherlands-death-camp
6091;6091;The person who got me through 2021: Miss J and America’s Next Top Model transported me to carefree times;2022-01-01T15:00:06Z;['Juno Dawson'];['Life and style', 'Television', 'LGBTQ+ rights', 'Television & radio'];"It sounds troublingly shallow, but when I saw the tweet that said “Holy shit, ANTM [America’s Next Top Model] is on Amazon Prime” my heart soared. I am not one who can pretend the pandemic isn’t still raging but, in that fleeting moment, I felt a spiritual lightness I hadn’t experienced since 2019. I dropped everything to binge the episodes, then fell deep into a rabbit hole of detective work: where are the contestants now? Are they on Instagram? I found a whole subsection of TikTok dedicated to calling out where the show was problematic, and YouTuber Oliver Twixt has a highly viewed series of interviews with ANTM contestants levelling accusations of maltreatment at the show’s producers. Whatever the reason, ANTM is back in the cultural sphere. For the uninitiated, ANTM premiered in 2003 and continued for 24 series or “cycles”, until its last gasp in 2018. Each season, young wannabe models competed for a modelling contract. They were mentored by supermodel Tyra Banks and her fellow judges, including runway coach Miss J Alexander who participated in 18 cycles. Way back in 2003, we weren’t where we are now in terms of trans or non-binary representation. Cycle 1 contestant Robin Manning christened Alexander “Miss J” to differentiate them from creative director “Mr” Jay Manuel. As we’re now in 2021, I ask Miss J to clarify the pronoun situation. “Miss J answers to all and any pronouns ... Just respect me – call me what you want – but don’t forget to sign that cheque.” There’s something pleasingly quaint about the fact Miss J flip-flopped his pronouns and gender expression – often wearing self-made dresses on the judging panel – without having to label himself as trans, non-binary or a drag queen. Nowadays he would be asked to define himself; here I am, literally doing just that. Miss J appeared in hundreds of episodes, so it’s not surprising that his decade on the show is something of a blur to him. “I look back on that time as me, doing me, being me,” he says. “Feeling fierce and fabulous. Being creative. I created my wardrobe.” But not all the memories are good ones. “I think about the girls, what they went through and how they were treated. I look at the backlash and I do wonder if we knew what we were putting them through.” Indeed. Some moments have aged terribly. Yes, I’m thinking of the two occasions when white models donned blackface for photoshoots. The show is also guilty of cultural insensitivity - visits to overseas destinations were treated as an excuse to caricature indigenous peoples – and pressuring contestants to lose weight. Miss J is philosophical: “I can’t speak on the photoshoots because I wasn’t on [them].” I suggest it’s slightly unfair to judge TV from 15 years ago by today’s more enlightened standards. Miss J agrees. “Did we mean harm? No. I didn’t understand it, why [the blackface] photoshoot happened. Was the idea to make them feel what it’s liked to be mixed? I would have asked them what the takeaway was. But it wouldn’t fly right now.” Some of the former contestants have been less than complimentary about the show, since it re-entered the spotlight. “Some of the girls got upset because they didn’t make it,” says Miss J. “They were competing with other girls and only one girl can win. So now they feel they didn’t get the support they needed. But these girls watched the show. They knew the formula.” And there definitely was a formula. Audiences came to recognise that if a contestant spoke about her home life, it was almost certainly because she was returning to it by the conclusion of that episode. You could also set your watch by the moment when a pretty prom queen-type entered the salon for “makeover week”. Nothing beats the feeling when the stylist takes that Rapunzel-length ponytail in hand and cruelly snips it off while the poor model wails. TV gold. “It was as good for me as it was for you!” Miss J laughs. I’m always surprised that the contestants were surprised. Surely they’d seen the show before? “They knew what they were getting into. They knew we were gonna chop that shit off! Why talk shit about it online?” A few contestants went on to greatness: Winnie Harlow and Leila Goldkuhl notably escaped the “curse” of Top Model, and worked with Calvin Klein and Chanel among others. But most (including a smattering of male models) returned to small-town obscurity. For some, their post-show destiny involved prison (Renee Alway) or addiction (Jael Strauss); one former contestant was murdered (Mirjana Puhar). Even with the criticisms of exploitation directed at talent shows, Miss J thinks there’s still life in the old format. “The fashion world has changed,” he says. “Plus-size models on the catwalk; dark-skinned models are totally taking over. Black Lives Matter has meant everyone wants a Black girl in their campaign. There’s a lot of trans models – and no-one knows. Some are out, some aren’t.” In fairness to ANTM, they were ahead of the curve there. Trans model and actor Isis King competed on the show in 2008, one of the first prominent trans women of colour to break through into the mainstream. But post #MeToo, and with a far greater awareness of the exploitation of young models, is it OK to portray the world of fashion as even dimly aspirational? Would it be safe even? “It can be, because right now everything is microscopically watched,” says Miss J. “We need to change our tone and language. It needs to be a safe space for all of us.” Despite everything, I really, really hope they bring it back. I want more. I’m sorry, I can’t help it; I do. I wonder if, when we dig out the comfort blankets of our past, it’s a subconscious desire to flee back. I watched ANTM in my early 20s when I was truly free for the first time in my life.

6092;6092;On my radar: Moses Sumney’s cultural highlights;2022-01-01T15:00:06Z;['Kathryn Bromwich'];['Moses Sumney', 'Culture', 'Television', 'Pop and rock', 'Music', 'Books', 'Fashion', 'Television & radio', 'Life and style'];"Singer-songwriter Moses Sumney, 29, grew up between Ghana and California and studied creative writing and poetry at UCLA. His piercing falsetto and genre-defying music have brought him critical acclaim, starting with his self-recorded 2014 EP Mid-City Island, followed in 2017 by his debut album, Aromanticism, and the 2020 double album Græ. Sumney has collaborated with musicians including Bon Iver and James Blake and toured with Solange and Sufjan Stevens. His latest project is Blackalachia, a self-directed concert film created in association with WePresent, shot over two days in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina, where he lives. 1. TV Selling Sunset (Netflix)
I pity anyone who hasn’t seen this show. It’s a reality show about a real estate agency in west Hollywood, and it follows the lives and deals of the people who work there, predominantly the female staff who are all ridiculously Barbie-ish – essentially “career Barbie on crack”. It’s incredible. I love reality TV – it tells us a lot about humanity. Reality shows are always inherently dated, so they’re a great capsule of the modern era. 2. Music Don’t Be So Hard On Your Own Beauty by Yeule
I don’t know what it is about this song, but I’m addicted to it. Yeule is a Singaporean artist based in London who’s kind of new on the scene, and this song is just so hypnotising – it hints and winks at hyperpop while being an absolutely heart-shattering folk tune. It’s a beautiful amalgamation of a lot of different genres, and it’s stunning. I have a lot of playlists – for driving, for chilling at night, a morning playlist, a folk playlist – and this is in all of them.
3. Book How to Do Nothing by Jenny Odell I’m currently reading this – I put off reading it because it looks like a self-help book – but it’s really fascinating. The author is an artist who works largely in digital art and the book is about how to free yourself from the capitalist trappings of the workforce – not necessarily saying “quit your job”, but suggesting a new path for work. It asks the question: how can we construct our identities apart from defining ourselves by what we do and by our income? It’s a very radical book, and it’s often a hard read. But it has been mind-shifting. 4. Place Western North Carolina
I’ve been travelling a lot for work, so I’ve been thinking about how much I would prefer to spend my time in western North Carolina, particularly in the mountains, where I live. I think it’s the most beautiful place in the world. I first arrived in Asheville when I was on tour and knew immediately I wanted to live here. You turn around, 360 degrees in any direction, and you’re surrounded by trees, by the sound of animals, and that’s really a rare feeling for anyone who’s spent most of their life, as I have, living in the city. 5. Film Eve’s Bayou (Kasi Lemmons, 1997)
This stars a young Jurnee Smollett, who recently had a resurgence with Lovecraft Country. She’s 10 years old in the film, which is set in a fictional small town in Louisiana. Samuel L Jackson stars as the patriarch of the family, who is maybe cheating on his wife, his daughter sets out to kill him and punish him, perhaps through witchcraft. It was incredibly critically acclaimed and subsequently snubbed by every major award ceremony. It’s a gorgeous, heartbreaking film. I first saw it last year and I think about it every day. 6. Fashion Balenciaga
The couture line that Balenciaga launched this summer is another thing that has permanent residency in my brain. I think that what Demna [Gvasalia, creative director] is doing with sculpture and architecture through fashion is some of the most interesting theatre of our time. It’s like a marriage of Romantic and gothic style – it’s a bit ecclesiastical, almost monastic, and I want it all. There’s this really wonderful circular headpiece that feels like: “I’m going to service, but in the year 3021.”";https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/01/on-my-radar-moses-sumneys-cultural-highlights

But while Durkin’s picture was strikingly cinematic in its approach, The Humans struggles to escape its theatrical origins – the film is adapted from Karam’s own Tony award-winning stage play.
It’s not the most visually arresting work, but the sound design team excel – the prewar apartment in lower Manhattan creaks and groans its displeasure during a dysfunctional family Thanksgiving. The casting is also first-rate, with Richard Jenkins and a wounded, garrulous Jayne Houdyshell the standouts.

6094;6094;Jamie Dornan’s right, comfort TV is causing our attention spans to desert us | Rebecca Nicholson;2022-01-01T15:00:05Z;['Rebecca Nicholson'];['Jamie Dornan', 'Culture', 'Succession', 'Television', 'Downton Abbey', 'Television & radio', 'Netflix'];"I like to imagine Jamie Dornan – you might anticipate a full stop there, but do carry on – having the same issues as the rest of us over Christmas, craving a second to switch off and so switching the television on. Perhaps he, too, spent time staring at a hectic page on a streaming service, wondering for so long what to watch that scrolling became the activity and then it was time for bed, the evening having been filled by an endless click of the down button, interrupted only by arguments about whether The Wolf of Wall Street or Zero Dark Thirty is more festive or should we do a Girls5eva or three instead? (The answer is always yes.) In an interview with the Radio Times, Dornan pointed out that viewers are “spoilt for choice” these days and that it is always easy to give up on a new series quickly and move on to the next. “Which I think is a bit dangerous,” he said, arguing that it is often worth giving something a chance or more than one episode. It brought to mind Succession, of course it did, which, in its first season, was far from the ubiquitous must-see it has become. I’d heard it was “slow”, put it off, until I didn’t. The BBC’s new adaptation of Around the World in 80 Days is a certifiable slow starter, but it gets better and I hope viewers offer it their patience. They are under no obligation to, of course. There is an avalanche of choice, though that in itself can be overwhelming, which, granted, is a wild indulgence to grumble about. It is the “my diamond shoes are too tight” of complaints, to borrow a line from Friends, which has inflated its own popularity using the air pump of streaming and remains as popular as it was when it first appeared, if not far more so. Which makes me wonder if the sheer amount of shows we have to choose from drives many viewers back to old familiars or comfort viewing. Certainly, it seems that older shows remain popular. Netflix reports that The Salisbury Poisonings, Downton Abbey and Ackley Bridge have been among its most viewed series in recent weeks, though it’s impossible to know if viewers are rewatching or discovering for the first time. Is it the fact that they are inherently known, already tested on audiences, which makes them an easier choice? It’s hard to tell. But Dornan is right: our already-stretched attention spans are getting shorter and shorter. If we demand instant gratification from television, it will lead to television that is eager to please and that is rarely a good thing. Abba: vinyl is on a voyage, but not for new artists
The great vinyl revival shows no sign of stopping. The British Phonographic Industry has estimated that more than 5m vinyl albums were bought in the UK in 2021, accounting for almost one in four album purchases, the highest proportion since 1990. Abba’s Voyage is on track to be the bestselling vinyl of the year, followed by Adele, Fleetwood Mac, Ed Sheeran and Amy Winehouse. It’s a funny old list, a hodgepodge of huge stars, suggesting the decline of that image of the crate-digger sifting through rare cuts in a dusty old shop, affirming that the popularity of vinyl is built on pop. It also points to the collapse of distinct musical eras. Over Christmas, I watched my young niece and nephew dancing to their favourite songs, loaded up on YouTube, one after the other, and it was an odyssey through the decades that reached a climax with Shakira’s 2010 World Cup anthem Waka Waka. It was a concoction of everything from pop’s beginnings to its present and was not particularly shaped by the time in which they live. For smaller and newer artists, though, who are far more reliant on the income from record sales in order to have a hope of surviving, getting vinyl produced last year was difficult, if not impossible, owing to a lack of infrastructure, supply chain issues and the sheer dominance of the big guns at the top, who have gobbled up production capacity. A new plant, Press On Vinyl, is about to open in Middlesbrough and one can only hope the appetite for vinyl leads to more places that are capable of making it. Sally Rooney: a panel of 4.7million is a prize indeed
I have an awful habit of lurking on the internet, rather than getting involved in it. I do it on Reddit to the extent that I had to delete the app, because it was filling all the time I’d saved by deleting the Facebook app and then Twitter. But my favourite place to lurk is Goodreads, where readers leave sometimes devastatingly honest, incredibly well-considered reviews of books they have read. Its users have just voted for their favourite books of 2021, giving Sally Rooney’s novel Beautiful World, Where Are You the best fiction prize. Its novelist character Alice would, I’m sure, accept the award, but feel terribly bad about it. Forget all those literary panels of six, with a prize winner here and an academic there. This is the real deal, a voting panel consisting of more than 4.7 million readers who truly know their stuff. Whenever I have finished a novel (never before, it’s full of spoilers), I check in with Goodreads to see how much people liked it, or not, and I always feel a little crushed if something I adored gets pummelled.

6095;6095;New Year’s Eve revellers in England take to streets despite Omicron concerns;2022-01-01T14:58:50Z;['Robyn Vinter'];['UK news', 'England', 'Coronavirus'];England’s New Year’s Eve celebrations on Friday were not quite the damp squib many were expecting, with partygoers taking to city centres across the country to celebrate the end of 2021. In Leeds, queues of revellers lined the streets, in stark contrast to the Christmas period, when the city centre had been virtually empty because of concerns over the highly infectious Omicron variant. On Greek Street, a tartan-clad bagpiper hired by a restaurant played Auld Lang Syne as groups of people of all ages went from bar to bar. Sophie Kramer and David Brown had come from Bradford for a New Year’s Eve night out with some friends. Being young and double-jabbed, they felt there was little risk for them. “I’m not worried, not at all,” said 24-year-old Kramer. “We’ve both had Covid before and we just really need a night out, to be honest. I know that sounds stupid because it’s a pandemic, but everyone’s mental health has been so bad this year. That’s important too. It’s not just about Covid.” Brown agreed. He said the couple had wanted to avoid self-isolation over Christmas but were less concerned about needing to isolate now. He said: “We were a bit more careful before but the Omicron variant isn’t supposed to be as bad, so I think it’s worth the risk.” Robert and Sheila Brine had a similar attitude. They had been for dinner and were heading to the casino before going home before midnight. “We’re not worried. We’ve got our masks, we’re triple-jabbed we’ve just got to get on with it,” Robert said. Ryan and Keely O’Shea were also going for dinner, in a change to their original plans. “We were supposed to be having a bit of a do but we’ve cancelled it because a lot of our friends didn’t want to be in a confined space with other people, which is understandable,” said Ryan. “I don’t know anyone who hasn’t been jabbed. I didn’t get it right away because I wanted to see what happened but I’m glad I’ve got it now. It gives you some confidence to go out and live a normal life.” His hesitancy was due to having very little trust in the Conservatives, he said. “I have trouble believing the government. But I always did. Now at least I think other people feel the same.” The pair said the UK government was being shown up by the devolved countries, which were handling the pandemic better. “I don’t understand why there are no rules in England but other places have got them,” Ryan added. Nightclubs in Wales were closed and indoor events were restricted to 50 people, leaving streets empty. Meanwhile in Scotland, despite the cancellation of large-scale Hogmanay events and being urged by the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, to “stay at home as much as possible”, about 1,000 people of all ages climbed to the top of Calton Hill in Edinburgh to make the traditional countdown to the bells at midnight. Sturgeon said the restrictions were aimed at cutting down transmission of the Omicron variant and because “large events put an additional burden on emergency services”.;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/01/new-years-eve-revellers-england-omicron-concerns
6096;6096;What are the current rules on self-isolation for Covid in UK, and what does the science say?;2022-01-01T14:55:05Z;['Robin McKie'];['Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'Infectious diseases', 'Microbiology', 'Medical research', 'Science', 'World news', 'Life and style'];"Doctors and health officials have warned that the rising number of Covid-19 infections poses a significant threat to the UK’s ability to run trains, buses, hospitals and other key services. More and more people face going into quarantine and that could have grave consequences, they say. As a result, isolation times for those testing positive for Sars-CoV-2 have been cut from 10 to seven days to reduce the pressure on industry. But is this reduction justified? Or is there room for even further quarantine cuts to be made, as has been done in the US? These are critical questions, the answers to which could determine how quickly the nation emerges from the wave of Covid-19 cases it is now experiencing. What are the rules for self-isolating after a positive Covid-19 result? In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, if you’ve tested positive or have symptoms, you can now stop self-isolating after seven days, instead of 10, if you get two negative lateral flow test results on days six and seven. In Scotland, the 10-day limit is still in force. What evidence is there that this reduced period of self-isolation is sufficient to halt people infecting others? “We know that people who get Covid-19 are most infectious early on around symptom onset, and that the risk of transmission declines pretty quickly after that,” says epidemiologist Billy Quilty, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “By the time someone finds out that they are infected by developing symptoms or testing positive, it’s already been two or three days since they were exposed, and they may have already been infectious for a day or two. So after five days of isolation, they’re really on day seven or eight of their infection. As a result, we estimate that there is a low risk associated with isolation periods of five days or more.” Does Omicron behave differently from previous variants in terms of its period of infectiousness? Scientists say Omicron may infect people more quickly, but possibly for a shorter period than previous variants. “However, we need to find out if that is the case as soon as possible,” said Quilty. “We also need to make sure that people are not isolating for an unnecessarily long time, especially if this becomes a very acute staffing crisis.” The need for further research is also backed by epidemiologist Prof Dame Anne Johnson, of University College London. “There is a large variability in how infectious people are and how much virus they shed. So we need more studies to understand when it’s reasonable for people to be released from quarantine – though we need to face the fact that we cannot eliminate all risk.”
Johnson added that she wanted to see more data on the distribution of viral loads in different people according to their symptoms and at different times of their infection. “We need to better understand how infectious individuals are likely to be at different times and to know when infectivity drops off,” she said. What is the probable long-term outlook for the latest variant? Most scientists are now more optimistic about the likely impact of Omicron, though they worry about the short-term effect it might have on hospitalisations. “In a population that was previously unexposed to a virus, it takes time – through natural infections and vaccines – to get to the situation where you have gradually built up immunity in the population to the extent that people will be getting infected without much impact,” said Johnson. “That is the general direction we are travelling in – as long as we don’t get a new variant that is so different it causes a lot of disease.” • This article was amended on 2 January 2022.

6097;6097;Rodri’s injury-time strike gives City win as 10-man Arsenal blame VAR;2022-01-01T14:46:06Z;['Nick Ames'];['Premier League', 'Arsenal', 'Manchester City', 'Football', 'Sport'];"One can only hope the Arteta residence has thick walls. Arsenal’s manager, who had said he would “need a big room” before watching this fixture from home, must have been clawing at them after an unruly, fractious affair his players deserved to win. The fact they left with nothing owed to a five-minute tailspin of mistakes and poor decision-making that did a disservice to an otherwise exceptional performance. A sluggish Manchester City were battered for sustained periods but snuck an added-time win through Rodri, who was showered by plastic bottles as he celebrated with teammates.
Arsenal were a goal up through the electric Bukayo Saka when this game turned and, on the strength of their first 53 minutes, that was the least they merited. Nobody does this to City, so the logic goes, but Arsenal had. The league leaders had barely mounted an attack since the early stages, thanking near misses and desperate defending for retaining a serious interest. They had been stretched to within an inch of their lives but were handed their way back on a plate. City had hardly posed a threat after half-time when, in a rare moment of clarity, they spread the play and afforded Bernardo Silva a run at Granit Xhaka inside the box. When Silva crumpled before reaching the byline it appeared, at first glance, to be an act of desperation. He had, after all, not been in the game. But the forward’s protestations were particularly vehement and when VAR had a look it was clear he had a case. Xhaka had grabbed a chunk of his shirt and from there the decision was a formality: Stuart Attwell took a short spell in front of his monitor to make it and, via a spate of handbags, Riyad Mahrez swept in the penalty. Xhaka had been outstanding until then but cannot shake off these moments of self-destruction. Gabriel Martinelli blasted off target straight afterwards when it looked easier to score, after chaotic City defending that was entirely of a piece with their display, and Arsenal’s fortunes immediately deteriorated further.
A relieved Ederson, whose miscommunication with Aymeric Laporte had created the chance, took the goal kick and found Gabriel Jesus, who turned past Gabriel Magalhães near halfway. Gabriel had been booked for dissent in the skirmishes before Mahrez stepped up; if anyone had a word in his ear to suggest lying low in the aftermath it did not show and as soon as he checked Jesus the referee had little choice. In receiving a second daft yellow card, Gabriel had given City a lifeline.
They laboured in taking it. City, missing Phil Foden and looking a yard short in all areas, hogged possession thereafter but rarely created a chance. Pot shots from the edge of the penalty box were wayward and it felt like one of those days when pocketing an away point does little harm. But with the clock two minutes past regulation time Rob Holding, brought on to shore things up, could only glance a header into Laporte’s path and the City defender’s shot was blocked. Rodri, following up, squeezed his effort past Aaron Ramsdale. His goal secured the kind of win that may mean the title is wrapped up before May; it is hard to imagine City being pushed this hard too often.
The Emirates seethed with perceived injustice but that things had changed so starkly was not primarily the officials’ fault. There was an added element to the home fans’ anger: in the 10th minute Attwell had not been summoned to the screen for a review when the VAR official, Jarred Gillett, mulled over a tackle by Ederson on Martin Ødegaard. It appeared Ederson had made contact with the ball before his opponent’s ankle, but Arsenal were left feeling the important calls had only gone one way. “On both, in real time he said no penalty but only gets told to look at one,” Ramsdale said afterwards. Such confusion is an infuriating byproduct of VAR but, ultimately, none of the decisions were obviously wrong. When the dust has settled it would be as well for the angered masses to take pleasure in Arsenal’s application. They had struggled miserably in this fixture for nearly a decade but the complexion was entirely different here and they showed no sign of missing the Covid-stricken Arteta. Saka’s goal, just after the half-hour, was swept in from 15 yards after an intelligent pass from Kieran Tierney and could have been added to.
Martinelli, another player impossible to ignore, was denied by Ederson and twice shot just wide after creating chances for himself. Thomas Partey, now lost to the Africa Cup of Nations, ran the midfield and City had no answer to a slick, smooth Arsenal’s aggression. At the end, though, Arteta’s home furnishings might have felt the force of his.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report
6098;6098;US experts question whether counting Covid cases is still the right approach;2022-01-01T14:34:57Z;['N/A'];['US news', 'Omicron variant', 'Coronavirus'];"Some US infectious disease experts and public health officials are questioning whether to continue using the number of coronavirus cases as a metric for determining which mitigation efforts are appropriate, as data suggests Omicron is less severe but much more contagious than previous variants.
Those experts argue that the US has reached a stage in the pandemic where reports of dramatic surges in case counts prompt unnecessary worries and that government officials and the public should instead review death and hospitalization data when considering precautions. Case counts “are causing a lot of panic and fear, but they don’t reflect what they used to, which was that hospitalizations would track with cases”, said Dr Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco. However, other infectious disease experts say that while they are encouraged by data from South Africa showing that its recent Omicron wave was not accompanied by a significant increase in deaths, the virus continues to strain hospitals in the US, therefore the number of Covid cases remains a vital measurement. The US on Thursday had more than 580,000 new Covid cases, the second time this week that the country has broken its record for daily Covid cases, according to New York Times data. But over the past two weeks, while the number of Covid cases in the United States has increased by 181%, the number of hospitalizations has increased by 19% and the number of deaths has decreased by 5%. “It seems to be less virulent for two reasons,” said Gandhi. “One, we seem to have so much more immunity in December 2021” than during previous waves, and “there are now five laboratory studies that show that it doesn’t seem to infect lungs very well”. In reporting data on Covid, health departments should now take the same approach as they do with influenza, Gandhi said. That means releasing hospitalization and death data but not numbers concerning case counts because, like with the flu, it’s not possible to eliminate the virus, therefore we should only focus on its severity, she said. “Once you have accepted the virus is endemic, just like influenza, then you never track cases because we never screen like this for any other viruses, we track what is causing disease and getting people hospitalized,” Gandhi said. Other countries are now implementing an approach that is not focused on case counts. For example, in Canada, which has also seen record numbers of Covid cases recently, Dr Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health, said at a news conference Thursday that the government agency would no longer focus on daily case counts. “We no longer need to identify and have public health manage every single case of the variant because for most people, that will result in relatively mild illness, so we need to focus our efforts and resources on our most vulnerable groups,” said Strang. “Omicron is all around us and we have to recognize that you could be exposed anywhere … It’s about managing and slowing down the spread but not eliminating it.” The Philippines government also announced this week that it would stop posting case updates on social media, which was similar to an approach employed by Singapore, according to Hawaii Public Radio. But in the US, there are parts of the country where hospitals remains overwhelmed, largely because of unvaccinated patients with Covid. In Maryland, for example, which saw a more than 500% increase in Covid cases and 50% increase in hospitalizations, at least six hospitals have implemented crisis-mode standards of care, according to the Baltimore Sun. At Johns Hopkins Bayview medical center, which saw a 360% increase in patients hospitalized with Covid in December, that means rescheduling elective surgical procedures and opening additional space to treat Covid patients. Justin Lessler, an epidemiology professor at the University of North Carolina, still sees case counts as an “important leading indicator”, he said. “With Omicron are surges are so big, even if it’s on average … much less severe than previous variants, the sheer number of cases is such that hospital systems are going to be overwhelmed and there is risks to individuals because it’s so likely you will be infected.” Mara Aspinall, a biomedical diagnostics professor at Arizona State University, also said case count data remains important because it prevents the public from overreacting or underreacting to the pandemic. “The challenge we have had this whole time is finding that balance between keeping our physical health in check, but our mental health and the economy moving forward, and it’s all with the best information” that we are able to do that, Aspinall said. For Gandhi, that balance lies in health departments tracking case counts internally and only alerting the public on hospitalizations and deaths. “The reason we tracked cases is because we were hoping we could eliminate the virus, but it’s not in the nature of the virus to eliminate it,” said Gandhi. “The country hasn’t totally transitioned to this idea that we can’t eliminate it.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/01/us-covid-case-counts-omicron
6099;6099;Bans on hospital visitors necessary ‘last resort’ in coming weeks, NHS chief says;2022-01-01T14:25:00Z;['Jedidajah Otte'];['Coronavirus'];"A “very tough” few weeks will put the health service under such enormous pressure that hospital bosses could be forced to reintroduce a ban on visitors if they have not done so already, a health chief has said. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, told BBC Breakfast on Saturday: “Hospital managers have to make very difficult choices and excluding visitors is one of those very difficult choices. “It’s not something that anybody wants to do. It’s a last resort. But, when you’re facing the kind of pressures the health service is going to be under for the next few weeks, this is the kind of thing managers have to do. “I understand how much people want to return to normal and I’m confident that, as this year progresses, we will be able to do that, and we all hope that 2022 is the year in which coronavirus just becomes an illness that we live with, not an illness that dominates our lives. But you can have the optimism but still recognise the next few weeks are going to be very tough and we need to do whatever is necessary to get us through these next few weeks.” Earlier this week, the Times reported that the government was also considering creating a rule that hospitals should not force women to give birth or attend scans without their partners present, even if tougher restrictions were deemed necessary to curb the spread of Omicron. The NHS effort to deal with Omicron is being hampered because substantial numbers of patients cannot be discharged from hospital despite being fit to return home, NHS leaders have said.
NHS England figures show that 9,213 patients were forced to stay in hospital on Christmas Day because they could not be supported to go home. On Boxing Day, the number of patients in hospital for more than three weeks who were unable to leave had reached 4,124. Some care homes are not accepting patients because they do not have the staff to deal with them, according to Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers. Staff absences also mean that hospitals in England are unable to deal with some non-urgent treatments, such as physiotherapy and rehabilitation, which are vital for enabling patients to leave hospital. In some hospitals, up to a quarter of beds are filled by people who could otherwise be discharged, Hopson said. The NHS situation report, published on Friday, showed that medical staff had managed to help more than 10,000 people a day leave hospital in the run-up to Christmas. Staff absences due to Covid have more than doubled in the past month, from 11,375 on 29 November to 24,632 by Boxing Day. “We saw some progress in the run-up to Christmas in discharging patients who were medically fit to return home or other community settings,” Hopson said. “That reflected a lot of work to free up capacity to prepare for the threat from Omicron. But this remains a real problem and we know from talking to trust chief executives that in some hospitals delayed discharges can account for 20-25% of the bed base. “In the last 48 hours, trust CEOs have been pointing to the fact that growing staff absences mean it’s getting harder to maintain NHS rehabilitation and step-down services, and there are similar problems in social care. We’re also now hearing of some care homes being closed to new admissions because of staff absences, or Omicron outbreaks, or both.” The news comes as the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said further restrictions on freedom in England “must be an absolute last resort”, amid a record-breaking wave of infections due to the Omicron variant. The current wave will, however, “test the limits of finite NHS capacity even more than a typical winter”, Javid said, as hospital admissions in England climbed to their highest since last January. Writing in the Daily Mail, Javid said England had “welcomed in 2022 with some of the least restrictive measures in Europe”, after the government decided against ramping up protective rules – a move that put Downing Street at odds with leaders of the devolved countries, who had opted for restrictions on nightclubs, other hospitality venues and new year celebrations. “Curbs on our freedom must be an absolute last resort and the British people rightly expect us to do everything in our power to avert them,” Javid wrote. “Since I came into this role six months ago I’ve also been acutely conscious of the enormous health, social and economic costs of lockdowns. So I’ve been determined that we must give ourselves the best chance of living alongside the virus and avoiding strict measures in the future.” Despite his optimism, the health secretary said the time lag between infections and hospital admissions meant it was “inevitable that we will still see a big increase” in the number of people with Covid needing treatment over the next month, and warned that the pandemic was “still far from over”.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/hospitals-may-have-to-reintroduce-visitor-bans-health-chief-says

Liverpool confirmed that their manager is now isolating after reporting “mild symptoms” in the buildup to Sunday’s fixture. Klopp said in Friday’s pre-match press conference that Liverpool had three fresh Covid cases within the playing squad, all currently unnamed. “We never had this proper outbreak where 15 to 20 players had it [Covid],” he said. “For us it is every day, another one, stuff happens more and more often. It’s like a lottery waiting for the results.” The assistant manager Pepijn Lijnders will lead the team for the 4.30pm kick-off at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool revealed that testing of the entire first-team set-up revealed no further positive cases within the playing squad in addition to the three confirmed by Klopp on Friday but three backroom staff members have returned suspected positive results.;https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/jurgen-klopp-to-miss-liverpools-trip-to-chelsea-after-positive-covid-19-test
6101;6101;Munroe Bergdorf: ‘Transition was an act of love for myself’;2022-01-01T14:00:04Z;['Nick McGrath'];['Life and style', 'Transgender', 'Munroe Bergdorf'];I grew up under the Tories’ Section 28 designation in Stansted Mountfitchet in Essex. That was difficult. It prohibited teachers from promoting homosexuality, which meant they couldn’t condemn homophobic bullying, either. I experienced a lot of bullying. I see my transition as beautiful – it was an act of love for myself. I didn’t know how I was going to look at the end, but it was born the faith that I would be happier. I try not to think too much about what other people think. I try to focus on looking how I feel. That’s what’s brought me most happiness in my life Bravery comes with healing. We all go through awful stuff. We’re all traumatised in one way or another. Life is hard. Bravery comes from confronting what you’ve been traumatised by. I’m very conscious of the fact that tomorrow isn’t promised. We need to do everything we can with every day we have. The first time I felt gender euphoria was when a dear friend bought me a pair of very high, very chic Christian Louboutin heels. I put them on and instantly felt like the woman I wanted to be. I feel like with the internet we’ve lost the art of conversation. We need to get back to actually being able to find a common place, to push past disagreements. There’s nuance to the human experience. Nothing positive comes from seeing each other in 2D. When Alexander McQueen passed, I felt the warmth drain from my body. It was a massive loss. What he did with his shows, how he presented them, was incomparable and unsurpassed. I’m trying to get back into having experiences in nature. I grew up in a very rural area, so I’m enjoying going to nature reserves and national parks and Hampstead Heath and just bonding in real life. The takeaway from the pandemic is that there’s nothing like human energy. Being around those who support you and love you is an incomparable experience. Music always transports me, I learned early that it’s a therapeutic tool, a way to process or bring out feelings, to change the way you feel. When I need joy in my life, I tap into nostalgia and listen to music that reminds me of better times. I want to have children in five years. When you’re trans and unable to produce children myself with my own body, it’s obviously something that takes a lot of planning. But I love kids. I try not to regret anything. It’s a waste of energy. I’m more focused on learning from the lessons I take from the things that I’m not proud of. We all make mistakes.

6102;6102;Desmond Tutu laid to rest at state funeral in Cape Town ;2022-01-01T13:29:07Z;['Jason Burke'];['Desmond Tutu', 'South Africa', 'World news'];"Just after noon, as the voices of the choir filled the cathedral, the mourners stood, bowed their heads in the direction of the plain wooden casket and then filed out on to Cape Town’s streets. The requiem mass for Desmond Tutu, who died aged 90 six days ago, had lasted much of the morning, long enough for a celebration of a life that has inspired tens of millions around the world, a final farewell from his compatriots, and for the unexpected rainclouds that had shrouded his home city overnight to clear.
Now, sunlight streamed through the stained glass windows and the distinctive profile of Table Mountain was etched against a typically blue South African sky. “He never stopped fighting, he never stopped speaking out, and never stopped caring. He was a crusader in the struggle for freedom, justice, equality and peace not only in [South Africa] but around the world as well,” said South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in his eulogy to the charismatic, diminutive former English teacher whose non-violent struggle against the racist, repressive apartheid regime was recognised with a Nobel prize in 1984. “A global icon [due to] exceptional moral stature and service to humanity … We are diminished by his passing. His life straddled an epoch in our country’s history that has now come to an end,” Ramaphosa, a former labour activist who fought alongside Tutu, said. The last surviving major leader of the anti-apartheid struggle, Tutu will be remembered for both his steely determination in the face of violent oppression and his impish humour, which he deployed to inspire supporters, win new allies and confound enemies. The Rev Michael Weeder, the Dean of Cape Town, quoted the singer Billie Holiday, saying that Tutu’s trademark smile had moved people “like the wind that shakes the bough”. “His smile calmed and focused those who saw it, whether in person or from afar,” Weeder told mourners. With only a hundred people allowed into Saint George’s Cathedral in central Cape Town due to Covid restrictions, many had chosen to pay their respects earlier in the week. Hundreds had queued to stand before the closed casket for a few moments in contemplation or sign a book of condolences. Others had placed flowers beneath a portrait of “the Arch”, as Tutu was familiarly known locally. Many remembered Tutu’s role during the long dark years of struggle, when, as a senior cleric, he turned Saint George’s into a hub of political organising as well as a sanctuary of faith. When the apartheid regime banned political gatherings, Tutu held meetings in the cathedral where participants bowed their heads ostensibly in prayer and heard political speeches. Nelson Mandela, a close friend and collaborator of Tutu, called the Anglican church the “people’s cathedral”. Brita Lomba, a 66-year-old photographer and former anti-apartheid activist, said Tutu had been “irrepressible” during the years of struggle. “He stood for values that no one could disagree with … but the most powerful thing was simply how he was as a human being, the way he was,” said Lomba, who had joined a hundred or so others in the square in front of Cape Town’s city hall to watch a live broadcast of the mass on a big screen. Beatrice Brenton, who had begged a lift into Cape Town to watch the funeral because she lacked money for the bus fare, said she remembered Tutu “dancing and laughing”. “He was a very precious, special person all through my life,” the 83-year-old said. Following the collapse of the apartheid regime and South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, Tutu took on the harrowing role of leading the country’s path-breaking Truth and Reconciliation Commission which investigated apartheid-era crimes to bring closure to victims and the nation. This profound commitment to “healing South Africa”, as well as Tutu’s trademark impish grin and joyful laugh, inspired Lerato Jatto to bring her family to watch the funeral. Jatto, who left South Africa for the UK in 1991 but was in Cape Town on holiday, said that Tutu’s work with the victims and perpetrators had shown other parts of the world how to “heal their own wounds … when something so tragic happens”. Nearby, Zinthe Tsele, a 25-year-old worker in a Cape Town spice-packing factory, said she had come with her sister to be “part of the celebration of [Tutu’s] life”. “We learned about him at school. I think people today should listen to Tutu’s message. He didn’t do anything for himself. He lived in a very small home. He was not like today’s politicians. For them it is about power not the people,” Tsele said. Dubbed the “moral compass” or “conscience” of South Africa, Tutu did not flinch from trenchant criticism of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party, embarrassing senior politicians whom he accused of riding a “gravy train”. In his eulogy, Ramaphosa, who has struggled to reform the ANC since taking power almost four years ago, admitted that South Africa faced “problems and challenges everywhere” and that “poverty, inequality, racism, homophobia, gender-based violence, crime and corruption have left many people disenchanted”. Though Tutu, who suffered from prostate cancer for more than 20 years, largely retreated from public life in recent years, he had continued his lifelong fight for causes he believed in, forcefully supporting LGBT rights, equal access to education and the assisted dying movement. In a videoed message, the Rev Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said that Tutu “lit up the world”. “When we were in the dark, he brought light and that light has lit up countries [across the world] struggling with conflict or where the marginalised have suffered. He never failed to bring light, and his light did not fade but grew brighter. [He] is shedding light for those on the edge and those who suffer to this day and in the future,” Welby said in a video message broadcast during the mass. That Covid regulations prevented easy travel may have been a relief to some leaders on the African continent who might otherwise have been expected to attend the funeral. Watching the final moments of the ceremony on the big screen, Francis Sithole, a child youth worker from neighbouring Zimbabwe, said leaders of his country should also heed Tutu’s message. “He spoke the truth. They need to think about what he was preaching,” Sithole, 43, said. In a sermon, Michael Nuttall, the former bishop of Natal who was a close friend and collaborator of Tutu, told mourners: “Desmond was not on some crusade of personal aggrandisement or egotism, though he often and disarmingly admitted that he loved to be loved. “His was not a harsh, ideological quest for justice. Always it was grounded in mercy … in an enduring loving-kindness: the gentle touch, the forgiving heart, the warm smile.” Tutu, who specifically requested an environmentally friendly funeral without lavish expense or ostentation, will be cremated and his ashes interred beneath the floor of St George’s, “a place that he loved”, church officials said.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/funeral-of-desmond-tutu-takes-place-in-cape-town
6103;6103;Time to stockpile olives? Shortages as delis are hit by new Brexit import rules;2022-01-01T13:09:23Z;['Toby Helm', 'Tom Wall'];['Brexit', 'European Union', 'Politics', 'Europe', 'Boris Johnson', 'Food', 'Life and style', 'Retail industry', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Consumer affairs'];"After a few minutes in the queue spent eyeing up the best on offer at the local deli, it is decision time. Maybe some of the wonderful Parma ham from Italy? With a few slices of Spanish chorizo? And a piece of brie from that farm in Normandy … oh, and definitely some of the black olives from Greece. The government may be making light of new and burdensome Brexit rules and regulations affecting imports to Great Britain from the EU that came into force on 1 January, but organisations representing small UK firms are not. The firms are worried about the impact on their businesses – and about the choices that will be available to their customers at their favourite specialist stores – on the high street. The Federation of Small Businesses cites local delicatessens, many of which import from small specialist suppliers in the EU, as the type of operators that could be adversely affected. “The classic example is your high street deli that is importing delicacies like, say, chorizo from Spain or parmesan from Italy,” says James Sibley, the federation’s head of international affairs. “For them, the thought of having to register for these systems is daunting and the process is expensive, so we’ve a lot of concern there. For those small businesses directly affected, we have picked up a lot of worry.” The hit to small EU exporters to the UK could be similar to that experienced by UK exporters to the EU over the past year, many of which simply gave up selling goods to the continent because post-Brexit export rules made it too much of a bother and too expensive to carry on. From the beginning of last year UK exporters faced extra paperwork, and added costs, and their customers were stung by resulting higher prices – despite the claims by Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and other Brexiteers that leaving the EU would reduce regulation and lead to lower prices. Now, Sibley says, the effects could be similar for small importers to those that faced UK exporters in 2021. “It is the inverse of what has happened to UK exporters over the past year. We know that a fifth of our exporting members have stopped exporting to the EU, because of that disruption.” Rules that came into force January 1 require businesses (in most cases those receiving the goods in the UK, but in some those sending them here) to notify the customs authorities of precisely what is being sent to Great Britain from the EU, and from where. The rules were in effect waived throughout 2021. The process will require the exporter to acquire and then submit an Eori number (economic operators registration and identification number) to their UK customers so the importers can then input a lot of data and send it off to the UK authorities. If the goods arrive with incomplete paperwork, they can be seized, confiscated or sent back. Sibley says there is evidence that many EU exporters are unprepared for what is about to hit them. “What we are hearing is that there are some EU traders who are not ready for any of this even to the extent of not having this number, so that is a concern.” Then on 1 July this year, more regulations and checks will come in. “From then, exporters will also need export health certificates or veterinary certificates if they are exporting products of animal origin or foodstuffs. That is a point at which some EU exporters might just say, ‘You know what, forget this. It is not worth the hassle’.” Sibley adds: “Also in July you will have physical inspections of goods at border posts in the UK, so again that could lead to delays because you will essentially have a vet with a clipboard going through the lorry saying ‘this is right, this is fine, (or not)’.” Business groups say the problems will affect mainly smaller operators, as bigger concerns can afford to pay customs agents or freight forwarders to handle the paperwork for them.
On UK high streets, some shop owners are already worrying about gaps appearing on their shelves in 2022, and about rising prices. El Colmado, Bristol’s only Spanish deli, imports pretty much everything: chorizo sausages, huge serrano hams and glossy green olives. Its owner, David Pavon, expects more disruption and rising prices when importers are required to make real-time custom declarations, input details of food imports into various customs systems, and obtain special codes for lorries to board ferries. “Logistics problems have increased during the past year already because of the havoc coming into England,” he says. “So I imagine in January we’re going to see even more delays, because if a lorry driver needs to sit in the border for six hours or more, we will need to pay his wages. We are paying customs agents in Spain and here to input the information [required for import], which increases the price as well.” Pavon, 41, has already put his prices up – and expects to have to do so again in 2022. “They are still going up and you will see an increase and an increase,” he says. “Someone is making money along the way but you and me are going to have to pay for it.” The wholesalers supplying delis and specialist food shops have similar worries. Reading-based Cotswold Fayre, which supplies hundreds of premium food lines, including European favourites such as stollen and panettone, to independent retailers throughout the UK, has been forced to budget for delays and cost increases on imported goods instead of investing in creating new jobs. “It’s not what we want to do – I would rather spend on starting another shop, but if we have to we will [absorb extra costs],” says Paul Hargreaves, the company’s founder. Hargreaves, who recently met his local MP, Alok Sharma, feels that the government does not understand the impact of Brexit on British businesses. “[Ministers] are not in the real world. They think things are a lot easier than they actually are. That is highly frustrating,” he says. “If they had to experience it for themselves, perhaps there might have been a bit more effort to do a better Brexit deal. The perception is that the ideology [of Brexit] is more important than the practicalities to businesses in the UK.” • The headline and text of this article were amended on 1 January 2022 to correctly refer to Great Britain rather than the UK in specific reference to the new regulations.";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/uk-shops-fear-gaps-shelves-brexit-import-rules-prices-shortages-delis
6104;6104;Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts review – perilously close to emetic;2022-01-01T13:02:22Z;['Lucy Mangan'];['Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Television', 'Harry Potter'];"The John Williams score plays (with added bells for the festive season), the camera soars above an ersatz Victorian street, wax-sealed letters appear – and just like that, anyone who came of reading or viewing age from 1997 onwards is home. The Harry Potter reunion special Return to Hogwarts, marking 20 years since the first film adaptation of JK Rowling’s gamechanging and multi-multi-million-selling fantasy series about the boy wizard was released, hews as closely to the original’s aesthetic as possible from the off. Chats among the three main stars, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry himself), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), take place in the Gryffindor common room, there’s an opening set piece in the Hogwarts dining hall, Radcliffe and director of the first two films, Chris Columbus, talk in Dumbledore’s office and so on. It provides a rush of nostalgia only heightened as the enduring affection among them all becomes evident. There is much – rising perilously if perhaps inevitably close to emetic levels – of the cast and crew being like a family. There always is in programmes like this, but at least here it is more than usually justified. The actors famously began working on the franchise when they were children, and their audience grew up alongside them pretty much in real time as the films were released between 2001 and 2011.
One of what you might assume to be a central member of the family, however, is conspicuous by her absence – the creator of Harry Potter and his world, the author JK Rowling. An essay she published in 2020 giving her views on the impact of gender ideology on women’s rights was widely denounced as transphobic. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson distanced themselves from her. According to her agents, the controversy played no part in her decision not to take part in the reunion and she felt that the 2019 interview footage of her used here (mostly recalling the difficulty of finding someone to play Harry) would be presence enough. Whatever the true degree of her choice in the matter, and despite various fond mentions of “Jo” from Radcliffe and others throughout the special, a void remains. But around it there is charm, warmth, charisma – especially when Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) blows in like the world’s most glorious hurricane – and even a little new information amid well-worn anecdotes. Yes, we hear again how Alfonso Cuarón, who directed the third Potter film, made the central trio write essays about their characters and true to form, Watson handed in a perfect dozen pages, Radcliffe mustered half a side of A4 and Grint didn’t bother. But we also hear about Alan Rickman getting the inside line from Rowling early on about Snape’s ultimate motivation and telling not a soul, Watson’s growing loneliness as the pressures on her grew greater, and about the deep fondness between Watson and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) and the crush Radcliffe had on Bonham Carter. There are also moments of tangential insight, into the scale of the endeavour (such as when one of the three remembers being told that the casting announcement would be made that afternoon and that the media would descend – “So you can’t go home”), and Radcliffe’s maturity beyond his years from the start. He makes several references to watching the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Gary Oldman, Timothy Spall and many others from the British thespian firmament doing “proper acting”, and his longing to and delight in learning from them is still palpable. It is a slick and calculated production, designed to give Potterheads exactly what they want, how they want it. But it contains enough untold stories and honesty from the participants and unfakeable camaraderie to give it more genuine heart than probably anyone expected. Perhaps in another 20 years they will let Rowling back in, too.";https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/01/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-return-to-hogwarts-review-perilously-close-to-emetic
6105;6105;Can’t quit, won’t quit: confessions of a die-hard smoker;2022-01-01T13:00:04Z;['N/A'];['Smoking', 'Life and style', 'Health', 'Social trends', 'Society', 'Psychology', 'Science', 'New year'];"I have asthma, and there’s a fairly major respiratory disease going around, as you may have heard, and also I am a smoker. A quick inventory of my coat pockets: inhaler, face mask, Marlboro Gold. I never fell into smoking as a teenager when everyone else seemed to think it was cool, but took it up in my 30s, as others might develop an interest in birdwatching, or CrossFit. Four or five a day, for the best part of a decade, and more at the weekends. This piece is anonymous because my mother cannot know. I don’t have the words to express how unbelievably stupid I feel about all this. There’s quite a lot going on here, and not all of it is solely of interest to me and my therapist. You might imagine that a continuing and lung-buggering international emergency which a study says is specifically more dangerous for smokers would mean there were fewer idiots like me. But in fact, stress and boredom are more than a match for serious health concerns: research published in August last year suggested that the number of young adults smoking in England went up by about a quarter during the first lockdown. There was a spike in the number of people across all ages giving up smoking in England during that same first lockdown period – but no sign of the plummeting rates you might rationally expect. Then again, nothing about this habit has ever been rational.
For my own part, I don’t know exactly what kind of smoker I am, but I know I’m not casual, or social: I’m highly committed to something very unpopular. The persistence of the packet in my pocket is not for the want of trying. It’s more for a want of wanting. My figurative heart just isn’t in it, although my literal heart would probably have quite strong opinions in the opposite direction. (Unlucky, literal heart, only sentient organs get a vote!) I don’t suppose I speak for the other 1.1bn people still grimly puffing away, but it feels as if my problem is that I still, somewhere in my lizard brain, think this habit that makes me smell awful and look desperate is … cool, a deftly executed little ritual that makes me a more compelling figure to people at a party. Did you feel cool when you were a teenager, my therapist asks, and it’s obvious to us both that the question is a rhetorical one.
That makes a grim sort of sense, but it’s probably also a crutch, and a way to ignore the obvious fact that I’m addicted. After all, I’ve barely been to any parties for quite a long time and, apart from the neighbour’s terminally unimpressed cat, there’s no audience when I’m huddled in the back garden on a rainy Tuesday morning getting ash on myself. I started, for reasons I don’t fully understand, as some sort of warped, bloody-minded reinvention shortly after a breakup. I should have known from my permanent inability to leave half a pack of sweets in a cupboard for the next day that it wouldn’t work; before long I had slipped from a pack a month to one every few days. I wish I had properly understood then how insidious an addiction nicotine would turn out to be, how misleading and unhelpful the term “craving” would prove, at least for me: it suggests a siren in your brain when you go without, when the truth is something more like the little fillip you get when it occurs to you that you’d like a cup of tea and a biscuit. I don’t often leave it long enough to be faced with a more powerful compulsion than that, but because it doesn’t seem especially intense, I almost always give in to it. I think I have a constitutional weakness for treats. I still don’t think I really, deeply, want to stop, or understand how urgently I have to. But I know I don’t want this bleak internal monologue motoring in my head any more: an endless, boring chunter that slides into my mind any time I’m not thinking about anything much. It may be that the pandemic’s additional opportunities for mental drift has helped me reach at least this caveated breakthrough, because in 2021 I started Juul-ing. Whereas previous attempts failed spectacularly – the time I lit up while chewing Nicorette is a particular low point – this time, I’ve gone more than a week between cigarettes, at the cost of an umbilical attachment to a mysterious little obelisk whose long-term impacts remain unknown. I buy menthol vape pods in bulk and feel nervous if the battery light blinks red. I always come back to smoking in the end, but the gaps are getting a bit longer, and a bit easier to tolerate. None of this is consoling. Helpful though the vaping is, and good though I feel about smoking less, I seem to be stuck on it as a harm-reduction method, not a step towards kicking the habit. I tell myself that once all this – I am waving my hands at the universe – has eased off a little, I’ll really get on with it.
The prospect of slowly killing myself is fixed as an abstraction. I feel I’d stop if I were having a kid, but that might just be another rationalisation for putting it off. So here I am, the sort of person who vapes behind their hand in Zoom meetings, and blows a conspicuous little cloud out of the corner of his mouth as if anyone’s not going to notice it because it comes out sideways. I miss being the person I was before I smoked, when I had no idea how much of a luxury it was never to have thought about it, and I know that even if I succeed in giving up nicotine completely, that victory will be shadowed by an obscure sense of loss. I also can’t believe how much less funny this piece is than I meant it to be. But maybe, two years into a global pandemic, that counts for personal growth: the ability to face the absurdity of the harm you are doing to yourself as something more consequential than a morbid joke.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/cant-quit-wont-quit-confessions-of-a-die-hard-smoker
6106;6106;What links Licorice Pizza to The Gong Show?;2022-01-01T13:00:03Z;['Larry Ryan'];['Paul Thomas Anderson', 'Charlie Kaufman', 'Philip Seymour Hoffman', 'Haim', 'Film', 'Culture'];"Valley PTA Paul Thomas Anderson’s ninth cinematic symphony hits UK screens next week: Licorice Pizza returns the director to his native LA’s San Fernando Valley in the 1970s, previously seen in his 1997 breakout Boogie Nights. The latter tackled the era’s porn scene, the new effort is a more wholesome coming-of-age story (Funny! Relaxed! Delectable! says the Guardian) – some have dubbed it “Boogie Days”. Newcomers Cooper Hoffman and Alana Haim lead the line.
Phantom threads Alana Haim is a member of the sister-based pop rock group Haim. The trio has long been associated with Anderson, who has directed several of their music videos. But it turns out the sisters’ mother, Donna Rose, was his elementary school art teacher – “a huge influence”, he says.
Inherent gong As well as inspiring a modern auteur, Donna was a winning entrant on The Gong Show; she sang a Bonnie Raitt number – no gongs! (Husband Moti, meanwhile, was once a professional footballer; those Haims contain multitudes.)
There may be blood Chuck Barris was the host of The Gong Show and creator of other trash telly: in 1984 he infamously wrote an “unauthorised autobiography”, dubiously claiming he had been a CIA assassin. With Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, George Clooney turned the tall story into his underrated 2002 directorial debut(rent it everywhere). Charlie Kaufman wrote the screenplay – though later voiced his disapproval.
The masters Kaufman’s own directorial debut was the mind-bending Synecdoche, New York, with Philip Seymour Hoffman as a theatre director whose work swallows his world. Hoffman was also a muse to Anderson across several films (is Punch-Drunk Love quietly their best?), until his death in 2014. Now his son Cooper has picked up the PTA baton (usually we’re dubious of nepotism, but maybe we can wave this through).

Celebrating mass in St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, on the day the Roman Catholic church marks its annual World Day of Peace, Francis wove his new year’s homily around the themes of motherhood and women, saying it was they who kept the threads of life together. He used the message to make one of his strongest pleas yet for an end to violence against them. “And since mothers bestow life, and women keep the world [together], let us all make greater efforts to promote mothers and to protect women,” he said. “How much violence is directed against women. Enough. To hurt a woman is to insult God, who from a woman took on our humanity – not through an angel, not directly, but through a woman.” Francis, 85, has spoken out in recent times about domestic violence. Last month, during an Italian television programme, he told a woman who had been beaten by her ex-husband that men who commit violence against women engage in something that is “almost satanic”. Francis appeared to be in good form on Saturday following an unexplained incident on New Year’s Eve where he attended a service but at the last minute did not preside over it as had been expected. At the start of the mass, he walked the entire length of the central aisle of the basilica, as opposed to Friday night, when he emerged from a side entrance close to the altar and watched from the sidelines. The pontiff suffers from a sciatica condition that causes pain in the legs, and sometimes a flare-up prevents him from standing for long periods. Public participation at the mass was lower than in past years because of Covid restrictions, according to reports. In the pope’s message for the World Day of Peace, issued last month, Francis said countries should divert money spent on armaments to invest in education, and lamented growing military costs at the expense of social services. The annual peace message is sent to heads of state and international organisations. The pope also gives a signed copy to leaders who make official visits to him at the Vatican.;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/pope-calls-for-end-to-violence-against-women-in-new-year-message

However, it emerged they had taken photos, some showing the bodies, and shared them in two WhatsApp groups. Jaffer resigned from the Met in August, while Lewis was sacked by a disciplinary tribunal. Last month Jaffer and Lewis were each jailed for two years and nine months. Danyal Hussein, 19, was jailed for life in October – with a minimum of 35 years – for the murder of the sisters. Smallman said she had forgiven him. Since her daughters’ deaths, she has campaigned on violence against women and for equity on how victims are seen. When asked what she felt about a police system that produced and allowed two serving officers to photograph her daughters as they did, she replied: “I’m repulsed by them, if I’m honest, and I can’t wait to meet Jaffer. “He said he’d like to meet with the family and I don’t believe he thought that that could happen, but it will because he said he wants it to happen. I’m going to give him that invitation.” The family have planted a cherry tree at Fryent country park in north-west London, where the women were murdered. In October, following an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the Met police apologised to the family for failing in the way it responded when the two women were reported missing. The IOPC found that a missing persons log was incorrectly closed and inquiries were not progressed. The Met commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, said a better response would have saved their family and friends “immeasurable pain”. Smallman told the Today programme “having to fight to find your own children” was horrendous. Asked by the presenter Mishal Husain if the guilty verdicts had allowed her now to “turn a page in some way”, Smallman said: “No, not yet. I think it is probably too soon. I’m looking forward to that time when we can just start grieving. But we don’t know what that looks like yet. “I’ve said once before, it’d be great to have no news, good or bad. We just would like a flat line, just to gather speed and to find our way through the grieving process.” She added that there had been times when she no longer wanted to “be here” and that they had been “dreading” Christmas, but added that her campaigning had helped her. “If anything, this has kept me going,” she explained. “This has given me a reason to stay with it and try to ensure that another family doesn’t have to go through what we’ve been through.”;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/01/mother-of-murdered-sisters-hopes-to-meet-pc-jailed-for-scene-photos
6109;6109;Field day for dogs as owners pay by the hour for safe green spaces;2022-01-01T12:30:59Z;['Donna Ferguson'];['Dogs', 'Pets', 'Coronavirus', 'UK news', 'Farming', 'Animals', 'Life and style'];"Twice a week, in rural Cambridgeshire, Rebecca Lee hires a private field for her dog, Moscow, to run about in for an hour. “Moscow is the world’s most difficult dog,” she said. “If you’ve got a dog like him, who is reactive – he barks and lunges at stuff, mostly because he’s actually quite fearful – then every walk can be traumatic.” By contrast, when she rents the field, she can relax, knowing they are not going to encounter any of Moscow’s “triggers”. These include other dogs, bikes, cars and children. Lee is just one of the thousands of dog owners across the country who regularly hires private land to exercise their pet. The website, dogwalkingfields.com, estimates that about 2,270 acres – the equivalent of 1,700 football pitches – is being used for this purpose via the 756 fields in its directory, with more added each week. “During the pandemic, enclosed fields became a refuge for people who wanted to exercise their dogs away from other people, socially distanced,” said Katherine Shields Smith, co-founder of Dog Walking Fields. “Open spaces were crowded, especially with travel restrictions in place. As restrictions lifted a little, the fields became safe havens to meet up with friends and family and exercise safely.”
The fields typically cost about £10 an hour and are usually surrounded by secure fencing. They are used by owners whose dogs are anxious, injured, disabled, reactive, small, elderly, in season or in training. “The owners of these dogs all appreciate somewhere safe to relax off lead without being approached by other possibly well-meaning but exuberant dogs,” said Shields Smith. In a public place, unsolicited and often unwelcome approaches can cause some owners and dogs distress, leading to conflict – but there is a lack of awareness about this and other aspects of “dog walking etiquette”, she said: “There are lots of dogs who are friendly but whose owners have no control over them.” This problem has worsened during the pandemic, with a lot more inexperienced owners around. Parks and open spaces have become crowded with “pandemic puppies” – many born during lockdown, when puppy training classes were closed and most dog owners were social distancing. Many of these dogs are now poorly socialised adolescents with behaviour problems: over the past six months, animal charities have seen a substantial increase in “lockdown pet regret”, with the RSPCA reporting abandonments are up by 20% in 2021 compared with the previous year’s figures. Ben Webster, a farmer in Coton, near Cambridge, spent £15,000 turning one of his fields into a secure dog field last year. He used to rent it out for sheep grazing for £300 a year. Now, during the summer peak, he can earn up to £400 a week.
“You get a whole mix of people. As well as the owners of dogs who are a bit nervous or not terribly well trained, you get dog-training classes. And you get people in the summer who want to just come, have a glass of wine in the field and let their dogs run around while they sit with friends on the bench and chat for an hour, knowing their dogs will be safe and secure.” The field has a tunnel dogs can run through, tyres they can jump over and a water tap. “In the summer, some people brought paddling pools for their dogs and we had dog parties,” said Webster. Moscow was born during the first lockdown and given up to a rescue centre by his previous owners when they stopped working from home. “He hadn’t had a lead or a collar on him until he was six months old,” said Lee, an author. “I don’t think he’d ever been walked on the pavement. And I think that led to a lot of his issues.” Lee sought the help of a dog behaviourist and started using secure dog fields near her home. This gave her a large, safe space for Moscow. “We are making lots of progress. He can now go on group walks with a dog walker and is great with other dogs he knows.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/field-day-for-dogs-as-owners-pay-by-the-hour-for-safe-green-spaces
6110;6110;Click and collect: my insatiable passion for auction websites;2022-01-01T12:00:02Z;['Eva Wiseman'];['Collecting', 'Hobbies', 'Life and style', 'Design', 'Art and design', 'Interiors', 'Culture', 'Homes'];"Last year I stood in the shallows of my house, a place now ankle-deep with books, pots, pictures and lamps, and I thought: I want more. More books, more pots, more pictures, more lamps. I’d barely left the house in months but still I’d managed to accumulate a warehouse-worth of new tut. I say new – it was all old, nothing made after perhaps 1989, nothing that had not been through at least two previous owners, at least one of those owners now long deceased, the other having woken one day and found themselves a minimalist. Everything was bought, you see, at auction. Specifically at auctions that pre-pandemic I would not have thought to visit, but (after viewings became online-only) I found myself walking through at night, panting. My local auction house is a place out of time, a room Tetris-stacked with chests of drawers and boxes of Beatles magazines, the smell a specific combination of vape and dust. Every weekend I squeeze through the aisles, marvelling at the collections of erotic art or antique computers or nesting tables that have nested so long they have almost hatched. And every weekend I return home with another object that I didn’t need but needed immediately.
My boyfriend looks on with a combination of affection and disgust. His birthday card to me this year was a painting of a 70s lamp he is particularly unfond of, claiming its volcanic glaze looks like semen, and inside a poem which began, “Eva went to auction house, debit card in hand, to feed a strong compulsion that she couldn’t understand. For nightly on the internet and in person once a week, she would browse their sad collection of ugly furniture in teak.” There are five verses, he hates it this much. We live in a home of compromise, pottery and thick-spread affection: “Eva scooped the jizz lamp up as though she were its mother, and rushed it home to meet its ceramic sisters and brothers. Her partner was agog to see this totem of bad taste and asked her why she’d said she was just shopping for toothpaste. But even though he rolled his eyes he knew it was his duty, to love a thing that she loves, and to try and find its beauty.” I’ve tried to explain to him why I’m drawn to these things, and why they continue to fill our shelves. Partly, I say, because they are imbued with memory, partly because their quality is so much better than their Ikea alternatives, partly because there is no fixed price, partly because of the thrill of discovering treasure. You don’t buy things from auction – you win them. I try to bring home only things I know will bring me joy, but the problem is, so much does. I urge him to understand my love of auctions not as a problem but as a hobby. One that leaked online from real life, in that way things do today. I’m reluctant to encourage others to join me as an auction hobbyist because, of course, there is only one fabulous lamp for sale at a time, and there might be a wait of many months before a similarly jizzy one becomes available. But if I were to, if I were a better person and less worried by the competition, then I would recommend approaching the-saleroom.com (where auction houses the world over list their goods) as if visiting a gallery rather than a shop.
I’d advise people to relish the artfully random selection of tchotchkes and design, prioritising the pleasure of looking over the desire to purchase. Sometimes it’s exciting to type in an offensively low bid, because sometimes you win it – on the wall by our front door hangs a painting I bid £10 on, and after picking it up from an office piled with Matisse prints and Dalí objects, discovered the artist’s work hangs at the Whitney in New York. But on the rare occasion when you see something you want – something you absolutely must have – I’d recommend calling the auction house directly (to avoid the online commission) and if possible bidding live. Though that is a dangerous game, one that can leave you quite sick and poor. At night I scroll slowly through abstract landscapes and modernist chairs and mourning rings and haunted dolls, bidding low and often. What is lost when viewing virtually rather than walking through an auction house – the ability to pick things up and turn them over, to enjoy the dissonance of seeing an antique truncheon balanced on a meticulously carved Buddha, or a vintage Chanel hat perched on a very large bear – is gained by the many miles you can travel with your thumb. This week I bought another lamp. How to do it The Saleroom is used by more than 2,000 auction houses worldwide to sell art and antiques online. Live Auctioneers is a similar service and includes jewellery and fashion in available lots. This site features auctions from more than 50 countries. The online design platform 1stdibs also launched a seven-day auction system in December 2021. The site focuses on furniture, home décor, art. For other good secondhand homeware, try Retrouvius, a salvage company which stocks everything from chairs to fireplaces.

6111;6111;Ditching the diet – how I learned to accept the body I have;2022-01-01T12:00:02Z;['Alexandra Jones'];['Diets and dieting', 'Life and style', 'Body image', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Health', 'Society', 'New year'];"Every January, the same old battle cry: this will be the year that I get thin. Last January, I did a week-long juice cleanse, and the year before that, I fasted for three days. It wasn’t quite nil by mouth, but almost. At the time, I told myself the science interested me (the fervour with which fasting evangelists assure you that a few days without food can reset your microbiome or stave off cellular ageing is compelling enough to make you ignore the health warnings). Really, though, what I wanted was rapid weight loss, minimum one dress size. I made it to 81 hours. Practically levitating with hunger, I ignored the advice to reintroduce food slowly (soups and juices before solids) by bingeing on a cheese sandwich, which I promptly threw up. Happy new year to me. This January, though, I have brokered peace with myself – and I am determined to live inside my body as it exists now. No diets, no fasting, cheese sandwiches whenever I want. It won’t be easy at a time when body fascism is taken as common sense. An estimated 26 million British people will vow to lose weight for the new year. As psychoanalyst Dr Susie Orbach tells me, “It makes it very, very difficult to feel OK about your body when the assault on you is so intense.” But I’m going to give it a go. My body is, by most people’s standards, average – a fact that I apply like a balm whenever my thoughts become too barbed. Revelling in one’s “averageness” might not sound like much in a world of declarative self-love, but after a lifetime of body shame, this is a hard-won detente.
I realised a toxic attitude to my body had accrued over time. Much like rocks washing downstream will catch on the bough of a fallen branch, the thought that my body was not acceptable built up incrementally, pebble by pebble, until one day all other thoughts were stopped up by it. One of the earliest diets I remember embarking on was at age 12, when I decided I’d eat only tinned peaches. I can’t quite recall where my concept of fatness and thinness came from at that time – I just remember feeling that I took up a lot of space, in a particularly grotesque way, with soft, dimpled thighs and a vast, unacceptable, rounded stomach. Even now, I rarely look at photos of myself from that time. But when I do come across one I see a perfectly normal-looking child. As a teenager, when I gained weight because of various factors (including the discovery of junk food), embarrassment bloomed into horror. This was the early 00s, the era of objectification as empowerment, when most of the girls at my school dreamed of being glamour models. Culture was dominated by lads’ mags and weight-loss transformation TV shows, both deeply concerned with policing the female body. In fashion, the trend for “heroin chic” – lithe, narrow-hipped – would soon be supplanted by size zero, as seen on Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Nicole Richie, who were all dressed by super-stylist Rachel Zoe; they were catnip for women’s magazines. It was a look so ubiquitous that even as a 13-year-old living in a mining village in Yorkshire, I had to engage. Like most women of my generation, I internalised that particular body type as the ideal and became determined that I’d bring my own body to heel by any means necessary. In my 20s, this included such a vast array of diets – South Beach, Atkins, 5:2, a paid-for subscription to a food-tracking app – that I’d struggle to name them all. And all along, hyper-aware of my size regardless of what that size actually was, I lived with that same sense of shame, a feeling I experienced physically, as a tension in my chest. (It can’t have helped that I walked around with my stomach sucked in, which meant that I rarely drew full breaths.) No one single thing has happened to take away this feeling. I’m yet to have an epiphany about my body like the ones we read about from mothers (“it grew a life!”) or those who survive grave illnesses. But after the fasting incident two years ago, I started to question why I was still so obsessed with thinness. I followed “body positive” accounts on social media (the brilliant Jessamyn Stanley and Megan Jayne Crabbe among them) – but found their brand of self-love too difficult to put into practice on myself. I admired their stance but the fact was, I did not love my body, and found that my critical inner voice could not be corrected by force. Then I came across the idea of body neutrality, where your body is not something you either love or hate; you just accept it. It’s a theory that speaks to much of what Orbach has been writing about since the 1970s. “You have to ask yourself, who would I be if I wasn’t focused on my body the whole time? What is this preoccupation getting in the way of and what could I achieve without it?” she says.
And so, I have begun gently to question the effort I’d put into my obsession over the years. It wasn’t so much the health foods, calorie-counting apps or hours in the gym I began to resent; it was the brain space that body shame was taking up. From the moment of waking to the moment I closed my eyes at night, the idea that my body was wrong had reverberated through my mind like the vibrations from a struck gong. Self-loathing coated every decision I made, from the obvious – what I ate and wore; how I exercised – to the oblique. I’d felt, for instance, that I should not apply for certain jobs (and these were run-of-the-mill office jobs rather than fashion magazines) as my body would not allow me to fit in. In her 2010 book Bodies, Orbach points out that “eating problems and body distress now constitute an ordinary part of everyday life”. Women in particular – but increasingly men, too – accept displeasure (or worse) as their baseline emotion when it comes to their bodies. In 2019, the Mental Health Foundation found that almost a fifth (19%) of UK adults felt disgusted by their bodies, while more than one-third were anxious or depressed because of their body image.
The everyday nature of body dissatisfaction leads some people to dismiss the gravity of it, but, as Orbach writes, it now “constitute[s] a hidden public health emergency, showing up obliquely in the statistics on self-harm, obesity and anorexia – the most visible and obvious signs of a far-wider-ranging body unease.” Never having been diagnosed with an eating disorder, I can’t claim to understand the pain of feeling so deeply alienated from your body, but I understand “unease”. The basic tenets of body neutrality include being grateful for what your body can do: its strength in carrying you from A to B; its skill in keeping you alive. You aim to avoid conversations about food, weight and how your body does (or should) look. You wear clothes that feel good and allow you to move freely and joyfully. And you opt to engage in activities you find fun, rather than ones that promise to “transform” your body. It’s harder than it sounds. Personally, I try not to think about it – a small act of resistance in a world that constantly tells us our bodies need to be refined, reworked, tweaked or transformed. Obviously, 30 years of discomfort cannot be undone in a few months. This chimera of emotions that rears up whenever I think about the way I look, or the size of my clothes, cannot be killed by logic alone. But I am going to keep trying; to accept that I, a very average woman, am absolutely fine as I am.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/ditching-the-diet-how-i-learned-to-accept-the-body-i-have
6112;6112;Flashback – Anastacia: ‘Men would say I looked like a sexy librarian, which was gross’;2022-01-01T12:00:01Z;['Harriet Gibsone'];['Life and style', 'Photography', 'Music'];"Born in Chicago in 1968 and raised in New York, Anastacia Lyn Newkirk is the multiplatinum star known for her mezzo-soprano voice. Anastacia became one of the best-selling female singers of the early noughties with her debut album Not That Kind – featuring the career-defining I’m Outta Love. She went on to release six more albums and had No 1 hits in more than 20 countries. She was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time in 2013, 10 years after the first, and has the heart condition supraventricular tachycardia. Her 20th anniversary tour, I’m Outta Lockdown, arrives in the UK in autumn 2022. This was taken in 2000, and I’m almost positive I was in France, promoting something. Looking at it now, I see a little cherub face and a girl who did her own hair and bought her own clothes. In my head I looked really fancy in my shrug, princess fur and T-shirt. And those white pants! I thought white was the colour of fancy people. I didn’t get signed to a label for a long time because I didn’t fit in. It was the era of Britney and Christina and there was nobody to model myself on. In the end, not fitting in was also the thing that got me signed. My A&R guy embraced who I was and understood how to bring out the best in me in terms of the way I liked to look and sound. It was a journey getting there, though. When I was trying to get a deal, people would say, “Can you sound more like Celine?” I tried. I even tried to sound like Mariah, but couldn’t hit her high notes.
I looked different, too – I wore glasses. Men who were trying to pick me up would say stuff like: “Oh – you look like a sexy librarian!” which I thought was gross. With a tint in the lenses, though, I felt cooler. Photographers would say: “You need to take them off” and I said: “If I take them off, I literally can’t see you. The whole world looks like it’s covered in Vaseline.” So I always kept them on. If you don’t stand up for yourself, nobody else is going to. Because my career took off in Europe first, I never felt that sense of validation, as if I’d proved everyone wrong. Every time I’d come back home, I would just be a person walking down the street. I’d arrive at the airport and be like, hey, where’s my car? There were no bodyguards with me the minute I got off the plane. One of the most delicious moments of my career happened in New York, though. Elton John is my total idol and we were introduced in 2000. He told me he was filming a show at Madison Square Garden and asked me if I’d duet Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting. At the end of the song, he got down on his knee and kissed my belly button. I was like, “Wait, what am I supposed to do here? He’s a Sir.” I ran off stage when the song was over and screamed backstage. Did that just happen? Did I sit on a piano stool with Sir Elton John and jam out? When I was 12, I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. It frightened me as I’d never had a boyfriend and I thought: Oh my god, I have a scar [from a stomach operation] and no one’s going to want to get close to me, because it’s just not a pretty disease. There were a few interesting guys who would say: “Oh is that a caesarean?” I’d be like: “Yeah! It was a sideways baby.” But over time, I got used to the scar and started showing my abs. I ended up embracing my body so much that I went full monty, wearing the bare minimum of what I was allowed to show on screen, basically from the ribcage down. It became a talking point. I didn’t care when male presenters made references about my body, as I never felt they were more powerful than me. I totally didn’t feel objectified. I was like – my boobs are freaking amazing and they’re huge! But you touch them? Then you have a problem. Guys goggle and ogle all the time. That was [American broadcaster] Howard Stern’s character. He is very sexual as a person on his show, but in reality he is such a nice guy. And Jonathan Ross was the same. You get him on camera for his talkshow and he turns into a character, it’s something for the boys. Plus, it’s hard to forget that they’re there when I displayed them like that. Of course, those guys should probably have the decorum not to mention it, but I never saw myself as being invaded in any way. If I hadn’t gone for a breast reduction in 2003 I wouldn’t have found out about my cancer until much later, but it was barely in its first stage. Plastic surgeons don’t ask for a mammogram, they normally just go in and do their job, but mine did. I was lucky, but the diagnosis was shocking, and my career was at one of its highest points. My first thought was: wow, is this how I’m going to die? I thought I’d go in a plane crash. I never stopped writing during treatment. But when I started radiation, it made me tired, forgetful and lifeless. It was torturous when I’d have an idea and it would leave my brain before I had time to get it down.
The second time [in 2013], I had a double mastectomy, which was really tough for me to bounce back from. Doctors removed muscles from my back to rebuild my breasts, so certain postures are difficult, and I have terrible neck issues. Rather than dwell on it, I’ve decided my job is to pass on a message to other people: don’t freak out, go get mammograms earlier than the doctor says. Go check out that thing you’re worried about so that we can have you around longer. I don’t think any woman really thinks their body is the best thing in the world. There’s always stuff you want to change. But as I’m getting older, I understand there’s nothing I can do to stop the ageing process. It’s tough for women – the 50s were bad with all the bullet bras and strapping yourself into corsets – but nowadays with all these filters on social media, I think it’s even worse. At the same time, I see the really young generation coming out with so much confidence and diversity: “I’m they/them and I have green hair – accept it”! And they’re 12. It’s exciting – we need those kinds of rock stars out there. I don’t even know how many surgeries I’ve had in my life. But every time I’ve gone through crap, instead of feeling like it’s an obstacle, I see it as a detour. You may have a longer road to get to where you want to be, but trust in the universe and have faith that it’ll lead to something great. Find hope in a terrible situation and just keep going.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/anastacia-men-would-say-i-look-like-sexy-librarian-gross
6113;6113;The UK city taking a stand on palm oil in the fight against deforestation;2022-01-01T11:15:00Z;['Patrick Greenfield'];['Palm oil', 'Endangered species', 'Deforestation', 'Food', 'Wildlife', 'Environment', 'Conservation', 'Animals', 'Trees and forests', 'World news', 'Cop26', 'Biodiversity'];"From mince pies and biscuits to lipstick and soap, palm oil grown on deforested land in south-east Asia will have been hard to avoid this Christmas. The vegetable oil is found in almost half of all packaged products in UK supermarkets, according to WWF. But a growing number of towns and cities are trying to use only sustainable palm oil, helping orangutans, tigers, Sumatran rhinos and many other threatened species.
Led by Chester in north-west England, the world’s first sustainable palm oil city, restaurants, small businesses and arts venues are joining forces to eradicate deforestation-linked forms of the vegetable oil from their supply chains. A school dinner provider in Chester has even signed up, the first to be certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Oxford, Plymouth and the village of Mochdre in north Wales are following Chester’s lead, with more expected to follow. “The palm oil situation is a big problem,” says Catherine Barton, a field conservation manager at Chester zoo, who has led the sustainable city campaign after a visit to Malaysian Borneo. “Populations of forest elephants and orangutans are separated by plantations. You get human-wildlife conflict when they move into those areas. It was from working with communities that we thought as users [of palm oil], we can try to change the industry.”
The UK is a small consumer of mainly sustainable palm oil. Globally, most palm oil is produced in Indonesia and Malaysia and is not sustainably certified by the RSPO. While companies such as Iceland have stopped using palm oil, Barton says an outright ban isnot the answer and making sustainable palm oil the default ingredient in products, from baby formula to shampoo, would have a much bigger impact on conservation, while supporting communities that rely on the palm fruit crop. Chester zoo has helped businesses such as a small Welsh fudge producer and an animal food provider to review and adapt their supply chains with the goal of removing all products containing non-RSPO certified palm oil.
“If you go palm oil free in the UK, you’re not going to have an impact on orangutans or influence the industry,” says Barton. “So, as an NGO, we feel that we have to be part of that conversation. And we use the UK and Europe as that influencer to change the industry rather than remove ourselves from it.” Barton emphasises that palm oil is a far more productive crop than alternatives such as rapeseed or maize. Large areas of Indonesia and Malaysia have been deforested for palm oil plantations, including carbon-dense peatlands that have been drained and burned, causing enormous greenhouse gas emissions. At Cop26 in Glasgow, world leaders pledged to halt and reverse deforestation and degradation by 2030. Greening global supply chains will be key to achieving that goal. To help protect standing forests, RSPO certification accredits producers and consumers of sustainable palm oil. The UK government is consulting on plans to ban large companies from using products grown on illegally deforested land.
Jason Ellison, proprietor of a French restaurant, Chez Jules, was among the first businesses to sign up to the campaign in Chester. He says reviewing his supply chain meant searching for palm oil in unusual places.
“I’m not a scientist. The zoo was very helpful. They gave us a list of all the places where you’d find palm oil – in bread, cake mixes, baking products … We use digestive biscuits as a base for one of our desserts, for example. That’s where we were zooming in.” Ian McGrady, managing director of Edsential, a social enterprise that provides school dinners in Chester, says becoming the first RSPO-certified school food provider in England has helped teach children about where their food comes from. “What we want to do is link the school meal to field conservation, so children get to see that if they make a decision, they can make a difference on the ground. Cost tends to trump any kind of ethical sourcing, even within schools,” he says. “We worked with main suppliers to see where they were in terms of palm oil and certification. It absolutely can be done.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/01/chester-new-approach-palm-oil-problem-aoe
6114;6114;Everton sign Dynamo Kyiv defender Vitaliy Mykolenko on four-year deal;2022-01-01T11:05:12Z;['Andy Martin'];['Everton', 'Transfer window', 'Football', 'Dynamo Kyiv', 'Sport'];"Everton have confirmed the signing of the Dynamo Kyiv defender Vitaliy Mykolenko for an undisclosed fee, with the Ukraine international agreeing a four-and-a-half-year deal. The left-back has won 21 caps for Ukraine and was a key part of the team that reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2020.
Mykolenko said: “Moving to Everton is a big and important step in my life. I am 22 but I don’t feel like a youngster. I have experience of playing at European level and hope I will continue to improve as a player.” Mykolenko can also operate in central defence and as a wing-back and made his Dynamo debut aged 18, making his senior international debut a year later. He added: “I like to play on the front foot and get forward when I can. Modern football demands that full-backs are able to attack as well as defend. I think I am a versatile defender who can get up and down the pitch. But I believe desire and commitment are the most important attributes and I will aim to bring those qualities.” Mykolenko is expected to replace Lucas Digne, who has fallen out of favour with Raphael Benítez in recent weeks and has been strongly linked with Brighton and Chelsea. Meanwhile, Benítez has likened Dominic Calvert-Lewin to a new signing as the striker prepares to make his first appearance since August. The England international scored in the first three matches of the season, but a thigh injury and subsequent setback in his recovery has denied Everton his services until now. There will be a temptation, especially with Richarlison still sidelined by a calf problem, to put Calvert-Lewin in from the start at home to Brighton on Sunday. However, while Benítez is delighted to have last season’s leading scorer back, he has sounded a note of caution about placing too much expectation on him. “He’s a massive signing for us in the second part of the league,” he said. “If we bring him back and, a few weeks later, Richarlison, we have more options there, we can think of the second part totally different. I’ve explained before that one thing is match fitness that you can improve by playing games and the other thing is fitness.
“Fitness-wise he is getting better. Match fitness, we will see. Maybe he scores three goals in the first half and we don’t need to worry about his match fitness, but I think the issue will be how long he can play if he starts the game or, if he comes from the bench, how much impact he can have on the game. “We are considering all of these things but he is training really well and he is really happy because he is with the team and is ready to play and score goals.”";https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/01/everton-sign-dynamo-kyiv-defender-vitaliy-mykolenko-on-four-year-deal
6115;6115;100 ways to slightly improve your life without really trying;2022-01-01T11:00:03Z;['N/A'];['Life and style', 'Health & wellbeing', 'Environment', 'Fashion', 'Books', 'Food'];"1 Exercise on a Monday night (nothing fun happens on a Monday night). 2 On the fence about a purchase? Wait 72 hours before you buy it. 3 Tip: the quickest supermarket queue is always behind the fullest trolley (greeting, paying and packing take longer than you think). 4 Bring fruit to work. Bring fruit to bed! 5 Consider going down to four days a week. It’s likely a disproportionate amount of your fifth day’s work is taxed anyway, so you’ll lose way less than a fifth of your take-home pay. 6 Everyone has an emotional blind spot when they fight. Work out what yours is, and remember it. 7 Plant spring bulbs, even if they’re just in a pot. 8 Send a voice note instead of a text; they sound like personal mini podcasts. 9 Keep a bird feeder by a window, ideally the kitchen. It’ll pass the time when you’re washing up. 10 Always bring ice to house parties (there’s never enough). 11 Get the lighting right: turn off the overhead one, turn on lots of lamps (but turn off when you leave the room). 12 Sharpen your knives. 13 Feeling sluggish at work? Try the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes on, five-minute break, and repeat. 14 Buy a cheap blender and use it to finely chop onions (it saves on time and tears).
15 Keep your children’s drawings and paintings. Put the best ones in frames. 16 Set aside 10 minutes a day to do something you really enjoy – be it reading a book or playing Halo. 17 Don’t be weird about how to stack the dishwasher. 18 Reuse all plastic bags – even bread bags. Much of the packaging you can’t reuse can be taken to larger branches of supermarkets for recycling. 19 Take a photo of the tag you are given when leaving your coat in a cloakroom. 20 Can’t sleep? Try a relaxing soak with lavender bath oil before bed. 21 Add the milk at least one minute after the tea has brewed. 22 Laugh shamelessly at your own jokes. 23 It might sound obvious, but a pint of water before bed after a big night avoids a clanger of a hanger. 24 Start a Saturday morning with some classical music – it sets the tone for a calm weekend. 25 Look closely. 26 Set time limits for your apps. Just go to the settings on your smartphone and add a limit – for example, if you have an iPhone turn on Screen Time. 27 If possible, take the stairs. 28 Always be willing to miss the next train. 29 Eat meat once a week, max. Ideally less. 30 Be polite to rude strangers – it’s oddly thrilling. 31 Ask questions, and listen to the answers. 32 Connect with nature: stand outside barefoot for a few minutes – even when it’s cold. 33 Join your local library – and use it. Find yours here. 34 Go for a walk without your phone. 35 Eat salted butter (life’s too short for unsalted). 36 Stretch in the morning. And maybe in the evening. 37 If you’re going less than a mile, walk or cycle. About half of car journeys are under two miles, yet these create more pollution than longer journeys as the engine isn’t warmed up yet. 38 Sleep with your phone in a different room (and buy an alarm clock). 39 Send postcards from your holidays. Send them even if you’re not on holiday. 40 Instead of buying new shoes, get old ones resoled and buy new laces. 41 Buy a plant. Think you’ll kill it? Buy a fake one.
42 Don’t have Twitter on your phone. 43 If you find an item of clothing you love and are certain you will wear for ever, buy three. 44 Try taking a cold shower (30 seconds to two minutes) before your hot one. It’s good for your health – both physical and mental. 45 Text to say thank you. 46 Read a poem every day. Keep a compendium, such as A Poem for Every Day of the Year, by your bed. 47 Take out your headphones when walking – listen to the world. 48 Buy secondhand. 49 Buy in person! 50 Learn how to floss properly. 51 If something in the world is making you angry, write (politely) to your MP – they will read it. 52 Say hello to your neighbours. 53 Learn the basics of repairing your clothes.
54 Always bring something – wine, flowers – to a dinner/birthday party, even if they say not to. 55 Learn the names of 10 trees. 56 Call an old friend out of the blue. 57 Every so often, search your email for the word “unsubscribe” and then use it on as many as you can. 58 Buy a newspaper. (Ideally this one.) 59 Always have dessert. 60 Drop your shoulders. 61 Make something from scratch. Works best if it’s something you’d normally buy, such as a dress or a bag. 62 Go to bed earlier – but don’t take your phone with you. 63 Volunteer. Go to gov.uk/government/get-involved for ideas. 64 Dry your cutlery with a cloth (it keeps it shiny). 65 Instead of buying a morning coffee, set up a daily transfer of £2 from a current into a savings account and forget about it. Use it to treat yourself to something different later. 66 Don’t save things for “best”. Wear them – enjoy them. 67 Sing!
68 Think about your posture: don’t slouch, and don’t cross your legs. 69 Hang your clothes up. Ideally on non-wire hangers (it’s better for them). 70 Skinny-dip with friends. 71 Switch your phone off on holiday (or at least delete your work email app). 72 Always use freshly ground pepper. 73 Thank a teacher who changed your life. 74 Respect your youngers. 75 Keep your keys in the same place. 76 Ditch the plastic cartons and find a milkman – The Modern Milkman has a comprehensive list. 77 Rent rather than buy a suit/dress for that forthcoming wedding (even if it’s your own). 78 Always book an extra day off after a holiday. 79 Ignore the algorithm – listen to music outside your usual taste. 80 Mute or leave a WhatsApp group chat. 81 Learn a TikTok dance (but don’t post it on TikTok). 82 Cook something you’ve never attempted before. 83 Join a local litter-picking group. 84 Handwash that thing you’ve never cleaned. 85 Don’t get a pet/do get a pet. 86 Nap. 87 Learn how to breathe deeply: in through the nose, out through the mouth, making the exhale longer than the inhale. 88 Buy a bike and use it. Learn how to fix it, too. 89 Politely decline invitations if you don’t want to go. 90 If you do go, have an exit strategy (can we recommend a French exit, where you slip out unseen). 91 If in doubt, add cheese. 92 Don’t look at your phone at dinner. 93 Do that one thing you’ve been putting off. 94 Give compliments widely and freely. 95 Set up an affordable standing order to a charity. RNLI and Greenpeace spring to mind …
96 Keep a book in your bag to avoid the temptation to doomscroll. 97 Listen to the albums you loved as a teenager. 98 Make a friend from a different generation. 99 Staying over at a friend’s place? Strip the bed in the morning. 100 For instant cheer, wear yellow. • This article was inspired by a similar exercise in Weekend magazine in January 2000.

6116;6116;The endless pleasure of potted ivies | Alys Fowler;2022-01-01T11:00:03Z;['Alys Fowler'];['Gardening advice', 'Gardens', 'Life and style'];"I have a little outdoor table by the french windows that houses an ever-changing display of pot plants. In summer it has pomegranates, citrus and, towards the back, some ivies. In winter, when the lemons are indoors, I move the ivies to the foreground. Their curtain of leaves distracts from the real reason the table is there: to hide all the pots and seed trays underneath it. I don’t own a shed because I can’t bear to part with the space in the garden, so I am forever finding ways to squirrel away the unsightly parts of gardening. I am not generous to these ivies – they survive in 30cm pots. In spring and autumn I top them up with a little fresh compost, but that’s about it. And yet they thrive. Come winter, I dot pots of early-flowering bulbs between them – reticulata irises, miniature daffodils and snowdrops – so small hints of spring bring a little cheer.
Ivies can spread and climb great distances, but there are many varieties suited to life in cramped, hard conditions, whether that’s a north-facing window box, a sliver of soil along a side return, a shady basement courtyard or an unheated porch. Just don’t try to keep them indoors: ivies are often touted as good houseplants, but you’d need a very cold and damp house to keep them happy. That said, I have visited some very cold bathrooms where they might thrive.
On the whole, variegated forms are bred to be vigorous, so there are only a few that will do well in pots. The cream-and-yellow Hedera helix “Little Luzii” is compact and doesn’t spread or climb much. Its mid-green leaves are speckled and splashed with cream. Likewise, H. helix “Midas Touch”, with its heart-shaped leaves and white-and-gold variegation around the edge that turn a lovely pink with a little frost, is good at brightening a dull corner.
There are numerous pretty deep-green types – my tabletop variety is H. helix “Koniger’s Auslese”, which has narrow, star-shaped leaves that look good against a painted wall. The same goes for “Ivalace” or “Parsley Crested”, which have crinkled, glossy leaves and do well even in deep shade. The miniature-leaved “Duckfoot”, with its wedge-shape light-green leaves will fill out a pot quickly, which makes it particularly good for hanging baskets. Fibrex Nursery and the Plantsman’s Preference both have an extensive collection. Ivies are not particularly fussy about soils, but do better in slightly alkaline soils, and thrive in composts with good water-holding capacity. This can be achieved by adding composted bark to peat-free compost. Finally, do allow the plants to dry out between watering. A dry plant can make a miraculous recovery, but an overwatered one rots away quickly.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/the-endless-pleasure-of-potted-ivies
6117;6117;‘There are no bad kids. Just kids making bad choices’: the campaigner battling youth knife crime | Guardian angel;2022-01-01T11:00:02Z;['Sirin Kale'];['Life and style', 'Knife crime', 'Society', 'Young people'];"If you made a film of Mark Bracewell’s life, audiences would probably look on sceptically and think: “That’s a bit extreme.” Bracewell grew up on an estate in Moss Side, Manchester, in the 1980s. When he was 13, he watched members of a gang hack a man to death in a pub with a machete. The following year, his friend Benjamin was murdered in a takeaway. The killers were never found. Bracewell thinks it was probably a case of mistaken identity. He was with Benjamin on the day he died. He found out about his murder on the news. “We were kids,” says Bracewell, who is now 44 and lives in Stoke-on-Trent. “But we were living in a war zone.” He began breaking into cars and selling drugs for the older kids on the estate. “We were manipulated,” he says. “Today you’d call it county lines. Police wouldn’t stop kids.” He joined a gang when he was 13 and became addicted to cocaine four years later. “As I grew older,” he says, “my heart got tighter and smaller. When you’ve seen someone hacked to death with a machete, you grow numb. It was easier to brush everything under the carpet than deal with it. I took drugs as my way out of reality.” Aged 26, he robbed a taxi driver at knifepoint – he was high on cocaine at the time and needed money for drugs – and spent three years and nine months in prison. “It’s embarrassing,” says Bracewell, “but it’s part of my journey.” In 2010, he got out of prison, and started to rebuild his life. He worked as a bar manager but still occasionally used drugs, despite his best efforts to quit. Then, on New Year’s Eve 2016, he got involved in a nightclub fight. “I saw the knife coming towards me,” Bracewell says. “And that was the last thing I ever saw out of that eye. Instantly I knew I was blind in my left eye.” The stabbing was a turning point. As Bracewell was taken to hospital, he cried out to God. “I said,” he remembers, “‘I don’t want to die.’ And I heard God say, ‘You won’t die. I need you to see.’”
After his release from prison, Bracewell moved to Stoke, where he was supported by a Christian charity called Walk Ministries, which works with ex-offenders. “I was at a crossroads in my life,” he says, “and I knew I didn’t want to continue doing what I was doing.” The experience reawakened Bracewell’s dormant faith. “I was a Christian growing up,” he says, “but I never followed it.” Now he is committed. At Bracewell’s request, Walk Ministries got him a placement doing youth volunteer work, and he became an anti-knife crime campaigner. He sees a certain symmetry in his new line of work. “The crime I went to prison for involved a knife,” he says, “and I was stabbed with a knife. God is using me as a tool.”
He goes into secondary schools to speak about his life, and the mistakes he made. “You get a few kids,” says Bracewell, “who think they know it all, and talk all the way through.” Bracewell has an unorthodox way of grabbing their attention: “I walk up to them,” he chuckles, “and pop my glass eye out, so they get a shock.” That usually quietens them down. The message of these speeches is a serious one. He talks about the statistics of knife crime, and walks them through the consequences of his own mistakes. “I tell them that every decision has a consequence,” Bracewell says. “What do you want that consequence to be?” In the past week, he tells me, he’s spoken to over 4,000 children in just four days, and is absolutely knackered. “It definitely connected with the kids,” says Marc Inchley, who recently invited Bracewell into his further education college. “They sat up and listened to him. Not all the speakers we get in have that impact. He’s doing this for the right reasons.” Bracewell also cofounded an organisation called Blinded Faith, which works with local authorities to mentor at-risk children. He does one-to-one sessions with children who are vulnerable to knife crime. “I can’t get anywhere without building trust,” he says. “If I say to the kids, ‘I’ll be there’ and something happens to them, I have to come through. If they don’t trust me, they won’t give anything back.” When the kids run away from home, or get arrested, Bracewell is often the person they call. He’s driven to Leeds and Wales in the early hours of the morning to collect them. “There are no bad kids,” he says. “Just kids who are making bad choices.”
With all his talks at schools, or driving to meet with his mentees, Bracewell spends a lot of time away from his wife and baby. “That’s the hardest thing,” he says. So for his treat, he asked for a night out in London with his wife Kelisha and son Zion. He loves architecture and she loves food. The Ting Shangri-La restaurant in the Shard skyscraper near London Bridge offered to host the family – but it’s on the 35th floor, and Bracewell is afraid of heights. “It’s all about conquering those fears,” he laughs. They spent quality time together for the first time in weeks. “I can only do what I do with my wife by my side,” says Bracewell. “So it was for both of us.” He particularly enjoyed seeing his baby in the Shard, looking down on the world below from on high – “that was amazing”.

6118;6118;‘Everyone came at once’: America’s national parks reckon with record-smashing year;2022-01-01T11:00:01Z;['Annette McGivney'];['National parks', 'Travel and transport', 'US news'];"After more than a year of Covid cabin fever, the landscapes of the west called out to cooped up Americans, who arrived in greater numbers than ever before. As a result, 2021 saw bucket-list parks – including Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Zion, Arches, Canyonlands and Glacier – smash their previous visitation records. But the mass exodus into the outdoors has come at a cost. The 1960s-era wastewater system in Yellowstone was pushed to the brink. Arches temporarily closed 120 times because all the parking lots were full. The Grand Canyon struggled to cope with a record number of rescues, and an influx of remote workers have driven rents sky high in gateway towns such as Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Interviews with park supervisors, staff and guests paint a picture of a system under increasing strain and struggling to adapt to this new reality. National parks have become the go-to destination for vacationers craving dazzling sights at a social distance, but the surge has collided with a host of existing problems on public lands, including years of underinvestment. That has left staff overwhelmed and guests frustrated.
“The whole country had been pent up and everybody decided to come to the American west at the same time,” says Jason Williams, chair of the Jackson Hole chamber of commerce and owner of a wildlife tour company. “Last summer people were rolling into town without reservations or a plan but they had very high expectations.” Now that the chaotic tourism season is over, park superintendents are taking a deep breath and examining how Covid has changed America’s relationship to the outdoors. The record turnout has been a phenomenon largely affecting parks in the western US, and marks a shift from 2020, where people were more likely to visit parks closer to home. That changed when the relaxing of Covid restrictions made wild, celebrated landscapes more accessible, and park authorities say that will continue. For Chip Jenkins, the superintendent of Grand Teton, which saw a record 3.8 million visitors in 2021, that means balancing the benefits of more people heading outdoors with the logistical challenges of accommodating them. “I am thinking about what this means for 2022 but also for 2042,” says Jenkins. “How are we going to preserve a high-quality visitor experience?” It’s not Disneyland: park staff strained by larger crowds Inspired by well-funded state tourism campaigns and an endless feed of beautiful photos on Instagram, Americans headed to crown jewel parks expecting a picture-postcard experience. But the upbeat marketing pitches glossed over the fact that Covid coincided with a period of chronic underfunding.
According to the not-for-profit National Parks Conservation Association, National Park Service staff has shrunk by 14% over the last decade, primarily due to federal funding cuts. Total visitation to all national park properties has increased by 20% during the same period. Making the situation even more difficult were staff housing restrictions and supply chain problems created by Covid. While visitors would find the Tetons or Delicate Arch as spectacular as ever, they would also discover there were not enough park employees to shoulder the increased demand for basic services like cleaning bathrooms or answering questions at visitor centers. Tourists in gateway towns also encountered closed restaurants due to lack of staffing, empty store shelves caused by supply chain problems, hotels that were booked out for months, traffic jams and frazzled local residents.
In Yellowstone – where visitation hit 4.4 million in 2021, a million more than in 2020 – the sudden influx created a kind of operational whiplash. “Historically, we had 20 years between each additional million visitors and there was plenty of time to adjust,” says Cam Sholly, Yellowstone’s superintendent. “But getting that increase in just a 12-month period made it hard to react fast enough.” Sholly says the primary impact of last year’s visitor increase was the extra stress placed on park infrastructure and staff rather than on the wild landscape. “All of a sudden we are having to clean the bathrooms five times a day instead of three,” he says. “And we are needing to empty 2,000 trash cans more often.” Supply chain problems caused food to run low at even the most highbrow Yellowstone restaurants and hotels. And staffing shortages often left dining rooms without enough servers. Chris Schultz and his wife visited the park’s Old Faithful Inn in late September. Given the hotel’s historic reputation and $500-a-night price tag, they had high expectations but came away disappointed. “The only thing you could get for breakfast was a cold bagel that was being served out of a cooler,” says Schultz, who lives in Tennessee. Yellowstone visitor activity traditionally tapers off in the fall when snow arrives, but last year the park set a September visitation record of more than 9,000 people. Park managers say attractions like Old Faithful and Mammoth Hot Springs are now just as packed in the fall as they are during summer.
“Yellowstone reached the point several years ago where there are more visitors inside the park than there are services to accommodate them,” says Mike Keller, general manager for Yellowstone National Park Lodges. But Keller, who has worked at Yellowstone for 30 years, does not think adding more hotel rooms or camp grounds is going to solve the problem. He is more interested in educating new park visitors about how Yellowstone’s rustic atmosphere is very different from places like Disneyland – and he wants it to stay that way. “I saw more visitors come to Yellowstone who were unprepared for what the park experience is like,” he says. “We have never had TVs or swimming pools in our hotels. But there were so many times when guests would complain about it to our employees, saying they didn’t know what to do with their family at night. There was a real fatigue for staff caused by visitors wanting services that we don’t offer.” Danger for visitors who are ‘underestimating the challenges’ Park staff say a lack of preparedness, particularly among newcomers who may underestimate the extremes of these wild places, has driven up search and rescue costs and monopolized ranger time. In Grand Canyon national park, the strain of backcountry rescues has become especially acute. Though visitation decreased in 2021 due to a drop in international tourism, park rescues increased by 30% compared with the annual average. The park carried out at least 400 backcountry evacuations in 2021, the most in 20 years. The park informs people about the challenges of hiking in the canyon, where temperatures routinely climb into the triple digits and trails are relentlessly steep, but Grand Canyon superintendent Ed Keable says many of last year’s first-time visitors to the park did not heed those warnings. “They were underestimating the challenge and overestimating their physical abilities,” says Keable. “They were just so eager to get out and hike but they were not as fit as they had been before the pandemic.”
While the rescue data from Grand Canyon and other parks show that the new visitors are often lacking in preparation or a sense of caution, they also share other characteristics, according to a recent study conducted by social scientists at the University of Montana, Penn State and the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics. The study surveyed nearly 5,000 adults across the United States during May and June 2021 to find out who was recreating outdoors during Covid. The results revealed a fairly homogeneous group: people who are predominantly white, middle aged and have slightly higher than average disposable incomes. “It turns out the new outdoor recreationists are not very different demographically from the existing recreationists,” says Peter Newman, a co-author of the study and a professor with Penn State’s department of recreation, park and tourism management. The survey found that 76% of the outdoor recreation newcomers were white; 73% of people who had been going outdoors before Covid were white. Meanwhile, people who had been recreating outdoors but dropped that activity during Covid were predominantly people of color and lower income. These demographics mirror a longstanding lack of diversity among national park visitors. According to a 2015 National Park Service report, only 20% of domestic national park visitors were people of color despite the fact they make up 40% of the US population. “The new visitors going to parks during the pandemic were people who had fewer constraints economically and more flexibility related to work,” adds Rice. Squeezing out locals Remote working has played a large role in bringing more people into gateway communities that surround national parks. Outdoor recreationists and wealthy families fleeing cities during the pandemic for scenic rural communities have sent rents spiking in destinations such as Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which is just outside Grand Teton and is near Yellowstone.
Residents in Jackson Hole say that many of the houses in the 10,000 population town that had been rentals for service industry workers and ski bums have been bought to be torn down for new construction. The average price of a house in Jackson Hole is $2.5m, more than double what it was a decade ago, and rent for housing set aside for service industry workers over the summer started at $3,000 a month for a 400 sq ft apartment. The result is an inflated housing market that’s priced out longtime residents. “Tourism drives interest in Jackson Hole, and that interest drives real estate investment, which then raises the cost of living and changes the labor market entirely,” says Chris Dickey, who has lived in Jackson Hole for 17 years and owns a digital marketing agency. “People visit the area a few times and then decide they want to move here. There are plenty of people out there willing to pay $3m to $5m for a home in Jackson Hole, but the problem is that’s not a price locals can afford.”
Dickey has observed that many new residents in Jackson Hole come from urban centers like San Francisco and New York City. They are tech executives, finance industry professionals and successful entrepreneurs. Dickey acknowledges that park visitors are an essential part of the thriving Jackson Hole economy but all the attention can also pose an existential threat. “The real problem is not the crowds or traffic but the loss of our community because no one can afford to live here any more,” he says. “That is the true cost of tourism.” Park leaders are hopeful that a watershed of new federal funding set aside for parks will at least begin to tackle some of these challenges. Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill includes $1.7bn for roads, bridges and other improvements inside national parks, while a bill currently under consideration in Congress contains a proposed $2.93m for National Park Service operations that would facilitate hiring more than 1,000 additional Park Service rangers and other employees, as well as funding for diversity and inclusion programs. “The politicians in DC now know the public really loves these places and wants more investment in them,” says Kristen Brengel, senior vice-president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association. As for managing crowding, parks that experienced the most congestion during Covid are looking at ways to require online reservations before arriving. Arches national park is implementing a timed entry system, while Zion will soon require permits for its popular day hike to Angels Landing. Online entry reservations that were implemented during 2020 at Rocky Mountain and Yosemite national parks as Covid precautions will probably stay in place.
But national park advocates and managers worry that these systems could further alienate the people who are not visiting America’s crown jewels. “What park managers are doing to control impacts from increased visitation could make the parks less accessible to people of color or lower income,” says William Rice, a professor of outdoor recreation and wildland management at the University of Montana and a co-author of the study on Covid-era park visitation. Rice points out that problems with internet speeds, digital literacy and knowledge about new requirements can pose additional barriers for certain groups. For example, the primary National Park Service reservation site, Recreation.gov, is only in English. “Our research serves as a note of caution to land managers and the tourism community at large,” he says. “Covid had negative impacts on efforts to create a more inclusive outdoors. We need to figure out how to distribute our nation’s recreation resources more equitably.”

6119;6119;Young country diary: Now I know loads about bullfinches;2022-01-01T11:00:01Z;['N/A'];['Environment', 'Rural affairs', 'UK news', 'Birds', 'Animals', 'Wildlife'];The weekend before Christmas we were in a holiday cabin in the forest. We saw lots of birds. My brother and I fed them so we could get a good look. When we were getting ready to go home, my dad shouted: “Come upstairs, now!” We ran up to the bedroom. We looked out of the window, and in the fog stood a little bird! My brother found the bird book and flicked through it. “It’s a bullfinch!” he cried, and he was right. It was amazing! There were a lot of facts I learned. It’s only 15cm long – that’s half a ruler! These birds’ chests can be orange or pink. Sometimes they look like a robin or a chaffinch. The males have bright colours but the females have dull brown feathers. They feed voraciously on seeds, buds and insects. Their tune is a soft whistle noise. They are endangered so they need help. They breed in May to July and lay up to four or five eggs. They make their nest on the ground. It was amazing that on a cold winter day one was hopping about in front of my eyes. Seeing the bullfinch made my holiday.

The rising cost of living and the uncertainty over the pandemic are just two of the challenges that people are having to deal with, so what are some of the things that individuals are planning to do differently this year? ‘I’m hoping to support my activism through Patreon’ Natalie Evans’s financial goal relates to 2020, when her life changed after she filmed a racist incident on a train. The video went viral and Natalie, 32, and her sister Naomi ended up setting up the Instagram account Everyday Racism to help educate people about the issue, teach them how to become anti-racist and offer resources they have created. After accruing 190,000 followers, it has become such a huge platform that last month Natalie quit her job at a youth charity, while Naomi went down to three days a week in her role as a teacher to focus on the account. To help her survive financially, Natalie’s focus for 2022 is to attract people to their newly set-up Patreon account, where people can donate to support their work on Instagram. Patreon is an online platform used by musicians, artists and others where people can fund someone’s creative work via monthly membership.

I wasn’t sure but it takes time to write up resources and do the things we want to do, and we need support,” Natalie says. “It’s a great way of having a safety net.” The Patreon platform will enable the sisters to create more exclusive content. “It would be great if there was enough of an income from it for me, and then potentially for Naomi for the two days she’s working for Everyday Racism,” she says. Their Patreon membership has various tiers of access with different prices. Those signing up for the £3 a month tier receive a monthly newsletter plus resources, while a £10 subscription gives supporters access to a monthly Zoom Q&A focused on different topics. There are guest speakers and the chance to ask questions about anti-racism work and discuss current affairs with the sisters. As a result of quitting her job, Natalie says that another goal is to rein in her spending this year. “I’ve gone from a full-time wage to being freelance, so I need to cut down as much as I can in terms of personal spending. I’ll be cutting down on things like buying new clothes, meeting people for coffee, eating out and other subscription services.” ‘I’m going to give away 10% of my income’ Martin Hall, 25, has made a big commitment for 2022 – and beyond. The data engineer from Manchester has signed up to give away 10% of his income to charities for the rest of his working life. Hall has joined Giving What We Can, an organisation that encourages members to give 10% or more of their income to charities that have been found to have the most impact. It offers information to help members choose causes and organisations to donate to, and provides a list of charities it says are effective. A calculator on the site shows you how much impact your 10% donation could have. Everyone who has made the pledge – including Hall – is listed on the site, to encourage other people to add their name.
“I’ve understood the arguments to do this for a while but now I feel like I’m at the point where I can commit,” says Hall, who will organise the payments directly from his bank account. “It feels like the right thing to do. I am fairly comfortable and my needs are met, so 10% doesn’t make much difference – a nicer car or more takeaways doesn’t make much difference to me, whereas the money could have a huge impact on someone else’s life. I’ll stick to the pledge through continued belief in the value of what I’m doing, budgeting, and having a wider community around me that have taken the same pledge.” Hall has picked six organisations – which he can change later – including the Global Health and Development Fund and GiveDirectly, a non-profit organisation that allows donors to send money directly to people in poverty with no strings attached. “It’s a nice balance of global health and development but also long-term solutions to reduce global catastrophes such as reducing the risk of human extinction,” he says. What did friends and family think of his pledge? “My parents said it was a good idea. But for me, it’s primarily a thing you do for yourself and decide on your own.” Giving What We Can is part of the Centre for Effective Altruism, a charity. ‘I’m going to manage my finances better and scale back spending’ After recently switching from being a sole trader to setting up a limited company and hiring her first employee, Leila Hrycyszyn, 32, says that this year she plans to be more rigorous with her finances and set aside money for her tax bill.
“I’m usually frantically saving for my tax bill at the end of the year,” says the owner of a PR agency. “I often find I’ve spent most of the tax bill rather than putting money aside throughout the year. I need to manage my finances a lot better, so at the start of 2022 I’m planning to pay myself a salary and then put the rest in savings accounts for the tax bill. I know I need to deposit money into different accounts as, at the moment, everything goes out of the current account.” Hrycyszyn, who lives in Alton, Hampshire, says she has been focused on spending rather than saving during the past few months. “I plan to cut back and put some real plans in place, like monthly goals to stop my spending,” she says. To help her cut back, she plans to track her spending on a finance and spending calendar. “This will make me more mindful about what I’m buying and make me think twice about purchasing things in one click online.” She adds: “I’ll be thinking about whether it’s really an essential purchase or not, and if not, won’t buy it. I spend quite a lot on platforms like Asos’s Premier Delivery, and Amazon Prime. I need to stop thinking I need six different things today. I’m going to cut back as much as I can. I’ll be looking at subscriptions and whether I need them. I don’t think I’ll stop using Amazon – I find it incredibly useful but what I have done is removed the app from my homepage.” Looking ahead, she is feeling positive. “Marketing budgets have kicked off again and I’m the busiest I’ve ever been,” she says. “Even if there’s another lockdown, I don’t feel like budgets would go again like they did last time. I’m hoping the business will continue to thrive.” ‘I’m looking to focus more on using cash’ Tristan Verran, 49, a performer and educator living in Plymouth, wants to spend 2022 exploring alternative ways of transacting. For him, this means going against the cashless trajectory and paying more with notes and coins. “I like cash,” he says. “There’s no privacy issues. It’s not really traceable, there’s more anonymity with it, and it’s not micromanaged by some unseen AI somewhere.” “Although spending cash might be tough as more places are turning card-only, especially after the pandemic. I’m an academic and I deal with books but this is a social project I’d like to do. I know little in the way of finance but all I know is that it’s become clear that the global finance system is incapable of meeting the material needs of the majority and is instead committed to systemically transferring wealth upwards.”
Verran is keen to explore negotiation and exchanging services, and see who is willing to participate. “I’m definitely going to step up and be more vigilant, and look at where things come from, and shop local more,” he says, adding: “I’ve started bartering. I taught someone’s kids in exchange for their parent sorting out the plumbing.” He says he would also like to look into creating a local version of the Bristol pound, the city currency that is in the process of transforming into a new scheme called Bristol Pay. “That model has been interesting. I’ve already started putting feelers out about creating something similar in Plymouth,” he says. “I want to invest in communities, not extracting wealth and giving it to some unseen billionaire to build spaceships. I’d like to push for that kind of model in Cornwall and possibly Devon. I just think what is happening right now isn’t working – we need different ways of doing stuff and exchanging services. We need more community engagement.” Verran hopes to knock £10,000 from his £27,000 student loan debt in the first six months of the year. “This is optimistic to manageable as I am seriously curtailing my weekly expenses on food and travel,” he says. “I will be baking more, and all bills are included in my studio, so I know exactly how much my monthly spend will be. However, [any] lockdowns are going to mean that I rely more heavily on online teaching. I will still be required to complete teaching courses online, so that money is guaranteed, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find new teaching work, or even venues to perform live. I’ll be performing outside with rural sites for free, regardless of lockdowns, and hoping to get some donations from patrons.” Verran expects to pay off about £1,500 to £2,000 a month from his student loans. ‘I’m setting up a green and ethical pension’ A committed environmentalist, Alexis Bushnell, 33, is on a mission to make her finances green. After moving from northern France to St Athan, south of Cardiff, last year, Bushnell needed to open a bank account but, rather than choose one of the traditional high street banks, she opted to open one with Monzo. “The big banks are known for not being green, so I opened a business account with Monzo, but in 2022 I plan to open a savings account with Triodos Bank and spread my money between the two,” she says. “I like the fact that Triodos’s website is very upfront about the fact they care about people and the planet, and they’re clear about who they invest with.”
Bushnell’s goal is to invest in a pension for the first time. “It’s incredibly difficult to live off a state pension, so it would be nice to have something to top it up with, so I know I’m not going to be working until I die. I don’t want to reach my late 50s and realise I don’t have any way to support myself outside the state pension.” Adhering to her strong principles, Bushnell is going to scout out an ethical pension provider to help her save for retirement. She says she will be seeking advice via Facebook groups for ethical business owners, and asking on Twitter and LinkedIn for recommendations from people who already have ethical pensions. “I’m looking for a pension provider that doesn’t invest in fossil fuels or things I’m morally opposed to, and isn’t helping to destroy the planet,” says Bushnell, whose company offers social media services. “I’m vegan, I buy from zero-waste shops, I don’t drive … I try to do everything from a personal level, which has a limited impact, but where I invest my money makes a bigger impact. Money talks.”";https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/01/new-year-resolutions-income-money-saving-charity
6121;6121;Young country diary: Ham sandwiches for lunch, ammonites for afters;2022-01-01T11:00:00Z;['N/A'];['Environment', 'Rural affairs', 'UK news', 'Fossils', 'Science'];"The sun has risen from its slumber, its light reflecting on the still water. I go outside, attacked by the icy winds blowing hard. I retreat into my home to fetch my coat. December days are the coldest of all. I pass the hours skimming stones and making fires – watching the flames dance always helps me relax. I watch as my brothers play with the rocks, seeing how far they can throw. I join them, throwing stones until my arm becomes sore. Lunch now. My stomach growls as my mum hands me my food. I sit outside, watching the waves of the Channel, eating my ham sandwich and drinking a juice box. After, I go for a walk, climbing over big rocks and exploring caves. I look at the cliffs, searching for treasure. But what’s this? I see small shells embedded into the rocks.
I pick at the shells, prying seven from the cliff. Ammonites, I tell myself, recognising the twisted shape. Fossils as old as the dinosaurs. I turn towards the sea. I think of the shells floating in the water, not rocks, but alive. I put an image in my head of them drifting in the ever-blue, tiny tentacles limp and lifeless, like in the books. I put them in my pocket and set off for home. The sun sets as I reach my house, the stars shimmering above my head like little lights in the dark sky.

6122;6122;From Assal to Zemura: 10 young Football League talents to watch in 2022;2022-01-01T11:00:00Z;['Ben Fisher'];['Football', 'Championship', 'League One', 'Sport'];"1) Brennan Johnson, 20, Nottingham Forest At times it is hard to remember that this is the electric winger’s first true taste of the Championship. Johnson, the son of the former Forest striker David, has lit up games with direct bursts forward, providing five assists and five goals this season, the first an equaliser at local rivals Derby. Johnson scored an 11-minute hat-trick on loan at Lincoln in League One last season and is primed to play a part in Wales’s play-off quest to reach Qatar 2022. He is not short of top-flight admirers but Forest are determined to keep the academy graduate. 2) Isaiah Jones, 22, Middlesbrough It has been an incredible rise from eighth-tier Tooting & Mitcham United, where West Ham’s Michail Antonio started his career, to Middlesbrough, for whom he made his league debut in August after returning from a productive loan at Queen of the South. Jones, who once trialled at Charlton, bypassed the under-23s at Tooting to become a non-league regular at 18. At his best driving forward, he has developed the defensive side of his game playing as a right wing-back for Boro. Wanted on loan by League Two clubs in the summer, he is now at the heart of Boro’s push for the Premier League.
3) Keane Lewis-Potter, 20, Hull City Locals no doubt knew they were witnessing someone a bit special when he finished one season with 128 goals for Hessle Rangers in the Hull & District Youth League. Lewis-Potter joined his hometown club at 14, played for the under-23s at 17 and last season scored 15 times as Hull were promoted to the Championship. A winger who likes to dance off the left flank, he is quick and composed. At a time when Jarrod Bowen is drawing praise in high places, Hull have another tricky winger destined for big things.
4) Jordan Zemura, 22, Bournemouth The defender has proven influential since impressing on his league debut in August in the Championship’s curtain-raiser, with Scott Parker entrusting him with being his first-choice left-back. This month Zemura, who spent three years at QPR, is set to represent Zimbabwe at the Africa Cup of Nations, three years on from working as a glass fitter after his release by Charlton. His biggest asset is surely his athleticism given the way he bounds up and down the flank. “It feels like my superpower,” he says. 5) Alex Scott, 18, Bristol City Socks rolled down towards his ankles, no wonder the midfielder has been labelled the “Guernsey Grealish”. “I try to model my game on him,” Scott says. He travelled from the Channel Islands to Southampton, who released him at 12, and then Bournemouth as a youngster but while at eighth-tier Guernsey FC, for whom he played regularly aged 16, he impressed Bristol City on a week’s trial, scoring a perfect hat-trick in an under-18s game. Made his Championship debut as a 17-year-old in April and he signed a new four-year contract in August, a month before his England Under-19s debut. 6) Ronnie Edwards, 18, Peterborough United Thrust into the heart of the Posh defence after promotion, the centre-back, who turned 18 in March, has admirably dealt with what Neil Warnock would term the “muck and nettles” of the Championship. Edwards, who signed from Barnet as a 17-year-old, impressed Darren Ferguson in pre-season and is developing all the time in a team fighting relegation, showing aggression and a touch of class, while the chairman, Darragh MacAnthony, has tipped him to reach the top flight. Made his England Under-19s debut in October.
7) Scott Twine, 22, MK Dons No player has more goal involvements in League One – 11 goals and seven assists across 21 games this season – and those numbers are even more impressive when considering he was on loan at sixth-tier Chippenham Town as recently as 2020. That summer a swerving strike for his hometown club, Swindon, in pre-season caught the eye of the then Newport manager, Michael Flynn, and the attacking midfielder has not looked back since. A specialist in the spectacular – long-range rockets and free-kicks are his forte – Twine, who wears the No 9 shirt at MK Dons, has added a poacher’s instinct to his palette. 8) James Hill, 19, Fleetwood Town Such is the centre-back’s burgeoning reputation, a Barcelona scout paid Fleetwood a visit in October to cast an eye over the teenager. Hill made his first-team debut aged 16 against Blackpool who, along with Bolton, released him as a youngster. More than 50 senior appearances later, he is attracting interest from top-flight clubs. Lee Carsley, the England Under-21s manager, watched Hill against Wycombe to see how he would cope with the brawn of Adebayo Akinfenwa and was suitably impressed, calling him up to his squad in November. Hill, son of the former Bristol City full-back Matt, had to withdraw because of a knee injury, but more opportunities beckon. 9) Dan Neil, 20, Sunderland The academy graduate has enjoyed a breakthrough season under Lee Johnson, earning an England Under-20s call-up in November – alongside his club-mate Dennis Cirkin – after starring in midfield. His first professional goal, a delicious left-foot strike against Accrington from outside the box in September, provided a snapshot of his ability and craft. Sunderland view Neil as a future captain and he has already worn the armband in the EFL Trophy. “He’s got that lovely dribbling technique, a little bit like a young Paul Gascoigne,” says Johnson.
10) Ayoub Assal, 19, AFC Wimbledon Perhaps the pick of the bunch when it comes to the Dons’ exciting youngsters, the attacking midfielder has excelled since scoring on his league debut in March. The Dons’ head coach, Mark Robinson, who was formerly academy manager, has nurtured the development of the No 10, who started his career at Millwall. Assal, whose parents are Moroccan, has scored six goals in all competitions this season, impressing alongside Jack Rudoni, 20, Luke McCormick, 22, and the left-back Nesta Guinness-Walker, 22.";https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/01/efl-ten-young-football-league-talents-to-watch-in-2022
6123;6123;Further Covid restrictions in England would be ‘last resort’, says Sajid Javid;2022-01-01T10:51:46Z;['Jedidajah Otte'];['Coronavirus', 'Sajid Javid', 'Politics', 'Health', 'Health policy', 'England', 'UK news'];"New restrictions on freedom in England “must be an absolute last resort”, the health secretary has said. The record-breaking wave of the Omicron Covid variant will, however, “test the limits of finite NHS capacity even more than a typical winter”, Sajid Javid said, as hospital admissions in England climbed to their highest since last January. Writing in the Daily Mail, Javid said England had “welcomed in 2022 with some of the least restrictive measures in Europe”, after the government decided against ramping up protective rules while the devolved countries opted for restrictions on nightclubs, hospitality and new year celebrations. “Curbs on our freedom must be an absolute last resort and the British people rightly expect us to do everything in our power to avert them,” Javid wrote. “Since I came into this role six months ago, I’ve also been acutely conscious of the enormous health, social and economic costs of lockdowns. “So I’ve been determined that we must give ourselves the best chance of living alongside the virus and avoiding strict measures in the future.” The health secretary did emphasise, however, that the time lag between infections and hospital admissions meant it was “inevitable that we will still see a big increase” in the number of Covid patients over the next month and warned that the pandemic was “still far from over”.
A record 189,846 daily new Covid-19 cases were logged in the UK on Friday, according to the government. However, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a Cambridge University statistician, said the actual number could be closer to half a million new infections a day in an “unprecedented wave”. Spiegelhalter, who is chair of the university’s Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication, said the UK’s daily Covid-19 infections could be closer to 500,000 as a result of the testing regime being overstretched and reinfections not being counted in the UK government data. “This is a huge, unprecedented wave of infection and very daunting,” he told the BBC, adding that deaths were “not yet going up” and that the country could be “fairly optimistic” about avoiding the kind of crisis seen during the last winter wave, which reached its peak in mid-January 2021. “It looks like we are going to have a huge wave of cases and that is going to cause big disruption, in hospitals, of course, and other services, but in terms of translating to the very serious outcomes, I think we can be fairly optimistic,” he said. “Things will get worse but it will be nothing like the previous waves.” Hospital admissions in England are currently higher than at any point since last January, with 2,370 people admitted to hospital with Covid-19 on 29 December, a 90% week-on-week increase. Reports have suggested that the government’s current work-from-home guidance in England may remain in place for most of January in a bid to slow the spread of the new variant. The Daily Telegraph reported that the guidance, which is in place as part of England’s plan B measures alongside mask mandates in many public places and mandatory Covid passes for large events, may be extended by another three weeks. Boris Johnson initially said he wanted the measures, which expire six weeks after implementation, lifted “no later than early January and possibly before”. A review of the restrictions is expected on or close to 4 January. • This article was amended on 2 January 2022. An earlier version referred to Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter as a government adviser and member of its Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Although he is officially listed among the Sage participants, he says he attended only one meeting, in April 2020. Also Spiegelhalter told the BBC that “infections” could be close to 500,000, not “cases” as the article previously reported.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/covid-restrictions-england-last-resort-sajid-javid

6125;6125;‘Sauna patrons just sit on the icy street’: Manuel Vazquez’s best phone picture;2022-01-01T10:00:48Z;['Grace Holliday'];['Photography', 'Life and style', 'Art', 'Art and design', 'Culture', 'Mobile phones', 'Smartphones', 'Photography'];"In 2019, the UN named Finland the happiest place in the world, and Manuel Vazquez and journalist Ana Alfageme were sent by a Spanish magazine to find out why. Saunas are a big part of life there; the country has more than 2 million in residential and public settings. The pair agreed that they’d be good places to find locals to interview.
This photo was taken on a sub-zero November day, when only six hours of light can be expected. The pair had already tried out a swanky coastal sauna. “I didn’t think I’d be able to do it,” Vazquez laughs. “But it really does liberate the endorphins. It’s exhilarating.” Next, Vazquez wanted to seek out a more authentic, traditional version that used wood. He had heard of a particularly popular one in the Helsinki neighbourhood of Kallio. “In winter, the practice is to alternate between the sauna and a body of water, like a lake or the sea,” he says. “But because this sauna is in the city, patrons just go and sit on the icy street.”
Vazquez was drawn to the retro neon sign, the way the red light tinted the wet ground, and the myriad details. “They create a narrative, tell a story. The empty chairs next to the men seem to be inviting you to sit with them. “I intended to shoot properly with my digital camera, but first I quickly took this on my Pixel 3, almost like a test shot. Then we went over to break the ice.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/sauna-patrons-sit-on-icy-street-manuel-vazquez-best-phone-picture
6126;6126;22 places to go in 2022: holidays we’re dreaming of this year;2022-01-01T10:00:47Z;['N/A'];['Europe holidays', 'Walking holidays', 'Cultural trips', 'Heritage', 'Travel'];"Scotland Disconnect on the impeccably green island of Eigg In both ethics and aesthetics, Eigg is remarkable. In sustainability terms, it’s unique: the first island, indeed region of the UK, to be self-sufficient in renewable energy. Eigg disconnected from the mainland back in 2008. By balancing solar, water and wind power, the community-owned Eigg Electric provides enough power all year round to supply the 100 or so permanent residents and the 10,000 visitors who come every summer. The wind turbines were positioned on the slopes of Eigg’s landmark mountain, An Sgurr, not only to maximise wind exposure and minimise turbulence, but to fit into the spectacular setting. Even the solar panels on a flowery south-facing hillside look good. Ownership of Eigg was transferred to a Heritage Trust in partnership with the Scottish Wildlife Trust in 1997, with contributions from thousands of members of the public. With empathy and commitment, the community has organised its island so that we can enjoy it too. No visiting cars or campervans are allowed, but it’s small enough for a day trip (from Arisaig on the mainland, a one-hour ferry ride). The redeveloped An Laimhrig community hub with cafe – designed by Hebridean architect Will Tunnell, will open in time for the 25th anniversary of the community takeover this summer – and the annual celebratory party takes place on 12 June.
Nowhere on Eigg is more than a two-mile hike and Charlie’s taxi is usually by the pier. Next door to the cafe, the shop has a surprisingly eclectic range of goodies and essentials, and bikes to hire. Despite Eigg’s size (five miles by three), it has several places to stay, including a guesthouse and a great hostel, and campers are welcomed. A new (sustainable) shower block and cool camping pods (from £45 a night for four) by the pier opened last year, and the Isle of Eigg Brewery, a cooperative operating along impeccably green lines, will open in 2022. The climb up An Sgurr is rewarded with one of the best views in the Highlands. Walks around Laig Bay, with views across to Muck and mighty Rum, could be taken every day, and the ethereal interplay of sand, sea and sky would still mesmerise. Last summer I visited a lot of Scottish islands for a new photo guide to be published in the spring, but none has its act as consummately planned and holistically together as Eigg. isleofeigg.org Pete Irvine, author of Scotland the Best: the Islands, published on 3 March Greece Thessaloniki’s cosmopolitan and tolerant energy
I spent the best part of last summer lying on idyllic and isolated Greek island beaches thinking about a very different place and time: the rich and complicated urban history of Thessaloniki, Greece’s second city. British historian Mark Mazower’s thought-provoking book, Salonica: City of Ghosts, transported me from the Byzantine to the Ottoman era, the city’s integration into the new Greek state in the early 20th century and the fallout from the second world war. As much of the region continues to tread a dangerous path of deepening nationalist hostility, Thessaloniki’s history of diversity and coexistence is a sobering reminder that things do not have to be this way: Christians, Muslims and Jews lived side by side in peace for hundreds of years. Salonica, as it is is also called, was the only city in Europe with a majority Jewish population – the “Jerusalem of the Balkans”, though few survived the Nazi occupation and Holocaust. However, Thessaloniki’s cosmopolitan and tolerant energy survives today, with a vibrant culinary and cultural scene. It was recently named Greece’s first Unesco city of gastronomy I will be going for the Thessaloniki Documentary Festival in March on one of the high-speed trains from Athens which launch this month. From the UK, get a train to Bari or Ancona in Italy, then ferry to Patras and continue on Greek railways (OSE) via Athens to Thessaloniki (with a short substitute bus on the first, Patras-Kiato, section). Alex King France Cycle Grenoble’s riverside parks
The city of Grenoble, in south-east France, has been named Green Capital of Europe for 2022, and while it’s well known to skiers, it makes a great destination year-round. Head there in spring, when the train via Paris whizzes through Burgundy’s blooming vineyards and on into the mountains. Grenoble sits at the point where three valleys meet, and is surrounded by the Belledonne, Vercors and Chartreuse mountains. Getting around is easy: the city’s cycle-share scheme, Métrovélo, has 7,000 bikes, and there are 200 miles of cycling routes in and around the city. Visitors can ride between parks and out along paths that follow the rivers Drac and Isère. For the best views, take the cable car from the city centre up 500 metres to the 19th-century Fort Bastille. Hikers are spoiled for choice with trails that zigzag around the mountains. The food scene has long embraced sustainability, and several restaurants use only local produce. Book a table at Jeanette, where chefs Manon Bocquentin and Thaïs Giannetti use suppliers from within 20 miles of the restaurant and forage for mountain herbs for their delicate and inventive dishes. To rest weary limbs after hiking and biking, check into the bright and modern Okko Grenoble Jardin Hoche Hotel (doubles from €98 room-only) in the ecodistrict of Zac de Bonne. The first of its kind in Europe, it’s a former military brownfield site that was transformed into a sustainable community. Carolyn Boyd Italy Molise is waiting to be discovered
Molise, a sparsely populated region of southern Italy, is so off the radar that many Italians joke that “Molise non esiste” (Molise doesn’t exist). But after visiting for the first time in 2019, I realised the mockery is unfair. Molise contains the very best of Italy, from the scenery to the food. But best of all, it feels like uncharted territory. Being someone who enjoys travelling by train, I am now looking forward to returning in 2022 on board the Molise Express, a vintage train that will show visitors the best of the region’s mountains, coastlines and ancient villages. “Molise is among the least-known regions in Italy,” said Fabrizio Minichetti, president of Le Rotaie-Molise, the association that helped launch the initiative. “But we have mountains, the sea, wonderful scenery and many beauty spots that deserve to be discovered.” The service will be rolled out this year and take passengers through the Biferno valley, from the coastal town of Termoli to the regional capital of Campobasso, stopping off at the villages of Casacalenda and Larino before returning to Termoli. The day trip, costing €24, will give passengers ample time to explore the historic towns, including a trip to the Kalenarte open-air contemporary art museum in Casacalenda. The train carriages, with wooden interiors, date back to the 1920s. The initiative is one of several vintage train routes planned in Italy as the country seeks to promote train tourism. In 2023, the Dolce Vita train will be launched: it’s a luxurious sleeper that will show passengers the best of the Italian landscape, from north to south, with stops in more than 100 cities. The service plans to introduce visitors to lesser-known spots, such as the Sila mountains in Calabria. Angela Giuffrida Czech Republic A monastery and brewery under one roof in Prague
It’s one of the greenest cities in Europe when it comes to parks and open spaces, but Prague has been sluggish on the uptake of sustainability – aside from the newly installed pink city bikes and a sprinkling of zero-waste grocery stores. That’s what makes the Břevnov Monastery such a great spot. Founded in 993, this still-active Benedictine friary is a fascinating U-shaped complex, enveloped in a tangle of trees, lakes and winding little paths. The embedded Adalbert Hotel (doubles from €75 B&B) is an award-winning guesthouse, and its recent eco-revamp has seen it embrace a number of sustainable, planet-saving practices, such as waste reduction, energy saving and using environmentally friendly products. As well as the hotel and monastery (tours available), the complex also rather brilliantly houses a brewery – the oldest in the Czech Republic, no less. You can sample their lagers, IPAs and wheat beers from the bottle shop-cum-beer hovel, or even better, head to their rustic, fire-heated tavern opposite and combine it with a bowl of delicious mushroom soup. Mark Pickering Greece Ancient theatres get back in the act
The Epirus coast is one of the prettiest in Greece, yet one of the least visited, despite having the most accessible stretch of beaches for those who prefer to avoid flying, as it starts south of Igoumenitsa, terminus of the ferries from Italy. I went on holiday to Parga when I was 12 and have vowed to return ever since. Not a resort on everyone’s radar, Parga is built over a double-curve bay. Memories of its transparent waters, fringed as they were by jungle-thick vegetation, merge in my mind with those of Brazil’s, a later love of mine. Syvota, further north, presents an incongruous sight to Greece aficionados: a mountain village lording it over a magnificent coast, whose low treeline resembles a Norwegian fjord. I have long yearned to explore its archipelago of tiny offshore islands and their pristine sandy beaches.
It’s ancient history, though, that grabs me this year, associated with five ancient theatres restored and promoted as part of a new archaeological route. I’m particularly curious about Gitana, with its carved seat names – unusually one reserved for a woman, called Filista – and romantic Dodona, built by Pyrrhus, him of the “pyrrhic” victory which inspired Lord Byron to write a poem. I won’t miss the theatre at ancient Nikopolis, founded by Octavian after his victory against Anthony and Cleopatra. Its successor, Preveza, is a delightful, laid-back town worth exploring that serves both as a cultural springboard and as a holiday choice in its own right, with a good share of pleasingly uncrowded beaches. John Malathronas Slovenia The beaches and cosmopolitan backstreets of Piran
I had spotted it on the map a few years ago: Slovenia has a coastline. Who knew? The region around the Italian port of Trieste is full of such geographic curiosities; the borders having ebbed and flowed with the tides of empire ever since the Romans lost the plot at the close of the sixth century. At the end of the second world war, Tito’s Yugoslavia occupied the wider area, but later agreements pushed back, snipping all but 29 miles of coast from what was, until 1991, the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, sandwiched between Croatia and Italy. Last year I managed to snatch a brief look at one of the towns, Piran, a gorgeous labyrinth of old Venetian architecture around a lovely harbour. It’s the sort of town where you get lost, discover some fantastic back streets, then emerge totally disoriented close to where you started. Despite swapping countries and empires with baffling frequency, it retains a laid-back cosmopolitan ambience. In high summer, I am told, it gets over-populated with visitors, so I’ll avoid those months: I just want to wander in those shady slot canyons of ancient houses, emerging occasionally by the sea to eat a seafood platter or some of the excellent prśut (cured ham) with a glass of a Slovenian wine. The hills behind the town are known for their teran reds and malvazija whites, but don’t miss the other local speciality, dry white rebula. The nearby town of Izola looks interesting and Portorož is said to have a good beach. For cycling tours check out Visit Good Place. Kevin Rushby Germany Cycle all the way to the Black Sea
An unusual, but highly sustainable way to explore some of Germany’s lesser-touted regions is to hop on your bike – or rent one locally – and follow part of the Iron Curtain Trail. Officially called the EuroVelo 13, the trail stretches over 6,000 miles along the former cold war divide between east and west, from the Black Sea up to the Barents Sea. The Germany section combines two separate routes: the Baltic Sea Cycle Route, where you can experience stunning coastal landscapes and beach-peppered holiday islands like Usedom and Rügen; and the German-German Border Trail, whose former depopulated zones have been transformed into a major green belt. As you make your way down past the border areas with Poland and the Czech Republic, you’ll find plenty of nature areas, including the Lauenburg Lakes and Harz mountains, plus dense forests and sights like Wartburg Castle. If it’s not far enough, continue all the way down to the Black Sea. If it’s too far, try the Iron Curtain Gravel Trail. Paul Sullivan Spain Temptation overload on Galicia’s dramatic west coast
Beyond Santiago de Compostela, Spain’s beautifully green north-west corner remains one of the country’s less-visited pockets. On Galicia’s west coast, where the mist-shrouded Costa da Morte gives way to the deep inlets of the Rías Baixas, fabulous fresh seafood, silky Atlantic surf beaches, clifftop hiking trails, up-and-coming albariño wineries and pristine offshore islands are just some of the temptations. Opened in 2020, the sustainability-driven Parador Costa da Morte (doubles from €150), near Muxía, ups the appeal, with design inspired by Galician culture and landscapes; it’s part of a years-in-the-making regeneration project after a 2002 oil spill. Or stay at an inspiring rural hotel such as Casa Fontequeiroso (doubles from €70 B&B)– a stone-built 100-year-old home above off-the-beaten-track Nemiña beach, where Mari Carmen Leis Calo serves home-cooked meals. A quick ferry ride from Vigo (Easter week and May to September) lie the stunning Cíes Islands, whose plunging cliffs and pearly beaches are the stars of the Illas Atlánticas (Atlantic Islands) national park. Take the ferry to Santander or Bilbao with Brittany Ferries, from £101pp) then road-trip or train west to Galicia Isabella Noble Wales A pilgrimage to Bardsey Island
Bardsey Island, or Ynys Enlli, a lump of Precambrian rock in the Irish Sea off the Llŷn peninsula in north-west Wales, has been a place of tranquil worship since the sixth century, and a place of dedicated pilgrimage since the middle ages. I feel as if I have been trying to get there for almost as long. Over the years, I have been foiled by storms twice (the two-mile ferry crossing from the mainland through strong tidal races is frequently disrupted), misadventure and even the birth of one of my children. Going on a “pilgrimage” has seen renewed interest recently, with people seeking meaning and adding purpose to a trip – and in the spirit of the steadfast pilgrimages our forebears made to Bardsey, known as the “Island of 20,000 saints”, I am going to cycle there in 2022 – 150 miles from my home in the Black Mountains, following winding green river valleys and crossing the hauntingly empty moors of mid-Wales. Training for this will help fulfil another key goal for this year: to finally slough off the lockdown laziness and get seriously fit once again. Rob Penn Portugal Algae, almonds and an eco retreat near Olhão
An “old sea dog” known to his family as the Champ, Joaquim Modesto de Brito inspired his grandchildren to build Casa Modesta (doubles from €120 B&B) converted into an ecoretreat from the old family home on the edge of the eastern Algarve’s Ria Formosa, a natural park. The renovation by grandson Carlos Fernandes used locally sourced and sustainable materials, and an organic garden was sown so that the harvest could be enjoyed by guests. A partner of FEE (Foundation for Environmental Education), it has nine rooms, decorated by Fernandes’s sister, Vânia, making features of the original vaulted ceilings and terracotta floors. Local olives, almonds and algae are used in the spa treatments, and bikes are provided for guests to explore the cycle paths along the estuary, as well as the nearby fishing town of Olhão. The family says: “Our door is always open to welcome those who arrive with the same joy with which we would run to our grandparents’ arms when we were little.” Audrey Gillan Belgium Cutting-edge culture in Antwerp
Whether art to you means a directional Dries Van Noten outfit or a dark and dramatic Rubens painting, Antwerp will appeal. The city combines an artistic pedigree dating back to the Flemish masters in the city’s 16th-century golden age with a thriving fashion scene, forward-thinking back-street galleries and edgy warehouse clubs. This year is an especially important year for the city, with the reopening of the Fine Arts Museum (KMSKA) in September after a 10-year renovation. The revamp of its beautiful historic building includes a new wing over four painstakingly restored courtyards. Two halls will be dedicated to Antwerp’s most famous painters: Rubens and Van Dyck. KMSKA is conveniently located in the trendy Zuid neighbourhood, handy for Antwerp’s more recent cultural contributions. Here you’ll find MoMu, a world-famous fashion museum, alongside Ann Demeulemeester’s airy flagship store and Dries van Noten’s Het Modepaleis, which mixes cutting-edge design with vintage furniture. For up and coming designers, try Nationalestraat and Kloosterstraat. For an insight into the future of Antwerpian culture, visit Het Eilandje in the northern docklands. There are forward-thinking restaurants in the Felix Pakhuis warehouse and contemporary galleries along the Artland trail, as well as MAS, a maritime museum with spectacular city views.

Portugal Sustainable luxury in one of Europe’s top surfing towns The town of Ericeira, north of Lisbon, may be famous as a world-class surfing spot, but until now it had no five-star hotel. There is an abundance of hostels and guesthouses, but Immerso (doubles from €175 B&B), built into a green valley just outside the town, will be the first high-level destination hotel aiming to combine a concern for the environment – on local and planetary levels – and luxury. The owners say sustainability is at the heart of the project and that the design and colour palette will reflect the landscape and the sea. Due to open in early summer, Immerso will have 37 rooms and a restaurant – Emme – under the consulting guidance of Michelin-starred chef Alexandre Silva of Lisbon’s Loco restaurant. There will be a vegetable garden, in-house beer production (one Pilsner, one ale) and plans are afoot to host surfboard workshops. Audrey Gillan England Clock up your steps on the Lake District’s Ullswater Way
In late 2020 a new bridge opened at the northern end of Ullswater, five years after Storm Desmond destroyed the old one, and first across it was a flock of sheep. Leave the car behind and go off-season for spring flowers, autumn colours or crisp winter hikes. Penrith station is half an hour away by bus: the 508 rolls from there, past the green fells that rise out of Ullswater’s misty, island-dotted water. Ullswater Steamers from Pooley Bridge run to remote Howtown Pier on the eastern shore of the lake or to the 150-metre-high Aira Force waterfall on the west. The Ullswater Way is a weekend-ready, 20-mile circuit of the lake. It climbs to the iron age circle of Maiden Castle, with views that stretch east to the Pennines, and heads down again through rugged, ferny woods. Fellwalking author Alfred Wainwright called Ullswater “loveliest of lakes, curving gracefully into the far distance”, and opined that the seven mossy waterside miles from Howtown to Glenridding formed the “most beautiful and rewarding walk in Lakeland”. The Ullswater Way opened in 2016; its daffodil waymarkings flag up that this is the lake where Wordsworth wandered past his verse-inspiring flowers. A new five-mile loop from Pooley Bridge leads to the Dalemain Estate, for tea by a log fire in the medieval hall; another detour, added in 2019, takes in Lowther Castle. Stay in a hobbit hole or a cabin with a stargazing roof at green-award-winning glamping complex the Quiet Site (from £85 a night for two adults and four children). It’s right on the Ullswater Way, and there’s a zero-waste shop and off-grid cafe. New pet- and family-friendly, carbon-positive Gingerbread Houses with wooden walls, heat pumps and beech hedges, opened in 2021. Phoebe Taplin Croatia 700km of waterways for the taking in a Unesco biosphere
They’re calling it the “Amazon of Europe” – which might be overselling it a tad – a vast, newly declared Unesco biosphere reserve that follows the routes of the Mura, Drava and Danube rivers as they meander through Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia and Serbia. It’s the biggest protected river area in Europe, covering over 400 miles of waterways, and I’ve got my eye on a couple of areas in Croatia and along its border with Serbia. The first is Kopački Rit nature park, a huge area of wetlands between the Drava and Danube rivers by the Serbian border. You can take a small boat tour along its waterways to watch the birdlife, and hire a bike to cycle along the park’s beautifully flat trails. You could also hop across the border into Serbia and hike through the forested trails of Gornje Podunavlje nature reserve which runs along the Danube. The second area isn’t quite so well known to British visitors. Where the Mura meets the Drava river by the Hungarian border near the village of Legrad, there’s the specially protected nature reserve of Veliki Pažut, where a solar-powered boat runs along the river to spot rare birds, including the little tern. I’d then hire a bike and cycle along the Drava and head inland along the old Iron Curtain EV13 bike trail to the pretty baroque town of Koprivnica. I’d carry on to the village of Hlebine, birthplace of Croatian naive art, which I’ve always found fascinating. And then finish with a swim in Šoderica, a lake formed by the Drava, and a cold beer in one of the lakeside cafes. Mary Novakovich Spain Red wine and Roman ruins in Tarragona
Once the capital of Roman Spain, Tarragona tends to get overlooked, but there’s something for everyone in this elegant Mediterranean city, from ancient monuments to the bars and restaurants of the old town. The city was founded by the Scipio brothers, both Roman generals, in 217BC and their legacy includes a largely intact Roman amphitheatre and circus as well as the spectacular Devil’s Bridge aqueduct two miles north of the city. The city was declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2000. The town is dominated by a 13th-century cathedral, built on the site of a mosque and before that a Roman temple. Unlike Barcelona’s gothic quarter, Tarragona old town hasn’t been lost to tourism. There are excellent restaurants serving local specialities such as romesco de peix, a Catalan fish stew. It’s also a treat to eat in the restaurants by the port, where the fish is cooked more or less straight off the boat. People associate the region with cava, Catalonia’s sparkling wine, but some of Spain’s best reds also come from Tarragona, notably priorat and montsant, and the local Yzaguirre vermouth makes a great aperitif. Tarragona also has a fine city beach, Platja del Miracle. A nine-mile coastal walk runs along beaches and through umbrella pines to Altafulla, a good lunch stop before catching a train back to the city. Those with strong stomachs and no fear of heights might prefer the Port Aventura theme park and its 65mph rollercoaster. Trains to Tarragona leave from Barcelona Passeig de Gràcia every half-hour, taking time 1¼ hours Stephen Burgen England Celebrate the 1,900th birthday of Hadrian’s Wall
This year marks exactly 19 centuries since Emperor Hadrian oversaw the start of work on the 73-mile wall to guard the Roman empire’s remote north-western border – and a year-long festival is planned to celebrate. From the banks of the Tyne in Newcastle to the Solway Firth, west of Carlisle, this Unesco-listed frontier has a national trail tracking it from coast to coast. You can walk beside sections of wall or follow its former course, snaking over grassy hills, past turrets, milecastles and whole Roman towns. There are huge views across the landscapes of Northumberland and Cumbria from ruins like Housesteads fort with its barracks, hospital and communal loos. Fragments of ancient life here – a hobnailed leather shoe or a bowl with a carved soldier’s name – survive in the museum. Hadrian’s Wall 1900 Festival kicks off in late January and will include new site-specific artworks, summer evening concerts, re-enactments, walks, Roman-themed light trails and a travelling Saturnalia. It’s a great time to explore – I intend to walk it in stages over the course of the year. Phoebe Taplin Sweden Rock up at a skyscraping wooden hotel on the east coast
International visitors usually head for Sweden’s big southern cities or the mountainous north, where local companies offer a flurry of wintry outdoor experiences, from ice-carving to snowy horseback safaris. But it’s sometimes the less obvious destinations that offer a true taste of Sweden. Take Skellefteå, 430 miles north of Stockholm along the sand-fringed east coast. By international standards, this former gold-mining outpost is tiny, with a population smaller than Scunthorpe’s. Its eco-credentials are world class, though: Skellefteå is leading the way in sustainable timber construction, and The Wood Hotel (doubles from £150 B&B), with Scandi-minimal and a rooftop terrace, has just opened inside a new cultural centre. This 20-storey architectural triumph is one of the world’s tallest timber buildings, with epic views of the surrounding forests. Skellefteå is not a tourist hub, but it should be. During winter you might see the northern lights, and there are tons of eco-friendly activities to try in the forests nearby, from hiking to elk-spotting. Photographers can snap golden eagles in the wild right through until March, and in summer pristine beaches are perfect for evening swims. Steve Vickers, editor of Routes North Scandinavia travel guide France Brittany’s enchanting coastline and seaweed spas
On a fine sand beach in the small seaside town of Brignogan-Plages on Finistère’s dramatic north coast, Hôtel de la Mer (doubles from €90 room-only) reinvented itself as an ecologically responsible hotel in 2016. The spacious 18-room residence is warmed and powered by renewable energy; it harvests rainwater and recycles as much as possible; and its owners are passionate about the local crop – seaweed. With foraging workshops, seaweed-based spa treatments and seaweed-themed menus in the restaurant, there is much to enjoy, but it is the hotel’s position on this enchanting and little-visited coastline that steals the show. After a day exploring Finistère’s pretty islands and broad sweeping Atlantic beaches, head back to the hotel for a drink, then enjoy a pre-dinner paddle among the rocks in the shallows as the tide creeps in, enjoying the stillness of the evening. And as this region is just an overnight ferry ride away – on Brittany Ferries’ Plymouth-to-Roscoff route – the journey there is stress-free. Carolyn Boyd
England A living artwork in Cornwall’s Eden Project
The huge greenhouse domes that form the Eden Project have gardens inside and out: valleys of spring bulbs, hothouse-pungent rainforests, an oasis of rose and jasmine, and a treetop walkway overlooking palms and papayas. Eden has just announced a new 55-metre-long living artwork. An autumn-planted, bee-friendly Pollinator Pathmaker by artist Alexandra Ginsberg will be a permanent installation, due to be in flower for human and insect visitors by June. You can arrive by train at St Austell station and catch the new Daytripper bus or cycle four miles through wooded valleys. St Austell is also an easy bus or bike ride from sandy beaches, village pubs and the subtropical Lost Gardens of Heligan. It’s a five-minute stroll from the station to St Austell’s Victorian brewery, where seagulls call, the air is heavy with hops and tasting tours have just restarted. Phoebe Taplin Ireland Unwind in a hot seaweed bath in County Waterford
Waterford is curiously overlooked and under-appreciated as a destination. The star destinations of Dublin, Kerry and Galway grab the headlines and by far the greater number of visitors, but the small southern county has an abundance of attractions – and some serious sustainable travel credentials. From historic, walkable and rapidly regenerating Waterford City – recently voted “best place to live in Ireland” in the Irish Times – venture out on the Waterford Greenway, the country’s longest dedicated cycling and walking trail, which runs for 28 miles to Dungarvan using a former railway track that features 11 bridges, three viaducts and a 400-metre tunnel. Alternatively, hug the scenic and secluded Copper Coast, a 15-mile stretch of rugged shoreline between Tramore and Dungarvan that is one of only three Irish Unesco-designated Geoparks. Stop off for seaweed foraging, tastings and beach picnics with Marie Power, or the Sea Gardener (three-hour trips €35). A little further on at Helvick pier is Sólás Na Mara, a wellness centre offering one of Ireland’s oldest natural therapies – hot seaweed baths. Lismore, in the west, is possibly the prettiest town in Ireland and celebrated for its charming cathedral, imposing castle and beautiful River Blackwater views; downstream, in Villierstown, is Blackwater Eco Tours, a not-for-profit community enterprise that has four family-size eco-pods (from €95) and activities such as self-drive boats and canoeing. Hikers heading to the peaks, plateaux, moorlands and corrie lakes of the unexplored Comeragh and Knockmealdown mountains should stay at Nire Valley Eco Camp (from €125 a night for two) which boasts five “bedrooms in a meadow” – stylish solar-powered cabins with dedicated wetlands to process wastewater. “People who stay with us soon realise that Waterford has this fabulous mix of mountains and sea, woodlands and rivers – all within easy reach of each other,” says Hilary Britton, owner of the Getaway (pitches from €20), a new motorhome and glamping eco-park near Dungarvan that provides “clear-conscience camping”. Britton adds: “For most visitors to Ireland, it’s a forgotten county.” Philip Watson Austria Lech-Zurs aims for more sustainable skiing breaks
As a sector that will be hugely affected by global warming, the ski industry is making progress towards a more sustainable model. Pyha, in Finland’s eastern Lapland, wants to become the world’s “cleanest” ski area, and was the first Scandinavian resort to go carbon neutral, back in 2011. Laax, in Switzerland, wants to do the same by 2030 – making the entire resort self-sufficient, not just the mountain infrastructure of lifts and restaurants; many resorts, including Ishgl in the Austrian Tirol, have already achieved this. In Italy’s Trentino region, Pejo 3000 claimed it was the “world’s first plastic-free ski resort” when it banned disposable plastic in 2019.
Also aiming to impress with its eco credentials, and with an epic ski area to boot, is Lech-Zurs in Austria’s Arlberg. Depending on Covid restrictions, it’s worth a visit in 2022. Linked to St Anton, which has some of the best off-piste riding in Europe, and with its own extensive freeride terrain (which gets tracked out far less rapidly thanks to the popularity of long lunches at its mountain restaurants), it is working hard on the green front. The number of guest beds is capped at 10,000 to curtail development, lift pass numbers have been limited, local biomass heaters provide heat and communal hot water, and so on. On the white front there’s plenty of steep off-piste, cruisy pistes to tiny mountain villages, plus shopping for traditional Austrian boots and clothes on Lech’s twinkling main drag. The Alpenland hotel (doubles from €195 half-board) is great value, but better still, escape the glitz in the peaceful riverside hamlet of Zug, staying maybe at the family-run Schafberg (doubles from €125 B&B). Riding a classic off-piste route that drops 1,000 vertical metres from the Madloch-Joch to Zug is a pleasure one hopes will continue. The nearest station is Langen am Arlberg (trains from Innsbruck and Munich) or St Anton (trains from Zurich), both linked by bus Gemma Bowes";https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/01/22-sustainable-holiday-ideas-for-2022-where-were-dreaming-of
6127;6127;After three years of chaos, six US teens tell us how school could be different;2022-01-01T10:00:47Z;['N/A'];['US education', 'Coronavirus', 'US news', 'Young people', 'Education', 'Schools', 'Society'];"Trying to learn AP physics over Zoom. Cancelled standardized tests. The end of Ds and Fs. Masked proms with no slow dancing. While Covid undeniably changed the world for everyone, one place that was truly upended was high school. What started as a short break from in-person class has now affected three different school years. Some changes have been hard: hybrid schedules, masking through eight-hour days, suspended extracurriculars. But the drastic changes have also posed the question: what else could be possible? Could school be more fun, inclusive, different? Here, six seniors across the US offer their best ideas on how high school could be better.
I have cerebral palsy, and I use a wheelchair. At my school, awareness about special needs has grown. But still, some things aren’t accessible. I can get into every classroom on campus, but in some, I can only access the front right corner. At lunch, there are tables that fit my chair, but only some of them, and if my friends don’t sit at one of those, I can’t join them. Honestly, it’s kind of upsetting. I have an outgoing personality, and I like to talk to people. But most of the time, I eat lunch by myself. It’s really important for schools to be inclusive, because they can open up a whole new world for students in wheelchairs. At my school, we have a wheelchair basketball team, and when our team plays a home game, we can fill one side of the bleachers. After we were runners-up at the state championship, the mayor shut down the traffic circle in Tallmadge and gave us a police and fire escort on our way back. It made us feel happy, special and a part of the community. People recognized our accomplishments! I’m also the manager for the football team. I go out and shake hands with the other players, and hang out in the locker room. Being part of the team has been really helpful for making friends. Everyone knows me. We joke that I could be the next mayor of Tallmadge. High schools need to make sure a special needs student is part of the committee preparing for homecoming and prom. This year, I’ll be able to go to graduation because my school moved it to a football stadium with a ramp, which the old location didn’t have. My goal is to walk across it with my walker, not in my chair. Most of my classmates and teachers have only ever seen me in my chair, so their minds will be blown away when I start walking.
I don’t think high schools should push college as much as they do. The college route isn’t always the right one. A lot of people don’t have the finances to pay for school and won’t be able to afford the debt. But the program I’m in, it’s free. I believe it’s going to help me with my future. I was going to a regular school my freshman and sophomore years. I thought it would be just like middle school, but I got a rude awakening. My grades weren’t the best, and I didn’t have a relationship with my teachers. I was ashamed to ask questions. One day, my mom got an email about career and technical education programs. I did my research, andapplied to the program. Now, I love school. I’m really good with hands-on things – working with tools and knowing how things work. I want to be great at my craft. That’s what I stand for. I have now learned how to braze copper pipes. I have an internship at a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) supply store. I’ve been there about a month and a half, and I have to learn all of the parts, so I can help customers. I’m on track to graduate in the spring, and I want to join the union – Steamfitters 602. I’ll be working and going to school at night, two nights a week, 15 Saturdays per year. You go to college, you do your four years and then you graduate, but you still have to find a job. With this program, I’ll get a job like that. I’ll get a fair shot at providing for my family straight out of high school. Eventually, I want to start my own business. But right now, they’re teaching me how to do the work. There are 15 people in my class, and it feels like a family.
Schools should really consider starting later and offering more flexible schedules. Students will have more downtime, and be more focused when they get to campus. I’m an extrovert, and I did not like doing online school. But I’m also self motivated, and I was able to create my own schedule, so I could do the things I like – like yoga – during the school day. I feel like I grew up a lot during that time. Having school start at 8.05am again this year was rough. I get up at 5.30, but I’m really busy, so it limited what I could get done before class. Lots of my friends sleep until the very last minute and roll out of bed and come to school without even brushing their hair. Even an extra half hour would have made the adjustment easier. Going back to school and having to ask to use the restroom also felt odd. My friends were feeling it, too. I work in an after-school program. During quarantine, a lot of kids got jobs during the day, and did school work late at night. One friend of mine works at Starbucks. His school lets him take a free period first period of the day, and he works from 4.30 until 7.30am, then goes to school
I’m the child of a single mother who is an immigrant. My mom only got a middle school education, and when she came to the US, she got a job cleaning houses so I could pursue a better life. I always thought higher education wasn’t an option for me. But programs at school have made me realize it is possible. Right now, I’m one of the 10 students sharing my input and my experiences within the public school system to help create an intensive, one-year program for students at different high schools in San Francisco looking to get into Stem-focused careers called the Mission Bay Hub. We’re hoping it will offer tools and equipment that actual scientists use. I’ve told them that it’s really important to have a big open space, because many of our classrooms are cramped. When volunteers come into the hub, they should be a diverse and representative group – like us. Honestly, being part of the program feels awesome – I feel like I’m doing something positive for my younger siblings and cousins in this system. I feel like I’m creating a change in our education. Schools should allow students to meet with the principal and board members, instead of having one-minute, once a month opportunities.
Last year, I started community college classes during high school. Next spring, I’ll graduate from community college three weeks before I graduate from high school, with 62 hours of college credit. The state of Oklahoma covers a lot of the tuition for concurrent enrollment students. And the Creek Nation, which I’m a member of, covered most of the rest. My mom estimates that my parents paid for the cost of a couple of books – that’s it. Everyone should have opportunity to study the same way I did. It helps students become familiar with the college application process, how to navigate the different departments at college, and the difference between high school and college classes. In high school, you’re with this same group of kids, and the teacher is pushing you to do your work. In college, it’s all on you. I have a head start on my future. I should graduate in two and a half years – and save my parents about $50,000. It prepares students for college, and is a huge self esteem booster. I look at it and think, “I did that.”
A lot of kids my age don’t even know how to sew on a button. If I were going to change high school, I would make sure that students learn the basic life skills you need outside of school. Personally, I don’t know anything about cars. Something happened to my tire when I was at school, and my boyfriend and I had to call another friend to show us how to change it. So I’d make the first quarter of the class automotive – how to check your oil and your coolant, change a tire – things like that. In the second quarter, you could teach students how to cook from scratch. It’s cheaper than fast food, healthier too. And I would know. One of my three jobs is working at McDonald’s as a shift leader. I’ve been a member of a youth organization called Future Farmers of America that prepares students for careers in agriculture since I was a freshman, and it has had a huge impact on my life. Now, I know different breeds of pigs and cattle, and what they’re all for. The third quarter would focus on sewing. I only learned how to sew recently when I made masks with my grandma during the pandemic. I don’t want to have to pay a fee every time I want to get something fixed. The fourth quarter would be more about financial literacy, and setting up a savings account. My freshman year, a teacher taught us how to write a check. But here I am about to graduate, and that’s as far as I’ve gotten.";https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/01/us-high-school-covid-pandemic-how-to-change
6128;6128;Jamie-Lee O’Donnell: ‘We’ve been able to show the world the real Derry’;2022-01-01T10:00:46Z;['Michael Segalov'];['Television', 'Culture', 'Television & radio', 'TV comedy', 'Drama', 'Derry Girls', 'Northern Ireland'];"In a park opposite Belfast’s Saint Anne’s Cathedral, Jamie-Lee O’Donnell is being photographed. It is a small, unassuming shoot; she has only popped outside briefly, catching a short spurt of sunshine on an otherwise gloomy Saturday. Yet within minutes, passersby are stopping on surrounding streets: murmurs of excitement, fingers pointing. A steady stream of selfie-hungry teenage girls muster up the courage to edge closer. “Oh feck,” I hear from behind me, “that’s Michelle from Derry Girls!” Now filming its third and final series, Derry Girls has proved popular beyond all expectations. Critical acclaim was matched by nationwide public adoration: the show was Channel 4’s biggest new comedy in five years. And in Northern Ireland, the joyful sitcom set in 1990s Derry is a fully fledged sensation; the most watched series in the country since modern records began. Overnight, its lead actors were elevated to national treasure status. En route to meet O’Donnell, I had mentioned the purpose of my visit to my stoic, middle-aged taxi driver and he immediately turned giddy. Later, a mix-up over permissions to take pictures inside the gallery where we’re meeting was quickly resolved: one of the Derry Girls, is it? No bother, carry on.
“It’s just so lovely,” O’Donnell says, taking a seat opposite me back inside the city’s Metropolitan Arts Centre (the Mac). “When we film outside in Derry, we often have to ask our audience to keep it down while we’re shooting a scene.” O’Donnell lived in the city for most of her life, although recently she has moved to another part of the country. She would rather not say where exactly. “I had a wee bit of trouble with people finding out where we lived and coming to say: ‘Hello, here’s my grandma.’” In Derry Girls, the 34-year-old plays the much-loved Michelle, a sexually liberated schoolgirl with a penchant for profanity. Her sharp one-liners are a series standout: “Do you think if I told him I had an incendiary device down my knickers he’d have a look?” she asks, when armed soldiers board her bus unannounced. In person, O’Donnell shares Michelle’s quick wit. She is also thoughtful and warm, and if anything a little nervous, a far cry from the abrasive over-confidence she exudes in the show as Michelle.
We are here today to talk about her upcoming show, Screw, a gritty drama set in the wing of a men’s prison. O’Donnell takes on the part ofplays Rose, a freshly hired trainee guard. “She’s a really strong, tough young woman,” O’Donnell says of her character. “There’s something about her which just spoke to me: she undervalues herself a lot, and doesn’t see the strength inside her.” In almost every way, Michelle and Rose are polar opposites. “Although,” she adds, straight-faced, “they do happen to have the same curly hair.”
O’Donnell is fiercely proud of being a true Derry girl. She grew up on the border between County Derry and Donegal; the north and the Republic. Despite being a generation on from the character she plays in Derry Girls, set in the years before the Good Friday agreement was signed in 1998, she too was raised in the shadows of the Troubles. “It’s such recent history, and a vital part of who people in Derry are,” she says. “It shapes our outlooks, our humour, our personalities. How we feel things so strongly, and love so fiercely.” Creating characters through her childhood allowed her to imagine other possibilities. “I was such a little weirdo,” she recalls with a grin. “I had so many outfits to dress up in. I’d make up these personas, each with different hats. I’ve no idea where I got them.” Every evening, she would come to dinner with a show to perform at the table. Drama school was never on the cards, in part because of the cost, but it also wasn’t on the family’s radar. That is not to say that her creative side wasn’t encouraged: she would write poetry, plays and songs, and stand in Derry city centre, ready to perform intense immersive theatre to any unsuspecting shopper who would catch her eye.
After a brief stint at Leicester’s De Montfort University, O’Donnell dropped out and set about trying to find herself an agent. She found gigs as a self-taught nightclub dancer and performed in pantos. She moved around in search of work – London, Belfast, Manchester – taking on whatever she could, be it retail or restaurant work, or on-street promotions. “I managed a Santa’s grotto for a while,” she says. “I had to fire two elves for coming in drunk, stinking of booze, after clubbing all night at the Warehouse Project. I could hear them wobbling towards me because of the bells on their hats and shoes.” One of them threw up in a bin while Santa was with a group of toddlers.
“Around then was the first time I really realised where I was from,” O’Donnell says. “I got a job working at a coffee shop in Manchester. I remember flicking through my contract and asking the other staff: why doesn’t it say whether you get paid for bomb scares? Back at home, this was a standard question: will I lose wages if we’re forced to close for an evacuation? But they all looked back at me like I had two heads.” By 2017, O’Donnell had returned to Derry and bought a corner shop. “It was good craic,” she says. “I was eating crisp sandwiches constantly. I didn’t make any money, if anything I lost a bit.” It was then, finally, that acting work started to come in regularly. She shut up shop when she was cast in a touring production of I Told My Mum I Was Going on an RE Trip, a play about young women’s abortion experiences. “We actually performed it right here at the Mac,” she says. “There were people protesting outside, saying it was an abomination.” Access to abortion services remains difficult in Northern Ireland today, but back then abortion rights were almost nonexistent in the country, except in the most extreme of cases. “I’m very proud of that show,” O’Donnell says. “To have helped continue the conversation. In my opinion, it’s healthcare for women. It’s really close to my heart. It affects me directly.”
Around the same time, O’Donnell read an article about a new Channel 4 sitcom written by the Derry-born writer Lisa McGee. “Right away I knew it would be hilarious,” she says. “I was desperate to be a part of it. As soon as I read the scenes, I felt something. I knew every single one of these girls.” There were eight months between O’Donnell’s first audition and casting, during which time she presumed it simply wouldn’t happen. When she got the call to say she had bagged the part, the years of graft felt worth it. During filming – on intensive Belfast shoots, and on location in Derry – cast and crew would laugh constantly. “We all had this feeling,” she adds, “but we didn’t want to jinx it. Then the first episode came out, and everything went crazy. It hasn’t stopped since.”
There is magic, certainly, in the show’s performances and writing. But it’s the personal, heartfelt portrait of a place so rarely seen or heard of outside the context of conflict and tension that truly casts a spell. “We’ve been able to show the world the real Derry,” O’Donnell says. “Not the one from the news, but our one. Not a conflict zone, but a community. It’s such a huge responsibility …” O’Donnell, tears in her eyes, takes a second. “Sorry,” she sniffs, smiling. “It’s just nice to show the Derry we know. Why am I getting upset? This is ridiculous.”
Saying goodbye to Michelle was always going to be sad. Derry Girls has changed her life for ever. “When you step on set as Michelle,” she says, “the gloves are off and you can just go full-throttle ballistic. There’s this freedom whenever I’m playing her.” With Screw about to be released and Derry Girls ending, O’Donnell is in a state of transition. On screen, she is going from schoolgirl to working woman, but her own life is also evolving. Initially, when things took off, she felt out of place at red-carpet events; enjoying her successes felt indulgent, but that is changing. “It’s almost turning to guilt now,” O’Donnell says. “Maybe that’s too strong a word. It’s just my identity was shaped entirely by being a working-class woman focused on a single goal.” She is still that person, she’s quick to add. “But once you start to achieve it, then what happens? Being a struggling actor was a huge part of who I was. Now I’ve realised I’m not terrified of what comes next any more. And that’s great, but in its own way, scary, too.” That is why, even when Derry Girls wraps, O’Donnell won’t say goodbye to Michelle completely. She will continue to channel her no-shits-given energy from time to time: “I hope Michelle will live on in me. Although, only a wee bit.

When I read it I burst into tears. It showed a sea of almost totally white faces, some of whom had been approaching retirement when I started out as an editorial assistant 20 years earlier. The stagnation in the industry was stark and filled me with despair. Analysis of the industry since then, partly led by pressure from BLM and an open letter from the Black Writers Guild, has only further highlighted this imbalance. Two of the biggest global publishers, Penguin Random House and Hachette, revealed that just 2.7% of their staff – in both cases – are black; and the Guardian reported that you are eight times more likely to see an animal as lead character in a children’s book than a person of colour. In a modern, multicultural nation, the whiteness of the industry matters. This summer, the bestselling author Kate Clanchy chose to rewrite her memoir after an outcry over her portrayal of minority-ethnic children. Her book, Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me, used racialised terminology such as “chocolate-coloured skin”, it referred to one student as “African Jonathon”, a Somali child as having a “narrow skull” and described another as being “so small and square and Afghan with his big nose and premature moustache”. I’ve sat in weekly new business meetings across three of the five major publishing houses week in week out for decades, invariably surrounded by all-white teams who between them not only decide what should and shouldn’t be published but also give final signoff to books before they’re printed. For me, and other people of colour in the industry, this was the moment we’ve been sounding the alarm bell about for years. The furore about Clanchy on social media left me astonished. I watched in horror as posters argued ferociously over whether it’s OK or not to comment on the shape of a black child’s skull. People raged, asking how Clanchy’s use of language could have been published. For me, the answer could be found easily in that white-dominated editors’ list, and the fact that, for years, loud and growing calls to diversify its teams have been pretty much ignored. No wonder the industry today finds itself in a complete mess on race. There is a crippling and toxic silence around everyday racism and how it manifests in the media: erasure, sidelining, stunting of careers, the sheer mental exhaustion of operating daily in a predominantly white space and the routine grind of being marginalised. A couple of years ago I left one of the major publishers and now work from my two-up two-down in Wales, supporting talent behind the scenes. I focused instead on agenting David Harewood’s memoir and its important, groundbreaking discussion of black mental health. And I worked with Lenny Henry on his first novel for children, about a black child who is able to fly – helping to address that lack of black lead characters. I empathise with Vanessa Kingori, the black chief business officer at Condé Nast, who says that when she joined Vogue at the same time as editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, their joint aspiration “was always to normalise the marginalised”. Meanwhile, I’ve observed within publishing the increasing mention and use of “sensitivity readers”. What on earth are they, you might ask. Essentially a little freelance cottage industry of marginalised folk has sprung up, post-Clanchy, to check that books aren’t racist, disablist or any other -ist before they’re sent to print. What this means is that the predominantly white editors commissioning and publishing books featuring characters from diverse backgrounds are now checking these books with readers from these backgrounds in order to ensure publication does not cause accidental offence. And backlist titles, too, are being rethought – a recent example being that of an east Asian character from David Walliams’ The World’s Worst Children. It is now published without the character Brian Wong, Who Was Never, Ever Wrong, following a complaint from a reader who had picked up on the way Brian had been illustrated, wearing glasses and with “small eyes”. But, for me, “sensitivity readers” are an inadequate, sticking-plaster solution. Why use freelancers when you could actually fully employ commissioning editors and publishers of all backgrounds? Shouldn’t there be enough diversity within the industry itself to ensure work can be properly checked for sensitivity? Given the industry seems incapable of this, perhaps it needs an independent body to advise it on equality and monitor progress. As a black, straight woman who commissioned and edited a memoir by a white, gay man (that sold more than 450,000 copies with not a sensitivity reader in sight), I’d say that we have far more in common as human beings than differences. I don’t feel like a minority: there are lots of people around the world who look like me. Sharing all of our stories with respect and sensitivity really shouldn’t be this hard.

6130;6130;Epic match beckons as Wimbledon locals take on tennis club expansion;2022-01-01T10:00:45Z;['Rupert Neate'];['Real estate', 'Planning policy', 'Wimbledon', 'Sport', 'Tennis', 'Politics', 'UK news', 'Business', 'Protest', 'Communities', 'Law'];"A battle is brewing in SW19. Local residents, environmental and heritage groups are preparing to launch a public relations and legal salvo against Wimbledon’s plans to develop historic Capability Brown parkland into 39 new tennis courts for the championships. The campaigners claim the All England Lawn Tennis Club’s (AELTC) designs for a new 8,000-seat show court and 38 other grass courts on a golf course next to the world-famous SW19 club breaches a covenant that prevents building on the Grade II* listed parkland. When it bought the freehold of the golf course from Merton borough council for £5.2m in 1993, the All England club agreed to a legal covenant “preventing the use of the land otherwise than for leisure or recreation purposes or as an open space”.
Despite the covenant, the All England club has submitted plans to Merton and Wandsworth councils for a 95-metre long, 28-metre high 8,000-seat “Parkland show court” on the land designed by Capability Brown for the first Earl Spencer in 1768. The club says it needs to build the new show court on the protected parkland because there is not enough space on its current site, and it urgently requires higher capacity courts to compete with the other grand slam tournaments. The club has promised the campaigners, who number in their thousands and include several prominent London lawyers, that the show court will be “a world-class building matching the beauty of its surroundings and paying tribute to the site’s rich history”. The plans, which the club said would enhance its “tennis in an English garden” image, also include 38 ground courts, several ancillary buildings and 9.4km of roads and paths. More than 1,200 people have submitted formal objections via the councils’ websites. Ahead of a planning decision expected in the spring, several local residents associations, heritage and environmental groups, and local politicians are forming a “non-political umbrella group” to begin a public and legal fight against the All England club’s plan. Chris Baker, director of the Capability Brown Society, said the plans would “destroy forever” land laid out by Brown 240 years ago. “This act of desecration will be a savage act of vandalism by the All England – who claim to have ‘heritage is in our DNA’,” Baker said. Baker said the coalition of interest groups aimed to “first fight the All England in the court of public opinion”, but has also asked lawyers to prepare for a legal battle over the status of the covenant if planning permission is granted. “The All England were good neighbours, but local opinion is fast turning against them,” Baker said. “The great majority of locals are scared to death that they are going to wreck the park. They are interested in only one thing and that is revenue and the extra income their new developments on the golf course will generate.” Thelma Fry, 96, who has lived in a block of flats overlooking the park for 30 years, said she was “devastated and heartbroken” by the proposals. “I am just one person against the endless wealth and influence of All England Tennis,” Fry said. “As I grow older, my pleasure in life is ever more dependent on the view from my window. The trees, grass and lake of Capability Brown’s landscape. I am devastated and heartbroken that it will be ruined by the All England plans. “They have assured me it will take years to build, which means that for the remainder of my life, instead of my present glorious view I will overlook a building site.”
Iain Simpson, chairman of Wimbledon Park Residents Association, which represents more than 10,000 local households, accused the All England club of deceiving local people by submitting plans that breach the covenant it signed promising not to build on the land when it bought it in 1993. Simpson dug out Merton’s minutes from when the council agreed to sell the golf club land on the condition that the All England signed a covenant promising “not to use it except for leisure or recreational purposes or as an open space and not to build on it”. At the time, the then-chairman of the All England club, John Curry, said: “We completely understand and support everyone’s determination to keep the land open and we have purchased the land on that basis.” Tony Colman, leader of Merton borough council, said: “This council is resolute that the land will be retained as open space. All England has bought the land knowing this is our policy and is aware that we would not allow development of the site.” When Simpson recently wrote to Ian Hewitt, the current All England chairman, reminding him of the covenant and his predecessor’s promise, Hewitt replied that: “I am sure you can appreciate that the requirements of the club and the community have developed in the resulting 28 years and that the AELTC has needed to work to ensure that the championships remain a pre-eminent tennis tournament and continue delivering significant and improved socioeconomic benefits to the local area.” “Residents and the public have been deceived about their intentions,” Simpson said in letter sent to thousands of local homes earlier this month. “Why should we believe anything they say?” In a statement, Hewitt said: “Private land covenants do not form part of the public planning process but are to be dealt with outside that process. The AELTC’s view is that it would be appropriate for any discussion/consideration in relation to the covenants to take place once the planning application has been determined.”
Hewitt said the proposed new courts were “vital to the future of Wimbledon – to the hampionships, to the people of Wimbledon, and to tennis in the UK and globally. We need to deliver on these aspirations in order to maintain Wimbledon’s position at the pinnacle of the sport.” A spokesperson for Merton borough council said: “A legal covenant is not a material planning consideration in a planning application assessment. “The All England Lawn Tennis Club’s application is currently under assessment and it will likely be decided by the planning committee: as yet we don’t have a committee date in mind as the application is still under assessment by officers.” The All England club rented the land to Wimbledon Park Golf Club on a lease due to expire in 2041. However, eager to expand the championships and accommodate preliminary matches on site, the tennis club offered the golf club members £65m to buy out the lease and expand its footprint. The golf club members, who included Piers Morgan, Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, and former cabinet secretary Lord O’Donnell, voted in favour of the deal in 2018 and each collected a £85,000 windfall.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/01/epic-match-beckons-as-wimbledon-locals-take-on-tennis-club-expansion
6131;6131;Republicans aim to sow outrage, Trump-style, with an eye on 2022 midterms;2022-01-01T10:00:45Z;['Lauren Gambino'];['US politics', 'Republicans', 'US news', 'Democrats'];"The debate was ostensibly over a stop-gap spending bill that would avert a government shutdown. But Chip Roy, a Republican congressman from Texas, seized the opportunity to accuse Democrats of supporting “unconstitutional” vaccine mandates, critical race theory, “woke gender ideology” and open borders. A vote to fund the federal government, he warned, was a vote to allow “tyranny over the American citizen”. The speech infuriated Congressman Tim Ryan, a Democrat from Ohio. “Tyranny?” Ryan fumed on the House floor. “What are you people talking about? We’re talking about universal preschool, and they have it as a communist indoctrination of the American student. It’s insane.” Ryan’s frustration crystallized a dilemma for Democrats as they defend paper-thin majorities in Congress next year: how to talk about their legislative victories when Republicans are talking about everything else. Emboldened by a string of off-cycle electoral victories, Republicans are embracing the culture war battles that Donald Trump waged from the White House as a strategy for winning back control of the House and Senate in the 2022 midterm elections. “Lean into the culture war,” was the title of a June memo from the leader of the House Republican Study Committee, Indiana congressman Jim Banks. The “culture war” offensive comes as Democrats, facing deep economic malaise and historical headwinds, race to deliver on the president’s domestic agenda, which includes an ambitious social policy package that faces serious legislative hurdles, hampered by Democratic holdout senator Joe Manchin. “We have a plan to give you a better country, and they have a ploy to win back power for themselves,” said New York congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “We are tackling the tough problems of the economy and the pandemic. They seek only to win power and will say or do anything to achieve that.” The party controlling the White House typically loses seats in the first midterm elections of a new presidency. With Biden’s plunging poll numbers, uncertainty over the centerpiece of his legislative agenda and Republicans’ redistricting edge, Democrats are increasingly dour about their chances. In the House, Democrats can only afford to lose a handful of seats; in the Senate they cannot afford to lose a single one. Maloney said selling their economic achievements – a popular, bipartisan infrastructure law and a poverty-reducing pandemic relief package – is critical for Democrats. But he said the party must also aggressively confront the Republican cultural assault. He urged Democrats to call out the opposition party’s embrace of “dangerous and reckless conduct”, which includes amplifying Trump’s false claims of a stolen election and downplaying the seriousness of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. On social issues, he believes that Republicans have pushed too far, particularly on the issue of abortion. As the supreme court considers whether to weaken or overturn the landmark Roe v Wade precedent, Democrats are loudly trumpeting their support for women’s reproductive rights, as they try portray Republicans as an increasingly extreme party determined to ban abortion. “We’re dealing with a Republican party that wants to ban abortion in all 50 states, bring back mass incarceration and burn books,” he added. “We’re not just going to respond, we’re going to be on offense.” Grievance politics is not a new strategy for Republicans. In 1968, Richard Nixon employed the “Southern Strategy” to exploit white racial grievances coded in language such as “law and order” and “states’ rights”. But as partisanship grows and the parties become increasingly hostile to one another, so too has the potential political benefit of cultural warfare that inflames division and energizes their base. A recent report by the Public Religion Research Institute and Brookings Institution, titled Competing Visions of America, found that 80% of Republicans believe that “America is in danger of losing its culture and identity”. By comparison, just 33% of Democrats agree. Meanwhile, 70% of Republicans say “American culture and way of life have changed for the worse since the 1950s” while more than six in 10 Democrats say it has changed for the better. As Democrats negotiate amongst themselves over how to pass Biden’s signature domestic policy bill, Republicans have been seeding outrage over – and fundraising off of – all manner of perceived injustices from cancel culture to Dr Seuss to the 1619 Project. They are hammering the administration over its handling of immigration at the southern border and Democrats over rising crime rates in cities. And Biden’s efforts to pursue racial equity as part of his governing agenda has drawn accusations of racism from conservatives who say the efforts discriminate against white people. Republicans are also leading the charge against the administration’s vaccine mandates for companies with more than 100 employees, which they say is an example of “radical” Democratic overreach. On that issue, Republicans are speaking to their base, which is disproportionately unvaccinated. An NPR analysis found that the stronger a county’s support for Trump in the 2020 election, the lower its Covid-19 vaccination rate. But Republicans are betting that opposition to vaccine mandates, terms of personal liberty, will resonate beyond their base. In legal challenges to the mandates, Republican leaders argue that the vaccine mandates will worsen the nation’s supply chain problems and exacerbate labor shortages that have arisen during the pandemic. But with the Omicron variant circulating, Democrats believe public sentiment is firmly behind them. Americans increasingly support vaccine mandates for workers, students, and in everyday public life, according to a recent CNN poll, which found 54% in favor of requiring vaccinations for employees returning to the office. The challenge for Republicans is to avoid alienating moderate voters in the suburbs with their efforts to energize their supporters who are deeply loyal to Trump and have come to expect their politicians to loudly voice their grievances. Republicans believe their unexpected success in Virginia, a state Biden won by 10 percentage points in 2020, provides a playbook. In November, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the race for Virginia governor after pledging to ban critical race theory from the state’s public schools. Democrats were surprised by the potency over culture war fight over education, allowing Youngkin to rev up the conservative base while appealing to suburban parents’ frustrations over Covid-19 school closures and masking protocols in classrooms. “It’s the oldest trick in the book,” said Anat Shenker-Osorio, a messaging expert and host of Words To Win By. “It’s creating some sort of an ‘other’ so that we don’t notice that they’re actually the cause of our problems.” In Virginia and elsewhere, she said Democrats were caught “flat-footed” by concerns over critical race theory, a concept that, until recently, few outside of academia had ever heard of. Instead of confronting it, she said Democrats’ instinct was to deny support and dismiss the charge as a right-wing talking point, neither of which satisfied voters. Democrats need “an explanation for the rightwing’s origin story of ‘this is why you’re suffering white man in the post-industrial midwest’,” Shenker-Osorio said. “Unless we can talk about race, about gender, about gender identity, our economic promise isn’t going to land.” Columnist Will Bunch, writing in the Philadelphia Inquirer, put it another way: “Once again, the Democrats showed up to a culture war gunfight brandishing a 2,000-page piece of legislation.” While Democrats agree they have a problem, they are at odds over how to fix it. Some argue that the party has moved too far left on cultural issues, a shift that has alienated non-college educated white voters and, increasingly, working-class Latino and Black Americans. Another cohort believes that instead of trying to recapture the voters who have abandoned the party, Democrats should find a message that appeals to a diversifying electorate. Proponents of this approach believe Democrats should respond to the right’s attacks by adopting what they call a “race-class narrative”, which Shenker-Osorio helped develop. The approach explicitly accuses Republicans of using racism or racial dog whistles as a divide-and-conquer tactic to sow distrust, undermine faith in government and protect the wealthy. When applied, the message not only defangs Republican attacks, it motivates and mobilizes voters of all races, its advocates argue. “Our task is to make the idea of joining together across our differences – the idea of multiracial solidarity, as a means to collectively get these shared values that we all want – sexier than the grievance politics that the right is selling,” said Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the co-founder and chief strategy officer of Way to Win. In a recently published memo, advocated candidates use the “blows are landing because our agenda and accomplishments remain so far undefined in the minds of voters”. Among its messaging recommendations, the group urges Democrats to contrast the party’s economic vision with a “Republican party that is beholden to Maga extremism” while doing more to sell their legislative achievements and highlight the steps they’ve taken to combat Covid. “The good news is that these are not insurmountable challenges,” the memo states. An increasingly vocal coterie of liberal critics believe the outlook is grimmer: that Democrats are staring into the political wilderness unless they are able to win back some of the non-college educated voters who abandoned the party. Ruy Teixeira, a demographer and election analyst, believes Democrats have moved too far left on social issues like crime and immigration and is in need of a complete rebrand. He said Trump’s gains with non-college educated Hispanic voters was a “real wake-up call” that Democrats need to change course. “We need a durable majority,” he said. “You can’t build a durable majority by ignoring socio-cultural concerns and the values of these huge swaths of the population.” Where Democrats agree is that they must deliver on their promises while in power. “We’re really just at the beginning of what needs to be a substantial change in the way the American economic model works,” Teixeira said. “And to do that, it’s not enough to just win one election and pass some stuff. We need to win a number of elections and pass even more stuff … It’s not much more complicated than that.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/01/republicans-sow-outrage-trump-style-2022-midterms-house-senate
6132;6132;F1 takes the US and Canada take Qatar: our bold sports predictions for 2022;2022-01-01T10:00:45Z;['Melissa Jacobs', 'Andrew Lawrence', 'Tumaini Carayol', 'Oliver Connolly', 'Beau Dure', 'Hunter Felt', 'Bryan Armen Graham'];['US sports', 'NFL', 'MLB', 'NBA', 'Sport', 'Basketball', 'Baseball', 'Canada'];"Here are our bold predictions for 2022 in sports. Please note the bold (or should that be bold?) in bold predictions: these are to be taken with a pinch of salt. The Detroit Lions will win the NFC North Bold to the nth degree? Perhaps. Bonkers? Absolutely not. Dan Campbell’s squad has a lot of positives to build on heading into next season beyond the stunning win over Arizona. Detroit’s stellar offensive line returns all five starters next year. Jared Goff has settled in and should be a serviceable stopgap, allowing the Lions to spend their (probable) No 2 draft pick on a stud pass rusher or wideout. And Campbell, for all his game management flaws, has a roster that has fully bought into his culture shift. When Aaron Rodgers leaves for Denver or retires and the Bears muff their coaching hire and the Vikings underperform, the rapidly improving Lions will be ready to pounce. MJ Canada will reach the World Cup quarter-finals Canada haven’t even come close to qualifying for the World Cup since their first and only appearance back in 1986. That will change this year – they’re currently top of the Concacaf octagonal after going eight games unbeaten – owing to a glut of young stars who have developed into major contributors at European clubs, among them Champions League medal-holder Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich), Jonathan David (Lille), Cyle Larin (Besiktas) and Tajon Buchanan (Club Brugge). As ever, so much is down to the draw. But if John Herdman’s side can manage to avoid a true group of death, look for Canada make it out of pool play and match Costa Rica’s Concacaf coming-out of eight years ago. BAG Formula 1 will overtake Nascar and IndyCar’s US audience It took a few decades, but F1 finally figured out the most direct path into an American TV viewer’s heart is through soapy drama. The messier, the better. Netflix’s Drive to Survive docuseries hooked us on these foreign characters, their base desires and the frustrating obstacles in between – to the point that the idea of missing a race (let alone qualifying or a practice session) would be like watching a season of the Real Housewives without also tuning into the reunion shows. The Abu Dhabi finale had an audience of a million, and its controversial ending (I’ll say it again: Lewis Hamilton was robbed) will go down as the sport’s Who Shot JR moment. Which is to say everyone and their mother will be tuning in mid-March to see how this cliffhanger resolves. While a million viewers might not sound like much compared to the NFL, that’s about half the audience for Nascar, the US’s most-watched motorsport, and their ratings have been in free fall for years. This year’s US Grand Prix attracted more than 400,000 people to Austin for the race weekend. Next spring a second USGP race comes to the streets of Miami, maybe the most F1 American city there is. (It has the glamor, the international flavor, the speed culture and a coastline that will look sumptuous in aerial shots.) To put it in terms a new F1 might understand: Nascar might be in the lead, but F1’s following close behind and about to enter the DRS zone. To put it even more plainly: I live in Nascar country, but more and more I find myself skidding into coffee shop conversations about Hamilton’s pet bulldog Roscoe or Lando Norris’s Twitch channel. Face it, Formula 1 is on the march. The only question is how long before it pulls away from Nascar for good. AL
Dominic Thiem will return to the US Open final Instead of consolidating his place at the top of the sport after his maiden US Open title in 2020, this season was the nadir of Dominic Thiem’s career. After mental burnout early in the year, he suffered a serious wrist injury in June, had a major setback in August and then his comeback timeline was recently ruined by a cold. It will take a considerable amount time for Thiem to regain his form and trademark intensity, but he will finish 2022 back amongst the best. TC The NFL plots an 18th game … to be played overseas The NFL adding a 17th regular-season game was always a stopping point on the way to the much-desired 18th game. Pair that with the fact the league recently announced international marketing areas for 18 teams in 26 different markets across eight countries – an announcement that was light on details but large on marketing ease – and it’s not difficult to see the eventual blueprint: an international round (or a weekly individual game) played in each of those respective markets. Asking teams to travel and forfeit a home game has always been a sticking point for the league’s international series, making it tricky to consistently send some of the league’s most popular franchises to games held in London, Mexico City or Canada. The new marketing agreement adds Australia, Brazil, China, Germany and Spain to the league’s formal international agreements. With retirement nearing for commissioner Roger Goodell, it’s easy to foresee a proposal similar to the Premier League’s infamous 39th game serving as a legacy plan. OC US soccer players will overplay their hand Unbeknownst to many sports pundits, soccer federations are responsible for building the game in all its forms, from the grassroots upward, not just paying the men’s and women’s able-bodied full-field World Cup teams. The women’s team should have settled its “equal pay” dispute years ago but persists in pushing forward in court, where its case is flawed. The men’s team has paid lip service to “equal pay”, but the federation has called its bluff by insisting upon some way to figure out how to disperse World Cup prize money that’s far greater for men than for women – to Fifa’s disgrace. (Other countries have “equal pay” by offering the teams equal percentages of World Cup prize money, a solution that would make the US women’s team laugh.) These teams will reach a point at which they can’t just play on the sympathies of the misinformed, and they’ll end up negotiating from a position of weakness. BD The much-talked-about NBA in-season tournament goes up in smoke Compared to his peers, Adam Silver has had a relatively uncontroversial reign as NBA commissioner, however, his obsession with shortening the regular season in place of an in-season tournament feels like an all-time example of a person with power attempting to fix the unbroken. While recently leaked news suggests that opposition to the play-in tournament is lowering, it wouldn’t be at all surprising for there to be swift backlash, either from the players’ union, the owners or both. 2022 could very well bring us the most significant defeat of Silver’s tenure.

6133;6133;Haiti’s New Year’s Day soup has made headlines. But let’s not be naive about its symbolism;2022-01-01T09:15:44Z;['N/A'];['Haiti', 'Global development', 'Inequality', 'Americas', 'World news', 'Food', 'Soup', 'New year'];"Whispers. Curfews. Never-ending military parades and shows of arms. Opponents’ bodies exposed for children to see as some sort of macabre art. And always, that nasal voice of “Papa Doc”, François Duvalier, chanting on all radio stations. Those were the days of my childhood under a dictator in Haiti. But on 1 January, Independence Day, there were three things that made a difference. Children in domestic service would visit their godmother and godfathers’ houses, where an envelope containing a few piastres (money) was waiting for them, probably the only gift they would receive during the year. Patriotic verses and folkloric songs slipped into the official ceremonies. A touch of art between long and scary diatribes against “the enemy” and unconditional pledges of allegiance to the “chief”. The third was the “joumou”, a soup traditionally shared on the first day of a new year. At the time, the soup only meant to me that my parents had not made new friends. The same faces were invited to eat it together every year: a very tall judge, a one-eyed lawyer who claimed to be able to communicate with the dead, and selected members of the larger family. When I was old enough to invite people to my place to share the 1 January soup joumou, I realised it was a difficult decision. I too had a very short list of people, with few changes from one year to another. I became my parents – no new friends, which was understandable if by “friends” one means people with whom you have shared ordeals and hopes, in the company of whom you feel not only happy but safe. Soup joumou, even for a confirmed atheist, is the centre of a sacred gathering. It would be among your worst memories to remember you shared the soup joumou with someone who was, in fact, a traitor. Between eight and 10 in the morning when it is served, soup joumou is a symbol of what we, as Haitians, bring to the world. Against the savagery of colonialism and modern slavery, we created Haiti, our language, and with it goods, ideas, ways of being, art and artefacts. What is soup joumou to me personally? I do not ask myself. The great poet René Philoctète wrote a beautiful poem about the questions he does not ask himself: “why I stay here, why I do the things I do”. The answer is too simple: because that is the way of being myself. Without my soup joumou, I would feel odd or incomplete.
Now that everybody seems to want to talk about soup joumou, since its international recognition, the lack of confirmed historical references about its origins leaves the door open to recreations of the beginning of the tradition. But one thing, at least, is for sure – lots of Haitians, descendants of its creators, cannot afford it. We should not forget that the elites and oligarchies – with the complicity of dominant capitalist states – derailed a revolution of modern times and made of Haiti a country in which social injustice, economic exploitation and cultural exclusion prevails. Let us not be naive and make soup joumou the symbol of a togetherness that barely exists. The soup is waiting, but a true national feast celebrating equality among Haitians is yet to come. • Lyonel Trouillot is a Haitian novelist and poet";https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/01/haitis-new-years-day-soup-joumou-has-made-headlines-but-lets-not-be-naive-about-its-symbolism
6134;6134;‘Many hold Gove responsible’: education guru sets out what’s wrong with England’s schools;2022-01-01T09:00:45Z;['Fiona Millar'];['Schools', 'Education policy', 'Education', 'Books', 'Politics', 'Michael Gove', 'England'];"The veteran educationist Sir Tim Brighouse is in an optimistic mood. This may be a period of “doubt and disillusion”, especially as Covid threatens to disrupt another school year, but in his view such times inevitably lead to change. With that in mind, he has just co-authored a sweeping 600-page overview of modern education policy, with suggestions he hopes will contribute to a new direction. Written with the curriculum expert Mick Waters, About Our Schools divides recent history into two eras: a postwar age of “hope and optimism”, in which teachers were pretty free to do what they liked, followed by a post-Thatcher age of “markets, centralisation and managerialism”, in which the influence of inspections and league tables became all-pervasive and individual ministers could decide how skills such as subtraction should be taught in every classroom in England. The language used to describe the two ages is so leading that you could be forgiven for thinking Brighouse was a fully paid-up member of what the former education secretary Michael Gove, who straddles the book like a malign colossus, used to dismiss as “the blob”, after a 1958 science fiction film in which a gelatinous life form (in this case the progressive education establishment) engulfs everything it touches. But he is adamant that he would fit into either age. “I don’t want anyone thinking we are just romantic oldies looking back at a forgotten period,” he says. “Many good things about that postwar period were poor. Teaching wasn’t good enough and there was a less clear definition of what a good school was.
“But reforms that helped to bring improvement have been poisoned by over-emphasis on autonomy and a devil-take-the-hindmost approach. Accountability has gone too far and become punitive.” His own professional life is steeped in the old local education authority model – he was chief education officer (when such things existed) in Birmingham and Oxfordshire. He also led the London Challenge, arguably one of the most successful education initiatives of the past three decades, and was a reformer who published exam results in Oxfordshire well before they were a national reality. But, as the book painstakingly points out, schools in England now have too much central government control, an incoherent jumble of different academy chains and local authorities, exams with grading systems designed to write off a significant minority of children as failures, undervalued technical and vocational education, inadequate support for children with special needs, and performance measures that incentivise unethical behaviour, in particular exclusion and “off-rolling” of the most vulnerable pupils. It’s an accurate and disturbing picture – and should be a call to arms for anyone genuinely interested in effective policy-making. Brighouse and Waters’ numerous solutions, which range from taxing private schools – to subsidise poorer children’s education – to cracking down on admissions and exclusions “dirty tricks” and coaxing every school into some sort of local partnership trust (which sounds suspiciously like the mass academisation plan that had to be ditched by the Lib-Con coalition government), are logical and radical – so much so they seem unlikely to catch on, although Labour, with its current policy vacuum, might take note. Attempting to tease out why such sensible and fair policy ideas may never see the light of day should be the question of the moment. The book sheds light on this, too, thanks to interviews with most of the education secretaries of the past three decades, plus a handful of Ofsted chiefs.
The problem is politics. When the former Labour prime minister Jim Callaghan made his famous Ruskin speech in 1976 challenging the lack of accountability in education, in effect the starting point of reform, the secretary of state had only three powers over schools. Today he or she has more than 2,500. Thousands of schools are now run from Whitehall through academy chains. Little real autonomy exists at a local level, and every head is at the mercy of whoever is in power and the appetite of Downing Street for dramatic change. So much so, that some professional interviewees were reluctant to be quoted for fear of the consequences. The average life span of an education secretary is just over two years – enough time for a few “launches and logos”, according to the authors – and this has inevitably led to most simply tinkering with the direction of travel of their predecessors. As the former Labour education secretary Charles Clarke explains, “realpolitik” interferes; ideas get abandoned or shoved into a “too difficult box” to be left to a successor, who then works through the same cycle. Dealing with the archaic system of grammar schools and the 11-plus test is just one example of this. And while some education secretaries – such as Ken Baker, who ushered in an era of choice, league tables and inspections; David Blunkett, with his drive on standards; and Ed Balls, who widened his department’s focus to include children and families as well as schools – made a tangible difference, none really questioned the underlying problems with the system. Talking to them for the book, “very few regretted anything they had done,” says Brighouse. “Most regretted things they hadn’t done and that they didn’t have more power. While all agreed that schools should be vehicles for greater equity, equality and social mobility, a lack of agreement about the purpose of schooling makes it very hard to define what those aims actually mean in practice.”
And then there is Michael Gove. Even though he only answered questions from the authors in writing, and did express regret for the way he cancelled the Building Schools for the Future programme in 2010, the anecdotes of others are littered with his influence. Whether it is Gove’s own assertion that “there is no such thing as a smooth revolution” (reform is by necessity untidy), or his former adviser Sam Freedman’s regret that more consensus was impossible because of Gove’s (and no doubt Dominic Cummings’s) penchant for waging a public fight in the media, or the former Ofsted chief inspector Michael Wilshaw recounting that Gove did not want local authorities inspected because he wanted them to “wither on the vine”, Gove’s legacy is everywhere. It has not been a positive one, conclude the authors. “Many people interviewed for the book hold Gove responsible for some of the fundamental problems with schooling today – the fractured system, high exclusions and unsuitable curriculum,” they write. These are all problems Brighouse and Waters would seek to address at a post-Covid moment when people are yearning for what they describe as a “a new educational age – a time of hope, ambition and collaboration”.
But how to translate that yearning into real policy change? The book contains a telling anecdote from Brighouse’s days as the London schools commissioner, when he was asked by the then prime minister, Tony Blair, if there was anything he wanted to add to the London Challenge prospectus. Brighouse’s suggestion that they should include something about the chaotic state of secondary school admissions in the capital was “greeted with an audible silence”, after which, he admits, he backed off the subject. “I have no idea how often I spoke truth to power; I am not sure I did enough. I didn’t fight hard enough over admissions, and I am conscious now that I should have done more,” he says. “I have never felt that I am pleased with what I have achieved because we didn’t address admissions or exclusions and you see the results of that now in the children who are effectively forgotten by the system.” This may explain why, amid all the “building back better” policy solutions that the book suggests, he instantly settles on a plan for the “open school”, a parallel version of the Open University, as his top priority. The open school would build on the pandemic’s lessons about digital learning and create a national virtual school to help offset disadvantage, include children who are out of school, and provide enhanced opportunities for all. It would wrap around a system guided by very different principles from the ones we see today: a new consensus on the purpose of schooling, a national cross-party commission to take a balanced 10-year view of education policy, schools being judged in groups rather than alone, with inclusion and wellbeing incentivised as well as exam results. Naturally there would be an enhanced role for the local authorities, which would be responsible for holding the new partnerships to account, in effect restraining central government power. Brighouse’s optimism is rooted in the parallels he sees between the moment of Callaghan’s Ruskin speech, a crucial starting point of the book’s journey, and today. “Everyone knew something had to change but it took a decade before the ideas were shaped into the 1988 Education Act,” he says. “Change comes from a conjunction of individuals, ideas and an environment that is conducive,” he suggests, pointing to an example from his own local community about how this might work in practice. His wife, Liz, has long been an Oxfordshire county councillor and is now part of the Fair Deal Alliance, a coalition cabinet of Labour, Liberal Democrats and the Greens. In his fantasy future he sees a closer alliance between the opposition parties in favour of electoral reform and consensus on some big policy ideas, hopefully including some from the book. “Today feels like 1976 when Callaghan made his speech. It took time, but change came in the end and this moment feels very similar, so even if it takes five to 10 years, we will have been happy to give these ideas a push and contributed to that.” • About Our Schools by Tim Brighouse and Mick Waters will be published on 7 January 2022 by Crown House";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/sir-tim-brighouse-many-hold-gove-responsible-expert-educator-sets-out-whats-gone-wrong-with-britains-schools
6135;6135;Send us your questions for Johnny Marr;2022-01-01T09:00:45Z;['Kitty Empire'];['Johnny Marr', 'Music', 'Culture', 'Pop and rock'];Four decades into a career as deep and arpeggiated as it has been long, self-taught guitarist Johnny Marr is currently in the midst of a flurry of EP releases – Fever Dreams Pts 1-4, set to be compiled as a double album in February. Since revolutionising the guitar band with his trademark ringing melodies in the Smiths in the 1980s, the prolific guitarist – born Johnny Maher – has rarely paused to retune. Alongside his solo output, Marr has also been one of the most fervent collaborators of his generation, doing time in bands including Modest Mouse and the Cribs, as well as his own outfit, the Healers, and Electronic with fellow Mancunian Bernard Sumner. Pals with Pet Shop Boys and au fait with Oasis, he worked on the score for Inception. Earlier this year Marr collaborated with Hans Zimmer – and Billie Eilish – on the Bond soundtrack, and next year he is set to tour with Blondie. Marr’s status as one of the most original electric guitarists of our time is, of course, laid atop a solid grounding in British folk, best seen in his work with the late Bert Jansch. This is your chance to quiz Marr. Perhaps: does being a straight-edge vegan help with his extraordinary work rate?

6136;6136;Escape your comfort zone: I can’t ride a bike, drive a car or swim. Can I learn to rollerskate?;2022-01-01T09:00:45Z;['Yomi Adegoke'];['Life and style'];I consider myself to be “transportationally challenged” – that is to say, I can’t drive a car, ride a bike, ice-skate, ski or swim (at least not in a way that doesn’t endanger others, given my aggressively flailing limbs). Any method of moving from one place to another aside from walking eludes me. It’s probably no surprise to hear that I can’t rollerskate, either. To me, rollerskating borders on black magic. I watch in awe as pros pull off precarious moves with the nonchalance of someone taking a stroll to the corner shop. It’s an enviable, effortless kind of cool, exemplified by the Berlin-based rollerskater Oumi Janta, whose videos went viral during lockdown. Last June, she posted a clip on Instagram that featured her rollerskating while dancing – backwards. It garnered more than 2.9m views and helped launch a cabal of rollerskating influencers. Google searches for “rollerskates” had already started to rise, with global searches for the word increasing by 77% between March and May 2020, when, months later, the fourth season of The Crown furthered the fervour with scenes of Diana, Princess of Wales whizzing her way through Buckingham Palace. So when thinking about how to escape my comfort zone, I plumped for the activity that had the potential to make me look the most stupid, but also, if I managed to pull it off, the coolest. I arrive at Roller Nation in north London on a damp and dreary afternoon, desperate to get my rollerskating lesson over and done with. Glimpsing knee pads on a table as I step inside, I am struck with thoughts of how inevitable it is that I’ll fall over, but my nerves are soon calmed by the venue’s sparkling disco balls and my unnaturally patient instructor, Nele, the founder of the rollerskating school Isle of Skating in London. My first topple comes about six minutes in and means Nele takes me back to basics, teaching me how to fall correctly – which is harder than it sounds. The trick is to land on your knees, rather than your bum. Having perfected the art of falling over, I feel slightly less worried about the likelihood of having to leave the venue on a stretcher. I am ready for more. The second rule of skating, it seems, is multitasking: something else I’m notoriously bad at. Keeping your feet in, knees low, chest high, bum low, and arms in, while propelling yourself forward by shifting your weight from side to side is … difficult. All the while, you must avoid looking at your feet – Nele takes to asking me how many fingers she’s holding up, in order to stop me gazing at the floor and, ultimately, falling towards it. After many unsteady laps around the rink, walking like a penguin on my skates with Nele holding my hand, I am surprised to see I am absentmindedly skating solo. Who would have thought the phrase “practice makes perfect” might have some truth to it? Leaving my comfort zone wasn’t exactly painless – I’m still nursing a bruised arm – but it was worth it. I probably won’t be signing up to a roller derby or showing off my moves at a roller disco just yet, but I wholly intend to keep learning. I leave feeling buoyed up by the experience and hoping that, next summer, I might finally have the confidence to take on my lifelong enemy: the bicycle.;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/escape-your-comfort-zone-i-cant-ride-a-bike-drive-a-car-or-swim-can-i-learn-to-rollerskate

6141;6141;Veganuary set to pass 2m milestone as more firms join movement;2022-01-01T09:00:44Z;['Zoe Wood'];['Veganism', 'Life and style', 'UK news', 'Business'];A record number of people are expected to try to eat only plant-based foods this month as growing concern about the climate crisis heightens interest in the Veganuary movement. The global campaign is gathering momentum as more large employers promote it internally. This year, Harrods, Superdrug and Volkswagen UK are among the big names taking part in the Veganuary “workplace challenge” for the first time. The corporate push involves making more vegan food available at work as well as running education and morale-boosting events to help participants keep going throughout the month. More than 500,000 people signed up to take part in last year’s Veganuary, about a quarter of whom – 125,000 – were based in the UK. However, the campaign’s research suggests that potentially 10 times as many people participate and a significant number continue with plant-based diets beyond the end of the month. By the end of January, Veganuary expects to have reached the milestone of 2 million participants since its launch in 2014. It passed 1 million sign-ups in October 2020. A YouGov poll of 2,079 UK adults for Veganuary found 4% planned to participate. Extrapolated to all UK adults, that would equate to 2.7 million people. The survey found that attitudes towards veganism had become more positive over the past two years, with 36% describing it as an “admirable thing to do”. Veganuary’s Toni Vernelli said that 20 years ago if people said they were vegan, others would think it was a “weird thing to do” or “quite extreme”. “Now the first thing people say is ‘oh, I’m really cutting back on my meat and dairy consumption,’ and nine times out of 10 the reason is the environment.” At the same time, going vegan is not the food-eliminating challenge it once was. There has been a gold rush in the food industry with investors pouring billions into alt-meat and dairy brands, a trend that has resulted in thousands of new products including high-profile innovations such as plant-based bars of Cadbury Dairy Milk. With more than 50,000 products certified by the Vegan Society, there has been no let-up before the 2022 campaign, with a welter of treats arriving on supermarket shelves and menus in the coming days. A number of the most anticipated launches can be found in the cheese aisle. A vegan Babybel, made out of coconut oil and starch and wrapped in green rather than the brand’s trademark red wax, will make its debut. An almond- and oat-based Philadelphia spread is also coming. Forty-two companies in the UK have signed up to the workplace challenge this year, including Marks & Spencer, the professional services firms PwC and EY, and the insurer Hastings Direct. Cian O’Brien, the director of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles UK, said the company was focused on becoming more sustainable, and that went beyond its work on electrification. “Sustainability is broader and the opportunity to make a personal contribution through changing our habits has to be explored,” he said. Vernelli said it was important for business leaders to “set the tone”. “Our meat and dairy consumption is not sustainable and the leaders in our society have to take action on this. By taking part in the workplace challenge, they’re not only publicly showing their commitment to sustainability, but also to their staff and leading by example,” she said. “I’m think it is incredible to have someone like Harrods taking part,” she added. “It shows that veganism cuts across all demographics. It isn’t a leftwing or rightwing thing or a class thing. We’ve got participants and businesses across all the whole spectrum.”;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/veganuary-set-to-pass-2m-milestone-as-more-firms-join-movement

6143;6143;The Language of Love: the absurd dating show that will save your January;2022-01-01T08:00:45Z;['Joel Golby'];['Television & radio', 'Culture', 'Television', 'Davina McCall'];If you pay close enough attention you will notice that there are only three types of dating show: “laughs”, “influence” and “genuinely wanting romance”. The first category, laughs, barely counts: participants on these one-episode dating shows are rarely in it for anything other than a story, ironically enough to use as a conversation starter on subsequent, untelevised dates – “An interesting fact about me? Oh, uh: my episode of Dinner Date is still available on ITV Hub for the next 19 days”, “Ah, yeah? I got sent home after the penis round on Naked Attraction”. Second is the blockbuster dating format, where everyone entering a villa half-hopes not for love but for a significant uptick in Instagram followers and the offer to open a shop in a local mall for a head-spinning amount of cash. These shows litter our screens in the summer months – a Love Island, an Ex on the Beach, a Ready to Mingle. (Play the game right and you can enter the Love Island villa at the start of the summer and leave the Celebs Go Dating villa at the end of the following winter.) Then you get what Channel 4 excels in: taking people who are 30 or almost 30 or a bit past 30, and all emotionally damaged by something in their romantic history, and throwing them into a speculative dating show that, if sociologists enacted it in the 60s, we’d be talking about now in the hushed tones we use when we mention the Stanford prison experiment. Anyway: welcome to The Language of Love (Channel 4, Tuesday, 10pm). It is exactly as ridiculous as it sounds: six lovelorn Brits do their little pre-roll interviews saying they’ve tried everything and they just can’t find the missing piece, all they want is love, and they’re willing to travel to the Costa del Sol to find it, and blah blah blah blah blah. Then they get on a rickety coach and exchange tentative banter with each other (lads blasting the question “OI, WHAT’S YOUR TYPE?” at each other like a football) as it winds up a hill. Then Davina McCall pops out, the pedigree presenter to end all other presenters, and tells them: you’ve all tried everything, you all failed to find the missing piece, you all want love and, guess what, today you’re going to find it. But guess what guess what: none of the sexy singles we’re going to introduce you to can speak English, and none of you can speak Spanish. You have to negotiate heavy petting with the same staccato elan you use to order an omelette at a Tenerife hotel. Channel 4 more than any British channel understands the need to fill January, the most miserable of months, with a captivatingly absurd dating show. This is how they got me hooked on Married at First Sight: Australia last year. (What else was I going to do? I’d spent all my Christmas money and I wasn’t drinking.) The Language of Love seems similarly primed for an audience of people who can’t legally leave the house for whatever reason. As a result, I’m already resigned to watching it to the bitter end. After the initial group meetings between the Spanish boys and the British girls, you think: “How fun can this be, really? They keep misunderstanding each other. Nobody knows how to count. This is stupid.” Then, a banquet-style paella meal and some sangria jugs later, and the electric crackle of human chemistry is somehow overriding the language barrier, and you’re engrossed. Kimey, a medical student, is infatuated with Akonne, a surprisingly sweethearted Brummie MMA fighter. Tracy and Thalia are squabbling over the same hotel worker. The whole thing seems to be filmed on the exact same hardware they use for the grainy interior shots of First Dates Hotel, so you keep expecting Fred to turn up. Instead, as Davina and co-host Ricky Merino watch from a distant balcony, you actually spy something darker and more primal: the inherent human impulse to try to get off with someone even if you can’t confidently tell them where the library is. It doesn’t make sense that this show is as good as it is, but then it doesn’t make sense that any human would spend a fortnight trying to forge a horny lingua franca just because Davina McCall told them to, and yet here we are. This is what your January looks like. Staring into the abyss of the human condition and seeing just how deep it can go.;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/01/the-language-of-love-the-absurd-dating-show-that-will-save-your-january
6144;6144;Specs appeal: what’s the best way to apply make up as a glasses wearer?;2022-01-01T08:00:45Z;['Sali Hughes'];['Makeup'];"Like every other spectacles wearer I know, I’m adamant that my prescription has deteriorated disproportionately during the pandemic. Where forgetting my glasses was once a mere inconvenience, it’s now a crisis that forces me home to retrieve them. It’s been an interesting process, beauty-wise – what one gains in not being able to see gaping pores, one loses in the ability to apply a straight swoosh of liner. Sight isn’t the only consideration. Specs cast a shadow (anti-reflective coating helps), so concealer has to work harder to brighten dark circles (I use Dior Forever Correct, £27), and thick frames can obscure hard work done on eyeshadow, which can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on the application. For days when my glasses will be on and off as often as a teenage romance (I wear a librarian’s chain from Missoma), I want eye makeup to be simple but noticeable. The solution almost always comes via a crayon. By far the easiest eyeshadow with a tremendous effort/effect ratio, crayons are a must for specs wearers. The bullet shape means that even an approximate aim lands on target. After drawing creamy colour on to the lid, I simply take a clean, fluffy brush and soften the edges. The technique is foolproof. For years, Bobbi Brown made the only great crayons (Long-Wear Cream Shadow Sticks, £25, are still the longest-lasting), but I’ve diversified to include Vieve’s Eye Wands, £21, which fill some gaps in the Bobbi shade lineup. Vieve’s Sand, a pale, warm nude, is a no-brainer lid colour on lighter skins, and a terrific brow bone highlighter on darker tones. Camel and Hazelnut are warm, neutral nudes that work on everyone (more shades coming this month).
Perhaps prompted by the threat to its monopoly on crayons, Bobbi Brown has introduced some delicious new shades, too. Cashew and Shore are two endlessly useful neutrals (warm and cool, respectively) and Skyward is a universally flattering metallic chartreuse for more playful looks. All can be swiped underneath the eye and smudged in the same way, which helps enormously if your eyes appear to recede behind your glasses, as mine do.
What has become absolutely crucial over time is a SimpleHuman sensor mirror (£290).

6145;6145;New year, same old you! The secret to self-improvement is embracing your messy, imperfect life;2022-01-01T08:00:45Z;['Oliver Burkeman'];['Health & wellbeing', 'Culture', 'Psychology', 'New year', 'Life and style'];"It’s the time of year for reinventions – or, perhaps more accurately, preparing for reinventions. For buying the diet book, drawing up the new morning routine, bookmarking the therapists’ websites or purchasing the storage cabinets for the soon-to-be-perfectly-organised house. As with all attempts at personal transformation, at new year or otherwise, this is the fun part. You get to experience all the excitement of becoming an entirely different person, without having yet had to put in the effort – and without having failed. Like untrodden early morning snow, the vision of who you’ll become remains pristine. Usually, though, something inside you knows the truth: in a few days’ time, the whole thing will have turned into unpleasant grey slush. Personal reinventions fail partly for the obvious reasons: you set your goals too high; or your existing obligations at work or home get in the way; or you find (who could have imagined it?) that the unimpressive level of self-discipline you’ve demonstrated for your entire life until this moment can’t magically be tripled overnight. But there’s also a deeper problem with quests for wholesale transformation, which explains why they rarely work as intended – and why, as 2022 begins, embracing the existing version of yourself, with all its messiness and imperfections, might be the most transformative thing you’ve ever done.
The core of the trouble is that schemes for constructing a New You – whether in every area of life, or just one major one, such as your relationship with your children, or your physical fitness – are always devised by the Old You, who by their own admission has some pretty glaring issues. (Otherwise why would you bother to envision a new one?) You’ve got no good reason to trust this dubious character’s thoughts about reinvention; indeed, it’s likely they’re using what looks like “reinvention” to reinforce old hang-ups instead. And so, for example, your vow to become more productive this year might just stem from your old belief that you’re obliged to fulfil every demand made by those around you, when a better way forward might be to start strategically letting a few people down. Likewise, your intention to make this the year you find your soulmate might simply represent your conviction that you don’t have what it takes to cope on your own. Even if it works, the so-called reinvention will only end up entrenching the status quo. “No one awakens in the morning, looks in the mirror and says, ‘I think I will repeat my mistakes today’ or, ‘I expect today I will do something stupid, repetitive, regressive and against my best interests,’” writes the Jungian psychoanalyst James Hollis. “But frequently, this replication of history is precisely what we do.”
One consequence is that while you’ll fail to pull off a total transformation of your personality – that would entail the impossible feat of somehow jumping outside your own life – you probably will end up feeling worse about the life you have. “Focusing your mind on an imagined future where you’re someone different makes your now-self inevitably ‘less-than’,” says Jocelyn K Glei, host of the Hurry Slowly podcast, who recommends using the new year to take stock of the preceding year’s transformations instead. The alternative to reinvention – making a wholehearted commitment to accepting who you already are – is liable to sound horribly cheesy, or at best like a matter of settling for a mediocre life. But as the celebrated psychologist Carl Rogers famously noted, the very opposite is the case: “The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.” When you no longer imagine you must transform yourself, in order to justify your existence on the planet, you’re finally able to do so, in small ways and large. The stakes are lower, now that your self-worth no longer hangs in the balance.
“There’s a quiet power in forgiving our flaws, missteps and perceived shortcomings,” says Madeleine Dore, author of I Didn’t Do the Thing Today: Letting Go of Productivity Guilt, out this month. “Often when we accept ourselves, we’re more likely to get the best from ourselves, because we’re better placed to look at what we need to thrive, rather than change.” The psychotherapist Bruce Tift suggests a thought experiment: imagine whatever issue you struggle with now – the trait in yourself you wish you didn’t possess, the behaviour in which you wish you didn’t engage – persisting to the very end of your days. What if you’ll always be something of a procrastinator? What if you never entirely lose your tendency to lash out at others when upset at yourself?
When I run this experiment on myself, I feel deflated at first. Hold on – you mean I’ll never get to the part of life that’s problem-free? But then comes a sense of a burden being lifted. What a relief: I get to drop that stupid fantasy and focus on the real world, which is where real changes can happen. The self-help writer Mark Manson describes how this might work in the context of social anxiety: “Paradoxically, accepting that you’re just not a confident person and you’re always going to feel a little off around other people will begin to make you feel more comfortable and less anxious around others. You won’t judge yourself, and then you’ll feel less judged by them as well.” There’s a kind of defeat that needs accepting here: a willingness to concede that, by the perfectionistic standards to which you’ve been holding yourself, you have already failed. There’s no going back. You’ll never unwaste the time you tell yourself you’ve wasted, or undo the bad things you’ve done. Which is great, because it means you get to stop trying to evade the unavoidable mess of existence and get stuck in to a few worthwhile and pleasurable activities instead. The Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki nailed the matter when he told his students: “Each of you is perfect just as you are – and you could all use improvement.” Yes, it’s a paradox. You’ll just have to deal with that, too.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/new-year-same-old-you-the-secret-to-self-improvement-is-embracing-your-messy-imperfect-life
6146;6146;Boris Johnson quits as world runs out of Greek letters? Our supporters’ predictions for 2022;2022-01-01T08:00:44Z;['Mark Rice-Oxley'];['World news'];"Boris Johnson steps down, to be replaced by David Frost – or Jeremy Hunt, or Michael Gove, or Peppa Pig. French presidential elections are beset by civil unrest over pandemic restrictions. Russia mounts some kind of incursion in eastern Ukraine. China waits for an opportune moment to overrun Taiwan. And the world runs out of Greek letters to attach to Covid variants. Yes, it’s the time for pundits and predictions – a new year stretching ahead and no shortage of views on what it will deliver. Some things seem dead certs: elections in Brazil, the US, Hungary and France. A new Covid wave to grapple with. A platinum jubilee. A controversial World Cup – and Winter Olympics. But what about the unknown unknowns? We asked the Guardian’s 1 million supporters to make their predictions. The picture painted by a colourful spray of submissions was an alternative foretelling of the year ahead – and not hugely cheerful. Geopolitically, Ukraine and Taiwan seem most vulnerable, but there were also predictions of showdowns in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ethiopia and Iran, of something stirring on Russia’s border with the Baltic republics, and of deepening hunger in Afghanistan and parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Donald Trump declares for the 2024 presidential race after the Republicans wrest back control of Congress; but populists and the far right fall into retreat elsewhere.
Everyone will have slightly more money – but that’s just another way of saying inflation will march upwards. Higher interest rates cause consumer pain around the world, and a Chinese property market collapse has a palpable financial impact. Food shortages bite. The UK government has to nationalise electricity provision, amid the wretched decay of privatised industries struggling with underinvestment. Businesses pursue purpose and sustainability like never before, mindful this is the best way to retain fleet-footed talent. An incipient desertion of Facebook and Twitter becomes a proper exodus; cryptocurrencies collapse in value faced with the twin threats of regulation and the issue of official digital currencies. Airports, supermarkets and lampposts become EV charging hubs. Gigabattery is voted word of the year, just ahead of microbiome, plyscraper, nanodrone and wolf warrior. There will be digital daemons for all. Rain patterns change and there are further startling weather events in unexpected parts. A cyberattack causes major infrastructure disruption. Billions of trees are planted, but not all of them in the right places. Horses are increasingly used as a method of transport.
Assisted dying becomes bigger business than ever, as planned death becomes something of a performance. There is a backlash against the availability of online pornography as a new social division emerges between sybarites and prudes. Fertility rates plummet amid a crisis over sperm counts. Overall, it will be a marginally better year than 2021. A survey of supporters found 50.5% optimistic about the new year, compared with 49.5% who were pessimistic. A selection of supporters’ predictions for 2022 Europe will be facing two tricky crises: the refugee situation in Belarus and newly sparked tensions in Serbia, both potential candidates for another war in Europe. Extreme civil unrest due to the harsh Covid restrictions imposed by the governments. War between the US and China over Taiwan. Christine Brösenhuber Horses will begin to be used for travel and will appear in towns and cities. To enable this to happen, horse parks will be provided where owners can safely leave their horses while they pop to the shops, go to work, nip to the GP ... Horses run on grass – it makes so much sense. Penny Nicholson Prediction of a repeat of the 1920s following the Spanish flu pandemic ... if it is correct it will result in increase in social disease, alcoholism and drug taking ... others much more relaxed will reap the benefits of an alternate life Covid-19 allowed them to see. Elaine Hasty
You’ll be able to personalise the sound of your electric car and the streets will become a cacophony of Clash meets Tchaikovsky. You’ll be able to select your own online daemon to accompany you to online office meetings: it will sit in the corner of your screen and scratch, titter, scowl, chuck pips etc while you nod seriously at your boss. Insects will be the new crisps, until people realise how gross insect farming is. Coralie Wilson We’ll start to see a more purpose-orientated approach in business and in working life. The “great resignation” has encouraged many people to seek out work that feels personally meaningful to them, and I expect this trend will continue in 2022. As employees start to realign their working lives around a sense of personal meaning, it will eventually become clear to employers that purpose is a priority. This will encourage business owners and leaders to take a more intentional approach to strategy and management, figuring out what they can offer their employees and stakeholders, and working to make a meaningful impact in the world. Eloise Skinner Enough people will leave Facebook and Twitter to make them unviable. Nick Jones There will be bigger splits across society with those vaccinated v anti-vaxxers. This will lead to further disinformation and probably further violence and inequalities across society especially where compulsory vaccines are introduced. Gerry Lee
Macron will be re-elected. A definite 55% of Scottish yes for independence. A fourth dose of vaccine starting in May. The relationship between France and the UK will turn even sourer. Anna-Laure Damongeot I see two major universal trends. The first that one half of the population of human beings of this world will evolve into a kinder and more generous species, grateful to have survived the worst existential crisis in our recent history. The other half, which has sunk into an alternative reality of viewing fellow people as enemies of their race, will have a rude awakening and lose considerable ground because their own clans will desert them even as their predictions keep getting exposed as hate and not facts. Aruna Hariharan A growing youth movement of authentic and knowledgeable activists who demand transformative change in our governance systems. Steve Martin Sinn Féin/Alliance form Northern Ireland government at Stormont in May causing civil war in the Conservative party as their negotiating stance on the NI protocol with Europe collapses. Further Brexit issues with border controls and supply chain problems ramp up the pressure on Johnson. He does not rise to the challenge and further infighting results in a leadership challenge. Paul Collins Julian Assange freed and allowed to return to Australia with his wife and two sons. Mariam Dessaive I predict that Boris will further seek to weasel his way out of No 10 because he doesn’t like being PM when it’s difficult. Kathy Duggan A major crypto crash, perhaps because of regulatory crackdowns and/or the introduction of one or more official digital currencies. Geoff Barnard A significant decline of the far right in many countries. A bigger “normality” of our lives facing Covid-19 (vaccination and weaker variants). A more severe crisis between western countries and China and Russia. Luiz Bastos I think that countries where there’s no free speech, a lot of corruption, poverty and very high Covid deaths will face big trouble (India, Egypt, Iran, even maybe Russia and China), if not in 2022 then in the next 10 years. Erika Claus Petiot Due to political embarrassment of stories of exploitation of overseas workers in Qatar, Fifa moves World Cup location to the more sensitive choice of Saudi Arabia, only after Belarus turned down the opportunity. Patrick Brosnan With four major Covid-19 variants in two years we can expect another two in 2022. Could be more with the lack of take-up of vaccines worldwide. Eventually, we’ll run out of Greek letters. Dave Bartlett There will be a series of scandals of older vulnerable people coming to significant harm as a result of the lack of social care availability. Peter Loose We’ll all move to the Orkneys to soak up the surplus electricity. As a result there will be a run on warm clothing especially puffer jackets. As a result of that the eider duck population will crash. Jane Edmonds While the west is distracted by further Covid outbreaks, Russia invades Ukraine and China attacks Taiwan – simultaneously. The west subsequently does not know which way to turn. George Stephens China will begin to take serious measures on climate emissions, and Australia and Canada’s fossil industries will suffer accordingly. Norm Mohamid There will be a major disruption caused either by a cyberattack or by failure of GPS – caused by a large solar storm or a system problem. We have become far too dependent on technology that is vulnerable to widespread failure. Martyn Thomas More people than ever will give up on the US and Canadian costs of living and move to Mexico and Panama. Suzanne Gravelle 2022 is going to be significantly worse even than 2021 and 2020. Large increases in the price of food, fuel, energy, hospitality. Maybe even food shortages. More extreme weather events, including more, and worse, in the UK. Terrifying clampdowns on freedom of speech and the right to protest – eg “protesters” being imprisoned for sharing views and communicating with each other online. And who knows what is going to happen with Covid? The shocking thing is that, even with 2020 and 2021 being as awful as they have been, they are better than any year we’ll see for the rest of our lives. Cathy Eastburn The Covid variants will have to be named in Sanskrit, after we run out of Greek letters. Mike Allen I hate to say this, but there will be an increase in tensions over the Ukraine, Taiwan, and Iran’s nuclear programme. This will not be triumph of the west. The US will retreat from these facedown, and Ukraine will fall into the orbit of Russia, Taiwan will fall to China, without a fight, at the early signs of invasion, and Iran will find itself on the receiving end of Israeli attacks on its nuclear programme. Whether it retaliates effectively, along with its allies Hezbollah and to a lesser extant Hamas, will determine Israel’s fate. The 2022 elections in the US will lead to a return to Republican majorities in both ouses. Harry Rajchgot The Queen abdicates, Charles sees the light and decides to retire to his potting shed, William stands down for the sake of his family, Harry says “no way”, everyone else in line looks the other way … and a republic is declared.

6147;6147;January transfer window: guide to every Premier League club’s plans;2022-01-01T08:00:44Z;['Guardian sport'];['Transfer window', 'Football', 'Sport', 'Arsenal', 'Brentford', 'Aston Villa', 'Brighton & Hove Albion', 'Burnley', 'Chelsea', 'Crystal Palace', 'Everton', 'Leeds United', 'Leicester City', 'Liverpool', 'Manchester City', 'Manchester United', 'Newcastle United', 'Norwich City', 'Southampton', 'Tottenham Hotspur', 'Watford', 'West Ham United', 'Wolverhampton Wanderers'];"Arsenal Mikel Arteta is eager to fine-tune a squad that looks increasingly capable of a top-four push but may have to wheel and deal. He would like to address a lack of depth in midfield, perhaps using the sale of Ainsley Maitland-Niles to part-fund any signing, while Nicolas Pépé’s future is uncertain so a right-sided forward may be on the agenda. Arsenal need a new long-term option at centre-forward, too, but even if Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is frozen out for good that is likelier to be addressed in the summer. Budget Will be sales-dependent but could reach £30m. Nick Ames
Aston Villa Steven Gerrard is expected to be backed in his first window in charge. A defensive-minded midfielder is high on Gerrard’s wishlist after Marvelous Nakamba suffered a knee injury which may rule him out for the rest of the season, while reinforcements at full-back are also wanted. The Southampton midfielder Oriol Romeu was tracked in the summer, as was his club-mate, James Ward-Prowse. Villa have been linked with moves for the Liverpool defender Joe Gomez, and Glen Kamara, who excelled under Gerrard at Rangers. Budget Around £30m. Ben Fisher
Brentford The Bees’ squad depth has been tested to the limit by injuries and, even though relegation looks unlikely, they have been exposed at times. Thomas Frank would like to sign a right wing-back, although he appears to have missed out on the Monaco-bound Brazilian Vanderson. Goalkeeping cover for the injured David Raya and competition for the strike duo of Ivan Toney and Bryan Mbeumo could also come into consideration. Some squad players could depart on loan. Budget Around £20m should secure them the calibre of players they need. NA Brighton Another striker who could lighten the load on Neal Maupay’s shoulders has remained elusive but Graham Potter will know that if he can find one then it could make all the difference. Brighton welcomed back Danny Welbeck from his injury layoff as they ended their winless run against Brentford on Boxing Day and have been linked with a £20m move for Blackburn’s Ben Brereton Díaz in January. They may face some competition given the Chile international’s goalscoring record so this season but with several key players coming back from injury, Potter is likely to be able to concentrate his resources on his main targets. Budget Around £20m. Ed Aarons Burnley As with any side in relegation trouble, Burnley will be keen to add to their brittle squad. Sean Dyche has spoken to the owners about bringing in some new faces. Scoring has been an issue, so a striker and added creativity are the areas the club plan to target. Summer signing Maxwel Cornet – their biggest attacking threat – is off to the Africa Cup of Nations, making the matter far more urgent for the club, as they rely heavily on him. Budget They do not work to specific numbers but it is safe to say there is money to spend on requisite signings. Will Unwin Chelsea Much depends on whether Ben Chilwell makes a quick recovery from the knee injury he sustained against Juventus in November. Chilwell needs surgery and they could go into the market if the left wing-back is ruled out for the season. Everton’s Lucas Digne is an option. Meanwhile Thomas Tuchel could revive his interest in the Sevilla centre-back, Jules Koundé, and there could be a move for the Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. Budget Tuchel should have funds given that Chelsea missed out on Kounde last summer. Jacob Steinberg
Crystal Palace A busy summer window that saw Palace strengthen their squad in several departments means that it’s unlikely to be a busy window for Patrick Vieira and co. The Frenchman has insisted that despite the absence of Wilfried Zaha, Cheikhou Kouyaté and Wilfried Zaha for the Africa Cup of Nations he is only interested in signing players who can improve his side. They have been linked with Roma forward Borja Mayoral and Napoli midfielder André-Frank Zambo Anguissa, although both may be out of reach for now. Budget Funds in place if the right player becomes available. EA Everton There is a pressing need for Everton to act swiftly and successfully in this transfer window with the squad’s weaknesses exposed regularly and criticism of the club’s direction under Farhad Moshiri mounting. Rafael Benítez, who spent merely £1.7m in his first window as manager, wants to strengthen in both full-back positions – Dynamo Kiev left-back Vitaliy Mykolenko and Rangers’ right-back Nathan Patterson are targets – while a central midfielder, possibly Newcastle’s Sean Longstaff, is also on his wishlist. Budget “I think we will have some money to spend but I don’t think that will be too much,” said Benítez, whose budget could be shaped by whether Lucas Digne stays or leaves. Andy Hunter Leeds Marcelo Bielsa’s budget is said to be “tight”, but the Leeds manager has always preferred to work with a relatively small nucleus of senior professionals. Injuries to, among others, Patrick Bamford and Kalvin Phillips this season have suggested that he might have taken this policy too far and, with relegation now a real danger, some spending is expected. The Reading central midfielder John Swift is one target, but another striker is also required. Ditto an extra defender. Budget Might stretch to £20m. Louise Taylor
Leicester Brendan Rodgers hopes good news is on the horizon, with a raft of key players set to return to fitness in the coming weeks, lessening the need to strengthen defensively this window. Rodgers is hopeful of having Caglar Soyuncu and Jonny Evans back before the end of the month, while James Justin and Wesley Fofana are into the final stages of their rehab. A shopping spree is off the menu but no club in the division is likely to have more players at the Africa Cup of Nations, with at least four players set for duty. Budget Around £10m. BF Liverpool Stellar names continue to be linked with Anfield but, as previous windows have demonstrated, Jürgen Klopp is reluctant to buy in January unless a golden opportunity (Virgil van Dijk) or a bargain (Takumi Minamino) presents itself. Last year he broke with the habit of avoiding short-term measures to sign Ozan Kabak and Ben Davies on deadline day, only to discover better solutions to a defensive crisis under his nose in Nat Phillips and Rhys Williams. The Africa Cup of Nations will stretch resources up front although Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané will potentially miss only two Premier League games. Budget Liverpool made a profit on transfers in the summer, underlining how stringently the club is operating in Covid times and while building a new stand on Anfield Road. AH Manchester City Ferran Torres has joined Barcelona but this may be Manchester City’s only major piece of business as Pep Guardiola’s wish to sign a No 9 appears one to be revisited in the summer window. A glance at the Premier League table shows why: the champions lead as they continue to be a formidable force. Guardiola’s is a close-to-perfect squad. Budget £100m-plus but likely to be kept until the summer. Jamie Jackson Manchester United A central midfielder of Declan Rice’s quality remains the No 1 target but Ralf Rangnick’s hopes of landing the West Ham player or AN Other in this window appears remote. A centre-back who can challenge Raphaël Varane, Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof is the next priority but, again, this may have to wait until the close season. The interim manager has green-lit Anthony Martial’s desire to leave so the forward may do so in January – possibly on loan. Budget £50-100m. JJ
Newcastle Talk about a paradox. Newcastle may be the world’s richest club but they are also in acute relegation peril and, accordingly, not the most attractive destination for top talent. While reinforcing the defence – where Atlético Madrid’s Kieran Trippier and Lille’s Sven Botman rank among the assorted targets – remains Eddie Howe’s priority, central midfield also requires bolstering. Fresh injuries to his two best players, Allan Saint-Maximin and Callum Wilson, have made frontline recruitment another unexpected imperative. Budget Financial fair play rules would allow Newcastle to spend up to £200m. LT Norwich There is hardly a position on the pitch where Norwich could not do with reinforcement. Only at centre half, where City have five first-team options, are there the requisite numbers, but with 31 goals conceded it’s hard to argue there isn’t room for improvement there too. The need is greatest in attack where Norwich have scored only eight times in 18 games, but the club’s sporting director, Stuart Webber, has made clear that manager Dean Smith will not have money to spend unless players leave. Max Aarons, the subject of interest from Tottenham and Everton, is the most saleable asset. Budget £5m maximum. Paul MacInnes Southampton Ralph Hasenhüttl is relaxed after adding greater depth to his squad in the summer, but the Saints could look to utilise the one permitted loan spot they have left. They could also try to replicate the success they have had with teenage sensation Tino Livramento, a £5m pickup from Chelsea, by luring a youngster from a rival with the carrot of first-team opportunities. They have a decision to make over whether to extend 40-year-old goalkeeper Willy Caballero’s deal beyond January. “I’m not a big friend of transfers in the January window,” Hasenhüttl says. Budget Around £5m. BF Tottenham Antonio Conte wants a centre-half and someone for the right flank but he knows that, even though Daniel Levy says he will always back him for the right player, sales will be vital to the extent of that backing. Virtually everybody in the squad has his price and the key question will be whether they are realistic – with particular focus on those for Joe Rodon, Steven Bergwijn, Harry Winks and Dele Alli. Budget Levy could stump up £20m-£25m. On the other hand, he could not and it will be largely sell-to-buy. David Hytner Watford The only top-flight team yet to keep a clean sheet, Watford will at the very minimum seek to strengthen the centre of their defence this month, while with the summer gamble on Danny Rose having apparently failed a left-back would also be useful. The Hornets rarely spend heavily on defenders and January is not usually a time for bargains, so loan moves – Sead Kolasinac has been linked – might be preferred. Budget Limited while relegation remains a threat – perhaps £10m. Simon Burnton
West Ham West Ham desperately need a new centre-back after losing Angelo Ogbonna and Kurt Zouma to serious injuries. Liverpool’s Nat Phillips, Bournemouth’s Lloyd Kelly and Burnley’s James Tarkowski have been targeted by David Moyes, who needs strong backing from the board. West Ham’s squad looks stretched and they would also like reinforcements in attack. Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard is still on their wishlist and Moyes likes the Blackburn striker, Ben Brereton Díaz. Links with Sparta Prague’s Adam Hlozek also refuse to go away. Budget Could be as much as £30m following Daniel Kretinsky’s arrival on the board. JS Wolves A low-key window is likely, with no major incomings expected. Wolves could recall Rúben Vinagre and Dion Sanderson from loans to cover for the Morocco defender Romain Saïss heading to the Africa Cup of Nations and give Bruno Lage a chance to cast his eye over his options. Going forward, Wolves are set to be boosted by the returns of Jonny, Pedro Neto and Hwang Hee-chan from injury before the end of January. Rúben Neves and Adama Traoré have admirers but it is difficult to envisage Wolves sanctioning sales unless clubs offer silly money. Budget Up to £10m.

6148;6148;How can Britain become a ‘great cycling nation’ when it’s so scary to ride a bike? | Adam Becket;2022-01-01T08:00:44Z;['Adam Becket'];['Cycling', 'Road safety', 'Transport policy', 'Transport', 'Politics', 'Life and style', 'UK news'];"There is a pothole on the Bristol Road just north of Nailsea, north Somerset, which I cycled over at about 30mph back in June. It casually blew out both my tyres; somehow I managed to skid, on my two flats, to a stop. It is in moments like this that your vulnerability as a cyclist comes into focus, and you realise how little there is between you and death: a bit of plastic on your head, a thin bit of Lycra, your wits and skill on the bike. Britain’s roads are in a terrible state thanks to austerity. According to the RAC, 6% of B and C roads are in need of repairs, a proportion that has remained the same for the past five years. It is bad for cars, but even worse for cyclists riding in the gutter. One thing you quickly learn when out riding, as I have been for more than 300 hours this year, is you have to pay attention. Vehicles can appear at any point and will do anything. I have been pushed into hedges by two-tonne SUVs, almost T-boned by hatchbacks, forced to dice with death in narrow bike lanes. It is simply accepted that this is what cycling is: taking your life in your hands every time you get in the saddle. I have not always been a Cyclist with a capital C. I used my bike to get to school, to commute to work in London, to just get around. That all changed thanks to the pandemic. I suddenly had nothing to do and seemingly endless time to explore new places by bike.
I found that cycling was not only something to occupy my time, or even just to keep me fit; it benefited my mental health enormously. Last year I cycled 4,039 miles around Southampton and then Bristol; this year I reached 5,000 miles, mostly in the south-west. I have been to Wales, to Cheddar Gorge and the New Forest on my steed. It truly is the best way to explore, to understand the geography of a place. Pacing along country lanes, almost at one with nature, never gets old. The freedom that comes with my bike also opens up my mind. It is not too much of a stretch to say I might not have survived the pandemic without it. As thrilling as it can be, road cycling in the UK is still incredibly perilous, and there is evidence the pandemic has made matters worse. New data from the Department for Transport showed that 89 cyclists lost their lives on rural roads in 2020, compared with 60 the previous year. Britain is dominated by the private car – but it doesn’t have to be this way. Last year during the height of the first lockdown, Boris Johnson said that he would usher in a “golden age” for cycling: £2bn was promised, with £250m of that forming part of an emergency “active travel” fund to be used by councils to build “protected space for cycling”. Cycling was so much nicer during those halcyon days of spring and summer 2020, when cycle lanes were temporarily installed on largely empty roads, and active travel seemed to be a genuine priority. Comparatively, though, £27bn was put towards roadbuilding in the 2020 budget, which includes 50 projects, from a tunnel on the A303 near Stonehenge to a Lower Thames Crossing linking Kent and Essex. While this investment was reviewed thanks to the pandemic, it is clear where the Conservative government’s priorities lie. The truth is that cycling infrastructure is still seen as something to be tacked on. It is a token gesture towards a greener and healthier country; often as weak as a painted white bicycle on the asphalt. These drawings offer surprisingly little protection against the SUV roaring past you at 60mph. I have lost track of the amount of times a driver has had a go at me for holding them up, or not pulling over – for simply existing. It is all too usual for someone to pass me so close that I wobble, and all I can do is shout expletives into the wind. Cyclists are forced to share the road space with everyone else, and are then abused, intimidated and even spat at – as I have been three times this year – just for having the temerity to be precariously occupying a tiny amount of that shared space. How can we become a “great cycling nation”, as Grant Shapps put it in May 2020, when it is so scary to ride a bike? It is fine for me to pontificate about all the benefits of cycling, but without the provisions to ride safely, many will never try it. Cycling isn’t the preferred activity for millions in the Netherlands because it is a flat country: it is because there has been consistent investment in infrastructure there. According to the 2018 book Building the Cycling City, the Dutch government spends £22 per person, a year, on cycling – 15 times the amount spent in England. The Netherlands has 35,000km (21,750 miles) of fully separated cycle lanes – infrastructure that separates the motor vehicle from the bike, and both from pedestrians at the same time. We need more people on bikes. For the sake of the environment, obviously, but also for the sake of public health. My addiction to pedalling is not going to abate anytime soon – I am hooked now – but cycling needs to be taken seriously if we are to achieve a better world. The bicycle is an emancipatory machine, and it should be safe for everyone to use one on our roads.

6149;6149;Streaming: Mubi’s First Films season and other essential director debuts;2022-01-01T08:00:44Z;['Guy Lodge'];['Film', 'Drama films', 'Mubi', 'Culture', 'Orson Welles', 'Ken Loach', 'Jean-Luc Godard', 'Maggie Gyllenhaal', 'John Cassavetes', 'John Huston', 'Andrea Arnold'];"The start of a new year always makes one feel inclined to do something new, whether it’s taking up knitting, committing to a workout regime or, for the more ambitious among us, making a film. In a suitable spirit of beginnings, Mubi annually serves this impulse with its First Films First series of essential debut features by major film-makers – though most of them, admittedly, don’t inspire a surge of hopeful “I could do that” confidence. Mubi’s debut selections this year are a formidable bunch, beginning with their admittedly pretty downbeat New Year’s Day pick, Andrea Arnold’s sharp, lean, unshakable revenge drama Red Road (2006), which set the tone for one of the great sensory film-making careers in British cinema. That’s followed up with Roy Andersson’s A Swedish Love Story, a gentle, tender coming-of-age romance from 1970, drawing inspiration from the likes of Miloš Forman, that you’d scarcely recognise as the work of the man latterly known for his arch absurdist formalism. Other highlights from the Mubi lineup include Chadian director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun’s lively, Godard-referencing docudrama Bye Bye Africa (1999), built around a fictionalised version of the director himself; Lucile Hadžihalilović’s La bouche de Jean-Pierre (1996), with its vivid, unnerving evocation of teenage trauma and abuse; and British film-maker Daniel Kokotajlo’s vastly moving Apostasy (2017), about a family riven by Jehovah’s Witness law. It’s a very fine group of films, though it does rather create the impression that directors can only start their careers by plunging into the heart of despair.
To carry the theme beyond Mubi’s mini festival, then, there are more comforting debut features to be found among Hollywood classics – none perkier than the ever-cheering sailors-on-leave musical On the Town (1949; Amazon), which gave both Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly their first directorial credit. The 1940s also gave us the most celebrated and prodigious debut film of all time: even if you don’t subscribe to the enduring awe surrounding Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane (1941; BBC iPlayer), you’d be hard-pressed to find many first features executed on such a robustly ambitious scale. From the same year, you hear less talk about John Huston’s immortal noir The Maltese Falcon being among the great debuts – only because it’s so supremely hardboiled, you assume he’d been directing for aeons.
Mid-century New Wave auteurs had an eerie habit of debuting with films fully formed in aesthetic and outlook: take the French pair of Agnès Varda’s fierce, precise La Pointe Courte (1955; Curzon) and Jean-Luc Godard’s still radical, still jazz-cool Breathless (1960; BFI Player), for example. Over in Italy, Luchino Visconti arrived in the sparest, most ruthless form of his career with Ossessione (1943; Amazon); the recently departed Lina Wertmüller began with clear-eyed sociopolitical observation in her lovely 1963 debut The Basilisks (Amazon). John Cassavetes didn’t just arrive, but announced a whole new form of independent cinema with his wrenching Shadows (1959; Amazon), just as Ken Loach did for British realism a decade later in the potent, anti-swinging 60s snapshot Poor Cow (1967; BFI Player), while Steven Soderbergh rewrote the Cassavetes indie playbook three decades later in his pithy, witty sex, lies, and videotape (1989; Apple TV). In my lifetime, few debuts have announced a major directorial career as tellingly and evocatively as Claire Denis’s sensuous, post-colonial reflection Chocolat (1988; BFI Player), Quentin Tarantino’s bloody, chatty, nasty shoot-’em-down Reservoir Dogs (1992; Amazon) or Jordan Peele’s ghoulishly funny race-hate horror Get Out (2017; Google Play). I can only hope that some of my favourite recent debuts, including Maggie Gyllenhaal’s knotty psychodrama The Lost Daughter (2021; now on Netflix) and Serbian director Milica Tomović’s raucous, politically inflected farce Celts (2021; Google Play), lead to similarly sustained greatness. Also new on DVD and streaming Malignant (Warner Bros) James Wan’s utterly unhinged, reality-blurring horror film died a swift death in cinemas last year, but a cult following has been quick to form, cheered on by kitsch-loving critics – not surprising for a genuinely eccentric, spirited film that rejects studio genre formula.
Venom: Let There Be Carnage (Sony) Speaking of eccentric studio genre fare, 2018’s Venom was both deliriously stupid and a refreshingly loose-limbed deviation from stiffly moralistic superhero tradition. Andy Serkis’s sequel is, if anything, even more so, with the actor-film-maker unsurprisingly giving free rein to Tom Hardy’s loopy, physically immersed performance of a hybrid human-alien vigilante. Sure, why not? In the Realm of the Senses (Sony) The Criterion Collection welcomes Japanese film-maker Nagisa Oshima’s once controversial, still nervy 1976 erotic drama to its ranks. This glittering, high-definition transfer has the usual array of extras, though the film’s frank, upsetting study of obsessive, escalating power plays between a hotel maid and her abusive boss speaks for itself, passing barely perceptibly from transcendent beauty to stomach-churning violence.";https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/01/streaming-mubi-first-films-season-and-other-essential-director-debuts

7 January Film The 400 Blows In cinemas François Truffaut’s 1959 debut is a luminous early masterpiece of the French New Wave. Back out today in a 4K restoration, it follows sensitive truant, tearaway and Truffaut surrogate Antoine Doinel. He is played, in one of cinema’s great child performances, by the 14-year-old Jean-Pierre Léaud, who would later reprise the role for Truffaut on four further occasions over the next two decades. RG 8 January Art The Sunken Garden Margate A literally overlooked gem, this award-winning garden is dug almost below sight-lines into Thanet’s headland, a breezy winter walk from Margate’s famed sands. First landscaped in the 1930s, it was recently brought back to life by the local community with permanent contemporary artworks added to its hardy planting scheme last autumn. These intentionally low-key additions exploring its history and ecology include sound works and a sculptural composting bin. It’s a good option for a bracing weekend walk.

6151;6151;‘We lost everything’: Colorado wildfire destroys hundreds of homes;2022-01-01T08:00:43Z;['N/A'];['Colorado', 'Wildfires', 'US news'];"Just as the flakes of the season’s first winter storm began to fall in the Colorado foothills, Heather Diiorio, 67, and her husband walked hand in hand in a daze down South 68th Street in Louisville, a community often ranked as one of America’s most livable small towns. They had just gone to inspect their home after one of Colorado’s most destructive fires in history struck this week. “All I can say is we lived there 35 years and we lost everything,” said Diioro’s husband before emotion overwhelmed him. He declined to give his first name. He and his wife embraced neighbors, some of whom had also lost their homes in Thursday’s fires, and others who had not. “By the grace of God, we still have a beautiful house standing here,” said Steve Kingswood, 68, whose home was surrounded by the charred remains of other houses. “My wife and I will do the best we can to love our neighbors and respond to their needs.”
The fire burned in a mosaic fashion as the flames and 160km/h (99mph) winds combined to act like a blowtorch to some structures, while completely missing others, mainly in the towns of Louisville and Superior. The fire destroyed at least 500 structures, mostly homes, and moved so quickly that many fled on foot or as flames licked at their cars. More than 30,000 people fled or were evacuated to stay in local recreation centers. “We still have no reports of casualties or fatalities,” the Boulder county sheriff, Joe Pelle, said in a news conference Friday. “That’s awesome news and given the events we had yesterday that’s pretty miraculous.” Pelle and the Colorado governor, Jared Polis, surveyed the fire damage from the air on Friday morning. Polis said Joe Biden called him and expedited a major disaster declaration to speed up assistance to those who suffered losses in the fire. Bin Zhang, 59, and his wife emigrated from China and worked and saved to be able to live in the Louisville home they bought two years ago that is now burned to the foundation. “We enjoyed the neighborhood and open space,” he said. “It was a peaceful place to live near a vibrant city like Boulder. The force of nature is beyond everyone’s description.” The people of Boulder county, including Louisville, have had to brace against nature’s force several times in the past decade alone. They have experienced at least four major wildfires and a historic flood, whose destruction was exacerbated by erosion caused by previous fires. This year, the region has experienced unseasonably warm temperatures and a drought. The first snowstorm of the season, abnormally late, arrived on Friday as homes still smoldered.
In the summer of 2020, Colorado suffered three of the largest wildfires in its history, but those fires burned over the course of days or even weeks. Thursday’s blaze devastated suburban neighborhoods and shopping plazas with familiar stores like Target and Costco in half a day, accelerated by winds so fierce they overturned at least three semi-trailers on local highways and knocked down power lines, which are suspected of having sparked the fire. Wildfires in the American west have been burning later into the fall and into the winter, with scientists pointing to the climate crisis as the likely culprit due to rising temperatures and disrupted moisture patterns. “This hit close to home for so many of us, but also in terms of this being a fire that wasn’t a wildfire in the forest. It was a suburban and urban fire,” Polis said. “We talk about houses destroyed. Each house is not just a house. It’s a home. It’s a sanctuary of comfort and a reservoir of memories.”
Throughout Louisville and Superior on Friday, yellow and black smoke rose through the air with at least one fire reigniting in Louisville. Fire patrols fanned out through the area and warned those checking on their homes to turn around because of lingering danger, including small fires, toxic smoke and unstable power lines held up by burned wooden poles. Planes flew overhead surveying the damage while police cars blocked roads. Those who wanted to reach their homes had to do so on foot in many places, including South 68th Street. “I know residents want to get back to their homes as soon as possible to assess damage,” Sheriff Pelle said. “In many of those neighborhoods that are currently blocked off it’s still too dangerous to return. We saw still active fires in many places this morning and saw downed power lines and a lot of risks that we’re still trying mitigate.” Once Zhang finished surveying his destroyed home and taking photos for his neighbors of the condition of their houses, he returned to the main road where police had blocked vehicles from entering. He encountered his wife and daughter, both in tears. His wife was too overcome to talk, but his daughter was measured, almost a bit world weary. “It’s hard to let go but things come back,” said Laura Zhang, 20. “So many people go through this kind of thing.”";https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/01/colorado-wildfires-destroy-hundreds-homes

Luck plays a big part in politics and the shadow chancellor took full advantage of her good fortune when Keir Starmer tested positive for Covid just before the October 2021 budget. According to parliamentary tradition, the leader of the opposition responds to the chancellor’s budget speech, but Starmer’s absence meant Reeves stepped in and, by general consent, delivered a polished reply to Rishi Sunak. No single speech, no matter how widely praised, will be enough to revive Labour’s fortunes after four successive election defeats, and 2022 will be a crucial year for the party and for Reeves. Although the government has been floundering, the message from byelections, opinion polls and focus groups is that the public still have their doubts about Labour. The former Bank of England economist’s task as shadow chancellor is to come up with an approach to running the economy that is radical enough to be eye-catching yet also reassuring. She will need to do more than attack the Tories for higher taxes and rising inflation: she will need to start fleshing out Labour’s alternative. Larry Elliott Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala
The task facing the World Trade Organization’s director general over the next 12 months is simple: to save it from irrelevance or – even worse – from falling apart completely, When Okonjo-Iweala was appointed last year, much was made of her being the first woman and first African in the role, but it was her reputation as a political operator that decided the contest in her favour. She will need skills honed as finance minister in her native Nigeria and during 25 years spent at the World Bank to navigate her way through three big issues facing the WTO. The immediate task is to find agreement to waive patent rights on Covid vaccines so that developing countries can produce their own treatments for the pandemic. Success there would enhance Okonjo-Iweala’s reputation as a political fixer and give her a better chance of resolving two longer-running issues. When it was created in 1995, the WTO had two core functions: to deliver multilateral trade deals and to settle trade disputes between member states. For the past few years it has struggled to do either under a succession of technocratic leaders. The next year will show whether Okonjo-Iweala can do better. LE Kristalina Georgieva
When she was selected to succeed Christine Lagarde as the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Georgieva was seen as a safe pair of hands, but it hasn’t quite turned out that way. She has become the latest occupant of her office to be afflicted by the curse of Washington’s 19th Street, the home of the IMF. Like Lagarde and her predecessor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Georgieva has been touched by scandal and only just clung on to her job last year. The row over whether she tampered with a report to give a more favourable impression of China during her previous job at the World Bank was a distraction the IMF could have done without as it sought to deal with the economic fallout from the pandemic. A slowing global recovery, upward pressure on inflation caused by supply bottlenecks, the threat of financial crisis in two of the bigger middle-income countries – Turkey and Argentina – and the buildup of worrying levels of debt in many low-income states are all pressing issues. Georgieva will have her hands full in 2022 and must show she has put her personal troubles behind her. LE Emma Walmsley
The chief executive of GSK was masterminding a bold revamp of Britain’s second-biggest drugmaker when the New York activist hedge fund Elliott Management emerged on the shareholder register in April. Since then, Elliott has kept Walmsley – a former L’Oréal executive who took the helm at GSK in spring 2017 – on her toes. GSK has firmly resisted the hedge fund’s public demands that she reapply for her job before the demerger of its consumer healthcare division planned for the middle of next year. Walmsley has stuck to her plans, and has received a boost lately from a spate of good news. GSK’s long-acting HIV treatment Vocabria, which replaces daily tablets with an injection every two months, was last month recommended by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which decides which drugs are available on the NHS. The company has also agreed a $1bn (£740m) contract with the US government to provide its Covid-19 treatment Sotrovimab, which has been shown to reduce hospitalisation and deaths by 79%. Yet Walmsley probably needs more successes in the drugs pipeline to keep Elliott at bay and to prove to other investors that GSK’s turnaround is under way. It will be a tense six months until the split of the business is complete. Julia Kollewe Sharon White
The chair of the John Lewis Partnership has been in her post for less than two years but has already caused quite a stir. The former Ofcom boss has already closed 16 loss-making John Lewis branches, including major Birmingham and Sheffield outlets, cut thousands of jobs and shelved the annual staff bonus for 2020. The staff-owned enterprise’s “partners” are now waiting to see if that bonus can be restored through stronger online sales and new avenues of business including financial services, building homes for rent above some stores and widening distribution with outlets on local high streets. White is betting that retail alone will not deliver the kind of profit margins capable of keeping staff well remunerated, but there is a fear that her team’s new ideas are riskier bets than shops and could be a distraction. Meanwhile, back at the retail coalface there are plenty of challenges ahead. John Lewis, under attack from cheaper rivals, is expected to ditch the brand’s “never knowingly undersold” policy – a key part of its pitch to shoppers for almost a century. It’s not clear how shoppers will react. The first step towards that aim was the introduction of the cheaper Anyday range, which some see as a misstep downmarket and others as vital in recalibrating its image for younger shoppers. Waitrose is also facing tricky times. Having cut ties with the online specialist Ocado, giving new life to Marks & Spencer, the supermarket faces a battalion of cheaper rivals during a period of high inflation. Finding cash to expand its newly independent online business could be a challenge. Sarah Butler Alex Mahon
The chief executive of Channel 4 faces the biggest challenge of her tenure this year when the government’s push to privatise the broadcaster comes to a head. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, will publish her final decision on whether to sell off Channel 4 in the new year, dampening its 40th anniversary of being set up as a publicly owned, commercially funded alternative to the BBC and ITV. Mahon has her work cut out to fend off what looks to be a political fait accompli, despite widespread criticism that any new owner would have to make large cuts to its programming budget and scrap much of its commercially unattractive content to boost profits. But Mahon may yet win the day, with Channel 4 having survived about half a dozen attempts to push the privatisation agenda over the years. The most serious came under David Cameron’s government in 2016. Against what seemed insurmountable odds the broadcaster survived, with the government able to save face in a “levelling up” deal that has resulted in significant operations and more than a third of staff moving out of London, as well as the opening of a new national headquarters in Leeds and creative hubs in Bristol and Glasgow. Mahon appears to have no such sweeping strategy changes to offer that might appease ministers this time around. However, with mounting opposition from TV producers in the nations and regions arguing that privatisation is diametrically opposed to the government’s agenda of spreading wealth across the country, the battle is not over yet. Mark Sweney Debbie Crosbie
Crosbie has become a dominant figure in the mid-tier banking sector, becoming the first woman to lead for two major UK institutions: TSB and, in 2022, the UK’s largest mutual lender, Nationwide. She joined TSB in 2019 from the Clydesdale Bank owner CYBG – since rebranded as Virgin Money – where she had worked for more than 20 years, becoming its chief operating officer in 2015. Crosbie since led a turnaround at TSB, after an IT meltdown in 2018 that left 1.9 million customers locked out of their accounts tarnished the bank’s reputation and led to the ousting of her predecessor, Paul Pester. During her tenure, Crosbie has cut nearly 1,000 jobs and shut nearly half of branches as part of a gruelling restructuring programme. But after three years at the helm, Crosbie leaves TSB in good stead, having led the bank back to a profit in the half year to June. She is due to replace Joe Garner as chief executive of the Nationwide building society in the first half of 2022. She joins a small cadre of female bosses in the City, which is still grappling with a male-dominated sector where men make up about 70% of senior management positions, according to the Women in Finance Charter’s latest annual review. Kalyeena Makortoff Leena Nair
The appointment of the Indian-born executive as CEO of the luxury brand Chanel in December was greeted as a sign of much-needed diversity coming to fashion. The hope is that Nair’s appointment will provide an example for other brands in the industry. Nair moves to Chanel from Unilever where she was used to firsts – she was the company’s first Asian, first female and youngest ever chief HR officer.
She will have challenges at Chanel, a private company that has been owned by the same family since the 1920s. Nair will take over from Alain Wertheimer, the grandson of Pierre who originally invested in Chanel. Wertheimer will remain involved as global chair. Nair will face problems familiar across fashion: the pandemic led to sales at Chanel falling by 18% in 2020. While the company rallied, with revenue growing in the first half of this year, she will want to keep that trajectory up in 2022. Some of her focus will undoubtedly be on Chanel’s workforce. Speaking to Time in 2021, she said: “Human capital is as important as financial capital.” At Unilever, Nair oversaw about 150,000 people in 190 countriesand worked on its diversity and inclusion programme. Last year it was announced that Unilever was gender balanced at management level globally.

6153;6153;UK’s first black bookshop weighs move to new site after £50k raised to save it;2022-01-01T08:00:43Z;['Tom Ambrose'];['Books', 'Retail industry', 'Race', 'Culture', 'London', 'UK news'];"The UK’s first specialist black bookshop is weighing up a move to new premises after a crowdfunding campaign to save it from closure raised £50,000 in just a few days. New Beacon Books was founded in 1966 and has been based in Stroud Green Road, north London, for all but one year of its existence. It announced in December that it would be forced to close its physical store in Finsbury Park due to competition from online retailers and the effects of the Covid pandemic, prompting dismay at the potential loss of a “crucial cultural space”. Campaigners launched a crowdfunder in a bid to raise the cash to keep the shop open. Its £35,000 target was smashed within 48 hours. By Friday, more than £50,000 had been raised in support of the shop. New Beacon Books’ director, Michael La Rose, said this week that the shop may have to find new premises so that it can scale up its publishing arm to avoid going online only.
“In order to meet its financial commitments, New Beacon Books must continue to do much more than just sell books,” he said in a statement. “The publishing arm … has been scaled down considerably, but there are increasing calls for New Beacon Publications to commission and publish work by young creatives and provide a forum for the exchange of ideas. “For New Beacon Books to do this, it must be able to make full use of its existing space and, if necessary, relocate to premises that will allow for the expansion of its publishing and public affairs programmes as well as for bookselling.” He added that an alternative premises may be needed “to accommodate publishing, bookselling, writers in residence [and] public programmes.” Francesca Gilbert, a campaigner who helped to organise the campaign, said: “The New Beacon bookshop exists as far more than just a bookshop. It is an invaluable institution of black history that is needed now more than ever. “It is a crucial cultural space rich with the affirmation, validation and celebration of black literature, culture and art that must be preserved.” She added: “As a young mixed-race Caribbean woman of colour, I never feel more affirmed and held than I do when I spend an afternoon at the New Beacon bookshop surrounded by the work of writers who uplift black voices and stories. It is a second home, a heartbeat and a legacy that we must protect now and in the years to come.”";https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/01/uks-first-black-bookshop-weighs-move-to-new-site-after-50k-raised-to-save-it
6154;6154;New year’s Yves: museums mark 60th anniversary of Saint Laurent debut;2022-01-01T08:00:43Z;['Kim Willsher'];['Yves Saint Laurent', 'Fashion', 'Art', 'Paris', 'Art and design', 'Europe', 'World news', 'France', 'Culture', 'Museums'];"Simultaneous exhibitions to mark the 60th anniversary of Yves Saint Laurent’s first collection are to be held by six leading Paris museums in an unprecedented tribute from the art world to the late French fashion designer. The events at museums, among them the Louvre and the Musée d’Orsay, will reveal how the celebrated couturier was inspired by some of the 20th century’s greatest artists including Picasso, Matisse and Mondrian. Mouna Mekouar, who curated the multi-centre event that will feature the designer’s work placed in the context of each establishment’s permanent collections, said the participation of some of France’s largest and most renowned museums was unprecedented. “I thought it would be impossible to get so many museums to agree to our idea, but they were all very interested and hugely enthusiastic from the beginning. It is the first time they have all worked together on one project,” Mekouar said. “Saint Laurent was very much inspired by art and this shows the links and dialogue between his work and the museum exhibits. We didn’t want to put the clothes in a room, we wanted them there among the permanent collections.
“In this way visitors will rediscover those collections at the same time as paying homage to Yves Saint Laurent. It’s like a cultural archipelago.” Saint Laurent, who died in 2008 aged 71, was just 26 when he founded his haute couture house with the businessman Pierre Bergé in December 1961. He had moved to Paris nine years previously where his designs quickly gained notice and he was introduced to Christian Dior, then a giant in the fashion world.
Yves Saint Laurent presented his first haute couture show on 29 January 1962. “I believe the work of a couturier is very much like that of an artist. In fact, I have constantly found inspiration in the work of contemporary painters: Picasso, Matisse, Mondrian,” Saint Laurent said later. “Always influenced by painting, I owe my July 1966 collection to American painters like Wesselman, Roy Lichtenstein. All my dresses were lit with landscapes, moons and sunlight,” he added.
“How could I resist pop art that was the expression of my youth.” The six museums taking part in Yves Saint Laurent Aux Musées, which runs from 29 January to 15 May, are the Centre Pompidou, the Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris, the Musée du Louvre, Musée d’Orsay, Musée Picasso and the Musée Yves Saint Laurent. Each will feature different aspects of Saint Laurent’s work. At the Louvre there will be some of his most exceptional garments, including jackets embroidered with gold and crystals. At the Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris, Saint Laurent designs will echo the colours of the artists Pierre Bonnard and Raoul Dufy. The Musée d’Orsay will feature some of the evening wear he created for the Proust Ball to mark the 100th birthday of the writer whose guests dressed by Saint Laurent included Baron Guy de Rothschild and Jane Birkin.
A total of 50 Saint Laurent creations will be on display as part of the exhibition as well as about 300 designs. At the Yves Saint Laurent museum, visitors will be taken through the creative process from sketch to finished garment. Mekouar spoke of the “dialogue” Saint Laurent created between “art and literature” and said the designer expressed “a whole artistic universe” through his creations. “It wasn’t just one collection but his whole life’s work that was linked to art. It’s about looking at Saint Laurent from the perspective of art. Both Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé were great collectors of art and this had a great influence on the fashion designs,” Mekouar said.
“I think he would never had said he was an artist, but today with the links between art and fashion I think we can see Saint Laurent as a creative artist.” Madison Cox, an American garden designer who married Bergé shortly before the latter’s death in 2017 who is president of the Pierre Bergé – Yves Saint Laurent Foundation said the exhibition was an extraordinary showcase “of one of the greatest innovators of French fashion”. “For Yves Saint Laurent, the fine arts were an inexhaustible source of inspiration, embracing all cultures throughout history. This constant dialogue was a key element of the designer’s boundless ingenuity and creativity,” Cox wrote.";https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/01/the-art-of-yves-saint-laurent-design-house-marks-60th-anniversary
6155;6155;Kashmir stampede at Hindu shrine kills at least 12 people;2022-01-01T07:37:07Z;['N/A'];['Kashmir', 'India', 'South and central Asia'];"At least 12 people have died and 13 were injured in a stampede at a religious shrine in Indian-administered Kashmir as thousands of pilgrims massed to offer prayers. The disaster happened around 3am on New Year’s Day while it was still dark on the route to the Vaishno Devi shrine, one of the area’s most revered Hindu sites. “People fell over each other ... It was difficult to figure out whose leg or arms were tangled with whose,” witness Ravinder, who gave only one name, told AFP. “I helped pick up eight bodies by the time ambulances arrived after about half an hour. I feel lucky to be alive but am still shaking with memory of what I saw.”
One official said that there was a rush to offer special prayers for the new year but this was not confirmed by others. Mahesh, a devotee who gave only one name, told Associated Press the stampede occurred near one of the gates where pilgrims entered and exited the route to the shrine. “Something happened near one of the gates and I found myself under a crush of people. I suffocated and fell but somehow managed to stand up,” he said. “I saw people moving over the bodies. It was a horrifying sight, but I managed to help in rescuing some injured people.” Another devotee named Priyansh said he and 10 friends from New Delhi arrived on Friday night to visit the shrine and that two of his friends died in the incident. “I have never seen anything like this,” he said.
The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, expressed his condolences on Twitter. “Extremely saddened by the loss of lives due to a stampede,” Modi wrote. Before the pandemic, every day about 100,000 devotees would trek up a steep winding track to the narrow cave containing the shrine to Vaishno Devi, about 60km from the city of Jammu. Authorities had capped the daily number to 25,000 but witnesses and press reports said that this may have been exceeded several times over. Two stampedes in as many months in 2008 – one in Rajasthan and one in Himachal Pradesh – left more than 370 people dead. Others in Kerala in 2011 and in Madhya Pradesh two years later each killed more than 100. In the latest incident, other reports suggested an argument had broken out between devotees. Rescue operations started immediately and the injured – some of whom were reported to be in a serious condition – were taken to hospital. Video footage on social media showed small minivan ambulances with flashing lights rushing to hospitals while it was still dark, as well as massive crowds.
Access to the shrine was halted after the stampede but later resumed. Witness Ravinder said the crush happened at a point where huge crowds of people coming down from the shrine meet those going up. He estimated that there were at least 100,000 people. “No one was checking registration slips of the devotees. I have been there many times but never seen such a rush of people,” he said. “It was only when some of us managed to lift a dead body up with our hands that people could see [what was happening] and made space for moving the bodies out,” he said.

6156;6156;Wayward by Dana Spiotta review – midlife madness in a mad America;2022-01-01T07:30:42Z;['Lucy Ellmann'];['Fiction', 'Books', 'Culture'];"It’s 2017 and Sam, a middle-class, perimenopausal wife and mother living in Syracuse, NY, is maddened by America. Who wouldn’t be? The US is both terrifying and electrifying in its inventiveness. In this, her fifth novel, Dana Spiotta is prepared to itemise her crazy country’s collapse. If her data collection effort ultimately becomes an exercise in passivity, there are a few good “Whoa!” moments along the way. This is the first year of Donald Trump’s destabilising presidency. Innocence has been defiled. Unarmed Black teenagers are getting shot in the back by cops, don’t-mess-with-me gun ownership is the prevailing ideal, and everybody’s a tattletale. At the state fair, which previously seemed innocuous to Sam, even charming, she now encounters T-shirts for sale that say things like “LGBT (Liberty, Guns, Beer, Trump)”. Other slogans attack the liberally minded, now derided as “snowflakes”. History is being obliterated, along with art, thought, justice, morality and landmark buildings. Sam seems almost alone in treasuring Arts and Crafts architecture and furniture, peeling paintwork and antique tiling, her daughter’s prepubescent years (now over), her mother’s perpetual love, the mid 19th-century Oneida community (exultantly adventurous about sex, but blemished by the practice of eugenics), and L Frank Baum, who gets off very lightly here despite his genocidal attitude to Native Americans. Dissatisfied with her fellow menopausal Trump-resisters – all sauvignon blanc, “landmine squats” and Hillary Clinton pantsuits – Sam leaves the comforts of suburbia for a solitary life in a crumbling house in downtown Syracuse that, like Sam herself, is “dirty, falling apart, empty too long”. There, she relishes the freedom to stay up all night, polish wooden floorboards and hardly ever eat. She even attends ghastly open-mic events at a local comedy club. She seems to be abandoning her self in order to study her society. Or she might just be unravelling. In place of old structures, sincerity and taste, online she discovers bizarre new allegiances that have emerged like fungi overnight, groups for this, groups for that. (For “group”, you could substitute “hatred”.) She meets a few of these networkers in person, but most of her investigations seem restricted to the stinky, stagnant pond of the internet, making the novel smell somewhat of the lamp. Still, many of Sam’s findings are plausibly excruciating.
Some of the off-gridders Spiotta catalogues advocate survivalism, others are opposed to cosmetic surgery (yet make exceptions for stomach flab). There are witchcraft communities with sidelines in sundials, and lots of Christians and dieters (anti-vaxxers haven’t yet hatched). A clandestine sorority of ageing women, calling itself Hardcore Hags, Harridans and Harpies, is matched by another outfit: Men Going Their Own Way. Some renegades dress badly; others have superb teeth. Sam has pretty much left her real life behind, including a husband – good in bed but offputtingly dependent on post-workout amino acid and whey protein shakes – and their teenage daughter Ally, a straight-A student who’s into etymology, dating older men and bearing grudges against her mother. Given Sam’s obsessive attitude towards Ally, which has at times driven her to spy on her daughter’s online activities and fixate on her breasts, this is probably just as well. To focus on a middle-aged woman is still an enterprising novelistic task. Alas, the book is besotted with the kid. Why can’t an ageing female character exist on her own in a piece of fiction without being mirrored by a youthful one? Held in this Trumpian vice of desirability, the younger contender (except maybe in the case of Bette Davis in All About Eve, or Mrs Merdle in Little Dorrit) is pretty much bound to come out on top. Ally duly develops an air of moral superiority, but she and her mother are so similar in outlook, you really wonder why Spiotta felt she needed them both. It would have been better to concentrate on Sam’s psyche, which wavers oddly between bewildered and smartass. Is she even likable? “Sam hated her own shallowness” … so do we.
While everybody in Syracuse runs more and more (as ordered by their personal trainers), Wayward plods along. It can get preachy and pedantic, too, and overly medical. Spiotta tussles valiantly with serious things – human nature, racial conflict, cancel culture, homelessness, road rage and feminism – without reaching firm conclusions. A fairly touching soliloquy on menstruation comes out of nowhere, then disappears as if ashamed of itself. Instead, the normally staid narrative approach, complete with loads of dutiful backgrounding and flurries of zeitgeist, makes this feel at times like an up-to-the-minute Anne Tyler novel. Spiotta’s analogy between the Trump presidency and the menopause is apt: both cause fatigue, anxiety, insomnia, sudden upsets, fury, revulsion, ostracism and a lot of sadness. But on second thoughts, this maligns the menopause, which can be a real liberation for women; Trump is only about terror. It’s clear men should not be running the world, but the wishy-washy women of Syracuse seem almost as untenable. • Lucy Ellmann’s Ducks, Newburyport is published by Galley Beggar.

6157;6157;New Year’s Eve: Times Square crowds return, NYC hails new mayor and Miley Cyrus battles wardrobe malfunction;2022-01-01T07:07:57Z;['Graham Russell'];['World news', 'New York', 'US news', 'Miley Cyrus', 'Bill de Blasio'];"A Miley Cyrus wardrobe malfunction, a celebrity rant about outgoing New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, and the traditional dropping of a six-tonne ball in Times Square were among the highlights as America welcomed the new year, and bid good riddance to the old one. The New Year’s Eve tradition of crowds at Times Square returned this year, though with only 15,000 of the usual 60,000 spectators there to watch the ball, encrusted with nearly 2,700 Waterford crystals, descend as couples embraced, some still wearing their masks.
Though the crowds were smaller, the throngs nevertheless stretched for blocks to soak in the celebration, with many traveling from afar to take part. Confetti lit up by electronic billboards swirled in a light wind on a mild winter night in New York. TV networks vied for supremacy to cover the night, with NBC’s offering from Miami fast becoming a talking point after co-host Miley Cyrus’s top appeared to come undone mid-performance, forcing her to swiftly turn around and head to the back of the stage to grab a red blazer. Rival CNN also entertained viewers after its host Andy Cohen vented his disapproval of the mayor, Bill de Blasio, saying “sayonara sucker” on the night he stepped down, as co-host Anderson Cooper sought to ease tensions in the background.
De Blasio was replaced by Eric Adams, who took his oath on stage in Times Square soon after the ball drop. He made a brief appearance earlier on the main stage to affirm the city’s resiliency. “It’s just great when New York shows the entire country how we come back,” he said. “We showed the entire globe what we’re made of. We’re unbelievable. This is an unbelievable city and, trust me, we’re ready for a major comeback because this is New York.”
Times Square is often referred to as the crossroads of the world, and city officials insisted on holding the marquee New Year’s Eve event to demonstrate the city’s resiliency even amid a resurgence of the coronavirus. “I would be lying if I said I’m not concerned,” said Sue Park, a Columbia University student who was one of the 15,000 allowed to watch in person. “Definitely I think it’s worth it to come and celebrate. It will just be more meaningful to be in the crowd.” Mary Gonzalez from Mexico City attended the event, standing a few feet away from the crowd. “I’m happy that 2021 is over because it caused a lot of problems for everybody,” said Gonzalez. “We hope that 2022 is much better than this year.” Covid-19 cases in the US have soared to their highest levels on record at more than 265,000 per day on average. New York City alone reported a record number of new, confirmed cases – nearly 44,000 – on Wednesday and a similar number on Thursday, according to New York state figures. Officials required those attending the spectacle to wear masks and show proof of vaccination.
“I look back and I see it as a sort of a stressful year, but it wasn’t a terrible year,” said Lynn Cafarchio, who braved the crowds to attend the festivities with her husband Pete. A New York City tour guide, she was unemployed for a spell as the economy was shuttered and tourism tanked. “We’re standing here glad that 2021 will soon be over,” she said, “but really positive about next year.” Even if the crowds were considerably smaller, people gathered across block after block to witness the ball drop. Nursing student Ashley Ochoa and her boyfriend, Jose Avelar, traveled from the central valley of California specifically to be at Times Square. “Covid did hold a lot of stuff back for me,” Ochoa said, “but I mean, I’m here today, so that’s what I’m thankful for.” Pandemic casts pall around world Around the world, the Omicron coronavirus variant dampened New Year festivities, with Paris cancelling its fireworks show, London relegating its to television, and Sydney cautiously welcoming 2022. Worldwide infections hit a record high over the past seven-day period, with an average of just over a million cases detected a day between 24 December and 30 December, up 100,000 on the previous peak posted on Wednesday, according to Reuters data. Deaths, however, have not risen in kind, bringing hope the new variant is less lethal. Around the globe, events were scaled back or cancelled outright, such as with the traditional fireworks over the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur. Midnight passed in Paris without a planned fireworks display or DJ sets, as city officials cancelled events planned on the Champs-Élysées following the advice of a scientific panel that declared mass gatherings would be too risky. In the Netherlands, where outside groupings of more than four people are banned, police dispersed several thousand people who had gathered at Amsterdam’s central Dam Square, ANP news agency reported. But in London, where a fireworks display and light show had been cancelled in October, officials announced on Friday the spectacle would come to life on the television screen, as Big Ben rang in the New Year for the first time since 2017 following a restoration.
BBC images of the fireworks showed very light vehicle traffic and virtually no in-person spectators. In the wake of encouraging data, Cape Town abruptly lifted a curfew just in time for the New Year, after South Africa became the first country to declare its Omicron wave had crested – and with no huge surge in deaths. “I’m just hoping that Cape Town goes back to the old Cape Town that we all knew about,” said Michael Mchede, manager of a Hard Rock Cafe by the white sands of Camps Bay Beach, who was thrilled to get the place ready to host an unexpected bash. Hours earlier, the Australian city of Sydney also feted the New Year with something like full swagger, as spectacular fireworks glittered in the harbour above the Opera House. People in Madrid queued for hours to get into the main Puerta del Sol square where celebrations went ahead with multiple security checkpoints, mandatory masks and capacity at 60% of normal levels. Saul Pedrero, a 34-year old clerk, made the trip from Barcelona, which has some of Spain’s strictest controls, including a 1am curfew. “It seems like another country. Here you can do everything and nobody says anything,” he said. A lavish firework display lit up the festivities, which Spaniards mark by stuffing 12 grapes into their mouths to accompany each chime of the clock striking midnight. In Asia, celebrations were mostly abridged or cancelled. In South Korea, a traditional midnight bell-ringing ceremony was cancelled for the second year, while festivities were banned in Tokyo’s glittering Shibuya entertainment district, and the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, took to YouTube to urge people to wear masks and limit numbers at parties. China, where the coronavirus first emerged in late 2019, was on high alert, with the city of Xi’an under lockdown and New Year events in other cities cancelled.

Whether you are seeking atonement for the excesses of Christmas or just craving something lighter, brighter and more refreshing, they are both vibrant and filling enough to eat for lunch or dinner without the need for any accompaniments. Chaat masala roast beetroots and shallots with coconut, cashews and curry leaf oil Earthy beetroot and shallots come alive with a sprinkle of deeply savoury chaat masala and a warming, south Indian-style tempered oil. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4 500g small beetroot, scrubbed and halved Rapeseed oil, to drizzle 2 tsp chaat masala Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 300g shallots, peeled and halved 30g unsweetened desiccated coconut 50g cashew nuts For the curry leaf oil 2 tbsp rapeseed oil 1 tsp white urid dal (split black gram) 1 tsp brown mustard seeds A pinch of asafoetida 15 fresh curry leaves 1 Kashmiri or mild chilli, broken into pieces Juice of 1 lime Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the beetroot in a roasting tin, lightly drizzle with a little oil, add half the chaat masala, season and roast for about 15 minutes. Add the shallots, drizzle over a little more oil and the remaining chaat masala, toss and roast for another 40 minutes, until the beets and shallots are tender and caramelised. Add the coconut and cashews, roast for three minutes more, until golden brown, then remove from the oven and set aside. Meanwhile, heat the oil for the tempering in a small frying pan. Sizzle the dal and mustard seeds, until the mustard seeds pop, then sprinkle in the asafoetida, curry leaves and chilli, and fry for a few seconds more. Transfer the beetroot and shallots to a platter, spoon over the oil and mix gently. Squeeze over the lime juice and serve. Sticky spiced honey-roast carrot and hazelnut salad with freekeh, dates and orange blossom water Dependable carrots rarely get star billing, but when roasted until caramelised with a spiced honey butter and perfumed with orange blossom water, they steal the show. Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4 For the carrots 300g small yellow carrots 300g small orange carrots (or 600g if you can’t find yellow carrots) 75g unsalted butter 1 tsp ground ginger 1 tsp ground cinnamon ½ tsp allspice 1 fat pinch saffron strands, pounded ½ tsp turmeric 1 generous grating nutmeg 2 fat garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 1 preserved lemon, skin and flesh very finely chopped 2 tbsp clear honey A few drops orange blossom water For the freekeh 200g freekeh, rinsed Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 60ml extra-virgin olive oil ½ lemon, juiced 60g dates, stoned and sliced (I can’t resist the ones from Zaytoun) 50g toasted hazelnuts, coarsely chopped Finely chopped flat-leaf parsley or chervil, to serve Heat the oven to 200 C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Scrape the carrots, cut them in half vertically and lay in a roasting pan. In a saucepan, melt the butter over a low heat with the ginger, cinnamon, allspice, saffron, turmeric, nutmeg, garlic and preserved lemon, stir and leave for five minutes, to infuse gently. Whisk in the honey, pour the mix all over the carrots, then cover tightly with foil and roast for 20 minutes. Remove the foil (keep it for later) and roast uncovered for a further 10-15 minutes, until the carrots are tender and caramelised. Remove from the oven, sprinkle over a few drops of orange blossom water, re-cover with the foil and leave the carrots to steam in the perfume. Meanwhile, dry roast the freekeh in a frying pan until toasty. Put 400ml water and a teaspoon of salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Sprinkle in the toasted freekeh, stir, bring back to a boil, then cover, turn the heat down low and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until the freekeh is tender and just about all the water has evaporated. Drain and transfer to a platter. Mix the oil, lemon juice and seasoning, then pour the dressing over the freekeh, toss to coat and leave to cool. Once cooled, add the dates and half the hazelnuts and herbs to the freekeh platter, and toss again. Top with the carrots, scatter over the remaining herbs and hazelnuts, and serve. Shaved turnips with silken tofu, chilli, sesame and soy Peppery turnips and radishes are balanced with the sweet sharpness of apples and a zesty soy dressing, while the tofu bulks up the protein to make a satiating and refreshing salad.

6159;6159;Last-ditch effort under way to stop corncrake extinction in Britain;2022-01-01T07:00:42Z;['Patrick Barkham'];['Birds', 'Animals', 'Environment', 'Wildlife', 'UK news', 'Scotland', 'Conservation', 'Endangered species', 'Endangered habitats', 'World news'];"The piercing “crex crex” call of the male corncrake once kept country people awake at night. But its last breeding strongholds are falling silent as this elusive migratory bird teeters on the brink of extinction in Britain. Despite a successful rescue effort that led to its numbers rallying on the islands of north-west Scotland, rising to 1,289 calling males in 2014, the corncrake’s population has since fallen by more than 30%, to just 850 calling birds in Scotland in 2021. A last-ditch effort to stop the corncrake vanishing is under way, with the Corncrake Calling project in Scotland encouraging farmers to cut hay meadows later in the year and in a corncrake-friendly way. In England, 100 corncrakes are being bred in captivity and released each year to re-establish them in the wild. The corncrake is an unusual species, a long-distance flying machine that soars through the skies from the Congo before spending all summer on the ground, eating insects and worms and rearing two broods of chicks hidden in long grass. The male’s repetitive, mechanical-sounding calls – which bequeath the bird its scientific name – once resounded across the land, day and night. But modern farming, with meadows cut mechanically early and often for silage, has led to corncrakes vanishing from most of Britain over one human lifetime. Populations have clung on in western Scotland, where traditional crofting gives the birds the insect-rich long grass through the spring and summer it requires. The species has been revived since 1993, when numbers fell to only 480 calling males in the UK. But a steady decline since 2014 is concerning conservationists who fear that there has been less uptake of government payments for corncrake-friendly farming in vital areas. Jane Shadforth, project manager for Corncrake Calling, an RSPB Scotland project to save the species supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, said: “Most crofters and farmers want to support wildlife and help nature and help the corncrake but they can only do that if they are getting the support they need from the government. They need to make a living and they need to be rewarded for farming in these wildlife-friendly ways.” In England, 97 corncrakes were this year bred in captivity by the Pensthorpe Conservation Trust and released on to the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) reserve at Welney in the Fens, as part of a Natural England-funded bid to restore the species that became extinct in England as a regular breeding bird in the 1970s.
Birds have been bred in captivity and released for 16 years to restore wild populations, which is particularly challenging with a migratory species. “There is no quick fix here,” said Chrissie Kelley, the head of species management at Pensthorpe. “Captive breeding is a huge learning curve and it does take years but I’m really hopeful that the Welney trial is going to show some success. The main aim is to get a self-sustaining population of wild birds.” Calling males have been heard again on the Ouse Washes around Welney and on the Nene Washes in Cambridgeshire in recent years, with wild birds successfully breeding at both locations. But another attempt to return the species to the Wensum valley in Norfolk has faltered because male returnees from Africa disperse too widely for their calls to be heard by females. Kelley said a good success rate for releasing a migratory bird is for more than 10% of the birds to return the following year. For the 97 released birds to produce seven or eight calling males next year would be a “good result”. “Captive breeding has its place – it can be a sticking plaster – but any reintroduction can only really work alongside habitat management,” said Kelley. “There’s no point releasing birds into habitat that can’t sustain them. These projects are long-term, very expensive and well-managed habitat is what it’s all about in the end.” In Scotland, Corncrake Calling is encouraging corncrake-friendly cutting. Traditional cutting from the field-edge inwards traps and kills corncrakes, who will not run or fly across a mown field. But if mowing begins in the centre of a field and works outwards, corncrakes and their chicks run to the safety of long grassy margins at the edge. RSPB Scotland’s annual survey has found that numbers have declined by more than 30% since 2014, but with important regional differences. While the population in the Outer Hebrides has increased by 9.9% since 2019, corncrakes on the Inner Hebrides have fallen by 12.2%. Since 2017, corncrakes have disappeared from Mull and their number plummeted on Islay from 75 to 26. There was better news on Lewis, where numbers increased from 75 to 89 while on South Uist they surged from 68 to 149. The reasons for these differences are likely to include changes in the uptake of agri-environment schemes. Managing land for corncrakes ideally requires farmers not to cut for silage or hay until 1 September to allow the birds to produce two broods in the long grass. A government scheme supporting corncrake-friendly farming, the Agri-Environment Climate Scheme, has been crucial in boosting corncrake populations in recent years but its future was in doubt until the Scottish government announced a three-year extension in autumn. But the climate emergency and more intensive farming in African wintering grounds are also challenging corncrakes. Many of Britain’s other long-distance migrants are also suffering drastic population declines, including the turtle dove, swift and willow warbler. “We don’t have the evidence at the moment to understand what might be occurring on that migratory route,” said Shadforth. “But we’re very keen to support the populations we have got in Scotland and enhance these by working with crofters and farmers here.”";https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/01/last-ditch-effort-stop-corncrake-extinction-britain
6160;6160;Be bad, better – from anger to laziness, how to put your worst habits to good use;2022-01-01T07:00:42Z;['Rebecca Seal'];['New year', 'Health', 'Psychology', 'Life and style', 'Mindfulness'];"We have the Babylonians to blame for making the new year a festival of self-flagellation – although their resolutions were more about appeasing gods than weight loss or cutting back on booze. (Sensibly, they carried out their rituals in spring in the Middle East, not the meteorological hellscape that is a British January.) John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, rekindled the idea in 1740, with an annual new year’s service of resolution – his included a promise never to laugh, which might explain why we also choose punishment over joy. But it doesn’t have to be this way. What if, instead of being motivated by guilt and shame, we leverage our worst habits to serve us better? By being intelligently, purposely lazier; less mindful, disorganised, slower (and with a bit of self-compassion), we might actually be more successful, productive and happier – but on our own terms. Here’s how. Make peace with your body Most of the body positivity movement is well intentioned – what’s not to like about being encouraged to love our bodies whatever they look like? “But body positivity was a movement created by fat and black women as a space to celebrate themselves because they didn’t see themselves represented,” says Chrissy King, activist and founder of the Body Liberation project. “And it’s been co-opted by thinner, straight white women emphasising a little bit of cellulite or fat rolls and saying, ‘I love myself anyway’. That was never the point of the movement.” As well as marginalising the founders, the visual dominance of women who are very close to the Europeanised beauty ideal can be painful and frustrating for those who live in bodies much further from it, as well as for anyone with severe body image issues. “The idea that you’re going to love your body is too far of a place to jump to,” King says. “[Body positivity] is setting some people up for failure.” Body neutrality is more achievable. “I can look in the mirror and just be at peace with my body,” says King. “I can learn not to say I look gross, or ugly. I can say this is the body I’m living in today, and I’m going to work towards being neutral about it.” Body liberation takes things a step further: “If you live in a black body, a trans body or a disabled body, you can love yourself with all your heart, but that doesn’t mean that you’re not going to face systemic oppression in the world because of your body. Body liberation is about asking: can I come to a place of acceptance and love for my own body, and work towards dismantling the systems of oppression that make it difficult for all of us to be able to do so?”
Be brilliantly lazy Kendra Adachi, podcast host and author of The Lazy Genius Way, is a productivity expert who isn’t necessarily into making people more productive. Instead, she’s interested in helping us figure out exactly which things in our lives matter to us (rather than to anyone else), how to do them well, and then being lazy (although cleverly so) about all the others – whether that’s laundry, morning routines or cooking (her next book is The Lazy Genius Kitchen). We should organise our lives in ways that reflect what’s genuinely important to us, she says – rather than to our parents, colleagues friends or neighbours – and let other, often very visible, things go, even when that’s socially uncomfortable. For example, for Adachi, it was accepting that she wouldn’t be the kind of mother who volunteered in her young children’s school, but could be the kind who donated money and materials; and realising that was just as valid. Learn to love negative emotions When your cat dies and someone breezily says, “Never mind, you can get a new cat,” that’s toxic positivity. “Two things go wrong with toxic positivity,” says Robert Biswas-Diener, positive psychologist and author of The Upside of Your Dark Side. “One is relational – when your friend comes to you wanting support, what they want and what you offer has to match, but often it doesn’t.” When we try to cheer someone up who actually just wants to be heard, “toxic positivity feels invalidating”. We’ve all felt this – when a parent or partner wants to solve our problem instead of letting us talk about it. They want to fix things in part because they can’t bear being near difficult feelings, and this is the second problem with toxic positivity: it often masks a distrust of uncomfortable or unpleasant emotions. “But there are a million good things about emotions – including negative ones such as fear, jealousy, anger, guilt and sadness. They are how we navigate the social world. [But] because people don’t spend any time tolerating negative emotions – they turn on Netflix or grab a bottle of wine – they get out of touch with them, and they parent their children to be out of touch with them, too.
“But if you suppress one emotion, you suppress them all,” Biswas-Diener says. Learning to feel difficult emotions makes it easier when things go wrong in future; we won’t be blindsided by both events and our own reactions to them. If you’ve never had to navigate sadness, anger or fear, it’s almost impossible to be resilient. For Biswas-Diener, this changed how he parented: instead of soothing and rescuing when things went wrong for his son, he affirmed his son’s anger or disappointment, meaning he grew up skilled at dealing with difficult feelings. We can do the same by giving ourselves permission to feel uncomfortable things such as sadness or anxiety, giving them time and space to occur, rather than always chasing them away with busyness, booze or digital distraction. Be moderately disorganised According to the book A Perfect Mess: The Hidden Benefits of Disorder, “neatness and organisation can exact a high price”. While absolute chaos isn’t helpful, messy systems are often more robust and flexible, according to authors David H Freedman and Eric Abrahamson, who believe that constantly keeping everything shipshape can be an unnecessary waste of time or money. “Moderately disorganised people, institutions and systems frequently turn out to be more efficient, resilient, creative and effective than highly organised ones,” they say. We’ve been socialised into thinking that being well organised is an unequivocal good, without ever asking whether that’s really true. Freedman and Abrahamson point out that Albert Einstein’s desk – among many others – was always in “stupendous disarray”, so next time someone officious tells you to tidy up your desk (or your sock drawer), remind them that if one of the greatest thinkers of all time thrived in a semi-shambles, then so can you.
Be less mindful “Traditionally, meditation was never thought of as something to create a moment of calm in the middle of crisis,” says Dr Julieta Galante, a neuroscience researcher at Cambridge University, who studies the upsides and downsides of mindfulness and meditation. “That is a western repurposing of it.” Mindfulness is not a mental health panacea – despite new Nice guidance suggesting that mindfulness should be recommended before medication for depression. Research suggests up to 25% of meditators experience negative effects, including anxiety, panic attacks, disrupted sleep and emotional or physical dissociation – exactly what we’re led to believe can be improved by mindfulness. Galante likens meditation to a drug with generally positive results for most people, but for which potential side-effects and interactions should be listed, rather than something anyone can start, via an app, with no trained support to fall back on if things go wrong. Which is not to say that mindfulness is bad, but it won’t make life better for everyone who tries it.
Instead, be more mindless. “You don’t want to be mindful every single second,” says Biswas-Diener, who also studies mindfulness. “Sometimes you want to jam out to some tunes while you’re driving, rather than notice every colour and smell. Daydreams, fantasies, those insights that you get in the shower, those are all from mindlessness.” Work less “We now have a century of research that shows overwork is counterproductive,” says Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, a four-day week campaigner and author of Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less. “It makes us less productive, less happy, increases the risks of burnout and of chronic disease; it negatively affects company performance, whether you are working in a factory, for the NHS or in a police station; you’re more likely to cut corners and to overlook small but crucial details that later on snowball into gigantic problems.” The only bits of the labour industry for which shorter working hours don’t make sense are, he says, “nonprofits trying to save the world or hedge funds trying to destroy the world, who have an essentially infinite labour source of 22-year-olds whose greed you can satisfy, whose idealism you can weaponise or whose ambition you can appeal to. For the rest of us, working less, but better, makes an awful lot of sense for economies and societies generally.”
Love your clutter “I’m someone who collects a lot of stuff,” says the maximalist designer Bethan Laura Wood, who wears and makes fantastically layered and colourful patterns. “For some people, my home, which has a lot of objects in it, feels uncomfortable. I find being in a space with less stuff in it uncomfortable – so it’s about what brings joy to you.” Wood believes we should declutter only if we really want to. “Don’t feel bad if you take all your stuff down, dust it, decide you like everything and put it all back.” In fact, there’s even a branch of psychology that examines the connection between our stuff, our identity and our sense of home. “Our possessions can take on a value that far exceeds their physical properties,” says psychologist Dr Christian Jarrett, author of Be Who You Want – Unlocking the Science of Personality Change. “We imbue our belongings with meaning. They become extensions of ourselves, or of the people who once owned them, connecting us to our past or loved ones. It would be unfair to expect yourself to dispose of your stuff without incurring emotional cost.” In other words, we don’t need to feel guilty about not doing a Marie Kondo and throwing our treasured clutter away. One of the pleasures of an invitation to someone’s home is seeing their mix of precious and incidental objects, telling the story of their life. Abandon meaningfulness “The pursuit of meaning is not fundamentally a bad thing,” says Wendy Syfret, author of The Sunny Nihilist: How a Meaningless Life Can Make You Truly Happy. “If you want to spend your whole life in a monastery, or pursuing enlightenment, good for you. But meaning has become so intensely commodified that now everything around us has to have meaning: your job has to be meaningful, your relationship has to be groundbreaking and every single consumer product is presented as life-changing – I saw a pack of tampons the other day that said, ‘This box is a revolution.’” When looked at this way, it’s obvious that meaning is a construct – and if absolutely everything is meaningful, then, arguably, nothing is. “[This] creates an incredible vortex of pressure that no one can live up to,” says Syfret, who wants to help us realise our own insignificance, but cheerfully. For Syfret and other optimistic nihilists, nihilism is about being free from pressure rather than hopelessness or being selfish, and actually powers her activism. “People tell us we should care about things to get us to invest ourselves in them – particularly work, and often as a way to get us to work harder for less money. So when we’re offered meaning – which is not the same as quantifiable value [tampons are valuable, not meaningful] – let’s ask: what is the intention of the person that’s giving me this message? Is this actually a message that’s trying to coercively control me?”
Don’t diet “Before you try diets or gruelling exercise programmes, spend one week treating yourself and your body the way that you would want the person you love most to speak to themselves,” says Shahroo Izadi, a behaviour change expert and author of The Last Diet, about how to improve our relationships with food and our body. “You may well notice that you are much softer with yourself, you forgive yourself quickly, you’re compassionate and you take a much more holistic approach to the way you treat your body.” Many of Izadi’s clients focus on the outcome – weight loss – as opposed to adjusting their behaviour. “People assume that the result will be enough to teach them a whole set of new skills. I often tell them to imagine they’ve already lost weight, and that their task is keeping it off and still enjoying their life. That’s when they start realising that the way to keep off lost weight in the long term is to move away from the all-or-nothing, I’ve-blown-it mentality and to not moralise their food choices. Because blame, shame and guilt are so often the feelings that people need comfort from – and their comfort is food.” What can we do to create a healthier relationship with food? Have a conversation with yourself, Izadi says. “For many of us, it isn’t until we do some internal inquiry that we realise diets and other unhelpful nutritional ‘rules’ have left us feeling guilty after [eating] what we’ve been taught to consider are ‘bad’ food choices.” This is not how we deserve to experience food, she says. “For those who want to stop comfort eating or eating to change uncomfortable feelings (such as shame and guilt), it’s completely counterproductive. Start gently factchecking, debating with and attempting to soften that voice.”
Embrace being single “Women get in touch with me every day saying, ‘Oh, you look so happy. Should I leave my husband?’” says Helen Thorn, one half of the Scummy Mummies comedy duo and author of Get Divorced: Be Happy. “Now, I can’t make that decision for you, but I can tell you that divorce is the best thing that ever happened to me. I’m having a lovely time, all of the time. I mean, I wouldn’t recommend your husband having an affair, but you know, that’s OK.” Thorn is not against marriage. “And I’m not anti-love.” But now that’s she’s divorced and a single parent, she is more clear-sighted about how, sometimes, people succumb to pressure to be in a couple, or to stay in a relationship for the sake of children. “Being single was the thing that I feared the most. It was absolutely the thing that I thought would break me. But love comes in many forms. The happiness that I thought marriage would give me, the completeness, the satisfaction, is what I’ve got from being single. I’ve got everything I need.” She says life (and parenting) is easier and involves less compromise than when she was married. “Romance is lovely when it works, but it’s as hard as being single in many ways. I’ve created this life for myself where I’m happy – and now I don’t have to worry about someone complaining about how I cook my pasta.” Use your anger for good “In the next 365 days, there will definitely be anger,” says Professor David Lebel, who studies the effects of so-called negative emotions at the Joseph M Katz Graduate School of Business. “The question is how you’re going to handle it. There are times when anger is functional, and there are times when it’s not. There’s a big difference between in-the-moment anger, and using that anger at some future time. So, do you explode at a work meeting? Or do you think, ‘What that person said is upsetting. I’m going to address it, but not now.’ You can’t really tell anger to go away, because it’s too strong – it’s high energy, it’s not comfortable and it’s going to take some time to be calm.”
Anger is useful, Lebel says. “Its function is to change a situation – something is disrupted, that’s why you feel anger. So the first step is just labelling it: ‘I’m angry about this.’ If you don’t know what you’re angry about, you can’t really make it functional. Then I tell people to draw on that anger in future – not to match the intensity, but to supply energy [when you do speak up], moving away from reactionary blow-ups and towards more proactive responses.” Using anger positively means harnessing it for good, such as improving diversity at work, or helping your partner and child navigate the fallout from a nasty row, rather than wading in while it’s happening, taking sides and intensifying a conflict. Care less “I’m a very ambitious, organised, successful person,” says Sarah Knight, author of the bestselling No Fucks Given books and You Do You, an alternative self-help series about putting yourself first and giving less of a damn about other people’s expectations of your behaviour. Knight moved to the Dominican Republic after realising that her job in publishing was forcing her not to be herself, and giving her severe panic attacks. “People look at what I do, and the whole No Fucks Given ethos, and they think, ‘She has no direction, no commitments, no limitations.’ But that’s actually not true, and part of the reason is that I don’t live the way culture and society tells me that I have to. A very big part of what I do is reminding people that it’s OK to pull back, it’s OK to say no, it’s OK to say that’s not important to me. You get to decide, in your career, in your marriage, in your art, as a parent. You’re allowed to decide that you don’t give a fuck about being organised, you’re allowed to decide you don’t give a fuck about being slender, you don’t give a fuck about getting a promotion. You don’t have to measure yourself against anybody else’s standards.” Rest better “Rest is good for us cognitively and physically,” says Claudia Hammond, author of The Art of Rest, psychology lecturer and presenter of All in the Mind, on Radio 4. “The key is to find what feels truly restful to you, and not feel guilty about it,” she says. “Many people find sitting on the sofa doing nothing quite hard. You don’t need to buy expensive candles to put around the bath before it can feel restful; you don’t have to have a spa weekend. Some find walking or even running restful – they can’t rest until they’ve exhausted their body, they can’t clear their mind.” Hammond recommends activities that occupy your hands but let your mind wander, such as jigsaws or gardening, listening – really listening – to music, spending empty time alone (by choice) and giving yourself permission to not achieve anything in particular. Why do we feel so bad about resting? “It’s a cultural issue – we’re taught at school not to doodle or stare out of the window, and as adults busyness has status; there are experiments that demonstrate that we think busy people are more organised and more successful.”
Read a book (and watch telly) Guardian TV critic Lucy Mangan has never been caught up in self-improvement. “I’m resistant and stubborn about people making me do stuff, especially now I’m older,” says the writer, whose new novel is called Are We Having Fun Yet? “I’m not about to give in to people who say I should have a side hustle or improve myself.” In the face of a million well-publicised hobby options – macrame! netball! pottery! – it’s easy to forget that you don’t have to have a skills-based sideline in order to be a fully realised human. You could just read a book. “All the reasons we encourage children to read don’t disappear as we get older. It still increases empathy and gives us the ability to recognise and articulate our own interior world (and television is in the same direction of travel, even if it doesn’t go quite so far),” Mangan says. What should we pick up, if we’ve fallen out of the habit? “Something joyful such as Wodehouse, or warm and lovely like Maeve Binchy. But don’t go looking for something you think you should read. If I catch you looking at the Booker long list, I’ll smack you in the face.” Ignore people (for longer) Many of us already know we should use our phones less, but the thing that sucks us back in is often what feels like an urgent need to reply to people. The pressure is all in our heads, according to Emma Gannon, whose new book is called (Dis)Connected: How to Stay Human in an Online World. “We think other people care more than they do,” she says. Many of the people she spoke to for the book were scared of turning off their notifications. “We’re frightened that we’re going to miss out, and that no one will notice we’ve gone. We moan about notifications, but [many of us] don’t turn them off because we like them and they make us feel busy and important.” And of course, the more we respond, the more we get back in response. Gannon recommends “retraining” the people in our texts, DMs and inboxes not to expect quick responses. “We behave as if replying is a task we can complete, but we can never, ever, ever finish it. So step away.” Stay away from resolutions “Approaching yourself with as much kindness as possible, with as much love as possible, is really, as far as I can see, our only choice, especially now,” says Jeffrey Marsh. Marsh is an activist whose life-affirming videos have been watched over a billion times, and author of the bestselling How to Be You, part memoir of growing up non-binary in rural Pennsylvania, part manifesto for global self-acceptance. “If you hate your guts into losing 20 pounds, will you end up 20 pounds lighter? Maybe, maybe not. But what you will have practised is hating your guts.” How do we learn self-kindness? “To me, the essential question is: will I be able to be kind to myself? Self-hate is the engine that drives most people’s resolutions. It’s easy to say, ‘I’m going to lose 20 pounds.’ It is unfamiliar to say, ‘I’m going to deeply love myself, no matter what.’ It may be the hardest thing to learn in one’s lifetime, but it can also be the most loving, beautiful, fun and exciting process of one’s life.”";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/be-bad-better-from-anger-to-laziness-how-to-put-your-worst-habits-to-good-use

6163;6163;What the UK car and home insurance shake-up means for the price you pay;2022-01-01T07:00:41Z;['Miles Brignall'];['Insurance', 'Money', 'Insurance industry', 'Business', 'UK news'];"The biggest shake-up to the insurance industry for decades takes place on New Year’s Day, when insurers will be banned from quoting policyholders a higher price to renew their home or motor insurance than they would offer a new customer. The move will leave some customers better off, but others look likely to pay more. What’s this all about? After years of complaints that customers who regularly switched insurer were paying significantly lower premiums than those that renewed automatically, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said both sets of customers must now be offered the same price. The FCA had found evidence that insurers were attracting new customers with artificially low prices and then increasing premiums in subsequent years – a practice known in the trade as “price walking”. Insurers were also found to be cynically targeting customers who they thought were less likely to switch in future. This move is designed to end the two-tier insurance market that has grown up as a result. How will it work? If the regulations are applied as intended, a car or home insurance customer receiving their renewal notice at the end of the year will be quoted the same premium as if they apply to switch to that company from a rival insurer. Until now, insurers offered generous discounts in the first year – often at or below cost – to attract customers in the hope they would be able to increase their premiums in subsequent years. However, it is a bit more complicated than it first appears. Insurers must prove, on aggregate, they charge new and existing customers getting insurance via the same “channel” at the same price. In effect, this means that insurers can still charge different rates for customers who use different price comparison sites (channels) but they can’t favour new customers over existing ones.
What does this mean for prices? The move looks likely to be bad news for households that switched their home and car insurers each year – chasing the lowest new-customer premiums. There was nothing to stop people switching suppliers each year taking advantage of the discounted deals – and that is what millions of people have been doing. This group will undoubtedly end up paying more each year to insure their homes and cars, as those discounts will no longer be there. Conversely, the FCA said it expects loyal customers who renew policies automatically to save £120 a year each. Martin Lewis, the founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, and one of those who helped to turn UK consumers into a nation of switchers, said: “My best guess is firms won’t just cut renewal prices to match those for newbies. Rates will meet nearer the middle as happened in 2012, when insurers were barred from gender price discrimination. This will mean savings from switching are likely to relatively reduce. “We’re still unsure of how this will work exactly, but prices for switchers are very likely to be relatively higher for January.” Overall, insurance prices will still rise (and sometimes fall as happened in the pandemic) but they should shift equally for all customers – rather than just those who switch regularly. Will it still be worth doing a price comparison at renewal? Yes and this is still the best advice. Insurers tend to target different segments of the market, and some may still want to attract you as a customer and will quote accordingly. The big savings gained by switching will probably be a thing of the past, but there will still be savings on offer. Expect insurers to continue to offer deals via the price comparison websites such as Moneysupermarket, ComparetheMarket and so on. New entrants will still offer attractive prices to grab customers. It is worth noting that price walking has been particularly prevalent in the home insurance market where those renewing policies were often charged double or even triple what they would have paid as a new customer of the same firm. Anyone who has not swapped home insurance in recent years is advised to do a price comparison when they renew. Guardian Money is regularly contacted by people shocked having just discovered what their elderly parents or friends have been paying for their home insurance. Households have found themselves paying close to £1,000 a year for cover that could be bought elsewhere, or even from the same provider, for £250.";https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/01/uk-car-and-home-insurance-price-insurers-deals
6164;6164;Most hangover ‘cures’ have little evidence behind them, study finds;2022-01-01T06:00:42Z;['Nicola Davis'];['Hangover cures', 'Alcohol', 'Health', 'Science', 'UK news', 'Health & wellbeing'];"A thumping headache, a tongue that feels like a carpet and a strong sense of queasiness and regret – it is a condition with which many will be all too familiar on New Year’s Day. But while it may seem tempting to reach for a hangover “cure”, researchers have chosen New Year’s Day to tell us that most will offer cold comfort. Scientists say they have evaluated studies looking at 23 different substances alleged to help prevent or treat a hangover, but found all of the “remedies” had low-quality evidence for how well they worked. The study revealed only seven of the substances showed some sign of potential benefits for overall hangover symptoms, with participants giving a lower hangover symptom score, recorded as a percentage, compared with a placebo. “A hundred percent is really bad. So they have the worst hangover known to mankind,” said Dr Emmert Roberts, a co-author of the research based at the National Addiction Centre at King’s College London. Of these seven substances the largest and strongest effects were seen for clove extract, the anti-inflammatory drug tolfenamic acid, and pyritinol – a substance resembling two vitamin B6 molecules attached together. Participants taking a clove extract pill while drinking had, on average, a hangover symptom score of 19% compared with 43% for those who took a placebo pill. While the researchers said there would be limited harm in using such substances, it seems much more research is needed to explore whether they actually help the morning after the night before. The clove extract study, for instance, involved just 16 participants. Writing in the journal Addiction, Roberts and colleagues report how they looked at 21 studies, all assessing different alleged hangover cures, with 386 participants.
Nevertheless the list has some surprising gaps. As Roberts notes, while some may find painkillers such as aspirin or paracetamol help with a hangover, neither has been studied for this purpose in randomised control trials. Among other limitations, the team notes that eight of the studies only involved male participants, while none involved adults over the age of 65. It is also not clear whether the findings of studies in one country would apply elsewhere. Furthermore, the team points out many of the studies had “significant degrees of imprecision in outcome measures of treatment effect” while 16 of the 21 studies involved sample sizes of fewer than 30 participants. Roberts suggested when it comes to hangovers, prevention is better than cure. “The most sensible thing to do is either to abstain from alcohol or drink in moderation,” he said. For those who are planning to drink more, Roberts said staying hydrated was likely to help – although, it was “not a surefire way to avoid a hangover”. Roberts has also stocked up on another option. “I have purchased a bottle of clove extract,” he said. Prof David Nutt, of Imperial College London and the government’s former chief drug adviser – who was not involved in the work – said the only way to stop a hangover was to drink less or consume alcohol-free alternatives. Nutt has developed the alcohol-free spirit Sentia, a drink that is claimed can make those who drink it feel “a mild sense of lightness and relaxation” without resulting in a hangover. “Hangover is probably the least researched major health impairment – costing the UK economy over £10bn a year,” he said.";https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/most-hangover-cures-have-little-evidence-behind-them-study-finds

6166;6166;Weatherwatch: when rivers froze over in 1795;2022-01-01T06:00:42Z;['Paul Brown'];['Environment'];One upside from the climate crisis is that winters in northern Europe are warmer. The coldest January since 1659, when records began in England, was in 1795 when rivers including the Thames and Severn froze over. The temperature barely rose above freezing all month. Country parsons, who fed poor people at Christmas, gave them a shilling each to buy food for January. Grain was in already in short supply because of a dry summer and hunger became so widespread that the following spring there were bread riots. In his diaries, James Woodforde, a country parson in Weston Longeville in Norfolk, who was troubled by gout on very cold nights, said that even the fire in the parlour made no difference. He worried that poor people were suffering badly because their vegetables were ruined by frost. On Saturday 25 January, there was a terrible storm that took the thatch off the barn and stripped the tiles from his roof. He still managed to dine “on a couple of boiled rabbits, beef steaks etc but the wind was so tempestuous we made a very poor dinner”. Three days later there was still a “very severe frost indeed. It freezes sharply within doors.” He also notes: “Two women froze to death Saturday last going home from Norwich market to their home.”;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/01/weatherwatch-when-rivers-froze-over-in-1795

What were you hoping for? Someone funny and up for a good time. In a perfect world a doctor – we can all dream. First impressions? Great smile and charming. He clearly had a free-spirited sense of self. What did you talk about? Growing up in the countryside and whether London was an amazing place to live or a terrible one. Our reality TV guilty pleasures – his being a Below Deck man and my love for Made in Chelsea. Any awkward moments? Maybe when he said he was vegan and I ordered a steak. Good table manners? For sure: he kept my glass full.
Best thing about Joe? His clear passion for everything he has done and wants to do.
Would you introduce him to your friends? For sure – not in a romantic sense but as someone to challenge their beliefs and add a new perspective. Describe Joe in three words? Idealistic, witty and caring. What do you think he made of you? That I was good laugh – even if there was no real attraction. Did you go on somewhere? We had a cocktail at the restaurant after dinner. And … did you kiss? No. I don’t think either of us had a strong desire to. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? I’d have encouraged him to order a pudding – I missed my favourite part of an evening. Marks out of 10? 8. Would you meet again? In a group of friends – sure.
Joe on Max
What were you hoping for? A glitzy night out with someone new. First impressions? Great – he could talk just as loud and fast as me, which was reassuring. What did you talk about? Dating closeted men and fancying straight ones. And we both despaired about dating apps in the countryside. Any awkward moments? None that weren’t resolved by his fun spiel about growing up in Weston-super-Mare.
Good table manners? Excellent. He apologised repeatedly for getting the steak.
Best thing about Max? He knows what he likes: enthusiasm for the licence fee, that “one good bar” in Aberdeen, and living in Chelsea. Would you introduce him to your friends? Yes, if he’d schlep to south-east London. Describe Max in three words? In his element. What do you think he made of you? He got the measure of me, literally. He looked me over and guessed my suit measurements, a skill honed over years working in retail. Did you go on somewhere? No. We opted for one more cocktail. And … did you kiss? It never materialised. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? I’d have sniffed out a dive bar nearby. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again?

6168;6168;Tim Dowling: my 2021 in numbers – minus the two courgettes I poisoned my family with;2022-01-01T06:00:41Z;['Tim Dowling'];['Life and style', 'Family'];"Last New Year’s Day I found myself in the mildly paradoxical state of being relieved 2020 was finally over while still dreading the prospect of 2021. Twelve months on, I’m in the exact same position: the only thing preventing me from being glad to see the back of last year is the distinct possibility that 2022 will be worse still. A lot of this is, of course, subjective. The only way to accurately assess the goodness or badness of one particular year in relation to another is through the prism of cold, hard numbers. Here, then, is my personal statistical index for the year 2021, using the latest available figures: 100 Percentage of my adult offspring presently living with me, up from 66.6% this time last year. Initially, I considered this to be a 50% improvement – I was relieved to have them all under one roof, and it was also reassuring to have a generous amount of muscle in residence in times of need. But a stricter cost-benefit analysis – ie how much you spend feeding them versus the number of times you need help carrying a safe upstairs – proves a full house to be an expensive luxury.
27 Number of non-toxic courgettes successfully grown. In many respects it was a bumper season, but nobody remembers all those lovely, pale yellow, not even slightly poisonous courgettes I grew last year; just the two green ones that nearly sent my entire family to A&E after just a few bites. As far as I could work out, the poisoned variety were the result of accidental cross-pollination leading to a bad batch of commercial seed that produced courgettes laced with natural toxins that can cause – and I’m here to tell you, do cause – diarrhoea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Also occasionally hair loss and death – rarely in both cases, although absolutely anything seemed possible that night. After that fateful event nobody would eat any courgette grown by me, even after I licked the end of each one to prove their non-toxicity. Now I lick the end of all courgettes, even the ones from the store, so I suppose a lesson of sorts has been learned.
6 Number of gigs the band I’m in played in 2021. It’s a lot more than the single gig we played between lockdowns in 2020, but rather less than the nine we were originally scheduled to play. One gig was cancelled and rescheduled three times, until it finally went ahead in October. We already have more than 20 gigs lined up for this year. I should probably practise. 4 Total number of injections received. This represents a huge increase over the previous year (0), the year before that (0) and the year before that (0). In fact, it’s almost certainly an annual record. I got my first vaccination jab in March and my second one in May. When I had the booster in November they asked me if I’d had a flu jab yet, and when I said no they gave me both, one in each arm. I walked out of that community centre feeling invincible, and woke up the next day feeling like crap.
1,063 Amount of money, to the nearest pound, that I spent on Covid tests in 2021. Again, it’s a big jump from 2020, when I spent nothing. I suppose one should average the total cost of testing across the whole pandemic, but in this case the entire sum was expended in an effort to get my family to the US for my father’s 100th birthday, the bulk of it on a single, ruinous trip to a drive-through testing centre in the States, 48 hours before our return. 19 By my reckoning, the total number of different names the old cat called me in 2021 in a bid to get my attention so I would feed it, or turn on the tap so it could drink from it. Those names included Mairead, Muireann, Meryl, Noirin, Noel and Joan, plus some minor spelling variations, none of which were even close to my actual name. Then, in August, the old cat died. RIP James. 1 New cats acquired. I thought it was too soon to replace the old cat with a new kitten, but I was overridden by four votes to one. It arrived in October and proceeded to wreak havoc upon our household. Months later, it still jumps out at me from hidden corners and it still stands on my plate while I’m eating. At least it doesn’t call me names. I sort of miss that, to be honest.

6169;6169;How to turn leftover alcohol into vinegar – recipe | Waste not;2022-01-01T06:00:41Z;['Tom Hunt'];['Food', 'Food waste', 'Environment', 'Wine', 'Pickling, fermenting and preserving', 'Beer', 'Cider'];"“Vinegar can be made from any fermented alcohol or solution of fermentable sugars,” says the fermentation expert and author Sandor Katz, whose recipe in his book The Art of Fermentation I have adapted here. “The word vinegar comes from [the French] ‘vin-aigre’, which means ‘sour wine’. That’s why people don’t like to drink the dregs of wine, because after 24 hours they start to turn vinegary.” Katz explains how simple it is to make vinegar: “Take leftover wine, and put it in a jar that gives it a high ratio of surface area to volume” – in other words, in something that’s not full all the way to the top. “And make sure it has good access to oxygen: put a cloth over it and the process will just happen. It will happen faster if you add some sort of vinegar starter, but you don’t really need to do that, because the acidobacteria are everywhere.” Homemade vinegar from leftover alcohol Katz recently brought out a new book called Sandor Katz’s Fermentation Journeys that is full of wonderful stories and recipes from around the world, as well as all sorts of traditional fermentation techniques. Fermentation is a vital tool that can help prevent food waste through preservation. For a better success rate, I’ve included vinegar with its mother (AKA raw live vinegar) in today’s recipe, but Katz assures me that it isn’t necessary and that vinegar can be made simply by leaving alcohol to oxidise. Dregs of leftover wine will make wine vinegar, cider will make apple cider vinegar and beer malt vinegar; mixtures work, too. Buy vinegar with the mother at big supermarkets or online, and once you’ve made one batch, keep some aside with the mother to seed your next batch of vinegar without any extra outlay at all. Live vinegar with the mother is a highly valued food product, and, considering how easy it is to make vinegar, I’m going to start making a continuous batch at home using leftover wine. Katz told me how to do this: “I have an Italian-American friend called Ricky Boscarino, who has a four- to six-litre cask with a little spigot and a hole at the top for making vinegar. If you have a bottle of wine at his house and there’s a bit left at the bottom at the end of the evening, he pours it into the cask. Then, when he’s making a salad dressing or whatever, he’ll just open up the spigot, release some vinegar and use that. He does this as a continuous process, rather than making it in batches.” 300ml leftover alcohol (beer, cider and/or wine diluted with the same amount of water) 100ml raw vinegar (ie with the mother) 1 x 500ml wide-mouthed jar (500ml or larger) Cheesecloth and a rubber band Narrow-neck bottles, to store If you’re making wine vinegar, dilute the wine with an equal volume of water first, but cider and beer are fine just as they are. In a large, wide-mouthed jar, mix three parts beer, cider or diluted wine with one part vinegar with its mother. Cover the top of the jar with a piece of cheesecloth, seal in place with a rubber band, then store in a warm place – in an airing cupboard or near a radiator, say – and out of direct sunlight for a few weeks, until the gluey smell dissipates and the contents taste properly acidic. A film, or “mother”, will form on the surface, so once you’ve made your first batch, save this mother and enough vinegar as the base for your next batch. As soon as the vinegar is ready, decant into a sterilised bottle (or bottles), seal tightly and store in a cool place. Enjoy immediately, or store for six months (or longer) for a superior taste.";https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/01/how-to-turn-leftover-alcohol-into-vinegar-recipe-zero-waste-cooking

6171;6171;I’ve been lied about and others get death threats. Covid has shown the power of misinformation | Devi Sridhar;2022-01-01T06:00:40Z;['Devi Sridhar'];['Coronavirus', 'Social media', 'Infectious diseases', 'Media', 'Digital media', 'UK news', 'Protest'];"Before the experience of the past two years of Covid-19, I had assumed that a deadly viral outbreak would be quickly contained by governments. Especially in rich countries with good health systems, public health infrastructure, economic support packages and trust in public institutions. I thought there would be general consensus on what needed to be done, and that people would get their information directly from experts working in universities and public health authorities. I mean, who would want to risk getting a deadly infection? Now, I wonder if an even more deadly virus – like a pandemic-ready version of Mers, a coronavirus which killed 20% of those it infected in South Korea before being contained in 2015 – would be treated the same way as Covid-19. Would thousands of people show up at protests because theyhad read on Facebook that Mers was a hoax? Would there be similar scenarios at every pandemic after that? After my experience of actively working through the Covid-19 pandemic, these possibilities seem horrifyingly possible. One of the most unpredictable aspects of the past two years, and one of the most disheartening, has been the rise of widespread misinformation. The line between facts and lies has disintegrated. Years of experience in infectious disease control and a doctorate or medical degree quickly became equivalent to the influencer on YouTube or Facebook who has garnered hundreds of thousands of followers by promoting exciting-but-untrue “facts”. You can see this clearly in the rise of anti-vaccine sentiment, where popular conspiracists share stories about alleged side-effects such as how vaccines are microchipping our bodies, or changing our DNA, or poisoning us. This has gone far beyond social media chatter and personal resistance, becoming an aggressive real-world campaign that has led to protests at hospitals, health workers being attacked and scientists being mailed death threats. I’ve personally learned that lies spread faster than truth. People have written entire blogs attacking my expertise and sharing clear falsehoods – such as the claim that I have no published scientific papers, or that I’m a global plant by the World Economic Forum or Gates Foundation, or that I am a philosopher rather than a scientist (because I have a DPhil from Oxford). It’s easy to laugh at such obvious untruths, until it sinks in that this clickbait gets shared thousands of times. People believe it, and then they too share it. And there is no way to counter every single falsehood. These lies carry more weight among some internet communities than the fact that Edinburgh University evaluated my expertise and granted me a professorship. I always try to counter these claims by sharing my funding sources, being transparent about what data I’m using for my analyses and advice, and acknowledging that while I might get things wrong, I always have tried to conduct myself with integrity and academic professionalism. But this isn’t always enough. There are many people voicing strong opinions who aren’t constrained the same way. Lots of politicians and leaders are seeking popularity, often by actively opposing basic public health measures. There are social media celebrities who build followings by sharing emotionally appealing lies. There are even academics who staked a claim with a certain camp early in the pandemic, and haven’t shifted their thinking despite new tools such as vaccines, mass testing and antivirals becoming available.
The power of misinformation can be seen in the number of people appearing in hospitals, desperately sick with Covid-19 and struggling to breathe, who still say it is a hoax, and don’t believe that this is an actual virus (like many other viruses) that infects humans and makes us ill. A basic fact that somehow is harder for them to believe than the idea that this is a global conspiracy for government takeover of citizens. How is someone supposed to sift facts and real data from manufactured and glitzy stories on social media? There is little to no regulation of quality of data or sources on the internet. Some of the small lessons I’ve learned are to explain science clearly and simply so that it is comprehensible to everyone, and to try to reach people in small groups or at an individual level; fighting misinformation on social media is a losing battle. Important too is for experts to engage with TV, radio and newspapers, as mass media still carries considerable influence. Now is the time to understand and address these problems. I’ve written a book – out next year – about the experience of advising government and trying to communicate the fast-moving science and policy of the pandemic to the public, and hopefully how to do everything better next time. Reflecting and thinking ahead isn’t a theoretical exercise because we know that the next pandemic is coming – whether it is Mers or Sars or something else – and there may not be a quiet time to do it. Like everything else in the past two years, we have to learn these lessons as we go.

6173;6173;Decision to exempt NSW health workers from Covid isolation reflects hospitals’ ‘desperate situation’;2022-01-01T06:00:08Z;['Donna Lu'];['Health', 'Coronavirus', 'New South Wales', 'Australia news'];"Doctors say a decision to exempt health workers in New South Wales from self-isolating if they are close contacts reflects an “extremely desperate situation”, with warnings the policy change will increase the Covid risk to hospital patients. NSW Health announced late on Friday night that in “exceptional circumstances”, frontline workers who are asymptomatic close contacts will be exempt from having to self-isolate for seven days, to avoid disruption to key services. The exemption “allows these close contacts to leave self-isolation to attend their workplace, provided they have been identified by their employer as critical to the service and cannot work from home.”
Dr Chris Moy, the vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, said the policy change was indicative of the “enormous stress” the NSW health system was under “because of the increasing number of cases … Just as much, it’s because of the number of staff who are having to be furloughed.” Covid hospitalisations in NSW were currently lower than at the peak of the Delta wave, but had more than doubled in the last week. On Saturday, there were 901 people in the state hospitalised with the virus, compared to 388 on Christmas Day. The state now had one of the highest rates of Covid in the world. “It’s not just about the number of beds [taken], it’s about the number of staff to be able to safely provide healthcare,” Moy told Guardian Australia. “We’re having entire teams getting wiped out, essentially.” As of 30 December, 2,510 health workers across the state were self-isolating, NSW Health confirmed to Guardian Australia. On Friday, a leaked memo revealed St George hospital in Sydney’s south was already planning to fly in nurses in an attempt to deal with staffing shortages and surging Covid cases. Moy said that among medical professionals there was “a level of desperation which is not reflected in comments that the health system is holding up well”.
Prof Nick Talley, a physician and editor-in-chief of the Medical Journal of Australia, agreed. “Obviously, we’re in a very difficult, perilous situation arguably, despite all the assurances that the hospital system was robust and everything was going to be fine,” he said. Talley said the policy change was a means to “urgently deal with a major staffing matter which doesn’t seem to be fillable any other way”. “People will suffer or even die if we don’t have people caring for them in hospital, but of course it will have some negative downsides that could be very serious as well,” he said. The self-isolation exemption would “put not only hospital workers at more risk from their colleagues, but also patients in hospital will be at higher risk of catching Covid,” Talley said. “It’s a dreadful situation to have ended up in and it was potentially preventable if we hadn’t let go so early.”
A senior doctor working in Sydney, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the situation in his health district as “at crisis point”. “Things are absolutely terrible, with a combination of high numbers of patients and staff being off, furloughed or sick,” he said, adding there were high presentations to the emergency department and “ramping” – patients having to wait in ambulances because the department was full. He said though there were less Covid patients in the intensive care unit compared to the peak of the Delta wave, staffing shortages meant the service had to “significantly cut back” on bed capacity. Omicron is linked to a substantially reduced risk of hospitalisation and admission into intensive care, but experts said the variant’s transmissibility could still threaten to overwhelm the health system. “As cases rise massively, there are still some people … who will need hospitalisation,” Talley said. “If you’ve got a huge number of people infected, that’s a very significant load.” Moy said: “A large number [of people] are ending up in hospital at the same time, but also a large number of staff are getting infected at the same time, and they’ve been taken out of play.” To reduce the peak, Moy said it was necessary to reconsider restrictions, and to maximise TTIQ – test, trace, isolate, quarantine. “The problem at the moment is that [the testing system] is barely functioning. “What you’re trying to do is buy time … to get boosters in arms,” he said. NSW Health said in a statement that “staff furloughed because they’ve been a close contact with a Covid-19 case are not necessarily ill or presenting symptoms when they’re placed into isolation.” “If these workers develop any Covid-19 symptoms they must immediately seek a PCR test and not attend the workplace until a negative result is received. They are also required to comply with risk-management strategies put in place by their employer. “The safety of staff working at NSW Health is of the utmost importance.”";https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/01/decision-to-exempt-nsw-health-workers-from-covid-isolation-reflects-hospitals-desperate-situation
6174;6174;Why does Austria stay silent over dual national’s arrest six years ago in Iran?;2022-01-01T05:00:39Z;['Patrick Wintour'];"['Iran', 'Austria', 'Europe', 'Middle East and north Africa', 'World news', 'Iran nuclear deal', ""Iran's nuclear programme"", 'European Union']";"Six years ago on New Year’s Day, an Iranian-Austrian IT businessman said goodbye to his wife and three children and boarded a flight from Vienna to Tehran via Istanbul. Kamran Ghaderi was due to return five to six days later, but instead, on 2 January 2016, he was arrested and has now spent six years in Evin prison in Tehran. In October 2016, he was sentenced to 10 years for spying for a foreign country at a trial in which neither he nor his lawyer were able to say more than two words. His sentencing was based on a confession he gave under what his wife, Harika, says was torture, in the belief she might be in danger. No written judgment has ever been given to his family. “The effect on our three children – that is the most painful aspect of this story,” says Harika in an interview. “I cannot comfort them. My daughters were nine and 12 years old. Now they are 15 and 18. Our boy was two years old and now he is eight. He does not remember his father and he was asking every day, ‘where is my father?’ I showed photos with him when he was a baby, but he thought his father was dead. When he was four years old, he asked whether his father was in prison. “The older children were scared they might be arrested too. They are still careful to see if anyone is following them.”
Harika lost weight until she became “a skeleton”, and despite taking pills found it difficult to sleep for more than two hours at a stretch. On this harrowing anniversary she recalls every aspect of his disappearance. In advance of his visit, there had been no reason to be wary. Ghaderi – who had left Iran in 1983 to study electrical engineering in Vienna – was not a political activist. He had been on many business trips across the Middle East as an IT consultant, and in 2015, after the Iran nuclear deal, he went on an official Austrian business delegation to Tehran led by the then Austrian president Heinz Fischer. Relations were on the up. Normally on his trips to Tehran he stayed with his elderly mother. Harika says: “On the first day I do not usually call him because he has a lot of meetings so I normally wait a day. This time when I spoke with his mother she said, ‘No, he is not here’, so that was a big shock. “I first thought he might have had a heart attack on the plane. It was not a direct flight but there was a transit in Istanbul, so I rang the airport in Istanbul and asked if he could be in a hospital. The airport said they had no such information. All I knew was that he had been onboard the flight from Vienna. It was a Sunday and all the travel agencies were closed so I drove to the airport, and said I have to know whether he was on the flight from Istanbul or Tehran or not. They said they would not give information to a third party, and I was screaming and shouting. I was not myself. “Next I thought a taxi driver had attacked him for his money – all kinds of things were in my mind, but I never ever had the thought that he had been arrested by the government. The next day his brother went to Tehran airport and he was told he had been arrested and taken from there. We did not know who had arrested him, or for what reason. One and a half months after his arrest, the IRGC [the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of the Iranian armed forces] allowed him to call me, and he was allowed to say, ‘I am alive. Take care of yourself and the children.’ I asked him what had happened and – he was crying – he said he was not allowed to tell me.
“Three months later his mother received a call and was told she could visit him. That visit so affected her that she had to be driven to hospital with high blood pressure. He had lost 16 kilos and he told her under pressure he had signed two confessions.” Ghaderi finds it painful that her husband is still in jail, innocent, and cut off from his family, save a daily phone call, while the Austrian foreign ministry has hosted since April an Iranian government delegation in Vienna to discuss the future of the country’s nuclear deal. It is perhaps not a coincidence that French, German, British and US dual nationals are held by Iran, their countries being among the signatories to the stalled nuclear deal, but the detention of Ghaderi and another dual national Massud Mossaheb, the secretary of the Austro-Iranian Society, is a puzzle. Ghaderi explains: “I have come to realise this was a business for Iran, so my question to the Austrian ministry was ‘why him, what do they want in return for Kamran?’ It may not be something directly from Austria but from the EU.” Either way, the Austrian government has taken the softest of approaches to his plight, insisting quiet diplomacy is the best solution. In an open letter to the ministry in April, the two families begged to differ: “You do not publicly request their release, nor do you publicly acknowledge the injustice, torture and illegality of their imprisonment. After years of continuing to rely on ‘silent diplomacy’, we interpret this either as a sign of resignation, a lack of commitment or a lack of will to consider alternative strategies.” Looking through the public comments of the Austrian foreign ministry, it is hard to know that two of its citizens have been arbitrarily detained. The foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, has met Harika only once, when he was, she says, very kind, but meetings between the hostage families and the ministry are rare. The greatest irony is that Iran is mounting a campaign asking Iranian citizens abroad to return to their country to work. Perhaps, looking at Ghaderi’s family, few in the diaspora will be rushing for a flight back to Tehran.";https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/kamran-ghaderi-why-does-austria-stay-silent-dual-nationals-arrest-six-years-ago-iran
6175;6175;Spanish town comes together in hunt for ‘Galician Rambo’;2022-01-01T05:00:39Z;['Ashifa Kassam'];['Spain', 'Europe', 'World news'];Residents of a town in north-west Spain have banded together to try to track down a convicted murderer – nicknamed the “Galician Rambo” for his multiple jailbreaks and extensive knowledge of survival techniques – who is believed to be living in a nearby wooded area. Alfredo Sánchez Chacón has been on the run since March when he failed to return to prison after being allowed out on a day pass. News that the 63-year-old was missing probably surprised few: Sánchez Chacón, who is due to be in prison until 2025 for a murder in 1996, was already notorious across Spain for slipping out of prison twice. His first escape was in 1999 when he reportedly strung together a series of sheets to shimmy down the walls of the Pontevedra prison as other inmates distracted the guards. For more than two years he remained on the run, using his training as a former member of the Spanish Legion to hide out in the dense brush of northern Spain. In 2001 he managed to again break out of prison but his taste of freedom lasted just 25 minutes before he was caught, according to the newspaper La Voz de Galicia. This time around it was months before alarm bells began to sound in the small town of Pontedeume, in Galicia, about 65 miles (105km) from the prison. At the end of summer, the municipality’s 7,900 residents began trading stories of items that had mysteriously gone missing from their kitchens: packages of biscuits, cans of beer and cold cuts. Others had closer calls: one person recounted how he had stumbled across a man in his kitchen, peering into an open fridge, in the middle of the night. Suspicions that it could be Sánchez Chacón intensified last week after a hunter stumbled upon a man who matched the fugitive’s description living in a makeshift camp in the dense woods of the Fragas do Eume park near the town. Desperate residents soon came together, with eight of them announcing a patrol capable of combing the area for traces of Sánchez Chacón. “It’s outrageous that we’re caught in this,” one resident told La Voz de Galicia, while another hinted that this might not be the residents’ first brush with the Galician Rambo. “He was already hiding in the Fragas do Eume [park] more than 20 years ago, in another of his famous escapes.”;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/spanish-town-comes-together-in-hunt-for-galician-rambo

6177;6177;China opens embassy in Nicaragua for first time since 1990 after Taiwan ties cut;2022-01-01T02:49:49Z;['N/A'];['Nicaragua', 'China', 'Taiwan', 'Americas', 'Asia Pacific'];"China has opened an embassy in Nicaragua for the first time since 1990, less than a month after the central American country cut ties with Taiwan. The Nicaraguan foreign minister, Denis Moncada, said there was an “ideological affinity” between the two countries and thanked China for donating 1m doses of the Sinopharm coronavirus vaccine. Nicaragua’s president, Daniel Ortega, established relations with China in 1985, but after he lost the election in 1990, Nicaragua recognised Taiwan. Ortega returned to power in 2007 and in won re-election in November. In December, Nicaragua broke off relations with Taiwan and last week it seized the island’s former embassy and diplomatic offices, saying they belong to China. However, China’s new embassy is located elsewhere, and it is unclear what China will do with the Taiwan building.
Before departing a week ago, Taiwanese diplomats tried to donate the properties to the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Managua. But Ortega’s government said that any such donation would be invalid. Taiwan’s foreign relations ministry condemned the “gravely illegal actions of the Ortega regime”, saying the Nicaraguan government violated standard procedures by giving Taiwanese diplomats just two weeks to get out of the country. It said Taiwan “also condemns the arbitrary obstruction by the Nicaraguan government of the symbolic sale of its property to the Nicaraguan Catholic church”. Monsignor Carlos Avilés, the vicar of the archdiocese of Managua, told the newspaper La Prensa that a Taiwanese diplomat had offered the property to the church, but added: “I told him there was no problem, but the transfer was still in the legal process.” Nicaragua’s move to cut ties with Taiwan increased the island’s diplomatic isolation on the international stage. The most recent transfers of recognition from Taipei to Beijing were by Solomon Islands and Kiribati, in September 2019. El Salvador and the Dominican Republic switched in 2018, and Panama in 2017, after which it received waves of Chinese investment. Just 14 governments, primarily in the Pacific and Latin American regions, maintain formal ties with Taiwan. After Nicaragua, many eyes are now on Honduras and its newly elected president, Xiomara Castro.

6178;6178;Global economy to grow by about 4% in 2022, says thinktank;2022-01-01T00:05:33Z;['Julia Kollewe'];['Global economy', 'Inflation', 'Supply chain crisis', 'Stock markets', 'Economic growth (GDP)', 'Economics', 'Business'];"The year ahead will be dominated by efforts to fight inflation along with climate change, while global economic growth will be reasonably strong and stock markets weak, according to an economic forecaster. The world starts the year with economies held back by a supply chain crisis and the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, but the global economy is still expected to grow by about 4% in 2022, compared with an estimated 5.1% in 2021, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), a UK thinktank.
Douglas McWilliams, the founder and executive deputy chairman of the CEBR, said the group had been forecasting 6.7% growth for the UK in 2021 but reduced it to 6.6% after a weak December. “We estimate £3bn or so of lost GDP from people staying at home and not spending, plus the impact of the restrictions in Wales and Scotland.” Similarly, the 2021 forecast for global growth was cut by 0.1 percentage points to 5.1%. The new year will start slowly for the UK, but as supply issues get resolved and with unspent savings burning holes in people’s pockets, GDP is forecast to grow by at least 4% in 2022. The biggest issue facing policymakers around the world, especially in the US and the UK, is likely to be inflation, the thinktank said. The Bank of England unexpectedly lifted interest rates in December after a rise in inflation to a decade high of 5.1% and signalled that more rate rises will follow in 2022 as soaring energy costs are expected to push inflation to 6% in the spring. The US Federal Reserve has pencilled in three rate hikes next year and accelerated the rate at which it cuts spending on government bonds in the face of what one official called “alarmingly high inflation”. The CEBR said inflation could jump beyond 6% in the UK and to more than 7% in the US, where it reached a 39-year high of 6.8% in November.
While wages will also rise amid a tight labour market with declining unemployment and growing numbers of vacancies, soaring inflation will lead to a cost-of-living squeeze in the UK. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has warned that UK households are facing a “cost-of-living catastrophe” because of stalling wages, and rising tax and energy bills. In the face of higher interest rates and the rolling back of quantitative easing, global bond, equity and property markets are expected to fall around the world, with declines ranging from 10% to 25%, and some of the impact to last into 2023, the CEBR forecast. While 2021 was the year when environmental concerns went mainstream and the business sector took a more aggressive stance than governments, 2022 will be one “where policy has changed [and] pledges have been made but the technology is still in its early stages”, the CEBR said.";https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/01/global-economy-growth-forecast-2022-inflation
6179;6179;New year Brexit changes ‘permanently damage’ EU trade, says food body;2022-01-01T00:01:33Z;['Phillip Inman'];['Brexit', 'Food & drink industry', 'Economics', 'Business', 'UK news', 'Politics'];"Britain’s small businesses should expect trade with the EU to be “permanently damaged” from 1 January, the refrigerated supply chain trade body has said, after new customs checks take effect that it says will make imports from the bloc “more expensive, less flexible and much slower”. Amid growing public dismay at the negative impact of Brexit, the Cold Chain Federation said speciality food imports could face the same 70% decline that affected exports of food by small businesses this year after Britain quit the EU single market and customs union.
Extra costs that amount to £300 to £400 for each consignment will mean sales of food to EU countries in small batches could become uneconomic, said the CCF, which lobbies on behalf of firms that transport frozen and chilled goods. “The big casualty of these trade barriers is the business that needs to import small and frequent quantities across borders – a pallet load of speciality cheeses or boxes of onion powder. This is the sort of trade that is going to suffer,” said Shane Brennan, the federation’s chief executive. Business groups have called on the government to soften its stance in negotiations with the EU to prevent a collapse in trade with the 27-member bloc. But while ministers have agreed to extend the deadline for veterinary checks on food crossing the border, there has been little progress on cutting red tape. Mike Cherry, the chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said a survey in the autumn showed only a quarter of firms were prepared for the introduction of full import checks. “We don’t have any indication that the level of preparedness has improved, especially as the festive trading season has been so disrupted yet again,” he said, adding that one in five small firms that do business internationally had given up selling to clients in the EU since the transition period on exports ended.
Rising food prices have played a large part in the increase in inflation over the past six months, and economists fear higher import charges will push up prices further, forcing the Bank of England to increase interest rates at a faster pace than anticipated. The consumer prices index reached 5.2% in November and is expected to rise above 6% in the spring as higher food import costs and an increase in gas prices push up the cost of living. This week Simon Spurrell, a co-founder of the Cheshire Cheese Company, said the hard Brexit pushed through by Boris Johnson was the “biggest disaster that any government has ever negotiated in the history of trade negotiations”. Cheese makers are among the sub-sectors of the food and drink industry to be hardest hit by new trade barriers. UK food and drink exports to the EU fell by 24% in the first nine months of 2021, according to figures from the Food and Drink Federation, which said the slump helped knock the sector’s exports by £2.7bn between January and September compared with pre-pandemic levels. Brennan said exports that occupy only a fraction of a container had suffered the most from extra customs checks on exports, and that was likely to be repeated when checks also apply to imports. He said importers would need to satisfy safety rules, provide customer declarations and have the necessary paperwork to ensure goods move through ports. “And all these must be synchronised to prevent things being even slower,” he said. Cherry said: “Unless the government steps in with more support, the situation is set to worsen.” The Institute of Directors said its economic confidence index had tumbled from -6 in November to -17 this month, a sign of nervousness among business owners about the UK’s economic prospects.
It said three-quarters of company directors expected costs to rise in the next 12 months, and most said they would raise prices to either fully or partially offset the rise in costs. The Trades Union Congress said new checks on goods coming into the UK would damage the UK’s position as an important trading nation and the drive to create high-paying employment. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “With goods coming into the UK facing new paperwork, we could see further supply chain chaos, potentially hitting jobs in affected sectors. Government must invest in the infrastructure and jobs we need now to prevent further disruption.”";https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/01/new-year-brexit-changes-permanently-damage-eu-trade-says-food-body
6180;6180;Talking Horses: our tipping contest triumph and New Year’s Day pointers;2022-01-01T00:00:33Z;['Guardian sport', 'Greg Wood'];['Horse racing', 'Horse racing tips', 'Sport'];"The Guardian’s racing correspondent, Greg Wood, was the UK’s leading newspaper tipster in 2021, finishing several lengths clear of the opposition in the Racing Post’s annual National Press Challenge in his first year as our lead tipster. Wood went to the top of the table in June and maintained a clear lead for the second half of the year, in a contest based on the total return to a notional £1 stake at starting price on all selections. The Guardian’s picks over the course of 2021 had the highest strike-rate of any tipster at 27.6%, and showed a return of just under 92% on turnover, nearly 2% higher than the runner-up. In addition to individual winners at prices up to 28-1 during 2021, Wood’s selections at Royal Ascot in June showed a profit of £53.10 to a £1 level stake, including Perotto (Britannia Handicap) at 18-1, Lola Showgirl (Kensington Palace Stakes) at 12-1, two more winners at 10-1 and Subjectivist (13-2) in the Gold Cup, the feature event of the meeting. Other big-race winners included Commanche Falls (10-1) in the Stewards’ Cup at Goodwood in July and Midnight Shadow (9-1) in the Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham in November. Guardian sport Greg’s TV tips for Saturday Cheltenham is preparing to welcome as many as 30,000 racegoers to its traditional New Year’s Day card and many will look no further than the course specialist Coole Cody when it comes to the feature race, a handicap chase over two-and-a-half miles. The two courses at Cheltenham come alike to Evan Williams’s 11-year-old, whose three wins at this track include the Paddy Power Gold Cup in November 2020 and the valuable handicap at the December meeting three weeks ago. That form looks like the strongest on offer, but a 4lb higher mark makes life more difficult for Coole Cody and while his bold, front-running style makes him tough to pass, Zanza (2.00), who was two lengths behind him in second last time, could be worth an interest to turn the tables. That was Zanza’s second big run at Cheltenham in a row after finishing sixth in the Paddy Power, he is 2lb better off with the winner here and also runs in cheekpieces for the first time. That is another positive given that he comes from a yard which shows a level-stakes profit from more than 100 runners in first-time cheekpieces over the last 10 years.
Cheltenham 1.25: L’Homme Presse has made a flawless start to his chasing career and still had plenty left in the tank when he finished 13 lengths clear at Ascot last time. This is a significant step up in grade but he has only six starts to his name in all and should bridge the gap with something to spare. Musselburgh 1.40: Stoner’s Choice remains on a fair mark based on his win at Kempton in November and the drop back in trip here should also be in his favour. Musselburgh 2.10: First Impression unseated his rider before halfway over track and trip last time but has a big chance on his winning form at Wetherby in November. Tramore 2.20: The dual Gold Cup winner Al Boum Photo has had his Festival warm-up in this race for the last three seasons and should make it four in a row with a minimum of fuss. Cheltenham 2.35: It takes a fair leap of faith to back Spiritofthegames here, even at around 16-1, as his 18-race losing streak stretches back to November 2018. He rarely runs a bad race at this track, however, reverts to hurdling off a competitive mark and should get the strong pace he needs to show his best.
Musselburgh 2.50: A small field but all five runners have a fair chance on their best form. Amour De Nuit is back below his last winning mark over fences and looks like the safest option. Cheltenham 3.10: A fascinating renewal of the Relkeel Hurdle, with McFabulous marginally preferred to likely favourite Brewin’upastorm as he returns to action after a wind op. He has gone well fresh in the past and anything close to his winning form when this race was switched to Kempton last year could well be sufficient.";https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/01/talking-horses-tipster-triumph-cheltenham-saturday-tips
