0;Ambulance workers to stage 10 further strikes as row over pay and staffing escalates;Friday 20 January 2023 09:22, UK;[];['nhs', 'strikes'];['20', 'workers', 'staffing', 'row', 'nhs', 'members', 'escalates', 'ambulance', 'stage', 'pay', 'life', 'limb', 'dispute', 'striking', 'strikes'];"A series of fresh walkouts by ambulance workers has been announced by Unite in an escalation of the bitter dispute over pay and staffing.

The union said its members across England, Wales and Northern Ireland will stage 10 further strikes over the coming weeks, warning that additional dates could be announced soon.

Unite's ambulance workers are already set to walk out next Monday as the bitter row with the government remains deadlocked.

Unite gave details of when its members - employed by different ambulance trusts - will be striking:

• West Midlands: 6 and 17 February and 6 and 20 March

• North East: 6 and 20 February and 6 and 20 March

• East Midlands: 6 and 20 February and 6 and 20 March

• Wales: 6 and 20 February and 6 and 20 March

• North West: 6 and 22 February and 6 March and March 20

• Northern Ireland: 26 January and 16, 17, 23 and 24 February

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""Rather than act to protect the NHS and negotiate an end to the dispute, the government has disgracefully chosen to demonise ambulance workers.

""Ministers are deliberately misleading the public about the life and limb cover and who is to blame for excessive deaths.

""Our members faithfully provide life and limb cover on strike days and it's not the unions who are not providing minimum service levels.

""It's this government's disastrous handling of the NHS that has brought it to breaking point, and as crisis piles on crisis, the prime minister is seen to be washing his hands of the dispute. What a disgrace. What an abdication of leadership.""

Unite said representatives will be working at regional levels to agree derogations to ensure emergency life and limb cover stays in place during the walkout.

Other exemptions will ensure that patients needing lifesaving treatment, such as renal care and cancer treatment, will be transported to their appointments, said the union.

Unite official Onay Kasab said: ""The resolution to this dispute is in the government's hands. This dispute will only be resolved when it enters into proper negotiations about the current pay dispute.

""The government's constant attempts to kick the can down the road and its talk about one off payments, or slightly increased pay awards in the future, is simply not good enough to resolve this dispute.""

The amphibian, which weighs 2.7kg, shocked rangers who stumbled across it at the Conway National Park in North Queensland.

Queensland Department of Environment and Science said rangers were clearing a trail when they spotted the toad.

Ranger Kylee Gray said her team were ""blown away"" by the ""monster"" cane toad which weighed 2.7kg and is believed to be female.

She told the Australian Broadcasting Corp it was by far the largest toad she had encountered and said it looked ""almost like a football with legs"".

""We weighed it when we got back to base late that afternoon and we got her at 2.7 kilos which just shocked us, absolutely blew us away,"" she said.

""We measured her, we got I think 255mm, but I believe the Queensland Museum will be doing their measurements when they receive her.""

The Guinness World Record for the largest toad in history is 2.65kg - set by a pet toad in Sweden in 1991.

Ms Gray said rangers had dubbed the toad ""Toadzilla"", adding that the museum would be checking if it might be the largest toad found.

Cane toads are native to South America and Central America and were introduced to Australia in 1935, according to the WWF.

The toads mainly eat living insects, but will consume anything they swallow including pet food and household scraps.

Economists had forecast a 0.5% rise in December.

It follows a drop of 04% in November.

ONS deputy director for surveys and economic indicators, Heather Bovill, said: ""Retail sales dropped again in December, with feedback suggesting consumers cut back on their Christmas shopping due to affordability concerns.

""After last month's boost as shoppers stocked up early, food sales fell back again in December with supermarkets reporting this was due to increased food prices and the rising cost of living.""

The latest data comes as consumer confidence dipped again to a near-historic low in the face of inflation woes and growing concern about another hike in energy bills.

GfK's long-running Consumer Confidence Index fell three points in January to minus 45 after a short-lived and weak rally in the last quarter.

Inflation is likely to ""fall quite rapidly"" this year, according to Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey.

The governor told Business Live that a slight reduction in inflation rates last month showed ""the beginning of a sign that a corner has been turned"".

Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation fell from 10.7% in November to 10.5% in December.

Mr Bailey said: ""What we think is the most likely outcome is that (inflation) will fall quite rapidly this year, probably starting in the late spring and that has a lot to do with energy pricing.

""There was a sort of locked-in level of energy prices over the winter, but we expect it to fall quite rapidly after that, for at least for a couple of reasons.

""One, it is a bit of arithmetic in the sense as it is of course an annual calculation so the big base effects from last year will start to fall out, and unless something happens it will start to fall quite rapidly actually as we showed in our November monetary policy report.

The first three episodes of Harry & Meghan were released on 8 December, followed by the final three a week later, in the lead-up to the publication of the duke's controversial memoir Spare.

Reporting its fourth-quarter earnings, Netflix revealed it had gained 7.7 million subscribers during the October-December period, which included the debut of an ad-supported option for $7 (£5.65) per month.

Both Buckingham and Kensington Palace have remained silent over the allegations in the documentary series, which included Harry saying that the Prince of Wales left him terrified after screaming and shouting at him during the Sandringham summit.

The duke, 38, claimed that Kensington Palace ""lied to protect my brother"" when it issued a statement denying a story William had bullied him out of the Royal Family.

He also accused his father, King Charles, of lying at the tense Megxit crisis meeting with the Queen in January 2020.

Harry's autobiographical book Spare had no shortage of explosive revelations either, which became the fastest-selling non-fiction book in the UK since records began in 1998 after its release on 10 January.

The duke has used the 550-plus pages of Spare to make headline-dominating claims including accusing William of physically attacking him and teasing him about his panic attacks, saying King Charles put his own interests above Harry's and, in a US broadcast interview, branding Camilla as the ""villain"" and ""dangerous"".

In the book, he admits for the first time that he has taken cocaine, smoked weed and tried magic mushrooms, and claims to have killed 25 people in Afghanistan during his two tours of duty.

In his first interview since her death, Tim Edwards spoke of how his ""beautiful and caring"" daughter ""with a heart of gold"" will never leave him - as he reminded people of the impact gun violence has had on his family.

Paying tribute to the 26-year-old beautician and dental nurse, Mr Edwards told Sky News: ""She's the type of person that would walk into the room and everyone would gravitate towards her because she was always smiling.

""She was beautiful looking and she was a great hugger. She was just a fantastic human being with a heart of gold.""

In an emotional interview ahead of her funeral next week, Mr Edwards spoke of the devastation the family felt on Christmas Eve when they found out she had been killed and the ""struggle"" of the last month.

""Time moves so quick,"" he said.

""In our situation with the developments, Christmas Day didn't mean anything, that had gone. It didn't feel real and Christmas will never be the same. Christmas will never be a point of celebration for me, ever.""

Mr Edwards said Elle remained ""the glue that keeps us all together"" and that her death should not be in vain.

Elle was shot while celebrating with friends at the Lighthouse pub in Wallasey Village, Wirral, shortly before midnight on 24 December.

Elle's killing was the fifth shooting in Merseyside since August 2022 and Mr Edwards is hoping a foundation in her name will bring systemic change around gun violence.

""There's no winners with gun crime,"" he said.

""If you pick up a gun, your future is over and everybody else's future around you is over. It's dead simple. It's absolutely pointless and it solves nothing.

""I want to see a positive that comes out of this. Elle's name will be used for good in the future. She can't be forgotten,"" he added.

Labour has written to the government department arguing the ""public requires answers"" over the Tory chairman's tax affairs.

Questions have swirled following an article in The Sun on Sunday, which claimed a seven-figure payment was made by Mr Zahawi to end a dispute with the taxman ""after scrutiny of his family's financial affairs"".

Politics live: Teachers' unions and government meeting as thousands set to walk out on strike next month

The paper alleged there were questions over his use of an offshore company - a Gibraltar-registered family trust called Balshore Investments - to hold shares in the polling firm YouGov.

Mr Zahawi has previously denied he was a beneficiary of Balshore Investments.

Sky News has made a number of approaches to the Tory MP and his team to clarify the situation around the payment to HMRC, but he has still not revealed if the report is accurate.

Instead, we received a broader comment from the MP's spokesperson, who said his tax affairs ""were and are fully up to date and are paid in the UK"", adding: ""He has always said that he will answer any questions from HMRC as he always has done.""

Labour has already suggested that an inquiry might be required to look into the matter and the party has now submitted a series of questions to HMRC seeking clarity over the allegations.

HMRC has said it does not comment on individual cases, but Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said ""given the public interest in this case as well as the serious questions raised about a potential conflict of interest at the heart of government, the public requires answers"".

""In particular, there appears to be an element of special treatment directed towards Nadhim Zahawi by HMRC,"" she claimed.

Ms Rayner called on HMRC to explain the nature of the payment and whether the former chancellor ""has admitted fault or incurred financial penalties as part of his settlement"".

A spokesman for Mr Zahawi has said his taxes are ""properly declared"" and he ""has never had to instruct any lawyers to deal with HMRC on his behalf"".

""As he has previously stated, Mr Zahawi's taxes are properly declared and paid in the UK,"" the spokesman said.

Rishi Sunak defended his colleague at Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) on Wednesday, saying Mr Zahawi ""has already addressed this matter in full and there's nothing more that I can add"".

But Ms Rayner said: ""However much the prime minister claims the man he appointed Conservative Party Chair has already addressed this matter in full, there are serious and urgent questions that must be answered.""

Before entering politics, Mr Zahawi co-founded YouGov and is thought to have a net worth of around £100m.

Questions over his tax affairs have been raised before - namely ahead of his short tenure as chancellor in the closing days of Boris Johnson's premiership.

The Observer claimed civil servants in the Cabinet Office's propriety and ethics team alerted the prime minister to an HMRC ""flag"" over Mr Zahawi before his appointment, but Mr Johnson went ahead ""despite the possible concerns over his tax affairs"".

The minister claimed he was ""clearly being smeared"" in his campaign to become Conservative Party leader, telling Sky News he had ""always"" paid his taxes and had ""declared"" them in the UK.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120101811/http://news.sky.com/story/nadhim-zahawi-labour-writes-to-hmrc-over-former-chancellors-tax-dispute-claims-12790822

""It's an incredibly important decision and the team is very, very focused.""

Ms Ardern has received widespread praise from leaders around the world after announcing she would be stepping down but has faced mounting political pressures at home in recent months.

Nevertheless, Ms Ardern's announcement that 7 February would be her last day as prime minister after five and a half years in office came as a shock to the nation of five million people own.

Asked if misogyny played a role in her decision to leave, Ms Ardern said: ""No, it did not, and my strong message to women in leadership, and girls who may be considering leadership in the future is: This is a place where foundations have been laid long before me to make it possible for us to be in these roles in a way that in the past it just wasn't in the same way.

Speaking alongside other activists at Davos in Switzerland, Ms Thunberg, 20, said the elite are ""at the core of the climate crisis"" and are fuelling the destruction of the planet.

Ms Thunberg's comments follow her brief detention at an eco protest in Germany against the demolition of a village to expand a nearby coal mine on Tuesday.

She said: ""We are right now in Davos where basically the people who are mostly fuelling the destruction of the planet, the people who are at the very core of the climate crisis, the people who are investing in fossil fuels. Yet somehow these are the people that we seem to rely on solving our problems.

""They have proven time and time again that they are not prioritising that. They are prioritising self-greed, corporate greed and short-term economic profits above people and above planet.""

She was joined by other activists who brought a joint letter signed by nearly 900,000 people calling on fossil fuel company bosses to stop all new oil and gas projects.

Protests have been staged at the forum by dozens of climate activists. Some with clown makeup waved banners and chanted slogans at the end of the Davos Promenade on Sunday.

While the forum has discussed the need to address climate change among other topics, it has faced criticism for being a talking shop that results in little direct action.

Ms Thunberg said the change needed is not very likely to come from inside Davos, but from the ""bottom-up"" and public pressure from the outside.

America's dollar store is now the fastest-growing food retailer in the United States as the country grapples with its own cost of living crisis.

A study by researchers at Tufts University School of Medicine and the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy found the discount store has doubled their share in rural areas while households who purchase more tend to be lower-income and headed by people from ethnically diverse backgrounds.

Food and beverages stocked by dollar stores are typically lower in nutrients and higher in calories, while only a small percentage of such shops carry fresh produce and meats.

Their growing footprint, especially in the remote South, is also important as these regions already have higher baseline levels of obesity and food insecurity.

""Dollar stores play an increasingly important role in household food purchases, yet research on them is lacking.

In general, as people’s income goes up, they spend less of their budget at dollar stores, Tufts researchers found.

But they also found that in rural and low-income areas, people spend on average more than five percent of their food budget at dollar stores.

In particular, rural non-Hispanic Black households spend 11.6% of their food budgets in dollar stores. Households in the rural South also spend in large numbers.

""Many localities have established policies such as zoning laws aiming to slow dollar store expansion even though we don’t fully understand the role that they play,"" said researcher says Wenhui Feng.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120101811/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-inflation-likely-to-fall-quite-rapidly-in-spring-retailers-struggled-over-christmas-as-shoppers-cut-back-on-spending-12615118

Jade Samuels claimed her daughter was barred from the areas at Bishop Challoner Catholic College due to her braided hairstyle which featured a heart shape.

In a viral tweet which has more than 11 million views, Ms Samuel's wrote: ""My child is banned from the school playground/canteen for her hair, it's neatly braided in a natural colour, I gave them a lesson on the history of black women's hairs cultural significance of braiding, they chose violence, @BishopChalloner has a racist hair policy!!!"".

Ms Samuels said the school had an issue with the heart braided into her hair and claimed that her daughter had to sit on a table away from a friend in the canteen with other students who are not within the uniform policy.

The school's uniform policy states that students should not have ""shaved/razored hair styles or lines/patterns shaved into the hair"" and a final decision on whether a style or cut is appropriate is ""at the discretion of senior staff"".

In a statement, a spokesperson for the school said: ""Bishop Challoner Catholic College is very clear that braids are allowed to be worn in school. If parents/carers have any issues, there are clear procedures in place which they can follow for their concerns to be addressed.

""The decision has been made that if shaved patterns are not permitted for students, then a braided pattern cannot be permitted on that basis.""

They added that the school follows standard procedure with students sitting apart in the canteen during break and lunch times until the uniform code is applied and are permitted to sit with friends at staff discretion.

The New Zealand leader revealed she was resigning from the role on Thursday telling reporters she had ""nothing left in the tank"".

Ms Ardern said: ""I'll have to admit I slept well for the first time in a long time last night. But yes... still a range of emotions. So of course I feel, you know sad, but also I do have sense of relief.

""I actually feel deeply humbled by the response that I've received. To have those messages of gratitude has been really moving for me and for my family.

""It's an incredibly important decision and the team is very, very focused.""

And some political allies in New Zealand have suggested she took the decision to leave due to the level of abuse she received during her time in power.

Former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said she felt ""deep sadness"" on learning of the resignation.

""The pressures on Prime Ministers are always great, but in this era of social media, clickbait, and 24/7 media cycles, Jacinda has faced a level of hatred and vitriol which in my experience is unprecedented in our country,"" she said.

""Her whanau [family] have withstood the ugliest attacks over the last two years with what we believe to be the most demeaning form of politics we have ever seen.""

Ms Ardern has received widespread praise from leaders around the world after announcing she would be stepping down but has faced mounting political pressures at home in recent months.

Her Labour party has been struggling in the polls, with a Taxpayers Union-Curia poll released on Friday using data before Ms Ardern stepped down saw the party's popularity fall to 31.7%, down from 1.4% last month, with the opposition New Zealand National Party on 37.2%.

Nevertheless, Ms Ardern's announcement that 7 February would be her last day as prime minister after five and a half years in office came as a shock to the nation of five million people own.

Asked if misogyny played a role in her decision to leave, Ms Ardern said: ""No, it did not, and my strong message to women in leadership, and girls who may be considering leadership in the future is: This is a place where foundations have been laid long before me to make it possible for us to be in these roles in a way that in the past it just wasn't in the same way.

Video obtained by Reuters appeared to show Santos in drag at a gay pride parade in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro in 2005.

A performer who goes by the stage name Eula Rochard told the news agency she became friends with Santos at the parade - and that he performed in a drag show three years later.

Another person claimed he had aspired to become Miss Gay Rio de Janeiro.

Santos described the claims as ""categorically false"", adding: ""I will not be distracted nor fazed by this.""

He is the first non-incumbent openly gay party member elected to the House of Representatives.

And Santos was yesterday appointed to a pair of powerful committee positions by newly elected Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

But the New York representative has come under fire over a series of scandals.

He has admitted he did not graduate from college or work at two major Wall Street firms listed on his CV.

Santos claimed his mother was inside the World Trade Center during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but records obtained by NBC News suggest she was living in Brazil at the time. His campaign website said his mother died a few years after the attacks; she died in 2016, according to US media reports.

He has also faced claims of dishonesty over his account of his Jewish descent and claims he stole $3,000 from a fundraiser to save a veteran's dying dog.

Santos was accused of hypocrisy after prominently backing the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, which outlaws classroom discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity and has been labelled the ""don't say gay"" bill.

The South American country has seen its worst political violence for more than two decades, with 55 people killed in unrest since the country's first president from a rural Andean background was removed from office last month.

The protests have highlighted the deep divisions between the country's urban elite, largely concentrated in the capital Lima, and the mostly indigenous south.

Image: A person holds a sign reading ""Close the Congress""

Police estimated around 3,500 people attended the march, but others speculated the crowd was twice as large.

Some threw rocks at the police, who fired volleys of tear gas in response, and a major fire broke out at a building near the historic Plaza San Martin. The building was empty when the massive blaze ignited from unknown causes, a firefighter commander told local radio.

Peru's ombudsman said at least 13 civilians and four police officers were injured in Lima on Thursday, while 22 police officers and 16 civilians were injured throughout the country, Interior Minister Vicente Romero Fernandez said.

""This has not been a protest; this has been a sabotage of the rule of law,"" Prime Minister Alberto Otarola said alongside President Boluarte and other government ministers.

Ms Boularte criticised the protesters for ""not having any kind of social agenda that the country needs"" and accused them of ""wanting to break the rule of law"".

Former president Pedro Castillo has been in detention and is expected to be tried for rebellion since he was impeached after a failed attempt to dissolve Congress.

Last week Ms Boluarte's government extended a state of emergency in Lima and the southern regions of Puno and Cusco, which curtails some civil rights.

She has asked for ""forgiveness"" for the deaths of the protesters but has dismissed calls to resign.

The high street lenders said the sites, all but one of which are in England, will shut their doors between April and June.

It brings the total number of branch closures that have been announced so far this year to 64.

Earlier this month TSB said it would be shutting nine sites, while Barclays has earmarked 15 for the chop.

Banks have been reducing their branch networks across the country as increasing numbers of people use online banking leading to a decline in the use of over-the-counter services.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to lockdowns and social distancing measures, this trend accelerated.

But it has fuelled concerns about the impact on a significant minority for whom cash remains vital as well as small businesses that continue to rely on in-person facilities.

Lloyds Banking Group, which owns both banks, said the branches to be closed have seen the number of visits drop by about 60% on average in the last five years.

A spokesman said: ""Branches play an important part in our strategy but we need to have them in the right places, where they are well-used.

""We'll continue to invest in branches that are being used regularly, alongside our online, mobile app and telephone services.""

The Kremlin is intensifying its information operation to promote a false narrative that the war will escalate if Ukraine receives weapons capable of striking Russian forces in occupied Crimea, the Institute for the Study of War thinktank says.

It follows reports that US officials are considering providing Kyiv with such weapons.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said such a move would bring ”the conflict to a new qualitative level, which will not go well for global and pan-European security.”

He added that even the discussion of providing such weapons is ”potentially extremely dangerous,” but then noted that Ukraine already has weapons that it uses to strike occupied territories in Ukraine.



Crimea is internationally recognised as Ukrainian territory but has been occupied by Russian forces since 2014.

Turning to the issue of nuclear escalation, the ISW thinktank says the Kremlin is ""very unlikely"" to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and extraordinarily unlikely to use them against the West despite consistently leaning on threats.

Octopus has been named the best energy firm in an annual customer survey.

The survey of 10,197 members of the public in October and analysis by Which? gave Octopus a top combined score of 78%.

Octopus was the only provider to get a five-star rating in any category, which it received for the usefulness of its information about energy costs.

The firm took on an additional 1.5 million customers from Bulb in December, and Which? said it would be watching to see if it could maintain its performance.

Utilita was put in second place with a combined score of 67%.

Scottish Power was the worst-ranked firm in the watchdog's assessment of supplier practices with a score of 53%.

However, Shell Energy and SSE Energy Services were ranked worst by customers, with scores of 48% and 46% respectively.

Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: ""While customers are choosing to stay put due to a lack of deals in the energy market, our research has found that some firms are falling far short of meeting their customers' needs during the cost of living crisis.

The pair are being investigated over allegations of sexual assault and exploitation.

A judge has decided they must remain in prison for a further 30 days while police investigate.

The self-proclaimed misogynist was arrested in Bucharest on 29 December on charges of being part of an organised crime group, human trafficking and rape.

His brother Tristan and two Romanian women were also taken into custody. All deny the charges.

Ramona Bolla, a spokesperson from Romania's anti-organised crime agency DIICOT, said prosecutors requested the second 30-day extension on Thursday to keep all four in detention while investigations continue.

That request was granted on Friday, Bolla said.

32;Claire Foy: Stalker who targeted The Crown actress to be repatriated to US;Friday 20 January 2023 14:19, UK;['david mercer', '@davidmercersky'];['claire foy', 'the crown'];['repatriated', 'foy', 'targeted', 'actress', 'penrose', 'court', 'claire', 'judge', 'order', 'sending', 'crown', 'stalking', 'stalker', 'told', 'sent'];"A ""delusional"" stalker who targeted actress Claire Foy in a ""deeply frightening"" campaign against her is to be repatriated to the US.

Jason Penrose became the subject of a stalking protection order (SPO) last year after sending The Crown star thousands of emails and turning up at her door.

The American citizen pleaded guilty to stalking Foy - who played Queen Elizabeth II in the first two series of the Netflix show - between August 2021 and February 2022.

Image: Jason Penrose appeared at the Old Bailey

He also admitted two charges of breaching an interim stalking ban order by sending a letter and a parcel to the Golden Globe winner.

Foy, 38, found the actions of the 49-year-old stalker to be ""deeply frightening"", a court previously heard.

At a sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey on Friday, Penrose was spared jail and has agreed to be repatriated to the US.

He was sentenced to 22 months' imprisonment, suspended for two years.

Stalker 'infatuated' with Foy

Judge David Aaronberg said he remains ""troubled"" that Penrose, a paranoid schizophrenic, may continue to be ""infatuated"" with Foy, despite having been repeatedly told she wants no contact from him.

The conditions of the suspended sentence include that Penrose must remain under the care of a psychiatrist in the UK until his repatriation, and that he must co-operate fully with his return to the US.

The court heard that he will return to Florida to live with his mother and receive further psychiatric care.

Judge Aaronberg also imposed a restraining order banning him from contacting or attempting to contact Foy directly or indirectly, and from sending any letters, gifts, parcels or packages to her.

Penrose is also barred from entering the London boroughs of Camden and Islington, apart from to collect his US passport, and prohibited from going within 100 metres of any premises at which he knows Foy might be present.

The judge said Foy has ""become scared and suspicious of post she does not recognise and of her front doorbell ringing"" in the wake of the stalking.

""She told the police she was frightened to leave her property in case you might follow her,"" the judge added.

Foy 'fearful' after stalker's actions

Quoting a statement from the actress, the judge said: ""I feel like the freedoms I enjoyed before Mr Penrose contacted me have now gone.

""I view the world in a much more fearful way.""

At the time the SPO was granted, District Judge Michael Oliver said the order was ""necessary"" because of the ""sustained and repeated conduct due to a delusional belief Mr Penrose had about Ms Foy"".

The court heard that Penrose sent an email to Foy's agent claiming he was a film director and producer and wanted her to appear in his next film.

Foy told her agent she did not know who he was, and from 2 November to mid-December, he sent more than 1,000 emails, contacted the star's sister and attended her address after finding out where it was.

Emails were also sent to Foy's publicist, Emma Jackson, writing about ""wanting her to be his girlfriend"", according to court papers.

Rang doorbell 'constantly'

On 17 December 2021, Foy called the police to report that Penrose was ""outside her residence ringing on her doorbell constantly"", the papers said.

Penrose was due to be sentenced at Wood Green Crown Court in December but the case was adjourned as further assurances were sought that Penrose, who is in the UK illegally, would be deported following sentencing.

Before December's hearing, the court had also received a letter written by someone with ""some sort of obsession"" with Foy, Judge David Aaronberg said.

Penrose, who has been held in hospital for mental health treatment, denied sending the letter and said from the dock: ""They've spelt my name wrong.""

Sky News has learnt that Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, has been advised by officials to approve a request from British Steel for public money following an intervention by Grant Shapps, the business secretary, and Michael Gove, the levelling-up secretary.

Whitehall sources said the government was expected to communicate a decision to the company in the coming days, which would see around £300m handed to it in instalments during the next few years.

The funding would be ""directly linked"" to a project to replace British Steel's blast furnaces at its Scunthorpe site with a greener electric arc furnace, according to one person close to the situation.

Jingye Group, British Steel's Chinese owner, would also be obliged to invest at least £1bn in the business by 2030 and make commitments relating to job retention, the person added.

If those conditions are not met, the Treasury could still decide not to proceed with the funding.

Sky News revealed last month that Mr Shapps and Mr Gove had written to the chancellor to seek approval for the package of financial support.

A decision to grant it will not be without controversy, given British Steel's Chinese ownership and doubts about its adherence to financial commitments made when it bought the business out of insolvency proceedings in 2020.

In their December letter to the chancellor, his cabinet colleagues warned that British Steel's demise could cost the government up to £1bn in decommissioning and other liabilities.

They cautioned Mr Hunt that British Steel ""does not have a viable business without government support"".

""Closing one blast furnace would be a stepping-stone to closure of the second blast furnace, resulting in a highly unstable business model dependent on Chinese steel imports,"" Mr Shapps and Mr Gove wrote.

""Given the magnitude of the liabilities due to fall on HMG in the event of blast furnace closure, and following the PM's steer, we would like officials to test whether net Government support in the region of £300m for British Steel could prevent closure, protect jobs and create a cleaner viable long-term future for steel production in the United Kingdom.""

They also argued that retaining sovereignty over steel production was critical to the UK economy.

""Every other G20 nation has maintained domestic steel production and, while we do not think that this should come at any cost, we do believe it is in HMG's interest to offer well-designed and targeted funding which unlocks private investment, achieves a good outcome for taxpayers, and enables transformed, decarbonised and viable domestic steel production to continue in the UK in the long-term,"" Mr Shapps and Mr Gove wrote.

""We do not want to become reliant on steel sources elsewhere in the same way that energy security has become self-evidently important.

The fate of British Steel, which was bought by Jingye out of an insolvency process just under three years ago, has become increasingly unclear in recent months as the current owners have indicated that they would not maintain its operations without taxpayer funding.

British Steel employs about 4,000 people, with thousands more jobs in its supply chain dependent upon the company.

Jobs threat

According to last month's letter, British Steel had already informed the government that it could close one of the Scunthorpe blast furnaces as soon as next month, with the loss of 1,700 jobs.

This would be ""followed by the second blast furnace closing later in 2023, creating cumulative direct job losses of around 3,000"", Mr Shapps and Mr Gove wrote.

Mr Shapps' predecessor, Jacob Rees-Mogg - who lasted just weeks as business secretary under Liz Truss - opened formal talks with Jingye in October about the provision of government funding to help British Steel decarbonise.

Image: The company employs about 4,000 people

One of the pre-conditions set by Whitehall for the discussions was that Jingye would not cut jobs at British Steel while the discussions were ongoing, although the recent letter to Mr Hunt said that ministers ""cannot guarantee the company will choose to support jobs in the short term"".

Tata Steel, which is the biggest player in the UK steel sector, has also requested financial help from the government in the past year.

The request for financial support from Jingye poses a political headache for ministers, given the scale of the potential job losses which might result from a refusal to provide taxpayer aid.

Subsidies contentious

An agreement to provide substantial taxpayer funding to a Chinese-owned business, however, would inevitably provoke outrage among Tory critics of Beijing.

Image: Tata Steel, which is the biggest player in the UK steel sector, has also asked for support

China's role in global steel production, after years of international trade rows about dumping, would make any subsidies even more contentious.

In May 2019, the Official Receiver was appointed to take control of the company after negotiations over an emergency £30m government loan fell apart.

British Steel had been formed in 2016 when India's Tata Steel sold the business for £1 to Greybull Capital, an investment firm.

As part of the deal that secured ownership of British Steel for Jingye, the Chinese group said it would invest £1.2bn in modernising the business during the following decade.

Jingye's purchase of the company, which completed in the spring of 2020, was hailed by Boris Johnson, the then prime minister, as assuring the future of steel production in Britain's industrial heartlands.

British Steel 'can play a significant role in the UK's economic recovery'

Responding to an enquiry from Sky News, a British Steel spokesman said: ""To support the journey to net zero, our owners, Jingye, have invested £330m in capital projects during their first 3 years of ownership and they continue to invest unprecedented sums of money in British Steel.

""Jingye are committed to our long-term future but we also require the UK government to provide the necessary support, policies and frameworks to back our drive to become a clean, green and sustainable company.

""We are continuing formal talks with the government about decarbonisation, along with the global challenges we currently face.

""The government understands the significant impact the economic slowdown, rising inflation and exceptionally high energy and carbon prices are having on businesses like ours, particularly during such a key period in our transformation.

""British Steel can play a significant role in the UK's economic recovery and we look forward to working with the government and to making the home-made steel Britain needs for generations to come.""

Seven years since his history-making stroll among the stars in January 2016, the 50-year-old will become an ambassador for the European Space Agency (ESA) to help young people pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and maths.

He has been an ESA astronaut since May 2009, and first visited the ISS in December 2015.

The ex-British army helicopter pilot hailed the experience of looking down on Earth during his six-month mission as ""an incredible feeling"".

He had hoped to return but has been on sabbatical since October 2019.

Major Peake said: ""I have had the privilege of working with an exceptional team of dedicated individuals during the past 13 years with the agency, which has been incredibly exciting and rewarding.

""By assuming the role of an ambassador for human spaceflight, I shall continue to support ESA and the UK Space Agency, with a focus on educational outreach, and I look forward to the many exciting opportunities ahead.""

Image: Major Peake during his first ISS spacewalk

Major Peake's role in space

The Briton went into space for a mission called Principia, which included more than 250 scientific experiments.

His spacewalk was to repair the space station's power supply.

Major Peake also broke records by completing a marathon in space in three hours, 35 minutes, and 21 seconds.

Since the Principia mission, which ended with Major Peake touching back down on Earth in a Soyuz spacecraft alongside astronauts from Russia and NASA, he has been an enthusiastic ambassador for space travel and the collaboration it fosters.

After Prince William's criticism of the space race and the involvement of billionaires, Major Peake told Sky News it remained ""incredibly important"" to explore the stars.

He has also been a de facto ambassador for the UK's efforts to expand its role in the new space race, hailing this month's orbital rocket launch from Cornwall as ""a ground-breaking mission for the UK space industry"".

Dr Paul Bate, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said he had ""played a leading role"" in the sector.

He added: ""Not only has he carried out important scientific work during his historic Principia mission to the ISS and while on Earth, but he has inspired millions with his passion for space and the opportunities it offers.""

Who will fly the flag for Britain next?

Three British citizens were announced as part of the ESA's next batch of astronaut candidates late last year.

They include Rosemary Coogan, an astrophysicist from Northern Ireland, who from April will undertake vigorous training for a future mission.

The move comes amid emerging concerns around the negative consequences of the single-use devices.

Zero Waste Scotland will undertake the review into the smoking alternatives, considering international responses.

Circular economy minister Lorna Slater said: ""Not only are single-use vapes bad for public health, they are also bad for the environment.

""From litter on our streets, to the risk of fires in waste facilities, there are issues which need to be addressed urgently.

""We will consider the evidence and expert advice and come forward with policy options, which could include a potential ban on single-use vapes.""

She added: ""In the meantime, we would urge everyone who uses these products to make sure they are disposed of properly.""

The Scottish government said other approaches could include increasing access to responsible disposal options, improved product design or public communications campaigns.

'Robust and objective review'

Dundee-based climate activist Laura Young, who has been dubbed the ""vape crusader"" due to her ongoing campaign against the devices, told Sky News she was ""thrilled"" with the Scottish government's response.

She added: ""I have full trust in a robust and objective review from Zero Waste Scotland into the environmental impacts, and look forward to hearing the full picture here in Scotland with regards to these products.

""This review, and consideration of a ban, cannot come quick enough, as the rise of these devices puts our environment, waste workers, recycling infrastructure, and public health particularly with a lens of young people, under tremendous pressure.""

Ms Young noted that with ""all things political"", any final decision would take time.

She added: ""Therefore it is vital that in the interim we continue to hold vaping companies to the extended producer responsibility regulations, and improve public awareness of how to dispose of these correctly through recycling.""

'Tackling our throwaway culture is a priority'

Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said ""any form of littering is unacceptable"".

He added: ""Single-use items, like disposable vapes, are becoming an all-too-common eyesore in areas where we live, work and socialise, and can last in our environment for years and years.

""Tackling our throwaway culture is a priority here at Zero Waste Scotland and we are happy to lead on this important review.""

Hundreds of wrestlers from across the country have joined protests in Delhi following the allegations, which have been levelled at Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, president of the Wrestling Federation of India.

Mr Singh, a six-time member of parliament for the ruling BJP party, has denied all allegations against him, branding them a conspiracy.

He said the athletes have no evidence to support their claims, and he is ready for any kind of investigation.

India's Sports Minister, Anurag Thakur, has met with some of the wrestlers and given the sport's governing body until Saturday to respond to the allegations.

The protesting wrestlers are demanding the resignation of Mr Singh and a complete restructuring of the federation.

The wrestlers have also appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Supreme Court of India to intervene.

Vinesh Phogat, the country's only double World Championship medallist, said she was not a victim herself, but claimed to know of at least five or six athletes who are, and said she has proof.

""If we do not get a satisfactory response, we will file a criminal complaint,"" she said.

She added: ""If Olympians are saying something wrong has happened, don't doubt us. I say with great shame that if girls like us go through sexual harassment then no woman is safe in India. I will say no girl should be born in India.

Jason Penrose became the subject of a stalking protection order (SPO) last year after sending The Crown star thousands of emails and turning up at her door.

The American citizen pleaded guilty in November to stalking Foy - who played Queen Elizabeth II in the first two series of the Netflix show - between August 2021 and February 2022.

He also admitted two charges of breaching an interim stalking ban order by sending a letter and a parcel to the Golden Globe winner.

Foy, 38, found the actions of the 49-year-old stalker to be ""deeply frightening"", a court previously heard.

Penrose was spared jail at the Old Bailey on Friday and has agreed to be repatriated to the US.

He was sentenced to 22 months' imprisonment, suspended for two years.

At the time the SPO was granted, District Judge Michael Oliver said the order was ""necessary"" because of the ""sustained and repeated conduct due to a delusional belief Mr Penrose had about Ms Foy"".

The court heard that Penrose sent an email to Foy's agent claiming he was a film director and producer and wanted her to appear in his next film.

Foy told her agent she did not know who he was, and from 2 November to mid-December, he sent more than 1,000 emails, contacted the star's sister and attended her address after finding out where it was.

Emails were also sent to Foy's publicist, Emma Jackson, writing about ""wanting her to be his girlfriend"", according to court papers.

On 17 December 2021, Foy called the police to report that Penrose was ""outside her residence ringing on her doorbell constantly"", the papers said.

Penrose was due to be sentenced at Wood Green Crown Court in December but the case was adjourned as further assurances were sought that Penrose, who is in the UK illegally, would be deported following sentencing.

Before December's hearing, the court had also received a letter written by someone with ""some sort of obsession"" with Foy, Judge David Aaronberg said.

Penrose, who has been held in hospital for mental health treatment, denied sending the letter and said from the dock: ""They've spelt my name wrong.""

The pair are being investigated over allegations of sexual assault and exploitation.

A a judge has decided they remain in prison for a further 30 days while police investigate.

The self-proclaimed misogynist was arrested in Bucharest on 29 December on charges of being part of an organised crime group, human trafficking and rape.

His brother Tristan and two Romanian women were also taken into custody. All deny the charges.

Last week authorities in Romania seized several luxury cars from his villa on the outskirts of the capital.

The 36-year-old British-US citizen has 4.4 million followers on Twitter and was previously banned from various prominent social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech.

Prosecutors have said the Tate brothers recruited their victims by seducing them and falsely claiming to want a relationship.

The former Big Brother contestant and kickboxer is believed to have lived in Romania since 2017.

Mr Sands, 65, was reported missing at around 7.30pm last Friday (13 January) after failing to return home from a hike on Mount Baldy in the San Gabriel Mountains in southern California.

In an update on Thursday, San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said: ""On 15 January, phone pings showed Sands to be heading to the Mount Baldy area.

""Additional phone pings from the cell provider were attempted but were unsuccessful, due to the lack of cell service and most likely cell phone power failure.

""A delayed ping through Sands' Apple iPhone operating system, from 14 January, provided a possible location on one of the trails leading to the summit of Mount Baldy.

""This area was checked by ground searchers and by helicopter. Ground and air searchers were unable to locate any evidence in this area that would assist in locating Mr Sands.""

The latest development comes as the sheriff's department said there is ""no hard deadline"" for calling off the search one week after Mr Sands was first reported missing.

They said the incident was still being classified as a search and rescue operation despite snow, sleet and fog frustrating operations.

""We will schedule another ground search when the weather improves, and it is safe for our ground crews,"" a spokesperson told PA news agency.

Earlier on Thursday, Mr Sands's car was discovered in a local car park and towed away by his family.

Residents on Mount Baldy said the conditions were ""extreme"".

""Even as a resident, we don't hike this time of year... it's sketchy, it can be very dangerous,"" Stephanie Coyne told PA.

""In prior years, other people have gone missing and (people) get injured every year.""

""People have been found, it can happen. I wouldn't rule anything out - the whole situation is just unfortunate,"" she said.

The sheriff's department previously urged hikers to ""think twice and heed warnings"" after the extreme weather conditions, saying its search and rescue teams had responded to 14 calls in the Mount Baldy area in the last four weeks.

Writing on change.org, amateur player Ed Bartlett said the move would make the sport ""a farcical spectacle to watch"", with yellow and red cards being ""handed out like confetti"" and a rise in ""head on knee contact"", which, he speculated, may ""cause more injury?"".

Ball carriers will be ""encouraged to follow the principle of evasion"" and to ""avoid late dipping"", the Rugby Football Union (RFU) said in a statement on Thursday, but the governing body has stopped short of banning two-man tackles.

Referees, it added, will be asked ""to focus on the actions of the ball carrier as well as the tackler when head contact occurs"".

The community game in England, meaning clubs, schools, colleges and universities at both age-grade and adult levels, including the National One division and below in the men's game and Championship One and below in the women's game, are affected by the move.

The change is ""designed to improve player safety"", ""reduce head impact exposure and concussion risk in the tackle for both the ball carrier and tackler,"" the RFU said.

RFU President Nigel Gillingham said: ""Players' welfare must always be at the centre of decisions we make about how we play the game of rugby.

""Evidence from our own research and from around the world clearly shows that lowering the tackle height will reduce head impact exposure and the risk of concussion.

The RFU Council, he added, ""unanimously supported the decision"", predicting that tacklers will use safe techniques ""taught from an early age"".

Former England player Brian Moore told The Daily Telegraph head injuries had fallen in France after tackling above the waist in amateur games was banned there.

But he also warned of the possibility of ""head collisions of two tacklers both tackling lower, and with heads contacting knees"" under the new rules.

Ex-Wales international Lee Jarvis posted a picture on Twitter from a match showing players of differing heights, suggesting that the taller player would no longer be able to tackle the shorter one.

Mark Ring, another former Wales international, lamented the decline in tackling standards generally.

Thelwell's solicitor, Nicola Hall, said the issues at trial would include whether his actions ""were part of legitimate protest"" and whether they ""looked likely to cause fear of unlawful violence"".

The letter says: ""We want to apologise for the ways in which the Church of England has treated LGBTQI+ people - both those who worship in our churches and those who do not.

""For the times we have rejected or excluded you, and those you love, we are deeply sorry. The occasions on which you have received a hostile and homophobic response in our churches are shameful and for this we repent.

The Silicon Valley giant employs more than 5,000 staff in both countries, but the company would not be drawn on how the mass redundancies would impact them.

The ""difficult news"" about the job losses - about 6% of the total workforce - was revealed by Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai on Friday in an email to employees that was also posted on the company's news blog.

He said the company had hired for ""periods of dramatic growth"" over the past two years, but that was a ""different economic reality than the one we face today"".

The cuts come days after rival Microsoft said it would axe 10,000 workers or nearly 5% of its workforce.

Facebook parent Meta is cutting 11,000 posts, while Amazon is slashing 18,000 jobs.

The way the war in Ukraine is going, tanks are likely to become hugely important.

Ukraine says a big Russian offensive is coming in the spring and could throw another half a million Russian soldiers into battle.

In ground wars involving big infantry offensives, the tank can make all the difference.

Didn't experts say this war had rendered the tank obsolete?



They did, but that was about the older kind of tanks that both Ukraine and Russia were using.

They had Soviet-made T tanks from the T 64 all the way up to the T 90, the number generally denoting the year the tank first came into service.

Western-supplied anti-tank weapons combined with Ukrainian spotters using drones have destroyed more than 1,500 of them on the Russian side.

Image: A captured Russian T-72 tank

Why are the Ukrainians asking the West for more tanks?

The Ukrainians have a lot of tanks, but they're also T tanks, mainly the T 64 and T 72, which are old and vulnerable to Russian attack.

To repel a springtime Russian offensive they need modern battle tanks which are far better protected, faster and more deadly.

And they also need them if they want to break through well dug-in Russian forces and reclaim land taken by the occupiers.

Sending Ukraine tanks weakens UK forces

Berlin asked for permission to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine

What are they asking for?

The best tank for Ukraine would be the German-made Leopard 2.

Tanks are rated on their ability to strike other targets and their resilience from attack.

The Leopard 2 moves fast, has state-of-the-art targeting and is well protected by armour.

It is also, crucially, operated by 14 European countries, so spare parts are widely available.

Don't they want the Challenger tanks the British are sending?

Yes, the Challenger is a highly capable tank but the UK can only spare around a dozen of them.

Ukraine wants 300 tanks. Experts say if it gets 100 that will be enough to make a difference.

Britain is mainly offering them as a catalyst to persuade the Germans and others to send their own battle tanks.

Image: A British Challenger 2 tank. File pic

Is that working?

Not yet. Germany has been reluctant to send the tanks but also to give permission to let other countries send them instead - which they need because Berlin holds the export licence.

Germany says that would change if the Americans send their Abrams tanks too.

Are Abrams tanks better?

It's like buying a second-hand car. Spares and servicing availability are important.

The Leopard's ubiquity in Europe gives it the edge in both departments.

The Abrams M1 also loses points on fuel consumption over its German rival and with fuel scarcity an issue that matters.

Image: An M1 Abrams tank. Pic: AP

Will the US send a few anyway to encourage the Germans to release the Leopards?

As things stand, no.

They seem to want Europeans to do more to support Ukraine.

They are also worried that sending the Abrams would mean Ukraine's main offensive capability is American supplied and that would up the ante in the war, playing into Russian propaganda claims this war is about fighting US aggression.

What if Ukraine does not get the tanks it wants?

Russia's wartime leader Joseph Stalin once said ""quantity has a quality all of its own"" and Russia is mobilising hundreds of thousands of troops, possibly preparing for a major offensive in the spring.

Ukraine's commanders say Western-supplied tanks will be crucial to repelling that threat, and many military experts agree.

But they need them soon if they are going to have enough time to train on them and use them effectively to see off the Russian menace.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120153234/http://news.sky.com/story/how-faster-deadlier-tanks-could-turn-the-tide-in-the-ukraine-war-12791057

The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said its chair, Martin Hewitt, wrote to all chief constables on Friday, asking them to take ""immediate action"" and complete the checks by 31 March.

The Home Office ordered the checks after former Metropolitan Police officer David Carrick was revealed to be one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders after he admitted 49 criminal charges, including 24 counts of rape.

Forces are expected to have identified all cases for further investigation by September - with inquiries to be prioritised based on the threat and risk identified.

The NPCC said the final stage of the process will be to develop a new automated platform to carry out continuous national police database checks.

Mr Hewitt said: ""The confidence of women and girls in the police has been damaged further by the horrific and abhorrent details revealed in the David Carrick case.

The 38-year-old telecoms engineer also thought the coronavirus vaccine would cause mass deaths, the breakdown of society and the imposition of a Chinese-style communist system.

Following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, Lewin was found guilty in December of preparing acts of terrorism.

He was sentenced on Friday to six-and-a-half years in prison.

Judge Paul Farrer said Lewin was ""socially isolated, depressed and lacking in self worth"" at the time of his offending.

""These features led you into telling many lies about the extent of your terrorist activities,"" the judge added.

""Your objective was to influence the government although in reality the prospects of you successfully doing so were remote in the extreme.""

Nick Price, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Lewin's beliefs were ""extremely dangerous"" and he ""planned to commit a terror attack on our nation's infrastructure by amassing a huge amount of equipment, and undertaking reconnaissance"".

""He not only was committed to the idea that violence was the only way to overthrow the government, but he also sought to persuade others to join him,"" Mr Price added.

Under the name, Crouching Hedgehog, he tried to recruit others to attack critical infrastructure in order to weaken the government, posting to the group: ""We are at war people, make no mistake. You have to treat it like one.""

Plotted attack on M1

Lewin claimed to be a former ""forward observer"" for the special forces but had actually been working for a company which maintained radio masts and was living at home with his mother.

He exaggerated his skills in order to persuade others that he would be a ""credible and effective leader of terrorist attacks"", prosecutor Annabel Darlow KC said.

Lewis began writing the ""Civilian Resistance Operations Manual"", designed to train others to join his campaign.

In the manual, Lewin stated that his ""ideal primary objective would be to topple the government and all within it"".

He wrote that he wanted to ""install a civilian-led alternative that doesn't act for themselves consider anybody below them mere scum"".

Lewin advised potential recruits to carry a machete as ""the very least"" and wrote about a ""core strategy"" involving ""severing major communications"".

The court heard he planned to target transmitter masts and transport infrastructure, such as the M1.

His targets included masts that carried traffic for the BBC, an emergency services radio network, as well as internet traffic, in-car navigation systems and security cameras.

Lewin joined The Resistance UK in July 2021 and was immediately put under surveillance - including by two undercover officers.

A month later, he was arrested by members of the West Midlands Counter-Terrorism Unit.

Following his arrest, police discovered tools including pipe tube cutters, cable shears and cable strippers, that he had bought before the COVID outbreak.

They also found army surplus equipment including a jacket, backpack, groundsheet, rifle sling, rifle scope and an airgun silencer to fit the three airguns he had.

'A bit of a loser'

In his bedroom was a notebook containing handwritten notes that included a target list of ""media, transport, infrastructure, power, comms, roads & rail"".

In court, Lewin said he had been pretending to be from the special forces but was actually ""a bit of a loser"".

Andrew Hall KC, defending, said Lewin was ""very odd"" and described him as ""opinionated, obsessive, without a sense of humour and lacking in any sense of self-worth"".

He had lost his job and moved back in with his mother, his relationships had failed and he had few, if any, friends.

However, Ms Darlow told the jury: ""The level of preparations and conduct far exceeded anything that might be commensurate with fantasy.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120160332/http://news.sky.com/story/covid-conspiracy-theorist-oliver-lewin-jailed-for-planning-terror-attack-to-topple-government-12790787
56;Accused rapist was 'struggling with sexuality' at time she allegedly assaulted woman;Friday 20 January 2023 15:57, UK;[];['glasgow', 'scotland'];['rapist', '2016', 'assaulted', 'daughter', 'sexuality', 'court', 'struggling', 'dont', 'woman', 'heard', 'accused', 'victim', 'bryson', 'alleged', 'told', 'mother', 'allegedly'];"A transgender woman accused of raping two women has said she was ""struggling with my sexuality and having issues emotionally"" at the time of the first alleged assault.

Isla Bryson, 31, said that both alleged victims consented to sex in the separate incidents and told the High Court in Glasgow: ""I would never hurt another human being.""

Bryson is accused of raping two women, one in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, in 2016, and one in Drumchapel, Glasgow, in 2019.

The court previously heard in agreed evidence that Bryson now identifies as a transgender woman and was previously known as Adam Graham.

Bryson, from Clydebank, said she knew she was transgender at the age of four but did not make the decision to transition until she was 29, and is taking hormones and seeking surgery to complete gender reassignment.

Giving evidence on Friday, she told the court that she was struggling with her sexuality when she met the first alleged victim in 2016.

She went to stay with the victim, whom she met online, after leaving a brief, unhappy marriage.

Edward Targowski KC, defending, asked whether she forced herself upon the woman on the evening of the alleged rape.

Bryson told the court: ""No, I did not, there was barely any sexual activity between us.""

Asked whether she raped the alleged victim, she said: ""No, I did not do that and I would never hurt another human being.""

Describing how she was feeling in 2016, Bryson told the court: ""At that time, I was struggling with my sexuality and having issues emotionally.

""I knew that I was gay, I'd slept with men under the radar but nobody knew.""

Commenting on where she is now with her transition, she said: ""I've got my top half"", referring to her breasts which she said were due to the hormones, and added: ""I want all the surgeries the NHS can give me, I want facial surgery, laser, gender.""

Bryson said she met the second alleged victim in 2019 via an app and went to meet her at the woman's house.

She told the court that they did have sex but said ""she consented to everything"".

Earlier, the court heard from the mother of the alleged 2016 victim, who said that she heard her daughter saying, ""no, don't do that, stop"" from behind her bedroom door on the night she was allegedly raped by Bryson.

She told the court that the accused was in a relationship with her daughter, who lived with her, and regularly stayed over.

She said: ""When I was going to the toilet I heard her saying, 'no, don't, don't do that', but I just put it down to being embarrassed. I went away to the living room.""

Asked by the prosecutor to clarify what she heard her daughter say, she said: ""No, don't do that, stop.""

Mr Keenan asked: ""Is that something you heard her say once or did you hear it more?""

She replied: ""She said it a couple of times.""

The mother said that in 2016 Bryson was bald with a tattoo on the face, below 5ft 5in in height and of quite stocky build.

Cross-examining Bryson, Mr Keenan asked whether she knew the mother was in the house at the time of the incident.

She replied: ""No, I didn't and if a mother heard her daughter saying 'no no no', she would've rushed in and not gone in the living room.""

Local residents have been posting pictures online of their efforts to warn other road users of the state of some streets.

The local authority, which is minority run by Scottish Labour, has since warned against moving the cones, saying only those with ""relevant training and authority"" should amend traffic management.

Wilma Harper took action after coming across a pothole around a drain in Queensferry Road, near to Drum Brae in the west of the city.

""I took a cone and stuck it in the hole,"" she said in a Tweet to the council. She added there were ""bits of debris"" on the pavement.

Ben Glasgow did the same on West Coates in the centre of the city.

He said: ""As a matter of urgency, you need to fix this road.

""Could easily kill a cyclist and damage many unsuspecting cars or even cause a head-on collision.""

Mr Glasgow shared a video of the cone in the hole.

Roadworks have now commenced to resurface West Coates, which is expected to take around six weeks to complete.

Scottish Conservative and Lothian MSP Miles Briggs told Sky News that covering up potholes with traffic cones was ""not a solution"" as he hit out at the state of the city's roads.

He said: ""Edinburgh has now become the pothole capital of Europe and the poor condition of the capital's road is an ongoing issue.

""Motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians are reporting more and more potholes and local roads in a worse condition than I can remember.

""Covering up potholes with traffic cones is not a solution and emphasises just how bad the roads in the capital have become.""

Mr Briggs said the Scottish Conservatives want a Pothole Action Fund to focus on repairing badly damaged roads.

'Road maintenance in Edinburgh is underfunded'

Scottish Labour councillor Scott Arthur, transport and environment convener, confirmed there had been an increase in enquiries due to the ""prolonged cold weather"" in mid to late December followed by torrential rain.

He added that ""additional resources"" were being diverted to cope with the problem.

In response to residents moving traffic cones into the potholes, he said: ""Only people with the relevant training and authority should amend traffic management, which otherwise could pose a risk to other road users and themselves.

""Emergency road and pavement defects should be reported to our contact centre or out of hours team, who will arrange for an inspection and repair as soon as possible.""

He added: ""I acknowledge that road maintenance in Edinburgh is underfunded, and I hope to work with other political parties to address this in the coming budget.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120160332/http://news.sky.com/story/edinburgh-branded-pothole-capital-of-europe-as-residents-move-traffic-cones-into-holes-12791168

Plans to legislate in this area have been delayed since 2015 when a government consultation found restaurant customers were overwhelmingly in favour of the tips they paid going to the people who served them.

Further research the same year found that many owners of restaurants, bars, and cafes add discretionary service charges to customers' bills but then keep some of the money themselves.

Under the Employment (Allocation of Tips) Bill, employers would have a legal obligation on employers to ensure all tips, gratuities and service charges are paid to workers in full.

Employees will be able to request tipping records and take employers to a tribunal if they feel tips have been withheld.

The long-delayed legislation would also enable the government to create a code of practice intended to ensure fairness and transparency in how the money is allocated among staff, and introduce an enforcement mechanism for employees to make complaints and seek redress.

In October 2018, then prime minister Theresa May announced plans to deal with tips but Brexit turmoil prevented the legislation from going ahead.

Similarly Boris Johnson, when he was in the top job, also looked to make the change when in October 2019 the Queen's Speech committed to bringing forward the Employment (Allocation of Tips) Bill.

Following the snap general election that year, the Queen's Speech incorporated the measures into a proposed Employment Bill - but it did not materialise in the last parliamentary session.

The Queen's Speech in May 2021 did not list an Employment Bill or a specific tips bill.

Law will 'create confidence for consumers'

Now, Tory MP Virginia Crosbie has sponsored the bill - and on Friday it cleared its final hurdle in the Commons and will progress to the House of Lords for further scrutiny.

Speaking during the bill's third reading on Friday, Ms Crosbie told MPs: ""The tipping bill has a simple message: to promote fairness and to promote transparency, to ensure that workers receive the tips they earn.

""This will create a level playing field for businesses who are already passing on tips to workers in a fair and transparent way.

""It will create confidence for consumers, who will know that the full value of the tip that they give will go to the workers.""

She added: ""It is estimated that this bill will benefit around one million workers in the sector, with a financial benefit of around £200 each year.

""With the cost of living at the front of a lot of people's minds, this bill will help those workers who are wrongly not receiving the money that they are due from the tips that they have earned.""

Business minister Kevin Hollinrake said the bill will protect workers from ""bad bosses"" and give them an avenue to seek remedies.

He said: ""Businesses will be assured they are not being undercut by companies where bosses are keeping tips for themselves.

""Consumers will have increased confidence that their tips are going to the workers they are intended for.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120160332/http://news.sky.com/story/new-bill-guaranteeing-tips-for-hospitality-workers-moves-closer-to-becoming-law-12791148
59;Ukraine war: Wagner Group suffers heavy losses as their boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, steps firmly into the spotlight;Friday 20 January 2023 16:16, UK;['diana magnay', '@dimagnaysky'];[];['men', 'steps', 'fighters', 'kremlin', 'prigozhin', 'russia', 'yevgeny', 'ukraine', 'suffers', 'sledgehammer', 'wagner', 'heavy', 'spotlight', 'losses', 'russias', 'war', 'group'];"The graves are all fresh. Row after row of them, almost identical. The same mound of sandy soil, the same black, red and yellow wreath mounted with a golden star.

The same wooden, orthodox cross to mark the grave, though there are some Muslim headstones too. Just the names and the dates on a small bronze plaque to distinguish the lives extinguished. None of them lived to a ripe old age.

This is a cemetery for Wagner mercenaries near Krasnodar in southern Russia. Krasnodar region is the Wagner Group's heartland. Their training ground is nearby in a village called Molkino.

There is a newly built chapel not far away which houses the urns of cremated fighters. And there is space available for still more graves in this cemetery, when the next wave of bodies come home.

Wagner is heavily involved in Russia's offensive around Bakhmut and Soledar in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region. Its fighters have died, Ukraine says, in their thousands.

Most likely the bulk of those were convicts, sent in to die like cannon fodder and be buried in a Wagner cemetery far from home. Perhaps after time in Russia's penal colonies they no longer had homes to speak of.

Image: The rows of graves of Wagner fighters are almost identical

""The area near Soledar is covered with corpses of the invaders… This is what madness looks like"", Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in one of his nightly addresses.

Russia claims to be in control of Soledar, a victory that Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, declares as his own.

In the last few days he has also claimed to be behind the capture of the village of Klishchiivka about nine kilometres south of Bakhmut, though that has yet to be confirmed from the Ukrainian side. Russia's Ministry of Defence has been less gracious about Wagner's role but it has conceded that they played a role in capturing Soledar.

Live updates from Ukraine war

There are rumours, dismissed by the Kremlin as media speculation, that army boss Valery Gerasimov was brought in to replace Sergey Surovikin as head of Ukraine operations partly to keep Prigozhin in line.

Putting the top military commander in charge of Russia's ""special military operation"" could be interpreted as a way of reinforcing army hierarchy and reminding Prigozhin and his band of mercenaries who is ultimately in charge.

Prigozhin, who just a few months ago refused to confirm the well-known secret that he ran the Wagner Group and sued anyone who suggested otherwise, has come out in public all guns blazing. There is no longer a need for the ""regime of silence"", he said.

There are videos of him now in the salt mines around Bakhmut where US officials believe he has an eye on the mineral spoils.

There are videos of him handing out medals to his fighters. There are videos of him surveying piles of body bags behind the frontlines and attending funerals back home. He has not shied away from his losses, demanding the same burial rights for his men as for regular army soldiers.

He has shown himself willing to be a presence at the frontlines, quite the battleground commander, which is more than can be said for the ultimate commander-in-chief who, unlike Ukraine's president, has paid no visits to the front.

Prigozhin's PR team provide quick responses, purportedly from the man himself, to media questions. In a recent salvo, he takes aim at Kremlin bureaucrats who he says are longing for Russia to lose the war and for the US to start calling the shots in Russia. But the US ""won't take you in"", he writes to these supposed Kremlin traitors. ""And then you will come to us, where the Wagner sledgehammer will be waiting for you.""

Image: It is getting harder for the Wagner Group to recruit fighters after heavy losses

The sledgehammer is no idle threat. In November, video appeared purporting to show a Wagner mercenary bludgeoned to death with a sledgehammer for defecting to Ukraine. When asked to comment, Prigozhin replied, ""a dog receives a dog's death"".

Later that month, a bloodied sledgehammer in a violin case was presented to the European Parliament as they debated declaring Russia a terrorist state, a sinister message from the group also known in Russia as ""The musicians"".

But losing that many men creates problems and the recruitment drive in Russia's prisons is reportedly drying up.

Paul Whelan, a US citizen (who also holds British citizenship) and was jailed in 2018 on espionage charges, told his brother David that Wagner recruiters had little luck the last time they came round his prison colony. ""Everyone else has a clear picture of what happens to prisoners who go to fight the Kremlin's war in Ukraine"", David Whelan wrote in his regular email updates. This time round, they reportedly managed to sign up just eight men, compared with 115 on the previous occasion.

Prigozhin is a powerful man. He is unashamedly critical of both Russia's senior military command and of the Kremlin elites though he does not say a bad word about Vladimir Putin.

Wagner has played a key role for years already as an unofficial arm of Russian foreign policy in Syria, Libya and other African countries.

Now in Ukraine, the group is out in the open. But Ukraine is a far bloodier battlefield and the fight more existential, both for the Wagner Group and for Putin's Russia, which has enabled men like Prigozhin, with his brutal, sledgehammer tradecraft, to flourish.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120173319/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-wagner-group-suffers-heavy-losses-as-their-boss-yevgeny-prigozhin-steps-firmly-into-the-spotlight-12790830

Mass deaths of the animals on the coastline from Hartlepool to Whitby saw swathes of crabs washed ashore between October and December 2021.

It resulted in distressing scenes of huge numbers of dead and dying marine life on beaches.

Fishing crews also warned that the event was ""catastrophic"" for their livelihoods.

Academic research suggested the deaths were caused by industrial pollutant pyridine, possibly from dredging in the mouth of the River Tees to maintain channels for port traffic.

But the independent panel, made up of academics, industry experts and chaired by the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs' (Defra) chief scientific adviser Gideon Henderson, found that it was ""very unlikely"" the cause of death was pyridine or another pollutant.

Researchers from the Environment Agency and York University did not detect pyridine in the seawater, and toxic chemicals found in the River Tees were ""significantly lower"" than what would cause crab mortality, the panel said.

They instead concluded it was ""about as likely as not"" that a pathogen - a potential disease or parasite - new to UK waters caused the crab deaths.

In a statement, the panel said: ""Although there is no direct evidence of a novel pathogen, it would explain the key observations including mortality over a sustained period and along 70km of coastline, the unusual twitching of dying crabs and the deaths being predominantly crabs rather than other species.

""It is also possible that a combination of factors lead to the unusual mortality, rather than one of the factors the panel considered.""

An earlier investigation into the incident, led by Defra, had pointed the finger at an algal bloom as the likely cause.

However, the new report also found this was ""unlikely"".

Dead and dying marine life have been washing up on beaches around Teesside for almost a year since the autumn 2021 deaths, according to official documents and eyewitness reports seen by Sky News.

Dr Gary Caldwell, a marine biologist at the University of Newcastle, said: ""There have been ongoing die-offs.""

Analysis by Mark Stone, US correspondent



The impasse over tanks rumbles on.

It looks like a wedge emerging in western unity over Ukraine; countries split on whether to supply critical tanks the frontline.

We've been here before though. Throughout this near-year-long war, western countries have been reticent about just how hard to hammer Russia for fear of crossing Putin’s unpredictable red lines.

At the start, the Germans were ridiculed for only being prepared to supply helmets. Since then Berlin has become one of the foremost suppliers of weapons to Ukraine. But, for now, tanks is a step too far for the Germans.

Through the course of the conflict military strategists have used the phrase ""boil the frog"".

The analogy goes that it's better to bring the water containing the frog to the boil gradually. If you throw the frog into boiling water, it'll jump out. Then what?

Applied to Ukraine, the balance is whether the west gradually increases the weaponry, allowing Ukraine to switch to offensive warfare, not just defensive. This is to boil the frog; to wear down the Russian military and leadership over time.

The new $2.5bn package from America will help do that. There's so much in there.

But Ukraine wants the ability to deliver a knock out blow Russia now. The question, always, had been how would Russia react?

Even here in Washington, military types are split on whether to boil the frog slowly. Or to throw it in.

As one source said to me - now's the time to throw it in and when it jumps out, stamp on it.

The tanks will come, but not just yet.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120173319/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-no-decision-on-sending-crucial-tanks-to-ukraine-despite-pressure-on-germany-to-release-them-12541713

Questions have swirled following an article in The Sun on Sunday, which claimed a seven-figure payment was made by Mr Zahawi to end a dispute with the taxman ""after scrutiny of his family's financial affairs"".

The paper alleged there were questions over his use of an offshore company - a Gibraltar-registered family trust called Balshore Investments - to hold shares in the polling firm YouGov.

Mr Zahawi has previously denied he was a beneficiary of Balshore Investments.

After the Guardian newspaper earlier on Friday reiterated the allegation that Mr Zahawi agreed to pay a penalty to HMRC as part of a seven-figure settlement, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner has called for him to be ""dismissed"".

""Rishi Sunak promised a government of integrity, professionalism, and accountability but instead he's propping up a motley crew of scandal-ridden ministers,"" she said in a statement.

""Nadhim Zahawi's story doesn't add up.

""The position of the man who was until recently in charge of the UK's tax system and who this prime minister appointed Conservative Party Chair is now untenable.

""It's time for Rishi Sunak to put his money where his mouth is and dismiss Nadhim Zahawi from his cabinet.""

Mr Zahawi was seen going into Number 10 Downing Street on Friday and did not respond when asked by Sky News political correspondent Rob Powell if he had been honest about his tax affairs.

'The public requires answers'

Sky News has made a number of approaches to the Tory MP and his team to clarify the situation around the payment to HMRC, but he has still not revealed if the report is accurate.

Instead, we received a broader comment from the MP's spokesperson, who said his tax affairs ""were and are fully up to date and are paid in the UK"", adding: ""He has always said that he will answer any questions from HMRC as he always has done.""

HMRC has said it does not comment on individual cases, but Labour deputy leader Ms Rayner said ""given the public interest"" in the case ""the public requires answers"".

She claimed: ""In particular, there appears to be an element of special treatment directed towards Nadhim Zahawi by HMRC.""

Zahawi’s responses to tax dispute claims carefully worded Rob Powell Political correspondent @robpowellnews Questions about Nadhim Zahawi’s financial affairs followed him through his relatively short-lived campaign to become prime minister last summer. The allegations centre on his links to a Gibraltar-based trust 'Balshore Investments Limited', of which his father Hareth Zahawi is a director. Nadhim Zahawi has said that neither he nor his wife benefit from this trust. However, when he founded the polling firm YouGov in May 2000, the trust was allocated shares in the company equalling the number given to Mr Zahawi’s co-founder Stephan Shakespeare. After digging through pages of documents, the accountant and tax campaigner Dan Neidle has suggested there would have been a tax saving of several million pounds when these shares were sold because they were held by an offshore trust. It’s this figure the Guardian is suggesting is at the centre of the reported repayment to HMRC. Nadhim Zahawi’s responses to these stories have always been very specific and carefully worded. After these latest accusations, a spokesperson for the Tory chairman said he “does not recognise these numbers” and has “never sought legal advice for dealing with HMRC”. They also insisted Mr Zahawi’s taxes were up to date and fully paid in the UK. Sources have briefed that Dan Neidle – who is a Labour member – is a “labour activist” and the allegations are merely taken from his “blog”. One of Mr Zahawi’s more outspoken interventions came during the Number 10 leadership race in July last year though, when he said he was the victim of a “smear” over his financial affairs That statement puts the cabinet minister in a difficult spot if concrete evidence emerges that he has repaid money to HMRC and potentially even been issued with a penalty. The timing of any investigation or settlement could be important as well, given Mr Zahawi was briefly chancellor last year.

Ms Rayner called on HMRC to explain the nature of the payment and whether the former chancellor ""has admitted fault or incurred financial penalties as part of his settlement"".

A spokesman for Mr Zahawi has said his taxes are ""properly declared"" and he ""has never had to instruct any lawyers to deal with HMRC on his behalf"".

""As we have repeatedly said, Nadhim's taxes are up to date and are fully paid in the UK. Mr Zahawi does not recognise these numbers and he has never sought legal advice for dealing with HMRC,"" the spokesman said.

PM 'has full confidence' in Zahawi

Mr Sunak defended his colleague at Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) on Wednesday, saying Mr Zahawi ""has already addressed this matter in full and there's nothing more that I can add"".

Downing Street was pressed for more information during a press briefing on Friday.

Asked if any concerns had been raised about Mr Zahawi's taxes before Mr Sunak made him party chair, the prime minister's official spokesman said he was not aware of any ""specific"" conversations.

Before entering politics, Mr Zahawi co-founded YouGov and is thought to have a net worth of around £100m.

Questions over his tax affairs have been raised before - namely ahead of his short tenure as chancellor in the closing days of Boris Johnson's premiership.

The Observer claimed civil servants in the Cabinet Office's propriety and ethics team alerted the prime minister to an HMRC ""flag"" over Mr Zahawi before his appointment, but Mr Johnson went ahead ""despite the possible concerns over his tax affairs"".

The minister claimed he was ""clearly being smeared"" in his campaign to become Conservative Party leader, telling Sky News he had ""always"" paid his taxes and had ""declared"" them in the UK.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120173319/http://news.sky.com/story/nadhim-zahawi-labour-calls-on-pm-to-dismiss-tory-chairman-amid-tax-dispute-claims-and-slams-motley-crew-of-scandal-ridden-ministers-12790822

Speaking on the fringes of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said the mood at the Swiss resort seemed to lack the urgency needed to keep global warming to 1.5C.

The organisation he leads works with countries around the world to shape energy policies for a secure and sustainable future.

But Mr Birol said: ""I have the feeling that climate change and its urgency is sliding down the agenda.

""The energy crisis is very important - it's crucial.

""The food crisis is very important.

""But the climate crisis is very important as well.

""I don't see the commitment and engagement from people that I have seen in the last few years… It is not something that we can forget and it is a real issue.""

The comments came as climate protestors, including Greta Thunberg, marched in Davos, urging investors gathered here not to put more money into new fossil fuel projects.

Most of the WEF attendees had already left the summit by the time of Friday's march, but Ms Thunberg and others met the previous day with Mr Birol, whose institution has said if the world is to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions it must refrain from any new oil and gas exploration projects.

The forum's annual winter meetings - the first to take place since 2020 - were dominated by discussion about the global economy and by Ukraine.

While climate discussions remained prominent, they were less prominent than at that last meeting.

'It's either now or never'

Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament, argued it was now incumbent on her fellow politicians to address the challenge.

She told Sky News: ""We are the last generation of politicians that can address this.

""Previous ones didn't. It's either now or never. Our voters want it from us. Our younger generations want it from us. If we don't decide, we can't leave it to them.""

The tank is old - a relic from a time gone by - but it is nonetheless all the crew of the 24th mechanised brigade have to defend themselves against Russian aggression.

With the whoosh of rockets and thump of artillery reverberating through the copse, the crew explains what they are up against and what they need to end this fight.

Zelenskyy says 'one European capital' holding up delivery of crucial tanks - war latest

""Tanks were created for supporting infantry, not for defence but for attacking, so for example to liberate our territories we definitely need tanks because it's like a fiery fist and a force to advance,"" Roman, the company commander, says.

""This one is such a stupid tank - just a simple rocket launcher made a long, long time ago could be a really serious threat to it, but modern tanks are equipped better and they're safer from such types of weapon.""

At the beginning of the war, military planners debated whether the time of the tank was over.

But this is a ground war with a line of contact extending for hundreds of miles.

Wherever you look along the front, you can see smoke on the bruised horizon from artillery strikes and the flash from the muzzles of big guns.

We were taken to another position on the frontline where rusty old tanks - mainly donated by Eastern European countries - lurk in the trees.

They are still lethal when locked and loaded but in the face of a sustained Russian assault they are simply no match.

Ukraine conflict has turned into an attritional fight

Ukraine fears Western fatigue and an everlasting stalemate will sound the death knell for the country.

It has had tactical successes, such as the liberation of Kherson and the Kharkiv regions, but without even greater Western support maintaining operational tempo and initiative will be difficult.

Russian forces are well dug in.

The conflict has turned into an attritional fight across trenches.

And as tanks helped break the deadlock of the western front in the First World War, military planners in Kyiv are hoping to do the same in this conflict more than a century later.

They need protection and manoeuvrability to push their infantry forwards - something only modern western tanks, they argue, can provide.

All the indications are that Moscow is in for the long fight and is planning a major offensive with hundreds of thousands of men in the spring.

But this is about much more than simply holding position.

Vladimir Putin claims a Russian victory is inevitable but Ukraine says with the right equipment it can do far more than hold Moscow back - it can keep pushing forward and win this war.

What they don't understand here is the slowness to commit by some Western countries.

A group of 22 volunteers, part of a co-design panel, took a test journey on the autonomous single-decker over the Forth Road Bridge near Edinburgh on Thursday, operator Stagecoach said.

Fleur Dijkman was one of the local bus users recruited to provide ideas on how an autonomous service should work.

She said: ""I wasn't worried at all about it. You wouldn't know the difference between this and a normal bus from the driving.""

Ms Dijkman, who joined the panel through a forum for young people, said: ""It's brilliant to see it come through and become this actual thing from a few drawings. It was quite exciting, the thought of getting on for the first time.""

The vehicle has sensors enabling it to run on pre-selected roads without a driver having to take control.

An experienced driver will be on board when the buses are fully operational, but to monitor the system, rather than to drive it.

Image: Twenty-two volunteers from a co-design panel made the trip

A bus captain will help passengers with boarding, buying tickets and any queries.

The plan is to have five self-driving buses operating on the 14-mile journey between Ferrytoll park-and-ride in Fife and the Edinburgh Park train and tram interchange via the bridge from the spring.

It is part of the CAVForth project which is expected to have five self-driving buses run timetabled services between Ferrytoll park-and-ride in Fife and the Edinburgh Park train and tram interchange via the bridge from the spring.

The buses will travel in mixed traffic at speeds of up to 50mph, with capacity for around 10,000 journeys per week, as part of the CAVForth project.

The on-road testing follows successful depot-based trials, track testing and virtual simulation which Stagecoach said put the autonomous buses through their paces to fine-tune the drive systems.

Ivan McKee, the Scottish government's business minister, called it a ""hugely significant step"".

""It has been really encouraging to watch the project develop through the various steps, from early testing and demonstrations through to carrying of passengers along the route for the first time,"" he said.

Louise Simpson, operations director and CAVForth lead project manager for Stagecoach, said: ""Until today, only project team members had been able to trial the autonomous service so it's great that our co-design panel have had this opportunity, and we welcome any views they have.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120174727/http://news.sky.com/story/self-driving-buses-passengers-travel-on-full-size-vehicle-for-the-first-time-in-the-uk-12791113

Lancashire Police issued the notice after the prime minister appeared without a belt in a clip on Instagram as he promoted his levelling-up funding in Lancashire.

A Number 10 spokesperson said: ""The prime minister fully accepts this was a mistake and has apologised. He will of course comply with the fixed penalty.""

In a statement, the force said: ""You will be aware that a video has been circulating on social media showing an individual failing to wear a seatbelt while a passenger in a moving car in Lancashire.

""After looking into this matter, we have today (Friday, January 20) issued a 42-year-old man from London with a conditional offer of fixed penalty.""

PM admits mistake and will pay fine - politics latest

The PM previously apologised for the ""brief error of judgment"" as he carried out a series of visits in Lancashire on Thursday to announce the latest wave of levelling up funding.

Mr Sunak has previously been fined by the Met Police for breaking lockdown rules.

He received a financial penalty alongside Boris Johnson from the Metropolitan Police for attending a gathering to mark the then-PM's 56th birthday - in spite of the coronavirus restrictions in place.

Earlier, Downing Street said Mr Sunak ""fully accepts this was a mistake and apologises"".

A Number 10 spokesman told reporters ""of course"" the prime minister does not believe anyone is above the law, adding that he ""believes it is important for people to wear their seatbelt"".

""It was an error of judgment, he removed it for a short period of time to film a clip, which you've seen, but he accepts that was a mistake,"" the spokesman added.

Fines of up to £500 can be issued for failing to wear a seatbelt when one is available.

There are a few exemptions, including when a car is being used for police, fire and rescue services, and for certified medical issues.

Mr Sunak came to office promising ""integrity"" after the scandals that eventually forced Mr Johnson from office.

In his first speech outside Downing Street, he pledged ""integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level"".

Sunak's slip-ups could be exploited by opponents to brand him out of touch Joe Pike Political correspondent @joepike Downing Street will be hoping that once the PM has paid up, voters and journalists will move on and forget this rather embarrassing unforced error. To Rishi Sunak’s credit, he put his hands up and admitted the error almost immediately. But it is a reminder that in the top job, with a permacrisis of strikes, NHS delays and high inflation, mistakes can slip through the Number 10 net. Failing to wear a seatbelt is illegal, but filming it and publishing the evidence on social media suggests a lack of checks within the PM's team. This is the second police fine Mr Sunak has received in 9 months, after the Met Police punished him for attending a lockdown-busting birthday gathering for Boris Johnson. In recent months Mr Sunak has struggled with contactless payments, had an awkward conversation with a homeless man about financial services, and demonstrated a fondness for using private jets to travel around the UK even for relatively short journeys. Added together, such slip-ups may be exploited by the PM's enemies to claim he is out of touch. There is certainly a danger these small missteps distract from Rishi Sunak’s attempts to stabilise the economy and sort out seemingly intractable issues like migrant crossings and delayed discharges. Like many occupants of Number 11, Rishi Sunak was a ‘submarine chancellor’. Invisible below the waves for months on end, he occasionally rose from the deep to launch a killer economic intervention: his “whatever it takes” COVID budget, the furlough scheme, Eat Out To Help Out. But as Gordon Brown (the last politician to move from 11 to 10) found, similar manoeuvres are not possible as prime minister. You are constantly in the spotlight. And it is an unsparing existence.

Labour had said it would be ""very serious"" if Mr Sunak was to receive a second fine.

Yesterday, Lancashire Police confirmed they would be ""looking into"" the incident in a statement.

One Conservative MP had suggested police were wasting their time by investigating the incident.

Blackpool MP Scott Benton said ""politically motivated complaints"" about the offence is ""not good use of frontline resources"".

Despite only being in office since October, Mr Sunak's premiership has already been hit with a set of controversies, from criticism for reinstating Suella Braverman as home secretary just six days after she was forced to step down over a security breach to an ongoing bullying inquiry into Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120190217/http://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-gets-fixed-penalty-notice-after-being-caught-not-wearing-seatbelt-12790847

The King met the Three Lions boss at Norbrook Youth Club in Manchester to hear the life stories of young people supported by his charity, the Prince's Trust.

The youth club was where Manchester United star and home-town hero Marcus Rashford played pool with his friends when not training with his club.

The 25-year-old England international was praised by the Queen Consort, who unveiled a donation of books from the striker.

Camilla described the player's gesture as ""wonderful"", while his international manager Southgate described the forward, who has won praise for his campaigning on youth issues, as ""impressive"".

The meeting was part of a whistlestop tour of Greater Manchester by the King and Queen Consort, their first public outing together since the release of Prince Harry's memoir Spare ten days ago.

Earlier in the day, the pair waved to gathered crowds outside Bolton Town Hall on Friday morning before the King visited the world's biggest Corn Flakes factory in Manchester.

Charles joked he was a year late to visit the factory, which celebrated its centenary in 2022.

The Manchester site is the biggest cereal factory in Europe, producing breakfast favourites including Corn Flakes, Frosties, Rice Krispies, Crunchy Nut and Coco Pops.

He heard about efforts to reduce salt and sugar content and asked about the popularity of Coco Pops as he stood in front of a strawberry and white chocolate version of the cereal.

At one point as he chatted to workers, he said he thinks molasses is ""very special"".

The King wore a white coat for a walk around the factory floor, where he stopped and chatted to staff.

John Yates, 28, was attempting to skip traffic merging for roadworks on the M6 in Cheshire when he smashed into the back of Christopher Smith's Peugeot 107.

Smith had slowed down to meet the temporary 50mph speed limit, while Yates' white Volkswagen Scirocco was travelling at 128mph at the time of the crash.

Yates fled the scene, while Mr Smith, a 41-year-old, from St Helens, sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken to the Salford Royal hospital.

Mr Smith died in hospital the following day. His wife was heavily pregnant at the time of his death.

A 28-year-old woman from Preston and a 25-year-old passenger, who were in another car that was also struck in the crash, both escaped with minor injuries.

On Friday, Yates, of no fixed abode but from North Wales, appeared at Chester Crown Court where he was sentenced to 11 years in prison - reduced to eight years and three months for an early guilty plea - after admitting to causing death by dangerous driving and failing to provide a specimen.

The court heard how the collision took place around 12.30am on Tuesday 15 November last year, on the M6 northbound between junctions 20, Lymm, and 21, Thelwall.

Temporary roadworks and a 50mph speed limit were in place at the time, with all vehicles required to merge into the fast lane.

Despite multiple signs warning of the roadworks ahead, Yates continued to travel at high speed and undertook a number of vehicles to skip the traffic.

As he approached the area where the traffic was merging, Yates' white Volkswagen Scirocco collided with the side of a Peugeot 307 before hitting Mr Smith's Peugeot 107 at high speed.

After the crash, Yates left his car and ran off.

Yates returned to the motorway five hours later and was arrested at the scene.

After the sentencing, Sergeant Simon Degg, of the Serious and Complex Collision Investigation Unit, described Yates' actions as ""cowardly"".

""Rather than staying to try to help Christopher and face the consequences of his actions, he ran off and left him to die,"" he said.

""Even after he was located, he denied any involvement in the collision, and throughout questioning he declined to answer any questions and refused to provide samples of breath or blood.

""His parting comments to investigators was that he puts all of his trust in those investigating the collision.""

Paying tribute to Mr Smith, Sergeant Degg said: ""Christopher was a true gentleman, he had left work early that day so that he could spend time with his heavily pregnant wife.

""He was excited at the prospect of becoming a dad and a gentleman who was doing nothing wrong whatsoever.

""Because of the actions taken by Yates that day, Christopher will never get to meet his child and be the loving father that he would have been.""

In addition to his prison sentence, Yates was banned from driving for seven years, to commence once released from prison.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120190217/http://news.sky.com/story/dangerous-driver-jailed-after-killing-father-to-be-in-128mph-crash-on-the-m6-12791213

The Turnaround Plan coincides with another week of scandal for the Met after the crimes of rapist PC David Carrick were revealed.

The plan has nine priorities including building the ""strongest ever neighbourhood policing"", improving public protection and safeguarding, giving victims a ""compassionate"" service, and showing communities ""we care and respect them"".

It comes as the Carrick case prompted separate, urgent action to double-check all police to see if anyone of concern has slipped through the net.

All police in England and Wales must be checked against national databases by the end of March, the National Police Chiefs' Council said on Friday.

Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the next two years would be critical and that he was ""determined to win back Londoners' trust"".

He also again condemned the ""appalling criminality"" of Carrick and the missed chances to stop him.

""I know our communities need to see reform in the Met, on issues of standards and culture but also in how we do more to reduce crime,"" he said.

""We must and will act now,"" he added.

""My promise to you is I, my senior team and the tens of thousands of hard-working and honest officers and staff will reform the Met and do all we can to give Londoners confidence in their police service,"" Sir Mark said in a statement on Friday.

However, he admitted that ""painful truths"" had been revealed that would ""not be resolved overnight"".

The plan also includes attending every home burglary, an extra 1,600 Police Community Support Officers, a new anti-corruption and abuse command, and doing more to target men who use violence against women and girls.

Londoners have 12 weeks to give feedback on the plan, which is published on the Met's website. An updated version will then be published in April.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he ""wholeheartedly"" backed the plan and would start with funding 500 more PCSOs with more investment to be announced in the coming weeks.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120191725/http://news.sky.com/story/met-police-chief-reveals-plan-to-reform-the-service-and-restore-trust-in-wake-of-david-carrick-case-12791326

The snapshot survey showed 46% of people would vote to leave the UK, while 54% would vote to stay.

It is the first poll on independence of the year and comes after a number of polls towards the end of 2022 suggested a spike in support for Scotland leaving the UK in the wake of the Supreme Court judgement on 'Indyref2'.

However, the new poll took place before the UK Government used its Section 35 powers to block Holyrood's gender recognition reform legislation, triggering another constitutional dispute.

The latest poll was carried out by Survation for advisory company True North, with 1,002 Scots being surveyed between 10 January and 12 January.

It also asked respondents how they would vote if the next Westminster election was a ""de facto referendum on Scottish independence"".

Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, has suggested using the next general election in this way.

Under this scenario, the SNP were on 45% of the vote when undecideds and those who would refuse to vote are removed - far below the 50% mark Ms Sturgeon would hope to reach.

Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice said: ""There is no evidence in the poll that fighting the next election as a de facto referendum would reduce the level of SNP support.

""Rather, slightly more voters (45%) say that they would vote for the SNP in that circumstance.""

However, Mr Curtice said Friday's poll ""suggests that the spike in support for independence registered after the Supreme Court judgement on indyref2 has proven to be temporary"".

""In truth, if the SNP are going to win over 50% of the vote in either kind of election, the party will need first to persuade more people of the case for independence.""

Ms Sturgeon's hopes of holding a second vote on independence were put on hold in November last year when the Supreme Court ruled Holyrood does not have the power to hold a referendum without the UK Government's permission.

The SNP leader said in the wake of the ruling that she intended to use the next general election as a de facto referendum on independence.

In a keynote address at the Business for Scotland annual dinner on Thursday evening, Ms Sturgeon said a recent move by Westminster to block gender reforms are a ""full-frontal assault"" on devolution and strengthens the case for Scottish independence.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120191725/http://news.sky.com/story/majority-of-scots-would-vote-against-independence-new-poll-suggests-12791201

There are some interesting comments coming from the White House tonight.

Spokesperson John Kirby said it is expected that the Wagner Group - which is highly active in eastern parts of Ukraine - will continue to receive weapons from North Korea.

He said the US is calling on the hermit state to halt shipments.

The US has also shared satellite images alleging to provide evidence that the country is sending weaponry to the Russian mercenary group.

North Korea has previously denied supplying the Wagner Group with arms.

Mr Kirby added that approximately 50,000 Wagner Group personnel have been deployed to Ukraine.

He also turned to the situation regarding the donation of German-made Leopard 2 tanks.

But it is a reminder that in the top job, with a permacrisis of strikes, NHS delays and high inflation, mistakes can slip through the Number 10 net.

This is the second police fine Mr Sunak has received in nine months, after the Met Police punished him for attending a lockdown-busting birthday gathering for Boris Johnson.

In recent months Mr Sunak has struggled with contactless payments, had an awkward conversation with a homeless man about financial services, and demonstrated a fondness for using private jets to travel around the UK even for relatively short journeys.

Added together, such slip-ups may be exploited by the PM's enemies to claim he is out of touch.

There is certainly a danger these small missteps distract from Rishi Sunak’s attempts to stabilise the economy and sort out seemingly intractable issues like migrant crossings and delayed discharges.

A High Court in London approved the settlement amount of around £39m after the child, who cannot be identified, was taken to Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey with ""red flags for meningitis and sepsis"", lawyers said.

After being discharged and given paracetamol for symptoms including a high temperature and drowsiness, lawyers said that it wasn't until she was taken back to A&E; with a rash and a fever, that she was diagnosed with meningococcal sepsis.

The young girl was transferred to another hospital where she suffered from multi-organ failure and subsequently had above-knee amputations of both of her legs and above-elbow amputations of her arms.

She also underwent several other procedures, including skin grafts, to treat the infection.

The Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust admitted liability after the family brought a claim against it, arguing that the child would have avoided amputations and would not have been so ill, if she had been treated urgently with antibiotics.

What is meningococcal sepsis and what are the symptoms? Meningococcal sepsis, also known as septicaemia, is a type of blood poisoning caused by meningococcal disease, according to the NHS. In some individuals, bacteria that causes the disease gets into the blood stream, which multiplies and produces poisons. Babies and young children are at higher risk of getting meningitis and sepsis because their immune systems have not fully developed. Symptoms of meningitis can include: severe headache and stiff neck, dislike of bright lights and being drowsy, less responsive or vacant. Babies may hold their body stiff, have jerky movements or feel floppy. Symptoms of sepsis can include: a rash anywhere on the body either non-blanching or sometimes blotchy red, cold hands and feet, rapid or unusual breathing.

Judge Caspar Glyn KC ""unhesitatingly"" approved the settlement, which will be paid partly in a lump sum and the rest in annual payments for the rest of her life.

The case was described as ""very sad"" by the family's senior barrister, Elizabeth-Anne Gumbel KC, who added that the child has significant scarring over her body.

""She is an extraordinarily brave little girl who is managing in school to do very well academically,"" Ms Gumbel said.

In a letter addressed to the child's parents, Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Neil Dardis, apologised, adding that her care ""fell below the standard (that she) was entitled to expect"" and that she should not have been discharged.

Bradley Martin KC, representing the trust, added: ""There is no amount of money that can truly compensate (her) for her injuries.

""She will have access to the care and technology she needs. It is quite remarkable that despite such devastating injuries, she has such potential.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230120200819/https://news.sky.com/story/extraordinarily-brave-girl-gets-multimillion-pound-settlement-after-losing-all-four-limbs-12791234

Two months after the gathering of world leaders in 2021, the biggest and most complex event undertaken by Devon and Cornwall Police, Jake Davison shot dead his mother and four others with a pump-action shotgun in the Devon city of Plymouth.

At an inquest into the death of his victims on Friday, Superintendent Kara Sherwood said: ""Senior officers went off to plan the G7 and were distracted completely.""

She also said that the force's firearms department was ""fundamentally under-staffed"" in the run-up to the shooting.

She disagreed with Dominic Adamson KC, representing the victims' families, who asked if the safety of world leaders was more important than firearms in the region.

Davison, a 22-year-old apprentice crane operator, killed his mother, Maxine Davison, after an argument then went out on to the street.

He shot dead Sophie Martyn, three, her father Lee Martyn, 43, Stephen Washington, 59, and Kate Shepherd, 66, in the Keyham area of the city before turning the gun on himself.

The force had taken away his shotgun and licence in 2020 after he assaulted two teenagers in a park, but returned them to him weeks before the killings in August 2021.

Ms Sherwood was also asked what she would do in the scenario of a violent offender whose weapon had been seized.

She said: ""I would not return the weapon if it was a particularly violent assault. It is a high-risk decision.""

The inquest heard Davison declared that he had autism on his application, and gave consent for his GP to share information with police about his medical history.

However, Davison's GP refused to provide an opinion to police assessing whether he should be issued with a shotgun certificate.

Chief Superintendent Roy Linden, of Devon and Cornwall Police, told the inquest police should have collected medical evidence about Davison when considering his application for a shotgun licence.

He told the inquest: ""Opinion should have been sought from a GP.""

Addressing the families of the victims, Ms Sherwood also said it was ""unimaginable"" what they were going through and that the incident had ""affected us all personally and professionally"".

She added: ""We, and others, will learn from this.""

Captain Harpreet Chandi, 33, is 67 days into a 1,100-mile trek in Antarctica.

She wrote on Instagram: ""Polar Preet has broken the world record for the longest, solo, unsupported and unassisted polar expedition by any woman in history!""

Team Army, a body that funds military sports, confirmed the feat.

The British Army medical officer, who was appointed MBE in the 2022 Birthday Honours, reached the South Pole for a second time earlier this month.

She has travelled 868 miles (1,397 km) so far in temperatures as cold as -50C (-58F), skiing 13 to 15 hours a day pulling a sledge, which she prepared for by training in Greenland and Norway.

The previous female record was 858 miles (1,381 km), skied by Anja Blacha in 2020.

Capt Chandi, a physiotherapist from Sinfin in Derby, failed to achieve her original aim, however, of becoming the first woman to cross Antarctica solo and unsupported.

After setting off from Hercules Inlet in November, her aim was to reach Reedy Glacier within 75 days.

In an online journey blog, she admitted on Thursday that she ""pretty gutted that I don't have the time to complete the crossing"".

She added: ""I know that I have done a huge journey, it's just difficult while I'm on the ice and I know it's not that far away.""

""I have not yet located the Easter bunny or the tooth fairy, but I still have a couple of days left,"" she joked.

The Prince and Princess of Wales were among those to congratulate her, retweeting the announcement.

Kyiv has been asking its Western backers for months to donate hundreds of modern battle tanks to bolster the ability of its armed forces to launch offensive operations against entrenched Russian positions.

The gathering on Friday of more than 50 nations at a US air base in Germany came at a key moment to respond to this request.

The UK stepped-up, though its hollowed-out forces could only spare 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks.

Poland said it was ready to send a number of its German-made Leopard 2 tanks, but Germany itself - the country with the key to unlock significant numbers of the weapon - blinked.

Image: A Leopard 2A6 battle tank

Instead of any announcement by Berlin there was indecision, despite weeks of mounting pressure on Chancellor Olaf's Scholz from his NATO partners to cross over what had previously been a red line.

Keen to paper over any cracks, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, convener of the Ukraine Contact Group meeting, and his top military officer General Mark Milley insisted the allies were as united as ever.

""I think that over my 43 years in uniform, this is the most unified I've ever seen NATO,"" declared General Milley.

But they also stressed the challenge faced by Ukraine - and the need to ensure military equipment and training provides the capability required to conduct complicated operations drawing on a combination of tanks, armoured fighting vehicles and artillery.

""This year it will be very, very difficult to militarily eject the Russian forces from every inch of Russian-occupied Ukraine,"" General Milley said in a joint press conference at the end of the meeting at the Ramstein base.

In a speech at the Fabian Society Conference tomorrow, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to urge the government to stop the energy price cap rising this spring and warn that millions are under threat by the move.

The government has confirmed that, from April, energy bills will typically rise to £3,000 - while support offered to many individuals will become less generous as ministers try to grapple with the country's finances.

Ms Reeves is expected to say that the government is ""underprepared"" for the hardship that rising bills will cause many households resulting in a ""crisis"".

Setting out Labour's plan to ease the cost of living burden, she will say a Labour government would introduce a tougher windfall tax on energy companies.

The party argues this would help stop the energy cap rising by generating £13bn across 2022 and 2023.

Ms Reeves is expected to say that alongside a freeze on fuel duty, there should be a three-month moratorium on the forced installation of pre-payment meters.

While Labour would also introduce a new fund to ""jump start"" insulation.

""Millions of households are still looking to a 40% increase in their energy bills, in April,"" Ms Reeves will tell the conference.

""On a week when temperatures fell below zero, I know many families and pensioners will be feeling the pressure particularly acutely.

""And at the same time, energy companies continue to enjoy record profits. That cannot be right.""

The US and its allies had hoped to convince Berlin to allow the powerful battle tanks to be used by Kyiv to aid in Ukraine's fightback against Russia.

The UK has already agreed to send 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks, in the hope of pushing Germany into reciprocating, while Poland has said it is ready to send a number of its Leopard 2s if Berlin, which holds the export licence, agrees.

On Friday, representatives from more than 50 allied nations met at a US air base in Germany for a meeting Ukrainian defence chiefs hoped would finally end the lengthy back-and-forths.

Kyiv says the tanks will bolster the ability of its armed forces to launch offensive operations against entrenched Russian positions.

But the summit at Ramstein air base ended without an agreement on tanks, despite pleas from Kyiv officials.

Ukraine war latest: West fails to make decision on sending tanks to Ukraine

As the talks concluded, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged Kyiv would have to keep fighting to ensure it has enough heavy armour.

But he said the Ramstein meeting, which instead ended with billions of dollars in commitments, would strengthen Ukraine's resilience.

""Yes, we will still have to fight for the delivery of modern tanks, but every day we make it more obvious that there is no alternative to taking a decision about tanks,"" he said.

US defence secretary Lloyd Austin, who attended the summit alongside his counterparts from Ukraine and Germany, said Ukraine was well-equipped even without the Leopard 2s.

It announced a package of $2.5bn (£2bn) in military aid ahead of Friday's talks, including Stryker armoured personnel carriers and more Bradley fighting vehicles.

Sources in Germany have suggested Berlin may change its reluctance to allow Leopard tanks to be sent to Ukraine, if the US sends its Abrams tanks too.

Defence chief Boris Pistorius - who only took up the job this week after his predecessor was forced to resign - defended his country's position and insisted Germany did ""not fear anything"" by allowing the use of Leopard 2s.

""We just have a responsibility for our population in Germany and in Europe and we have to balance all the pros and contras before we decide things like that,"" Mr Pistorius said.

Why does Ukraine want Leopard 2 tanks? Dominic Waghorn International Affairs Editor @DominicWaghorn The Ukrainians have a lot of tanks, but they're also T tanks, mainly the T-64 and T-72, which are old and vulnerable to Russian attack. To repel a springtime Russian offensive they need modern battle tanks which are far better protected, faster and more deadly. The best tank for Ukraine would be the German-made Leopard 2. Tanks are rated on their ability to strike other targets and their resilience from attack. The Leopard 2 moves fast, has state-of-the-art targeting and is well protected by armour. It is also, crucially, operated by 14 European countries, so spare parts are widely available. Britain is sending Challengers - a highly capable tank - but the UK can only spare around a dozen of them. Ukraine wants 300 tanks. Experts say if it gets 100 that will be enough to make a difference. Read more here.

Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleskii Reznikov said on Twitter that he had ""a frank discussion"" with Mr Pistorius on Friday about the supply of Leopard tanks, adding that the talks would continue.

Top US military officer General Mark Milley, meanwhile, attempted to put on a show of unity.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: ""On 19 January 2023, four individuals were charged in connection with an investigation into alleged human trafficking and immigration offences. A report will be sent to the prosecutor fiscal.""

A spokeswoman for the 80-year-old businesswoman strongly denied the allegations.

""Whilst we cannot comment on the details of an ongoing investigation, Dame Ann Gloag strongly disputes the malicious allegations that have been made against her, her foundation and members of her family.""

The spokeswoman added: ""(She) will vigorously defend herself and the work of her foundation to protect her legacy and continue her work helping thousands of people in the UK and abroad every year.""

Dame Ann is one of Scotland's richest women, having founded the Stagecoach Group with her brother in 1980.

The business, which began by running coaches from Dundee to London, became one of the UK's biggest bus and coach firms, operating routes across the country.

She has participated in philanthropic work, which, having trained as a nurse in her twenties, has often centred around healthcare.

Dame Ann also has a foundation aimed at tackling poverty and encouraging the advancement of education, health and religion in the UK and overseas.

North Korea has previously denied the claims as has Wagner owner Yevgeny Prigozhin, who last month called it ""gossip and speculation"".

The White House said the satellite image was taken on 18 November and showed a Russian train travelling to North Korea to collect the arms.

""On November 19, North Korea loaded the railcars with shipping containers, and the train returned to Russia,"" said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby.

""While we assess that the amount of material delivered to Wagner has not changed battlefield dynamics in Ukraine, we expect that it will continue to receive North Korean weapons systems,"" he said.

Tougher sanctions will also be imposed against the Wagner Group and its global support network next week when the US declares it an Transnational Criminal Organization (TCO), Mr Kirby added.

Mr Kirby said: ""With these actions, and more to come, our message to any company that is considering providing support to Wagner is this - Wagner is a criminal organisation that is committing widespread atrocities and human rights abuses, and we will work relentlessly to identify, disrupt, expose, and target those assisting Wagner.""

He estimated that the private security company has about 50,000 personnel fighting alongside Russia troops in Ukraine - 40,000 of them convicts signed up from Russian prisons.

The ruling ordered the former US president and his lawyer Alina Habba to pay nearly $938,000 (£758,626) to the defendants in the case, after claiming they conspired to sway the outcome of his winning presidential campaign by working with Russia.

In the wake of the sanction, Mr Trump withdrew his lawsuit against New York attorney general Letitia James, which was first filed in 2021.

US district judge Donald M Middlebrooks, who first dismissed the case in September, called the lawsuit against Mr Trump's 2016 rival Mrs Clinton, former top FBI officials and the Democratic Party, ""completely frivolous, both factually and legally"" and one which ""amounts to obstruction of justice"".

Citing other legal action that Mr Trump is embroiled within, Mr Middlebrooks described the former president as a ""prolific and sophisticated litigant"" who uses the courts ""to seek revenge on political adversaries"".

""He is the mastermind of strategic abuse of the judicial process,"" Mr Middlebrooks added.

A spokesman for Mr Trump and Ms Habba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In another legal case, Mr Trump sued media conglomerate CNN for defamation in October last year.

He is seeking $475m (£420m) in punitive damages, claiming the network had carried out a ""campaign of libel and slander"" against him.

97;The rise of the pro controller: Why gamers are spending more than £200 for a new pad;Saturday 21 January 2023 00:28, UK;[];['gaming'];['ps5', 'xbox', 'pad', 'controller', 'playstation', 'pic', 'nintendo', 'wolverine', '200', 'gamers', 'spending', 'pro', 'v2', 'controllers', 'rise'];"We've all been there: you're on track to win a match of Call Of Duty or Fortnite, only to be outgunned at the last minute by a teenager with Spider-Man-esque reaction speeds.

Should you throw your PlayStation controller out the window in anger, you may want to replace it with one of the increasing number of ""pro"" controllers on the market.

Their rise in the gaming hardware world has been meteoric, with the range of high-tech alternatives to default gamepads growing year-on-year.

Sony enters the playing field later this month with its Edge controller for the PlayStation 5 (PS5) - coming in at a whopping £210, which is a darn sight more than the already pricy standard pad at £60.

Gaming giant Razer's own new PS5 controller, the Wolverine V2 Pro, comes in at an even heftier $250 (£208).

So why would you want to spend quite so much?

Image: Sony's DualSense Edge controller for the PS5. Pic: Sony

Ali Homayounfar, lead designer on the Razer gamepad, explained that they are designed to give you an edge in those split-second situations.

He told Sky News: ""They're mainly used for shooting games - basically, you want to keep your thumbs on the thumbsticks at all times.

""Say you're getting shot at - if you take your thumb off the right stick, you won't be able to run left and right, and you'll be shot and killed.""

Taking your thumb off the right stick, traditionally used to turn a character's view and adjust aim, to press the jump or reload button, can cause the player to lose mobility and be vulnerable to enemies.

In a bid to alleviate the issue, pro controllers have adopted paddles on the back, allowing the player to keep their thumbs on the joysticks while simultaneously performing other actions.

The Wolverine V2 Pro also breaks tradition with the design of its joystick placement - a first for a PlayStation pad, bringing it in line with the offset layout of Microsoft's Xbox.

""We did a lot of studies and some PlayStation and pro players prefer the offset sticks,"" Mr Homayounfar said.

The developers at Razer were ""surprised and very happy"" that Sony approved the deviation.

""Every other PlayStation controller out there is going to have the thumbsticks in the centre,"" Mr Homayounfar said.

""So it's a nice differentiation for us, too. We're the only version of that.""

Razer and Sony's pro pads follow in the footsteps of Microsoft's Elite controller for the Xbox.

The company's flagship gamepad is incredibly customisable, allowing players to adjust the resistance of triggers, replace sticks, and remap buttons.

Microsoft also broke new ground back in 2018 with its adaptive controller, designed to meet the needs of gamers with limited accessibility, and Sony announced its own at CES this week.

Even the Nintendo Switch has had the pro treatment, including the recent release of the 8BitDo Ultimate Controller, which boasts many of the features of similar pads for the Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

It comes as Nintendo faces continued scrutiny over the performance of its own Joy-Con controllers, which are notorious for ""drifting"" - when the console registers movement even though the joysticks are not in use.

Nintendo is repairing faulty controllers free of charge, but it's an issue that has persisted even after the release of the premium Switch OLED console.

That means the market is rife for an all-singing-all-dancing gamepad that fixes the factory faults.

But while Joy-Con replacements may be free, it is clear that pro controllers do not come cheap.

As gamers take step to save money during the cost of living crisis, is the market sustainable?

""The demand's still there, for sure,"" said Mr Homayounfar.

""People are still excited for gaming and are still willing to spend the money for it.

""It's a fun investment, it's a passion for a lot of people.""

In an open letter to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, groups including Age UK, Scope and National Energy Action (NEA) have warned that the withdrawal of universal energy support from April ""will leave many older and disabled people in increasingly desperate situations"".

The letter demands support for individuals on means-tested benefits, disability benefits those receiving carer's allowance.

The NEA estimates the energy crisis has pushed more than 6.7 million British homes into energy poverty - and believes that the number will only rise to 8.4 million households come April.

Adam Scorer, chief executive of the NEA, has told Sky News that things are about to go from ""bad"" to ""worse"".

He said: ""In April what's going to happen is the support that the government's been giving everybody, but particularly vulnerable households will end.

""At the same time energy prices will jump by about 40% because the government will change the structure of the energy price guarantee and the price cap will go up.

""So we have this situation where in April a bad situation is going to get a whole lot worse.""

100;When bread becomes deadly - paying the allergy premium in a cost of living crisis;Saturday 21 January 2023 01:41, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];['cost of living'];['costs', 'price', 'premium', 'living', 'weekly', 'deadly', 'bread', 'glutenfree', 'food', 'allergy', 'allergies', 'cost', 'crisis', 'paying'];"For most people, the type of bread they buy is rarely a matter of life and death.

But for millions of Britons living with allergies eating the wrong food could see them hospitalised - or worse.

Amid the rising cost of living - and spiralling food prices that mean customers are left with little change from a fiver for a mere loaf of specialist bread - it is these families facing particular pressure.

Cost of living latest: What does inflation falling mean for interest rates?

The Bolton family, from Southampton, faces a double whammy of food restrictions.

Eli, aged 14, is allergic to dairy and soya while his older sister, Darshi, aged 17, has coeliac disease - which means a single crumb of gluten can leave her feeling like ""all her internal organs are being squeezed"".

This means the family cannot eat something as simple as the same loaf of bread.

A comparison of foods by Allergy UK in December found it costs on average 157% more for some free-from alternatives.

Bread had one of the sharpest price differences, with the allergy alternative up to 254% more costly.

""All gluten-free bread normally has egg or soya in it,"" said mum Lisa. ""So I have to buy two loaves.

""We have to have different milk, we have to have separate butter - my daughter has to have her own butter because the smallest grain of bread will make her so ill, so she can't even use the same knife.""

And getting it wrong can quickly turn deadly.

""My son has anaphylaxis so he could potentially die if he ingested dairy or soya,"" said Lisa, adding that they are ""generally not taken seriously, and that breaks my heart"".

Image: The Bolton family

Families spend an extra 40 days a year dealing with allergies

All of this specialist food comes at a cost.

The Food Standards Agency found food hypersensitivity households - those living with a food allergy, intolerance and coeliac disease - spend an additional 12 to 27% more on their weekly food shop.

They also spend an additional 40.37 days per year on activities related to food, including researching, shopping for suitable items and discussing their condition.

For Lisa, there is no such thing as a single weekly shop.

""I have to go to at least three on a weekly basis,"" she told Sky News.

When her son was first diagnosed she said she ""could have cried every time"" she stepped into a supermarket.

The number of products that listed food as ""may contain"" was ""soul-destroying"", she said.

While some people living with allergies may be able to eat food that is made in the same factory - and labelled ""may contain"" - for those with more severe reactions, this is not possible.

Around 2.6 million people in the UK live with a diagnosed food allergy, affecting between five and seven percent of children.

From pre-baking birthday cake and freezing it so her four-year-old daughter isn't left out, to providing her own sweets at the end of term, Rebecca Bull is always on alert to the risk of allergies.

""I think of every scenario where food might crop up, but occasionally you miss something.

""I've been at a party where an entertainer just threw sweets out to the kids, I hadn't anticipated that.

""And when you do that to a four-year-old, the temptation is massive. She just grabbed one and I had to jump up straight away.""

Why it is more expensive

""When manufacturers and brands swap out ingredients, the allergen-friendly option will often be more expensive,"" said Bari Stricoff, a registered dietitian.

""This is due to the increased difficulty in sourcing the ingredients, as well as the demand.

""Your average gluten-free flour will be nearly double the price as the standard flour, and almond flour could be 3x as high as the standard plain flour.

""Many allergen-friendly foods are produced by speciality brands.

""Because these are often smaller or newer brands, it means their costs are higher. They're not able to produce their items at scale and struggle to get into the larger retailers. This means they’ll have higher price tags to cover their margins.""

Knives, forks, and extra dishwashing

Hand-in-hand with the need to buy different food for each child comes a hidden energy cost.

""We have the cost of cooking most things twice,"" she said.

""If we cook pizza, we have to do them in two separate ovens.

""If we are making sandwiches to go out, we have to use about five different knives because you have to use a different knife for each person.""

Alongside that comes the extra fuel cost for the multiple supermarket visits.

Shopping with allergies - how to keep costs down Bari Stricoff, a registered dietitian who works at WellEasy – an online platform aimed at making specialist diets easier – advises buying in bulk and cooking from scratch to keep costs down.

'We don't have a choice': Food on prescription

In England, some gluten-free bread and flour mixes are available on prescription, although this can be a postcode lottery.

While Darshi does qualify, Lisa said: ""When you go to the chemist you have to order in batches of 20 loaves, so it's not practical to do that.

""And then when you order stuff they can't tell you when it's coming in.""

There is currently no similar programme for those living with food allergies.

""I think it should be anybody who has food restrictions,"" said Lisa.

""I understand that it's more expensive for manufacturers to make. So they should have some help in bringing it into line with everybody else.

""Because it's not a choice. We don't have any choice.""

52 fewer bagels: The allergy premium

Holly Holland, co-founder of Financelle - an online financial wellness platform, said she is ""new to the allergy and intolerance game"" and can't eat gluten or lactose.

""People don't realise how much stuff they are in,"" she told Sky News.

""Even if you pick up a pack of Doritos, lactose is used as a coating and powder. It's in cakes, it's in biscuits.

""And nine times out of 10 the package will just say 'may contain' anyway, so if you are battling a serious allergy, you can't even risk it.""

For Holly, bagels are a prime example of the allergy premium.

A pack of five from Asda costs her 95p, yet going gluten-free will set her back £2.50 for a pack of four. That's 63p a bagel compared to 19p.

""If I bought a pack of bagels each week for the rest of the year that's £130 compared to my gluten-eating friends forking out just £49.40,"" she said.

""And I would have 52 less bagels in 12 months.""

She said bread items are some of the most expensive because they are so ""heavily processed"".

The extra costs have forced Holly to be more creative with cooking.

""Arguably, it forces you to have any more fresh things because you can just pick up a packet of fish fingers or whatever it might be,"" she said.

But her weekly shop, which used to be around £40 for a family of four (with top-ups during the week) has now gone to £60.

Over the course of the year, this seemingly small amount adds up to £780 extra.

'It's not a good thing the gap has narrowed'

Sarah Knight from The Allergy Team - who also lives in an allergen household - said when the basics of your weekly shop remain so high, it's hard to keep costs down.

""Whether that's fortified dairy-free milk, whether that's gluten-free or wheat-free bread or dairy-free spread, when they are so high then makes it really hard to get the sort of overall price of your shop down.""

The organisation tracked the price of 10 of these basics at the four main supermarkets last year.

""At the beginning of last year the allergy stuff was going up disproportionately higher,"" she said.

""Now that other food has sort of caught up. It's not a good thing that the difference between an allergy basket and a non-allergy basket now is narrower because it is only because the non-allergy basket has also gone up.

Seva, a Kyiv resident and company executive turned military volunteer, is originally from the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro.

His sister was at her home in Dnipro on 14 January when a Russian ballistic missile targeted an apartment block nearby.

The attack left 45 people dead and injured dozens more when a section of the apartment block collapsed.

In the latest episode of the Sky News Ukraine War Diaries podcast, an emotional Seva reflects on the conversation he had with his sister in the aftermath of the attack that has left Ukraine reeling.

""Dnipro is my native city, and my sister lives about 300 metres from the place where the rocket hit the building,"" explains the 41-year old, who began recording diaries on his phone for Sky News shortly after the Russian invasion began.

“It was very difficult to talk to my sister as she [knows] some people who living in this building. Not exactly in the place where there was a rocket, but [in] the same building.

""She [had] to see, for the first time in her life, a lot of dead bodies. And, of course, it's very difficult [for her] to accept.”

To overcome existing Ukrainian air defence systems, Russia has begun to target the country with ballistic missiles.

For months, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pleaded with Western allies for more advanced weaponry that would help shoot down the missiles.

The US has agreed to supply the powerful Patriot air defence systems, which may help thwart such an attack. But it's yet to be implemented on the ground.

""[The attack on Dnipro] hit everyone really, really hard just because everyone can relate, because such buildings are very common all across Ukraine,"" explains Oksana Koshel, Seva’s wife, who also features in the latest episode.

""The pictures and the videos from the place, they just hit this very sensitive string in everybody's soul, because you understand that you [could] be next, and the people who you love, your family, [could] find themselves in a similar situation any day.""

102;Sports funding to cut crime - a drop in the ocean or a step in the right direction?;Saturday 21 January 2023 02:34, UK;['mhari aurora', '@mhariaurora'];['dominic raab'];['thrulife', 'funding', 'doing', 'crime', 'areas', 'ocean', 'deprived', 'children', 'raab', 'step', 'understand', 'right', 'drop', 'young', 'cut', 'tottenham', 'youth', 'direction'];"The government is giving £5m to 200 grassroots sports organisations in an effort to offer young people in deprived areas a constructive way to spend their spare time.

You may be forgiven for assuming this money was part of a Department of Culture, Media and Sport initiative, but it is in fact part of a push from the Ministry of Justice to prevent youth crime.

According to government figures, youth crime costs the UK taxpayer £1.5bn a year, and deputy prime minister and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab believes it's schemes like this that can make all the difference to children at risk of one day going down a dark path.

Politics hub: 'Hapless' Rishi Sunak's photo-op blew up in his face

""For those young people who might be at risk of getting drawn into antisocial behaviour or even worse, things like drugs and gangs, we give them - by supporting sports like boxing and football - a positive outlet"", he said.

However, Labour has consistently criticised the Conservatives for underfunding deprived urban areas - something the prime minister was slammed for last year when he told a crowd of Conservative members in Tunbridge Wells just that.

When I challenged Mr Raab on the cuts to youth centres in places like Tottenham under the Conservative government, he defended the government's fiscal choices: ""We've got to cut our coat according to our cloth.

""We've gone through this incredible financial challenge that the whole world has seen, but what we are doing and what you can see we're doing here is protecting and preserving investment in these kinds of schemes.""

Image: Dominic Raab said the scheme will give young people a 'positive outlet'

When I asked former footballer and ThruLife ambassador Jobi McAnuff whether he believed the government was putting enough funding into areas like his hometown of Tottenham, he replied: ""No is the short answer.""

He continued: ""This is very much our future and I think we should do as much as we can to put on these projects and facilities for children, and also to bang the drum and make some noise and hopefully the people in power will listen and understand how important the work is that is being done in these areas.""

Co-founder of ThruLife Michael Donaldson told me he didn't think the money was enough and explained that he wanted politicians to be more hands-on when it comes to helping communities like his.

""I'd love to see them actually spend, rather than five or 10 minutes, come down and be part of a programme, come and do a week with us. I know it's difficult but I'm yet to see anyone doing it and I don't understand why,"" he said.

Though this cash injection will be a welcome boost to grassroots sports clubs like ThruLife doing everything they can to prevent youth crime, they remain unconvinced that those in the Westminster bubble handing out the dosh understand what children in deprived areas are up against day-to-day.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230121024701/http://news.sky.com/story/sports-funding-to-cut-crime-a-drop-in-the-ocean-or-a-step-in-the-right-direction-12791530
103;"Patients should be charged for GP appointments and A&E; visits to ease waits, Sajid Javid says";Saturday 21 January 2023 02:31, UK;[];['nhs', 'sajid javid'];['conversation', 'appointments', 'fees', 'javid', 'visits', 'charged', 'tory', 'ae', 'sajid', 'secretary', 'patients', 'gp', 'rishi', 'ease', 'health', 'waits', 'nhs'];"Sajid Javid has said patients should be charged for GP appointments and A&E; visits, as he called the current model of the NHS ""unsustainable"".

Writing in an op-ed for The Times, the former health secretary said ""extending the contributory principle"" should be part of radical reforms to combat growing waiting times.

He also called for a ""grown-up, hard-headed conversation"" about revamping the health service, noting that ""too often the appreciation for the NHS has become a religious fervour and a barrier to reform"".

Downing Street said the prime minister is not ""currently"" considering the proposals.

Politics hub: 'Hapless' Rishi Sunak's photo-op blew up in his face

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had previously set out plans to fine patients who missed their GP and hospital appointments £10 as he was campaigning for the Tory leadership.

But he scrapped the idea following widespread criticism by health leaders.

Mr Javid proposed that the NHS should replace making people wait with means-tested fees, while ""protecting those on low incomes"".

""We should look, on a cross-party basis, at extending the contributory principle,"" he wrote.

""This conversation will not be easy, but it can help the NHS ration its finite supply more effectively.""

The Bromsgrove MP, who will not stand at the next election, highlighted Ireland's ""nominal"" 75 euro (£66) fees for going to an injury unit without a referral, and £20 fees for GP appointments in Norway and Sweden as possible models.

""Too often the appreciation for the NHS has become a religious fervour and a barrier to reform,"" the Bromsgrove MP also said.

""We need to shake off the constraints of political discourse and start having a grown-up, hard-headed conversation about alternatives.""

Mr Javid argued in the piece that ""the 75-year-old model of the NHS is unsustainable"".

His proposal comes amid increased calls for an overhaul of the NHS, and not just from within the Tory party.

Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told The Guardian: ""Reform is not a Conservative word.

""In recent elections, the left has given a lot of people the impression the answer to everything is to pour more money in. Of course investment is needed in the NHS, but ask any patient about their miserable experiences and it's partly about culture and systems. That's got to change too.""

104;'A recipe for disaster': The Power Slap League - and why neurologists are so concerned;Saturday 21 January 2023 01:31, UK;[];['ufc'];['disaster', 'brain', 'slap', 'concerned', 'recipe', 'told', 'power', 'potential', 'league', 'neurologists', 'white', 'video', 'sport', 'evangelou', 'head'];"Neurologists and sports stars have condemned a new competition in which participants are seen taking turns to slap each other as hard as they can.

Power Slap: Road To The Title, launched by UFC president Dana White, has faced scrutiny following its launch this week.

The TV show, which premiered on Wednesday 18 January, will feature eight episodes that its creators say are unscripted.

It highlights competitors from across the globe who battle it out on stage to demonstrate they have the most powerful slap.

Neurologist Chris Nowinski, a former wrestler and CEO of Concussion Legacy Foundation, said the show was ""pure exploitation"" and suggests one of the competitors shown in a video he shared on Twitter ""may never be the same"".

Tagging both White and the US television network broadcasting the show, TBS, Nowinski suggested they should be ""ashamed"" for creating and backing a sport that he said could put people at serious risk of brain injury.

""What's next, 'Who can survive a stabbing?'"" he added.

Sky News looks at what the series involves - and why experts have condemned it.

What is Power Slap and what are the rules?

In a two-minute-long preview video, White explains the rules of the competition, which has been licensed by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

""Before the match kicks off, a coin toss takes place to initiate the first slap,"" he says

""There are a maximum of three rounds in a fight. In each round, the fighter will deliver an open-hand slap to the opponent's face.""

At the start of the round the first ""striker"" has a time limit of 30 seconds to deliver an open-handed slap, below the eye but above the chin.

The striker cannot lead with the palm of the hand, and the whole hand must make contact at the same time.

After being slapped, the competitor has 30 seconds to recover and get back into the ""fight position"".

Judges use a 10-point-must system, like boxing, with the winner in a round scoring 10 points and the opponent scoring 9 or fewer.

Those receiving the slap are not allowed to flinch, raise their shoulder or tuck in their chin - rules that would appear to be behind claims they are effectively defenceless.

""It's the ultimate test of toughness,"" says White.

Why experts are concerned about the competition

Experts have warned that the event has the potential to cause significant and long-lasting physical harm to those taking part.

Consultant neurologist professor Nikos Evangelou at Nottingham University Hospital, told Sky News: ""One of the problems with Power Slap, is that the participants are penalised when they move or flinch.

""Any movement that might reduce the effect of the blow to the head is penalised.""

He said the ""impact to the head, from an angle, can cause rotational forces on the brain"" - which he says is a ""recipe for disaster"".

Prof Evangelou added: ""It's all a matter of time before we see more serious brain injury from a dissection.""

When asked what the long-term health implications of repeated trauma to the head may be, Prof Evangelou said it should be recognised that memory and other cognitive effects on the brain can have a lasting effect.

What are the risks?

Prof Evangelou described the force and potential danger may be the same as a punch.

""It's all a matter of physics,"" he told Sky News.

""The force applied to the face is the same force when one punches a face. The head/brain receives a blow and the brain is concussed causing hopefully a temporary, but sometimes permanent, disruption to brain function.

""Sadly because of the potential twisting movement of the head there could be even more serious complications.""

He says it's possible for death to occur following a single knock on the head if it causes one of the arteries that supply blood to the brain to split.

""Sadly, it is not that uncommon in clinical practice.""

Prof Evangelou says ""most of the time"" he would expect participants to simply be ""dazed"", but sometimes they can become less responsive, lose their balance, become confused or have a convulsion.

What people are saying on social media

A number of people have shared their thoughts on Twitter.

One user wrote: ""Whoever said airing this would be a good idea needs to get their head checked out. Unreal.""

Another added: ""This is beyond a doubt shameful. Not only for the organisation that produces it, but for the viewers who consume it. Why watch someone totally defenceless, being subjected to concussion forces without any protection.""

However, there are fans, too.

One tweeted: ""I don't particularly like it but these are grown people who know the risks.""

What the organisers say

Those behind the competition have been at pains to stress the measures they have taken to ensure competitors' safety.

In a recent interview, White responded to a question about the health of the fighters.

""We spend the money to make sure we have two healthy people in there, proper medical attention during and after the fight,"" he said.

""These are the things we need to educate people on, just like we needed to educate people on mixed martial arts.""

UFC chief business officer Hunter Campbell previously told ESPN the Power Slap league had been carefully tested and was based on a set of rules and structure based on mixed martial arts (MMA).

He also said the league would have similar medical requirements to MMA, such as weight classes and matchmaking.

""After testing it, it became clear to us that there's massive potential here as a sport, not unlike the early years of the UFC,"" he said.

""It made all the sense in the world to go toward regulation before the sport commencing, for all the obvious reasons - number one, the health and safety of the competitors.""

Tottenham's transfer chief Fabio Paratici has been handed a 30-month ban from Italian football for his involvement, after the club were accused of fixing their balance sheets.

Juventus deny any wrongdoing, saying the club's accounting was in line with industry standards.

The two-and-a-half-year ban for Juventus' former sporting director Mr Paratici, who is now managing director of football at Spurs, includes a request for an extension to cover UEFA and FIFA activities.

Sky Sports News has contacted Tottenham for comment in relation to the sanction handed out against Mr Paratici, but there is no suggestion he has done any wrongdoing while at Spurs.

Image: Fabio Paratici has been handed a 30-month ban from Italian football

The Italian national football federation's (FIGC) decision means Juventus will plunge from third to 10th place in the Serie A table, outside the spots for European competition.

Juventus indicated on Friday night that they are waiting for the written reasons behind the sanctions but will launch an appeal.

The court also ruled that former Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli is to be banned from holding office in Italian football for 24 months.

Former vice-president Pavel Nedved has been given an eight-month ban, while former chief executive Maurizio Arrivabene has also been hit with a ban.

Prosecutors had previously recommended a nine-point deduction over the scandal, in which the club were alleged to have falsely inflated the value of players and misrepresented losses.

The officials involved - including Mr Paratici - also intend to appeal the decision to CONI (Italian Olympic Committee).

CONI has the power to decide whether the decision is correct or not correct, and cannot reduce or change any of the sanctions.

The rulings come after the entire Juventus board, including Mr Agnelli, resigned in November.

The collective resignation came after Juventus' financial statements underwent scrutiny by prosecutors and Italian market regulator Consob last year for alleged false accounting and market manipulation.

Furthermore, Juve published an annual loss of £220m for last season - a record-breaking fee in the history of the club.

Lancashire Police issued the notice after the prime minister appeared without a belt in a clip on Instagram as he promoted his levelling-up funding in Lancashire.

Mr Sunak has accepted the fine, with Downing Street saying he ""fully accepts this was a mistake"" and will ""of course comply with the fixed penalty"".

Critics are now accusing the PM of showing ""the same disregard for rules"" as his Number 10 predecessor Boris Johnson.

Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted: ""Rishi Sunak is a total liability.""

Chris Bryant, Labour MP for Rhondda, said: ""Sunak promised honesty, integrity and accountability on the steps of Number 10. Not only has he been fined again for breaking the law, but Zahawi has been fined as well. It's time they all went. It's time for a general election.""

A Labour spokesperson added: ""Hapless Rishi Sunak's levelling-up photo op has blown up in his face and turned him into a laughing stock.

""He started the week hoping people would be grateful for a partial refund on the money that has been stripped from them over 13 years of the Tories. But instead he got a warring party and yet another fine from the police.""

'No one is above the law'

Labour MP Cat Smith thanked police for their road safety work before taking a swipe at Mr Sunak by saying ""no one is above the law"".

But Tory MP Scott Benton struck a different tone to his fellow Lancashire MP, saying the seatbelt complaint was politically motivated and bad use of police time.

In an apparent bid to downplay the significance of the notice, the Blackpool South MP tweeted: ""@LancsPolice do an amazing job, but I'm sure their time is better spent investigating serious crime which impacts on my constituents.

""The vast majority of people would think that politically motivated complaints about a seat belt are not good use of frontline resources.""

Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: ""Rishi Sunak has shown the same disregard for the rules as Boris Johnson, and now becomes the second ever prime minister to be fined by the police.

""From partygate to seatbelt gate, these Conservative politicians are just taking the British people for fools.

""Whilst they continue to behave as though it's one rule for them and another for everyone else, this fine is a reminder that the Conservatives eventually get their comeuppance.""

The criticism comes as Labour is also calling on Mr Sunak to dismiss Nadhim Zahawi from his cabinet after questions over the Tory chairman's tax affairs remain unanswered.

Questions have swirled following an article in The Sun on Sunday, which claimed a seven-figure payment was made by Mr Zahawi to end a dispute with the taxman ""after scrutiny of his family's financial affairs"".

Second serving PM to break the law while in office

Mr Sunak is the second serving prime minister - after Boris Johnson - to be found to have broken the law while in office.

The force said: ""You will be aware that a video has been circulating on social media showing an individual failing to wear a seatbelt while a passenger in a moving car in Lancashire.

""After looking into this matter, we have today issued a 42-year-old man from London with a conditional offer of fixed penalty.""

Mr Sunak has previously been fined by the Met Police for breaking lockdown rules.

He and Mr Johnson were fined by the Metropolitan Police over a birthday held in Downing Street for the former prime minister when curbs were in place.

Analysis: Sunak's slip-ups give enemies perfect chance to brand him out of touch

PM urged to sack Zahawi over tax claims

Sunak's slip-ups could be exploited by opponents to brand him out of touch Joe Pike Political correspondent @joepike Downing Street will be hoping that once the PM has paid up, voters and journalists will move on and forget this rather embarrassing unforced error. To Rishi Sunak’s credit, he put his hands up and admitted the error almost immediately. But it is a reminder that in the top job, with a permacrisis of strikes, NHS delays and high inflation, mistakes can slip through the Number 10 net. Failing to wear a seatbelt is illegal, but filming it and publishing the evidence on social media suggests a lack of checks within the PM's team. This is the second police fine Mr Sunak has received in 9 months, after the Met Police punished him for attending a lockdown-busting birthday gathering for Boris Johnson. In recent months Mr Sunak has struggled with contactless payments, had an awkward conversation with a homeless man about financial services, and demonstrated a fondness for using private jets to travel around the UK even for relatively short journeys. Added together, such slip-ups may be exploited by the PM's enemies to claim he is out of touch. There is certainly a danger these small missteps distract from Rishi Sunak’s attempts to stabilise the economy and sort out seemingly intractable issues like migrant crossings and delayed discharges. Like many occupants of Number 11, Rishi Sunak was a ‘submarine chancellor’. Invisible below the waves for months on end, he occasionally rose from the deep to launch a killer economic intervention: his “whatever it takes” COVID budget, the furlough scheme, Eat Out To Help Out. But as Gordon Brown (the last politician to move from 11 to 10) found, similar manoeuvres are not possible as prime minister. You are constantly in the spotlight. And it is an unsparing existence.

Law must be applied 'impartially'

Sky News' policing analyst Graham Wettone said he is ""not surprised"" about the notice, adding that it is the ""right and proper"" resolution.

""It is exactly what would happen to anybody else if they were to commit a similar offence and the police discovered it.""

Mr Wettone dismissed criticism that the prime minister has been treated unfairly, suggesting the case was ""fairly simple"" and that the law must be applied ""impartially"".

Fines of up to £500 can be issued for failing to wear a seatbelt when one is available.

There are a few exemptions, including when a car is being used for police, fire and rescue services, and for certified medical issues.

Mr Sunak came to office promising ""integrity"" after the scandals that eventually forced Mr Johnson from office.

Mr Sunak's premiership has been hit with a series of controversies since he entered Number 10 in October, from criticism for reinstating Suella Braverman as home secretary six days after she was forced to step down over a security breach to an ongoing bullying inquiry into Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230121050223/http://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-branded-total-liability-as-he-faces-backlash-from-mps-after-being-handed-second-police-fine-12791536

The company's chief executive wrote in 2018 that he had ""secured"" funding to take the electric carmaker private and later that investor backing was ""confirmed"", causing shares to soar and then fall.

Less than three weeks later, Musk backtracked on the plan.

Investors who bought or sold stock in the days after the tweets are seeking unspecified damages, but have claimed Musk's tweets cost them ""billions"".

The trial heard that Musk's social media admission led to a $40m (£32m) settlement with securities regulators, as well as a class-action lawsuit alleging he misled investors, and he was forced to step down as company chairman.

The 51-year-old billionaire, who has been running Twitter since he purchased the platform for $44bn in October, attended court for around half an hour on Friday to deliver sworn testimony before a nine-person jury and a room packed with reporters and other spectators.

The trial was then adjourned for the weekend, with Musk being told to return on Monday to answer more questions.

The judge, Edward Chen, previously denied a request by Musk to have the case moved to Texas, with the billionaire expressing concern that potential jurors in California would be biased against him.

In his initial address to the courtroom, the business mogul defended his prolific tweeting as ""the most democratic way"" to distribute information even while acknowledging Twitter's 240-character limit that can make it challenging to be as clear as possible.

The jury focused intently on the billionaire, who was wearing a dark suit and tie, as he answered questions by Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing Tesla shareholders.

'Level of pain... was excruciating'

When asked about the challenges that Tesla faced in 2018, he described spending many nights sleeping at the carmaker's California factory as he tried to keep the company afloat.

""The sheer level of pain to make Tesla successful during that 2017, 2018 period was excruciating,"" he told the court.

The trial over Musk's Tesla tweets comes at a time when he has been focusing on Twitter while also serving as the carmaker's CEO and also remaining deeply involved in SpaceX, the rocket ship company he founded.

His Twitter takeover has proven unpopular among Tesla's current stockholders, who are concerned he has been paying less attention to the carmaker at a time of intensifying competition - which contributed to a 65% decline in Tesla's stock last year that wiped out more than $700bn (£565bn) in shareholder wealth.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230121054732/http://news.sky.com/story/elon-musk-takes-witness-stand-to-defend-tesla-buyout-tweets-in-civil-court-case-12791549

The 65-year-old was reported missing by his wife a week ago after he failed to return home from a hike in the southern Californian mountains.

Due to evidence of avalanches, ground crews have not been able to continue their efforts, and the area is only being searched via helicopter for now.

Both national and state officials are working with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's office to help find Sands, but authorities have said there was still ""no time set"" for when ground searches will begin.

On Friday, the county sheriff's department revealed that pings from the actor's phone appeared to show he had been on the move, heading further into the Baldy Bowl area of the San Gabriel Mountains on the day he was reported missing.

""We are working with state and federal agencies that have cell phone forensics to assist us in pinpointing a location, but so far no new info has been developed,"" a spokesperson from the department said.

No date has been set for calling off operations yet, with the incident still being treated as a search and rescue operation.

Mount Baldy residents noted the ""extreme"" conditions in the area, which has been experiencing freezing temperatures and bad weather in recent days, but said they would not ""rule anything out"" in the mission to find Sands.

'With every step, danger increases'

San Bernardino County Fire Department captain Rodd Mascis said the search for missing hikers was ""sadly regular"" and could be like finding a ""needle in a haystack"".

""It truly is 'enter at your own risk',"" he added.

""Most people come equipped for the day... but coming up against the elements is very difficult after a couple of days.

""You've got to be careful, it's a beautiful area, but with every step that danger increases.""

The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department previously urged hikers to ""think twice and heed warnings"", saying its search and rescue teams had responded to 14 calls on Mount Baldy and in the surrounding area over the last four weeks.

Analysis by Mark Stone, US correspondent

As Sky News reports from the Russian town where the mercenary group Wagner trains its fighters (see 4.49pm post), in Washington - at the White House - officials have been revealing some remarkable statistics.

The White House's National Security Council Spokesman Admiral John Kirby told us tonight that around 50,000 Wagner Group fighters are currently deployed to Ukraine.

Basing his assessments on US intelligence reports, Kirby said that 10,000 of them are contractors but the other 40,000 are convicts.

""Greater than 90% of Wagner's casualties have been ex-convicts that they've plucked out of prison with no training and thrown into the fight,"" he said.

He also claimed that Wagner is becoming a rival power centre to the Russian ministry of defence. He built the picture of an increasing Russian power struggle.

The Americans also announced that Wagner has been designated a Transnational Criminal Organisation, a label which unlocks various mechanisms to disrupt its work.

A broader number of nations and institutions will now be more able to cut the money flow to Wagner.

It's a form of sanction, but as we know, sanctions have been distinctly incapable of stopping Russian aggression so far in this war.

As part of its case against Wagner, the Americans have released two satellite images as evidence that North Korea is supplying Russia with weapons.

Two released images show, say the Americans, Wagner-operated rolling stock at locations either side of the tiny, shared border between North Korea and Russia.

For some time the West has believed that North Korea, along with Iran, had been helping to replenish Russia's weapons stock.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230121093243/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-us-urges-zelenskyy-to-hold-off-on-major-offensive-as-number-of-convicts-fighting-for-russia-is-revealed-12541713

Police were also sent to the house but there were no reports of injuries.

Last year Vardy made headlines across the world when she lost to Coleen Rooney in the so-called Wagatha Christie libel trial.

Vardy unsuccessfully sued Rooney after she accused her of leaking ""false stories"" about her private life to the press.

In October a judge ruled that Vardy must pay 90% of Rooney's costs, which ran to more than £1.5m.

114;'Predators' could exploit gender self-identification, says minister Kemi Badenoch;Saturday 21 January 2023 09:25, UK;[];['kemi badenoch', 'scotland', 'transgender'];['trans', 'say', 'kemi', 'minister', 'badenoch', 'recognition', 'selfidentification', 'reform', 'gender', 'grc', 'able', 'uk', 'predators', 'exploit'];"""Predators"" could exploit gender self-identification, government minister Kemi Badenoch has said, as she voiced her opposition to proposed reforms.

The minister for women and equalities argued that offenders would be able to ""exploit any system that says you can just say you are what you are,"" putting women and girls at risk.

In an unprecedented move earlier this week, the UK government blocked legislation passed by the Scottish parliament to reform the gender recognition process.

It is the first time Westminster has used the power since devolution nearly 25 years ago.

The Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill was passed by a majority of MSPs last month, with Nicola Sturgeon hailing it as a ""historic day for equality"".

The bill would approve reforms allowing trans people to obtain a gender recognition certificate (GRC) without the need for a medical diagnosis.

Read more:

Why is Scotland's gender recognition reform bill controversial?

The age someone can legally change their gender in Scotland would also be lowered to 16 from 18, and someone would only have to live in their acquired gender for three months - reduced from two years.

Ms Badenoch made her comments in an interview with The Times, highlighting what she sees as the risks of self-identification.

She told the newspaper: ""We have no problem with that in the sense that we want people who are trans to be able to live their lives freely and as they wish.

""The problem is that self-identification also makes life a lot easier for other people we don't want to have those sorts of freedoms.

""Predators would be able to exploit any system that says you can just say you are what you are.

""It's also quite bad for trans people. They then get conflated and associated with the predators and people who are looking to do bad things.

""That's why having a stricter regime rather than a loose regime is quite important.""

Ms Badenoch also hit out at the highly-charged emotions around the issue.

""Rather than having a disagreement on whether you think self-identification is okay or not okay, people who have a different view are then abused, insulted, called transphobic,"" she added.

""That's what has really toxified the debate and made a lot of people scared to say what they think.""

Earlier this month, Ms Badenoch announced that the government would be updating the list of countries from which the UK will accept gender recognition certificates.

Currently, people who have already had their gender recognised in 41 overseas countries and territories can apply for a GRC in the UK through a simplified process.

Ms Badenoch said nations which no longer have ""equivalently rigorous"" systems to the UK will be removed from the list, meaning people from there would have to apply for a UK GRC through the main route.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230121100222/http://news.sky.com/story/predators-could-exploit-gender-self-identification-says-minister-kemi-badenoch-12791589

Facing volleys of tear gas, demonstrators took over key roads in downtown Lima and became locked in running battles with officers.

Some protesters were seen throwing water bottles filled with rocks at police, while others were spotted waving flags and heard chanting: ""The spilled blood will never be forgotten"".

Demonstrations have engulfed large portions of the country following the impeachment and imprisonment of Pedro Castillo, Peru's first leader from a rural Andean background, after he tried to dissolve Congress last month.

The country's former vice president Dina Boluarte was sworn in as leader, but since then protesters have held demonstrations, calling for early elections and for Mr Castillo to be released.

While the protests have been causing waves for several weeks, they have mainly been concentrated in the southern region of the country, with a total of 55 people killed and 700 injured in the unrest.

However, they've now started spilling into the capital, with objectors trying to make Lima the focal point of the action.

On Friday, many of the protesters in Lima arrived from remote Andean regions, with one person saying he travelled for 20 hours from the southern Puno region, which has been the site of the deadliest state violence for the past month.

Jose Luis Ayma Cuentas, 29, said: ""We're staying until she resigns, until the dissolution of Congress, until there are new elections, otherwise we aren't going anywhere.""

Anger at the police was a constant throughout the march, with demonstrators yelling ""murderers"" as they passed rows of officers wearing helmets and holding up shields.

Protests and clashes with police also took place in other parts of the country on the same day.

In Arequipa, Peru's second city, officers clashed with protesters who tried to storm the airport.

Also in southern Peru, multinational firm Glencore decided to temporarily shut down its Antapaccay copper mine after protesters attacked the site.

In the evening, interior minister Vicente Romero praised police action during the protests, saying that it was ""very professional"".

'You want to generate chaos'

The demonstrations followed a defiant speech by Ms Boluarte on Thursday night, in which she accused protesters of fomenting violence and vowed to prosecute them.

""You want to break the rule of law, you want to generate chaos so that within that chaos and confusion you take power,"" she said.

Ms Boluarte has said she supports a plan to hold fresh elections in 2024, two years ahead of schedule, but protesters says that is not fast enough.

As well as calling for Ms Boularte's resignation, protesters are also demanding the closure of Congress and changes to the constitution.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230121104712/https://news.sky.com/story/peru-protests-thousands-of-anti-government-demonstrators-clash-with-police-in-lima-for-second-day-12791574
116;Ukraine war: Russian mercenary Wagner Group suffers heavy losses as their boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, steps firmly into the spotlight;Friday 20 January 2023 20:48, UK;['diana magnay', '@dimagnaysky'];['russia', 'ukraine'];['men', 'steps', 'mercenary', 'kremlin', 'prigozhin', 'russia', 'yevgeny', 'ukraine', 'suffers', 'sledgehammer', 'wagner', 'russias', 'spotlight', 'fighters', 'russian', 'war', 'group'];"The graves are all fresh. Row after row of them, almost identical. The same mound of sandy soil, the same black, red and yellow wreath mounted with a golden star.

The same wooden, orthodox cross to mark the grave, though there are some Muslim headstones too. Just the names and the dates on a small bronze plaque to distinguish the lives extinguished. None of them lived to a ripe old age.

This is a cemetery for Wagner mercenaries near Krasnodar in southern Russia. Krasnodar region is the Wagner Group's heartland. Their training ground is nearby in a village called Molkino.

There is a newly built chapel not far away which houses the urns of cremated fighters. And there is space available for still more graves in this cemetery, when the next wave of bodies come home.

Wagner is heavily involved in Russia's offensive around Bakhmut and Soledar in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region. Its fighters have died, Ukraine says, in their thousands.

Most likely the bulk of those were convicts, sent in to die like cannon fodder and be buried in a Wagner cemetery far from home. Perhaps after time in Russia's penal colonies they no longer had homes to speak of.

""The area near Soledar is covered with corpses of the invaders… This is what madness looks like,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, said in one of his nightly addresses.

Image: The rows of graves of Wagner fighters are almost identical

Russia claims to be in control of Soledar, a victory that Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, declares as his own.

In the past few days he has also claimed to be behind the capture of the village of Klishchiivka about nine kilometres south of Bakhmut, though that has yet to be confirmed from the Ukrainian side. The Russian defence ministry has been less gracious about Wagner's role but it has conceded that they played a role in capturing Soledar.

There are rumours, dismissed by the Kremlin as media speculation, that army boss Valery Gerasimov was brought in to replace Sergey Surovikin as head of Ukraine operations partly to keep Prigozhin in line.

Putting the top military commander in charge of Russia's ""special military operation"" could be interpreted as a way of reinforcing army hierarchy and reminding Prigozhin and his band of mercenaries who is ultimately in charge.

Prigozhin, who only a few months ago refused to confirm the well-known secret that he ran the Wagner Group and sued anyone who suggested otherwise, has come out in public all guns blazing. There is no longer a need for the ""regime of silence"", he said.

Image: Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin inspects body bags. Pic: Fan Media Agency

There are videos of him now in the salt mines around Bakhmut, where US officials believe he has an eye on the mineral spoils.

There are videos of him handing out medals to his fighters. There are videos of him surveying piles of body bags behind the frontlines and attending funerals back home. He has not shied away from his losses, demanding the same burial rights for his men as for regular army soldiers.

He has shown himself willing to be a presence at the frontlines, quite the battleground commander, which is more than can be said for the ultimate commander-in-chief who, unlike Ukraine's president, has paid no visits to the front.

Prigozhin's PR team provide quick responses, purportedly from the man himself, to media questions. In a recent salvo, he takes aim at Kremlin bureaucrats who he says are longing for Russia to lose the war and for the US to start calling the shots in Russia. But the US ""won't take you in"", he writes to these supposed Kremlin traitors. ""And then you will come to us, where the Wagner sledgehammer will be waiting for you.""

Image: It is getting harder for the Wagner Group to recruit fighters after heavy losses

The sledgehammer is no idle threat. In November, video appeared purporting to show a Wagner mercenary bludgeoned to death with a sledgehammer for defecting to Ukraine. When asked to comment, Prigozhin replied, ""a dog receives a dog's death"".

Later that month, a bloodied sledgehammer in a violin case was presented to the European Parliament as they debated declaring Russia a terrorist state, a sinister message from the group also known in Russia as ""The musicians"".

But losing that many men creates problems and the recruitment drive in Russia's prisons is reportedly drying up.

Paul Whelan, a US citizen (who also holds British citizenship) and was jailed in 2018 on espionage charges, told his brother David that Wagner recruiters had little luck the last time they came round his prison colony. ""Everyone else has a clear picture of what happens to prisoners who go to fight the Kremlin's war in Ukraine"", David Whelan wrote in his regular email updates. This time round, they reportedly managed to sign up just eight men, compared with 115 on the previous occasion.

Prigozhin is a powerful man. He is unashamedly critical of both Russia's senior military command and of the Kremlin elites though he does not say a bad word about Vladimir Putin.

Wagner has played a key role for years already as an unofficial arm of Russian foreign policy in Syria, Libya and other African countries.

Now in Ukraine, the group is out in the open. But Ukraine is a far bloodier battlefield and the fight more existential, both for the Wagner Group and for Putin's Russia, which has enabled men like Prigozhin, with his brutal, sledgehammer tradecraft, to flourish.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230121110212/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-russian-mercenary-wagner-group-suffers-heavy-losses-as-their-boss-yevgeny-prigozhin-steps-firmly-into-the-spotlight-12790830

They were lucky, most of their home was saved but nine neighbouring cottages were destroyed and 10 others in the village of Wennington.

""There was anger. There was heartbreak. The tension on the day was unbelievable.

""We were watching the fire creep along the cottages and then the smoke started coming out of our roof and we said: 'It's gone'.

It is six months since Britain's hottest ever day - when the temperature hit 40C and wildfires sparked across England.

Four homes were lost in Barnsley and 41 across the Greater London area.

Families lost everything

Wennington in Essex was the worst hit. In scenes more familiar from the likes of Portugal or California, a wildfire leapt between gardens, fields, and homes driven by a swirling wind. Almost anything was fuel.

Today the high street resembles a set of teeth with gaps. Terraced homes erased by flames and resulting demolition. As we are there, steel-jawed cranes pick through the rubble separating garden gnomes from blackened bed springs.

A few steps along the main street, Sophie Woods has come back to see her former home for the last time.

""It's being demolished today,"" she says. ""I feel devastated. You just never think in a million years that something like that could happen... that day was absolutely awful.

""We lost everything.""

Would the UK be any better protected if such weather returned this year?

'This could happen again'

Wennington resident Dave wants rules on firebreaks that would compel landowners to remove flammable vegetation close to buildings.

The Forestry Commission now has accredited ""vegetation fire training"" and the local station commander, Graham Beers, says his officers are now offering advice on preventing your back garden from becoming an accidental tinder box.

He said: ""This would include information about keeping your hedges trimmed down, taking away any fire loading items in your garden you don't need... old gas cylinders and even safe use of BBQs.""

But the Climate Change Committee - the independent body which advises on averting climate change and, crucially, how to respond to it - has criticised the government for lacking preparedness for a more hostile climate.

""One is reducing emissions... the other is adaptation and I'm afraid governments across the UK are just not stepping up to that.

Pressure has been mounting on Mr Zahawi to respond to questions over his tax affairs, however up to now he had refused to comment.

The Guardian first reported that he paid a 30% penalty, taking the estimated total tax bill to more than £4.8 million.

Ahead of his statement, Labour had renewed calls for the Prime Minister to take action, and sack Mr Zahawi.

Speaking at the Fabian Society conference, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""A few months ago ... he was chancellor of the Exchequer and responsible for Britain's tax affairs and tax collection, and we now find that he wasn't so keen to pay himself.

""So, if the Prime Minister wants to stick by his commitment for integrity, honesty and professionalism, he should do the right thing and sack Nadhim Zahawi.""

The Drina River in Visegrad in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina has been left crammed with rubbish following wet weather.

Waste from poorly regulated riverside landfills has accumulated behind a barrier in the river, leaving a vast carpet of pollution which stretches across the width of the water.

Image: Part of a refrigerator floats among the waste

Rusty barrels, household appliances, driftwood and other rubbish picked up by the river from its tributaries have all been trapped by fencing installed by a Bosnian hydroelectric plant, a few kilometres upstream from its dam.

Environmental activists say the resulting blockage has turned the town into an unofficial regional waste site.

Heavy rain and unseasonably warm weather over the past week have caused many rivers and streams in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro to overflow, flooding the surrounding areas and forcing scores of people from their homes.

Image: This is how the Drina River has looked in the past

'Huge inflow of garbage'

Temperatures dropped in many areas on Friday as rain turned into snow.

This is not the first time the area has become full of rubbish, with the same situation occurring in 2021, endangering the local ecosystem and people's health.

Dejan Furtula, of the environmental group Eko Centar Visegrad, said: ""We had a lot of rainfall and torrential floods in recent days and a huge inflow of water from [the Drina's tributaries in] Montenegro which is now, fortunately, subsiding.

""Unfortunately, the huge inflow of garbage has not ceased.""

Image: Waste has been trapped by the river fencing

The Drina River - which has an intense green colour due to the limestone terrain and is often enjoyed by rafters - runs 346km (215 miles) from the mountains of north western Montenegro through Serbia and Bosnia.

Around 10,000 cubic meters (more than 353,000 cubic feet) of waste are estimated to have collected behind the barrier in recent days. The same amount was pulled in recent years from that area of the river.

Health hazard

Removing the waste could take up to six months and will end up as landfill.

Mr Furtula said the local waste site ""does not even have sufficient capacity to handle [the city's] municipal waste. The fires on the landfill site are always burning.""

He called the conditions there ""not just a huge environmental and health hazard, but also a big embarrassment for all of us.""

Three-and-a-half years of brutal warfare in the 1990s, which left 100,000 dead, has left the Balkans lagging behind Europe both economically and environmentally.

Despite seeking membership in the European Union and adopting some of the EU's laws and regulations, the countries of the region have made little progress in building effective, environmentally sound waste disposal systems.

In addition to river pollution, many countries in the western Balkans are facing extremely high level of air pollution, with some towns among the most polluted on the planet.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230121140207/http://news.sky.com/story/balkan-river-known-for-its-breath-taking-scenery-becomes-floating-rubbish-dump-12791685

The British player lost in four sets 6-1 6-7 (7) 6-3 6-4 to Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut.

Murray won just one of the first 15 points before getting on the board in the fourth game, before Bautista Agut wrapped up the opening set in only 29 minutes.

The defeat came after Murray's marathon second round match against Australia's Thanasi Kokkinakis - which lasted five hours and 45 minutes, finishing at 4am.

Coupled with a near five-hour first-round win over Matteo Berrettini, the Scot had spent 10 hours and 34 minutes on court just making it through to the last 32.

To begin with it appeared he would offer little resistance against Bautista Agut but he hung on for another three hours and 29 minutes before his Spanish opponent served out the match.

Murray was seen limping off the court as he made his way back to the changing rooms after the game.

The contest also came four years after he revealed the extent of his hip pain and that he was considering retiring ahead of a first-round clash against the Spaniard.

'I played very good tennis'

Speaking after his victory, Bautista Agut said: ""Always playing Andy in a grand slam is very tough. He knows the game very well and knows how to play a grand slam match.

""I'm very happy with how I managed all the nerves and all the tension during all the match. I played very good tennis and I'm very happy I got the win.""

Coupled with a loss for Dan Evans to Andrey Rublev earlier, that is now the end of the British challenge in singles for another year at Melbourne Park.

His authority clears a path through the crowds as he guides us with a brisk stride. His staff stand a little straighter when he walks past.

""I visit the station once a day. Some days, more than once. I think boots on the ground is the best approach during the war,"" says the 39-year-old railway chief.

The landmark station has the austere brutalist facade of a Soviet-era building. But the inside is far from grey.

""It's important to boost morale,"" says Oleksandr, proudly pointing out the new features.

""Do you hear that? Music,"" he adds.

Instead of a steady stream of shouty train announcements, the platforms where thousands of evacuated Ukrainian women and children passed through now permeate with the sound of pop tunes.

Ukraine's railway system has evacuated four million people since the start of the war. Its 27,000 km of track stretches across the country and has been a critical lifeline - transporting emergency supplies and aid, as well as people.

Oleksander was appointed CEO of Ukrainian Railways only six months before the Russian invasion in February. Since then, his job has been to manage the network and maintain its functionality while under the threat of targeted attacks.

In April, a Russian missile fired into the eastern station of Kramatorsk killed 60 people and wounded more than 110. It is still one of the deadliest air strikes in the war so far. The missile left on the grounds of the station was emblazoned with a dark message - ""for the children"".

The software - which Rentokil began developing 18 months ago alongside Vodafone - tracks rodents' habits to help decide how to kill them.

Following laboratory trials, which helped the software learn about the creatures, it has now been used in real-life settings.

Rentokil says rodents are thought to be responsible for more deaths than all the wars over the last 1,000 years.

Andy Ransom, chief executive, told the Financial Times: ""With facial recognition technology you can see that rat number one behaved differently from rat number three.

""And the technology will always identify which rat has come back, where are they feeding, where are they sleeping, who's causing the damage, which part of the building are they coming from, where are they getting into the building from, whether it's the same rodent that caused the problem last week.""

To develop the technology, Rentokil observed the rats in a controlled setting, with cameras monitoring behaviour and feeding this into the AI system.

This used machine learning to build the recognition capabilities.

It has since moved on to pilot programmes in customer's houses to test the technology, and while it remains at early stages, the company hopes it will make pest control more effective and efficient.

Rachel Reeves told the Fabian Society conference it is a ""scandal"" that those with the least are forced to pay the most for their energy.

""Labour would eliminate the premium paid by those on pre-payments metres,"" she said.

""And the forced installation of pre-payment meters all too often leads to the most vulnerable households going without heating entirely, so Labour is calling for a moratorium on that practice.""

She said the opposition's plans to keep the price cap at its current level of £2,500 would ""save the typical household £500 on their energy bills from April, compared to the government's plans"".

She said her party's plans would ""prevent tomorrow's crises"" with its long-term strategy.

'A 13-year Tory experiment'

Ms Reeves hit back at Tory claims that the war in Ukraine was responsible for the energy crisis.

""The effects of Putin's war have reverberated around the world, and we will not waver in our support for Ukraine,"" she told the conference.

""But it wasn't Russia's invasion of Ukraine that caused home insulation rates to collapse. It wasn't Russia's invasion of Ukraine that caused a decade of inaction on nuclear and renewable energy.

""And it wasn't Russia's invasion of Ukraine that closed our gas storage facilities here in Britain. Those are the consequences of a thirteen-year Tory experiment, in unilateral energy disarmament.

""And we are all paying the price.""

She went on to reject the ""ideological cul-de-sacs"" of those who believe there is a choice between going green and going for growth.

PM mocked over missing seatbelt

In her speech, Ms Reeves also mocked Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for using a jet for domestic trips and getting fined for failing to wear a seatbelt.

Lancashire Police issued a fixed penalty notice after the prime minister appeared without a belt in a clip on Instagram as he promoted his levelling-up funding in Lancashire.

It is the second time he has been fined while a member of the government and Mr Sunak is now the second serving prime minister - after Boris Johnson - to be found to have broken the law while in office.

""The prime minister has made clear his own depth of commitment to net zero this week when he chose to fly from Teesside to Blackpool on an RAF jet,"" she said.

""Now I understand that the air stewards had to do the seatbelt demonstration several times before the Prime Minister finally got it.""

But questions about his financial affairs are now front and centre, having first gained prominence during the Stratford-on-Avon MP's short-lived campaign to become prime minister last summer.

The allegations centre on his links to a Gibraltar-based trust 'Balshore Investments Limited', of which his father Hareth Zahawi is a director.

Politics latest: 'Hapless' Rishi Sunak's photo-op blew up in his face

When Nadhim Zahawi co-founded the polling firm YouGov in May 2000, the trust was allocated shares in the company equalling the number given to the other co-founder Stephan Shakespeare.

Asked about this by Kay Burley last year, the then chancellor said neither he nor his wife benefit from the Gibraltar trust and denied it was used to avoid tax, saying it was simply because his father ""lived abroad"".

The cabinet minister has also suggested the trust held the shares because his father was involved in setting up the company, had put money into it and had provided guidance.

Those working at YouGov at the time said Hareth Zahawi was helpful, albeit in an informal way, while others at the firm said he was not involved beyond being a shareholder.

Evidence from 2005 also appears to show - at that point, before he became an MP - Nadhim Zahawi was benefitting from this offshore trust.

A financial document published by YouGov sets out that a dividend payment that was due to go to Balshore instead was used to pay off loans owed by Mr Zahawi.

Potential tax saving uncovered

Much of this detail was first uncovered by Dan Neidle - a lawyer who used to work for a top corporate and now runs a not-for-profit focussed on tax policy.

Tory sources have briefed that Mr Neidle - who is a Labour member - is a ""Labour activist"" and the allegations are merely taken from his ""blog"".

This comes after lawyers acting for Mr Zahawi sent Mr Neidle a series of letters last year threatening legal action if he continued to publish analysis of the Tory MP's financial affairs.

After digging through pages of documents, Mr Neidle had suggested there would have been a potential tax saving of several million pounds when Balshore sold its YouGov shares.

That's because they were held in an offshore trust rather than by Mr Zahawi directly, and hence not eligible for capital gains tax.

It's this figure that is at the centre of the repayment to HMRC.

On Friday, the Guardian newspaper suggested Mr Zahawi reached a settlement with the exchequer that reflected the fact he should have paid tax on the sale of these shares at the time.

""So that I could focus on my life as a public servant, I chose to settle the matter and pay what they said was due, which was the right thing to do. ""Additionally, HMRC agreed with my accountants that I have never set up an offshore structure, including Balshore Investments, and that I am not the beneficiary of Balshore Investments. This matter was resolved prior to my appointments as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and subsequently chairman of the party I love so much. When I was appointed by the prime minister, all my tax affairs were up to date.""

Tax affairs up to date

Mr Zahawi has now confirmed that tax was repaid saying that HMRC had concluded his father was not entitled to the share allocation handed to him when YouGov was created.

The Tory chairman said this was a ""careless and not a deliberate error"" and didn't confirm if any penalty was also levied.

He also re-stated that he was not a beneficiary of Balshore Investments and had never set up an offshore structure.

However, this intervention clashes somewhat with previous assertions that his tax affairs ""were and are fully up to date"".

The yellow weather warning for fog on Sunday covers much of England, including Yorkshire, the South East and the Midlands.

Visibility could dip as low as 50m and forecasters say untreated surfaces may become slippery, leading to an increased chance of accidents or injuries.

Drivers are being warned to expect probable slower travel times, with delays to bus and train services also possible.

There is a chance of delays or cancellations to flights, the Met Office said.

""Freezing fog will lead to difficult driving conditions and could cause travel delays in some areas on Saturday night and Sunday morning,"" it added.

A level three cold alert remains in place for England until Wednesday.

Sky News weather presenter Jo Edwards said: ""Dense freezing fog is likely to become a serious issue over the next few days as high pressure drifting across southern parts of the country prevents milder conditions becoming dominant.

""Overnight temperatures for the Midlands, East Anglia, and the South East are likely to fall as low as -6C so there will likely be the combined threat of fog and ice.""

The Drina River in Visegrad in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina has been left crammed with rubbish following wet weather.

Waste from poorly regulated riverside landfills has accumulated behind a barrier in the river, leaving a vast carpet of pollution which stretches across the width of the water.

Rusty barrels, household appliances, driftwood and other rubbish picked up by the river from its tributaries have all been trapped by fencing installed by a Bosnian hydroelectric plant, a few kilometres upstream from its dam.

Environmental activists say the resulting blockage has turned the town into an unofficial regional waste site.

Heavy rain and unseasonably warm weather over the past week have caused many rivers and streams in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro to overflow, flooding the surrounding areas and forcing scores of people from their homes.

'Huge inflow of garbage'

Temperatures dropped in many areas on Friday as rain turned into snow.

This is not the first time the area has become full of rubbish, with the same situation occurring in 2021, endangering the local ecosystem and people's health.

Dejan Furtula, of the environmental group Eko Centar Visegrad, said: ""We had a lot of rainfall and torrential floods in recent days and a huge inflow of water from [the Drina's tributaries in] Montenegro which is now, fortunately, subsiding.

""Unfortunately, the huge inflow of garbage has not ceased.""

Image: Part of a refrigerator floats among the waste

The Drina River - which has an intense green colour due to the limestone terrain and is often enjoyed by rafters - runs 346km (215 miles) from the mountains of north western Montenegro through Serbia and Bosnia.

Around 10,000 cubic meters (more than 353,000 cubic feet) of waste are estimated to have collected behind the barrier in recent days. The same amount was pulled in recent years from that area of the river.

Health hazard

Removing the waste could take up to six months and will end up as landfill.

Mr Furtula said the local waste site ""does not even have sufficient capacity to handle [the city's] municipal waste. The fires on the landfill site are always burning.""

He called the conditions there ""not just a huge environmental and health hazard, but also a big embarrassment for all of us.""

Three-and-a-half years of brutal warfare in the 1990s, which left 100,000 dead, has left the Balkans lagging behind Europe both economically and environmentally.

Despite seeking membership in the European Union and adopting some of the EU's laws and regulations, the countries of the region have made little progress in building effective, environmentally sound waste disposal systems.

In addition to river pollution, many countries in the western Balkans are facing extremely high level of air pollution, with some towns among the most polluted on the planet.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230121151733/http://news.sky.com/story/balkan-river-known-for-its-breathtaking-scenery-becomes-floating-rubbish-dump-12791685

The Tory chairman and cabinet member released a statement saying he wanted to ""address some of the confusion"" about his finances.

He said his father took founder shares in YouGov and that HMRC later ""disagreed about the exact allocation"", leading him to ""settle the matter and pay what they said was due"".

""They concluded that this was a 'careless and not deliberate' error,"" he said.

""So that I could focus on my life as a public servant, I chose to settle the matter and pay what they said was due, which was the right thing to do.""

Questions have swirled following an article in The Sun on Sunday, which claimed a seven-figure payment was made by Mr Zahawi to end a dispute with the taxman ""after scrutiny of his family's financial affairs"".

Mr Zahawi also said in his statement: ""As a senior politician I know that scrutiny and propriety are important parts of public life. Twenty-two years ago, I co-founded a company called YouGov. I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved. It is an amazing business that has employed thousands of people and provides a world-beating service.

""When we set it up, I didn't have the money or the expertise to go it alone. So I asked my father to help. In the process, he took founder shares in the business in exchange for some capital and his invaluable guidance. Twenty-one years later, when I was being appointed chancellor of the exchequer, questions were being raised about my tax affairs. I discussed this with the Cabinet Office at the time.""

Mr Zahawi co-founded the polling company before entering politics, with shares kept in Balshore Investments, a Gibraltar-registered family trust.

The firm, which is headquartered in the UK, but has operations in Europe, North America, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, is thought to have a net worth of around £100m.

Pressure has been mounting on the 55-year-old politician to respond to questions over his tax affairs, however up to now he had refused to comment.

The Guardian first reported that he paid a 30% penalty, taking the estimated total tax bill to more than £4.8 million.

Ahead of his statement, Labour had renewed calls for the Prime Minister to take action, and sack Mr Zahawi.

Speaking at the Fabian Society conference on Saturday, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""A few months ago... He was chancellor of the Exchequer and responsible for Britain's tax affairs and tax collection, and we now find that he wasn't so keen to pay himself.

""So, if the Prime Minister wants to stick by his commitment for integrity, honesty and professionalism, he should do the right thing and sack Nadhim Zahawi.""

Mr Zahawi was Chancellor between July and September last year, in the closing days of Boris Johnson's premiership.

However, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab defended Mr Zahawi, telling Sky News: ""I can't speak for the personal tax affairs of a colleague, but what I would say is that Nadhim has been very clear that he's paid all the tax that he's owed, that he's paid it on time, that there's nothing outstanding due, and I think that's of course right and proper.

""If there's further questions, of course, I'm sure there'll be the proper transparency.""

Asked if Mr Zahawi will still be in his post in a month, Mr Raab said: ""A month's a long time in politics. I certainly hope so.""

A spokesman for Mr Zahawi previously said his taxes were ""properly declared and paid in the UK"" and the minister had ""never had to instruct any lawyers to deal with HMRC on his behalf"".

Rishi Sunak also defended his colleague at Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) on Wednesday, saying Mr Zahawi ""has already addressed this matter in full and there's nothing more that I can add"".

At the sombre service in Kyiv, Mr Zelenskyy and his wife, first lady Olena Zelenska, laid flowers on seven coffins draped in the blue and yellow flag of Ukraine and spoke with family members.

The helicopter carrying interior minister Denys Monastyrskyi and the rest of his ministry's leadership crashed near a nursery school building in the residential suburb of Brovary on Wednesday.

About a dozen people died in the disaster - including a child on the ground - which dealt yet another blow to a nation already grieving tens of thousands of civilians and military personnel killed in the war with Russia.

Mr Monastyrskyi, who oversaw the country's police and emergency services, is the most senior official killed since Russia invaded Ukraine.

President Zelenskyy appeared emotional at the service as he spoke briefly with the families of seven of those killed and a small orchestra played.

Officials have not confirmed the cause of the crash but earlier this week Mr Zelenskyy said the incident was a consequence of being at war - a view repeated by Ruslan Stefanchuk, chairman of Ukraine's parliament, speaking after the service.

""All this would not have happened if not for this terrible and undeclared war which the Russian Federation is waging against Ukraine,"" Mr Stefanchuk said.

Russia's war in Ukraine, nearing the end of its 11th month, is ""in a state of deadlock"", according to an assessment by the UK's Ministry of Defence.

It said Ukrainian forces seem to be achieving small gains in the northeast, near the town of Kreminna, while the Russian military has ""likely been reconstituting"" in the eastern town of Soledar, which it took earlier in the week.

""There is a realistic possibility of local Russian advances"" around Bakhmut, an eastern city whose capture would give the Kremlin a long-awaited victory after months of battlefield setbacks, the ministry said in its regular update.

""The biggest surprise of our lives but feeling SO blessed… Our family is getting a lot bigger and we can't wait.""

While she did not share her due date, it is likely the babies are due in the summer.

Celebrity friends were quick to congratulate the couple, with former Love Island winner Molly Mae, who is also pregnant, writing: ""Omg!!! Amazing. Congratulations.""

Tarik Namik failed to show up at court back in December and was handed an eight-year prison sentence in his absence, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.

The court had previously heard how the 45-year-old from Oldham had been found to be the head of an organised crime group involved in transporting migrants from Iraq and Iran to the UK in the back of lorries, the agency added.

Four other members of his gang were sentenced alongside him.

Namik first became a subject of an NCA investigation back in 2017, and a warrant was issued for his arrest after he missed his court date on 9 December.

He was arrested ""the moment he set foot back in the UK"" after landing in Manchester on a flight travelling from Istanbul, the NCA said.

""Namik was a prolific people smuggler whose crime group put vulnerable migrants at great risk while he reaped the profits,"" said NCA branch commander Richard Harrison.

""I'm delighted that he will now face justice for the offences he committed.

""Fugitives never come off our radar, and I'd like to thank our colleagues at Greater Manchester Police for their assistance in ensuring he was detained quickly the moment he set foot back in the UK.""

Taking place between Saturday 6 and Monday 8 May, King Charles has insisted the historic moment should be ""rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry"" but also ""look towards the future"".

The King's first balcony moment as monarch at Buckingham Palace, a grand coronation procession, a concert featuring global stars and a day of volunteering will all form part of the three-day spectacle.

It isn't clear yet exactly how the coronation ceremony on the Saturday will be modernised or changed, except guidance from royal sources that the service will be shorter than the Queen's in 1953, which ran for three hours.

There had been suggestions that due to the cost of living crisis the events should be scaled back to acknowledge the current economic difficulties many are facing.

But royal sources have been adamant that the feedback they have received is that people want to see the full spectacle of a grand national event, showcasing the best of Britain today and celebrating the United Kingdom's rich and unique history.

There are also similarities with the Queen's Platinum Jubilee last year.

While that weekend was designed to be a celebration of her 70 years of service, Queen Elizabeth II also wanted it to be an opportunity to recognise community heroes and bring people together.

Her son and heir wants to follow the same ethos by encouraging street parties on Sunday 7 May and a day of volunteering events on Monday 8 May.

The involvement of refugee and LGBTQ+ choirs on the Sunday concert also appears to be a part of efforts to make the weekend feel as inclusive and diverse as possible.

The coronation itinerary: Saturday 6 and Sunday 7

The coronation of the King and Queen Consort will take place at Westminster Abbey on the Saturday morning, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

The palace says it will be ""a solemn religious service, as well as an occasion for celebration and pageantry"", and involve two processions on the day.

Charles and Camilla will arrive at the Abbey in procession from Buckingham Palace, known as ""the King's procession"". After the service a larger ceremonial procession, known as ""the coronation procession"", will see them return to Buckingham Palace and join the family on the balcony.

The palace has not said exactly which family members will appear in the coronation procession or on the balcony.

On Sunday ""global music icons and contemporary stars"" will descend on Windsor Castle for the coronation concert.

It will also feature ""the Coronation Choir"", a diverse group of community choirs and amateur singers from across the UK, such as refugee choirs, NHS choirs, LGBTQ+ singing groups and deaf signing choirs.

A ticket ballot will be available for members of the public, with representatives from the King and Queen Consort's charity organisations also in the audience.

To spread the celebrations to other parts of the country there will be a ""lighting up the nation"" moment where landmarks across the UK are lit up using projections, lasers, drone displays and illuminations.

Meanwhile, people are invited to gather for a ""coronation big lunch"" on Sunday, overseen and organised by the Big Lunch team at the Eden Project.

147;Labour reports Boris Johnson to standards watchdog over 'quagmire of sleaze' engulfing former PM;Saturday 21 January 2023 22:16, UK;[];['boris johnson'];['prime', 'sharp', 'labour', 'boris', 'sleaze', 'mr', 'johnson', 'minister', 'advice', 'standards', 'chairman', 'party', 'reports', 'engulfing', 'bbc', 'financial', 'watchdog', 'quagmire'];"The Labour Party has reported former prime minister Boris Johnson to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.

It comes following allegations BBC chairman Richard Sharp helped the former prime minister to arrange a guarantee on a loan of up to £800,000 just weeks before he was selected for his current job.

Anneliese Dodds, the Labour Party chair, has written again to Daniel Greenberg CB raising concerns about the alleged arrangement and suggested it could have constituted a breach of the Code of Conduct for MPs.

Ms Dodds said: ""The financial affairs of this disgraced former prime minister just keep getting murkier, dragging the Conservative Party deeper into yet another quagmire of sleaze.

""Serious questions need to be asked of Johnson: why has this money never been declared, and what exactly did he promise these very generous friends in return for such lavish loans?""

The Sunday Times reported Mr Sharp was involved in talks about financing Mr Johnson's Downing Street lifestyle in November and December 2020.

Sam Blyth, a multimillionaire Canadian businessman and distant cousin of the former prime minister, is said to have raised the idea of acting as the prime minister's guarantor, and reportedly asked Mr Sharp for advice on the best way forward.

The now BBC chairman agreed to help and introduced Mr Blyth to Simon Case, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service shortly afterwards, the paper reported.

In Dodds' letter to Mr Greenberg, the Labour MP said the ""lack of transparency"" on the issue could ""call into question the process by which the chairman of the BBC was appointed"" - as this selection was in its final stages at the time.

The SNP have also called for an independent inquiry.

Kirsty Blackman, the SNP's Cabinet Office spokesperson, said the existence of the facility, and the appointment of Mr Sharp to the £160,000 a year role as BBC chairman by Mr Johnson, ""reeks of Tory sleaze"".

""The UK government must establish an independent inquiry to assess the circumstances of this loan, the propriety of the arrangement, the ethics of the appointment, and whether any rules were broken by Mr Johnson, the UK government or the BBC chairman,"" she said.

""Many people will have serious concerns about the existence of this loan, the circumstances of arranging it, and the increasingly close relationship between the Tory government and senior management at the BBC. This murky arrangement stinks to high heaven.""

Responding to the report, Mr Sharp told The Sunday Times: ""There is not a conflict when I simply connected, at his request, Mr Blyth with the cabinet secretary and had no further involvement whatsoever.""

A spokesman for Mr Johnson told the paper: ""This is rubbish. Richard Sharp has never given any financial advice to Boris Johnson, nor has Mr Johnson sought any financial advice from him. There has never been any remuneration or compensation to Mr Sharp from Boris Johnson for this or any other service.

""Mr Johnson did indeed have dinner with Mr Sharp, whom he has known for almost 20 years, and with his cousin. So what? Big deal. All Mr Johnson's financial arrangements have been properly declared and registered on the advice of officials.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230121230208/http://news.sky.com/story/labour-reports-boris-johnson-to-standards-watchdog-over-quagmire-of-sleaze-engulfing-former-pm-12792440

Demonstrations have spread through the Andean nation since early December, with new clashes reported in Cusco, the gateway to the nearby Inca trail and ancient ruins of Machu Picchu.

Cultural authorities in Cusco said in a statement that ""in view of the current social situation in which our region and the country are immersed, the closure of the Inca trail network and Machu Picchu has been ordered, as of 21 January and until further notice"".

Protesters attempted to take over the city's airport, used by many foreign tourists to access the area, leaving 37 civilians and six police officers injured, according to health workers.

Airports in Arequipa and the southern city of Juliaca were also attacked by demonstrators, damaging Peru's tourism industry.

Protests and road blockades against Peruvian President Dina Boluarte's government and in support of ousted president Pedro Castillo also broke out in 41 provinces, mainly in Peru's south.

Some of the worst violence came on Monday when 17 people were killed in clashes with police in the city of Juliaca, near Lake Titicaca. Protesters later attacked and burned a police officer to death.

On Friday security forces in the capital Lima unleashed tear gas to repel demonstrators throwing glass bottles and stones, as fires burned in the streets.

Unrest was sparked in early December by the destitution and arrest of Castillo, Peru's first president of humble, rural roots, following his widely condemned attempt to dissolve Congress to avoid an impeachment trial.

151;Joe Biden: White House says six more classified documents found in search of US president's home;Sunday 22 January 2023 01:00, UK;[];['joe biden'];['markings', 'house', 'mr', 'bidens', 'previously', 'biden', 'classified', 'search', 'documents', 'president', 'white', 'presidents', 'joe'];"Six further documents containing classification markings have been found at US President Joe Biden's home in Delaware, his lawyer has said.

Bob Bauer said the Justice Department conducted the search at Mr Biden's Wilmington residence on Friday, which he said lasted approximately 13 hours.

In a statement, Mr Bauer said the Justice Department ""took possession of materials it deemed within the scope of its inquiry, including six items consisting of documents with classification markings and surrounding materials, some of which were from the president's service in the Senate and some of which were from his tenure as vice president"".

The prosecutors also ""took for further review personally handwritten notes from the vice-presidential years"", he added.

Neither Mr Biden nor first lady Jill Biden were present throughout the duration of the search at their home.

Earlier this month, Mr Biden's legal team acknowledged it had found classified documents relating to his time as vice president in the Obama administration at his home, including some in his garage.

Aides previously found another batch of classified documents at his residence, and at a Washington think tank he was associated with.

A few days later, Mr Biden's lawyers said five additional pages with classified markings were found at the president's home in Delaware, after previously saying only a single page had been found.

White House lawyer Richard Sauber said in a statement that a total of six pages of classified documents were discovered during a search of the president's private library.

The apparent mishandling of classified documents and official records from the Obama administration is under investigation by a former US attorney, Robert Hur, who was appointed as a special counsel this month by Attorney General Merrick Garland.

Mr Sauber reiterated that the White House would cooperate with Mr Hur's investigation.

The discoveries have trickled out over the past few weeks, causing concern among the president's allies that his office does not have a handle on the growing scandal.

Republicans have sought to compare the investigation of Mr Biden's handling of classified documents to the ongoing probe into how former president Donald Trump handled classified documents after his presidency.

The White House, however, previously said the two cases are different because Mr Biden's team has cooperated with authorities in their probe and turned over documents, while Mr Trump had resisted doing so until an FBI search at his Florida home.

152;'Digital mimics' among 16 projects launched to help NHS with winter pressure;Sunday 22 January 2023 00:05, UK;[];['nhs'];['digital', 'data', '16', 'ai', 'mimics', 'pressures', 'using', 'hospital', 'projects', 'help', 'pressure', 'winter', 'times', 'health', 'launched', 'nhs'];"Researchers are using artificial intelligence (AI) to ""digitally mimic"" households struggling with the impact of the cost of living crisis to simulate the most effective ways to help.

It's one of more than a dozen projects spanning data analysis to machine learning that have been launched to help counter the winter pressures facing the NHS.

It comes as the health service buckles under the strain of large numbers of flu and COVID cases, a huge backlog exacerbated by the pandemic, and mounting wait times for ambulances and emergency and routine care.

The 16 projects, launched by Health Data Research UK (HDR), hope to deliver findings by the end of March.

Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the goal was to channel ""the spirit of innovation"" that led to the rapid rollout of coronavirus vaccines, with the government providing £800,000 in funding.

If you are an NHS worker and would like to share your experiences with us anonymously, please email NHSstories@sky.uk

While many of the projects seek to find ways of using technology to relieve pressure on hospital staff, others seek to address some of the root causes of the troubles facing the NHS.

One such initiative uses existing data and AI to ""digitally mimic"" household environments and simulate interventions that might improve the standard of people's health at home - especially children.

Dr Martin Chapman, from King's College London, explained: ""Living in cold, damp, and mouldy homes leads to chest conditions in children and mental health problems in adolescents, and rising energy costs mean more people than ever are living with heat poverty.

""We're investigating the effectiveness of interventions like support for energy bills on the health of young people by using AI to digitally mimic their household environments and evaluate the impact of simulated interventions.

""This will help guide future policy changes to improve health conditions, reduce inequalities, and in turn reduce pressures on NHS services.""

What are some of the projects?

Using the same infrastructure that powered Siren, which collated and published regular public data on COVID at the peak of the pandemic, the winter pressures sub-study will see it expand to include flu and a common children's illness called Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).

Another project aims to use AI to help clinicians more easily identify high-risk patients.

By analysing patient data, an AI model could suggest the most suitable ward for a patient to be on, those at most immediate risk of deterioration, and when someone should be discharged or not.

Also focused on hospital discharge times is a project called DS4SmartDischarge.

This uses machine learning (the process of teaching a computer to do something by itself) to help computers categorise patients based on the risk of different discharge outcomes.

Another team made up of health care workers, hospital leaders and the Society of Acute Medicine is also using machine learning to help build a model that identifies patients in need of same day emergency care.

Patients would be graded based on data like blood pressure, medications and bedside tests, helping staff make a decision within four hours of them coming to hospital.

Project lead Professor Elizabeth Sapey said the work would help with ""reducing inequalities in care and relieving pressure on emergency services"".

'Rapid response to evolving pressures'

While the projects come too late for the current crisis enveloping the health service, it is hoped they will produce results that help it better cope in the long term.

Professor Cathie Sudlow, chief scientist at HDR, said they would hone in on ""key pain points"" in the NHS.

""By using existing data, research teams, and infrastructure, these projects are able to respond rapidly to evolving pressures on the NHS,"" she added.

Each of the projects has been partnered with analysts in the Department of Health, which sponsored the plans; the Office for National Statistics; and the UK Health Security Agency.

153;Why will Camilla be crowned during King's coronation - and what may happen in 'simpler ceremony' for Queen Consort?;Wednesday 12 October 2022 09:24, UK;['lara keay', '@larakeay'];['the king'];['kings', 'king', 'prince', 'coronation', 'title', 'consort', 'charles', 'ceremony', 'camilla', 'crowned', 'royal', 'queen', 'known', 'happen', 'simpler'];"The Queen Consort will be by the King's side when he is formally crowned next year.

Camilla will also be anointed and crowned during the ceremony for King Charles III at Westminster Abbey on 6 May 2023.

What will happen at the King's coronation?

While plans for his investiture have been in place since his mother's coronation in 1953, her part was only confirmed when during her Platinum Jubilee the Queen declared Camilla would be known as Queen Consort on King Charles's accession.

'A similar, but simpler ceremony'

Following the King's six-part coronation ceremony, the Queen Consort will have her own one.

According to the Royal Family's website: ""A Queen Consort is crowned with the King, in a similar, but simpler ceremony.""

The last Queen Consort to be crowned was the Queen Mother alongside King George VI in 1937.

The Archbishop of Canterbury anointed her head with holy oil - a ritual also carried out with the monarch.

The Queen's ring was then placed on her hand, her crown on her head, before she was presented with a sceptre and an ivory rod.

It ended with her bowing ""reverently"" to her husband.

Camilla will also be anointed with holy oil and crowned.

Why is Camilla Queen Consort?

When the King and Queen Consort married in 2005 - eight years after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales - she let it be known that she intended to use the title ""princess consort"". It would be a first in the history of the British monarchy.

The decision was seen as an acknowledgment that the public was finding it difficult to accept her new role, after years of speculation in the media over their affair, the bitter divorce of Charles and Diana, and Diana's death in 1997.

For the same reason, upon marrying King Charles, who was Prince of Wales at the time, she decided not to use the Princess of Wales title, which had been used by Diana.

Instead, she chose the Duchess of Cornwall, styling herself on her husband's other title the Duke of Cornwall, which is always given to the heir presumptive.

Reflecting on the negative press she received during that period, in an interview with British Vogue, Camilla admitted it ""wasn't easy"".

""I was scrutinised for such a long time that you just have to find a way to live with it,"" she said.

""Nobody likes to be looked at all the time and, you know, criticised... but I think in the end, I sort of rise above it and get on with it.""

Civil wedding

At the time, there were also legal questions surrounding the validity of the couple's civil wedding - which might have added to the decision to opt for princess consort.

They married in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall. But under the Marriage Acts 1753 the only type of marriage valid for a member of the Royal Family is a religious one.

In 2005, the Lord Chancellor sought to defend the validity of their marriage, but Palace aides feared that breaking precedent could have meant more unwanted legal challenges over other titles in the future.

Princess Consort or Queen Consort?

According to common law, wives of kings are known as queen consorts, but the husbands of queens only prince consorts.

As a result, the Duke of Edinburgh was known as Prince Philip - and not given the title of King when he married the Queen.

He did not have his own coronation, but 'paid homage' to his wife during her ceremony instead.

Camilla becomes more popular

After the wedding, Camilla's popularity started to grow - and so did calls by her supporters to make her Queen Consort.

A YouGov poll carried out in late 2021 ranked her as the 10th most popular royal, beating Prince Andrew, whose popularity plummeted due to his association with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Royal author Penny Junor said: ""The problem with Camilla was that she was involved with the Prince of Wales and was what Diana famously called the third person in the marriage.""

But she added: ""When she then married him, she was out and about and people met her. They realised that actually, she wasn't this ghastly woman, a rottweiler, she was actually very nice.

""She's funny, she's warm, she's friendly, she's self-deprecating, she's interested in other people.""

Royal observers also noted she took on more responsibilities after Andrew, Harry and Meghan stepped back from royal duties.

The King is long thought to have favoured the title of Queen Consort. According to Sky News royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills, while the issue hadn't occupied his mind ""on a weekly basis"", it was nonetheless ""something he wanted addressed"".

The debate over Camilla's title could have also acted as an unwelcome distraction at the start of his reign, she adds.

Queen's Jubilee statement ended years of uncertainty

In February 2022, as her Platinum Jubilee celebrations got under way, the Queen surprised the nation by announcing that Camilla would be known as Queen Consort when Charles III took the throne.

She said in a statement: ""When, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his wife Camilla the same support that you have given me; and it is my sincere wish that, when the time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.""

This effectively put an end to nearly two decades of uncertainty over her position within the Royal Family.

It also served as a way to thank Camilla for years of royal duties - and as recognition the public had warmed to her in that time.

Rhiannon Mills commented: ""The Queen clearly wanted to use this opportunity to thank Camilla who over the past 17 years has rolled her sleeves up, embraced the sometimes less glamorous royal engagements and in Her Majesty's eyes shown herself to be a worthy future consort, in the mould of Prince Philip and the Queen Mother.""

What will her role be?

The Queen Consort has taken on a number of causes in recent years, such as raising awareness of domestic violence, sexual abuse or illiteracy.

But royal observers say her main role will be supporting the new King.

""She is to Charles what Prince Philip was to Elizabeth. She is not in competition with him. She is there purely to support him,"" said Ms Junor, the royal author.

In her 2022 British Vogue interview Camilla said that balancing her marriage to Charles with their royal work ""is not easy sometimes"", but the couple always make sure to ""sit down together and have a cup of tea and discuss the day"".

Constitutional expert Craig Prescott described her as the King's ""secret weapon, or not so secret weapon"".

He said: ""She has become sort of one of the more interesting members of the Royal Family, taking up interest in causes, domestic violence, the importance of childhood reading, the importance of live theatre during the pandemic, and sort of the need to speak up for the creative industries.

""Despite the difficulty she had in the 90s with the media, she seems very open, very relaxed - and that might be sort of actually the model that the monarchy will take in the future.""

Sir Peter Westmacott, former deputy private secretary of King Charles, also noted the strong bond in the royal couple.

""She has made such a difference to his life all this time. He adores her and vice versa,"" he said.

""It is an invaluable partnership.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230122021728/http://news.sky.com/story/why-will-camilla-be-crowned-during-kings-coronation-and-what-may-happen-in-simpler-ceremony-for-queen-consort-12718111

Like his mother, the King will be crowned at Westminster Abbey, in the presence of faith leaders, peers, MPs, and foreign heads of state.

Here Sky News looks at what we can expect from the service on Monday 6 May that will be conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the events taking place in the following days.

What will happen on the day?

The Queen's coronation took place at 11.15am on 2 June 1953.

Although specific timings have not yet been released, on the day, King Charles will travel from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey with his Queen Consort, Camilla, in what is known as ""the King's procession"".

Like his mother and father, they are likely to be taken in the gold state coach, which is reserved for coronations and jubilees.

Up to a million people travelled to London to watch the coach along the Mall in 1953.

The ceremony will be broadcast live on television, but the number of guests who attend in person is expected to be cut from 8,000 to 2,000.

It is thought it will be shorter than the previous one - lasting just over an hour instead of three.

Peers will wear suits and formal dresses as opposed to ceremonial robes and many of the traditional rituals, including the presentation of gold ingots, will not feature this time.

In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: ""The coronation will reflect the monarch's role today and look towards the future, while being rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry.""

Despite speculation that the current cost of living crisis and the King's desire for a slimmed down monarchy will mean a more muted ceremony, royal sources are adamant that feedback indicated people want to see the best of Britain today, and celebrate the United Kingdom's rich and unique history.

Image: The Queen and Prince Philip ride in the gold state coach to Westminster Abbey

There will also be similarities with the Queen's Platinum Jubilee last year.

Queen Elizabeth's son and heir wanted to follow a similar ethos of recognising community heroes and bringing people together, by encouraging street parties on Sunday 7 May and a day of volunteering events on Monday 8 May.

After the ceremony, the King and Queen Consort will be joined by other family members on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to conclude the day's ceremonial events.

It is still unknown whether Prince Harry and wife Meghan will be among those attending.

Six-part ceremony

There are six parts to the coronation - the recognition, oath, anointing, investiture, enthronement and homage.

The recognition sees the monarch stand in the theatre - the central part of the Abbey - and turn to the north, south, east and west to ""show himself unto the people"".

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will then declare him the ""undoubted King"".

This ritual dates back to Anglo-Saxon times.

Image: The Queen's funeral was held at Westminster Abbey

Second is the coronation oath, which will see the King promise to reign according to law, exercise justice with mercy and maintain the Church of England.

He will then be presented with the Sword of State and declare at the altar: ""The things which I have here before promised, I will perform, and keep. So help me God"", before kissing the Bible and signing the oath.

The third part - the anointing - follows, which is the process of blessing and consecrating the new monarch with holy oil - the central act of the religious ceremony. The King will remove his crimson robe and sit in King Edward's Chair.

Fourthly, the investiture is the official crowning.

It will see the King dressed in special robes and presented with the orb, coronation ring, sceptre and rod.

Sitting in King Edward's Chair, he will be crowned with St Edward's Crown before the congregation shouts out ""God Save the King"".

Image: The Queen carries the orb and sceptre during her coronation ceremony in 1953

This is followed by the enthroning, which will see the monarch lifted onto a different throne by archbishops, bishops and ""other peers of the kingdom"".

The final stage of the King's coronation is known as homage.

It sees the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Prince of Wales and other royal blood princes paying tribute to the King by placing their hands between his and kissing his right hand.

Camilla to be crowned

The Queen Consort will then also be crowned.

Unlike the wives of Kings, the husbands of Queens do not become King Consorts and are therefore not crowned.

But ahead of her Platinum Jubilee, the Queen announced Camilla would be known as Queen Consort on King Charles's accession.

Instead the Duke of Edinburgh ""paid homage"" to Queen Elizabeth II immediately after the formal coronation - as Prince William and other princes are likely to do this time.

The Queen Mother was anointed and crowned during her husband's coronation in 1937.

According to the Royal Family's website: ""A Queen consort is crowned with the King, in a similar but simpler ceremony.""

The coronation concert

On Sunday, the day after the coronation, ""global music icons and contemporary stars"" descend on Windsor Castle for the coronation concert.

Thousands of members of the public will be selected to receive a pair of free tickets, which are up for grabs through a national ballot held by the BBC, which will also broadcast the event live.

Bank holiday Monday dubbed 'the big help out'

Coronations have traditionally fallen on weekdays, which have been declared bank holidays to allow the public to get involved by either watching on TV or crowding the streets in London.

As King Charles's coronation will fall on a Saturday, Monday 8 May has been set as a bank holiday in all four nations of the UK.

The day is being billed as ""the big help out"" and has been set aside for volunteering to help highlight the positive impact volunteering has on communities.

155;Canada to repatriate British-born 'Jihadi Jack' along with 22 others held in Syria;Sunday 22 January 2023 02:29, UK;[];['canada', 'syria'];['canada', 'british', 'canadian', 'letts', 'citizenship', 'jack', 'camps', 'court', 'held', 'repatriate', 'britishborn', '22', 'jihadi', 'syria', 'men'];"Canada has been ordered to repatriate 23 Canadian citizens being held in Islamic State prison camps in Syria - including British-born Muslim convert Jack Letts, it is understood.

Letts, who had held dual UK and Canadian citizenship, left his family home in Oxford in 2014 to allegedly fight with IS as a teenager.

He previously told Sky News he wanted to be released from jail to join the fight against Islamist radicalisation.

Known as ""Jihadi Jack"", Letts was stripped of his British citizenship in 2019 by the Home Office.

In a ruling late on Friday, the Canadian federal court said the government must bring home four Canadian men - after an agreement was reached earlier this week to repatriate six women and 13 children also being held in camps in northeast Syria.

It follows a court case brought against the government by the detainees' relatives who argued that preventing them from returning to Canada would violate their constitutional rights.

Federal court judge Henry Brown directed the government to request the repatriation of the men as soon as reasonably possible and provide them with passports or emergency travel documents.

The Canadians held in Syria are among the many foreign nationals in prison camps across the war-torn region, which are run by Kurdish forces that reclaimed the territory from IS.

Judge Brown said a representative of the federal government must travel to Syria in order to facilitate the return of the men after their captors agree to hand them over.

Letts, who converted to Islam at the age of 16, was caught by Kurdish authorities who have held him prisoner since 2017.

The decision to strip British citizenship from Letts, who is a Canadian national because his father was born in Canada, follows the revocation of IS bride Shamima Begum's British citizenship in February 2019.

In an interview with Sky News, Letts confessed to fighting against the Syrian regime but said he regretted being with the ""wrong people"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230122030218/http://news.sky.com/story/canada-to-repatriate-british-born-jihadi-jack-along-with-22-others-held-in-syria-12792505
156;Chinese New Year 2023: How it is celebrated - and what the Year of the Rabbit signifies;Sunday 22 January 2023 02:43, UK;[];[];['lunar', 'chinese', 'water', 'symbol', 'rabbit', 'pic', 'dance', 'festival', '2023', 'signifies', 'celebrated', 'lion', 'zodiac'];"Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year, is celebrated over multiple days and marks the beginning of the coming 12 months on the traditional lunisolar calendar.

The occasion is observed by many people of Chinese descent and is also commemorated in other countries across Asia, including South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore.

Here, Sky News takes a look at this year's celebrations - and how it's significant.

What is this year's Zodiac animal?

Ending the year of the Water Tiger, which is seen as a symbol of strength, braveness and exorcising evils, the 2023 Lunar New Year is set to welcome the Year of the Rabbit.

The Rabbit is the fourth animal in the zodiac sequence of 12, and is seen as the luckiest.

People born in the year of the Rabbit are believed to be vigilant, witty, quick-minded and ingenious.

The animal is also said to signify mercy, elegance and beauty.

In the Chinese five-element theory, it is believed that each zodiac sign has one of the five elements: Metal, wood, water, fire or earth.

These elements rotate for each year on which the sign falls, meaning they come every 60 years.

This year is the Water Rabbit, which last came in 1903 and 1963.

There are five types of rabbit, each said to have different characteristics - and those associated with the Water Rabbit suggest believers in the Chinese lunisolar calendar who were born in those years may not be entirely pleased.

The traits linked to each of the rabbits are:

Water Rabbit: Gentle and amicable, but has a weak mindset

Wood Rabbit: Clever and quick-witted, but selfish

Fire Rabbit: Broad-minded, smart and flexible

Earth Rabbit: Straightforward, ambitious and hard-working

Metal Rabbit: Kind-hearted, lively and enthusiastic

When is the 2023 Lunar New Year?

The Year of the Tiger ends on 21 January and the Year of the Rabbit begins the following day, on 22 January.

How Chinese New Year celebrated?

One of the most important holidays in the Chinese calendar, the Lunar New Year kicks off a 15-day festival of celebrations in China and among Chinese communities around the world.

Commonly known in China as Spring Festival, people in the country get seven consecutive days off each year to mark the occasion.

During this period, there are a number of traditions.

Festivities get under way with a lion dance, in which performers mimic a lion's movements while in a lion costume - with the animal symbolising power, wisdom, and superiority.

The performers move with the rhythm of the beating of the drum, cymbals and gong. The loud sounds are intended to scare away evil spirits and welcome the lion to bring in good fortune.

A dragon dance is the highlight of the celebration in many areas, as the dragon is a symbol of good fortune.

Other traditions include people cleaning their homes thoroughly to rid the household of bad luck.

Some eat specially prepared foods on certain days during the celebrations, which are also supposed to bring good luck.

They include dumplings, which are often eaten on Chinese New Year's eve and symbolise wealth, and sweet rice balls - a symbol of family togetherness.

The last event of the celebration is called the Lantern Festival, during which people hang glowing lanterns in temples or carry them during parades.

157;Freezing fog warning across much of England - as conditions trigger air pollution alert for London;Sunday 22 January 2023 03:53, UK;[];['london', 'uk weather'];['week', 'pollution', 'met', 'air', 'england', 'fog', 'conditions', 'temperatures', 'warning', 'london', 'freezing', 'cold', 'trigger', 'alert', 'uk', 'mayor'];"Freezing fog will create dangerous driving conditions in England on Sunday, the Met Office has said, as the London Mayor warned the weather would exacerbate air pollution in the capital.

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for fog covering much of England, including Yorkshire, the South East and the Midlands.

Travellers should plan for slower journey times by car, possible disruption to bus and train services and a chance of delayed or cancelled flights, forecasters said.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned pollution would intensify on Sunday as cold, foggy conditions trap in emissions from cars and vans that burn fossil fuels.

""On Sunday, alongside the extreme cold temperatures we've been experiencing, we are also expecting moderate to high levels of air pollution,"" he said.

The mayor has issued a ""moderate"" air pollution alert.

Air pollution increases the risk of respiratory infections, heart disease and lung cancer and tends to hit those who are already ill, children the elderly and poor people, according to the World Health Organisation.

The mayor urged Londoners to ""look after each other by choosing to walk, cycle or take public transport, avoiding unnecessary car journeys, stopping engine idling and not burning wood or garden waste, all of which contributes to high levels of pollution.

""This is particularly important in order to protect those who are more vulnerable.""

The warning tops off an extremely cold week, when temperatures plunged below -10C in parts of the UK amid snow and icy conditions.

But Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell said the worst of the cold snap is over, with warmer temperatures on the way next week across the whole of the UK.

Mr Snell said: ""Next week, looking at the severe front, it's looking pretty benign.

""We're starting to lose the risk of fog and temperatures are generally around where they should be.

""We'll probably lose the really hard frosts. In terms of ice and snow, it certainly looks like we're over the worst.

""We've got to keep an eye on risk of fog generally this cold spell, although the main hazards from it look like they are beginning to diminish.""

The change will come as the Arctic blast that swept across the UK in the past five days gives way to warmer air from the Atlantic, but will take longer to reach southern areas.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230122041706/http://news.sky.com/story/freezing-fog-warning-across-much-of-england-as-conditions-trigger-air-pollution-alert-for-london-12792265
158;Matteo Messina Denaro: After the arrest of Italy's most wanted criminal, what next for the Mafia?;Sunday 22 January 2023 04:23, UK;['chris lockyer', '@_chrislockyer'];['italy', 'sicily', 'mafia'];['italys', 'boss', 'structure', 'italy', 'run', 'cosa', 'palermo', 'messina', 'mafia', 'denaro', 'arrest', 'wanted', 'matteo', 'criminal', 'sicilian', 'nostra'];"The arrest of a murderous mob boss who had been on the run for decades has prompted relief around Italy - while raising a pressing question: what becomes of the Mafia now?

Matteo Messina Denaro was detained on 16 January while he was at a hospital appointment, where he was getting treatment for cancer.

He had been on the run since 1993 and was jailed in absentia for murders he carried out in the early 1990s.

But with Messina Denaro now out of the picture, who is now poised to take control of the Mafia?

Why was he important in the Mafia?

While Messina Denaro was Italy's most wanted fugitive and the top boss in the Mafia, some experts say he did not control all the Mafia clans - in part because he was not from the Sicilian capital of Palermo.

Still, he was billed as the ""last godfather"" and was the last fugitive member of a generation of mobsters who masterminded a string of bombings and murders that terrorised Italy in the early 1990s.

The man who was once the ""boss of all bosses"", Salvatore 'Toto' Riina, was arrested in 1993 and died in 2017. His right-hand man, Bernando Provenzano, was arrested in 2006 and died in 2016.

According to some experts, Cosa Nostra, as the Sicilian Mafia is known, has lacked a supreme leader for years, possibly since Riina - in part because the various clans struggled to convene and select one.

Historian John Dickie, who wrote the book Cosa Nostra: The Definitive History of the Sicilian Mafia, told Sky News the Mafia is broken up, suggesting it might struggle to find someone to lead the group of clans around Palermo.

He said the Mafia's ""hierarchy, its leadership structure, its whole territorial structure... has been hugely disrupted"" since the early 1990s.

Police think the Mafia is on the hunt for a super-boss

But some investigators see the Sicilian Mafia as a ""single-headed structure"" - and believe it is searching for its new super-boss.

Speaking about the future of the Mafia shortly after Messina Denaro's arrest, Palermo Prosecutor General Lia Sava said: ""What will happen in detail, we can't know.

""But one thing is sure: Cosa Nostra is made up of rules. It has supported itself on these rules for 150 years, so certainly it will put into motion those rules to repair the damage, and thus create the new leadership structure needed after the arrest.""

Who could become top boss?

So, if the clans get around the table and elect a new head, who would be in the running?

According to many reports in Italy, 85-year-old Settimo Mineo is a frontrunner. Officially, he runs a jewellery shop in Palermo, but he is also considered one of the oldest heads of the Mafia, being named as successor to Riina following his death.

Mineo, like many Mafia members, is currently serving a lengthy jail sentence after being arrested on suspicion of being the Mafia's top boss - but it is not unusual for leaders to run the business from behind bars.

Corriere della Sera, Italy's leading newspaper, believes 64-year-old Giovanni Motisi - known to most as ""The Fatman"", could be next in line.

He is the boss of the organisation's Pagliarelli district in Palermo, and has been on the run since 1998 after being found guilty of murdering a police officer. Motisi was also believed to be Riina's most trusted hitman.

He is one of the most wanted men in Italy, with some even saying he may be dead.

The daily paper also says Giuseppe Auteri, 48, the treasurer of the richest Mafia district in Palermo, is also in the running.

Though a barrier for Auteri could be the fact he has been on the run for a year in the Sicilian underbelly.

Sandro Capizzi also has leadership ambitions in Sicily, according to Sky Tg24. The 41-year-old's father, Benedetto, attempted to seize power in Cosa Nostra by force in 2008, but the pair were arrested by police who feared Sicily was on the brink of a new Mafia war.

But, the junior of the pair is free from prison and is said to be gunning for head honcho.

So what's next for the Cosa Nostra?

Despite its fame as a powerful and ruthless crime syndicate, the Mafia has been struggling for years.

In the lucrative drugs market, it has been supplanted by the 'Ndrangheta, an organisation based in the Calabria region in southern Italy.

Though the Mafia does retain control of Sicily and some parts of the economy, Anna Sergi, an organised crime expert at Essex University, said: ""Messina Denaro was the last godfather, he represented all the secrets of Cosa Nostra.

""It is the end of a myth and the organisation will have to cope with this.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230122043214/http://news.sky.com/story/matteo-messina-denaro-after-the-arrest-of-italys-most-wanted-criminal-what-next-for-the-mafia-12790186

The 41-year-old US star put on a 90-minute set for the concert at the unveiling of Atlantis The Royal, billed as the world's most ultra-luxury resort.

Beyonce emerged in front of a 1,500-strong crowd in a yellow sequinned gown with a sculptural feathered cape, opening with her cover of Etta James's At Last.

She also sang some of her biggest hits including Crazy In Love, Naughty Girl, Halo and XO, culminating with a rendition of Drink In Love as fireworks lit up the sky.

Eleven-year-old Blue Ivy gave the audience a surprise when she joined her superstar mother for a duet on stage on Brown Skin Girl from the 2019 album The Lion King: The Gift.

Members of the crowd were told to put their phones in pouches and were reportedly reprimanded by security if they were spotted taking photos.

The headline concert leaned heavily on songs rarely or never before performed live, with the singer opting not to debut any tracks from her latest album Renaissance, which is nominated for two Grammys.

Addressing the excited audience, Beyonce said: ""There's a Utopia of people from all over the world on this stage and we are so honoured to be here to celebrate this night with you.

""My parents are here tonight to celebrate - my mother and my father. My beautiful children are here to see me perform and my beautiful husband.""

The Destiny's Child star later changed into a red and gold bejewelled bodysuit with a voluminous train before completing a third costume change with a red corseted minidress with matching stockings and gloves.

She was reported to have been paid $24m (£19.4m) for the exclusive concert, attended by celebrities including Kendall Jenner, Liam Payne, Ronan Keating, Rochelle and Marvin Humes and British Vogue editor Edward Enninful.

""We've given her creative control. This is her art - we want her to express her art in her way,"" managing director Tim Kelly said.

""I can't express to you enough the level of professionalism and discipline with the rehearsals.

""From the moment she arrived last week, she was on the stage, rehearsing and performing, and she's developing and curating a performance.

""She's not taking a show out of the box because she doesn't have a show in the box. You're going to get the full-throttle Beyonce.""

Mr Kelly added it ""took a long time"" to secure the global pop star for the launch, but said it ""came together rather quickly"".

He said: ""It's a circumstance of where she chooses what she wants to do. We're honoured, we're proud and for her to be here to do this in Dubai on this night, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

""We have always expressed that this is an iconic building, and then to have the most iconic performer on the planet available today, someone who hasn't been seen in public performing in over four years, it's really a night of icons.""

160;Grant Shapps launches crackdown on energy firms forcing financially stretched households to switch to prepayment meters;Sunday 22 January 2023 06:02, UK;[];['cost of living', 'energy price cap', 'grant shapps'];['launches', 'energy', 'switch', 'forced', 'vulnerable', 'firms', 'customers', 'stretched', 'prepayment', 'grant', 'forcing', 'suppliers', 'support', 'meters', 'secretary', 'shapps', 'households'];"Grant Shapps has launched a crackdown on energy suppliers, following reports some are not doing enough to support vulnerable customers amid the cost of living crisis.

The Business and Energy Secretary has written a letter to energy suppliers, telling them to stop the practice of forced fitting prepayment meters as the answer to families struggling to pay their bills, following a huge surge of cases.

He has asked them to share data on the number of warrants they have requested for this purpose in order to name and shame the worst offenders.

Mr Shapps said he wants to see much greater efforts from suppliers to help consumers in payment difficulties before leaping to the extreme of forced prepayment switching, such as offers of additional credit, debt forgiveness or tools such as debt advice.

He has also asked suppliers to discuss possible further action they can take to support customers and avoid forced fitting.

The crackdown is part of a drive to increase transparency around prepayment meter installations in a bid to track down the worst culprits and reveal which energy companies are trigger-happy in applying for them.

It comes as courts are being overwhelmed with an increasing number of applications for warrants, with reports that huge batches are being approved in a matter of minutes.

The business secretary is working with Ofgem and the Secretary of State for Justice to ensure that the process by which suppliers bring these cases to court is fair, transparent and supports vulnerable customers.

Mr Shapps said: ""Suppliers are clearly jumping the gun and moving at-risk customers onto prepayment meters before offering them the support they are entitled to - I simply cannot believe that every possible alternative has been exhausted in all these cases.""

He said he is ""deeply concerned"" to hear customers are being switched to prepayment meters against their will, with some disconnected from supply - and ""quite literally left in the dark"".

""Rather than immediately reaching for a new way to extract money out of customers, I want suppliers to stop this practice and lend a more sympathetic ear, offering the kind of forbearance and support that a vulnerable customer struggling to pay should be able to expect,"" he added.

Concerns have also been raised over the low number of vouchers being redeemed under the government's Energy Bills Support Scheme - resulting in many vulnerable households not having cash knocked off their energy bills.

Prepayment meters let customers pay for gas and electricity on a pay-as-you-go basis, and can help with the avoidance of debt and court action. A moratorium on forced prepayment switching could prompt an increase in bailiff action - so the government wishes to avoid going down this route.

Mr Shapps has also written to energy regulator Ofgem asking what they do more to make sure suppliers protect vulnerable consumers, from revisiting their approach to enforcing supplier compliance, to the urgent publication of recent investigations outcomes into vulnerable customers.

The Minister for Energy and Climate Graham Stuart has asked energy suppliers, Ofgem, Energy UK and Citizens Advice to meet with him at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to discuss matters further next week.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230122061738/http://news.sky.com/story/grant-shapps-launches-crackdown-on-energy-firms-forcing-financially-stretched-households-to-switch-to-prepayment-meters-12792516

Like his mother, the King will be crowned at Westminster Abbey, in the presence of faith leaders, peers, MPs, and foreign heads of state.

Here Sky News looks at what we can expect from the service on Monday 6 May that will be conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the events taking place in the following days.

Image: The gold state coach was used for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation

What will happen on the day?

The Queen's coronation took place at 11.15am on 2 June 1953.

Although specific timings have not yet been released, on the day, King Charles will travel from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey with his Queen Consort, Camilla, in what is known as ""the King's procession"".

Like his mother and father, they are likely to be taken in the gold state coach, which is reserved for coronations and jubilees.

Up to a million people travelled to London to watch the coach along the Mall in 1953.

The ceremony will be broadcast live on television, but the number of guests who attend in person is expected to be cut from 8,000 to 2,000.

It is thought it will be shorter than the previous one - lasting just over an hour instead of three.

Peers will wear suits and formal dresses as opposed to ceremonial robes and many of the traditional rituals, including the presentation of gold ingots, will not feature this time.

In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: ""The coronation will reflect the monarch's role today and look towards the future, while being rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry.""

Despite speculation that the current cost of living crisis and the King's desire for a slimmed down monarchy will mean a more muted ceremony, royal sources are adamant that feedback indicated people want to see the best of Britain today, and celebrate the United Kingdom's rich and unique history.

Image: The Queen and Prince Philip ride in the gold state coach to Westminster Abbey

There will also be similarities with the Queen's Platinum Jubilee last year.

Queen Elizabeth's son and heir wanted to follow a similar ethos of recognising community heroes and bringing people together, by encouraging street parties on Sunday 7 May and a day of volunteering events on Monday 8 May.

After the ceremony, the King and Queen Consort will be joined by other family members on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to conclude the day's ceremonial events.

It is still unknown whether Prince Harry and wife Meghan will be among those attending.

Six-part ceremony

There are six parts to the coronation - the recognition, oath, anointing, investiture, enthronement and homage.

The recognition sees the monarch stand in the theatre - the central part of the Abbey - and turn to the north, south, east and west to ""show himself unto the people"".

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will then declare him the ""undoubted King"".

This ritual dates back to Anglo-Saxon times.

Image: The Queen's funeral was held at Westminster Abbey

Second is the coronation oath, which will see the King promise to reign according to law, exercise justice with mercy and maintain the Church of England.

He will then be presented with the Sword of State and declare at the altar: ""The things which I have here before promised, I will perform, and keep. So help me God"", before kissing the Bible and signing the oath.

The third part - the anointing - follows, which is the process of blessing and consecrating the new monarch with holy oil - the central act of the religious ceremony. The King will remove his crimson robe and sit in King Edward's Chair.

Fourthly, the investiture is the official crowning.

It will see the King dressed in special robes and presented with the orb, coronation ring, sceptre and rod.

Sitting in King Edward's Chair, he will be crowned with St Edward's Crown before the congregation shouts out ""God Save the King"".

Image: The Queen carries the orb and sceptre during her coronation ceremony in 1953

This is followed by the enthroning, which will see the monarch lifted onto a different throne by archbishops, bishops and ""other peers of the kingdom"".

The final stage of the King's coronation is known as homage.

It sees the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Prince of Wales and other royal blood princes paying tribute to the King by placing their hands between his and kissing his right hand.

Image: Queen Elizabeth II wears St Edward's Crown

Camilla to be crowned

The Queen Consort will then also be crowned.

Unlike the wives of Kings, the husbands of Queens do not become King Consorts and are therefore not crowned.

But ahead of her Platinum Jubilee, the Queen announced Camilla would be known as Queen Consort on King Charles's accession.

Instead the Duke of Edinburgh ""paid homage"" to Queen Elizabeth II immediately after the formal coronation - as Prince William and other princes are likely to do this time.

The Queen Mother was anointed and crowned during her husband's coronation in 1937.

According to the Royal Family's website: ""A Queen consort is crowned with the King, in a similar but simpler ceremony.""

The coronation concert

On Sunday, the day after the coronation, ""global music icons and contemporary stars"" descend on Windsor Castle for the coronation concert.

Thousands of members of the public will be selected to receive a pair of free tickets, which are up for grabs through a national ballot held by the BBC, which will also broadcast the event live.

The ""world's biggest entertainers"" and world-class orchestras will be supported by a selection of dancers and spoken word sequences delivered by stars of stage and screen.

The Coronation Choir will also perform, created from members of the nation's community choirs and amateur singers such as refugee choirs, NHS choirs and LGBTQ+ singing groups, in part to make the weekend feel as inclusive and diverse as possible.

162;As Roe v Wade marks 50 years, what's changed since the landmark abortion decision was overturned?;Sunday 22 January 2023 06:41, UK;[];['abortion', 'roe v wade', 'usa'];['v', 'abortion', 'whats', 'decision', 'clinics', 'roe', 'states', 'changed', 'marks', 'court', 'abortions', 'overturned', 'wade', 'bans', 'rights', 'landmark'];"Today marks 50 years since Roe v Wade, America's landmark Supreme Court decision that enshrined abortion as a constitutional right.

Roe v Wade was overturned last June, giving the power to decide on abortion rights to 50 states to determine individually.

It triggered a wave of change. Abortion bans were brought in, court cases mounted, clinics closed. Here is what has happened in the seven months since US abortion rights were overturned.

First off, what is Roe v Wade?

Roe v Wade refers to the 1973 Supreme Court case that said the government could not prohibit abortions because the constitutional right to liberty includes the right to decide whether to continue a pregnancy.

Roe refers to Texan woman Norma McCorvey - known by the pseudonym Jane Roe - who challenged the state’s abortion laws after she couldn’t get a termination in 1969 because her life was not in danger. Wade is district attorney Henry Wade, who defended the anti-abortion laws.

The court decision meant every woman in the US had the right to an abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Another ruling - Planned Parenthood v Casey in 1982 - built on that by saying states could not have laws that create a ""substantial obstacle"" to a woman seeking an abortion up to 24 weeks.

States ban abortion

In 12 states, there are now near-total bans on abortion. In five of these states, the ban is being challenged in court but remains in effect.

The 12 states are: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.

Two further states - North Dakota and Wisconsin - do not have bans in place but abortions are unavailable because clinics have closed.

Georgia has banned abortions past six weeks of pregnancy, severely limiting access to terminations because so many women do not find out they are pregnant - and have time to organise the procedure - before the six-week mark.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, which specialises in reproductive health, these 15 states are home to almost 22 million women aged 15 to 49. That means almost a third of America’s women of reproductive age are living in states where abortion is either unavailable or severely restricted.

More states could follow

A further nine states have introduced restrictions to abortion that would have been unconstitutional under Roe v Wade, have bans currently blocked by the court or are likely to introduce bans in the near future.

Arizona and Florida do not allow abortions past 15 weeks, while Utah has an 18-week ban.

In three states - Indiana, Wyoming and Ohio - near-total or early-gestation bans have been blocked by state courts for now, but lawmakers have indicated they intend to fight them.

In Iowa, Montana and Nebraska, anti-abortion policymakers have indicated that they want to ban abortion soon, but abortion care remains available for now.

What's happened to abortion clinics?

At least 66 abortion clinics have stopped offering abortion care in the 15 states where abortion is banned or severely restricted.

The loss of these clinics is felt nationwide, according to the Guttmacher Institute, as clinics in states where abortion remains legal are inundated with people travelling interstate.

As the institute explains: ""These dramatic increases in caseloads mean clinic capacity and staff are stretched to their limits, resulting in longer wait times for appointments even for residents of states where abortion remains legal.""

A study from the Society of Family Planning estimated legal abortions nationwide fell by more than 10,000 in the two months following the overturning of Roe v Wade, although some women may have sought abortion pills privately.

Exacerbating inequality

Many of the states that have banned or restricted abortion have high proportions of black, Latina and indigenous women.

Research by the Kaiser Family Foundation revealed how overturning Roe v Wade disproportionately impacts women of colour, as they are more likely to get abortions, have more limited access to health care, and face barriers to travelling out of state for an abortion.

The Guttmacher Institute notes in addition that ""people living with low incomes... transmen and nonbinary people, immigrants, adolescents and people living with disabilities are all particularly likely to encounter compounding obstacles to abortion care and be harmed as a result"".

Some states have introduced protections

While the US has seen significant rolling back of abortion rights, there are pockets of good news for pro-choice activists.

Voters in Kansas protected abortion rights in the state’s constitution by rejecting an amendment that would have allowed lawmakers to restrict access to abortions.

New York will provide free abortion pills at four public clinics, making its health department the first in the nation to offer free medication abortion.

In the midterms, voters in five states chose to protect reproductive rights. Vermont, Michigan and California added protections to their state constitutions while voters in Kentucky rejected an amendment that would have removed any protection for abortion rights from the constitution.

In Montana, a bill that could have criminalised doctors for providing abortions was defeated.

Medical abortions

Medical abortions account for the majority of abortions in the US - in 2020, the most recent year for which data is available, abortion pills were used in 53% of cases.

Early evidence suggests they have become even more popular since Roe v Wade was overturned - one study suggested the number of people seeking medical abortions has increased threefold.

At the beginning of January, the Food and Drug Administration changed its rules to allow retail pharmacies in the US to dispense abortion pills for the first time.

However, abortion pills are now seen as the next frontier in the fight by anti-abortion activists and they are pushing hard to curtail access.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230122074716/http://news.sky.com/story/as-roe-v-wade-marks-50-years-whats-changed-since-the-landmark-abortion-decision-was-overturned-12791122

The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for fog covering much of England, including Yorkshire, the South East and the Midlands.

Travellers should plan for slower journey times by car, possible disruption to bus and train services and a chance of delayed or cancelled flights, forecasters said.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned pollution would intensify on Sunday as cold, foggy conditions trap in emissions from cars and vans that burn fossil fuels.

""On Sunday, alongside the extreme cold temperatures we've been experiencing, we are also expecting moderate to high levels of air pollution,"" he said.

The mayor has issued a ""moderate"" air pollution alert.

Air pollution increases the risk of respiratory infections, heart disease and lung cancer and tends to hit those who are already ill, children the elderly and poor people, according to the World Health Organisation.

The mayor urged Londoners to ""look after each other by choosing to walk, cycle or take public transport, avoiding unnecessary car journeys, stopping engine idling and not burning wood or garden waste, all of which contributes to high levels of pollution"".

""This is particularly important in order to protect those who are more vulnerable,"" he added.

The warning tops off an extremely cold week, when temperatures plunged below -10C in parts of the UK amid snow and icy conditions.

But Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell said the worst of the cold snap is over, with warmer temperatures on the way next week across the whole of the UK.

Mr Snell said: ""Next week, looking at the severe front, it's looking pretty benign.

""We're starting to lose the risk of fog and temperatures are generally around where they should be.

""We'll probably lose the really hard frosts. In terms of ice and snow, it certainly looks like we're over the worst.

""We've got to keep an eye on risk of fog generally this cold spell, although the main hazards from it look like they are beginning to diminish.""

The change will come as the Arctic blast that swept across the UK in the past five days gives way to warmer air from the Atlantic, but will take longer to reach southern areas.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230122074716/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-weather-freezing-fog-warning-across-much-of-england-as-conditions-trigger-air-pollution-alert-for-london-12792265

Former Love Island star Dyer first shared the news on Instagram, along with a series of photos, including one which showed two baby scans.

The 26-year-old already has a son - Santiago who is nearly two years old - with her ex-boyfriend Sammy Kimmence.

In her post, she wrote: ""Our little TWINS… So excited to meet our babies and watch Santi be the best big brother.

""The biggest surprise of our lives but feeling SO blessed… Our family is getting a lot bigger and we can't wait.""

While she did not share her due date, it is likely the babies are due in the summer.

Celebrity friends were quick to congratulate the couple, with former Love Island winner Molly Mae, who is also pregnant, writing: ""Omg!!! Amazing. Congratulations.""

Zara McDermott, who appeared with Dyer on Love Island in 2018, said: ""Congratulations darling this is amazing news!!!!! Twins!!!!""

Sophy Ridge on Sunday is on now, with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly first up to talk to us.

With the Conservative Party facing questions this morning, Sophy asks whether he was tempted to pull out.

Mr Cleverly chuckles and says: ""I am the face and voice of the UK on the international stage and I'm very pleased to come on your show.""

Moving onto the serious questions, Sophy brings up the allegations this morning that BBC chairman Richard Sharp helped former prime minister Boris Johnson arrange a guarantee for a loan - and that Mr Johnson later recommended Mr Sharp for the role of BBC chair.

She asks whether this is true - to which Mr Cleverly says he has ""not had a conversation with either of those parties"".

He describes Mr Sharp as ""an incredibly competent, experienced, thoughtful individual"" and says he ""can see why he has attributes... to be chair of the BBC"".

Sophy then questions why Mr Cleverly has not got in contact with Mr Johnson to ask about the allegations ahead of appearing on the programme.

""I'm sure you've got his number too,"" Mr Cleverly says - to which Sophy says she doesn't.

The foreign secretary continues to say that Mr Sharp has a ""wealth of experience"" and therefore would have been right for the role of BBC chair, but he is not aware of the details of the alleged arrangement between Mr Sharp and Mr Johnson.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230122084720/http://news.sky.com/story/politics-latest-cabinet-minister-facing-questions-over-boris-johnson-sleaze-allegations-on-sophy-ridge-on-sunday-12593360
166;Fireworks, family reunions and hazmat suits - how China is celebrating the Lunar New Year;Sunday 22 January 2023 08:17, UK;['helen-ann smith', '@helenannsmith0'];['covid-19', 'china'];['fireworks', 'lunar', 'worried', 'unclear', 'celebrating', 'holiday', 'hazmat', 'suits', 'yin', 'wave', 'peak', 'reunions', 'family', 'china', 'traditional', 'wasnt', 'disease'];"The Lunar New Year holiday has been described as the largest migration of people on the planet.

This year, many families will be reunited after nearly three years of strict zero-COVID curbs on travel.

At Beijing station many came laden with gifts, others were still taking extreme precautions, we saw one family dressed in full white hazmat suits.

What is the Lunar New Year - and what does the Year of the Rabbit signify?

Official statistics say 110 million people have travelled by train in the two weeks leading up to the New Year holiday, but the station wasn't quite as busy as might be expected – perhaps an indication that COVID is still rife here.

Indeed, this country has been hit by a huge wave of infections after rules were abruptly dropped in December.

The chief epidemiologist at China Center for Disease Control has said 80% of the population has already caught the virus.

For those who've recovered, reunions are relished.

Luna Li and her toddler Annie were travelling to see their family for the first time in a year.

""I think to see the family is more important than getting worried about being sick again."" she said.

""It's been three years, it's really a long time, we want to get our life normal again.""

Image: Luna Li and her toddler Annie

'The peak won't come again'

We travelled with her and others by train to Shandong province, which is home to the highest number of elderly people in the country.

There is still fear about the virus being transported to places like this, even President Xi has said in the last few days he is worried about further rural spread.

And it's villages like Da Gu on the line. Small rural places with small rudimentary facilities.

It's a picturesque place, surrounded by hills with quiet streets and traditional homes, but one tiny clinic is the only medical resource.

The doctor told us she wasn't worried though.

""The epidemic has already passed. The peak will not come again,"" she said.

""Most people have recovered. Only those with underlying diseases are not very good.""

More than 12,000 dead in a week

As dusk fell, people bought out boxes of paper money to burn in the street - a traditional practice on New Year's Eve to honour the dead.

COVID means there are more to remember this year. More than 12,000 people died of the disease just last week, according to authorities.

The total number is unclear, but some modelling suggests this wave could claim more than a million lives.

However, for many families, it's just a joy to be able to be together again.

Three generations of the Yin family gathered to eat traditional food, honour their ancestors and celebrate with fireworks.

Over dinner, the head of the family Yin Hexin reflected on how the worst is now behind them.

""Some elderly died, those with issues already, heart disease or something else. Others are fine,"" he said.

""We don't care much, normalisation or not, it feels like a cold.""

It's unclear if the holiday will spark something bigger, or if the peak of this wave has truly passed.

But for many, for now, it just feels like a much longed for release.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230122084720/http://news.sky.com/story/fireworks-family-reunions-and-hazmat-suits-how-china-is-celebrating-the-lunar-new-year-12792549

The president of the European Council has pushed back against suggestions Ukraine's counteroffensive has failed.

It has been broadly accepted the much-anticipated counteroffensive did not achieve as much as was hoped, but Ukraine has insisted it is not in a stalemate.

Speaking to the Kyiv Independent, Charles Michel appeared to agree with Ukraine's view and said the counteroffensive had not failed.

""Two examples. Firstly, how the Ukrainian army made huge progress in the Black Sea is extremely important. This is a major step in the right direction,"" he said.

""Secondly, the recent progress made on the left side of the River Dnipro is also very important.""

He also said helping Ukraine to join the European Union is a ""question of moral duty"".

Mr Michel, who was in Ukraine earlier this week, was asked about accession talks and what the main roadblocks might be.

He said it was his goal to ""do everything to make a positive decision possible"" while admitting that achieving unanimity in the council is ""always challenging"".

However, he said it was ""very important to give a very strong signal"" because it is a ""question of moral duty"".

He added: ""Ukrainians are fighting for our common democratic values and principles.

Here's a quick reminder of the topics that are likely to come up in today's show.

Nadhim Zahawi's tax affairs

The Tory chairman - and former chancellor - has been facing questions after a report in The Sun on Sunday claimed he had to make a seven-figure tax payment following ""scrutiny of his family's financial affairs"".

In a statement yesterday, Mr Zahawi said his tax error was found to be ""careless and not deliberate"".

He said his father took founder shares in YouGov and that HMRC later ""disagreed about the exact allocation"", leading him to ""settle the matter and pay what they said was due"".

Mr Zahawi added: ""So that I could focus on my life as a public servant, I chose to settle the matter and pay what they said was due, which was the right thing to do.""

Still, Labour has called for the Tory MP to be sacked.

Rishi Sunak's seatbelt debacle

Also facing questions is the prime minister, who received a fixed penalty notice after being seen in a video not wearing a seatbelt.

Lancashire Police issued the notice after Rishi Sunak appeared without a belt in a clip on Instagram as he promoted his levelling-up funding in Lancashire.

Mr Sunak has accepted the fine, with Downing Street saying he ""fully accepts this was a mistake"" and will ""of course comply with the fixed penalty"".

Industrial action

Months of strikes are putting increasing pressure on the government.

Over this winter, strikes have been ongoing among nurses, bus drivers, ambulance staff, civil servants, teachers and Environment Agency staff.

Tens of thousands of workers are staging walkouts in the coming months, with no resolution found for many of these sectors.

The war in Ukraine

The conflict appears to be at a critical point, with both Russia and Ukraine plotting offensives in the coming months.

Ukraine has been calling on its Western allies to provide more modern weaponry so it can push Russia out of its territory.

The UK will send 14 Challenger 2 tanks, but allies failed to reach an agreement on sending German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine - while the US is also refusing to provide its Abrams tanks.

The two-part programme - India: The Modi Question - questions Mr Modi's leadership during the 2002 Gujarat riots.

The first episode was broadcast in the UK on Tuesday, and while it did not air in India, content was shared online, according to government advisor Kanchan Gupta.

He said the government had issued orders to both YouTube and Twitter to block content, using legislation under the country's information and technology rules. He said both social media companies had complied.

Last week, a spokesperson for India's foreign ministry termed the BBC documentary a ""propaganda piece"" meant to push a ""discredited narrative"".

India is the largest democracy in the world. The country has two main religious groups, with Hindus making up around 80% of the population and Muslims around 14% of the population, according to a 2011 census.

Mr Modi has served as India's prime minister since 2014, and is currently serving his second term after his re-election in 2019.

However, his decade-long premiership has been dogged by persistent allegations about the attitude of his government towards India's Muslim population.

He was the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat when it was gripped by riots that left more than 1,000 people dead, according to official numbers, most of them Muslims.

The violence erupted after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims caught fire, killing 59.

Human rights activists estimate at least double that number died in the rioting.

Mr Modi denied accusations that he failed to stop the rioting.

A special investigation team appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate the role of Mr Modi and others in the violence said in a 541-page report in 2012 that it could find no evidence to prosecute the-then chief minister.

He was later named the head of his party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which he led to power.

The attack happened after one of the biggest Lunar New Year festivals in southern California, where ""large crowds"" had been enjoying music and food stalls.

Kelner says that event officially ended at 9pm, with the first report to police occurring at about 10pm.

Reports have emerged of multiple victims and multiple fatalities, but nothing is confirmed yet.

175;Ministers accused of having 'sinister reason' for 'not doing a deal' with nurses;Sunday 22 January 2023 11:06, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];"['nhs', ""nurses' strike""]";['reason', 'deal', 'doing', 'looking', 'having', 'nurses', 'sunak', 'privatise', 'secretary', 'talks', 'accused', 'graham', 'pay', 'ministers', 'sinister', 'nhs'];"The head of the UK's second biggest union has accused the government of having a ""sinister reason"" for ""not doing a deal"" with nurses to end their strike action.

Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, said the government is looking to privatise the NHS, which is why it ""won't come to the table"", and she claimed ministers were ""pretending"" that pay negotiations were going on.

It comes as NHS leaders are making contingency plans with the biggest walkout in the health service's history looming.

Ambulance staff and nurses are both set to go on strike on 6 February - taking industrial action on the same day for the first time ever.

Ms Graham told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: ""This employer, being the government, is not interested in doing a deal as far as the NHS is concerned.

""I have to say we are concluding now that there must be a much more sinister reason for this because this level of self-harm is unprecedented.""

Asked what the reason could be, Ms Graham said: ""I think that they are looking to privatise the NHS. Genuinely, I believe that they're looking at this as the moment they can privatise the NHS.""

She also said that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was ""missing in action"".

""Now, it's either that Rishi Sunak is not up to this job, that he doesn't want to come into the negotiating room and to do this deal or there must be another reason as to why he's allowing this self-harm to happen to the NHS.""

Government 'doesn't want a resolution'

In perhaps her most scathing comments yet, Ms Graham said she believes it is ""deliberate"" that the government is ""drawing out"" talks.

She accused the government of ""lying"" on a number of issues, adding that she does not use this word lightly.

Image: Unite union general secretary Sharon Graham has spoken to Sky News

The alleged lies include ambulance workers not covering minimum safety levels during disputes, and that the government is continuing with talks.

""They are being disingenuous by pretending that there are talks going on about pay,"" she said. ""There are absolutely no talks going on about pay. Every general secretary will tell you that.""

She added she is ""negotiating with somebody at the moment that I don't think wants resolution"".

Health Secretary Steve Barclay has ruled out a 10% pay rise for nurses - insisting it was ""not affordable"".

He warned this would amount to an additional £3.6bn a year that would take money away from patient services.

Mr Sunak has said his government is ""very keen to have a constructive dialogue"" with unions across the public sector - and stressed talks are ongoing to find a way of bringing strikes to an end.

He added: ""But we do also need to make sure that those conversations are based on what's reasonable, what's responsible for the country as we tackle inflation, which is good for everybody if we can get that down as quickly as possible.""

Within three days of Uvalde, 1,500 miles north, in Michigan, there was another mass shooting.

A domestic this time; a mother, Dawn Gillard, and her three children shot dead.

It made the local news but not much more because here in America events like this are unremarkable.

The frigid cold of Michigan feels a long way from Texas.

But in the second floor apartment of a block in a town on Lake Michigan I met a man whose words and grief and anger felt so similar to the pain I'd felt in Texas.

""Well, Dawn was a bright soul. I would say she always seemed to want to support other people. She's always been that person that would show up.""

""And her three children, Caitlyn, Ronald and Joshua… Yeah, I would say they were the sun in her life. They were what she was most proud of. Her kids.""

Randy Myers is Dawn's cousin.

He wouldn't mention by name the father of the three children - the man accused of the killings.

""There wouldn't be four family members dead, right? Without that gun.""

But, holding back tears, he wanted to talk about guns.

""I don't own a gun. I don't find a need for a gun. I feel pretty strongly that the guns in this country, it seems to be that we, as people, seem to utilise them as a crutch to deal with our mismanaged emotions,"" Randy said.

""It was a domestic violence situation. And so that, that was, that was his crutch. And if that gun wasn't there, maybe Dawn would have been injured… the outcome would have been different.""

Then a revelation which, for me, cut to the heart of the everyday banality of gun violence in America.

Randy explained how he had seen the story of the shooting online, hours before he was told about it, but took no notice. He hadn't realised it concerned his own family.

""I scrolled past that story... I stopped, I read the headline and I just kept scrolling. It didn't have her name or anything like that. And I just scrolled past it,"" he said, sobbing.

The official website of the Brazilian armed forces said General Julio Cesar de Arruda had been removed as head of the army.

He has been replaced by General Tomas Miguel Ribeiro Paiva, who was head of the Southeast Military Command.

Around 1,500 people have been detained after the invasion of Brazil's congress, presidential palace and supreme court at the start of January.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:10 How Brazil's insurrection unfolded

Rioters were seeking military intervention to either restore the far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro or oust the newly inaugurated leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, who won the election with just 50.9% of the votes.

Supporters of the former president stormed through government buildings and destroyed public property.

Mr Lula said several times in public that there were definitely people in the army who allowed the rioting to occur.

Similarities to 6 January 2021 Congress riots

The riot bore strong similarities to the 6 January 2021 riots at the US Congress by mobs who wanted to overturn former president Donald Trump's election loss to Joe Biden.

Mr Lula met defence minister Jose Mucio, chief of staff Rui Costa, and the new army commander in Brasilia later on Saturday.

Speaking afterwards, Mr Mucio said the 8 January riots had caused ""a fracture in the level of trust"" in the army's top levels and the government decided a change was needed.

Agreeing to a request by federal prosecutors, Justice Alexandre de Moraes stated: ""Public figures who continue to cowardly conspire against democracy trying to establish a state of exception will be held accountable.""

Customers have been reporting steep price increases across a number of items from Royal Canin - with one saying her food had increased by £15 for a 10kg bag in less than a year.

Zooplus, an online pet food seller that stocks Royal Canin - among other brands - said it did not want to pass these price increases on to its customers, branding them ""excessive"", and saying ""value for money is important to us"".

The German retailer explained that people may find it difficult to buy Royal Canin products from its site and it has limited the number of items each household can purchase.

A notice now appears above all Royal Canin items on the site saying: ""Dear customers, the manufacturer Royal Canin has communicated a price increase for its brands, which in our opinion is excessive.

""We do not want to pass on this price increase to you and your pet. Because of this we will have difficulty sourcing their full portfolio and likely start experiencing higher out of stock on Royal Canin products.

""Therefore, we can only offer Royal Canin products in our shop on a limited basis until further notice. In order to give as many customers as possible the chance to order the available Royal Canin products from our inventory, we have temporarily reduced the normal household quantity per purchase for Royal Canin products.""

It then offers customers 10% off a number of Royal Canin's competitors, saying they are ""comparable alternatives up to 20% less expensive"".

""We will never compromise on the quality of our nutritional solutions. Whilst in-store prices continue to be at the sole discretion of retailers, we continue to work hard on behalf of our customers to mitigate increases.

The man currently in the top role, Richard Sharp, allegedly helped Boris Johnson secure a loan guarantee before being recommended for the job.

Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell has written to the Commissioner for Public Appointments, William Shawcross CVO, asking him to investigate the appointment process.

Labour has already reported Mr Johnson to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards following the report in the Sunday Times, which his spokesperson described as ""rubbish"".

Mr Sharp has also denied a conflict of interest, but calls for clarity are growing after Foreign Secretary James Cleverly evaded answers on the story during media rounds this morning.

Ms Powell said the BBC is meant to be impartial and ""it is vital that the public and parliament can have trust in the process and it is free from any real or perceived conflict of interest"".

""Accordingly, I urge you to investigate this process, and satisfy the public and parliament of its integrity,"" she said in her letter.

The Sunday Times reported Mr Sharp, a Tory donor, was involved in arranging a guarantor on a loan of up to £800,000 for Mr Johnson in late 2020.

Mr Sharp told the newspaper he had ""simply connected"" people and there was no conflict of interest, while Mr Johnson's spokesman insisted his financial arrangements ""have been properly declared"".

Lord Kerslake, the former head of the Civil Service, told Sky News there should be an independent investigation into the claims - either through a parliamentary select committee or by the prime minister's new ethics adviser - so the facts can be ""completely established"".

""The position of the chairman of the BBC is an enormously important one for the country and you want the process for appointing a new person to be absolutely squeaky clean,"" he said.

Earlier, cabinet minister James Cleverly defended Mr Sharp's appointment, saying he had ""no doubt"" the chairman was given the job based ""on merit"".

Labour has called for the cabinet minister to be sacked after he admitted paying a settlement to HMRC following a tax error related to a shareholding in YouGov.

Mr Zahawi released a statement on Saturday to ""address some of the confusion about my finances"", but it raised further questions, including whether he negotiated the dispute while he was serving as chancellor in the closing days of the Johnson administration.

On Sunday morning, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme he didn't know anything more about the situation than what was in his colleague's statement.

""I'm not an investigator,"" he said when it was put to him that he was there to speak on behalf of the government.

Mr Zahawi has not disclosed the size of the settlement - reported to be an estimated £4.8m including a 30% penalty - or confirm whether he paid a fine.

Asked whether he should reveal this information, Mr Cleverly said: ""People's taxes are private matters. I know that as politicians we, quite rightly, are expected to have a higher level of disclosure than perhaps other people might do.

""Nadhim has issued a statement where he has admitted that he made a careless error, this is now resolved.""

However, senior backbencher and former Tory leader Sir Iain took a different view.

""The sooner you can get the facts out the better, rather than have them coming out in phases,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show.

""I would say to him, get it all out now, whatever you have to do, and clear it up.""

He added: ""I don't believe he is deceitful in any way.""

Reports about Mr Zahawi's tax affairs began emerging when he was appointed chancellor by Mr Johnson last summer.

He denied allegations that he avoided tax by using an offshore company registered in Gibraltar to hold shares in the YouGov polling company he co-founded.

Questions swirled following an article in The Sun on Sunday last week, which claimed a seven-figure payment was made by Mr Zahawi to end a dispute with the taxman ""after scrutiny of his family's financial affairs"".

In his statement last night, Mr Zahawi said his father took founder shares in YouGov and that HMRC later ""disagreed about the exact allocation"", leading him to ""settle the matter and pay what they said was due"".

Mr Zahawi said he made a ""careless and not deliberate error"", but opposition parties have demanded an independent investigation as well as the publication of all of Mr Zahawi's correspondence with HMRC.

But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury cast doubt on this.

Pat McFadden said: ""It's difficult for Mr Zahawi because the problem with this is what we're being asked to believe.

""We're being asked to believe that he had this asset worth £27m that he didn't really know was his, and therefore didn't really know tax was due on it.""

He said that ""maybe all politicians"" should publish their tax returns - a view shared by former shadow chancellor John McDonnell.

'Test' for Rishi Sunak

Mr McFadden also said the matter is a ""test"" of Mr Sunak's promise to turn a new leaf after Boris Johnson's scandal-plagued premiership, suggesting his pledge would be undermined ""if this is just shrugged off"".

It is not clear what the prime minister knew when he appointed Mr Zahawi as party chairman.

Mr Cleverly suggested the PM does not discuss ministers' ""external affairs"" during appointments and that it is the Cabinet Office's role to conduct due diligence on his behalf.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230122153236/http://news.sky.com/story/former-tory-leader-urges-nadhim-zahawi-to-clear-up-questions-over-tax-affairs-12792720

Sky News understands that Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia will on Monday be unveiled as chair of Moneyfarm.

Dame Jayne-Anne's appointment will ignite speculation that Moneyfarm, which is backed by the asset management group M&G; Investments, is preparing the ground for a stock market listing.

Launched in 2012, Moneyfarm has about £2.5bn of assets under management, and roughly 90,000 active investors as customers.

Among its other shareholders are Poste Italiane, the Italian postal service, and Allianz Asset Management.

The Moneyfarm chairmanship adds to Dame Jayne-Anne's portfolio of roles, which includes chairing HM Revenue & Customs and Snoop, a money-saving app she founded and runs.

Her role steering Virgin Money towards and through its initial public offering is likely to have been of particular interest to Moneyfarm's founders and board.

""Moneyfarm has a clear vision and strategy to deliver this and reminds me very much of my early days at Virgin Money,"" she said.

""It has the same energy, drive and innovative culture, with a diverse client base and business that encourages everyone to take control of their financial future.""

Giovanni Daprà, one of Moneyfarm's co-founders and its chief executive, said: ""When we were looking for a new Chair, we wanted to appoint someone with significant expertise in the financial services sector that had a proven track record of delivering high levels of corporate governance and stakeholder engagement in a highly regulated and fast-growing industry.""

The duchess was one of many paying tribute to the star on the front lawn at Graceland Mansion in Memphis, Tennessee on Sunday.

For years the sprawling estate has been the destination for those paying tribute to Elvis, but following her death on 12 January aged 54, the iconic home has become the venue for those saying a final farewell to his daughter.

Lisa Marie suffered a cardiac arrest at her home in Calabasas, California, dying aged 54.

Two days before her death, she had appeared with her mother, Priscilla Presley, at the Golden Globes.

As well as family and friends, members of the public were invited to attend the service, which was also livestreamed.

The event kicked off with a powerful rendition of Amazing Grace performed by Jason Clark and The Tennessee Mass Choir, dressed in black, flanked by a photo of Lisa Marie.

Filmmaker Joel Weinshanker began the service, saying he hoped they could honour Lisa Marie's wishes ""not to be sad"", and was followed to the lectern by Pastor Dwayne Hunt who paid tribute to her ""passion, strength, brilliance and tenaciousness"".

In his tribute, former Mayor of Memphis, AC Wharton, listed many famous celebrity parents, including Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan, and Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet, Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, he went on: ""Before Jay-Z and Beyonce had Blue Ivy, and long before Prince Harry and Meghan had Archie, right here, in this city, our own royal couple, Elvis and Priscilla, had a beautiful bundle of joy, named Lisa Marie...

""Fifty-four years ago there was a star shining over Graceland with the birth of this precious angel."" He said she was inseparably a part of Memphis, calling her ""a precious jewel"", and a ""sister"" to everyone who lived there.

He concluded: ""Lisa Marie was all Memphis. She belonged to us and we belonged to her.""

Sarah, Duchess of York, then took to the stand, speaking about the Queen in her tribute and offering her support to the late singer's children.

She said: ""We need to stoke our flames within to celebrate extraordinary Lisa Marie. I stand here with great honour, because we called each other Sissie. I've been here with you all for all your lives and I stand here with great honour. So Sissie, this is for you with affection.""

She went on to tell an anecdote about the Queen, saying: ""My late mother-in-law used to say 'That nothing can be said, can begin to take away the anguish and the pain of these moments because grief is the price we pay for love', and how right she was.""

A tearful Priscilla Presley then read out a poem written by her granddaughter about her mother's loss, titled The Old Soul. She finished her reading, saying: ""Our heart is broken Lisa, we all love you"".

Elvis is also buried at Graceland, as are Elvis's parents, his paternal grandmother, and his grandson Benjamin Keough - Lisa Marie's son - who took his own life in 2020, aged 27.

Lisa Marie's final resting place is next to her son and near to her father.

Elvis died from heart failure aged 42 when Lisa Marie was aged just nine. She was four when Elvis and Priscilla Presley were divorced in 1972.

Lisa Marie was married four times, including to pop star Michael Jackson and actor Nicolas Cage.

She had struggled with opioid addiction following the birth of her twin daughters in 2008.

Just months before her death she wrote in an essay for People magazine: ""I've dealt with death, grief and loss since the age of nine years old.

""I've had more than anyone's fair share of it in my lifetime and somehow, I've made it this far.""

She went on: ""Death is part of life whether we like it or not - and so is grieving.""

The 61-year-old was speaking from a Florida prison, where she is serving a 20-year sentence after being found guilty of luring young girls to massage rooms for disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein to molest between 1994 and 2004.

The disgraced British socialite has previously cast doubt on the authenticity of the photo, said to be taken inside her Mayfair home, and showing her smiling in the background.

Clips released ahead of an interview with TalkTV show her saying: ""It's a fake. I don't believe it's real for a second, in fact I'm sure it's not.""

She goes on: ""Well, there's never been an original and further there's no photograph, and I've only ever seen a photocopy of it.""

Prince Andrew has also questioned the authenticity of the image of him with Ms Giuffre and has said he's ""not one to hug"" or ""display affection"" in public.

Ms Giuffre - formerly known as Virginia Roberts - used the image as evidence to support her allegations against the prince before the case was settled outside of court.

The duke - who paid millions to settle the civil sexual assault case - is now looking into ways to overturn the settlement, according to reports in The Sun on Sunday and Mail on Sunday.

He denies all claims and says he has never met Ms Giuffre.

Image: Maxwell with Jeffrey Epstein

Ms Giuffre sued the duke for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was 17 after she was trafficked by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the former partner of Maxwell.

Epstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.

In an interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019, Andrew said while he recognises himself in the picture, he claimed it is not possible to prove whether the image had been faked.

He also said the picture could not have been taken in London, as he was wearing his ""travelling clothes"".

Ms Giuffre told BBC Panorama the photo was ""authentic"" and said she gave the original to the FBI in 2011.

Maxwell originally cast doubt on the authenticity of the photo in a deposition.

She said the surroundings in the photo looked ""familiar"", but also said: ""We can't really establish the photograph and all that"", adding: ""I don't know if that's true, if that's a real picture or not.""

As you approach, the rumbling percussion of artillery echoes all around - it's the sound of a coming storm.

The first thing that draws your eye is the smoke from shelling in the centre, spiralling up against a bruised skyline.

Russia's advance is choking routes into this desperate place, which is at the epicentre of this war.

We travelled on one of the remaining roads in.

It's a sketchy, nervous journey along smashed-up streets.

Everywhere here is in the line of fire.

We see devastated shops, apartment blocks and even churches.

And the casualties on both sides have been staggering.

The Kremlin has outsourced the fight here to the Wagner paramilitary group - they've sent wave after wave of infantry to try and capture this once thriving industrial hub.

It is also becoming clear that this gruelling fight, which began in August, is morphing into urban combat.

A David and Goliath battle of wits

Inside the city, we saw Ukrainian forces laying traps and bringing in reinforcements.

Lines of Soviet-era tanks and armoured vehicles are concealed amongst the buildings.

Dymytro, a soldier from the Azov brigade, tells me the fight has become a David and Goliath battle of wits.

""We are holding for now. We are standing with machine guns against tanks and we will see. As long as we have the spirit to fight, we will fight!"" he says as gunfire rings out.

This city has become a symbolic prize for Russia, although it appears to be of small strategic value.

There are still a few people who are trying to salvage their belongings but most have left.

We watch a group of men taking stock - microwaves and refrigerators - from their shop.

Those remaining are terrified and reliant on the aid handouts from volunteers.

Iryna says she stays because she has nowhere else.

""People go to Dnipro and they shell Dnipro too, people died there, they hide there and there was a strike and people died, where should we go? It can land anywhere in Ukraine.""

""We need weapons today because after tomorrow this city can be destroyed already and if we wait, I can die but I want to live, and I want to support my country.

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star announced in an Instagram post that her 11-month-old son, who she shares with rapper Travis Scott, is now called Aire.

Originally given the name Wolf Webster, the couple decided to change it because they ""didn't really feel like it was him"" back in March last year.

Since then, his identity has been kept under wraps – his face hasn't even appeared in an episode of The Kardashians.

Alongside sharing his name, Jenner also showed a series of photos where she could be seen in a khaki zip-up hoodie while holding Aire, who is wearing a shark-patterned onesie.

Other images show Jenner holding him on her hip, a snap of him sitting on a sofa while sporting a beanie, and a snap of him in a high chair with food on his face and bib.

She simply captioned the post: ""Aire"" with a white heart emoji.

The news ends months of speculation by fans, who have poured over clips of the hit Disney+ show in the hopes of finding a slip-up revealing his name.

Back in September, people believed Jenner's niece, True, accidentally shared his name during a phone call where she called him Snowy – but that theory can now be put to bed.

Jenner rose to fame alongside her Kardashian-Jenner siblings on their reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians which came to an end in June 2021 after 14 years and 20 seasons of the show.

The former prime minister said it was a ""privilege"" to be invited to the war-torn nation by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with whom he had a close working relationship during his time in office.

Downing Street indicated Rishi Sunak was ""supportive"" of the visit, after claims it could undermine his authority on foreign policy.

Ukraine war latest: Putin ally warns West against weapons deliveries

Mr Johnson was pictured visiting Borodianka near Kyiv - a town heavily damaged by the Russian invasion.

In a statement, Mr Johnson said: ""The suffering of the people of Ukraine has gone on for too long.

""The only way to end this war is for Ukraine to win - and to win as fast as possible. This is the moment to double down and to give the Ukrainians all the tools they need to finish the job.""

A spokesperson for Mr Johnson added that he fully supports UK Government policy on Ukraine, including the recent decision to send Challenger 2 tanks.

The ex-prime minister pitched himself as a key ally of Kyiv during his time in Number 10, providing support and calling on Western allies to follow suit in the early days of Russia's invasion last February.

As his scandal-plagued premiership unravelled, Mr Johnson was accused of using trips to Ukraine or phone calls with Mr Zelenskyy as a distraction for crises at home.

This trip comes amid allegations BBC chairman Richard Sharp helped the former prime minister arrange a guarantee for a loan - and that Mr Johnson later recommended Mr Sharp for the role of BBC chair.

Mr Johnson's spokesperson denied the report as ""rubbish"", but Labour has called for independent investigations to establish the facts behind the ""murky affair"".

The Guardian reported on Mr Johnson's plans to travel to Ukraine earlier in January.

The National Grid said the three plants - two at Drax's site in North Yorkshire and one at West Burton in Lincolnshire - will not necessarily be needed tomorrow.

But it has asked them to be warmed up and ready to run if required.

The recent cold spell that has brought sub-zero temperatures, freezing fog and snow to swathes of the country is set to continue into next week.

Check the weather forecast where you are

The plants on standby are three of the five coal power stations that were set for retirement, but whose lives were extended through this winter in a bid to boost supplies amid energy security fears.

""This morning we've issued a notification to warm the winter contingency coal units. This measure should give the public confidence in Monday's energy supply,"" the ESO (Electricity System Operator) branch of the National Grid said.

""The ESO as a prudent system operator has these tools for additional contingency to operate the network as normal and the public should continue to use energy as normal.""

In October the ESO warned it was ""likely to be a challenging winter for energy supply throughout Europe"" but said it was planning for a 6.3% margin to ensure reliable electricity supply.

This is the second time this winter that coal plants have been put on standby. They were also warmed up in December when snow blanketed much of the country and energy demand climbed, but they were not eventually needed.

Coal is the most polluting type of fossil fuel, and has been broadly been phased out in the UK as it seeks to cut its greenhouse gas emissions and stave off dangerous levels of climate change.

But ministers in Britain, along with those in Germany and Italy, warned they may be forced to burn more coal after Russian President Vladimir Putin squeezed Europe's gas supplies, sending prices soaring and threatening supplies.

Germany called its decision to fire up old coal plants a ""bitter but necessary"" pill to swallow as it sought to replace Russian gas.

At around 1.10pm (9.10pm UK time) officers searching for a suspect found a body in the driver's seat of a van.

And at a news conference, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna confirmed the body was that of the gunman.

Sheriff Luna said the suspect, 72-year-old Huu Can Tran, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound ""as officers closed in"".

He said when when officers searched the van they recovered ""several pieces of evidence"" related to the Monterey Park scene and a second scene in Alhambra.

A handgun was also recovered.

Police had been searching for a suspect since around 10.20pm on Saturday (6.20am UK time) after the gun attack at a ballroom dance studio in Monterey Park - a city just east of Los Angeles.

At least another 10 people were injured during the incident and were taken to hospital for treatment, with their conditions ranging from critical to stable.

Videos posted online showed officers swarming the area, firefighters attending to injured people and victims on stretchers being put into ambulances.

Sheriff Luna said around 30 minutes later, a man with a gun entered the Lai Lai Ballroom in nearby Alhambra.

The suspect entered the Alhambra club with a gun, and people wrested the weapon away from him before he fled, he added.

It comes after the chancellor was told he can halt industrial action and begin solving the staffing emergency if he comes up with new money to pay health workers ""fairly"".

But Unison warned Jeremy Hunt that if he continues to resist appeals to release extra cash and kickstart talks with unions to end the strikes, the NHS dispute could run for many months.

Its general secretary Christina McAnea said: ""It's simple, all the chancellor needs to do is find the money to pay health workers fairly.

""The public wants the government to end the dispute, so do NHS staff, but most ministers look like they'd rather dig in and do nothing instead of boost pay and help turn the ailing NHS around.

""Higher wages would stop experienced employees leaving for better paid jobs and encourage more people to come and work in the NHS.""

""It's strange that it's the chancellor blocking progress. Jeremy Hunt knows the NHS better than anyone in the cabinet.""

Thousands of members of Unison, Unite and the GMB will walk out across England and Wales.

Unite's general secretary Sharon Graham accused the government of having a ""sinister reason"" for ""not doing a deal"" with nurses to end their strike action.

She told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme: ""This employer, being the government, is not interested in doing a deal as far as the NHS is concerned.

""I have to say we are concluding now that there must be a much more sinister reason for this because this level of self-harm is unprecedented.""

Asked what the reason could be, Ms Graham said: ""I think that they are looking to privatise the NHS.""

Up to 15,000 Unison ambulance workers will strike for the third time in five weeks and will be joined by 5,000 of their NHS colleagues at two hospital trusts in Liverpool.

From 7am, paramedics, emergency care assistants, ambulance technicians, other 999 crew members and control room staff across five services in England - London, Yorkshire, the North West, North East and South West - will join picket lines.

Porters, cleaners, nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants, theatre staff and other NHS workers at the Liverpool University Hospitals Trust and the city's Heart and Chest Hospital will also be out on strike.

Almost 1,000 ambulance workers across the West Midlands in the GMB union will strike, including paramedics and emergency care assistants.

Further strikes are planned in the coming weeks by nurses and other NHS workers.

Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said: ""It is hugely disappointing some ambulance workers are continuing to take industrial action.

""While we have contingency plans in place to mitigate risks to patient safety, there will inevitably be further disruption.

""It is important people continue coming forward for treatment - call 999 in life-threatening emergencies and use NHS 111 online, local pharmacies and GP services for non-life-threatening care.

""I have had constructive talks with unions about this coming year's pay process for 2023/24, and am keen to continue talking about what is affordable and fair.""

It is due to stay in place until March, with 26 energy suppliers including Octopus Energy and EDF signed up to it, but until now has only been used in tests.

A spokesperson added: ""Our forecasts show electricity supply margins are expected to be tighter than normal on Monday evening.

211;World Of Warcraft among top games going offline in China - forcing millions of players to say goodbye;Monday 23 January 2023 03:04, UK;[];['china', 'gaming'];['say', 'offline', 'goodbye', 'deal', 'blizzards', 'blizzard', 'forcing', 'players', 'gaming', 'world', 'millions', 'netease', 'china', 'characters', 'games', 'warcraft', 'going'];"World Of Warcraft, one of the most seminal online games in history, is going offline today in China.

Millions of players will be forced to bid an emotional goodbye to their fantastical characters as a very public fallout between developer Blizzard and publisher NetEase brings a 14-year deal to an end.

Warcraft, which first released in North America in 2004, was initially given permission to launch in the notoriously restrictive Chinese gaming market back in 2005.

Since 2008, Blizzard's massively multiplayer title has had its servers managed in China by NetEase, which also operates bespoke versions of a few other popular Western games like Minecraft.

Blizzard - which is owned by Activision Blizzard, the gaming giant Microsoft is trying to buy in a record $69bn (£56bn) takeover deal - first announced its deal with NetEase would end last November.

It impacts not just Warcraft, which has an estimated three million players in China, but Blizzard's other hits like multiplayer shooter Overwatch, card game Hearthstone, and sci-fi strategy title Starcraft.

Ugly dispute goes public

NetEase's president of global investment, Simon Zhu, said he had spent ""10,000 hours"" playing those games in a damning statement about the break-up.

""One day, when what has happened behind the scene could be told, developers and gamers will have a whole new level of understanding of how much damage a jerk can make,"" he wrote on LinkedIn.

NetEase rejected an offer earlier this month to extend the agreement by six months, describing the proposal as ""commercially illogical"" and accusing Blizzard of ""seeking a divorce but still remaining attached"".

Citing a person close to Blizzard, Reuters news agency reported that the dispute was down to NetEase wanting structural changes that would impact the US firm's control over its intellectual property.

NetEase insisted ""any usage and licensing of Blizzard's IP were done in accordance with contract terms and with Blizzard's consent and approval"" throughout the 14-year agreement.

The companies had previously renewed their initial 2008 deal in 2019.

Players invited to put characters on ice

Ahead of the deal ending on Monday, Blizzard took the unusual step of allowing their Chinese Warcraft players to download their characters and progress, which for some will span thousands upon thousands of hours.

Their data will be able to uploaded back into the game if Blizzard finds a new distribution partner in China, which remains one of the world's most lucrative markets despite restrictions imposed by the government.

NetEase's rise to becoming China's second-largest gaming company has been driven largely by its partnership with Blizzard, but its own titles now account for more than 60% of its revenue.

The country's industry leader is Tencent, which - as well as making its own games - owns US gaming giant Riot, the firm behind League Of Legends; and holds stakes in major Western developers like Fortnite maker Epic and Assassin's Creed creators Ubisoft.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123033226/http://news.sky.com/story/world-of-warcraft-among-top-games-going-offline-in-china-forcing-millions-of-players-to-say-goodbye-12791311
212;Latest Johnson scandal may not damage former PM - but what will the fallout be for Rishi Sunak?;Monday 23 January 2023 02:54, UK;['rob powell', '@robpowellnews'];['boris johnson'];['prime', 'given', 'mr', 'boris', 'minister', 'johnson', 'westminster', 'tax', 'fallout', 'sunak', 'latest', 'zahawi', 'damage', 'scandal', 'rishi'];"At the height of the partygate saga, a joke went round Westminster that every time the sense of crisis began to escalate, Boris Johnson would get on the phone to the Ukrainian President to arrange another trip to Kyiv.

Perhaps old habits die hard, as this weekend saw the classic Johnson double-header of a Sunday newspaper scandal combined with a dash to the war-torn country.

The optics of the former prime minister sitting next to a union flag at the president's table are likely to warm the cockles of his allies in Westminster though - some of whom have already been floating the idea that he could return before the next election.

But anyone searching for a reminder of the downsides of the Johnson era needn't look far.

The curious case of the £800,000 loan, the prime minister and the BBC chairman taps into all the trappings of a textbook Westminster controversy.

This may prove to be just a precursor to the Privileges Committee partygate investigation though - potentially the moment where many more gory details are churned up and laid out for all to see.

Combine all this with polling showing Mr Johnson is a good deal less popular across the country than he is with his loyalists in parliament, and a return to power anytime soon seems unlikely.

But how damaging are these stories to Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party more generally?

Answering this question is always difficult given the tendency of Westminster scandal to lower the public's opinion of all politicians, rather than those of one specific party.

Mr Sunak may also find himself protected from some of the splatter of the Johnson controversies given his role in bringing down his former cabinet colleague.

That said, having kept the Tory Chairman Nadhim Zahawi in government, revelations that he had to repay tax from the sale of shares by an offshore trust are unfortunate for Mr Sunak given his wife's previous non-dom status.

Rishi Sunak branded 'total liability' as he faces backlash from MPs

Setting this all in perspective though, it's unlikely to rival NHS pressure and cost of living as issues that will influence the next election and determine how rough a ride the prime minister has with his MPs in the months ahead.

With that in mind, the most problematic moment of the last week for Mr Sunak could turn out to be when he told an audience in Lancashire that they were ""not idiots"" and so understood why he couldn't cut tax straight away.

That may easily be viewed as a direct barb by the many backbenchers who do want the tax burden reduced immediately.

Most of them are still keeping their counsel, but as inflation eases and the election grows ever nearer, that will likely change.

Then it could be Mr Sunak scrambling for a trip to Kyiv.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123033226/http://news.sky.com/story/latest-johnson-scandal-may-not-damage-former-pm-but-what-will-the-fallout-be-for-rishi-sunak-12793232

The small city of around 61,000 people is eight miles east of downtown Los Angeles but could be a different country, with its Chinese supermarkets, dumpling restaurants and shop signs written in Chinese alongside English.

More than 65% of the people who live here are Asian American. It is, as one scholar described it, ""an ethnic enclave in the suburbs that thrives because it refuses to assimilate, instead unapologetically catering to its own immigrant community"".

Still, it is not immune to the most American of tragedies. But even as Monterey Park comes to terms with 10 people shot dead during a ballroom dance class, there is a quiet and peaceful resolve.

In front of a police cordon on the street where the massacre took place, a group of people kneel and pray, asking their God for strength.

Image: The Lunar New Year celebrations have been cancelled

Chinese New Year took place at the weekend and just hours before the shooting the street had been filled with thousands of people listening to live music or buying meat skewers from food stalls.

""It is so horrible, it's like this happening for many people on a Christmas Eve or something, it's just terrible,"" Robert Chao Romero, a professor of Asian American studies at UCLA, tells me.

On Sunday, families with children wearing traditional Chinese dresses came to Monterey Park from other parts of LA, expecting the second day of the Lunar New Year festival to be under way, but arrived to see stalls and signs being dismantled and police blockades.

When they learned the reason why, they were horrified.

One local woman came to lay flowers but dissolved into tears when she considered the contrast of what this weekend should have looked like for Monterey Park.

""It's extremely painful, it kills me that this is happening to these families. This is one of the most united, kind and friendly communities.

""I might not be celebrating but I wanted to be part of this to let the Asian community know that they are so special to me.""

An evening news conference brought the news that a 72-year-old suspect had been found dead inside a white van 30 miles away in the city of Torrance with self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

The immediate danger was over for Monterey Park, bringing relief to people who had been terrorised for hours, but gun violence is the never-ending scourge of life in America.

This is the deadliest mass shooting since 19 children and two teachers were killed in a primary school in Uvalde, Texas, last May but it is far from the only one.

Image: The gunman was found dead in this white van

Since the turn of the year there have been 33 mass shootings - defined by the Gun Violence Archive as when four or more people, not including the shooter, are injured or killed - in the US.

Police believe the gunman in Monterey Park used a semi-automatic rifle to murder and maim, perhaps obtained illegally.

California has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country but still it was not enough to deter a determined killer.

Another mass shooting has prompted another chorus of calls for tighter gun control, particularly over automatic and semi-automatic weapons, which are designed to kill.

Questions about the now Tory chairman's deal with tax authorities have continued, even after he released a statement to ""address some of the confusion about my finances"".

On Saturday he admitted he paid what HMRC said ""was due"" after it ""disagreed about the exact allocation"" of shares in the YouGov polling company he co-founded, an error he noted was ""careless"" not deliberate.

""This whole episode is deeply damaging to public trust, with a chancellor in charge of the nation's finances asking the public to pay their taxes while apparently having failed to do so himself.

""His position is clearly untenable. Every hour that Rishi Sunak refuses to sack him shows just how weak the prime minister is.""

James Cleverly insisted Mr Zahawi will survive in his post until at least Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.

Berlin has hesitated in signing off on supplying the German-made Leopards, but agreed on Friday to review its stocks.

Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki criticised Germany's reluctance, saying that if the country did not consent to transferring Leopard tanks to Ukraine, his country was prepared to build a ""smaller coalition"" of countries that would send theirs anyway.

Sending Ukraine tanks weakens UK forces

On Sunday, the speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament, State Duma chairman Vyacheslav Volodin, said: ""Supplies of offensive weapons to the Kyiv regime would lead to a global catastrophe.

""If Washington and NATO supply weapons that would be used for striking peaceful cities and making attempts to seize our territory as they threaten to do, it would trigger a retaliation with more powerful weapons.""

Germany is one of the main donors of weapons to Ukraine, and it ordered a review of its Leopard 2 stocks in preparation for a possible green light.

However, the government in Berlin has shown caution at each step of increasing its commitments to Ukraine.

French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, has said he does not rule out sending Leclerc battle tanks to Ukraine and had asked his defence minister to ""work on"" the idea.

UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said he would like ""nothing more"" than to see Ukrainians armed with the German-made tanks.

So far among the NATO allies, only the UK has agreed to send tanks to Ukraine, in the form of 14 British Army Challenger 2s.

There had been hopes that Germany would authorise the release of its battle tanks, which are potentially available in far greater numbers.

But at the conclusion of a pledging conference on Friday at the US airbase in Ramstein, Germany, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said: ""I don't have any announcements to make on M1s (US Abrams tanks), and you heard the German minister of defence say that they've not made a decision on Leopards.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123070301/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-germany-would-not-stand-in-the-way-if-poland-decides-to-send-tanks-to-fight-russia-12793321

Kayleigh Barton, who set up a fundraising page for her son's under-12s team - FC United of Wrexham - said she was in ""complete shock"".

Reynolds and fellow actor Rob McElhenney are owners of the city's National League side, which they took over in 2021.

In response to Ms Barton's appeal, Reynolds made a donation of £600 followed by another of £1,000.

Ms Barton said: ""I was nearly in tears. I know how much that money means to the club and the lads. Happy is an understatement.""

In her original plea, she said she wanted all the boys to be able to wear the same kit ""as they work so hard"".

GoFundMe confirmed the two donations were from the actor.

Nadhim Zahawi should resign from government after he defended his tax affairs in a TV interview despite evidence that what he was saying was ""not true"", a tax expert has claimed.

Dan Neidle, a lawyer and founder of Tax Policy Associates, has spent months investigating Mr Zahawi. In the interests of full disclosure, he told Sky News he personally supports the Labour Party, but advises politicians from across the spectrum and he ""always keep my tax analysis and legal work separate from my private political views"".

This weekend Mr Zahawi confirmed he paid a penalty to HMRC while he was chancellor over unpaid tax. But Mr Neidle said this raises questions over comments made by Mr Zahawi to Kay Burley last summer, while the then-chancellor was running to be leader of his party.

Mr Zahawi told Kay he was ""clearly being smeared"" over questions about his affairs - and that he did not ""benefit"" from an ""offshore trust"".



Speaking to Kay today, Mr Neidle said that a filing disclosure showed that Mr Zahawi ""received £99,000 from Balshore Investments"", a company based in Gibraltar.

Mr Neidle said: ""That's not my supposition or a guess - it's absolute fact.

""And yet he denied that to you.

""I said to his lawyers - why is he saying this to Kay Burley when the evidence says it's not true?

""And they wouldn't reply.""

He added: ""It could be there's an innocent explanation for this which makes perfect sense - I lack the imagination to see it.

""And if there isn't one, I think he should resign.""

Mr Neidle said that Mr Zahawi saying he was ""careless"" when settling with HMRC means that ""there was a penalty"" the ex-chancellor had to pay.

In summary on the story, Mr Neidle said: ""I think he would have received about £27m and not paid tax on it until eventually he was forced to because it was being reported. Didn't admit it, denied it, threatened to sue people and went to HMRC to quietly settle it.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123090513/https://news.sky.com/story/politics-latest-nadhim-zahawis-tax-affairs-probed-nhs-workers-strike-across-england-and-wales-12593360

Fuller, Smith & Turner (FS&T;) estimated it had lost £4m in sales due to the strike action since last autumn - denting its momentum despite the continued challenge from the cost of living crisis.

""Sales for the four-week Christmas and New Year period increased by 38% against a trading period last year that was impacted by Covid restrictions and work from home guidance"", the company said.

""Due to the impact of the train strikes, our sales compared to the same four weeks in 2019 have declined by 5%.

""Since the start of October, we estimate that industrial action has reduced our sales by some £4m and the consequent impact on profitability means that we now expect to report earnings below market expectations for the full year.""

The update from Fuller's chimes with separate evidence that train strikes have damaged high street sales for both retail and hospitality businesses.

Traffic numbers have consistently shown a slump in visits to town and city centre destinations on days when strikes have taken place.

Russia's appointment of General Valery Gerasimov as its new commander in Ukraine does not appear to be yielding entirely successful results, according to the latest update from the UK's ministry of defence.

It says General Gerasimov, who is also Chief of the General Staff, has sought to improve ""day-to-day discipline"" since being installed.

This has reportedly included a crackdown on non-regulation uniform, travel in civilian vehicles, the use of mobile phones, and non-standard haircuts - which in themselves would seem unlikely to attract an exclusively positive response from troops.

However, the MoD says the ""greatest derision has been reserved for attempts to improve the standard of troops' shaving"".

It says the move has been described by officials in the Donetsk People's Republic as a ""farce"" that would damage ""the process of destroying the enemy"".

The aforementioned and increasingly prominent Wagner mercenary group owner Yevgeny Prigozhin (see 7.06 post) is also among critics of the decision, reportedly saying ""war is the time of the active and courageous, and not of the clean-shaven"".

Nadhim Zahawi is ""absolutely not going to resign"", a source close to the party chairman has said.

It comes amid growing pressure on the former chancellor over his tax affairs.

Sky News was told last night that Mr Zahawi settled the matter with HMRC while he was chancellor last year.

The issue relates to the founding of polling company YouGov, and how he benefitted from the business.

On Saturday, Mr Zahawi admitted he paid what HMRC said ""was due"" after it ""disagreed about the exact allocation"" of shares in the YouGov polling company he co-founded, an error he noted was ""careless"" but not deliberate.

But he did not disclose the size of the settlement - reported to be an estimated £4.8m including a 30% penalty - or whether he paid a fine.

Chief executive of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) will use a speech on Monday afternoon to demand the chancellor reverses ""the UK's trajectory"" of falling investment through a series of actions, with a focus on green growth.

Tony Danker will argue that the country is lagging behind international rivals in the sphere - and that Jeremy Hunt's looming spring budget provides an opportunity for government to help business achieve it.

This could be done in areas including reform of the consent process for green infrastructure.

He is also seeking new regulation to stimulate domestic demand for green technologies.

Mr Danker was due too to complain about huge uncertainties for UK firms over the Retained EU Law Bill, which says that at the end of this year all retained EU law in the UK expires.

A permanent successor to the super deduction tax that ends in April is needed to prevent the UK from dropping from fifth to 30th place among the 38 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) advanced economies for capital investment, Mr Danker was also expected to say.

""The PM set out less than a year ago what is needed to transform our economy. The ideas are there. Let's stop second guessing ourselves and get on because there is money on the table to capture right now.""

Mr Danker's remarks chime with warnings that the UK economy, which could yet be in recession, may see a deeper downturn than initially expected.

It added that the following two years were also the subject of a downgrade due, partly, to less government support and higher taxes.

The predicted performance for 2023 was far worse than the 0.3% dip it had expected just three months ago.

The recession was not tipped to last longer than beyond the first half of this year.

Official figures are yet to show whether the UK fell into recession during the second half of 2022.

He added: ""The economy is still expected to return to growth during the second half of 2023 and has been spared any significant new external shocks in the last three months from energy prices, COVID-19 or geopolitics.

Analysis by Civitas of Office for National Statistics (ONS) data from 2020-21 showed a record 54.2% of people (36 million) now live in households which received more in benefits than they contributed in taxes.

This includes non-cash benefits such as NHS and education services.

The study also showed 83% of all income tax is paid by 40% of British adults.

Authors Tim Knox and Daniel Lilley say the ""net dependency ratio"" is the highest on record.

It fell from 52.5% to 47.5% in 2019-20, but grew during the pandemic due to increased government aid.

Civitas, a right-wing think tank, said the long-term trend is ""clearly"" on the up, comparing the 1977-2000 average of 41.2% with 2020-21's figure of 54.2%.

It also found around 27 million people receive an average of £23,000 per year in cash benefits and ""benefits in kind"" - goods and services provided to an employee for free or at reduced costs such as a company car or private health insurance.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said such benefits will rise by 10.1% from April in line with the rate of inflation at a cost of £11bn.

He also said he was concerned about a ""sharp increase in economically inactive working age adults"" since the start of the pandemic, and announced a review into the issues holding people back from work.

Sky News has learnt that Lithia Motors, which has a market capitalisation on the New York Stock Exchange of more than $6.5bn, is within weeks of finalising a deal to buy its UK-based peer.

One insider cautioned that a deal remained under discussion and could yet fall apart.

If successfully completed, it would see Jardine Motors being sold by Jardine Matheson Holdings, the historic Hong Kong-headquartered conglomerate.

Jardine Matheson owns assets including the Mandarin Oriental hotel chain and Hong Kong Land.

Sources said a takeover would give Lithia a substantial foothold in the UK, with access to luxury car brands including Ferrari and Maserati.

Lithia is committed to using the Jardine Motors business as a platform for growth, they added.

It would be the latest in a string of attempted deals in the sector, with Pendragon recently having ended talks about a takeover by its largest shareholder.

Lithia itself also tried to buy Pendragon last year.

Other big players in the sector include Lookers, while major online competitors such as Cazoo have suffered from the global sell-off in technology stocks.

Jardine Motors was acquired as a single East Anglia dealership by Jardine Matheson in the early 1990s.

It employs roughly 2,700 people at 50 sites across the UK, according to its website.

Responding to an enquiry from Sky News on Monday, a Lithia spokesman said: ""Lithia has a stated desire to expand into the UK market and has held discussions with Jardine Matheson with a view to investing in Jardine Motors Group UK.

""Jardine Motors Group UK is one of the UK's leading automotive retailers and Lithia firmly believes that a combination of the two businesses will help to deliver significant value for employees, partners and customers.

""Lithia views the potential acquisition of Jardine Motors as a platform for future growth in the UK and plans to invest in the business, working with Jardine Motors' market-leading management team to build on the strong momentum the Group has generated in recent years.

""Discussions around a potential transaction are ongoing and a further update will be issued in due course.""

Jardine Motors has yet to reveal financial results for 2022, but saw revenues rise 19% in 2021, with an operating profit of £28m.

A Jardine Motors spokesman declined to comment.

It was unclear whether its London-listed parent company would also issue a statement confirming the talks.

On the same story, Richard Sharp, the BBC chairman, has asked for a review into his appointment after claims he helped Boris Johnson secure a loan.

Mr Sharp said he wanted to ensure ""all the appropriate guidelines have been followed"" and so he had asked the nominations committee of the BBC board to review any potential conflicts of interest.

In a letter to BBC staff, read out on the BBC News channel, Mr Sharp said: ""Prior to my appointment, I introduced an old friend of mine – and distant cousin of the then prime minister – Sam Blythe, to the cabinet secretary [Simon Case], as Sam wanted to support Boris Johnson.

""I was not involved in making a loan, or arranging a guarantee, and I did not arrange any financing. What I did do was to seek an introduction of Sam Blythe to the relevant official in government.

""Sam Blythe, who I have known for more than forty years, lives in London and having become aware of the financial pressures on the then prime minister, and being a successful entrepreneur, he told me he wanted to explore whether he could assist.""

As we reported in our previous post, Boris Johnson says Mr Sharp ""knows absolutely nothing about my personal finances - I can tell you that for 100% ding dang sure"".

Mr Sharp's letter said he told Mr Blythe ""that this was a sensitive area in any event, particularly so as Sam is a Canadian, and that he should seek to have the Cabinet Office involved and have the cabinet secretary advise on appropriateness and indeed whether any financial support Sam might wish to provide was possible"".

He added: ""I went to see the cabinet secretary and explained who Sam was, and that as a cousin of the then prime minister he wanted to help him if possible. I also reminded the cabinet secretary that I had submitted my application for the position of BBC chairman.""

Mr Sharp said that afterwards he had no more involvement with the process to ""avoid any conflict of interest"" - as agreed with Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.

""At that point there was no detail on the proposed arrangements and I had no knowledge of whether any assistance was possible, or could be agreed,"" Mr Sharp said.

In some good news, the average personal debt level across the UK has decreased by 22% since 2020, according to Creditfix.

Data pulled from the personal insolvency provider's Personal Debt Index showed the average total of unsecured debt per adult stands at £14,400.46.

This is down from £18,479.74 in 2020.

But the bad news is, the number of people struggling to pay back debts under £2,000 has soared by a huge 408%.

According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, UK households will spend £83billion in servicing debts (mortgages, credit cards and personal loans) in 2023-24 – an increase of 52% from 2022.

""The cost of living crisis has wreaked havoc on the economy with the UK currently experiencing the highest inflation rate in over 40 years and the biggest drop in living standards in over 60 years,"" said Creditfix regional manager Layla Johnson.

235;Investigation launched into appointment process of BBC chairman after Boris Johnson loan claim;Monday 23 January 2023 16:17, UK;['faye brown', '@fayebrownsky'];['bbc', 'boris johnson'];['sharp', 'mr', 'boris', 'cookies', 'richard', 'johnson', 'blyth', 'investigation', 'claim', 'chairman', 'appointment', 'bbc', 'public', 'sam', 'process', 'loan', 'launched'];"An investigation will be launched into the appointment of the BBC chairman following reports he helped Boris Johnson secure a loan.

William Shawcross, the Commissioner for Public Appointments, said he would review the competition which led to Richard Sharp's appointment while Mr Johnson was prime minister.

He made the announcement in response to a request from shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell.

He said: ""The role of the commissioner is to oversee the public appointments process and ensure appointments are made fairly, openly and on merit.

""I intend to review this competition to assure myself and the public that the process was run in compliance with the government's governance code for public appointments.""

The Sunday Times reported Mr Sharp was involved in arranging a guarantor on a loan of up to £800,000 for Mr Johnson in late 2020, and that the then-prime minister went on to recommend him for the top job at the BBC.

The government's paymaster general, Jeremy Quin, told the Commons on Monday Mr Sharp went through an ""incredibly robust process"" by an independent panel ahead of his appointment and is ""absolutely confident"" the ""usual process"" will have been followed.

But the SNP's John Nicholson, who was on the Culture Select Committee Mr Sharp appeared in front of, said it was ""all a bit banana republic"" after he said they ""grilled him about his £400,000 gift to the Conservative Party"".

""However, he did not disclose his role in getting the man appointing him a huge loan,"" Mr Nicholson told the Commons.

Earlier on Monday, the chairman asked for the BBC to review any potential conflicts of interest he may currently have to ensure that ""all appropriate guidelines have been followed"" since he joined the broadcaster.

""We have many challenges at the BBC and I know that distractions such as this are not welcome,"" he said in a statement read out on BBC News.

The review will not look at his links to Mr Johnson's loan, but in a letter to BBC staff, Mr Sharp clarified some of the details surrounding the Sunday Times report.

He confirmed he introduced multimillionaire Canadian businessman Sam Blyth to cabinet secretary Simon Case ""as Sam wanted to support Boris Johnson"".

""I was not involved in making a loan, or arranging a guarantee, and I did not arrange any financing. What I did do was to seek an introduction of Sam Blyth to the relevant official in government,"" he said.

""Sam Blyth, who I have known for more than forty years, lives in London and having become aware of the financial pressures on the then-prime minister, and being a successful entrepreneur, he told me he wanted to explore whether he could assist.""

Mr Blyth is a distant cousin of Mr Johnson's.

Timeline November 2020:

According to the Sunday Times the loan guarantee was first suggested by Canadian millionaire Sam Blyth during a dinner with Richard Sharp. Early December 2020:

In early December, Richard Sharp put Sam Blyth in contact with the Cabinet Secretary, Simon Case. Late 2020:

Before the end of the year, Richard Sharp and Sam Blyth met with Boris Johnson for dinner at his country residence, Chequers. They insist the prime minister's finances were not discussed. January 2021:

At the start of January, the government announced Richard Sharp as the preferred candidate to be BBC chairman.

The statement was released moments after Mr Johnson said that Mr Sharp ""knows absolutely nothing about my personal finances"".

Speaking to Sky News he said: ""This is a load of complete nonsense - absolute nonsense.

""Let me just tell you, Richard Sharp is a great and wise man but he knows absolutely nothing about my personal finances - I can tell you that for 100% ding-dang sure.

""This is just another example of the BBC disappearing up its own fundament.""

The BBC reported that Mr Sharp ""has agreed with the board's senior independent director"" that the nominations committee will look at conflicts of interest when it next meets and, ""in the interests of transparency, publish the conclusions"".

Ms Powell said there also needed to be an independent investigation into the hiring process ""to satisfy the public and parliament of its integrity"".

On the commissioner opening an investigation, Labour's shadow culture secretary said: ""The BBC Chair, Number 10 and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport clearly have questions to answer.

""This probe is welcome news and should shine a light on this appointments process and provide reassurance to the public.""

The party has also reported Mr Johnson to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, saying the former prime minister's financial affairs are ""dragging the Conservative Party deeper into yet another quagmire of sleaze"".

The Cabinet Office has insisted Mr Sharp was appointed ""following a rigorous appointments process"".

This included assessment by a panel of experts and ""additional pre-appointment scrutiny by a House of Commons Select Committee"", according to a statement released yesterday.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123114635/https://news.sky.com/story/bbc-chairman-asks-for-review-into-any-conflict-of-interest-over-boris-johnson-loan-role-12793498

Essex Police say the motorist was initially spotted driving at ""excess speed"" on the M25 on Sunday night.

The vehicle was later stopped in the Essex town of Billericay.

Essex Roads Policing posted about the incident on Twitter, sharing an image of the windscreen.

The force wrote: ""This car flew past our very large marked car at excess speed on the M25 last night, stopped and reported.

""Other officers then stopped this driver in Billericay with a side driver's window just as bad.

Officers did not say in the post if the woman faced a penalty in relation to the windscreen.

Under the Highway Code, drivers ""must be able to see, so clear all snow and ice from all your windows"", according to the RAC.

Drivers judged to be ""using a vehicle in a dangerous condition"" can be fined up to £2,500 and given three penalty points on their licence.

There had been suggestions that events on the three-day weekend in May should be scaled back to acknowledge the current economic difficulties many are facing.

But Alastair Bruce, a former officer of arms of the Royal Household, told Sky News that ""the big help out"", planned for Monday 8 May, is central to what ""the King wants to emphasise"" in his reign as the cost of living crisis continues.

""The nation has a tradition of recognising that no matter what may come, good or bad, we have a story that is part of our nation that continues,"" he said.

""[The coronation] can be used to act as a cohesive opportunity to galvanise people to support those who are having a tough time.

""The great help out is there in order to encourage people who have celebrated over the previous two days to come out and do something for their community, to engage with the action.

""I think in doing that, more people will become aware of the incredible amount of effort that is being made on behalf of those who really need it.

""One of the great strengths of any nation is that it has a community and people who engage and support whatever the challenges are.

""During the Second World War, everyone came to play their part during the difficulties of the Blitz and everything else but we're in a sort of economic war at the moment and I think that the King is very aware of that.

""It would be a wonderful legacy if people continue in that work after the big help out.""

Buckingham Palace has announced details of the planned events, which will feature the coronation ceremony, grand procession and Charles's first balcony appearance as King on Saturday 6 May, a concert featuring global stars on Sunday 7 May and the day of volunteering on Monday 8 May.

Mr Bruce said that while the ceremony ""will have its reflections"" in the 1953 coronation, he expects the celebrations to be modernised.

Celebrating the worst of cinematic under-achievements, the annual Golden Raspberry Awards calls itself the ""ugly cousin"" of the Oscars and reveals its winners the night before the biggest awards in entertainment.

Netflix movie Blonde, starring Ana de Armas, received eight nominations including worst picture, worst supporting actors and worst director. Summing up the film, the parody awards show, said ""movie-goers liked even less than critics did"".

They go on: ""Called a 'biopic that's not a biopic,' by its makers, it 'explores' the exploitation of Marilyn Monroe…by continuing to exploit her posthumously"".

Good Mourning received seven nods, including worst actor, worst screen couple and worst screenplay, with Razzies calling it: ""A laugh-free stoner comedy achieving the rare feat of scoring a perfect ZERO on Rotten Tomatoes"".

Starring Machine Gun Kelly, whose real name is Colson Baker, alongside his real-life fiancé Megan Fox, the movie also has a cameo from comedian Pete Davidson.

Davidson's performance in the film has seen him nominated in the worst supporting actor category. He also got a worst actor nod - albeit only for his voice - for his role in kids animated film Marmaduke.

Two-time Oscar winning actor Tom Hanks has the dubious honour of multiple nominations. He got a worst actor nod for his portrayal of toymaker Geppetto in Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio.

Pinocchio got six nods overall, with Razzies calling it: ""Disney's wholly unnecessary (and oddly creepy) live action/CGI remake"".

Hanks also received a worst supporting actor nod for his part of talent manager Colonel Parker in Baz Luhrmann's Elvis.

Calling his performance ""widely derided"", they said pole position in the supporting actor category was currently held by: ""Tom Hanks' latex-laden, ludicrously accented portrayal of Col Tom Parker in the otherwise critically acclaimed Elvis"".

In the worst couple category, Hanks, ""his Latex-laden face"" and ""ludicrous accent"" are also listed as one of the nominations.

Accidental vampire movie Morbius - which Razzies called ""the year's most ridiculed movie"" - collected five nods, including worst actor for its star, Jared Leto, and supporting actress Adria Arjona.

And, in what Razzies called a ""buy one, get one free"", both 365 Days sequels - 365 Days: This Day and The Next 365 Days got nominated for worst remake / rip-off / sequel.

The Netflix erotic thriller is based on books by Polish author Blanka Lipinska, with the movies previously accused of ""glamourising rape"".

243;The Last Of Us: The science behind the real 'zombie' fungus - and is it an actual threat?;Monday 23 January 2023 12:47, UK;[];[];['real', 'actual', 'human', 'science', 'cordyceps', 'pic', 'threat', 'fungi', 'world', 'fungus', 'zombie', 'youre', 'able', 'species', 'humans'];"Could the next public health crisis be caused by a fungus?

The threat of such an emergency is posed at the outset of the hit TV series, The Last Of Us, which begins in the 1960s with a bleak speech by an epidemiologist on the danger of fungi.

""If the world were to get slightly warmer, then there is reason to evolve,"" warns a prescient John Hannah, referencing their potential to infect and overpower a person's mind.

""Candida, ergot, cordyceps, aspergillus: any one of them could be capable of burrowing into our brains and taking control of not millions of us, but billions.""

The show takes this idea and runs with it, jumping forward 40 years to when a mass cordyceps outbreak leads to a devastating pandemic which transforms people into blood-thirsty abominations.

An extreme outcome with plenty of artistic licence taken - but is it entirely without scientific basis?

Image: A mass cordyceps outbreak leads transforms people into blood-thirsty abominations in the show. Pic: HBO/Warner Media/Liane Hentscher

Do fungi really threaten humans?

""There are already fungi inhabiting the brains of human beings all over the planet,"" says Professor Elaine Bignell, a world leader in the field of human fungal pathogen research.

""A number of fungi species are quite prominent pathogens and kill hundreds of thousands of people every year - it's just that the public is not aware.""

Advertisement

The Last Of Us viewers may have noted that a few of the dangers identified by its fictional epidemiologist featured last year on a list of health-threatening fungi by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Among the ones deemed most high-risk was Aspergillus fumigatus, a common mould that is widespread in the environment in homes and outdoors, which can cause ""chronic and acute lung disease"" and can be deadly.

Image: Aspergillus is a type of mould, common in homes

Candida species, which causes common infections such as thrush and ringworm, is also a leading cause of bloodstream infection in intensive care patients.

Cryptococcosis neoformans - which infects the lungs and brain, causing pneumonia and meningitis in immunosuppressed patients - also made the list. It kills more than 100,000 people a year in sub-Saharan Africa.

""One thing that killer fungi do have in common is that they are able to grow at human body temperature, and that's unusual for a fungus,"" Prof Bignell tells Sky News.

""Most fungi in the environment are used to growing in more temperate conditions, and it places quite a strain on any microorganism to counteract an immune response in a human body and cope with the high temperature.""

Image: The main symptom of ringworm is a rash, which can spread. Pic: NHS

What about cordyceps?

Cordyceps was not on the threat list - but it is absolutely real.

The parasitic fungus infects and takes over the mind of insects, as it does to humans in The Last Of Us.

""There are about 600 species,"" says Dr Mark Ramsdale, a professor in molecular microbiology at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology.

""They are predominantly insect pathogens. It's their insect host that they manipulate and change their behaviour. And so from that perspective, there is some basis there.""

Image: A fly infected by a cordyceps fungus. Pic: Alejandro Santillana/University of Texas

Found in tropical forests, the fungus penetrates an insect's body via spores, which are released to allow a fungus to reproduce and defend itself.

The fungus then guides its host into more humid locations to help it grow, before feeding on the remains and launching new spores from its corpse.

When it comes to humans, cordyceps is used in treatments and therapeutics - notably Chinese herbal medicines.

""There's a long history of relationships between humans and this particular group,"" Dr Ramsdale tells Sky News.

""There's no evidence they're causing disease in humans. However, in terms of their insect relationships, they do manipulate their hosts - and several fungi have evolved this capacity over time.""

Could climate change the picture?

Another facet of The Last Of Us's foreboding speech shared by the WHO's landmark report was the influence of climate change on the nature of fungi and our relationship with it.

Prof Bignell says the impact of global heating will be ""profound"" for all microbes on our planet.

There are some 150,000 identified species of fungi in the world, well short of the millions estimated to exist, and few have what it takes to cope with the 37C temperature and other stresses imposed by the human body.

But some do, and more could - either those yet to be discovered or which adapt to survive on a warming planet.

Fungus unknown to science discovered in Scotland

""It changes the selection pressures that are put on those huge, diverse life forms,"" says Dr Ramsdale.

""Perhaps some could potentially make that transition from one lifestyle to another and become pathogenic in a context that we haven't thought of before.""

So the show's pandemic may be far from factual, but it's not completely without merit.

""What really is the most removed from the current status quo is the scale and the rate of the infections occurring in The Last Of Us,"" says Prof Bignell.

""Some fungi can get passed from one person to the next - and in the environment we are exposed to them all the time - but it would take a very significant variant to be able to cause the sorts of species extinction event that they're dramatising.""

So … no reason for alarm?

You can sleep easy knowing there won't be a fungus that turns you into a zombie in your cereal tomorrow morning.

But COVID, researchers say, is proof that we can't rest on our laurels when it comes to public health threats and the potentially sudden nature of their arrival.

And based on the response to the opening episode of The Last Of Us, people were quick to see the parallels.

With fungal infection in humans being a relatively modern phenomenon, with few examples until the 1980s, and the absence of any antifungal vaccine research programmes, there's certainly work to do.

""We have to be in a state of preparedness,"" says Prof Bignell.

""We have to have a very good understanding of how different fungi can cause human diseases, how our immune systems cope with those microbes, and a good medicine cabinet with antifungal agents we know are effective.""

In the meantime, if you do happen to see anyone that looks like they're covered in mushrooms and feasting on a member of their family - best steer clear.

Ukraine faces a ""logistical and training burden"" as it receives tanks from donor nations, according to a former senior intelligence and security officer.

Philip Ingram told Sky News that training took around 20 weeks for the average tank crew member, but Ukrainian soldiers will be forced to learn much quicker.

""Training takes a long time,"" said Mr Ingram.

""These have crews of four, the Ukrainians are used to operating tanks for crews of three. They've got a whole new system to learn

""The more different variants you've got, the bigger the logistic tail, the bigger the training burden, the harder it is to integrate them all together.""

His comments come as pressure builds on Germany to send Leopard 2s to Ukraine and to authorise the re-export of its tanks in other European nations.

245;Politics news - latest: Zahawi clings to job as Sunak orders tax investigation - amid 'evidence' TV interview defence was 'not true';;[];['live'];['mr', 'orders', 'investigation', 'tax', 'situation', 'sunak', 'true', 'tv', 'politics', 'latest', 'job', 'surrounding', 'statement', 'zahawi', 'payment', 'know', 'balshore'];"This is getting awkward for Sunak

The calls for his resignation grow ever louder – but so far, Nadhim Zahawi is standing firm. A source close to the Conservative Party chairman tells Sky News he is ""absolutely not going to resign"" despite growing pressure over his tax affairs.

He may not be willing to jump – but could he be pushed? Labour has been arguing that every passing hour without sacking him highlights the prime minister's weakness. This morning Rishi Sunak announced he's asked his independent ethics advisor, Sir Laurie Magnus, to carry out an investigation into the matter.

It doesn't exactly sound like full-throated support, but certainly the PM – and Mr Zahawi – will be hoping this intervention will cool the situation down.

But it's clear the many unanswered questions surrounding events will only keep fanning the flames of this story. We know Mr Zahawi paid out a settlement and a penalty over unpaid tax last summer– but don't know how much (reports suggest the bill was around £4.8m). The payment was negotiated and agreed during his short spell as chancellor of the Exchequer – and thus the man in charge of HMRC. Why was there not more transparency over the payment at the time? What exactly did the PM know when he appointed him chair of the party?

And what of the claims made by Dan Neidle (the tax expert who uncovered so much of the situation) that he and others were threatened by Mr Zahawi's lawyers for reporting on the tax bill at a time when the payment had already been made? Does Mr Zahawi still stand by his statement in an interview with Kay Burley in July that he had not benefitted from the Balshore Investments? Mr Neidle claims he has seen evidence Mr Zahawi received a £99,000 payment from the trust, and believes it's fair to infer that there were others too.

Now Mr Zahawi himself argues failure to pay was a ""careless and not deliberate error"" around the allocation of founder shares to his father in return for his help setting up YouGov, the massively successful market research and polling company he started in 2000.

In his statement yesterday Mr Zahawi goes on to argue that ""HMRC agreed with my accountants that I have never set up an offshore structure, including Balshore Investments, and that I am not the beneficiary of Balshore Investments"".

Mr Zahawi has been a popular figure in the Conservative Party with his inspirational rags-to-riches backstory after arriving in the UK as a child refugee from Iraq, and his leadership of the vaccine rollout programme during COVID. But is he proving to be more of a political liability now?

For Mr Sunak – a man who came to power promising to clear up politics, promising professionalism, integrity accountability – the optics of this situation are incredibly awkward.

And of course, it's not the only scandal the government is mired in this morning – following allegations that Tory donor Richard Sharp helped Boris Johnson secure a loan guarantee of up to £800,000 loan to help fund his living costs during his time as prime minister– weeks before being recommended by Mr Johnson for the £160,000 a year job as chair of the BBC.

Mr Sharp denies a conflict of interest, and says his only involvement was to ""connect people"" - although he too is now calling for a review into the process surrounding his appointment. Mr Johnson's spokesperson says the story is ""absolute nonsense"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123124715/http://news.sky.com/story/politics-news-latest-zahawi-clings-to-job-as-sunak-orders-tax-investigation-amid-evidence-tv-interview-defence-was-not-true-12593360

But questions about his financial affairs are now front and centre, having first gained prominence during the Stratford-on-Avon MP's short-lived campaign to become prime minister last summer.

The allegations centre on his links to a Gibraltar-based trust 'Balshore Investments Limited', of which his father Hareth Zahawi is a director.

When Nadhim Zahawi co-founded the polling firm YouGov in May 2000, the trust was allocated shares in the company equalling the number given to the other co-founder Stephan Shakespeare.

Asked about this by Kay Burley last year, the then chancellor said neither he nor his wife benefit from the Gibraltar trust and denied it was used to avoid tax, saying it was simply because his father ""lived abroad"".

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:24 Speaking in July 2022, the then Tory leadership contender Nadhim Zahawi told Kay Burley he was 'clearly being smeared' over tax claims.

The cabinet minister has also suggested the trust held the shares because his father was involved in setting up the company, had put money into it and had provided guidance.

Those working at YouGov at the time said Hareth Zahawi was helpful, albeit in an informal way, while others at the firm said he was not involved beyond being a shareholder.

Evidence from 2005 also appears to show - at that point, before he became an MP - Nadhim Zahawi was benefitting from this offshore trust.

A financial document published by YouGov sets out that a dividend payment that was due to go to Balshore instead was used to pay off loans owed by Mr Zahawi.

Potential tax saving uncovered

Much of this detail was first uncovered by Dan Neidle - a lawyer who used to work for a top corporate and now runs a not-for-profit focussed on tax policy.

Tory sources have briefed that Mr Neidle - who is a Labour member - is a ""Labour activist"" and the allegations are merely taken from his ""blog"".

This comes after lawyers acting for Mr Zahawi sent Mr Neidle a series of letters last year threatening legal action if he continued to publish analysis of the Tory MP's financial affairs.

After digging through pages of documents, Mr Neidle had suggested there would have been a potential tax saving of several million pounds when Balshore sold its YouGov shares.

That's because they were held in an offshore trust rather than by Mr Zahawi directly, and hence not eligible for capital gains tax.

It's this figure that is at the centre of the repayment to HMRC.

On Friday, the Guardian newspaper suggested Mr Zahawi reached a settlement with the exchequer that reflected the fact he should have paid tax on the sale of these shares at the time.

Nadhim Zahawi's statement in full ""As a senior politician I know that scrutiny and propriety are important parts of public life. Twenty-two years ago I co-founded a company called YouGov. I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved. It is an amazing business that has employed thousands of people and provides a world-beating service. ""When we set it up, I didn't have the money or the expertise to go it alone. So I asked my father to help. In the process, he took founder shares in the business in exchange for some capital and his invaluable guidance. Twenty-one years later, when I was being appointed chancellor of the exchequer, questions were being raised about my tax affairs. I discussed this with the Cabinet Office at the time. ""Following discussions with HMRC, they agreed that my father was entitled to founder shares in YouGov, though they disagreed about the exact allocation. They concluded that this was a 'careless and not deliberate' error. ""So that I could focus on my life as a public servant, I chose to settle the matter and pay what they said was due, which was the right thing to do. ""Additionally, HMRC agreed with my accountants that I have never set up an offshore structure, including Balshore Investments, and that I am not the beneficiary of Balshore Investments. This matter was resolved prior to my appointments as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and subsequently chairman of the party I love so much. When I was appointed by the prime minister, all my tax affairs were up to date.""

Tax affairs up to date

Mr Zahawi has now confirmed that tax was repaid saying that HMRC had concluded his father was not entitled to the share allocation handed to him when YouGov was created.

The Tory chairman said this was a ""careless and not a deliberate error"" and didn't confirm if any penalty was also levied.

He also re-stated that he was not a beneficiary of Balshore Investments and had never set up an offshore structure.

However, this intervention clashes somewhat with previous assertions that his tax affairs ""were and are fully up to date"".

Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) has already been visible through binoculars and telescopes this month, but could become visible with the naked eye as it gets ever nearer to our planet.

Experts say those without equipment should try to catch it on 1 and 2 February, when the green comet will look its brightest against the night sky.

At its closest point (a mere 28 million miles away), it will be visible from the northern and southern hemisphere.

NASA described the comet's rare fly-by as an ""awesome opportunity to make a personal connection with an icy visitor from the distant outer solar system"".

When is the best time to see it?

Until now, the visibility has been at its best before dawn.

But as January winds down and February begins, the comet will be visible from the evening onwards.

The comet will be at its nearest and brightest between next Wednesday and Thursday.

However, the Royal Observatory at Greenwich suggests you check what time the moon will rise where you live, so to avoid its bright light drowning out the comet's shine.

And while C/2022 E3 (ZTF) has been tipped to be one of the very best comet sightings of 2023, it won't be quite as stunning as the Neowise comet from three years ago.

That one left a picturesque streak behind it as it flew by Earth.

Is there anything I can use to help me spot it?

Binoculars and telescopes have made the comet easy to spot since 12 January.

But even without such equipment, there are ways you can give yourself a better chance of seeing it as it gets closer.

Stargazing apps like Night Sky, SkyView and Sky Guide can be a great utility, as they can help you find the precise location of comets by helping you map constellations of stars.

By pointing your smartphone's camera up at the night sky, such apps will use augmented reality to tell you which constellations you're looking at and offer tips on how to spot comets.

When the green comet gets closest to Earth, it will be in the Camelopardalis constellation.

If you want to try and see it before then, it's travelling through Corona Borealis, Bootes, Draco, and Ursa Minor.

What else do we know about C/2022 E3 (ZTF)?

The icy green comet was only discovered on 2 March 2022, spotted from the Zwicky Transient Facility in California.

Astronomers calculated that it had an orbital period - the time it takes to travel round the sun - of 50,000 years.

That would put its last journey this close to Earth as back in the Stone Age.

The comet is thought to have originated in the outskirts of the solar system in the Oort Cloud.

NASA describes the cloud as a ""collection of icy objects farther away than everything else in the solar system"".

It's so far away that no spacecraft have yet been sent to explore it, though there are some en route.

Rishi Sunak launched an investigation into Nadhim Zahawi after ""additional facts"" became known over the weekend.

This calls into question what Mr Sunak knew - and what Mr Zahawi had told him - before the PM defended his colleague at Prime Minister's Questions last week.

Speaking to journalists at this morning's briefing, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""Over the weekend additional facts have been placed in the public domain by the chairman.

""As you heard from the prime minister this morning, he thinks it's right because of this to ask his independent adviser to establish the facts.""

Asked last Wednesday in the House of Commons about Mr Zahawi's tax affairs, Mr Sunak said: ""My right honourable friend has already addressed the matter in full and there is nothing more that I can add.""

Mr Sunak's spokesman was asked if the PM knew Mr Zahawi had paid a penalty to HMRC.

""That's not my understanding,"" the spokesman said.

Asked about the nature of the probe being carried out by the government's ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, the Downing Street spokesman, said ""potential breaches of the ministerial code relating to ministerial declarations"" would be the main subject.

But asked if Sir Laurie would look into whether Mr Zahawi lied to the media, they said: ""The adviser is able to look more widely if they see fit.""

And asked whether Sir Laurie could look at whether Mr Zahawi's tax arrangement was a suitable one for a minister, the spokesman said: ""His role is to establish potential breaches of the ministerial code, so that potentially could fall within that remit, but I wouldn't seek to be too prescriptive.""

252;What is the Demand Flexibility Service and how can I save £100 off my energy bill if I sign up?;Monday 23 January 2023 12:56, UK;[];['cost of living'];['service', 'sign', 'energy', 'bill', 'demand', 'grid', 'smart', 'suppliers', 'save', 'usage', 'flexibility', 'supplier', 'taking', 'reduce', 'times', '100'];"People are being asked to cut down on their energy usage in exchange for money off their bills for the first time.

So far 26 energy suppliers are offering customers with smart meters the chance to save money in return for reduced usage at certain times.

The National Grid's 'Demand Flexibility Service' will help avoid the need for emergency generators to be used or blackouts to be enforced when the grid comes under pressure during peak times this winter.

It was first trialled by Octopus Energy on 1 November, with other firms following suit, but the scheme is now officially under way after successful tests last year.

What is it and why is it happening?

The National Grid's Electricity System Operator (ESO) announced the Demand Flexibility Service in 2022 following a successful pilot with 100,000 Octopus customers.

With global energy shortages due to spiralling prices and reduced supply from Vladimir Putin's Russia, the grid could be unable to cope with the increased demand of people trying to keep their homes warm this winter.

At peak times during the colder weather, there could be so much demand that emergency generators have to be used - which are both expensive and bad for the environment.

The grid has also warned three-hour strategic blackouts could be scheduled to help manage supply, but these haven't been needed yet.

The DFS hopes to take pressure off the grid by reducing energy consumption before that happens.

How does it work?

You can only take part in the scheme if you have a smart meter and your energy supplier is signed up.

This is because the grid needs to monitor your energy every 30 minutes, which is only possible with a smart meter.

On 12 days between 1 November 2022 and 31 March 2023 your energy company will ask you to reduce your energy usage - four times in the first month - and twice in each subsequent month.

This will usually be between 4pm and 7pm.

Customers are notified the day before so they can opt in or out depending on whether it suits their schedule.

The 'energy saving sessions' will only last for around an hour and will require you to reduce your normal energy consumption by around 30%.

The easiest way to do this is by not using energy-intensive appliances such as cookers, washing machines and dishwashers.

Light bulbs and TVs use very little energy - so there's no need to turn the lights off or abstain from watching your programme during that time.

The grid then compares your energy usage in 30-minute increments with your normal levels - and your supplier will give you around £3 for every unit (kilowatt-hour) you save.

This could total up to £100 over the five-month period which will be automatically deducted from your bill.

The grid has said that longer saving sessions of between three and four hours, which they refer to as 'live events', could be introduced on top if needed.

What if I don't reduce my energy enough?

If you sign up and either can't take part or don't reduce your usage enough during the session, you will just get less money off your bill.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:58 How would planned blackouts work?

Which suppliers are taking part - and will it be rolled out wider in the future?

Octopus launched its pilot scheme on 1 November with 400,000 people taking part.

British Gas began its DFS on 1 December with around 100,000 customers.

Eon, OVO energy, Shell and Engie are among the 26 suppliers now signed up.

If you haven't already been contacted by your supplier, you can get in touch with them to show an interest if you're eligible.

The ESO says similar schemes are ""likely to become a major feature of the market in years to come"".

Chief executive Chris O'Shea said: ""The electricity grid is facing increased pressure and smart technology plays a key role in managing peak demand - reducing consumption has the added benefit of helping consumers save on their energy bills.

Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: ""From partygate to seatbelt gate, these Conservative politicians are just taking the British people for fools.""

Mr Sunak's premiership has been hit with a series of controversies since he entered Number 10 in October.

He is facing calls to sack Nadhim Zahawi as Tory party chairman after details of a multi-million pound tax dispute emerged.

Mr Zahawi settled his tax issue with HMRC while he was serving as chancellor, a government source has told Sky News.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123140243/http://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-says-he-deeply-regrets-failing-to-wear-seatbelt-i-made-a-mistake-12793539
255;Nadhim Zahawi: Rishi Sunak orders investigation into Tory party chairman amid calls to sack him over tax row;Monday 23 January 2023 13:26, UK;['faye brown', '@fayebrownsky'];['nadhim zahawi'];['mr', 'row', 'questions', 'minister', 'nadhim', 'orders', 'tax', 'sunak', 'tory', 'party', 'zahawi', 'zahawis', 'neidle', 'sack', 'settlement', 'rishi'];"Rishi Sunak has ordered an investigation into Nadhim Zahawi as he resisted calls to sack the Tory party chairman over his tax dispute.

The prime minister asked new ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus on Monday to assess whether the cabinet minister breached the ministerial code with the HMRC settlement he made while he was chancellor.

Mr Sunak said he was launching an investigation because ""clearly in this case there are questions that need answering"".

But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""He promised us, his first words, integrity and accountability.

""Well, if those words mean anything, the prime minister should sack him and sack him today and show some leadership.""

Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has also said Mr Zahawi's position is ""untenable"".

Earlier, a source close to the embattled Tory MP said he is ""absolutely not going to resign"" in the face of growing pressure over his settlement, estimated to be around £5m.

His defiance comes after the tax expert who investigated Mr Zahawi joined calls for him to go, telling Sky News there is ""clear evidence"" he has not been truthful about his affairs.

Dan Neidle, the Founder of Tax Policy Associates and a Labour member, pointed to comments made by Mr Zahawi to Kay Burley last summer, while the then-chancellor was running to be leader of his party.

Mr Zahawi said he was ""clearly being smeared"" over questions about his affairs - and that he did not ""benefit"" from an ""offshore trust"".

Speaking to Kay Burley on Monday, Mr Neidle said that a filing disclosure from YouGov - the polling company Mr Zahawi co-founded - showed he ""received £99,000 from Balshore Investments"", a company based in Gibraltar.

Mr Neidle said: ""That's not my supposition or a guess - it's absolute fact.

""And yet he denied that to you.""

Mr Neidle said there could be ""an innocent explanation"" for Mr Zahawi's tax error, which the Tory MP called ""careless not deliberate"".

But he added: ""I lack the imagination to see it and if there isn't one, I think he should resign.""

What we still don't know about Zahawi's tax dispute

Image: Nadhim Zahawi did not answer questions when he arrived at Conservative Party headquarters on Monday

Questions about Mr Zahawi's tax affairs have continued, even after he released a statement to ""address some of the confusion about my finances"".

On Saturday he admitted he paid what HMRC said ""was due"" after it ""disagreed about the exact allocation"" of shares in YouGov.

But he did not disclose the size of the settlement - reported to be an estimated £4.8m including a 30% penalty - or whether he paid a fine.

Sky News understands he did pay a fine, and Mr Neidle said the use of the word ""careless"" confirms this.

He said ""careless means something specific"" in tax terms - ""that you didn't behave in a reasonable way"".

""A reasonable way is you instruct decent tax advisers. You tell them the truth, you follow their advice, you check your final tax returns as best you can.""

It is also not clear how much money Mr Zahawi made before settling the dispute.

Mr Neidle said: ""I think he would have received about £27m and not paid tax on it until eventually he was forced to because it was being reported. He didn't admit it, denied it, threatened to sue people and went to HMRC to quietly settle it.""

Mr Zahawi did not answer questions from reporters as he headed into the Conservative Party headquarters in Westminster earlier on Monday.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123140243/http://news.sky.com/story/nadhim-zahawi-rishi-sunak-orders-investigation-into-tory-party-chairman-amid-calls-to-sack-him-over-tax-row-12793476

257;How do prepayment meters work and why is there a crackdown on them?;Monday 23 January 2023 14:17, UK;[];['cost of living'];['warrant', 'energy', 'crackdown', 'paid', 'ofgem', 'customers', 'prepayment', 'meters', 'work', 'youre', 'meter', 'bills'];"Too many people are on pay-as-you-go energy meters that risk them being cut off paying more, Ofgem, charities and the government have said.

The regulator has said it will take legal action against any supplier that forces customers onto a prepayment meter and the government is issuing firms with a ""cease and desist"" order.

It comes as courts are overwhelmed with warrant requests from suppliers - despite rules in place to stop forced switches.

How do prepayment meters work?

Prepayment meters are pay-as-you go gas and electricity meters. They can be topped up online or with a card at certain shops and post offices.

About four million UK households have them.

They are mostly used by people who are struggling financially - as they allow you to pay for small amounts at a time.

But this means that when the money runs out, your electricity and heating switch off. Three million people ran out of credit on their prepaid meter last year, according to Citizens Advice.

When someone is unable to pay their energy bills and has fallen behind on them significantly, energy providers seek to switch them onto a prepaid meter - so they stop getting access to energy they haven't paid for.

According to Ofgem, this is being done by several firms without customers' knowledge.

What are the risks?

The households on prepayment meters in the UK largely fall into these groups:

People living in social housing

People who have moved into a property where the previous tenants had issues with their bills

People who have had issues with credit or their bills themselves

""People on prepayment meters are usually people who are financially vulnerable,"" Erik Porter, head of financial wellbeing at Wagestream, tells Sky News.

Prepayment meters are charged at different rates to pay-monthly tariffs - and traditionally have been far more expensive.

This is still the case in some circumstances, but the energy crisis has changed things.

""With the increase in energy prices and the government's energy price guarantee, we're all largely paying the same, very high price for energy,"" Mr Porter says.

He adds: ""If your meter runs out at 3am and you don't live in a city where shops stay open all night, you're going to struggle to top up. At the moment you're also going to be doing that in -5C.

""You're also expecting to people have cash in their pockets when they need it.

""If you need to top up on Monday but don't get paid until Tuesday, you're going to have to use credit or an overdraft, which with high interest rates will keep you trapped in that downward spiral.""

Citizens' Advice, End Fuel Poverty and the Labour Party are calling for a total ban on force-fitting prepayment meters when bills aren't paid to put barriers between people and disconnection.

But this would mean more bailiffs getting involved in cases - instead of resolving debt by prepaid meter or a payment plan - which the government wants to avoid.

What are the rules around them?

If someone hasn't paid their energy bills, their supplier has several ways to get them to repay the debt.

One of these is by installing a prepayment meter.

According to Ofgem, getting a court warrant to force-fit a prepayment meter should be a ""last resort"" after ""all reasonable steps have been taken to agree payment"".

Customers who become subject to a warrant are charged £150 for the process and then have to repay their debt when they next top up - or some of that debt via a payment plan.

Energy companies can't force prepayment meters on very vulnerable people - and many of them have vulnerability pledges to protect people with young children and those unable to safeguard their welfare as a result of age, health, a disability or severe financial insecurity. The pledges are not legally binding, however.

You also can't be disconnected over winter (1 October to 31 March) if you are of pension age, disabled or chronically ill.

What is the government saying?

Business and Energy Secretary Grant Shapps has written to energy suppliers with a cease-and-desist order on force-fitting prepayment meters.

He has also demanded data on the number of warrants requested to ""name and shame"" the worst offenders.

""Suppliers are clearly jumping the gun and moving at-risk customers onto prepayment meters before offering them the support they are entitled to - I simply cannot believe that every possible alternative has been exhausted in all these cases,"" he said.

""Rather than immediately reaching for a new way to extract money out of customers, I want suppliers to stop this practice and lend a more sympathetic ear, offering the kind of forbearance and support that a vulnerable customer struggling to pay should be able to expect.""

258;Spotify cuts 6% of workforce as tech sector jobs cull continues apace;Monday 23 January 2023 13:04, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];['week', 'workforce', 'sector', 'cuts', 'continues', 'pressures', 'tech', 'firm', 'latest', 'cull', 'chief', 'apace', 'global', 'worlds', 'war', 'spotify', 'jobs'];"Spotify has become the latest company in the technology sphere to announce big job cuts, with 6% of the workforce to go in the coming months.

The US listed but Sweden-based music streaming firm said a broader shake-up of its operations would see its chief content officer Dawn Ostroff leave the business.

The number of employees set to depart would total around 600 people - based on the company's last official count.

Spotify said it was to take a severance-related charge of between €35m (£30.7m and €45m (£39.6m).

Shares rose by more than 4% in pre-market trading.

It is the latest household name to cut large numbers of jobs in a bid to save cash as the global economy remains under intense pressure from the fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine.

The invasion, last February, exacerbated pressures in the global supply chain as it forced up costs with inflation - and rising interest rates to help tackle the price pressures - denting demand among consumers and business customers alike.

Fears remain of a recession in the world's largest economy.

Companies such as Spotify, Google parent firm Alphabet and Facebook's Meta have each reported a slowdown in key advertising revenues.

Maxwell, 61, is serving a 20-year sentence after she was found guilty in 2021 of luring girls to massage rooms for the disgraced financier to molest between 1994 and 2004.

In a new interview to be broadcast on TalkTV on Monday evening, the disgraced British socialite speaks from her prison in Florida.

Regarding the victims, she said: ""Epstein died, and they should take their disappointment and upset out on the authorities that allowed that to happen.

""I hope that they have some closure by the judicial process that took place.""

Last year, she gave her first interview from prison when she said she accepted she could no longer be friends with Prince Andrew.

In the new interview, she repeats her claim that the now infamous photo of her, Andrew, and a young Virginia Giuffre is not genuine.

Clips released ahead of the interview's broadcast show her saying: ""It's a fake. I don't believe it's real for a second, in fact I'm sure it's not.""

Ms Giuffre - formerly known as Virginia Roberts - used the image as evidence to support her allegations against the prince before the case was settled outside of court last year.

She sued the duke for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was 17 after she was trafficked by Epstein, the former partner of Maxwell.

The placard, which also featured an illustration of a guillotine, was pictured during a demonstration outside Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on Saturday.

The rally was held in protest of the UK government's decision to block Holyrood's Gender Recognition Reform (GRR) Bill from being officially signed into law.

The SNP's Kaukab Stewart MSP, Kirsten Oswald MP, Stewart McDonald MP and Alison Thewliss MP have come under fierce criticism after being pictured and videoed in front of the sign.

A party spokesperson said the politicians were unaware of the placard at the time.

'TERF' is an acronym for trans-exclusionary radical feminists and is often used in reference to opponents of gender identity reforms or those critical of the transgender rights movement.

'I have many qualities, but having eyes in the back of my head isn't one of them'

All four politicians condemned the sign.

Ms Stewart, MSP for Glasgow Kelvin, said she was ""not aware of these hateful signs"" and ""utterly disagree with them"".

Replying to a tweet, Ms Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, said: ""I have many qualities, but having eyes in the back of my head isn't one of them.

""If I had seen the sign you're referring to, I'd have told the person involved how inappropriate and offensive it was, and to get rid of it.""

Ms Oswald, MP for East Renfrewshire, branded it ""horrific"", adding that it ""most certainly doesn't represent my views"" and had ""no place in the peaceful movement for LGBT equality and democracy"".

While Mr McDonald, MP for Glasgow South, said: ""The violent sign at [Saturday's] rally is utterly heinous and condemned without question. I suspect it may even be unlawful.

""The moron who made it and is holding it has done those protesting for trans equality and democracy no favours - quite the opposite.""

Harry Potter author JK Rowling took a swipe at the politicians, posting on Twitter: ""A strange new form of temporary blindness has broken out among Scottish politicians.

""None of them could read placards calling for violence against women while standing inches away from them, yet they were instantly cured when photos of them posing with the signs hit the press.""

Police Scotland has since launched a probe following complaints and said enquiries are ongoing.

Joanna Cherry, SNP MP for Edinburgh South West, welcomed the police investigation as she defended her colleagues most likely being unaware of the sign behind them.

The politician claimed had the sign called for such violence against trans people, ""everyone would have rightly been up in arms"".

She added that ""violent misogyny is hiding in plain sight and it's time it was taken seriously before a woman is seriously killed or injured"".

""Women like me, JK Rowling, Rosie Duffield and others who have been on the receiving end of rape and death threats know this all too well.

""Signs such as those we saw on Saturday threatening murderous violence against any other group would cause outrage, but they are commonplace at such demonstrations.

""I'd like to see the leaders of the parties of all parliamentarians present on Saturday squarely condemn what occurred.""

The SNP stated that any violent or hateful language is ""unacceptable"".

Speaking on behalf of the party's MPs and MSPs, an SNP spokesperson said: ""SNP MSPs and MPs attended [the] protest in defence of Scottish democracy and the rights of trans people.

""Violent or hateful language - of any kind - is unacceptable and has no place in the peaceful movement for LGBT equality and democracy.""

'This behaviour is totally unacceptable'

Murdo Fraser, Conservative MSP for Mid-Scotland and Fife, reported the sign to Police Scotland and has since given a statement to officers.

He also confirmed that police are currently investigating an online threat of violence against JK Rowling ""for her gender critical views"", which the force confirmed.

His co-defendant Oludewa Okorosobo, 28, of Flaxman Road, Camberwell, south London, denied two counts of robbery and was cleared by the jury.

It comes after the court heard how the Olympic cyclist had a ""Rambo-style"" knife held against his face by balaclava-wearing men, who broke into his home and stole a pair of watches.

The 37-year-old and his wife, Peta, were woken up when the intruders broke into the property in Ongar, Essex, at around 2.30am on 27 November 2021.

After hearing noise coming from downstairs, Mrs Cavendish went to investigate.

After spotting the intruders, she attempted to shout to her husband to get back into the bedroom.

Mr Cavendish, who at the time was recovering from a cycling injury, attempted to press a panic alarm but was jumped on by an intruder who began punching him in the head.

He told the court that one of the men took out a knife and ""held it in my face"" before threatening to ""stab him up"" in front of his children.

Two Richard Mille watches, worth £400,000 and £300,000, were taken in the robbery.

The Olympic silver medalist, widely regarded as one of the greatest road sprinter cyclists of all time, told jurors that as a brand ambassador of the luxury watchmaker he is sometimes loaned custom-made timepieces to wear.

A phone and a Louis Vuitton suitcase belonging to Mr Cavendish's wife were also taken.

Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai, 21, stabbed Thomas Roberts, also 21, outside Subway in Bournemouth, Dorset, in March last year.

Mr Roberts had been acting as a peacemaker after his friend, James Medway, got into an argument with Abdulrahimzai over an e-scooter they both wanted, Salisbury Crown Court was told.

Abdulrahimzai, who arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker from Afghanistan in 2019, had admitted manslaughter but was found guilty of murder by majority verdict on Monday.

After the verdict, it was revealed that Abdulrahimzai fatally shot two people in Serbia in 2018. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison in his absence.

During his UK trial, the jury was told the defendant had claimed the scooter for himself and left it propped up against the window of Subway in the early hours of the morning.

The altercation between him and Mr Roberts - which lasted 24 seconds - involved the victim slapping the defendant in the face.

Abdulrahimzai then pulled out a knife he had hidden and stabbed Mr Roberts twice, the jury was told.

He then fled to some nearby woodland, burying the knife, his trousers, a jacket and an Afghan flag that he was wearing as a scarf.

But his mobile phone fell out of his pocket on the way, allowing police to trace it to his home address.

When he was arrested Abdulrahimzai told authorities he was 16, but it was determined at the time that he was in fact 20.

In mitigation, he said his parents had been killed and he had been tortured by the Taliban, which is why he carried a knife for self-protection.

But in the months before the incident, Abdulrahimzai shared pictures of himself posing with a large knife on TikTok.

He had also been seen carrying a knife by his foster parent, who had warned him not to, along with police and social workers who had stressed to him the dangers of carrying a knife.

267;F-16 fighter jets: What are they and could they be sent to help Ukraine?;Monday 23 January 2023 15:40, UK;['michael drummond', '@mikerdrummond'];['ukraine'];['jets', 'ingram', 'systems', 'f16', 'western', 'help', 'tanks', 'ukraine', 'f16s', 'aircraft', 'russian', 'sent', 'fighter'];"Could F-16 fighter jets soon be screaming over Kharkiv or breaking the sound barrier as they tear through the skies above Zaporizhzhia?

It once seemed impossible, but now? Maybe not.

As the Western world looks to Germany for a decision over Leopard 2 tanks, it was from the Netherlands that a possibly more radical idea was floated: sending Western-made fighter planes to Kyiv for use by Ukrainian pilots.

The Dutch cabinet said will look into supplying F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine if the Kyiv government asks for them, the country's media have reported.

During a parliamentary debate last week, foreign affairs minister Wopke Hoekstra said the cabinet would look at such a request with an ""open mind"".

So what are F-16s and what could they be used for? And what other weapons could be donated to Ukraine in the coming months?

F-16 Fighting Falcon

A highly manoeuvrable fighter jet, the F-16 is versatile and can reach speeds of more than 1,200mph.

It can locate targets in all weather conditions and detect low-flying aircraft in radar ground clutter, the US says.

In an air-to-surface role, the F-16 can fly more than 500 miles, deliver its payload with high accuracy, defend itself against enemy aircraft, and return to its starting point.

The Netherlands - a member of NATO - is one of a number of countries worldwide that flies F-16s as part of its air force.

""I think it's likely that we'll start to see more Western military aircraft being given to Ukraine - Ukrainians need it,"" former intelligence officer Philip Ingram tells Sky News.

He said the difficulty is that pilots can't just switch from flying one aircraft to another - especially at the intensity of live combat operations.

""But what we're finding across the board with the Ukrainians coming in and learning to take over and operate Western equipment is they're doing in weeks what it takes months for Western pilots to do,"" Mr Ingram added.

Asked about what the impact of a squadron of F-16s piloted by Ukrainians would be, he said it would have a psychological effect on Russian forces.

""They're up against a system that they know can outmatch them at any stage,"" he said, arguing that it would push Russian air operations further back.

Boris Johnson makes surprise visit to Ukraine

Image: Will Polish MiG-29 fighters be sent to Ukraine?

Mikoyan MiG-29

The Soviet-designed MiG-29 is already used by the Ukrainian air force and serves as a multi-role fighter plane.

The collapse and breakup of the Soviet Union mean a number of European countries have stocks of MiG-29s, including Poland.

In March last year, just weeks after the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Poland offered to supply its entire fleet of MiG-29s to Kyiv in return for F-16s from the US.

At the time the Pentagon said the offer was not ""tenable"" and ""raises serious concerns for the NATO alliance"".

However in the months since then Ukraine has mounted hugely successful counterattacks and many heavy weapons that were maybe once considered off the table - HIMARS and tanks, for example - have been donated to Kyiv.

A potential issue for the Polish MiG-29s, Mr Ingram says, is that they have been upgraded to run NATO communications systems that would potentially need to be removed to prevent them falling into Russian hands.

Asked about a possible timeline for F-16s, MiG-29s or other fixed-wing aircraft for Ukraine, Mr Ingram pointed to the next Ramstein air base meeting in mid-February which is expected to focus on aviation.

ATACMS long-range missiles

Ukraine has long been calling for more and longer-range missile systems as they continue to strike targets deep behind Russian lines.

The arrival of the HIMARS rocket system was arguably one of the biggest developments in the war and has undoubtedly played a huge role in underpinning Ukraine's counteroffensives.

With a range of around 190 miles Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) would be a step up in range from the HIMARS being used in Ukraine, which has a range of around 50 miles.

On a visit to Kyiv last week with two other US senators, Richard Blumenthal urged the Biden administration to supply Ukraine with tanks, artillery, and ATACMS missile systems, as well as planes.

""We should not send American troops to Ukraine, but we should provide Ukraine with whatever we would give our troops if they were fighting on the ground,"" Mr Blumenthal said.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123154804/http://news.sky.com/story/f-16-fighter-jets-what-are-they-and-could-they-be-sent-to-help-ukraine-12793368

Office of Rail and Road data shows the cancellations score for all operators during the four weeks to 7 January was 8%, which was double the proportion from the previous period.

Avanti West Coast cancelled the equivalent of about one in five services and registered a cancellations score of 18.9% - one of the highest figures recorded for any operator in records dating back to April 2014.

Southeastern had the second worst cancellations score with 12.2%, which was its most on record.

It was followed by Govia Thameslink Railway - which consists of Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express - and TransPennine Express, which both had a score of 11.9%.

Cancellations scores reflect the percentage of services that are either fully or part-cancelled, with part-cancellations counted as half a full cancellation.

Labour said ""13 years of Conservative failure"" had left the nation with ""second-rate infrastructure and rail services in crisis"" - and accused ministers of handing over ""millions in taxpayer-funded performance bonuses to failing operators"".

But a Department for Transport spokeswoman said: ""We are working closely with train operators to ensure disruption is kept to a minimum and long-term solutions are put in place, including the swift recruitment and training of new drivers.""

The statistics do not include services removed from timetables after 10pm the previous day, which means the impact on passengers is likely to have been worse than the figures suggest.

A rail industry source noted the reliability figures cover a period when operators were badly affected by an overtime ban introduced as part of industrial action.

The airport recorded its coldest night since December 2010 - and coldest January night since 1987 - as temperatures dropped to -8.4C (16.8F).

Slippery and icy conditions on runways meant carriers were forced to cancel or delay arrivals and departures to and from the airport.

British Airways was among the airlines affected earlier and grounded around 80 flights due to the wintry weather conditions.

A British Airways spokesman said: ""Like other airlines, our schedule has been affected by the continued freezing fog weather conditions experienced across London.

""We've apologised to customers whose flights have been affected and are doing everything we can to get them on their way as quickly as possible.

""We advise customers to check the website for the latest flight information.""

A Heathrow spokesman said poor visibility this morning resulted in ""minor changes"" to the flight schedule.

""While there may be minor changes to today's schedule as a result of the weather, we want to reassure passengers that our colleagues are working in close collaboration with our airline and air traffic control partners to get them safely away on their journeys as quickly as possible.

""We encourage passengers to check with their airline for the latest information.""

The situation improved and the fog had largely dissipated by the afternoon.

William Shawcross, the Commissioner for Public Appointments, said he would review the competition which led to Richard Sharp's appointment while Mr Johnson was prime minister.

He made the announcement in response to a request from shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell.

He said: ""The role of the commissioner is to oversee the public appointments process and ensure appointments are made fairly, openly and on merit.

""I intend to review this competition to assure myself and the public that the process was run in compliance with the government's governance code for public appointments.""

The Sunday Times reported Mr Sharp was involved in arranging a guarantor on a loan of up to £800,000 for Mr Johnson in late 2020, and that the then-prime minister went on to recommend him for the top job at the BBC.

Earlier on Monday, the chairman asked for the BBC to review any potential conflicts of interest he may currently have to ensure that ""all appropriate guidelines have been followed"" since he joined the broadcaster.

""We have many challenges at the BBC and I know that distractions such as this are not welcome,"" he said in a statement read out on BBC News.

The review will not look at his links to Mr Johnson's loan, but in a letter to BBC staff, Mr Sharp clarified some of the details surrounding the Sunday Times report.

He confirmed he introduced multimillionaire Canadian businessman Sam Blyth to cabinet secretary Simon Case ""as Sam wanted to support Boris Johnson"".

""I was not involved in making a loan, or arranging a guarantee, and I did not arrange any financing. What I did do was to seek an introduction of Sam Blyth to the relevant official in government,"" he said.

""Sam Blyth, who I have known for more than forty years, lives in London and having become aware of the financial pressures on the then-prime minister, and being a successful entrepreneur, he told me he wanted to explore whether he could assist.""

Mr Blyth is a distance cousin of Mr Johnson's.

The statement was released moments after Mr Johnson said that Mr Sharp ""knows absolutely nothing about my personal finances"".

Speaking to Sky News he said: ""This is a load of complete nonsense - absolute nonsense.

""Let me just tell you, Richard Sharp is a great and wise man but he knows absolutely nothing about my personal finances - I can tell you that for 100% ding-dang sure.

""This is just another example of the BBC disappearing up its own fundament.""

The BBC reported that Mr Sharp ""has agreed with the board's senior independent director"" that the nominations committee will look at conflicts of interest when it next meets and, ""in the interests of transparency, publish the conclusions"".

Timeline November 2020:

According to the Sunday Times the loan guarantee was first suggested by Canadian millionaire Sam Blyth during a dinner with Richard Sharp. Early December 2020:

In early December, Richard Sharp put Sam Blyth in contact with the Cabinet Secretary, Simon Case. Late 2020:

Before the end of the year, Richard Sharp and Sam Blyth met with Boris Johnson for dinner at his country residence, Chequers. They insist the prime minister's finances were not discussed. January 2021:

At the start of January, the government announced Richard Sharp as the preferred candidate to be BBC chairman.

Ms Powell said there also needed to be an independent investigation into the hiring process ""to satisfy the public and parliament of its integrity. ""

The party has also reported Mr Johnson to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, saying the former prime minister's financial affairs are ""dragging the Conservative Party deeper into yet another quagmire of sleaze"".

The Cabinet Office has insisted Mr Sharp was appointed ""following a rigorous appointments process"".

This included assessment by a panel of experts and ""additional pre-appointment scrutiny by a House of Commons Select Committee"", according to a statement released yesterday.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123154804/http://news.sky.com/story/investigation-launched-into-appointment-process-of-bbc-chairman-after-boris-johnson-loan-claim-12793498

272;I tried the Octopus Energy saving sessions - can sitting in the dark really save you £100 off your bill?;Monday 23 January 2023 15:48, UK;['megan baynes', '@megbaynes'];['cost of living'];['energy', 'low', 'sessions', 'bill', 'demand', 'saving', 'hours', 'really', 'save', 'tried', 'dark', 'usage', 'peak', 'sitting', 'savings', 'octopus'];"The promise of up to £100 off your energy bill seems like a great deal, all for the price of turning off your lights for a few short hours.

But can sitting in the dark really save you £100?

Households are being promised savings if they cut back their electricity use during certain peak hours - with the first real run of the Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) taking place tonight and into tomorrow.

It seems like a no-brainer amid an energy crisis that has left millions struggling with their monthly payments.

Cost of living latest: Some food firms rising prices 'unnecessarily'

This is the first time the National Grid has ordered the DFS be used - prior to that, it was just used as test runs, to see if the system could work in theory.

I'm with Octopus Energy and opted into their Saving Sessions as soon as they became available on the app. The energy provider has run five since November.

Of these, I opted into four (I forgot to click to opt into one on the 30 November) and diligently turned off the electricity as much as possible during the set time periods.

Washing machine? Off. Lights? Off. TV? Off. Heating? Off.

Advertisement

I even timed to be out during one of them, to guarantee I wasn't using any electricity.

My savings so far? £2.36.

How it works

The scheme reportedly compares usage against a customer's usual demand and pays £3 for every unit or kilowatt hour (kWh) saved.

It will help avoid the need for emergency generators to be used or blackouts to be enforced when the grid comes under pressure during peak times this winter.

It was first trialled by Octopus Energy on 1 November, with other firms following suit, but the scheme is now officially under way after successful tests last year.

So far, 26 energy suppliers have signed up, and it will stay in place until March.

Does it work for smaller households?

I only live with one other person - unless you count the two cats - which means our energy usage is already relatively low, and we struggled to cut back any further. This resulted in very minimal savings through the scheme.

We use the washing machine a few times a week (at most) and already did it during the day, and my irregular work hours mean I often cook dinner later at night after peak time has already passed.

Like us, if you already have fairly low energy usage - or use it mainly out of peak demand - you may find you can't quite cut back to the percentage required to save money. Indeed, during two of the sessions, we didn't save a single penny (including one time when we went weren't in the property).

I am also reluctant to turn off any of the constantly-on appliances in my home (the fridge and freezer) because if I'm only going to be saving a few pennies, is it worth the risk of all my food going rancid?

Other customers with similarly low usage have also struggled to make savings.

""We've done it a few times - literally sat in the dark with some candles around us,"" one tweeted Octopus Energy. ""With so many homes being pretty energy efficient, it's very difficult to make savings on electricity.""

In response, the energy company said: ""If you're already a pretty low user during the slot, you might not see a big saving.

""But every little bit counts here and everyone who contributes makes a massive difference. You can also opt out if you feel these sessions aren't for you.""

Image: During two saving sessions, we saved no money

'It just takes a bit of planning'

However, each person's energy use is subjective.

Karen Gibbons from Gillingham, Dorset lives with her three-year-old daughter and told Sky News she has saved £32 so far - which she cashed in on her December bill from Octopus Energy.

""I followed the tips, like if you are going to switch off your heating, heat your house up until that point, but don't sit there being cold,"" she told Sky News.

She swaps to using her washing machine during the day and makes sure not to charge her electric vehicle during the sessions.

""I think things like turning lights off doesn't make that much of a difference - it's making sure the appliances and heating are off.""

""My daughter is at nursery over lunchtime, so she gets a hot meal, so I don't have to do a hot meal for her tea,"" she added.

""And she likes to watch a bit of programming on her tablet so I make sure that is charged beforehand.

""It just requires a little bit of planning but it has worked out well.""

Image: We did get more savings during some of the later sessions

Is it worth it?

It's never a bad idea to consider how much energy you use and try to cut back (whatever time of day) and you lose absolutely nothing from opting in.

In fact, despite my minimal savings, I would recommend anyone who can sign up for the scheme does so - every penny counts.

Households who were already using a lot of energy during peak hours (5pm to 9pm) will likely find they save more by shifting their schedules around by an hour. But for smaller households, or those with irregular hours, be aware that your rewards may be much lower than the promised £100.

Plus, the main reason behind these sessions isn't really money - it's reducing the UK's energy consumption in a bid to prevent blackouts.

So I'll continue to sign up for every session, and dutifully turn off most of the appliances in my home, at the very least to try and take some pressure off the National Grid.

And who knows - maybe this session will be the one where I save enough to make it worth it.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123164853/http://news.sky.com/story/i-tried-the-octopus-energy-saving-sessions-can-sitting-in-the-dark-really-save-you-100-off-your-bill-12793459

The FA is calling for a harsher punishment for the 63-year-old former Crawley Town manager.

An FA Spokesperson said: ""We are appealing the sanction imposed by the Independent Panel on John Yems. We believe a longer sanction is appropriate. We are unable to comment further until the appeal is complete.""

Yems was found guilty of 11 offences and admitted to one charge over a series of offensive comments made between 2019 and 2022 while he managed the League Two club.

The FA's independent panel found he had referenced his players' ethnic origin and colour and banned him for 18 months, but found that he was ""not a conscious racist"" nor did he ""ever intend to make racist remarks"".

The panel's decisions caused dismay at the FA and football's anti-racism body Kick It Out.

The FA told Sky News: ""We had requested a longer ban. Based on the evidence presented to the commission, we don't agree that the panel should have found that this was not a case of conscious racism.""

A sanctions document indicates the FA pushed for a two-year suspension.

Kick It Out said the findings set a ""dangerous precedent"" by allowing a perpetrator to claim harmful language was ""banter"".

It said: ""The behaviour outlined in the report must be called out for exactly what it is: racism and Islamophobia.""

It added that the ban was a ""slap in the face of the victims of the discriminatory abuse"" detailed in the report and to those who faced racism or Islamophobia.

Kick It Out CEO Tony Burnett told Sky Sports News: ""I don't know John Yems, but unless the FA are channelling some sort of superpower that I'm not aware of, they have no jurisdiction and they're actually not qualified to assess whether any individual is a racist or not.

""So how you can reach a conclusion like that in a case like this is completely beyond me.""

Yems was fired from Crawley in May 2022.

New pictures show Reign Passey, from Dudley in the West Midlands, in her hospital bed as she battled the extremely rare infection.

Reign spent three weeks in hospital after suspected Strep A bacteria triggered necrotising fasciitis - a rare disease that can occur after a wound is infected that can result in death.

She underwent a four-hour operation to remove dead tissue to prevent the infection from spreading further which resulted in a large scar, according to MailOnline.

Reign's mother Leanne said she had to argue with doctors just to get an examination during her daughter's illness.

""It's horrendous, you never expect it to happen to you until it does,"" the 31-year-old said.

""I just want people to understand that it's so serious.""

It is believed the infection may have entered Reign's body through a chickenpox sore.

Three days after contracting chickenpox last July, Ms Passey noticed her daughter was fatigued, had a temperature and a red ring around one of the sores.

A GP advised that Reign go to A&E; immediately.

But medics at Russells Hall Hospital told Ms Passey to go home because Reign's chickenpox was highly contagious and they had no beds available.

""By this point the red ring had almost tripled in size,"" Ms Passey said.



""They were adamant they were too busy, she was too contagious and I needed to take her home.

""I said the only way I was leaving was if they kicked me out - she was deteriorating by the second.""

The mother and daughter eventually went to a second hospital, Birmingham Children's Hospital.

But they were told to wait outside to avoid infecting others with chickenpox.

""We got to the hospital at 9.30pm - we sat there until 3.30am,"" Ms Passey said.

""Between those times, her temperature had gone up to almost 42C, she was hallucinating and talking to me.

""She'd gone past the point of screaming and was lying there almost lifeless.""

After an 11-hour wait at the hospital, Reign was finally seen by doctors and rushed to have emergency surgery.

As well as cutting away a large amount of dead tissue, surgeons had to keep the wound open for cleaning and examination to ensure every trace of the bacteria had been removed.

Reign was put into an induced coma for the pain and breathing support. But then the young girl contracted sepsis and after recovering was sent to the hospital's burns unit for skin grafts for the wound.

A spokesperson for Birmingham Women's and Children's NHS Foundation Trust, which manages Birmingham Children's Hospital, defended its decision to make Reign and her mother sit outside but told MailOnline they hoped she was recovering well.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Malling Health, which operates the Dudley Urgent Care Centre at the Russells Hall Hospital said they were ""sorry to hear"" about Reign's experience but could not comment on specific cases due to patient confidentiality.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123174742/http://news.sky.com/story/girl-4-left-fighting-for-her-life-after-suspected-strep-a-turned-into-flesh-eating-disease-12793689
275;Pet fish spend cash and expose Nintendo Switch owner's credit card during Pokemon live stream;Monday 23 January 2023 16:51, UK;[];['gaming', 'nintendo'];['switch', 'stream', 'swimming', 'live', 'expose', 'nintendo', 'managed', 'spend', 'game', 'pokemon', 'pet', 'latest', 'card', 'owners', 'fish', 'mutekimaru'];"Pet fish have spent money and revealed their owner's credit card details to thousands of people during a live stream.

The unlikely incident happened during an unusual experiment by a Japanese YouTuber, who wanted to see if his fish could complete a video game by themselves.

Using a webcam pointed at their fishbowl and motion-tracking software to monitor their movements and translate them into button inputs, Mutekimaru set up his fish to play the latest Pokemon title on Nintendo Switch.

Footage shows them swimming across a grid mapped on to their bowl, with each square labelled with a command on the Switch's controller.

The fish had managed to complete a previous game in the series - and it only took north of 3,000 hours.

On this occasion, they had been playing for more than 1,100 hours when the game crashed, which is perhaps not a surprise, given the latest Pokemon games have been criticised for being prone to bugs.

Mutekimaru was away from his streaming setup when it happened - and the Switch continued to accept button commands from the fish.

Eventually, they managed to navigate to the console's store.

From there, the fish managed to add 500 yen (£3.10) to Mutekimaru's account using the credit card that was stored on his Switch - and expose the card details to everyone watching.

The fish also triggered a download from the store, had PayPal send their owner a confirmation email and changed their account name.

Nintendo seemed to take a sympathetic view of the situation, as Mutekimaru said the company granted a refund.

280;Cost of living: Social energy tariff needed for families that can't pay bills even with government help, Ofgem says;Monday 23 January 2023 16:59, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];['cost of living', 'paul kelso'];['energy', 'vulnerable', 'living', 'ofgem', 'needed', 'customers', 'prices', 'prepayment', 'families', 'brearley', 'suppliers', 'help', 'meters', 'pay', 'cost', 'tariff', 'social'];"The government should introduce a ""social tariff"" guaranteeing cheaper energy to vulnerable users who cannot afford their basic needs, the chief executive of regulator Ofgem has said.

Speaking as Ofgem launched an investigation into energy suppliers imposing prepayment meters on struggling households, Jonathan Brearley said the current high-cost energy market left some households simply unable to pay.

Ofgem's investigation comes after Business Secretary Grant Shapps wrote to energy suppliers raising concerns over an increase in customers forced to move to prepay meters having fallen behind on regular payments.

Companies could face legal action if Ofgem determines they have moved customers to prepayment without exploring other options to support them.

Mr Brearley said action was needed to address the fundamental problem caused by the tripling of gas prices in the last year.

""There are families that can't afford to pay their energy bills and we will be active with companies to examine how they deal with those who fall into arrears,"" Mr Brearley said.

""But the root cause is that some customers, despite enormous widespread support from the government, don't have the ability to pay for their basic energy needs.

""We think there's a case to examine with urgency a social tariff that limits the impact of extremely high prices, which reduces the volatility for a defined set of vulnerable groups.""

Mr Brearley said the tariff would have to be subsidised during periods of high energy prices, and otherwise paid for with ""funds raised in a progressive way"", adding that ""energy bills are not a progressive tax base"".

His intervention comes after charities called on Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to consider a social tariff to address the growing number of people for whom energy is becoming unaffordable.

Citizens Advice estimates 3.2 million customers were left in cold and dark homes last year after running out of credit.

Mandatory prepayment meters are intended as a last resort for customers who suppliers believe are refusing to pay rather than simply unable and should only be used after exploring the financial help available.

Concerns over spike in prepayment meter warrants

Ofgem says there has been a spike in the number of forced installations or customers being switched via smart metres in recent months.

""I am concerned about the sharp growth in households struggling to pay their bills being switched over to prepayment meters, sometimes without their even knowing about it, leaving them without heating,"" Mr Brearley said in a speech at the Institute for Government on Monday.

""I have heard directly from people who have faced poor practice from suppliers. It is simply not acceptable that vulnerable customers are left in the dark and cold in winter.""

How do prepayment meters work?

The withdrawal of Russian gas from European supply, increased competition for alternative sources, and a reduction in output from the French nuclear fleet have combined to drive up wholesale gas prices, which effectively set the base rate for electricity production.

While the market has settled since last summer Mr Brearley said there is no prospect of a return to lower prices that were normal before the coronavirus pandemic.

""Mild weather, improved storage in Europe, and a more benign trading environment... has led to a challenging but more robust energy security position,"" he said.

""But prices are unlikely to fall back to pre-pandemic levels... we need to be ready for a world where prices are high and volatile.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123174742/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-social-energy-tariff-needed-for-families-that-cant-pay-bills-even-with-government-help-ofgem-says-12793579
281;NASA's James Webb Space Telescope finds signs of 'building blocks for life' in icy clouds;Monday 23 January 2023 16:17, UK;[];['james webb space telescope', 'space'];['james', 'region', 'finds', 'team', 'icy', 'webb', 'space', 'star', 'nasas', 'cloud', 'light', 'life', 'telescope', 'signs', 'clouds'];"Molecular species that form the ""building blocks for life"" have been found in a deep space region of icy clouds.

Using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, a team of astronomers and scientists confirmed the presence of methane and ethanol, as well as small compounds with nitrogen and sulphur.

On Earth, sources of methane include emissions from wetlands, oceans, landfills and raising cattle, while most ethanol comes from fermenting starches and sugars.

They were discovered some 500 light years from Earth, in a region where temperatures range from -270C to -250C that had never before been observed.

The international team spent 30 hours observing two areas in the dense and difficult-to-investigate Chameleon I molecular cloud, where dozens of young stars are forming.

NASA's powerful telescope sent back detailed images and data, from which the so-called Ice Age scientists could identify molecules.

The image at the top of this article shows the central region of Chameleon I, with the cold, wispy cloud in blue, illuminated by the glow of a young star (seen in orange).

It's the light from that star and others in the background that are used to detect ices in the cloud, which absorb the starlight passing through them.

""This is exciting for two reasons,"" Professor Martin McCoustra, an astrochemist, said.

""One is that it makes us more confident in the conditions we're recreating in our laboratories.

""The second is that these molecules are the materials from which the building blocks for life are made.

""We are increasingly certain that many of the components of the organic soup from which life evolved had an extra-terrestrial origin and were generated as a natural part of the process of forming the sun and solar system.""

Space's 'inhospitable environments'

The telescope was used as part of a programme through which it is granted to scientific projects to aid their research.

It is hoped that the Ice Age team will be able to use it again for further observations of these icy regions of space.

Professor McCoustra, of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, said the telescope was key to discovering more about space's most ""inhospitable environments"".

""To see the icy dust grains in space, you need to use a star as a source of light to shine through and illuminate them,"" he said.

""It's the same as we do in the laboratory, of course on a much grander scale.""

He added: ""We're confirming that what we see and recreate in our laboratories is what happens in space.

""This makes us more confident that chemistry in icy environments is the main pathway to forming the chemical precursors to life found in the primordial chemical soup.""

Isla Bryson is alleged to have raped a woman in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, in 2016 and another in Drumchapel, Glasgow, in 2019.

The High Court in Glasgow had been told in agreed evidence that Bryson now identifies as a transgender woman, but was previously known as Adam Graham.

Bryson, 31, told the court that she knew she was transgender at the age of four but did not make the decision to transition until she was 29, and is currently taking hormones and seeking surgery to complete gender reassignment.

Edward Targowski KC, for the defence, described the three main witnesses in the trial as ""vulnerable"", adding: ""And that includes Isla Bryson.""

Mr Targowski spoke about Bryson's gender, saying: ""If you accept that evidence, that she is transitioning, that she is aiming to continue on that path to becoming female gender, that goes a long way to acquitting her of these charges.""

Bryson claims all sex was consensual.

Mr Targowski added: ""Where I do take issue with the trial and advocate depute is that there is no way Isla Bryson could be described as a predatory male.

""This is not the sort of case we are in.""

Advocate depute John Keenan argued there was ""clear evidence"" of a lack of consent in both the alleged victims' accounts, which he described as ""credible and reliable"".

Mr Keenan stated: ""He [the accused] was too strong and she couldn't push him off, she said no, loudly, on multiple occasions.

""She continued to try and push him off but he said no.""

""She told the accused to stop, that she couldn't breathe, that she didn't want to. The accused did not stop.""

In response to Bryson's evidence, Mr Keenan said the accused's account was ""entirely incredible and unreliable"".

His vision seemed to be one of getting things done efficiently and drama-free rather than lurching from one self-inflicted scandal to another.

But as he is quickly finding out, it's easier said than done.

And so he has begun 2023 with a new set of sleaze allegations.

The characters and the plot lines though are all too familiar.

Firstly, Conservative Party chair Nadhim Zahawi is accused of impropriety over his financial affairs, and not for the first time.

He has always insisted he does everything by the book, but the latest revelation that he agreed to a multimillion-pound deal after a dispute with HMRC during his time as chancellor, eventually became too embarrassing for the Prime Minister.

Under mounting pressure over the weekend, the PM eventually referred it to his ethics advisor, admitting there are ""questions to be answered"".

And as if that wasn't enough, his old frenemy Boris Johnson has proved he does not need to be in Number 10 to cause problems.

At the heart of this controversy is an issue that plagued him in office and has followed him to the backbenches.

A tendency to live well beyond his means and periodically ask for handouts has dragged down another of Johnson's willing friends, this time BBC chair Richard Sharp who helped him secure an £800,000 loan in 2020.

None of these sagas are of Sunak's making but to live up to his own high standards he will need to show he really is prepared to deal with them differently, rather than doing the bare minimum and hoping it all goes away.

The card was shown during a women's cup match between Sporting Lisbon and Benfica on Saturday after medical staff from both clubs rushed to help a fan who had fainted in the stands as Benfica led 3-0 during the first half.

Referee Catarina Campos then showed the card to both teams.

The gesture recognises and praises acts of fair play.

Fans at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon were heard cheering and applauding the decision.

The cards were introduced as part of an initiative of Portugal's National Plan for Ethics in Sport to encourage fair play and have been adopted by the Portuguese Football Federation.

So far only Portugal has adopted the white card.

They contrast yellow and red cards which are used to discipline players for misconduct.

Jared O'Mara, 41, was in ""poor mental health"" at the time and abusing the class A drug in ""prodigious quantities"", Leeds Crown Court heard.

A friend, charged alongside him, believed the politician was suffering a ""severe psychotic episode"" and feared a conspiracy against him.

It is claimed that O'Mara, who represented the Sheffield Hallam constituency between 2017 and 2019, submitted ""dishonest"" invoices to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa).

Jurors were told he made four claims between June and August 2019 from a ""fictitious"" organisation called Confident About Autism SY.

They also heard he submitted two invoices from his ""chief of staff"", Gareth Arnold, for media and PR work. Prosecutors say that work was never carried out.

O'Mara, who appeared in court by videolink on Monday, is also accused of submitting a false contract of employment for his friend John Woodliff, saying that Woodliff worked for him as a constituency support officer.

O'Mara is charged with eight counts of fraud by false representation.

Arnold is jointly charged with six of the offences, while Woodliff is jointly charged with one.

Image: John Woodliff said he 'knew it was dodgy', the court was told

Setting out his argument, prosecutor James Bourne-Arton said Arnold and Woodliff were ""old friends of Jared O'Mara and sadly were persuaded to go along with his dishonest claims"".

In the summer of 2019, however, Arnold contacted South Yorkshire Police after ""reaching a point at which he was no longer willing to participate in the fraud"", the court heard.

In a phone call played to the jury, Arnold said: ""It's a bit of a tricky one, but yesterday I spoke to the 999 service and the mental health crisis team about my employer, who I believe is suffering a severe psychotic episode and has delusions of a conspiracy against him.

""I also believe he has been submitting fake expense claims to the government very recently.""

The allegedly fraudulent invoices included £19,400 for support from Confident About Autism SY, and £4,650 for Arnold.

Mr Bourne-Arton said Confident About Autism SY was an ""invention of Jared O'Mara that he hoped to slip through as a legitimate claim, no doubt seeking to hide behind the fact that it related to his disability if ever challenged"".

There is no evidence that any training or consultancy was provided by Arnold, the prosecutor said, and ""legitimate staff"" working for O'Mara had never heard of him.

""(Ipsa) staff noted that the invoices, particularly those from Confident About Autism, are in different formats, have inconsistent references, and in one case was dated for a date after it was submitted for payment,"" Mr Bourne-Arton said.

All of the invoices were either rejected or not processed - one of them rejected three times.

Arnold described an ""undoubtedly sad state of affairs"", Mr Bourne-Arton said.

He told jurors: ""O'Mara was plainly unable to cope with the office he held, was in poor mental health and was heavily addicted to cocaine that he was abusing in prodigious quantities.""

Financial investigations revealed O'Mara was ""living to or beyond his means and in dire need of cash"", the court heard.

The prosecutor said: ""The reason for that appears to have been that he was funding a significant cocaine habit of which both Gareth Arnold and John Woodliff were plainly aware.""

The three defendants were arrested following an investigation and Woodliff, who was a nightclub doorman when O'Mara was a nightclub manager, said ""I knew it was dodgy"", jurors were told.

The court also heard that O'Mara emailed Ipsa in February 2020, falsely claiming the police investigation had been completed with no action taken, and saying he was entitled to be paid the two invoices relating to services supplied by Arnold.

O'Mara, of Walker Close, Sheffield; Arnold, of School Lane, Dronfield, Derbyshire; and Woodliff, of Hesley Road, Shiregreen, Sheffield, deny all charges.

""For me, school was the most traumatising and most difficult part of my life,"" the seven-time Formula One champion, who was born and educated in Stevenage, told the On Purpose podcast.

""I was already being bullied at the age of six. At that particular school I was one of three kids of colour and just bigger, stronger, bullying kids were throwing me around a lot of the time.

""The constant jabs, the things that are either thrown at you, like bananas, or people that would use the n-word just so relaxed. People calling you half-caste and not knowing where you fit in. That for me was difficult.""

Hamilton, 38, added: ""In my [secondary] school there were six or seven black kids out of 1,200 kids and three of us were put outside the headmaster's office all the time. The headmaster just had it out for us - and particularly me.

""I felt the system was up against me and I was swimming against the tide. There were a lot of things I suppressed.

""I didn't feel I could go home and tell my parents that these kids kept calling me the n-word, or I got bullied or beaten up at school today, I didn't want my dad to think I was not strong.""

Hamilton, who is the only black driver in F1, in recent years has established Mission 44, which aims to enhance the lives of people from under-represented groups, and Ignite, a joint enterprise with his Mercedes team to improve diversity and inclusion in motor racing.

He is entering the final year of his £40m-a-season deal with Mercedes as he prepares for his 17th season in F1.

He is expected to stay on the grid after his 40th birthday by signing a new multi-year contract.

It follows calls for an examination of patient safety after a Sky News investigation into alleged failures in the care of adolescents at mental health units run by a single provider - the Huntercombe Group, now part of Active Care Group.

Our investigation raised concerns from more than 50 former patients.

Maria Caulfield, the minister for Mental Health and Women's Health Strategy, said the review will focus on data and evidence available to healthcare services including from families and patients, and how it can be used to identify patient safety risks more effectively.

It will be chaired by Dr Geraldine Strathdee, who is currently running the Essex Mental Health Independent Inquiry into inpatient mental health deaths in Essex between 2000 and 2020. The two inquiries will run separately.

Rosena Allin-Khan, the shadow cabinet minister for Mental Health, responding to the government's written ministerial statement announcing the review, said: ""Labour has long been calling for a rapid review of these services, following numerous allegations made at several inpatient units last year.

""Patients must be prioritised - Labour has a plan to transform patient access to mental health services, ensuring one million additional people will be receiving help each year by the end of our first term in office.""

Ms Caulfield said: ""My officials will continue to work closely with their colleagues in NHS England to make sure the review is aligned with, and complementary to, the Quality Improvement programme.

""NHS England has established a three-year Quality Improvement programme which seeks to tackle the root causes of unsafe, poor-quality inpatient care in mental health, learning disability and autism settings.""

Responding to the announcement of the review she told Sky News: ""We welcome any move forward that investigates failures to date, especially with a view to prevention.

""One of the biggest failures is the disempowerment of patients and a review would not be complete without an opportunity for patient voices to be heard.

As if the prospect of Earth's biggest land mammal disappearing forever wasn't bad enough, losing them would have a potentially devastating impact on the planet's second-biggest rainforest.

The elephant population in the Congo Basin, which spans several countries in central and western Africa, has plummeted in the past decade - down 60% to an estimated 40,000, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society.

Poaching is a major cause of their decline, with thousands killed every year for their ivory tusks.

Researchers say that if the animals were to completely vanish, the Congo's rainforest - second to Brazil's Amazon - would lose up to 9% of its ability to capture atmospheric carbon.

""If we lose forest elephants, we will be doing a global disservice to climate change mitigation,"" said Stephen Blake, assistant professor of biology at Saint Louis University.

""The importance of forest elephants for climate mitigation must be taken seriously by policymakers to generate the support needed for elephant conservation.

""The role of forest elephants in our global environment is too important to ignore.""

The crucial role of elephants

Professor Blake is senior author of a new paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

His team's research describes how crucial elephants are to Africa's rainforests, maintaining their valuable status as a carbon sink, when they absorb more carbon dioxide than they emit.

Elephants favour low carbon density trees when it comes to feeding, as they are more nutritious, promoting the growth of higher carbon density trees.

The elephants' feeding habits ""thins"" the forest, which reduces competition among the trees and provides more light, space, and soil nutrients to the high carbon trees.

When elephants do feed from high carbon trees, it's the often large fruit that grows from them - the seeds from which pass through the animals' gut undamaged.

These are released in the elephants' dung, primed to germinate and grow into some of the forest's largest trees.

'Save the elephants - help save the planet'

Professor Blake hailed them as ""the gardeners of the forest"" - and said the research was yet more reason to provide them with better protection.

He added: ""As a global society, we can continue to hunt these highly social and intelligent animals and watch them become extinct, or we can find ways to stop this illegal activity.

""Save the elephants and help save the planet, it really is that simple.""

He is a slight, softly spoken young man with few distinguishing features.

His friends roar with laughter when he asks us not to show his ears on camera. It's a moment of levity, but Kawa is deadly serious.

As one of Iran's protest leaders, he is a wanted man, and the threat of imprisonment and torture hangs over him.

""At night, I'm always ready to flee if they raid our house. I have prepared everything.""

We are in a safe house over the border in northern Iraq. He's briefly left Iran but is still taking no risks - Iranian agents operate here.

""You sense the fear and terror in society,"" he admits, but adds ""morale is very high"".

""We are waiting and looking for a window to come back to the street. Anything small that happens would bring people back to the street.""

More than 500 people are estimated to have been killed since nationwide protests broke out in September, over the death of a young woman in police custody who was arrested for wearing her hijab ""incorrectly"".

Kawa thinks Iranian society is hardening against the regime. He tells me a story about one night when the feared Basij paramilitary forces fired on a mosque as they were readying bodies for burial.

""People had gone to the hospitals so the corpses would not be taken by the regime. They [the protesters] brought a body to wash it and bury it,"" he says.

""At that moment the regime fired on the mosque.

""People gathered in the mosque and the regime fired from the roof and several people were wounded. They fired on people with AK47s, firing round after round.

""There were women and children with us, and I did not see anyone with us wearing military fatigues. The way they shot at us was like they were attacking an armed group, but we were civilians.""

'More violence ahead'

Kawa also believes there will be more violence in the coming months as the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution approaches.

Sky News has been sent footage of protesters peppered with hundreds of pellets embedded in their skin. It is proof that the Iranian regime is using shotguns against the demonstrators.

We also have video of doctors working to save these patients in secret makeshift clinics in private apartments - if the protesters go for treatment in hospital they will immediately identify themselves to the regime.

The doctors are taking huge risks too, smuggling medicine and supplies out of hospitals to help the protesters.

Image: Protests in Tehran in September last year

It's proof of an extensive underground network - the anti-government feeling is deeper than street level.

""The doctors' help... is of critical importance to the wounded protesters,"" an activist inside Iran told Sky News.

""If these secret medical teams were not available, most of the wounded would most likely die because infections would spread to their bodies from their injuries.

""Some, whose medical situations were not good, had to have their hands or arms amputated.""

'People have become more daring'

Kawa will go back to Iran to continue organising the uprising. I ask him how he feels at that prospect.

""I feel it is my responsibility to go back and resume my activity until my people are free,"" he says.

Charles McGonigal, who headed the bureau's counterintelligence section in New York City from 2016 to 2018, was arrested at the city's JFK airport on Saturday after returning from the Middle East.

Most of the charges McGonigal faces relate to alleged activity that took place after he retired from the FBI in 2018.

But he is also accused of taking $225,000 (£182,000) in cash while still working as a special agent from someone who had worked for a foreign intelligence service.

From August 2017 until his retirement in September 2018, McGonigal allegedly concealed from the bureau his relationship with the ex-Albanian intelligence officer.

He allegedly received cash from the person for his own financial benefit - hiding the payment from the FBI - and travelled abroad with them, but the indictment does not characterise the payment to McGonigal as a bribe.

""Mr McGonigal betrayed his solemn oath to the United States in exchange for personal gain and at the expense of our national security,"" said FBI assistant director in charge, Donald Alway.

The 54-year-old suspect has also been separately charged with money laundering and violating sanctions on Russia after allegedly receiving concealed payments from oligarch Oleg Deripaska following McGonigal's retirement.

Deripaska, the founder of Russian aluminium company Rusal, was among those added to the US Treasury Department's sanctions list in 2018 for purported ties to the Kremlin and its energy sector in reaction to Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US election. Both Deripaska and the Kremlin deny any such interference.

McGonigal stands accused of working on a failed attempt to get sanctions against Deripaska lifted a year later and investigating a rival oligarch in 2021 on behalf of him in return for money.

On Monday, he pleaded not guilty in federal court to violating US sanctions on Russia.

Prosecutors claim McGonigal, and an interpreter and Deripaska associate called Sergei Shestakov, 69, tried to conceal Deripaska's involvement through various ways including shell companies and forged signatures.

McGonigal and Shestakov are charged with violating and conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, conspiring to commit money laundering and money laundering.

Shestakov is also charged with making material misstatements to the FBI.

McGonigal and Shestakov are both being held in a Brooklyn jail.

McGonigal joined the FBI in 1996 and began working on Russian foreign counterintelligence and organised crime.

During his time working in New York, he investigated the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and the September 11 terror attacks in 2001.

Last September, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Deripaska and three associates with conspiring to violate US sanctions by plotting to ensure his child was born in the US.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123214800/http://news.sky.com/story/charles-mcgonigal-ex-fbi-official-who-oversaw-oligarch-investigations-charged-over-helping-sanctioned-russian-billionaire-12793802

Epstein was found dead in his cell at a Manhattan jail in August 2019 as he waited trial on sex trafficking charges.

His death was ruled a suicide, but Maxwell, who had a relationship with him, said she does not believe that.

In an interview for Talk TV's Jeremy Kyle Live: Ghislaine Behind Bars, she said: ""I believe that he was murdered. I was shocked.

""Then I wondered how it had happened because as far as I was concerned, he was going to... I was sure he was going to appeal. And I was sure he was covered under the non-prosecution agreement.

The convicted sex offender also believes the infamous photograph of the Duke of York next to Virginia Giuffre is fake.

Allegedly taken inside Maxwell's Mayfair home, the photograph shows Prince Andrew with his arm around Ms Giuffre, who claims he had sex with her while she was underage.

Andrew has questioned the validity of the image and claimed to have never met Ms Giuffre, who was Virginia Roberts at the time.

Maxwell said: ""Well, it's a fake. I don't believe it's real. In fact, I'm sure it's not... There's never been an original. Further, there's no photograph; I've only ever seen a photocopy of it.

""I don't believe it happened, certainly the way as described. It would have been impossible. I don't have any memory of going to [the private nightclub] Tramp [where Ms Giuffre said Andrew danced with her].

The duke paid millions to settle a civil sexual assault case to Ms Giuffre after previously saying he has ""no recollection"" of meeting her and he is ""not one to hug"" or ""display affection"" in public.

Six Nations rugby: Coaches and players split over new rules on height of tackles ahead of international competitions

The Six Nations kicks off on 4 February

Questions about the effectiveness of asking rugby union players to lower the height of tackles hung over the launch of the Six Nations in central London on Monday.

It means the new year - which features an autumn world cup - has opened with renewed concerns about the dangers of playing the sport.

With governing bodies facing accusations of negligence in new lawsuits from former players, questions are being raised about whether action being taken is enough to prevent long-term brain damage and neurological conditions.

But doubts have also been raised about the usefulness of ordering players to keep tackles lower - as will happen across community rugby in England next season.

The question is: will the new rules reduce the number of concussions?

Coaches and players were split on the issue ahead of the Six Nations, which kicks off a week on Saturday.

Ireland captain Johnny Sexton is not convinced his country should adopt England's new regulations.

""You can get a knee in the head, you can get a hip in the head,"" he said.

""I'm not sure who puts these rules in place, but I don't agree with them, definitely. Especially for a taller man like myself who likes to tackle high.""

The priority, for Sexton, should be eradicating reckless tackles.

More than 60,000 people have signed a petition trying to overturn the RFU's ban - claiming it will lead to a rise in head-on-knee contact.

Players will have to be coached on lowering tackle height - with fears about the impact of collisions with knees.

Get that wrong and ""tackles can become just as dangerous"", according to Ireland coach Andy Farrell.

But the splits in the game were reflected by Farrell's son, England captain Owen, who can see the value in changes to address player welfare.

""The game is trying to become a safer game, which is good,"" he said.

""I think we, as England, are going to try to make sure we're on the right side of that and make sure we're pushing it in terms of trying to play the game hard, but safe and fair.""

Farrell would still be allowed to make above-waist tackles because the new rules won't apply in the Premiership or Championship.

But an extension of the changes more widely could be on the cards, with world rugby's governing body welcoming the RFU's decision to lower the height of tackles.

The subject is sure to dominate the build-up to the opening of the men's world cup in France in September.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123220813/https://news.sky.com/story/six-nations-rugby-coaches-and-players-split-over-new-rules-on-height-of-tackles-ahead-of-international-competitions-12793839

His death was ruled a suicide, but Maxwell, who had a relationship with him, said she does not believe that.

In an interview for Talk TV's Jeremy Kyle Live: Ghislaine Behind Bars, she said: ""I believe that he was murdered. I was shocked.

""Then I wondered how it had happened because as far as I was concerned, he was going to... I was sure he was going to appeal. And I was sure he was covered under the non-prosecution agreement.

""But I wasn't in the indictment. I wasn't mentioned. I wasn't even one of the co-conspirators.

""I honestly wish I had never met him.

""Looking back now, I probably wish I had stayed in England. But leaving that aside, you know, I tried to leave and start another new job and move on from the end of '98, '99.

""So I wish I had been more successful in moving on... Because I'd been a banker and so I should have moved on completely.""

Maxwell, daughter of the late media tycoon and MP Robert Maxwell, said she ""didn't know"" Epstein ""was so awful"", though he is ""obviously now, looking back with hindsight, of course"".

""But at the time, I mean he had lots of friends. He was friendly with just about everybody you could imagine,"" she said, speaking from prison.

""There was no reason to imagine that he was someone of interest to people.""

The convicted sex offender also believes the infamous photograph of the Duke of York next to Virginia Giuffre is fake.

Allegedly taken inside Maxwell's Mayfair home, the photograph shows Prince Andrew with his arm around Ms Giuffre, who claims he had sex with her while she was underage.

Andrew has questioned the validity of the image and claimed to have never met Ms Giuffre, who was Virginia Roberts at the time.

Maxwell said: ""Well, it's a fake. I don't believe it's real. In fact, I'm sure it's not... There's never been an original. Further, there's no photograph; I've only ever seen a photocopy of it.

""I don't believe it happened, certainly the way as described. It would have been impossible. I don't have any memory of going to [the private nightclub] Tramp [where Ms Giuffre said Andrew danced with her].

""Certainly it's not an outfit I would have worn.""

The duke paid millions to settle a civil sexual assault case to Ms Giuffre after previously saying he has ""no recollection"" of meeting her and he is ""not one to hug"" or ""display affection"" in public.

He claimed in 2019 it is not possible to prove if the image has been faked.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123220813/https://news.sky.com/story/ghislaine-maxwell-believes-jeffrey-epstein-was-murdered-and-wishes-she-never-met-him-12793892

Dylan Gartenmayer, 22, had not been seen for several hours after being swept along under the Florida waves by a strong current and resurfacing around a mile away.

Video shot on a boat packed with his family and friends, shows them spotting Mr Gartenmayer in the water, with one person exclaiming ""there he is!"", while a second shouts ""Dylan"", before others start screaming and jumping up and down with joy.

A second clip, also filmed by his cousin Priscilla Gartenmayer, shows people stretching out their arms to try to catch him as he is taken along at speed by the waves.

And then seconds later he is able to make his way to the back of the boat, and to safety, where he is hugged.

Image: Mr Gartenmayer was spotted in the water

The videos have now gone viral with millions of views on TikTok.

Before he went missing, two of his friends had been keeping watch on a boat at the original site where he dived, which was by a reef, several miles from the Florida Keys.

Below the surface, Mr Gartenmayer was freediving at a depth of about 35ft, when the current pushed him down to 150ft.

He said he was underwater for almost two minutes, as he held his breath.

""So that's how I ended up getting separated,"" he said. ""They were mainly looking down, thinking I blacked out from a lack of oxygen.""

'Scariest boat ride of our life'

The alarm was raised and his family then went out on his grandfather's boat looking for him - described as ""the scariest ride of our life"" - and were assisted in their search by the coastguard.

Mr Gartenmayer told the US news channel NBC6 that after he resurfaced he swam just over a mile to a channel marker, while clutching bamboo which he found in the water.

Image: His loved ones put out their arms to try to catch him

His mother, Tabitha, said that during the family's search, her son's friend Joel spotted an unusual sight on the water - buoys that seemed to be tied together.

Mr Gartenmayer had cut and bound together mooring balls to make a makeshift raft. He said he ""ended up cutting three of those from reef, tying up a little hammock"".

Shortly after seeing the buoys, he was spotted.

""I could hear a boat humming up behind me,"" said the 22-year-old. The vessel he heard heading towards him was packed with his family members.

Once on board he was transferred on to a coastguard boat and taken ashore. His body temperature was low at first but once it stabilised he was then released just an hour later.

'The smartest, most experienced diver I know'

His cousin, Priscilla Gartenmayer, recounted what happened on Facebook.

She wrote: ""After calling the fam together we hopped on the contender and had the scariest boat ride of our life out to his last-known coordinates.

""God was definitely on our side because as soon as we stopped running out and started looking, we spotted him right away at almost the exact coordinates we were given.""

He added: ""That second video was the moment we all laid eyes on him, I can't stop watching it.

The government has begun restoring power and launched an inquiry into the outage, which began around 7am local time.

Officials said it started when electricity was turned off during low usage hours overnight to conserve fuel across the country, leaving technicians unable to reboot the system all at once after daybreak.

Image: The mausoleum of Mohammad Ali Jinnah in Karachi during the power breakdown

Many major cities, including the capital Islamabad, and remote towns and villages across Pakistan were left without power for more than 12 hours.

As the electricity blackout continued late into Monday, the authorities sent police to markets across the country to provide security.

Officials later said power had been restored in many cities, 15 hours after the outage was reported.

It had left millions without drinking water, as pumps powered by electricity failed to work, and left schools, hospitals, factories and shops without power amid harsh winter weather.

Khurram Dastgir, the energy minister, told local reporters that engineers were working to restore power and tried to reassure the nation power would be restored within the next 12 hours.

He said electricity usage typically goes down overnight during winter, unlike in the summer months when Pakistanis turn to air conditioning.

""As an economic measure, we temporarily shut down our power generation systems"" on Sunday night, Mr Dastgir said.

He said when engineers tried to turn the system back on a ""fluctuation in voltage ... forced engineers to shut down the power grid"" stations one by one.

Mr Dastgir insisted the outage was not a major crisis and said backup generators kicked in to help key businesses and institutions such as hospitals, military and government facilities.

""We are hoping that the supply of electricity will be fully restored tonight,"" he said.

It was the second major electricity grid failure in three months, on top of the blackouts the country's nearly 220 million people experience almost daily.

Ageing electricity network desperately needs upgrade

Analysts and officials have blamed Pakistan's power problems on its ageing electricity network, which desperately needs an upgrade the government says it cannot afford.

The International Monetary Fund has bailed out Pakistan five times in the past two decades, but the latest funding is on pause due to differences with the government over a programme review that should have been completed in November.

While Pakistan has enough installed power capacity to meet demand, it lacks resources to run its oil-and-gas-powered plants.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230123230238/http://news.sky.com/story/pakistan-left-without-power-after-energy-saving-move-backfires-12793856

Tyre Nichols, 29, died in hospital three days after a confrontation during a traffic stop in Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

The father of one had been arrested after being stopped for reckless driving, police said.

Five black officers involved in the arrest have been sacked after a police investigation found they used excessive force or failed to intervene and help him.

Relatives have accused police of attacking Mr Nichols and causing him to have a heart attack. But authorities have only said he had a medical emergency.

A lawyer for Mr Nichols' family, Antonio Romanucci, said the beating lasted three minutes and ""he was a human pinata for those police officers"".

Another lawyer, Ben Crump, said the bodycam footage of the incident reminded the family and lawyers of the infamous video of the Los Angeles police beating of Rodney King, a clip the prompted riots in the city in 1991.

He said the footage of the latest encounter shows it was ""violent"" and ""troublesome on every level"", and added it was ""appalling"", ""deplorable"" and ""heinous"".

Mr Crump said the video will be released to the public but not for a week or two.

Investigators do not want to show it yet because they do not want to risk compromising the investigation, according to Shelby County district attorney Steve Mulroy.

There is concern among city and community leaders that the footage could cause civil unrest when it is eventually released.

Mr Nichols' stepfather, Rodney Wells, said the family hopes that any protests stay peaceful.

Van Turner, president of the Memphis chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, a civil rights organisation, also said the city seems tense as it waits for the video.

He praised the city and the police department for taking ""quick action"" in firing the officers, identified as Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills Jr and Justin Smith.

One of 10 people wounded in the atrocity in Monterey Park, about seven miles (11 km) east of Downtown Los Angeles, has now died of their injuries, health officials said.

Two women, My Nhan, 65, and Lilian Li, 63, have been named as being among the dead.

Sky News understands that Ming Wei Ma, owner of the Star Ballroom Dance Studio, also died.

All but one of the victims was 60 or older, according to the Los Angeles coroner's office.

About 20 minutes after the shooting, the 72-year-old suspect, Huu Can Tran, entered the Lai Lai Ballroom and Studio dance club in the neighbouring city of Alhambra.

Brandon Tsay, who operates the family-run venue, described how he managed to wrestle the weapon from him before he was able to start shooting.

""That moment, it was primal instinct,"" Mr Tsay told The New York Times, adding that the gunman fled the scene after a 90-second struggle.

""Something happened there. I don't know what came over me.""

Mr Tsay told ABC: ""When I got the courage, I lunged at him with both my hands, grabbed the weapon and we had a struggle.

""We struggled into the lobby, trying to get this gun away from each other. He was hitting me across the face, bashing the back of my head.""

After finally getting control of the gun, Mr Tsay said he pointed it at Tran and shouted: ""Get the hell out of here! I'll shoot! Get away! Go!""

About 12 hours later, police officers in Torrance, 20 miles southwest of Monterey Park, cornered a white van Tran was driving.

As officers approached, they heard a single gun shot from inside as Tran killed himself.

His mobile home in a community for pensioners has been searched.

Law enforcement forces said evidence gathered so far indicated a personal motive rather than terrorism or a hate crime, NBC reported.

It has emerged that Tran visited police in his town of Hemet twice this month to allege he was the victim of fraud, theft and poisoning by family members between 10 and 20 years ago in the LA area, spokesman Alan Reyes said.

Tran said he would return to the station with documentation but never did.

Elon Musk took over the company in a $44bn (£35bn) deal last year, and subsequently began cutting thousands of jobs.

The split, which occurred near the UK's Halley research station, was recorded between 7pm and 8pm yesterday.

The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) relocated the station 23km inland of what they called Chasm One in 2016 after it began to widen.

It said the calving happened a decade after scientists first detected the growth of vast cracks in the ice.

The new iceberg is estimated to be around 1,550 sq km in area and around 150 metres thick.

Image: Pics: Sebastian Gleich/BAS

BAS glaciologists said the calving was not linked to climate change and is part of the natural behaviour of the ice shelf.

They said the area of the ice shelf where the research station is located was unaffected by the split.

Since 2017, staff have been deployed to the station in a limited capacity, only during the Antarctic summer, which runs between November and march.

There are currently 21 staff on the station working to maintain the power supplies and facilities in order to keep scientific experiments operating remotely through the winter.

They will continue to work until they are picked up early next month.

Professor Dame Jane Francis, the director of BAS, said: ""Our glaciologists and operations teams have been anticipating this event.

""Measurements of the ice shelf are carried out multiple times a day using an automated network of high-precision GPS instruments that surround the station.

""These measure how the ice shelf is deforming and moving, and are compared to satellite images from ESA, NASA and the German satellite TerraSAR-X. All data are sent back to Cambridge for analysis, so we know what is happening even in the Antarctic winter - when there are no staff on the station, it is dark for 24 hours and the temperature falls below minus 50C (or -58F).""

Professor Dominic Hodgson, a BAS glaciologist, added: ""This calving event has been expected and is part of the natural behaviour of the Brunt Ice Shelf.

""It is not linked to climate change. Our science and operational teams continue to monitor the ice shelf in real-time to ensure it is safe, and to maintain the delivery of the science we undertake at Halley.""

A statement shared by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office thanked various organisations as search operations entered their 11th day.

Sands was first reported missing on 13 January in the Baldy Bowl area of the San Gabriel mountains in southern California.

In the statement, his family said they were ""deeply touched"" by the support they had received.

""Our heartfelt thanks to the compassionate members of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department who are coordinating the search for our beloved Julian, not least the heroic search teams listed below who are braving difficult conditions on the ground and in the air to bring Julian home.

""We are deeply touched by the outpouring of love and support.""

Local and out-of-county forces - as well as specialised canine and cave teams - are involved in the search.

In a message sharing the statement, the sheriff's department added: ""As we enter day 11 of the search for Julian Sands on Mt. Baldy, we are reminded of the sheer determination and selflessness of all of the people who have aided in this search.

""We will continue to utilise the resources available to us.""

On Monday, a spokesperson for the sheriff's department said conditions were still too dangerous for ground crews to operate, and that searches would be conducted by helicopter.

It was previously revealed that pings from Sands' phone appeared to show he had been on the move heading further into the mountainous area of Baldy Bowl on the day he was reported missing.

Sands was born in Yorkshire and moved to Los Angeles in 2020.

His breakout role came as the free-spirited George in the period drama A Room With A View, in which he starred opposite Helena Bonham Carter.

He later made the move to the horror genre - featuring in films such as Leaving Las Vegas, Warlock and Arachnophobia.

A damning report found a catalogue of errors in the Probation Service's handling of Jordan McSweeney, which meant he was not treated as a high-risk offender and was ""free"" to commit this ""most heinous crime"".

Last month, the 29-year-old was sentenced to a minimum of 38 years for sexually assaulting and murdering the 35-year-old aspiring lawyer in Ilford, east London, on 26 June last year.

Image: Jordan McSweeney

Justice Secretary Dominic Raab ordered a review of how probation staff had supervised McSweeney when it emerged he had been freed from prison on licence - where individuals are released from jail but still have a part of their sentence to serve in the community - nine days before the murder.

In the report, Chief Inspector of Probation Justin Russell said: ""Jordan McSweeney should have been considered a high risk of serious harm offender. If he had, more urgent action would have been taken to recall him to prison, after he missed his supervision appointments on release from custody.

""The Probation Service failed to do so, and he was free to commit this most heinous crime on an innocent, young woman.""

In the nine days before the murder, McSweeney's licence had been revoked after he failed to attend any meetings with probation officers, but he had not been recalled to prison.

Mr Russell said McSweeney was considered a ""violent"" man and ""all the evidence"" shows on release from prison he should have been classed as a ""high risk of serious harm"".

But he was wrongly assessed as a ""medium"" risk because ""each of the offences, his behaviours in prison and his criminal history had been reviewed in isolation"".

Mr Russell said staff involved in the assessment had ""unmanageable workloads made worse by high staff vacancy rates"", as he highlighted the problem which the watchdog has ""increasingly seen"" in inspections of services.

McSweeney's abduction, sexual assault and murder of Ms Aleena lasted nine minutes. She suffered 46 separate injuries and was ""stamped and strangled to death"".

McSweeney had 28 previous convictions for 69 separate offences dating back 17 years and had a history of violence towards ex-partners.

A change in wind direction means it is pretty mild in Scotland, and temperatures could reach 12C or 13C (53.6F to 55.4F) in Aberdeenshire later today.

Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said: ""Further south across the rest of England and Wales we're still under the colder conditions, so there could be some fog again which will be quite slow to clear, so a very similar start to Monday.

The 64-year-old actor is facing an involuntary manslaughter charge following the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the film's set in October 2021.

Her husband Matt will also remain executive producer - and Joel Souza, who was injured in the incident, is returning as director.

Hutchins died on the set outside Sante Fe, New Mexico, when a revolver Baldwin was rehearsing with fired with a live bullet.

Baldwin has denied responsibility for the shooting - saying live ammunition should never have been allowed on set and weapons handlers were responsible for firearm safety.

The film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, has also been charged with involuntary manslaughter.

Legal analysts have suggested that prosecutors may face an uphill battle in efforts to convict Baldwin of criminal charges without proof he knew live ammunition was present.

An investigation by Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office has yet to reveal how live rounds got onto the film set in the first place.

Melina Spadone, the attorney for Rust Movie Productions, told Sky News that the film is still on track to be completed.

The man was found dead near Balmore Golf Club, in East Dunbartonshire, on 16 October 2011.

It is thought he could have been dead for up to six months before he was discovered.

But now, investigators at the Scottish Cold Case Unit at Glasgow Caledonian University have released a new facial reconstruction and 3D images of the man's clothing in a fresh bid to solve the 11-year puzzle.

There were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the man's death, who detectives have estimated as between 25 and 34 years old.

However, forensic analysis has revealed he suffered injuries before his death which may have affected his appearance, quality of life and gait.

Dr Maureen Taylor, co-director of the cold case unit, said: ""We know he had a chip to one of his front teeth and injuries to his nose and jaw that he sustained in the months leading to his death.

""These injuries were not only left untreated, but would have caused him significant pain.

""We also believe that he may have walked with a limp or had difficulty walking.""

Investigators said the white European man was between 5ft 8in and 6ft 1in tall and of slight build, with light-coloured hair.

He was discovered wearing a blue Topman T-shirt with a maroon diagonal stripe on the front, a blue zipped cardigan bearing the logo Greek Pennsylvania, light-coloured jeans and black waterproof walking shoes, commonly bought in Lidl.

In a nearby Nike messenger-type bag, investigators found items including toiletries, clothes, headphones, chargers, a lighter and cigarette papers.

The images were produced by the University of Dundee and are being shown online alongside photos of the man's belongings and drone footage of the woodland, close to Golf Course Road, where his body was found.

317;Archbishops call for 'radical redesign' of England's 'broken' care system;Tuesday 24 January 2023 02:36, UK;['shamaan freeman-powell', '@shamaan_skynews'];['social care'];['funding', 'archbishops', 'system', 'radical', 'support', 'national', 'broken', 'redesign', 'unpaid', 'englands', 'things', 'report', 'care', 'health', 'social'];"Archbishops have called for a ""radical redesign"" of England's ""broken"" social care system.

A so-called National Care Covenant, setting out the rights and responsibilities of national and local government, communities, families and citizens should be established, the Archbishops' Commission on Reimagining Care said.

Published today, it also calls on the government to ""set out a long-term commitment to introduce a universal entitlement to care and support"" which should be on a par with the NHS.

Can the NHS survive? Be in the audience for live debate

The report took 18 months to compile, and it included input from people including unpaid carers, experts and care workers.

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said such a covenant would be a ""step towards"" a position where ""everyone is engaged in a collaborative effort to ensure that we can all access the care and support we need"".

The report said: ""This will require a means of collective funding and pooling of risk, probably with a tariff of care charges established on a national basis.""

In November, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced that social care reforms due to come into effect in October this year would be delayed by two years until 2025.

They include an £86,000 cap on personal care cost contributions, and an expanded means test that is more generous than the existing one.

In their report, the archbishops insisted ""piecemeal tinkering with the existing system will not produce the desired result"".

They called for ""a radical redesign of the system to make it simple, consistent and person-centred"".

They acknowledged their recommendations will come at a cost, stating that it ""cannot be the work of government alone, nor will it be achieved in one parliament"".

Stating that ""social care is everybody's business"", the commission said people should be willing to contribute funding through taxes ""so that everyone, regardless of income and wealth, can get care and support"".

The commission has also called for a new deal for unpaid carers, ensuring they are better valued and supported, with adequate recognition, rest and recompense, as well as more investment in communities.

Census data for England and Wales revealed that five million people currently provide unpaid care to people with long-term health conditions or problems related to age.

Katharine Macy is among the five million.

She became a carer for her mum when she was just 10 - helping to cook, clean and organise the household finances.

""It was quite natural to go to school, come home, do things at home then do things like homework - or my own 'fun' things,"" she said.

Katherine said her role as a carer has always been ""at the centre of many things"" in her life, which made deciding to study a PHD full time difficult - as it would mean her 80-year-old grandmother picking up the slack.

She is glad she made the decision, and grateful for the support of her family, but said she still deals with ""a lot of guilt and a lot of tears because you would do anything for the people you love"".

Mr Welby said: ""This report gives me hope that we can rise to the challenge of fixing our broken social care system.""

Commission chairwoman Dr Anna Dixon said: ""This is no time for tinkering around the edges of a social care system that for too long has left people who draw on care and support feeling marginalised, carers feeling exhausted and undervalued, a system which provides no clarity about what is expected of each of us.

""A National Care Covenant, with its focus on the mutual responsibilities, will help us to work together towards our common goal.""

A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""We are committed to working with a range of stakeholders on how best to improve adult social care and we have made up to £7.5bn available over the next two years to support services - the biggest funding increase in history.""

German national Frank Hanebuth appeared in court alongside 49 alleged collaborators from numerous countries, at least 34 of whom agreed to a plea deal allowing them to pay fines instead of serving time.

Hanebuth did not seek a deal.

Some of the defendants were of German, Greek or British origin and needed an interpreter to follow the developments, which were conducted in Spanish.

Three of the accused took part via video link from Germany.

Spanish prosecutors have charged Hanebuth with membership in a criminal organisation, money laundering and illegal possession of firearms.

They are also asking the judge overseeing the trial to fine him €4.2m (£3.7m) for the money laundering charge.

In addition to belonging to a criminal organisation, other defendants have been charged with running a prostitution ring and drug trafficking, and face up to 38 years in prison.

The Hells Angels conducted illegal activities in Mallorca from 2009 to 2013 under Hanebuth's leadership, according to the criminal indictment.

Hanebuth appointed members who then carried out crimes including extortion, prostitution, acquiring illegal firearms and robbery in popular tourist spots, prosecutors said.

They also moved into real estate on Mallorca and nearby island Ibiza, prosecutors said.

The Hells Angels in Europe are believed to have chosen Mallorca because of a large number of foreign residents and other money laundering and drug trafficking schemes.

The Mallorca chapter of the gang was strongly international, with recruits from as far away as the Dominican Republic and Morocco, according to the indictment.

One of the defendants who took a plea deal was Paul Witworth, a British associate of Hanebuth's who prosecutors say maintained links with the Adams family, a notorious UK gang also known as The Clerkenwell Crime Syndicate.

Hanebuth also kept up with his German base in Hanover, prosecutors said.

Police have said Ruben Dario da Silva Villar provided the ammunition to target the pair, made phone calls to the confessed killer before and after the crime, and paid his lawyer.

Fisherman Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira, nicknamed Pelado, admitted that he shot Mr Phillips and Mr Pereira, and has been under arrest since soon after the killings in early June.

He and three other relatives are accused of being involved in the crime.

They all live in a poor community inside a federal agrarian reform settlement between the city of Atalaia do Norte and Javari Valley Indigenous Territory.

Mr Villar has denied any wrongdoing in the case.

Before Monday's announcement, he was already being held on charges of using false Brazilian and Peruvian documents and leading an illegal fishing scheme.

According to the investigation, he financed local fishermen to fish inside Javari Valley Indigenous Territory.

In a statement, UNIVAJA, the local indigenous association that employed Mr Pereira, said it believed there were other significant plotters behind the killings who have not been arrested.

A statement shared by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office thanked various organisations as search operations entered their 11th day.

Sands was first reported missing on 13 January in the Baldy Bowl area of the San Gabriel mountains in southern California.

In the statement, his family said they were ""deeply touched"" by the support they had received.

""Our heartfelt thanks to the compassionate members of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department who are coordinating the search for our beloved Julian, not least the heroic search teams listed below who are braving difficult conditions on the ground and in the air to bring Julian home.

""We are deeply touched by the outpouring of love and support.""

Local and out-of-county forces - as well as specialised canine and cave teams - are involved in the search.

In a message sharing the statement, the sheriff's department added: ""As we enter day 11 of the search for Julian Sands on Mt. Baldy, we are reminded of the sheer determination and selflessness of all of the people who have aided in this search.

""We will continue to utilise the resources available to us.""

On Monday, a spokesperson for the sheriff's department said conditions were still too dangerous for ground crews to operate, and that searches would be conducted by helicopter.

It was previously revealed that pings from Sands' phone appeared to show he had been on the move heading further into the mountainous area of Baldy Bowl on the day he was reported missing.

Sands was born in Yorkshire and moved to Los Angeles in 2020.

His breakout role came as the free-spirited George in the period drama A Room With A View, in which he starred opposite Helena Bonham Carter.

He later made the move to the horror genre - featuring in films such as Leaving Las Vegas, Warlock and Arachnophobia.

More recently he played the chief medical officer in the 2021 Jack Lowden and Peter Capaldi-led drama Benediction.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124050219/http://news.sky.com/story/julian-sands-11-days-after-he-went-missing-british-actors-family-thank-search-team-for-heroic-efforts-12793958

The government's energy support scheme has led to the highest-ever government monthly borrowing figures for December since records began in 1993.

The UK government borrowed £27.4bn last month, the Office for National Statistics recorded.

This is £16.6bn higher than the same period the year before.

Public sector borrowing for the year to December 2022 was £128.1bn. This was up £5.1bn compared to the year before, but £2.7bn less than the Office for Budgetary Responsibility forecasted.

The government's energy support scheme was announced under Liz Truss, and was continued by Rishi Sunak.

The ONS says the increase in borrowing was largely due to ""a sharp rise in spending on energy support schemes and an increase in debt interest"".

Reacting to today's figures, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: ""Right now we are helping millions of families with the cost of living, but we must also ensure that our level of debt is fair for future generations.

""We have already taken some tough decisions to get debt falling, and it is vital that we stick to this plan so we can halve inflation this year and get growth going again - creating better-paid jobs across the country.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124071740/http://news.sky.com/story/politics-news-latest-hes-toast-pressure-builds-on-nadhim-zahawi-to-resign-over-tax-affairs-12593360

Meanwhile, a suspect is in custody after seven people were killed in two related shootings at a mushroom farm and a trucking firm in a coastal community south of San Francisco.

Officials said four people were killed at the farm and three at the trucking business on the outskirts of Half Moon Bay, a city about 30 miles south of San Francisco.

The police have arrested 67-year-old Zhao Chunli in connection with the shooting.

Battles across Ukraine are largely in deadlock as soldiers continue to fight through freezing conditions.

But with both Russia and Ukraine planning new offensives in the coming months, it is thought spring will be decisive.

""If the major Russian offensive planned for this time fails, it will be the ruin of Russia and Putin,"" Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraine's military intelligence, said in an interview with news site Delfi.



One of the decisive factors in the upcoming battles could be the supply of new Western weapons.

Ukraine has been calling for modern tanks - and it has been provided with Challenger 2 tanks by the UK.

But it has been waiting on Berlin to allow German-made Leopard 2 tanks to be sent from Poland.

The man was found dead near Balmore Golf Club, in East Dunbartonshire, on 16 October 2011.

It is thought he could have been dead for up to six months before he was discovered.

But now, investigators at the Scottish Cold Case Unit at Glasgow Caledonian University have released a new facial reconstruction and 3D images of the man's clothing in a fresh bid to solve the 11-year puzzle.

There were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the man's death, who detectives have estimated as between 25 and 34 years old.

However, forensic analysis has revealed he suffered injuries before his death which may have affected his appearance, quality of life and gait.

Dr Maureen Taylor, co-director of the cold case unit, said: ""We know he had a chip to one of his front teeth and injuries to his nose and jaw that he sustained in the months leading to his death.

""These injuries were not only left untreated, but would have caused him significant pain.

""We also believe that he may have walked with a limp or had difficulty walking.""

Investigators said the white European man was between 5ft 8in and 6ft 1in tall and of slight build, with light-coloured hair.

He was discovered wearing a blue Topman T-shirt with a maroon diagonal stripe on the front, a blue zipped cardigan bearing the logo Greek Pennsylvania, light-coloured jeans and black waterproof walking shoes, commonly bought in Lidl.

In a nearby Nike messenger-type bag, investigators found items including toiletries, clothes, headphones, chargers, a lighter and cigarette papers.

The images were produced by the University of Dundee and are being shown online alongside photos of the man's belongings and drone footage of the woodland, close to Golf Course Road, where his body was found.

Andrea Bonafede was arrested by Carabinieri police on a warrant issued by judicial authorities in Palermo, the capital of Sicily.

When Messina Denaro was captured last week at a Palermo clinic where he was receiving chemotherapy, he was using an official identity card with Bonafede's name but with his own photo.

Bonafede is suspected of being a member of Cosa Nostra, as the Sicilian Mafia is known, and helping Messina Denaro to carry out his role as a major mob boss.

Accusations in the warrant said that with Bonafede's identity, the 60-year-old fugitive was ""able to move on the territory [of Italy], eluding law enforcement, as well as access national healthcare without revealing his real identity"".

Investigators suspected that Bonafede also received €20,000 (£17,500) from the mafia boss in order to buy a house in western Sicily that served as one of Messina Denaro's hideouts.

Police have searched at least three homes in the town of Campobello di Mazara, western Sicily, near Trapani, which they say were used over the last several months.

During the searches authorities found airline ticket receipts, receipts from expensive restaurants, jewellery and posters from films including The Godfather and Joker.

A black Alfa Romeo Giulietta car, which Messina Denaro used to drive himself around, was also found with Bonafede's identification documents, the arrest warrant said.

Messina Denaro had been on the run since 1993 and was sentenced in absentia to a life term for murders he carried out in the early 1990s.

Associated British Foods (ABF) reported a 15% rise in retail sales over the 16 weeks to 7 January.

In the UK, Primark said much of its 15% lift on the same period last year was achieved on a like-for-like basis, meaning the growth could not be credited to new Primark store openings.

The company pointed to record demand in the run-up to Christmas, with its sales on the continent and elsewhere also rising on the back of its value offering.

The prospect of a discounted shopping experience has proved attractive to consumers across much of the western world given the pressures placed on the purse strings from energy-led inflation.

The cost of living crisis has been the main threat to retailers - especially those in the non-essential spending sphere.

Official retail sales figures for the UK, released last week, showed a surprise drop during the key month of December despite a largely upbeat set of trading updates from listed retailers since the festive season finished.

ABF, which also owns major sugar, grocery, agriculture and ingredients businesses, said its total revenue rose 16% on a constant currency basis.

Despite the upbeat performance, the company said its outlook for the full year was unchanged.

It is expecting adjusted operating profit to be down on the 2021-22 figure of £1.4bn.

The group said it continued to encounter significant cost pressures but inflation had become less volatile and some commodity costs had declined more recently.

It said of the performance at Primark: ""To date, Primark trading has been good in all our markets and was ahead of expectation.

Brandon Tsay, 26, has been hailed as a hero for disarming Huu Can Tran at the Lai Lai Ballroom in Alhambra.

In the footage, Mr Tsay can be seen confronting the gunman in what appears to be an empty lobby in the dance hall.

An armed man, dressed in dark clothing and a hat, walks out of the picture and about 30 seconds later is seen struggling with Mr Tsay.

He manages to take the gun away from the attacker who then punches him in the head.

The men continue to struggle before Mr Tsay pushes Tran off him - leaving the assailant with no option but to escape.

Tyre Nichols, 29, died in hospital three days after a confrontation during a traffic stop in the US city of Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

The father of one had been arrested after being stopped for reckless driving, police said.

Five black officers involved in the arrest have been sacked after a police investigation found they used excessive force or failed to intervene and help him.

Relatives have accused police of attacking Mr Nichols and causing him to have a heart attack. But authorities have only said he had a medical emergency.

A lawyer for Mr Nichols' family, Antonio Romanucci, said the beating lasted three minutes and ""he was a human pinata for those police officers"".

Another lawyer, Ben Crump, said the bodycam footage of the incident reminded the family and lawyers of the 1991 video of Rodney King being beaten by police in Los Angeles, where a year later officers were acquitted by a jury, leading to riots in the city.

He said the footage of the latest encounter shows it was ""violent"" and ""troublesome on every level"", and added it was ""appalling"", ""deplorable"" and ""heinous"".

Mr Crump said the video will be released to the public but not for a week or two.

Investigators do not want to show it yet because they do not want to risk compromising the investigation, according to Shelby County district attorney Steve Mulroy.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported a total of £27.4bn - a leap of almost £17bn on the same month a year ago.

It blamed £7bn in costs from energy support schemes.

Added to that was interest payments on debt, reaching £17.3bn.

The ONS said that sum was the second largest in any single month behind the £20bn recorded in June 2022.

It added that £13.7bn within the figure reflected the impact of inflation, as many government bonds are linked to the Retail Prices Index measure.

The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast that the government's debt interest bill alone will come in at almost £116bn in the financial year to March.

December's figure took the total to date to £87.8bn.

The overall net borrowing figure was around £10bn higher than many economists had forecast.

It could be used by ministers to bolster their tough stance over public sector pay increases as strikes continue to cripple many services.

The government has argued that settlements must be affordable as unions representing the likes of nurses, ambulance staff and firefighters continue to demand hikes that will better shield their members from the cost of living crisis.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said in reaction to the borrowing figures: ""Right now we are helping millions of families with the cost of living, but we must also ensure that our level of debt is fair for future generations.

Analysis by Megan Baynes, cost of living reporter

The promise of up to £100 off your energy bill seems like a great deal, all for the price of turning off your lights for a few short hours.

But can sitting in the dark really save you £100?

Households are being promised savings if they cut back their electricity use during certain peak hours - with the first real run of the Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) taking place last night and today.

It seems like a no-brainer amid an energy crisis that has left millions struggling with their monthly payments.

I'm with Octopus Energy and opted into their Saving Sessions as soon as they became available on the app. The energy provider has run five since November.

Of these, I opted into four (I forgot to click to opt into one on the 30 November) and diligently turned off the electricity as much as possible during the set time periods.

Washing machine? Off. Lights? Off. TV? Off. Heating? Off.

I even timed to be out during one of them, to guarantee I wasn't using any electricity.

My savings so far? £2.36.

So, is it worth it?

I only live with one other person - unless you count the two cats - which means our energy usage is already relatively low, and we struggled to cut back any further. This resulted in very minimal savings through the scheme.

We use the washing machine a few times a week (at most) and already did it during the day, and my irregular work hours mean I often cook dinner later at night after peak time has already passed.

Like us, if you already have fairly low energy usage - or use it mainly out of peak demand - you may find you can't quite cut back to the percentage required to save money.

Indeed, during two of the sessions, we didn't save a single penny (including one time when we went weren't in the property).

I am also reluctant to turn off any of the constantly-on appliances in my home (the fridge and freezer) because if I'm only going to be saving a few pennies, is it worth the risk of all my food going rancid?

But it's never a bad idea to consider how much energy you use and try to cut back (whatever time of day) and you lose absolutely nothing from opting in.

In fact, despite my minimal savings, I would recommend anyone who can sign up for the scheme does so - every penny counts.

Households who were already using a lot of energy during peak hours (5pm to 9pm) will likely find they save more by shifting their schedules around by an hour. But for smaller households, or those with irregular hours, be aware that your rewards may be much lower than the promised £100.

Plus, the main reason behind these sessions isn't really money - it's reducing the UK's energy consumption in a bid to prevent blackouts.

So I'll continue to sign up for every session, and dutifully turn off most of the appliances in my home, at the very least to try and take some pressure off the National Grid.

And who knows - maybe this session will be the one where I save enough to make it worth it.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124091740/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-uk-borrowing-hit-record-december-level-with-three-reasons-offered-12615118

In 2022, more than 300 children in Gambia, Indonesia and Uzbekistan - who were mostly under the age of five - died of acute kidney injury, in deaths associated with contaminated medicines, the WHO said.

The over-the-counter medicines contained high levels of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol, the WHO warning added.

""These contaminants are toxic chemicals used as industrial solvents and antifreeze agents that can be fatal even taken in small amounts, and should never be found in medicines,"" the organisation said.

The Philippines, Timor Leste, Senegal and Cambodia also have the medicines on sale and could be impacted, Reuters reported.

The WHO called for action across its 194 member states to prevent more deaths.

""Since these are not isolated incidents, WHO calls on various key stakeholders engaged in the medical supply chain to take immediate and coordinated action,"" its experts said on Monday.

The WHO has already sent specific product alerts in October, November and January, requesting some ""substandard products"" are removed from circulation to ""prevent harm to patients"".

The alerts covered some cough syrups made by India's Maiden Pharmaceuticals and Marion Biotech, as well as similar medicines made by four Indonesian manufacturers - PT Yarindo Farmatama, PT Universal Pharmaceutical, PT Konimex and PT AFI Pharma - that were sold domestically.

The companies involved have either denied that their products have been contaminated or declined to comment while investigations are ongoing.

But the WHO reiterated its call for the products to be removed from circulation, as well as urging countries to ensure that any medicines for sale are approved by competent authorities.

It also asked governments and regulators to assign resources to inspect manufacturers, increase market surveillance and take action where required.

While manufacturers should only buy raw ingredients from qualified suppliers, test their products more thoroughly and keep records of the process, the WHO added.

The WHO also said suppliers and distributors should check for signs of falsification and only distribute or sell medicines authorised for use.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124101913/http://news.sky.com/story/cough-syrup-deaths-who-urges-immediate-action-after-300-child-deaths-last-year-12794065

Following a meeting between the NATO secretary-general and the German defence minister, still no decision has been made on whether Berlin will allow Leopard 2 tanks to be sent to Ukraine.

Over the weekend, Germany's foreign minister hinted Berlin would not stand in the way if Poland decided to send the German-made tanks - but she later appeared to backtrack on her comments.

NATO's Jens Stoltenberg said he and defence minister Boris Pistorius ""discussed the issue of battle tanks"" in their talks in Berlin today.

""These discussions will continue and I am confident we will have a solution soon,"" he said.

Mr Stoltenberg added he welcomes France, the UK and other allies pledging tanks for Ukraine ahead of likely renewed offensives from both sides this spring.

""At this pivotal moment in the war we must provide heavier and more advances systems to Ukraine and we must do it faster,"" he said.

Nine others were wounded in the massacre, with further deaths averted by the heroic actions of a worker who disarmed Tran when he entered a second dance hall in Los Angeles County, apparently wielding a gun.

The 72-year-old fatally shot himself after fleeing the scene as police closed in on his van.

He had once been a dance teacher at the same venue where he is accused of opening fire, it has emerged.

As police piece together what happened, those who knew him have shared other details about the alleged shooter.

Here is what we know so far about him.

Tran's links to the dance studio

Tran was reportedly a regular at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park, where he is said to have fired 42 rounds on Saturday night (21 January).

An ex-wife of Tran's told CNN she met him at the studio about 20 years ago, and that he used to give lessons there.

A long-time acquaintance of Tran's said he would go to the studio almost every night in the late 2000s and early 2010s.

They told CNN he was ""hostile to a lot of people there"" and that Tran had claimed the instructors at the time didn't like him and said ""evil things about him"".

It is unclear if Tran had been to the dance studio in recent times and if he knew anyone who was inside during the shooting.

Quick to anger but 'never violent' before

Tran's ex-wife told CNN Tran was never violent but he was quick to anger - for instance, if she missed a step while dancing.

A tenant of Tran's, Adam Hood, told Reuters Tran was an angry, aggressive person who did not have many friends but liked ballroom dancing, his main social activity.

""He was a good dancer,"" said Mr Hood, who met Tran in the early 2000s and said they bonded over their shared experience as Chinese immigrants.

""But he was distrustful of the people at the studio, angry and distrustful. I think he just had enough.""

Tran complained that people at the studio were talking behind his back, Mr Hood added.

Tran's personal life

The shooting suspect lived at a mobile home park for over-55s in Hemet, California, about 65 miles east of where the murders took place.

He used to live closer to the dance studio. Records show he lived in San Gabriel, near Monterey Park, from the early 1990s until around 2014.

Tran and his ex-wife divorced in 2005. He never remarried and did not have a girlfriend, according to Mr Hood.

Tran had an active trucking licence and used to own a company called Tran's Trucking that he started in 2002.

Interactions with police

Police in Monterey Park had no prior interactions with Tran, police chief Scott Wiese said at a news conference on Monday.

But Tran had visited Hemet police twice this month to report he was the victim of fraud, theft and poisoning by family members a decade or two ago in the LA area, Hemet police spokesperson Alan Reyes told The Associated Press.

Tran said he would return to the station with documentation but never did.

After the shootings, sheriff's deputies from Los Angeles County searched Tran's home and found a .308-calibre rifle, an unknown amount of bullets and evidence he was making homemade firearm suppressors that muffle the sound of the weapons.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124120238/http://news.sky.com/story/california-shooting-suspect-hostile-gunman-huu-can-tran-was-distrustful-former-dance-teacher-12794082

Farah Naz said it revealed ""a litany of errors"" in the lead up to her niece's death.

She told BBC Radio Four's Woman's Hour it's ""not a service that's doing its best with inadequate resources... This is a service that is incompetent and has the failures by people at the top to ensure a quality service.""

The report found failings by probation officers left sexual predator Jordan McSweeney able to stalk and kill Ms Aleena just days after he was released from prison.

The 29-year-old was sentenced to a minimum of 38 years for sexually assaulting and murdering the 35-year-old in Ilford, east London, on 26 June last year.

Justice Secretary Dominic Raab ordered a review of how probation staff had supervised McSweeney when it emerged he had been freed from prison on licence - where individuals are released from jail but still have a part of their sentence to serve in the community - nine days before the murder.

In the report, chief inspector of probation Justin Russell said: ""Jordan McSweeney should have been considered a high risk of serious harm offender. If he had, more urgent action would have been taken to recall him to prison, after he missed his supervision appointments on release from custody.

""The Probation Service failed to do so, and he was free to commit this most heinous crime on an innocent, young woman.""

In the nine days before the murder, McSweeney's licence had been revoked after he failed to attend any meetings with probation officers, but he had not been recalled to prison.

London's mayor Sadiq Khan said the probation failings are ""symptomatic of wider issues"" which ""must be addressed immediately"".

Mr Khan said: ""My thoughts are with Zara's family and loved ones on this extremely difficult day.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124120238/http://news.sky.com/story/zara-aleena-law-graduates-aunt-calls-probation-failings-around-her-killer-extremely-distressing-12794119

The undisturbed remains of the boy, estimated to be 14 or 15 years old when he died, were examined via CT scans, revealing the lengths his family went to in attempting to ensure his safe passage to the afterlife.

Ancient Egyptians believed that when people died, their spirit embarked on a dangerous journey into the underworld, where their character would be judged.

To ensure a positive outcome, a place in the afterlife, this particular teenager was buried with 49 amulets - including a golden scarab where his heart would have been and a golden tongue inside his mouth.

The mummy dates back to the Ptolemaic period, when Egypt was ruled by a dynasty of the same name.

He was found at a cemetery used between approximately 332 and 30 BC in Nag el-Hassay in southern Egypt during the First World War, but was left unexamined in the basement of Cairo's Egyptian Museum until now.

Thanks to the findings of the new study, published in the journal Frontiers in Medicine, the mummy was moved to the main exhibition hall under the nickname ""Golden boy"".

How was the boy buried?

Not only was the mummy decorated with 49 amulets, reflecting his high class status, he also wore a gilded mask, a pectoral cartonnage on his torso, and a pair of sandals.

""The sandals were probably meant to enable the boy to walk out of the coffin,"" said Dr Sahar Saleem, professor of medicine at Cairo University and lead author on the study.

""According to the ancient Egyptians' ritual Book of The Dead, the deceased had to wear white sandals to be pious and clean before reciting its verses.""

The mummy was placed inside two coffins - the inner one made of wood, while the outer bore a Greek inscription.

He was surrounded by ferns, as was an ancient Egyptian tradition.

Dr Saleem said: ""Ancient Egyptians were fascinated by plants and flowers and believed they possessed sacred and symbolic effects.""

As well as having his heart removed, the boy had his brain taken out through his nose.

His teeth were in good shape, though, with no evidence of disease or cavities.

The American singer and flutist is the latest star to be revealed, along with David Guetta, Becky Hill and Ella Henderson who will also take to the stage next month.

They will share the bill with Harry Styles, Cat Burns, Sam Smith & Kim Petras and Wet Leg, who have been previously announced.

There has already been controversy around the recently revealed nominations, with an all-male best artist of the year list leading many to question the newly introduced gender-neutral categories.

Defending the nomination choices, the awards said that while the lack of female nominees was ""disappointing"", it was down to 2022 seeing ""fewer high-profile women artists in cycle with major releases"" than in 2021.

The Brit Awards' organisers reportedly plan to evaluate their decision to adopt gender-neutral prizes as part of their annual review after the upcoming ceremony.

This year will be Lizzo's second performance at the event. She's nominated for international artist of the year and international song of the year for her hit About Damn Time, which reached number one in the US and number three in the UK.

The three times Grammy winner has over five billion global streams to her name and had a platinum selling debut album. Her fourth studio album Special was released to critical acclaim last year, reaching number two on the Billboard 200 chart and the UK Top Ten.

She performed a medley of songs at the 2020 Brit Awards, and delighted fans at one point in the evening by cosying up to pal Harry Styles and downing a drink from his table.

Alexander Papadopoulos, 28, of Whitehall, was jailed for six months by Bristol Crown Court on Monday after he pleaded guilty to arson during the ""kill the bill"" protests.

Footage from the investigation showed Papadopoulos stoking the fire at the mobile police station, which included launching a chair through the door to fan the flames.

He was also seen wearing a police helmet, which he admitted to stealing, meaning he was given an additional seven days in prison, with the sentences running concurrently.

The judge said Papadopoulos's actions helped the fire which destroyed the mobile police station, adding he had taken the helmet as ""a trophy"".

Detective Superintendent James Riccio said: ""The fire this defendant was involved in stoking and accelerating caused catastrophic damage to a community mobile police station and was one of the more significant criminal acts committed on that shameful night of violence.

Five firefighters were injured during the incident at the former department store on Monday.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said four have since been discharged from hospital after treatment, but one is still apparently fighting for their life.

Speaking on Tuesday morning, Edinburgh City Council leader Cammy Day said the cause of the fire is still unknown, and that the SFRS along with a surveying team were investigating.

""Obviously there was construction work happening on the old Jenners building, so we'll find out in the next coming days,"" he said.

The alarm was raised in the city's Rose Street shortly before 11.30am.

On arrival, firefighters found the iconic building ""well alight"".

At its height, 22 appliances and other specialist resources were sent to tackle the flames.

In an update on Tuesday morning, SFRS said crews were still at the scene with a single appliance to monitor the building for any remaining ""hotspots"".

She said: ""Their sheer bravery and professionalism must be commended.

""Scotland's communities are lucky to have our valued firefighters who stand ready to put their personal safety at risk in order to save others. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.""

Ross Haggart, interim chief officer with SFRS, said: ""The fire at the Jenners building in Edinburgh is a very serious and complex incident and regrettably I can confirm that five of our colleagues were taken to hospital for treatment.

""Four have now been discharged however one remains in a critical condition.

""The families of all those affected have been made aware.""

The building, which Jenners moved into in 1895, is one of the best known in the Scottish capital.

The closure of the store, which was then controlled by Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, was announced in 2021.

Caroline Nokes said there are ""too many unanswered questions"" over the former chancellor's multi-million pound tax dispute and that he is ""leading too many front pages"".

""When you become the story it's a distraction from anything else the government is trying to do,"" she told TalkTV.

""And I really think in order to get this cleared up Nadhim should stand aside and let the investigation run its course.""

Politics news - latest: Tory party turning on Zahawi

On Monday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ordered a potentially far-reaching investigation into Mr Zahawi but resisted calls to sack him, saying he retained ""confidence"" in his colleague.

The inquiry by new ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus is expected to focus on whether the cabinet minister breached the ministerial code with the HMRC settlement he made while he was chancellor, but it could extend to his prior tax arrangement and whether he lied to the media.

Sky News understands that, as part of a settlement with HMRC, Mr Zahawi paid a penalty to the tax collector.

The exact size of the settlement has not been disclosed, but it is reported to be an estimated £4.8m including a 30% penalty.

Questions were first raised about Mr Zahawi's tax affairs last summer when he was running to be party leader, but the senior Tory MP insisted at the time that he was ""clearly being smeared"" and had always paid his taxes.

Other Tories are privately turning on Mr Zahawi, with one former minister telling Sky News: ""He's toast.""

Opposition parties are calling for him to be sacked while Lord Bob Kerslake, the former head of the Civil Service, told Sky News Mr Zahawi is in a ""pretty perilous position"" as several facts need clarifying - including the length of his tax investigation and what he told Mr Sunak about it.

Earlier, Home Office minister Chris Philp suggested the PM was not aware Mr Zahawi had paid a penalty to the taxman, or of any prior investigation into him, when he appointed him as party chairman.

Mr Sunak defended Mr Zahawi in the House of Commons last week, but this was before the cabinet minister released a statement admitting he paid what HMRC said ""was due"" after it ""disagreed about the exact allocation"" of shares in YouGov - the polling company he co-founded - an error he noted was ""careless not deliberate"".

Asked today if the PM was confident that Mr Zahawi had always told the truth about his tax affairs, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The investigation looks at any potential breaches of the ministerial code.

""As you'll know, I won't get into being prescriptive about how the advice goes about ascertaining that.""

The spokesman could not say when the inquiry would return its findings but insisted the investigation will be done ""swiftly"".

Sources close to Mr Zahawi are maintaining he is ""absolutely not standing down"", and he refused to answer questions on his political future when approached by journalists this morning.

By Rob Harris, sports correspondent

Russian football teams are set to remain banned from European competitions as the war on Ukraine continues, Sky News understands.

Russia is also set to be stripped of hosting the UEFA Super Cup – the showpiece men's game between the Champions League and Europa League winners – that was due to be staged in Kazan in August.

Ahead of a meeting of UEFA's executive committee tomorrow, Russian Football Union leaders were set for talks with officials from European football's governing body.

Russian state media said there was a desire for Russian Football Union officials to use the meeting to discuss the return of clubs and national teams to international tournaments.

But it's understood there is no immediate chance of UEFA allowing the return of Russian teams while the war launched by Vladimir Putin continues.

UEFA - along with FIFA - suspended Russian teams last February until further notice, within days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine being launched.

Analysis by Megan Baynes, cost of living reporter

The promise of up to £100 off your energy bill seems like a great deal, all for the price of turning off your lights for a few short hours.

But can sitting in the dark really save you £100?

Households are being promised savings if they cut back their electricity use during certain peak hours - with the first real run of the Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) taking place last night and today.

It seems like a no-brainer amid an energy crisis that has left millions struggling with their monthly payments.

I'm with Octopus Energy and opted into their Saving Sessions as soon as they became available on the app. The energy provider has run five since November.

Of these, I opted into four (I forgot to click to opt in to one on 30 November) and diligently turned off the electricity as much as possible during the set time periods.

Washing machine? Off. Lights? Off. TV? Off. Heating? Off.

I even timed to be out during one of them, to guarantee I wasn't using any electricity.

My savings so far? £2.36.

So, is it worth it?

I only live with one other person - unless you count the two cats - which means our energy usage is already relatively low, and we struggled to cut back any further. This resulted in very minimal savings through the scheme.

We use the washing machine a few times a week (at most) and already did it during the day, and my irregular work hours mean I often cook dinner later at night after peak time has already passed.

Like us, if you already have fairly low energy usage - or use it mainly out of peak demand - you may find you can't quite cut back to the percentage required to save money.

Indeed, during two of the sessions, we didn't save a single penny (including one time when we went weren't in the property).

I am also reluctant to turn off any of the constantly-on appliances in my home (the fridge and freezer) because if I'm only going to be saving a few pennies, is it worth the risk of all my food going rancid?

But it's never a bad idea to consider how much energy you use and try to cut back (whatever time of day) and you lose absolutely nothing from opting in.

In fact, despite my minimal savings, I would recommend anyone who can sign up for the scheme does so - every penny counts.

Households who were already using a lot of energy during peak hours (5pm to 9pm) will likely find they save more by shifting their schedules around by an hour. But for smaller households, or those with irregular hours, be aware that your rewards may be much lower than the promised £100.

Plus, the main reason behind these sessions isn't really money - it's reducing the UK's energy consumption in a bid to prevent blackouts.

So I'll continue to sign up for every session, and dutifully turn off most of the appliances in my home, at the very least to try and take some pressure off the National Grid.

And who knows - maybe this session will be the one where I save enough to make it worth it.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124120238/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-extraordinary-uk-borrowing-figures-revealed-as-cost-of-energy-support-becomes-clear-12615118

He said he is confident he was given the job ""on merit"" after an investigation was launched into his hiring.

The BBC is also reporting that Mr Sharp has no plans to stand down despite scrutiny of his appointment.

Politics live: Tory party turning on Zahawi

The former banker has confirmed he introduced his close friend Sam Blyth to cabinet secretary Simon Case in late 2020, to discuss whether Mr Blyth could act as a guarantor for a loan facility for Mr Johnson.

The talks took place while Mr Johnson was still prime minister, and while Mr Sharp was in the process of applying to be BBC chair.

In an interview with the broadcaster today, Mr Sharp said that a decision was made by Mr Case that there was no conflict of interest, nor the perception of one.

He said: ""Having had a discussion with the cabinet secretary about avoiding a conflict - and the perception of conflict - I felt comfortable and I still feel there was no conflict because at that stage what I was seeking to do was to ensure the process was followed exactly by the book, and that the process hadn't started, of any kind, in terms of any support that Sam [Blyth] was going to provide to the prime minister.""

Mr Blyth is a multimillionaire Canadian businessman and distant relative of Mr Johnson.

The Sunday Times reported he ended up being a guarantor of a loan of £800,000 to the former PM, who oversaw Mr Sharp's appointment.

Timeline November 2020:

According to the Sunday Times the loan guarantee was first suggested by Canadian millionaire Sam Blyth during a dinner with Richard Sharp. Early December 2020:

In early December, Richard Sharp put Sam Blyth in contact with the Cabinet Secretary, Simon Case. Late 2020:

Before the end of the year, Richard Sharp and Sam Blyth met with Boris Johnson for dinner at his country residence, Chequers. They insist the prime minister's finances were not discussed. January 2021:

At the start of January, the government announced Richard Sharp as the preferred candidate to be BBC chairman.

Asked if he thought he had misled a parliamentary committee or the advisory panel which picked him, Mr Sharp said: ""No, I don't.""

He added: ""I had clarified and agreed with the cabinet secretary, both of us had the judgement that I'd avoided a conflict or a perception of conflict.""

Pressed on whether the row was an issue at a time when the BBC is making efforts to be impartial and highlight transparency, Mr Sharp told his own news channel: ""Well look I see attacks on the BBC all the time, from the media, and for example social media, and they attack our impartiality.

""And I think the governance we put in place is extremely strong on impartiality and I'll be talking about it later today, precisely because we should be judged by our output.""

The BBC is reviewing any conflict of interest related to Mr Sharp's role while William Shawcross, the Commissioner for Public Appointments, has opened an investigation into the competition which led to his appointment.

Jenner arrived at Schiaparelli's couture runway show in Paris wearing a dress from the designer's collection featuring a fake lion's head.

The gown, designed by Schiaparelli, prompted accusations of promoting animal cruelty and glamorising trophy hunting - but some animal rights activists came out in support of the collection.

A nearly identical version of the dress was later modelled on the runway by Irina Shayk.

Dresses featuring a faux-taxidermy snow leopard and a wolf modelled by Naomi Campbell were also seen in the show.

Schiaparelli posted a video of Jenner on Instagram, detailing the materials used to make the lion: ""Hand sculpted foam, wool and silk faux fur... hand painted to look as life-like as possible.""

The brand added in capital letters: ""NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED IN MAKING THIS LOOK.""

But Carrie Johnson, animal rights campaigner and wife of former prime minister Boris Johnson, described the designs as ""grim"", writing on Instagram: ""Real or fake this just promotes trophy hunting. Yuck.""

However, animal rights charity PETA - which named Mrs Johnson as its ""person of the year"" in 2020 - came out in defence of the fake looks.

In a statement, PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk told Sky News: ""Kylie's look celebrates lions' beauty and may be a statement against trophy hunting, in which lion families are torn apart to satisfy human egotism.

""These fabulously innovative three-dimensional animal heads show that where there's a will, there's a way.""

Despite PETA's stance, many people expressed their distaste with Schiaparelli's designs on the brand's Instagram page.

One commenter wrote: ""No matter how you justify it to your models and celebrities - the faux animal couture is a huge problem with implications you don't understand... Even though NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED the concept promotes wearing animals for fashion and a disgusting out of touch mentality the elite continue to suffer from.""

Another comment, which has received thousands of likes, said: ""We have to stop showing animals as luxury

'products'. They may be made from foam, but these are endangered species that have historically been killed for their pelts to be turned into garments.""

There were those who came to the brand's defence however, with some saying the designs were art and were purposefully provocative.

One person wrote: ""The whole point of haute couture is to be an art performance, a concept, shown on a person. It's art, and the concept here is Dante's inferno.""

Ministers also rejected a recommendation to make menopause a protected characteristic under the Equalities Act.

Caroline Nokes, chair of the women and equalities committee - which submitted 12 recommendations aimed at giving working women more rights in a report last July - accused the government of a ""complacent"" response.

The Tory MP added that the government had ignored a ""significant evidence base"" that the menopause should be a protected characteristic.

A survey last year found one in 10 women who worked during the menopause had left a job due to their symptoms, while others had reduced their hours, gone part-time, or not applied for promotion.

The government rejected five of the committee's suggestions on Tuesday, arguing that the proposal for a menopause leave policy would be ""counterproductive"" and that it was also wary of creating ""discrimination risks towards men suffering from long-term medical conditions, or eroding existing protections"".

The government said: ""We are focusing our efforts on disseminating best practice and encouraging employers to implement workplace menopause policies and other forms of support such as flexible working, which can play a vital role in supporting people to remain in work.""

Ms Nokes' letter to health minister Maria Caulfield called it a ""missed opportunity to protect vast numbers of talented and experienced women from leaving the workforce, and leaves me unconvinced that menopause is a government priority"".

She said there should be ""urgent action"" to address women's needs, but progress has been ""glacial"" and the government's response has been ""complacent"".

China's extreme weather in pictures as temperature drops to a record -53C in city

Temperatures in parts of northern China have dropped to their lowest ever, with -53C (-63F) recorded in one city.

State broadcaster CCTV said a weather station in Mohe, in Heilongjiang province, logged the record low on Sunday, breaking the city's previous record of -52 (-61F) degrees in 1969.

The channel said Mohe, which has the nickname ""North Pole village"", had experienced temperatures of below -50C (-58F) for three consecutive days over the weekend, with the severe cold weather expected to continue.

China's national meteorological centre renewed a cold wave alert on Tuesday, forecasting more freezing weather conditions and strong winds across eastern and southern regions.

Sky News meteorologist Joanna Robinson said: ""An intense cold surge has been affecting a large part of eastern Asia, which is not unusual at this time of the year when winds can bring in Siberian air.

""Very low temperatures have been seen across parts of eastern Russia and northeastern China, some 15 to 20C lower than average in places.

""The current extreme weather follows one of China's worst heatwaves which was experienced last year. The heatwave lasted over two months and saw more than 250 weather stations recording their highest temperature.""

Jacob Rees-Mogg has said the Conservatives should learn from Labour's Wes Streeting after he called for ""fundamental reform"" of the NHS.

The shadow health secretary told parliament earlier this month that the government was ""sticking plasters"" on the health service and called for a massive workforce expansion.

In an interview with The Guardian on Friday, Mr Streeting denied reforms would mean more privatisation, instead suggesting the private sector should be used to tackle waiting lists in the short-term and to develop technology.

Today, Mr Rees-Mogg said Conservatives should take Mr Streeting seriously, as his comments ""reflect the political appetite for reform.""

Talking on The Moggcast, the backbencher said: ""I'm really interested that Wes Streeting, obviously a Labour politician, is talking about reforming the NHS, which the Conservatives have shied away from.

""But that is something we are going to have to talk about because the NHS is not working as it should and we cannot endlessly go on spending more money and thinking that there is somebody else who will pay for it.""

He continued: ""What he [Streeting] is saying is so important because I think that reflects the political appetite for reform and Tories therefore need to be thinking about it very seriously.""

Mr Rees-Mogg did not comment on the specific proposals put forward by Mr Streeting and Labour, which include scrapping the non-dom tax status to fund more medical school places and allowing patients to self-refer to specialists.

The party also plans to force GPs to provide face-to-face appointments to those who want them, introduce online-booking to more services and ""bring back the family doctor.""

Households are being promised savings if they cut back their electricity use during certain peak hours - with the first real run of the Demand Flexibility Service (DFS) taking place last night and today.

It seems like a no-brainer amid an energy crisis that has left millions struggling with their monthly payments.

I'm with Octopus Energy and opted into their Saving Sessions as soon as they became available on the app. The energy provider has run five since November.

Of these, I opted into four (I forgot to click to opt in to one on 30 November) and diligently turned off the electricity as much as possible during the set time periods.

Washing machine? Off. Lights? Off. TV? Off. Heating? Off.

I even timed to be out during one of them, to guarantee I wasn't using any electricity.

My savings so far? £2.36.

So, is it worth it?

I only live with one other person - unless you count the two cats - which means our energy usage is already relatively low, and we struggled to cut back any further. This resulted in very minimal savings through the scheme.

We use the washing machine a few times a week (at most) and already did it during the day, and my irregular work hours mean I often cook dinner later at night after peak time has already passed.

Like us, if you already have fairly low energy usage - or use it mainly out of peak demand - you may find you can't quite cut back to the percentage required to save money.

Indeed, during two of the sessions, we didn't save a single penny (including one time when we went weren't in the property).

I am also reluctant to turn off any of the constantly-on appliances in my home (the fridge and freezer) because if I'm only going to be saving a few pennies, is it worth the risk of all my food going rancid?

But it's never a bad idea to consider how much energy you use and try to cut back (whatever time of day) and you lose absolutely nothing from opting in.

In fact, despite my minimal savings, I would recommend anyone who can sign up for the scheme does so - every penny counts.

Households who were already using a lot of energy during peak hours (5pm to 9pm) will likely find they save more by shifting their schedules around by an hour. But for smaller households, or those with irregular hours, be aware that your rewards may be much lower than the promised £100.

Plus, the main reason behind these sessions isn't really money - it's reducing the UK's energy consumption in a bid to prevent blackouts.

So I'll continue to sign up for every session, and dutifully turn off most of the appliances in my home, at the very least to try and take some pressure off the National Grid.

And who knows - maybe this session will be the one where I save enough to make it worth it.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124123254/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-two-reasons-behind-big-rise-in-house-sales-collapsing-12615118
364;Chinese New Year shooting: What we know about California attack gunman Huu Can Tran;Tuesday 24 January 2023 12:31, UK;[];['california'];['tran', 'trans', 'chinese', 'california', 'studio', 'park', 'mr', 'hood', 'used', 'shooting', 'dance', 'monterey', 'attack', 'know', 'huu', 'gunman', 'told'];"The sole suspect in a Chinese New Year shooting which killed 11 people at a California dance hall has been named as Huu Can Tran.

Nine others were wounded in the massacre, with further deaths averted by the heroic actions of a worker who disarmed Tran when he entered a second dance hall in Los Angeles County, apparently wielding a gun.

The 72-year-old fatally shot himself after fleeing the scene as police closed in on his van.

He had once been a dance teacher at the same venue where he is accused of opening fire, it has emerged.

As police piece together what happened, those who knew him have shared other details about the alleged shooter.

Here is what we know so far about him.

Tran's links to the dance studio

Tran was reportedly a regular at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park, where he is said to have fired 42 rounds on Saturday night (21 January).

An ex-wife of Tran's told CNN she met him at the studio about 20 years ago, and that he used to give lessons there.

A long-time acquaintance of Tran's said he would go to the studio almost every night in the late 2000s and early 2010s.

They told CNN he was ""hostile to a lot of people there"" and that Tran had claimed the instructors at the time didn't like him and said ""evil things about him"".

It is unclear if Tran had been to the dance studio in recent times and if he knew anyone who was inside during the shooting.

Quick to anger but 'never violent' before

Tran's ex-wife told CNN Tran was never violent but he was quick to anger - for instance, if she missed a step while dancing.

A tenant of Tran's, Adam Hood, told Reuters Tran was an angry, aggressive person who did not have many friends but liked ballroom dancing, his main social activity.

""He was a good dancer,"" said Mr Hood, who met Tran in the early 2000s and said they bonded over their shared experience as Chinese immigrants.

""But he was distrustful of the people at the studio, angry and distrustful. I think he just had enough.""

Tran complained that people at the studio were talking behind his back, Mr Hood added.

Tran's personal life

The shooting suspect lived at a mobile home park for over-55s in Hemet, California, about 65 miles east of where the murders took place.

He used to live closer to the dance studio. Records show he lived in San Gabriel, near Monterey Park, from the early 1990s until around 2014.

Tran and his ex-wife divorced in 2005. He never remarried and did not have a girlfriend, according to Mr Hood.

Tran had an active trucking licence and used to own a company called Tran's Trucking that he started in 2002.

Interactions with police

Police in Monterey Park had no prior interactions with Tran, police chief Scott Wiese said at a news conference on Monday.

But Tran had visited Hemet police twice this month to report he was the victim of fraud, theft and poisoning by family members a decade or two ago in the LA area, Hemet police spokesperson Alan Reyes told The Associated Press.

Tran said he would return to the station with documentation but never did.

After the shootings, sheriff's deputies from Los Angeles County searched Tran's home and found a .308-calibre rifle, an unknown amount of bullets and evidence he was making homemade firearm suppressors that muffle the sound of the weapons.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124123254/http://news.sky.com/story/chinese-new-year-shooting-what-we-know-about-california-attack-gunman-huu-can-tran-12794082

Sky News has learnt that the trustees of the Arcadia Group pension scheme are close to striking a binding deal with Aviva to guarantee its members' incomes.

City sources said a formal agreement was likely within weeks, with Aviva understood to have seen off competition from rival insurance companies, including Pension Insurance Corporation (PIC).

If concluded, it would bring to an end negotiations about one of the UK's most contentious corporate pension schemes.

The fate of Arcadia's pensioners, comprising employees of prominent chains including Burton, Dorothy Perkins and Topshop, has been in the balance since Sir Philip was forced to put the group into administration in the autumn of 2020.

The retailer had been in financial trouble for some time, hurt by consumers' switch to online shopping and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sir Philip was in negotiations with The Pensions Regulator for months before Arcadia's collapse, and agreed to inject a substantial sum into the scheme.

His fraught discussions with the watchdog were precipitated by the political row which engulfed the tycoon in the aftermath of the collapse of BHS, the department store chain, in 2016.

A memorable select committee hearing with MPs that year saw the then billionaire castigated for his decision to offload BHS to Dominic Chappell, a now-imprisoned bankrupt, for just £1.

Along with wife Lady Tina, Sir Philip eventually committed more than £350m to boost payouts to BHS's pension scheme members, but not without an ugly critique of his conduct by parliamentarians.

The precise structure of the deal between the Arcadia trustees and Aviva was unclear on Tuesday, but one insider said it was expected to involve members receiving full benefits - albeit potentially with more limited future increases than current inflation levels would justify.

Arcadia members are certain to receive superior payouts to those they would have got through the Pension Protection Fund lifeboat, which effectively guarantees benefits worth 90% of pension pots to unretired members.

The last public figure for Arcadia's pension liabilities was in the order of £1bn, although the current figure was unclear.

Many retirement schemes have seen deficits shrink in recent months as interest rates have risen.

Aviva and a spokesperson for Arcadia's pension trustees both declined to comment.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124124720/http://news.sky.com/story/topshop-pensioners-fashion-1bn-funding-deal-with-aviva-12794184

Haris Namani, a 21-year-old TV salesman from Doncaster, would be the second islander to leave the show should he exit the villa.

A Love Island spokesperson told Sky News: ""We would never comment on dumpings or show formats to avoid ruining the show for the viewers.""

On Monday, mobile phone filmed footage showing Namani fighting in the street was published by The Sun.

In the video, Namani, who is also a boxer, can be seen trading blows with the man, hitting him once in the face, before the man stumbles and is then knocked to the ground with a second blow.

A man filming the fight can be heard saying: ""Go on Haris"".

After hitting the man for the second time, Haris shouts: ""I'm not a bully, I'm not a f***ing bully, on my mum's life.""

First shared on Snapchat, it's understood to have been filmed on a night out in Haris's hometown of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, last year.

Speaking before entering the show, Namani described himself as never having been in love, and said his mum says he looks like Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo.

Last week on the show, Namani was involved in a row with fellow contestant Shaq Muhammad, an airport security officer, with the pair shouting at each other until others intervened to calm things down.

Ahead of this year's show, ITV announced new welfare measures in a bid to support contributors before, during and after filming.

Changes came after previous islanders Mike Thalassitis, 26, and Sophie Gradon, 32, took their own lives after appearing on the show.

Fresh duty of care protocols include enhanced behaviour training and extended measures to protect the islanders from the adverse effects of social media and handling potential negativity.

367;Sea spiders can regrow lost anuses and sex organs - leaving scientists stunned;Tuesday 24 January 2023 13:23, UK;[];[];['research', 'lost', 'anuses', 'regrow', 'leaving', 'professor', 'body', 'regeneration', 'spiders', 'scientists', 'scholtz', 'regenerate', 'sea', 'arthropods', 'study', 'stunned', 'sex', 'organs'];"Scientists say they are stunned after discovering sea spiders have the ability to grow new reproductive organs and an anus.

Experts already knew that when the arthropods lose legs, they can regrow them.

But in a development that will no doubt inspire the next generation of Spider-Man stories, a study has found the underwater creatures have regenerative powers which extend to their entire bottom halves.

""Nobody had expected this,"" said the lead researcher behind the breakthrough in understanding, Professor Gerhard Scholtz.

Other arthropods - invertebrates with no internal skeleton or backbone, but which do have an exoskeleton - such as centipedes and crabs, are also capable of regrowing limbs.

Some creatures can go further, with starfish able to regenerate their entire bodies on occasion - and lizards able to produce a new tail.

""If you look at the animal kingdom, the capability of regeneration differs very much in various groups of animals,"" Professor Scholtz told Sky News.

""Flatworms, for example, can regenerate their whole body from a limited amount of tissue.

""On the other hand, us - mammals - cannot regenerate much - liver, tissue, skin, but apart from that very little.

""For arthropods - crustaceans, insects, myriapods, and types of spider - it was entirely unknown that they could regenerate body parts other than limbs.""

The study, which has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, saw the hind limbs and backends of 23 sea spiders amputated.

While four older spiders did not regrow anything, most of the 19 juveniles did.

Sixteen of them regenerated at least one lost body part, 14 recovered their posterior, and 90% survived long-term despite the amputations.

Until now, it was thought that the spiders' hard exoskeleton prevented any regeneration beyond the limbs, added Professor Scholtz. But his research found the creatures were recreating body parts within ""several weeks or months"".

The regenerations did not always go smoothly - some spiders were a leg or two short.

Hope 'always there' for amputation breakthrough

Professor Scholtz, of Humboldt University of Berlin's Institute for Biology, said the findings should inspire further study into different species.

""One has to look to other arthropods and whether they can do the same,"" he said.

He is planning further research by reproducing the study with insects, crabs and other crustaceans.

And the breakthrough could be transformative for health care.

Such research could one day advance treatments for human amputees.

""The hope is always there,"" said Professor Scholtz.

""I don't think the sea spiders will play a crucial role, but who knows? The more you know about regeneration in the animal kingdom, the better you might be able to use it for medical treatment.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124140210/http://news.sky.com/story/sea-spiders-can-regrow-lost-anuses-and-sex-organs-leaving-scientists-stunned-12794124

Speaking to Sky News' Beth Rigby, Justin Welby described the issue of how to plug the gap in social care funding as ""one of the most fundamental questions affecting our country, morally and ethically"".

The archbishop said he believes the rate of tax all individuals pay must be increased to cover rising costs in the social care sector.

He said increased funds are ""going to have to come from taxation, which means from all of us"" but stressed that ""it has to be seen to be just and fair to meet the values we want as a society"".

Asked whether the burden should fall on people's estates, or be obtained by general taxation or a mix, Mr Welby added: ""It's a mix. It's always going to be a mix.""

He also dismissed criticism that intervening in political issues isn't his job, saying: ""I would say caring for people is very much my job and is very much the the role of the church.""

Tories turning on Nadhim Zahawi - politics latest

Former prime minister Boris Johnson pledged to ""fix social care"" during his premiership.

But the plans to raise taxes to help fund the sector, which he announced while in Number 10, did not become a reality.

Asked whether he was dismayed when these plans to increase taxation to generate more income for the social care sector came to nothing, the archbishop said: ""Not dismayed, but certainly it's disappointing.

""Though one has to recognise that politicians have enormously difficult questions of priority, but this is one of the most fundamental questions affecting our country, morally and ethically.

""But also because it has ramifications and effects all over the country.

""It has effects on hospitals, it has effects on families, it has effects on people who need care and people with learning difficulties. People who are elderly - we all know people who need care and support, many of us help with caring for people.""

Pressed on whether he believes politicians have not done enough to resolve the issues the sector is facing, Mr Welby told Sky News: ""Oh, I am not going to get into that sort of blame game.

""It is not about whether they have done a good enough job or not.

""We are where we are, but what can be done about the future?""

Elsewhere in the wide-ranging interview, the archbishop admitted he has received ""flack"" from within the Church of England following bishops' ""controversial"" proposals on same-sex marriage.

Mr Welby acknowledged that the church's latest compromise - rejecting same-sex marriage while backing clergy blessings of civil same-sex marriage - has led to criticism that ""traditional Christian standards"" have been compromised.

The archbishop also admitted that it is ""not comfortable"" that in his current role, he is not able to bless same-sex marriages.

The Church of England has outlined plans to bless same-sex couples who are legally married.

However, under the proposals, same-sex couples still would still not be able to marry in the church and blessings for civil gay marriages would be on a voluntary basis for clergy.

Campaigners hoping to see same-sex marriage legalised in the church plan to table a vote next month that would test support for the move in the General Synod, the church's legislative assembly.

Asked whether he accepts there is a credibility after calling for inclusion but arguably discriminating against the LGBT community, Mr Welby admitted: ""That is what people might think.""

He continued: ""First, we have made a huge step which is to say that if someone is married in a civil marriage, equal marriage, to someone of their own gender - same sex marriage - that they can come to church, can have that marriage recognised and thanked for and dedicate themselves to God and seek God's blessing in their lives.

""And that is something that we have never done before.

""And it is controversial. I am getting an equal amount of flack from the other side about having compromised traditional Christian standards.""

Probed as to whether he would personally bless same-sex marriages if he were not archbishop, Mr Welby replied: ""I support the use of these resources… so they bless the people in same sex marriages.""

Asked whether it is difficult not to be able to do what he personally would like to do, he added: ""No, I accept that it is part of my role. It is just the way it is.""

Pressed on whether he accepts there is a conflict surrounding the issue which is uncomfortable, the archbishop admitted that it is ""not comfortable"", adding that ""the church is deeply divided over this issue"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124140210/http://news.sky.com/story/justin-welby-archbishop-says-it-is-disappointing-politicians-have-failed-to-resolve-social-care-issue-12794165

London Fire Brigade (LFB) made the rescue in Leytonstone, and had to use water rescue equipment to bring the pair to safety.

LFB added they were stuck ""quite a way"" from the shore when they were rescued.

A spokesperson said: ""Walking out on to frozen ponds or lakes is extremely dangerous. Never assume that the ice is thick enough to support you.

""It may look sturdy enough to stand on, but it often isn't and can be of variable thickness especially as you move away from the edge where the ice is often thinner. If you fall into icy water, the risk of hypothermia is very high and can prove fatal.

""We see a number of people who put themselves in danger by attempting to rescue pets that have become stranded or trapped, and then they also need to be rescued by the brigade. Dog owners should keep them on a lead and keep a close eye on them.

""Firefighters are trained and have specialist equipment to rescue those who do get stuck on, or in, an icy lake or pond, so if you see a person or an animal in difficulty don't put yourself at risk by going in after them. Call 999, keep your eye on them and stay off the ice.""

The sci-fi fantasy, which has been a word-of-mouth hit around the world, landed 11 nominations, closely followed by The Banshees Of Inisherin and All Quiet On The Western Front with nine nods each.

Somewhat unusually, the prestigious best picture category included films that performed brilliantly at the box office as well as pleasing the critics, with Top Gun: Maverick, Avatar: The Way Of Water and Elvis all making the cut.

In another first for the category, two sequels were nominated - Top Gun and Avatar. Only eight sequels have ever made the cut in Oscar history, and never before have two been chosen in a single year.

Last year, in a bid to open it up to genres that might not be typically thought of as Oscars-material, the best picture category was expanded to 10 films.

The best actor category saw five first time nominees, with British star Bill Nighy getting his first nod for his portrayal of a buttoned-up businessman learning to enjoy life.

Nominations across 23 categories were announced by Oscar-winner actor and producer Riz Ahmed and Girls star Allison Williams.

Three hundred and one films were eligible for this year's awards, which will take place in March, in a star-studded ceremony hosted by US chat show host Jimmy Kimmel.

All nominated movies must have opened in a commercial motion picture theatre in at least one of six US metropolitan areas between 1 January and 31 December, last year.

374;'Children as young as three' queueing for food at night soup kitchen in Glasgow, says charity boss;Tuesday 24 January 2023 14:18, UK;[];['cost of living', 'edinburgh', 'glasgow', 'homelessness', 'scotland'];['boss', 'kitchen', 'scottish', 'city', 'homeless', 'project', 'children', 'charity', 'mcinnes', 'glasgow', 'soup', 'queueing', 'scotland', 'young', 'food', 'night'];"A homelessness charity boss has said he was shocked to see more than 10 children lining up for hot food at a Glasgow soup kitchen.

Colin McInnes, who co-founded Homeless Project Scotland in 2019, said it was a ""reflection on today's politicians"".

Mr McInnes claimed there were youngsters as young as three who had been brought along by their parents, as well as a child in a pram on Friday night.

He told Sky News: ""It was a big shocker to us. My message to politicians is this: They need to step up and deal with this or step aside and let someone else deal with it.""

Homeless Project Scotland (HPS) runs a soup kitchen seven nights a week under Glasgow's Hielanman's Umbrella next to Central Station in the city centre.

Mr McInnes claimed one mum made the trip from Paisley in Renfrewshire more than 10 miles away to stock up on food.

The charity chief added that he has noticed more people filling up bags with food so as they can freeze it to use later in the week.

He said: ""We're feeding 310 people a day. We're the largest soup kitchen in Scotland and what's extremely difficult to understand is that it's only 20 minutes from Nicola Sturgeon's constituency.""

The First Minister, who is MSP for Glasgow Southside, was reportedly invited to visit the soup kitchen more than a year ago but is yet to take up the offer.

A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The first minister regularly visits and engages with different organisations and groups to help inform the Scottish government's efforts to tackle homelessness and the housing secretary visited Homeless Project Scotland last year.

""We're taking action to end homelessness in Scotland once and for all, and are working closely with Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership, including meeting with them regularly to keep up to date with developments in the city.""

The Scottish government added it is providing £52.5m to support local authorities in implementing rapid housing and Housing First approaches. Earlier this month it announced a further £2.4m to help those struggling to buy food amid the cost of living crisis.

As well as the soup kitchen, Homeless Project Scotland also distributes sim cards for free phone calls and hygiene packages to those in need.

At the weekend, the charity's street team was sent to Edinburgh after a ""high level"" of rough sleepers were reported to its helpline.

Sky News has contacted City of Edinburgh Council for comment.

Mr McInnes said: ""Edinburgh was pretty horrific. People are walking about with quilts under their arms - a quilt under your arm and a soggy pavement is not a home.""

The Scotland-wide charity, which has 1,800 volunteers, uses money donated by members of the public to buy and cook food for the Glasgow soup kitchen.

It is currently on the lookout for a building in which to create a welfare centre that is open 24-hours a day, seven days a week.

Mr McInnes said: ""It might give people hope and that sense of warmth that someone cares about them. We're not looking for a building for free, just one that's affordable.""

The charity is appealing to Glasgow City Council, the Scottish government and private landlords for help.

Glasgow City Council said it has tried to find a building, however none of the options so far have been deemed suitable by the charity.

A spokesperson said: ""We have tried to find a suitable building for HPS to host their evening soup kitchen, but they have rejected the three options offered to them.

""HPS recently told us they now want somewhere that can open round-the-clock with a capacity for over 200 people.

""We are very sorry, but we just don't have a place that matches the revised requirements set out by HPS.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124154708/http://news.sky.com/story/children-as-young-as-three-queueing-for-food-at-night-soup-kitchen-in-glasgow-says-charity-boss-12793726
375;A glimmer of hope for public finances but don't expect giveaway spring budget;Tuesday 24 January 2023 14:42, UK;['ian king', '@iankingsky'];[];['energy', 'giveaway', 'spring', 'set', 'budget', 'inflation', 'sector', 'expect', 'tax', 'support', 'borrowing', 'dont', 'month', 'hope', 'public', 'glimmer', 'big', 'finances'];"At first blush, the public sector net borrowing figures for December are pretty depressing.

At £27.4bn, the overall figure is not only more than double the revised £10.4bn seen in December 2021, it was also appreciably higher than the £17.7bn that the City had been expecting.

It is the highest December borrowing since the data began being prepared in this way 29 years ago.

The December number was also £9.8bn more than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast only as recently as November last year - although that was due largely to changes in student loan valuations.

For the broader picture, though, you do not have to look too far to find out why borrowing remains so high.

Interest payments on the national debt during the month came in at £17.3bn, the second highest on record, reflecting the fact that interest payments on around a quarter of the national debt (28% to be precise) are linked to the rate of inflation.

When inflation goes up, so do interest payments.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) noted that, of that £17.3bn, some £13.7bn reflected the impact of inflation on index-linked goods.

It underlines why the government's primary economic focus remains bringing down inflation and why it is taking such a hard line on public sector pay awards.

The other big element of spending, costing nearly £7bn during the month, reflected the extraordinary sums being thrown by the government at supporting households and businesses with their energy bills.

All that meant government spending during the month exceeded what the government raked in.

The latter figure came in at £74.6bn during the month, up £3.9bn on December 2021, most of which - some £3.4bn - was in the form of extra taxes.

These, in some cases, have been growing quite nicely from the government's point of view.

VAT receipts for the month were up 4.9% on December 2021, which could well reflect the fact that inflation is pushing higher the absolute sums being spent by consumers, while corporation tax receipts were up 11.5% and income tax receipts collected via PAYE were up 9.7%.

The latter is in part testament to some of the big pay increases being seen now, particularly in the private sector, some of which have even been exceeding the rate of inflation in some categories. These are likely to continue to rise as the year goes on thanks to the decision by Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, not to raise income tax thresholds in line with inflation - 'fiscal drag' as it is known in the jargon.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:19 UK 'could be in for first quarter contraction'

Those frozen thresholds also apply to other taxes. For example, the government is raking in ever-larger sums from Inheritance Tax, the 'nil band' threshold for which has stayed the same since 2010-11 and which, like the main residence nil rate, has been frozen until 2026.

Figures published separately by HM Revenue & Customs brought in £5.3bn in inheritance tax from April to December last year - up £700m on the same period in 2021. That largely reflects higher house prices and means a lot of families who might not necessarily consider themselves to be well-off are now being stung by this unpopular levy.

As Alex Davies, chief executive of the investment broker Wealth Club, observed: ""Contrary to popular belief, inheritance tax doesn't just affect the super-rich, many who would not consider themselves wealthy at all will also bear a considerable burden.

""Rampant inflation and years of frozen allowances and soaring house prices mean many more families will find themselves hit with a hefty inheritance tax bill which they might not have envisaged or planned for.""

The bigger picture is that borrowing so far this financial year stands at £128.1bn, up £5.1bn on the same period last year, albeit £2.7bn less than the OBR was expecting at this stage.

But there is a slight glimmer of hope.

It is that the two big ticket areas that have caused public spending to so outweigh public borrowing are set to moderate.

Inflation looks to have peaked in October last year and is now set to fall steadily.

The economics team at Barclays, for example, forecast that the headline rate of Consumer Prices Inflation will have fallen to 6.3% by July this year and, by December this year, will be down to 3.9%.

That decline in inflation will bring down sharply the inflation-linked element of interest payments on the national debt.

The other big element, the support to households and businesses with their energy bills, is also set to fall sharply as, firstly the government withdraws support and secondly, wholesale energy prices come down.

As Victoria Clarke, UK Chief Economist at Santander CIB, put it: ""The miss against OBR forecasts is not likely to be repeated over the months ahead and so borrowing still appears on track to come in a touch below the £177bn… set out in the November autumn statement.

""Furthermore, there is still more wiggle room in the cash numbers. Further ahead, the government is likely to face lower than predicted fiscal costs for household energy support, after falls in wholesale gas prices.""

Yet that wiggle room is likely to be limited.

There will still be demands from business for support with energy bills while, as was reported in the Sunday press, Mr Hunt is inclined to keep in place the temporary 5p-a-litre cut in fuel duty, introduced in March last year, for a further 12 months. That is a hugely expensive giveaway that would cost the Treasury £6bn.

Moreover, it feels almost inevitable that ministers are going to have to give ground to some public sector pay demands, particularly in the NHS. That will also limit Mr Hunt's room for manoeuvre.

For that reason, even though Mr Hunt is coming under pressure from his backbench MPs to cut taxes in his forthcoming budget, it would be unwise to expect any big giveaways in March.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124154708/http://news.sky.com/story/a-glimmer-of-hope-for-public-finances-but-dont-expect-giveaway-spring-budget-12794287

377;Who is Nadhim Zahawi? The child-refugee turned multi-millionaire politician facing questions about his taxes;Tuesday 24 January 2023 15:22, UK;[];['conservatives', 'nadhim zahawi'];['prime', 'questions', 'mr', 'minister', 'paid', 'nadhim', 'later', 'tax', 'tory', 'facing', 'politician', 'multimillionaire', 'zahawi', 'childrefugee', 'right', 'turned', 'taxes'];"He is a former child refugee who sold Teletubbies merchandise, founded the UK's best known polling company and was once tipped as a frontrunner for prime minister.

But Nadhim Zahawi's rise through the echelons of Westminster is currently being overshadowed by questions around his tax affairs.

So how did the 55-year-old rise to be the toast of the Tories before ending up facing an ethics investigation over the handling of his finances?

Politics latest: 'Hapless' Rishi Sunak's photo-op blew up in his face

Early years

Mr Zahawi was born in Bagdad, Iraq, and spent his early years growing up as part of an influential Kurdish family.

His father was a well-known businessman and his grandfather was the governor of the Central Bank of Iraq.

But after Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979, the dictator began to target the Kurds.

""It was clear to my family Iraq would not be safe under his leadership and that is when we decided we had to flee to the UK,"" Mr Zahawi told his local newspaper, the Stratford Herald.

He arrived in the UK aged 11, unable to speak a word of English, and began his new life by going to Holland Park School in London.

Soon, his family moved him from a comprehensive education to private school, and he studied at both Ibstock Place School, Roehampton, and then King's College School, Wimbledon, both in southwest London.

However, as he was set to go off to university, an investment by his father went belly up and the family lost everything, except for their Vauxhall car.

Mr Zahawi used the vehicle to become a minicab driver to contribute to the family finances, but his mother insisted he carry on studying and pawned her jewellery to cover the costs.

So off he went to University College London to study chemical engineering.

Business endeavours

After graduating in 1988, it was the world of business he wanted to pursue and he sought to echo his father's example as an entrepreneur.

Like his father, it didn't always go right - his setting up of a firm that sold Teletubbies merchandise ended as a ""costly and painful mistake"", he later said.

But it did attract the attention and investment of Lord Jeffrey Archer - who once described him as a ""born organiser"" - and opened doors to the senior ranks of the Conservative Party.

Mr Zahawi became an aide to Lord Archer and in return, the peer helped with his own campaign to become a Tory councillor, winning a seat in the London borough of Wandsworth in 1994.

There was also a failed attempt to enter Parliament in 1997, when he competed for the new seat of Erith and Thamesmead amid a Labour landslide.

Read more: What do we know about Nadhim Zahawi's tax affairs?

He helped with Lord Archer's London mayoral campaign in 1998 too, but it was brought to an early close when the peer pulled out of the race amid controversy.

It was the turn of the millennium that signalled another change in Mr Zahawi's fortunes when, alongside another former aide of Lord Archer's, Stephan Shakespeare, he founded polling company YouGov.

The business grew and grew, and within five years it was floated on the stock market valued at £18m.

He would later tell Sky News he was ""the beneficiary of the British dream"".

According to the Evening Standard, Mr Zahawi cashed in £1.2m of shares in 2005, and went on to work as the firm's CEO for a further five years.

But having made his fortune, he set his sights firmly back on the world of politics and, in 2010, he was elected as the MP for Stratford-upon-Avon.

Image: Mr Zahawi became an MP at the 2010 election.

Masters Of Nothing

A year later, with world still affected by the fallout from the 2008 recession, he co-authored a book with fellow MP Matt Hancock, titled Masters Of Nothing: How The Crash Will Happen Again Unless We Understand Human Nature.

He began to gain some recognition in the party, becoming part of the Number 10 policy unit advising the then prime minister David Cameron.

However, in this early part of his Commons career, he became more known to the public for his part in the 2013 expenses scandal, having claimed cash to power his horses' stables.

It wasn't until 2018 that Mr Zahawi was appointed into his first junior minister post - a parliamentary under secretary at the Department for Education - and a year later he was moved to the business department.

But he became a household name after COVID broke out in the UK and he was appointed by Boris Johnson to become the country's vaccine minister, receiving widespread praise for his work in the Department of Health and Social Care to tackle the pandemic.

Image: As vaccines minister, Mr Zahawi became a household name.

'Do the right thing and go'

The performance propelled him to cabinet and in September 2021, he took his first secretary of state post, back in the Department for Education.

The chaos that ensued the following year as Mr Johnson's downfall played out in public saw him pushed up the ranks again, replacing Rishi Sunak as chancellor in Number 11 after his dramatic resignation.

But two days later, Mr Zahawi joined the growing horde of ministers calling for the PM to step down, telling Mr Johnson: ""You must do the right thing and go now.""

A vacancy was created at the top, and he threw his hat in the ring to become the next Tory leader and next prime minister.

Giving his first broadcast campaign interview to Sky News, Mr Zahawi promised that under his control, the government would reduce corporation tax, income tax and national insurance.

But the issue of his own finances was brought to the fore after reports his tax affairs had been investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, the National Crime Agency and HMRC.

'I was clearly being smeared'

""I was clearly being smeared,"" he told Kay Burley. ""I'm not aware of this. I've always declared my taxes - I've paid my taxes in the UK. I will answer any questions HMRC has of me.

""But I will go further. I will make a commitment today, that if I am prime minister the right thing to do is publish my accounts annually. That is the right thing to do because we need to take this issue off the table.""

Mr Zahawi didn't make it through the first round of balloting, and instead threw his backing behind Liz Truss.

Image: After failing to make it further in the Tory leadership contest, Mr Zahawi gave his backing to Liz Truss.

He carried on in the Treasury until Ms Truss took the keys to Number 10, but was dealt a demotion in her cabinet, instead becoming Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, minister for intergovernmental relations and minister for equalities.

As we know, this premiership was not to last long, and weeks later - under Rishi Sunak - Mr Zahawi was made chairman of the Tory Party.

A seven-figure sum

But those questions raised over the summer regarding his taxes were soon to resurface again.

In January 2023, The Sun On Sunday published a report claiming Mr Zahawi had paid a seven-figure sum to settle a dispute with HMRC over the sales of his YouGov shares.

Sky News made several attempts in the following days to get Mr Zahawi to confirm or deny the story, but his team refused, instead saying his tax affairs ""were and are fully up to date and are paid in the UK"".

Mr Sunak stood by him during Prime Minister's Questions that week, but by the weekend, the swirl of questions was growing by the hour.

'Careless not deliberate error'

On Saturday, he admitted he paid what HMRC said ""was due"" after it ""disagreed about the exact allocation"" of shares in YouGov.

The Tory chairman said this was a ""careless and not a deliberate error"" and didn't confirm if any penalty was also levied.

But Sky News understands that, as part of a settlement with HMRC, Mr Zahawi paid a penalty to the tax collector.

The exact size of the settlement has not been disclosed, but it is reported to be an estimated £4.8m including a 30% penalty.

By Monday, Mr Sunak had ordered a potentially far-reaching investigation into Mr Zahawi to be conducted by the PM's new ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus.

But the prime minister resisted calls to sack Mr Zahawi, saying he retained ""confidence"" in his colleague.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124154708/http://news.sky.com/story/who-is-nadhim-zahawi-the-child-refugee-turned-multi-millionaire-politician-facing-questions-about-his-taxes-12791994

380;Ukraine war - latest: Russians who want to leave country by car may soon have to make online reservation;;[];['live', 'russia', 'ukraine'];['leave', 'ukrainians', 'peace', 'continue', 'online', 'car', 'soon', 'latest', 'taylor', 'ukraine', 'reservation', 'country', 'ceasefire', 'victory', 'way', 'putin', 'war', 'russians'];"Can the path to peace be shortened?

In his speech to Congress last month, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an impassioned plea to lawmakers to continue providing weapons and aid to Ukraine.

Addressing not just Congress but all Americans, he said: ""Your money is not charity. It's an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way. You can speed up our victory.""

The calls came amid a backdrop of intense fighting in the Bakhmut area – a key city in the eastern Donbas region that urgently needs US support.

Now, in a piece for the United States Institute for Peace, William B. Taylor, who served as the US ambassador to Ukraine from 2006-09, has said the best prospect for a shortened war is if ""Ukraine can move quickly to pre-empt the offensive that Putin is scrambling to organise"" and avoid a ceasefire right now.

He states that Ukraine ""must avoid the trap of enabling a renewed assault"" by ""giving Russia time to reinforce its troops"".

Looking at what a ceasefire at this stage in the war would do, he goes on state that it would not bring about the victory that Ukraine is fighting for. He uses the events of Orthodox Christmas as an example.

During this religious period, Russia said it would carry out a short ceasefire in Ukraine but this did not halt attacks.

""A ceasefire now would yield a period of hollow diplomacy that Putin would use to rebuild his resources and then resume his clearly intended goal — to capture Kyiv, install a government of his own preference and turn Ukraine into a vassal state. Clearly, now is not the time for a ceasefire,"" Mr Taylor writes.

He adds that Ukraine has been clear that it is prepared to negotiate but this does not mean it will surrender and therefore the only way for a ""sustainable peace"" right now is to ""continue supporting Ukrainians in ways that can let them establish the conditions for a fair peace process"".

Mr Taylor adds: ""Paths out of war are seldom easy — and in 2023, as last year, the immediate option for peace is in the hands of Putin.

""On any given day, he can formulate his declaration of victory, withdraw his forces and focus on managing the domestic confusion and turmoil that would arise — alongside unquestionable relief and joy for countless Russian families.

""Analysts rightly note that such a course for Putin would entail serious, perhaps existential, risks and difficulties. His current course entails the same. Either way, they are difficulties he has earned. In the meantime, the Ukrainians will continue to defend their land, their families, their way of life.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124154708/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russians-who-want-to-leave-country-by-car-may-soon-have-to-make-online-reservation-12541713

Over the weekend, it was confirmed that Conservative party chairman Nadhim Zahawi had settled a tax matter with HMRC.

Sky News wanted to put this number into perspective.

According to a report from the think tank TaxPayers' Alliance, this means that Mr Zahawi paid the taxman the average lifetime tax contributions of four households in order to settle the matter.

The TPA report suggested that an average household pays £1,101,255 over the course of a lifetime, including 40 years working and 15 years retired.

Scott Hammond, deputy chief executive of SaxaVord Spaceport in Shetland, told Sky News they hope the site will host multiple launches in the months ahead.

It comes after an orbital launch attempt from Newquay this month ended in failure.

Spaceport Cornwall's highly anticipated space mission on 9 January, which involved a LauncherOne rocket being taken skyward under the wing of a former Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747, fell short in its quest to deploy satellites into orbit.

Bosses at SaxaVord are hoping their site can finish the job - but unlike Newquay, Unst is built to host NASA-style vertical launches that offer it the chance to make history twice.

""To watch a rocket launch is going to be a completely different experience,"" Mr Hammond said.

""It's quite awe-inspiring when you see these happen.

""People will be really stunned by it, and to think it's happening from the UK will hopefully be really uplifting.""

The site's inaugural launch could happen in August.

If successful, it would involve a German HyImpulse Technologies suborbital rocket - which does not reach space - perform the first vertical blast-off ever from UK soil.

Following that, an orbital rocket launch by another German firm, Rocket Factory Augsburg, will aim to go one better than the Cornwall mission by reaching space and deploying satellites.

It will begin testing in the summer ahead of a launch in the autumn, potentially as soon as October.

An American company, ABL Space Systems, will also launch a mission this year called Pathfinder from the SaxaVord site, supported by funding from the UK Space Agency.

""Our ethos is to operate a spaceport much like an airport,"" Mr Hammond said.

While Cornwall's mission did not go to plan, it will always be in the history books for having received the UK's first spaceport licence.

SaxaVord hopes the Civil Aviation Authority will approve its application by the summer.

'The space industry is exploding'

SaxaVord could host 30 launches a year from its three launchpads once online, according to Mr Hammond.

Its location on Unst, the UK's northernmost inhabited island, is seen as ideal because of its clear airspace.

Future launches are also all but assured from Cornwall, and another spaceport is on the way in Sutherland, built and managed by Scottish rocket maker Orbex, which is also hoping to host launches in 2023.

Cornwall, Sutherland and SaxaVord are three of seven spaceports coming online across the UK - with the aim of together launching 100,000 satellites by 2030.

Only California builds more satellites than the UK, which wants to become a major European launch hub.

""The industry is exploding,"" Mr Hammond said.

""We are a data hungry society and satellites give you data, or they enable you to get data.

""Do you see us having less computers, less internet, less mobile phones? I suspect not - and satellites are a fundamental part of what you could call this third industrial revolution.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124160333/http://news.sky.com/story/uks-race-to-space-could-take-off-this-summer-12794294
384;Zara Aleena murder: Delays meant probation staff had only nine days to assess killer before his release from prison;Tuesday 24 January 2023 15:29, UK;[];[];['staff', 'zara', 'prison', 'delays', 'days', 'meant', 'release', 'mcsweeney', 'report', 'case', 'murder', 'probation', 'killer', 'officer', 'recall'];"""Significant"" delays meant probation staff who assessed Jordan McSweeney before his release from prison were only allocated the case nine days before he was let out into the community, a watchdog has found.

McSweeney, 29, attacked and killed law graduate Zara Aleena in Ilford, east London, on 26 June last year, just nine days after being released from HMP Belmarsh.

A damning report by the UK's Chief Inspector of Probation has found there was a catalogue of errors in the Probation Service's handling of McSweeney's release, which meant he was not treated as a high-risk offender and was ""free"" to commit this ""most heinous crime"".

Among the issues flagged in the report was a two-month delay in formally assigning the case, meaning probation officers had less than a fortnight to carry out important assessments and planning for his release.

When the case was assigned, it was handed over with a ""lack of detail"" to a newly-qualified probation officer, the report found.

It also found delays in signing off on a recall to prison issued for McSweeney following his release.

Though the report does not suggest that without the delays Ms Aleena's murder could have been prevented, it does say that the chance to have located and arrested McSweeney ""would have been maximised"".

In December, McSweeney was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 38 years after pleading guilty to the law student's murder.

A life-long offender

McSweeney was well known to the probation service, with a long history of offending stretching back to 2005 when he was reprimanded for two assaults at the age of 12.

After being punished for burglaries in his teenage years, he was given his first conviction for violence in 2010 when he was convicted of causing actual bodily harm (ABH).

McSweeney, whose offending was, according to the report, mostly motivated by his need for money to feed his addiction to drugs and alcohol, was later handed a series of burglary-related prison sentences,

After being granted parole in 2020 for a burglary offence, he was charged with carrying a weapon, criminal damage, and racially aggravated public order offences while in prison.

It was for these offences that McSweeney would be jailed and eventually released in the days before his murder of Ms Aleena.

Delays in assigning his case

McSweeney was out on licence - serving the remainder of a sentence in the community whilst sticking to certain conditions - in November 2020 when he was charged with the prison offences.

He remained out of prison until February 2021 when he was arrested on suspicion of robbery and causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) - charges he was later found not guilty of.

However, as a result of the new charges, he was recalled to prison to serve the remainder of his 2020 burglary sentence.

The sentence expired in October 2021, after which McSweeney was held in custody until April 2022, when he was sentenced to 16 months for the prison-related offences.

His time spent on remand was taken off his total sentence, giving him a release date of 17 June 2022.

Owing to the short time until release, McSweeney should have then been assigned a community offender manager, the UK's Chief Inspector of Probation found.

However, according to his report, this did not happen until June, leading to a two-month delay in the formal allocation to a named probation officer.

During that time, his report said, there was ""limited contact"" between the prison offender manager and the community probation officer, due to ""excessive workload and the limited time available"".

The case was formally assigned to the probation officer on 9 June 2022, nine days before his release, giving limited time for pre-release planning and assessment.

It was handed to a newly-qualified probation officer, who was assigned McSweeney because they had previously worked on his case.

McSweeney's release from prison was signed off with conditions for drug testing and a requirement to attend a well-being service.

However, the official did not opt for use of an electronic GPS monitoring tag, something which the report said could have been applied.

McSweeney is released

According to the report, in February 2022 McSweeney's mother had asked probation staff not to release her son to her address because she was concerned he would reunite with associates in the area who could lead him back into a life of crime.

Despite the probation service having no clarity of where he would stay after his release, McSweeney left HMP Belmarsh on 17 June 2022. He failed to attend the well-being service later that day.

His mother confirmed to probation that he was drunk and at her address. Probation staff issued a warning to McSweeney for non-compliance with his licence conditions.

According to the report, an instant recall to prison could have been considered at this stage, but it was ""usual"" for staff to offer offenders deemed ""medium risk"", as McSweeney was, further opportunities to attend.

""A term used was that cases such as McSweeney would usually 'rock up' at some stage,"" the UK's Chief Inspector of Probation found.

""This was indicative of using a generic approach ... rather than assessing a case on its own merits,"" his report added.

McSweeney did not attend two further meetings and, by 22 June, had not been seen by his mother or the police in five days.

According to the report, McSweeney's probation officer then initiated recall proceedings. However, a senior staff member did not countersign the request for 48 hours - despite there being a 24-hour target time.

The recall notice was issued at 4.10pm on 24 June, less than 48 hours before McSweeney murdered Ms Aleena in the early hours of 26 June.

The report said: ""National data on recalls shows that the median time between licence revocation and a return to prison custody is three days.

""Had a recall been initiated following the missed appointment on 20 June, or completed within the specified timescale on 23 June, the time for police to locate and arrest McSweeney would have been maximised.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124160333/http://news.sky.com/story/zara-aleena-murder-delays-meant-probation-staff-had-only-nine-days-to-assess-killer-before-his-release-from-prison-12794150

Katie MacKay shared a clip of the damaged A850 at Skeabost, stating that ""enough is enough"".

Speaking to Sky News, Ms MacKay claimed that the roads around Skye have been bad for a year and have now deteriorated further due to the recent winter weather.

She said: ""We normally have a mild climate but there was a cold snap before Christmas which annihilated roads that were already annihilated.""

The solicitor, who lives and works in Skye, travels around 20 miles a day ""over some very broken roads"" from the west of the isle to Portree.

She explained that the loose stones and pebbles are a hazard to drivers and their vehicles.

Ms MacKay said: ""That's a main road, a busy route. The condition is now dangerous.""

After posting the video online on Twitter and Facebook, several others chimed in over the crater-ridden road.

One Twitter user said: ""That's horrendous! A real tyre, wheel, and suspension buster!""

Another added: ""This road is an accident waiting to happen, so dangerous.""

Anna Kate Barton stated: ""As a popular tourist destination and for Skye's locals virtually all of whom live rurally, things really need to be better than this!""

Chef Calum Montgomery, the owner of Edinbane Lodge, told Sky News: ""It is disappointing to see such lack of funding and urgency to repair and maintain our main roads on the island which have taken on much more traffic since the like of picturesque social media images have attracted so many more visitors to the island over the past decade.""

Image: Sunrise over the Old Man of Storr

Ms MacKay agreed that tourism has boomed since 2015 thanks to Instagram-worthy beauty spots like the Old Man of Storr and the Fairy Pools.

The pandemic also reportedly led to a surge in visitors when international travel was restricted.

Ms MacKay said she had reported the damaged roads to the council but felt she was ""banging her head against a wall"".

She said she had been left ""disappointed"", adding: ""That's why I uploaded the video.""

The move did the trick.

'Several key stretches of main road are in a very poor state'

In response, Highland Council has since confirmed that teams have been mobilised to start resurfacing works on Wednesday on the A863 Sligachan - Dunvegan at Crossal, A850 Borve - Dunvegan at Skeabost, and A855 Portree - Staffin north of Torvaig Junction.

Sixth-tier outfit Darvel triumphed against the odds thanks to a deflected strike by Jordan Kirkpatrick in the first-half of the game on Monday night and the determination of goalkeeper, Chris Truesdale, to keep Aberdeen out in the second 45 minutes.

Following the final whistle at Recreation Park in Ayrshire, partying could be heard into the night.

Mother and daughter duo Helen and Ainslie Ballantyne, who run the local roll shop, told Sky News it was a ""historic moment"" for Darvel.

Helen added: ""It's got us on the map, that's for sure. It's just brought the full community together.

""We've all worked so hard to pull everything together and everybody is just absolutely buzzing.""

After the game, Helen said it was ""total elation"", noting: ""You could hear the screams, the whistles, the roaring all over the town last night. The atmosphere was just absolutely amazing.

""I actually had goosebumps. I've never felt this way ever about any football, but this moment last night just made me feel overwhelmed and proud to live in Darvel.""

The town is home to less than 4,000 people with some of its part-time football players earning as little as £70 per week.

Ainslie said the win was ""amazing"", adding: ""We've had so many people in this morning that have just been on top of the world - very hungover, a few sore heads, but just so happy.""

Manager Michael Kennedy, who visited the local primary school following the win, told Sky News it was an ""unbelievable occasion"" for the whole town and the club in general.

He added: ""When we started this journey a few years ago, nobody [could have] foreseen what we achieved last night - it's unthinkable, unimaginable.

""I don't even think it's set in yet to be honest with you. It will probably take a couple of days for it all to become a bit real.""

Mr Kennedy said the club wouldn't survive without support from the local community and said around 2,500 locals snapped up tickets for the match.

He said it was a ""remarkable achievement"" for ""everyone connected"" with the team.

The records ""appear to be a small number of documents bearing classified markings that were inadvertently boxed and transported to the personal home of the former vice president at the end of the last administration,"" Mr Pence's lawyer, Greg Jacob, told the National Archives in a letter last week.

He said Mr Pence ""was unaware of the existence of sensitive or classified documents at his personal residence"" and he ""understands the high importance of protecting sensitive and classified information and stands ready and willing to cooperate fully with the National Archives and any appropriate inquiry.""

Mr Jacob said Mr Pence immediately secured the documents in a locked safe.

FBI agents went to Mr Pence's home to collect the classified documents, his representative said in a separate letter.

When Mr Pence was asked in August whether he had taken any classified information with him when he left office, he told the Associated Press: ""No, not to my knowledge.""

In an interview with Fox Business in January, he described a ""very formal process"" used by his office to handle classified information, as well as steps taken by his lawyers to ensure none were taken with him.

""Before we left the White House, the attorneys on my staff went through all the documents at both the White House and our offices there and at the vice president's residence to ensure that any documents that needed to be turned over to the National Archives, including classified documents, were turned over,"" he said.

""So we went through a very careful process in that regard.""

Classified documents found at Trump and Biden's homes

It comes after top secret documents were uncovered during an FBI search of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.

The Justice Department said around 300 documents marked classified, including at the top-secret level, were taken from the estate.

Officials are working to determine whether Mr Trump or anyone else should be charged with illegal possession of those records or with trying to obstruct the months-long criminal investigation.

Classified documents were also found at US President Joe Biden's home in Delaware, relating to his time as vice president in the Obama administration.

Republicans have sought to compare the investigations into Mr Biden's and Mr Trump's handling of classified documents.

Sometimes, if there's been a heavy intake of unexpected emergencies, then planned surgeries are postponed.

However, 10 minutes into the meeting last Friday, theatre manager Ahmad Turab was able to call up to the cancer ward on the seventh floor to say all the planned procedures can go ahead.

It was a relief for Peter Gibson, 71. It meant he would be getting his tumour out that morning.

Mr Gibson, a Christian pastor, is hugely grateful for his care at the Royal Free Hospital, but thinks the government is playing games when it comes to negotiating with medics over pay and conditions.

""My care has been exemplary,"" he says.

""I've got lots of friends who are in the NHS. I think they deserve a lot more than they are asking for.

""And the people who hold the purse strings in the government, I think they're just playing God. Probably trying to break the NHS, so we all go private.""

Mr Gibson's operation goes well. The Royal Free Hospital has the largest neuroendocrine tumour service in the UK, and does the most operations in the country on complex tumours in the gut.

Doctors at the hospital say they kept cancer surgery going during the peaks of the pandemic, but the virus has left a legacy.

Reza Mirnezami, the consultant colorectal and endocrine tumour surgeon who operated on Mr Gibson, told Sky News: ""The footprint that COVID's left on the work we're doing now, which is still real, and pretty immense.

""We've got a huge backlog, primarily of patients waiting to have surgery for benign conditions.""

He adds: ""During COVID, people were not going to their GPs enough to investigate things like bleeding from the back passage or unusual gastrointestinal symptoms.

""And there was a delay to presentation, and we know, especially with cancer, getting to things early gives you the best chance of having treatment to cure it. So, unfortunately, we have seen a lot of patients presenting with very advanced disease.""

Ambulance workers strike for third time in five weeks as pay and staffing dispute rumbles on

Ministers accused of having 'sinister reason' for 'not doing a deal' with nurses

Research from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) shows that nationwide 1,000 more people are dying every week than expected.

Dr Adrian Boyle, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM), told a parliament committee on Tuesday: ""We have the second lowest number of beds in the OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development].

""We run our hospitals far, far too full with far too high occupancy levels. They are hideously high.

""[Investment] is a step in the right direction, but it's going to take a long time to recover from. Things have been going wrong for quite some time and have come to a head over December.""

The excess death rates have left questions about the impact of budget cuts and COVID on hospital care - in England and Wales there were more than 17,000 registered deaths in the week to 13 January.

That's about 20% more weekly deaths compared to the five-year average, and the highest figure in nearly two years.

It's not just delays in operations, but pressures on emergency care, ambulances, and A&E; waiting times.

In the Royal Free Hospital emergency department, Charlotte Kramer, a senior staff nurse, runs through the patient list. I ask if she minds telling me what the longest waiting times are today.

""There's no point you being here unless you show people what it's really like,"" she says. ""So, the longest waiting time we have in A&E; [today] is 27 hours for an 84-year-old gentleman who is waiting for a medical bed.""

There are plenty of others waiting for long hours, and it tends to be those needing geriatric care, where there's a bottleneck due to slow discharges, often because of the lack of care in the community.

It means A&E; nurses are being diverted to care for elderly patients while they wait for a bed on the ward, and that more patients pile up at the emergency department entrance.

Despite creating some new bed areas in corridors, sometimes there still isn't space.

Emergency medicine registrar Anushka Saroop says: ""In the last couple of months, we were seeing patients at the back of the ambulances that have their blood test done. The ambulance crew have been really helpful taking the patients to have their scans, but we'll have to bring them back on to the ambulance.""

She adds: ""I think one of the things that we're focused on is we have no beds. There are a lot of delayed discharges from the hospital - things like social care - getting those things in place would allow us to move ahead a bit better.

""More staff are always welcome, they are much needed. Better pay and conditions for doctors, nurses, domestics, everyone across the board has been working really hard, really diligently - we've been really flexible to not compromise patient care, but you can only work at that intensity without becoming exhausted.""

Asked if she thinks the problems in A&E; are contributing to higher death rates, Dr Saroop says: ""It's a high risk because we're seeing higher volumes of patients who are more frail, they're more unwell, they're sicker. And we're doing that with the same amount of resources and the same amount of staff.

""The clinician-to-patient ratio has widened greatly. So, there's the potential for that happening.""

The hospital doubled its A&E; department size during the pandemic - taking over a physiotherapy space - but there has since been no let-up, and they have often more than filled the overspill waiting room, with sometimes up to 50 patients arriving in a single hour.

Strike action is another strain on the service but, wheeling an 89-year-old patient into the emergency department, ambulance driver Tim Wilmott says it's necessary: ""The NHS can be a bottomless pit of money. But more money would be great.

""I think striking is the only way that us and the nurses and other sectors of society have got to make our feelings known to the government.""

The people, problems and pressure keep piling through the hospital doors.

390;Eurostar: Hundreds of seats on trains left unsold to avoid long queues at stations;Tuesday 24 January 2023 18:02, UK;[];['eurostar'];['runs', 'delay', 'stations', 'trains', 'seats', 'avoid', 'eurostar', 'london', 'left', 'unsold', 'uk', 'long', 'services', 'hundreds', 'paris', 'queues', 'st'];"Hundreds of seats on Eurostar trains from London to the continent are deliberately being left unsold so long queues don't build up at stations, the company has admitted.

A cut in the number of border officials means it takes nearly 30% longer to process passengers leaving St Pancras International than before Brexit and the pandemic.

Also contributing to the delay is the post-Brexit requirement to stamp UK passports for outbound travel.

Seat numbers are now being capped to prevent bottlenecks at stations.

The first daily services connecting London to Paris and Brussels can take up to 900 passengers.

But 350 of those seats are intentionally not being sold.

Eurostar runs the only high-speed trains that directly link the UK to France and Belgium via the Channel Tunnel.

As well as London's St Pancras, it also runs UK services from Ebbsfleet and Ashford, both in Kent.

Eurostar chief executive Gwendoline Cazenave said it was vital that the first trains to leave are on time to avoid a knock-on problem.

""If you delay the first train, then you delay the second and then it's a very bad customer experience,"" she said.

""Our customers say it's awful.""

Downing Street hopes to put in place ""robust"" measures to determine the age of asylum seekers arriving in the UK following the conviction of an Afghan man.

Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai was found guilty on Monday of the murder of 21-year-old Thomas Roberts outside a Subway in Bournemouth, Dorset, in 2022.



The defendant, who arrived in the UK in December 2019, told authorities at the time that he was 16 - but it was determined at Salisbury Crown Court that his true age is 21.

Downing Street described the case as ""shocking"" and said it underlines the need for ""robust age measurement measures"".

A report by the Age Estimation Science Advisory Committee said existing age checks - which rely on interviews with social workers - could be supported by ""biological age assessment"".

That could include X-rays or MRI scans to determine the development of teeth and bones, although campaigners have questioned whether such methods are either ethical or reliable.

The prime minister's official spokesman said scientific checks are already in place in other countries and that the UK is now looking to follow suit.

""We are considering the report of the Age Estimation Science Advisory Committee on scientific methods to assess the age of asylum seekers - and resolve the age disputes - which are indeed in place in countries like Norway, Denmark and Sweden,"" the spokesman said.

It feels like we're driving through a dystopian movie set. It's dawn and the roads are shrouded in mist.

Suddenly, we grind to a halt. The end of a long metal pole creeps past our window. As it inches closer, I realise it's attached to a tank.

Minutes later, a fleet of model navy ships decked in bright green and yellow bulbs shimmer out of the shadows. They look almost festive.

Then comes the ominous march of missiles.

Our destination is growing closer and we're not alone. A cavalcade of buses roll in, packed with performers in vibrant regional dress. Their hair and make-up is immaculate.

A few are still snoozing on arrival. It is 4am and they've been compliantly rehearsing at this early hour for weeks.

We're in Myanmar - a country that's been largely off limits to Western journalists since the military seized power in a coup nearly two years ago.

Some call it the Land of the Shadows - a nation caught between light and darkness. The abiding impression from our first day is that it embodies that paradox - hugely colourful and deeply intimidating.

Our journey starts at the 75th Anniversary of Myanmar's independence from Britain.

The military government who has planned it all is looking to show the world - and convince their own country - that the regime is stable. It's a hard sell.

The junta is accused of war crimes and genocide. It's been condemned by the UN, sanctioned and the economy is precarious to say the least.

But the man at the top, self-declared caretaker Prime Minister Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, wants to deliver a day of national pride.

He arrives at the event alongside an army of soldiers on horseback, their hooves clattering alongside an unnerving discordant soundtrack.

The commander of the Tatmadaw, who is accused of strangling a democracy and unparalleled brutality, uses his speech to tout free and fair elections while thanking those countries who have kept him close - most notably China and Russia.

Hove MP Peter Kyle said officers in his constituency pursued a car that had picked up two children from outside the Home Office approved accommodation after concerns about what was happening.

It comes after the government confirmed that about 200 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children remain missing after initially being housed in hotels since July 2022.

There have been reports that dozens of youngsters have been abducted from hotels in the Brighton and Hove area.

Speaking about one of the hotels used to house child asylum seekers in his constituency, Mr Kyle told the Commons: ""Just last year, Sussex Police pursued a car that had collected two children from outside this hotel.

""When they managed to get the car to safety, they released two child migrants and they arrested one of the members who was driving it - who was a gang leader who was there to coerce the children into crime.""

Responding to an urgent question, immigration minister Robert Jenrick told the Commons today that out of 4,600 unaccompanied children who have entered the UK since July 2021, 440 have gone missing at some point, with only half of them returning.

He told the House: ""Two hundred children remain missing, 13 of whom are under 16 years old, and only one is female.

""When any child goes missing, a multi-agency missing persons protocol is mobilised alongside the police and relevant local authority to establish their whereabouts and to ensure that they are safe.

""Many of those who have gone missing are subsequently traced and located. Of the unaccompanied asylum-seeking children still missing, 88% are Albanian nationals; the remaining 12% are from Afghanistan, Egypt, India Vietnam, Pakistan and Turkey.""

Children 'being dumped by Home Office'

Mr Kyle, a Labour MP, said he was aware of 76 children who had vanished from one hotel.

It comes after an investigation by The Observer at the weekend reported that dozens of unaccompanied child migrants had been kidnapped by criminal gangs in Brighton.

Mr Kyle said: ""The uncomfortable truth for us is if one child who was related to one of us in this room went missing, the world would stop.

""But in the community I represent, a child has gone missing, then five went missing, then a dozen went missing, then 50 went missing and currently today 76 are missing - and nothing is happening.""

Mr Jenrick said he had not seen evidence of children being kidnapped but the allegations were ""extremely serious"" and he would ""continue to make inquiries"".

Image: Caroline Lucas called the numbers of missing children 'sickening'

In the meantime, he said he would like Mr Kyle to join him on a visit to the hotel so they could review the situation.

Brighton MP Caroline Lucas accused the Home Office of ""dumping vulnerable children"" in hotels then shirking in their responsibility to look after them.

'Frankly, it is sickening'

She asked how many of the missing children have been ""kidnapped, trafficked, put into forced labour"" and said it was ""not clear"" whether the Home Office was ""prepared to take legal as well as practical responsibility"" to find them.

""I was told before Christmas that government lawyers were deliberating over their ultimate legal responsibility. We need to know the outcome today,"" she said.

Ms Lucas called for a special operation to find the missing children adding: ""This feels like the plight of girls in Rotherham who were treated like they didn't matter. And frankly, it is sickening.""

She added: ""We are not asking him to detain children. We are asking the Home Office to apply some basic safeguarding so we can keep them safe"".

Mr Jenrick insisted cases of asylum-seeking children going missing from Home Office accommodation are treated in ""exactly the same way as any young person who goes missing"".

Yvette Cooper, Labour's spokesperson on immigration, accused the government of ""a total dereliction of duty that is putting children at risk"".

The children's commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza, said the reports of children disappearing from hotels ""have highlighted, once again, the vulnerability of these children, who are in limbo, with a concerted group of people determined to exploit them.""

She said in a letter to the Home Office: ""I am concerned for the safety of this group of children whose vulnerability is exacerbated by not speaking English, many of whom have no support network and are not aware of their rights.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124192708/http://news.sky.com/story/mp-describes-police-chase-after-asylum-seeking-children-collected-from-hotel-as-200-youngsters-confirmed-missing-12794293

Sky News understands that the Reds' and Red Devils' biggest fan representative groups will issue a rare joint statement to urge ministers to include a beefed-up test for club owners and directors in an imminent white paper.

The intervention by the Spirit of Shankly (SoS) and Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST) will underline the determination of English football's two most successful teams' fan-bases to secure greater influence of how their clubs are run.

It will be the most significant act of unity between them since the European Super League was abandoned by its six English participants nearly two years ago.

Draft legislation on football governance, which will include plans for a new independent regulator, is expected to be published next month.

It will come as the owners of Liverpool and Manchester United work with corporate financiers on processes which could trigger the emergence of new minority or controlling shareholders.

New York-listed Manchester United confirmed an exclusive Sky News report in November that it had hired bankers to explore a sale that could result in the Glazer family relinquishing control of the club.

More on Liverpool Fc Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group say they are open to offers, raising prospect of club being sold

Liverpool's owners, Fenway Sports Group, are also examining whether to sell their interest.

A number of sovereign wealth funds have been linked with both clubs, while Jim Ratcliffe, the Ineos petrochemicals tycoon, has publicly declared his interest in buying the Red Devils.

In their statement, to be issued on Wednesday, Joe Blott, SoS chairman, and Duncan Drasdo, MUST chief executive, will say: ""By common consent, our clubs are the biggest in English football and, with a combined worldwide fanbase of over 200m people, they are widely recognised global institutions - in fact perhaps two of the most well-known British institutions worldwide.

""That global profile will likely attract many potential bidders, including some whose primary motivations may not respect either the cultural heritage of our clubs or the values and interests of supporters.

""We think that should be a matter of importance to the government.

""Just as the government would not allow our most important cultural or heritage assets to fall into unfit or improper hands, it should not allow our football clubs to do so either.""

The two supporters' groups will say they welcome proposals for a new independent football regulator, while warning that ""there is a danger it will come too late for the country's two biggest and most successful clubs"".

""Manchester United and Liverpool fans are the most fierce rivals.

""If we can come together with common cause then we believe the government can work out a way to ensure its intended Independent Regulator for English Football (IREF) and stronger ownership rules can be introduced quickly enough to safeguard the future of our two clubs.""

The two supporters' groups will say they are particularly focused on the scope and content of a strengthened owners and directors test, the corporate governance framework within which they would be required to operate, and rules guaranteeing supporters ""significant input into how their clubs are run"".

The founder of Russia's Wagner mercenary group fighting in Ukraine has asked the Kremlin to ban negative media reports about his men.

Yevgeny Prigozhin has called for the criminal code to be amended to make ""discrediting"" his fighters punishable by up to five years in jail.

He made the request in a letter sent to Vycheslav Volodin, the chairman of the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament.

Mr Volodin, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, is already advocating amending the criminal code to allow the authorities to confiscate the property and assets of Russians living abroad who publicly insult Russia and its armed forces.

But now Mr Prigozhin, who has adopted a high public profile since the war in Ukraine began, has accused ""certain media, bloggers and Telegram channels"" of discrediting some of his men, including convicts he has recruited into Wagner's ranks, by presenting them as ""bad guys and criminals"".

The Wagner boss asked parliament to criminalise any actions or publications that discredited such individuals and to outlaw public disclosure of their criminal past.

""In essence, the people who are on the most dangerous parts of the frontline and who are risking their lives every day and dying for the Motherland are being portrayed as second-class people, stripping them of the right to atone for their guilt before society and consciously playing down their achievements,"" Mr Prigozhin wrote in the letter.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124192708/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-german-approval-for-poland-to-send-tanks-to-ukraine-to-come-this-week-as-us-poised-to-approve-m1-abrams-tanks-12541713

The 67-year-old Italian choreographer and dancer has replaced comedian David Walliams on the ITV talent show's judging panel, and will join Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon.

As auditions began on Tuesday, Tonioli said: ""Here we are, Britain's Got Talent. I am so excited.

""It's my first show, I have no idea what's going to happen, but I'm sure it's going to be brilliant.""

Walliams, who joined the show in 2012, apologised in November for making ""disrespectful comments"" about contestants during breaks in filming in January 2020.

The first round of auditions kicked off on Tuesday as the show returned to the London Palladium, with hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly pictured entering the venue alongside the show's creator, Cowell, 63, who was wearing a grey jumper and black aviator sunglasses.

Posting a picture of the Palladium, BGT's official Twitter page said: ""We're baaaack! And we're ready to find our next #BGT superstar! Could it be you? Auditions day 1, bring it on!""

Tonioli, who is a ballroom and Latin dancer, was a fan favourite on Strictly after joining the BBC One programme during its debut series in 2004.

It was announced last year he would be leaving the celebrity dancing competition after his travel commitments made it ""impossible"" to continue.

Madcap sci-fi Everything Everywhere All At Once leads the race with 11 nods - thanks to four nominations in the acting categories and making the cut for best picture - closely followed by dark comedy The Banshees Of Inisherin and German-language film All Quiet On The Western Front, with nine nods each.

You can see the full list of Oscar nominees here. Elsewhere, here are the main talking points from the 2023 Oscar nominations.

A big year for first-timers

Image: Bill Nighy in Living. Pic: Sony Pictures

In something of a coup, it was a particularly successful year for first-timers with 16 of the 20 actor nominations for those who had never been nominated before.

In fact, the best actor category was all newcomers (despite Bill Nighy being a spritely 73); all but two of the best actress nominees are first-time nominees (Cate Blanchett and Michelle Williams have both been nominated multiple times, and Blanchett has won twice), and in the supporting actor and actress categories only Angela Bassett and Judd Hirsch have made the list before.

US actor Brendan Fraser and Irish star Colin Farrell have already been pitted against each other in a ""Fraser vs Farrell"" showdown, with both men campaigning for a win in the best actor category.

And like Fraser, who's coming back into the spotlight after a spell in the shade, Everything Everywhere star Ke Huy Quan - who starred in The Goonies and India Jones And The Temple Of Doom as a child and now has his first Oscar nod for best supporting actor - is enjoying a surge of public goodwill.

Meanwhile, British character actress Andrea Riseborough's nod for little-known film To Leslie has caught the film world by surprise, after the movie gained a legion of A-List fans including Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet and Jennifer Aniston. Lest we forget, in Hollywood, it's all about who you know…

Sequels make history

It was a record-breaking year for sequels.

For the first time, the best picture category saw two sequels nominated - Top Gun: Maverick and Avatar: The Way of Water.

Only eight sequels have ever been nominated for best picture in Oscar history, and never before have two been chosen in the same year.

Those which have previously made the cut include follow-ups to The Godfather, The Lord of the Rings and Mad Max.

Popular films make an Oscars comeback

Image: Avatar: The Way Of Water. Pic: 20th Century Studios

A frequent complaint about the Oscars is that the films which get selected by critics and industry insiders aren't the movies we all love watching in real life.

However, this year, three big popular films have made it into the best picture category - Avatar: The Way Of Water, Top Gun: Maverick and Elvis.

Widely watched, they all performed well at the box office, with Avatar breaking box office records and taking more than $2bn (£1.6bn) worldwide, Top Gun taking $1.5bn (£1.2bn) and Elvis taking over $280mn (£230mn), making it the third highest-grossing music biopic since the 1970s.

So this year, when we finally roll around the star-studded ceremony in March, not only could we have seen the eventual best picture winner, we might even have enjoyed it.

Is streaming really the future?

Despite forecasts that streaming giants could crowd out traditional cinema releases, and last year's winner - Coda - coming from Apple TV+, this year's top category only had one streamer in the mix - Netflix's All Quiet On The Western Front.

All of the other best picture contenders were released in cinemas, although some have since become available on streaming platforms.

Despite Netflix putting plenty of campaigning heft into Glass Onion and Pinocchio, both movies scored just one nomination each.

In total, streaming services received about half the number of nominations they did a year ago, with Netflix, Apple and Amazon getting a total of 19 nominations, down from 37 last year, according to Deadline.

Death of the cinema, it seems, has been somewhat exaggerated - or at least postponed - with the lifting of pandemic restrictions helping fuel a return.

All male directors (yawn)

There are more men called Daniel in the best director nominations list than women, after female filmmakers were completely shut out of the category.

While directors Charlotte Wells (Aftersun), Sarah Polley (Women Talking) and Gina Prince-Bythewood (The Woman King) were all overlooked, it was six men (Steven Spielberg, Martin McDonagh, Todd Field, Ruben Ostlund, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) who made the cut.

So, one thing we know for sure is that despite women winning the category two years running (Chloe Zhao in 2021 for Nomadland and Jane Campion in 2022 for The Power Of The Dog) it will not be a woman taking home the gong this year.

A disappointing result in a category which until 2021 had only ever had one female winner in the Oscars' then 93-year-history (Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010). Not very impressive.

A great year for Irish stars...

Just as it played out with the BAFTA nominations, Irish stars are having a moment at this year's Oscars - with Culture Minister Catherine Martin hailing the success a ""testament to the talent here in Ireland"".

Colin Farrell and Paul Mescal are both up for best actor award, for The Banshees Of Inisherin and Aftersun respectively, while in the supporting categories, Farrell's co-stars Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon are all in the running, too.

In fact, Martin McDonagh's dark comedy The Banshees Of Inisherin, a story about dealing with a friendship that is falling apart, picked up nine nods in total - beaten only by sci-fi thriller Everything Everywhere All At Once.

Normal People's Mescal is nominated for the first time for his portrayal of young father Calum in Aftersun, which follows him and his daughter Sophie, played by newcomer Frankie Corio, on holiday in Turkey, with Celia Rowlson-Hall portraying an adult Sophie looking back at the trip 20 years on.

Elsewhere, The Quiet Girl has become the first Irish language feature film to be nominated for an Academy Award, shortlisted for best international feature film along with All Quiet On The Western Front, Argentina, 1985, Close and EO.

... but not so good for British actors

Only two of this year's acting nominees are British - Bill Nighy, for Living, and Andrea Riseborough, for To Leslie - the lowest number of British nominees in the categories in a decade.

Last year, five of the 20 nominees were British, and the year before that, the number stood at eight.

British stars who could have been in with a shot?

Olivia Colman and Eddie Redmayne, both previous Oscar winners who have been recognised throughout this awards season, missed out on nominations for their performances in Empire of Light and The Good Nurse respectively.

Having been nominated for a BAFTA for her performance in Good Luck To You, Leo Grande, Emma Thompson might also have been in with a chance.

Every year, there are some films and stars inevitably left out of the Oscars cut. Sadly, that's showbiz.

This year, notable absences once again raise questions about diversity; they include Till, a biographical film based on the true story of Mamie Till-Bradley, who pursued justice after the racist murder of her 14-year-old son Emmett Till in 1955 - for which star Danielle Deadwyler has been universally praised for her performance - and Gina Prince-Bythewood's The Woman King, which at one time had many predicting a best actress nod for Viola Davis.

And while Angela Bassett is nominated in the supporting actress category - marking Marvel's first acting nomination - Black Panther: Wakanda Forever missed out on a nod for best film, despite a strong showing at the box office and critical acclaim.

Damien Chazelle's Babylon, an ode to the wild days of silent film, did receive three nominations - for costume, music and production design - but didn't make the cut in the acting or directing categories, and missed out on best film.

The film, which had a budget of $80m (about £65m), has made less than $30m (about £24m) at the box office so far and divided critics, so perhaps this one isn't too surprising.

The Brenaissance

Brendan Fraser's Oscar nomination comes after a flurry of other nods and awards for his performance in The Whale, marking a comeback in his first lead role in a major film for 12 years.

In the film, Fraser, who starred in The Mummy and George Of The Jungle, plays an obese man trying to reconnect with his daughter, and has received standing ovations at film festivals for his emotive performance.

The star said he was ""overjoyed"" to be nominated and that playing his character, Charlie, had ""profoundly changed my life"".

""I wouldn't have this nomination without [director] Darren Aronofsky, [writer] Samuel D Hunter, [producers] A24 and the extraordinary cast and crew who gave me the gift of Charlie,"" he said.

""A gift I certainly didn't see coming, but it's one that has profoundly changed my life. Thank you!""

Music

It's not just the A-list film stars you need to watch out for at this year's Oscars ceremony, as musicians including Rihanna and Lady Gaga could be there on the red carpet, too.

Who could forget Lady Gaga's rendition of Shallow alongside her A Star Is Born co-star Bradley Cooper on Oscars night 2019, the performance that sparked a million romance rumours? More of this, please.

This year, she's nominated in the best song category for Hold My Hand, from Top Gun: Maverick, while Rihanna is in the running for Lift Me Up from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.

So could this be a year for two pop powerhouses to shine? It could even have been three, but Taylor Swift's Carolina, from Where The Crawdads Sing, didn't make the cut.

Naatu Naatu from RRR, This Is A Life from Everything Everywhere All At Once, and Applause from Tell It Like A Woman are also nominated.

And proof that even Oscar-winning stars love a ""Dick"" joke

Image: My Year Of Dicks. Pic: Cat's Pyjamas / Wonder Killer

The highlight of the nomination announcements - which, let's face it, can often be a dull affair - was Oscar-winning actor and producer Riz Ahmed and M3GAN star Allison Williams talking about Dick.

My Year Of Dicks to be precise, a psychedelic 25-minute long film about an American teenager trying to have sex for the first time in the early 1990s, created by Pamela Ribon and directed by Sara Gunnarsdottir.

The normally composed Ahmed had to take a long breath after saying the film's X-rated title, with the audience laughing as he did so.

Co-host Williams - used to sexy scenes from her time in Girls - could also be seen giggling.

Cue numerous Google searches for the previously little-known short film across the world - which is very much NSFW (not safe for work).

Barry Martin, 38, was one of five firefighters who suffered injuries tackling the flames at the former department store on Monday.

Two were treated for smoke inhalation and two for burns.

Four have since been discharged, but Mr Martin, from Fife, remains in a critical condition at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.

A police officer also required treatment for smoke inhalation and was later released.

The investigation into the cause of the fire is ongoing.

Image: Firefighters were alerted to the blaze on Monday morning

Ross Haggart, interim chief officer with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS), said: ""This was undoubtedly a serious and complex fire.

""Our thoughts are very much with Barry and his family, and indeed with all of our colleagues who were injured in responding to this incident.

""Barry is a firefighter based in Edinburgh and we ask that everyone please respect his family's privacy at this time.

""We continue to provide all possible support to our colleagues and their families, as well as all staff involved.

""We are liaising with appropriate partners to ensure a full and thorough investigation is undertaken into this incident.""

The alarm was raised in the city's Rose Street shortly before 11.30am.

On arrival, firefighters found the iconic building ""well alight"".

At its height, 22 appliances and other specialist resources were sent to tackle the flames.

SFRS said more than 100 firefighters worked in ""difficult conditions"" to bring the fire under control.

Pictures and video taken at the scene showed smoke billowing from the category A-listed building.

Emergency crews remain at the scene with a single appliance to monitor the building for any potential ""hotspots"".

Police Scotland confirmed the east end of Rose Street is currently closed between South St David Street and Rose Street North Lane.

Two nearby business premises on Rose Street also remain closed.

The building, which Jenners moved into in 1895, is one of the best known in the Scottish capital.

The closure of the store, which was then controlled by Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, was announced in 2021.

Renovations have been ongoing to transform it into a hotel, supported by a firm owned by fashion billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124200228/http://news.sky.com/story/firefighter-critically-injured-in-jenners-building-fire-in-edinburgh-named-as-barry-martin-12794414

West Midlands Police told councillors in evidence today that the Birmingham club's ongoing operation posed ""terrifying risks"" to patrons, amid ""blatant"" and widespread drug use and ""inadequate"" security measures, which had also allowed a knife to enter the venue.

West Midlands Police previously said there had been ""serious management failings"" at the Crane venue.

Officers responded to the fatal stabbing of Mr Fisher, 23, in Digbeth on Boxing Day.

The club's licence had been suspended for 28 days after an interim meeting in December, but a Birmingham City Council licencing committee ordered the licence to be revoked today after an application by the police force.

The council also continued the existing suspension first handed down on 30 December 2022, meaning the club cannot reopen while any appeal against the decision by its operator and licence-holder Digital Arts Media Ltd is considered.

A previous police report documented how a knife alleged to have been used in the attack on Mr Fisher was found on the dancefloor of the venue.

The report described how officers found a ""scene of chaos"" and ""evidence of drug use"", while security and club staff were ""oblivious"" and ""started to clean up the dancefloor"" while CPR was still being performed on Mr Fisher.

In a verbal summary of police evidence to the committee, Gary Grant, a barrister representing the force, said there was an ""inadequate search regime"" which not only allowed a knife inside the club but also drugs, with ""blatant"" use of illicit substances leading to three people needing treatment for an ""overdose of one drug or another"".

One female patient who was carried out to an ambulance was said to be ""dribbling... and barely breathing"" before she was taken to hospital.

Mr Grant said: ""Within just over three months, this venue is here facing a summary review, triggered by an individual being murdered inside the club.

""That, in itself, gives rise to rather terrifying risks involved in the operation of this venue.

""On Boxing Day, Cody Fisher was tragically killed inside the venue and in addition, when the police investigated, they discovered what can only be described as blatant and widespread drug use being unchallenged inside the premises.""

He said there was also evidence of use and supply of nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, and ""hundreds of discarded drug bags, containing white powder"" were found on the dance floor.

""The licence-holder, we say, failed to uphold the highest standards of management operation of this venue,"" said Mr Grant.

Three men aged between 18 and 22 have been charged with Mr Fisher's murder.

Hazrat Wali, 18, died from a 10cm deep wound in Craneford Way Playing Fields in Twickenham, southwest London, on 12 October 2021.

The 17-year-old boy had appeared at a magistrates' court on the morning of the killing to plead guilty to being caught with a knife two months before. The judge gave him a youth rehabilitation order.

In his murder trial, he claimed he hadn't intended to cause Mr Wali, a student and aspiring cricketer, serious harm.

On Tuesday, an Old Bailey jury found him innocent of murder but guilty of the lesser alternative charge of manslaughter.

The court heard the victim had been sitting with a female friend on the day he died, when the defendant and five other teenagers approached them.

Prosecutors said a girl in the group said they ""looked nice together"" before the killer stared swearing at him.

Mr Wali stood up and approached him, and the defendant pushed him in the chest, challenging him to ""come at me then"".

Jurors were told Mr Wali rang a male friend for help, but the 17-year-old pulled out a 20cm black knife.

Mr Wali told his female friend to step away and as the pushing continued he was stabbed in the right side.

Image: The stabbing happened on playing fields. Pic: Google

He grabbed the defendant's jacket, asking: ""Why did you stab me?"" before picking up a fallen branch and collapsing as players from a school rugby match looked on.

The jury heard that a teacher gave first aid and emergency services were called, but Mr Wali died about an hour later.

The defendant told the court he had produced the knife as they were ""pushing each other"" and he wanted to be left alone.

He said he was ""scared"" when Mr Wali called his male friend for ""back-up"" and thought he might also have been carrying a knife.

At the time of the killing, he also claimed to have carried a knife because he didn't feel safe on the streets and after incidents in which he, a cousin and a friend were attacked.

He also described being involved in county lines drug dealing after being pressured by older boys in 2020 - who he claimed had threatened him.

The teenager, who can't be named because he's under 18, was remanded into youth detention and will be sentenced on 10 March.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124204730/http://news.sky.com/story/teenager-guilty-of-manslaughter-for-stabbing-afghan-refugee-in-twickenham-park-12794433

Isla Bryson attacked the victims before she transitioned to female and when she was known as Adam Graham.

A trial at the High Court in Glasgow heard Bryson raped one woman in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, in 2016, and another in Drumchapel, Glasgow, in 2019.

She met both her victims online, with prosecutors saying she ""preyed"" on vulnerable women.

Bryson, of Clydebank, denied the charges, telling the court she ""would never hurt another human being"". However, a jury found her guilty of both rape charges.

Addressing Bryson, 31, in the dock on Tuesday, judge Lord Scott said: ""You have been convicted by the jury of two extremely serious charges; those being charges of rape.""

He told her the crimes were ""considerable"" and that ""a significant sentence is inevitable"".

Bryson's bail was revoked and she has been remanded in custody until 28 February to allow Lord Scott to gather ""as much information as possible"" on her before deciding her sentencing.

The court heard Bryson was going through the breakdown of an unhappy, brief marriage when she went to stay with her first victim at the victim's mother's house in Clydebank in 2016.

On the night of the rape, Bryson was said to have locked the victim's bedroom door which was ""unusual"".

Giving evidence, the 30-year-old victim said: ""All I said was 'no' over and over and over again.

""At the time I was so scared. Sick to the stomach. I just didn't know what was going on.""

She said Bryson later threatened her family with harm if she told anyone.

The second victim told the court Bryson continued to have sex with her after she said stop.

Image: Bryson claimed both women consented to having sex

The 34-year-old told the court: ""I said to stop but he (Bryson) just kept on going, and that's when I just closed my eyes and I am doing what he wanted to do.""

In her own evidence, Bryson claimed both women consented to having sex.

She said she knew she was transgender at the age of four but did not make the decision to transition until she was 29. She is currently taking hormones and seeking surgery to complete gender reassignment.

She said in 2016 she was ""struggling with my sexuality and having issues emotionally"".

The court heard Bryson has three ""minor"" convictions on her record, but none of these required a prison sentence.

Chris Parry didn't know much about Ukraine before Russia invaded in February last year, but as soon as he saw news of the invasion he knew he had to go to help.

He spent months going into recently liberated villages on some of the most dangerous parts of the frontline where he rescued dozens, perhaps hundreds, of civilians.

Confirmation of his death on Tuesday comes after he and fellow Briton Andrew Bagshaw went missing on Friday after setting out for the embattled city of Soledar.

Originally from Cornwall, 28-year-old Mr Parry was living in Cheltenham and working as a running coach before the war.

He flew out to Poland and then crossed the border into Ukraine on 5 March.

It wasn't long before he had loaded up a van with supplies and set out to Kharkiv with a few others, taking back roads and on the lookout for the Russian soldiers that could be anywhere.

""It was a ghost town,"" he told Sky News in November.

""We were driving on the main highway into Kharkiv from the south and I remember passing one tank on the back of a lorry in blizzard-like conditions.

""And there was no one else on the road - and this is like the M5 equivalent so it was very, very peculiar.

""My companions were like 'yeah this is getting a bit scary now'.""

'I almost crashed on first trip to Kharkiv'

He said this first experience of the real war was ""eye-opening"".

He told Sky News in November: ""I look back on it very fondly because it was such a huge adventure.

""We broke down so much and we had so many issues because of the road conditions, we got stuck in the snow, I almost crashed.

""Lots of things happened, but we survived and that's the most important thing.""

It seems that wherever the battle was hottest, that was where Chris headed, determined to save as many people as he could.

He did evacuation runs out of Severodonetsk as Russian forces closed in, getting people out of the besieged city before it finally fell in June.

""That was getting shelled every minute or so,"" he said.

'We were being shelled by artillery... they were watching us'

The time eventually came when he made the difficult decision to tell his parents that he had been working in Ukraine for weeks, and not in Poland as they had thought.

He didn't want to worry them more than he needed to, but he also wanted to tell his story to spread the word about what was happening in Ukraine and how people could help.

In the days after he went missing, his family praised his compassion and care for others, and spoke of their pride in what he was doing.

Speaking to Sky News about a notable evacuation in a village east of Lyman in November, he described the scary moment they were fired upon by Russian forces.

""We were being shelled by artillery because they were watching us with a drone, and then waiting for us to park up and then they had a minute or two to try and hit us.

""We were getting hit by that quite a lot. So running to the car with people, trying to get in the car and then driving off as soon as possible was pretty high on the priority list.""

Kwasi Kwarteng, business secretary at the time, refused development consent for Aquind's new subsea electricity link between Portsmouth and Normandy in January.

But on Tuesday, Mrs Justice Lieven ruled Mr Kwarteng, who was briefly chancellor under Liz Truss, ""erred in law"" and failed to comply with his department's National Policy Statement on energy when reaching the decision.

She said Mr Kwarteng had failed ""to properly consider the information that he had been given"" against using an alternative site in Mannington, Dorset, which would require longer submarine cables crossing a major shipping lane.

The plans will now go back to current Business Secretary Grant Shapps for reconsideration.

A government spokesman said: ""The UK government is disappointed by the outcome but we will be considering the judgment carefully before deciding next steps.""

Portsmouth MPs and the city council had objected to the project, while former energy minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan recused herself from the process after receiving funding from one of Aquind's owners.

Aquind Limited is part-owned by former oil tycoon Viktor Fedotov, who has donated at least £430,000 to the Tory party and MPs, while director Alexander Temerko has given more than £730,000.

Commons leader Penny Mordaunt, Portsmouth North MP, vowed to ""fight on"" in her campaign to block the project.

The former defence secretary said: ""Disappointing though this decision is, I remain confident that this unwanted and unnecessary project will never happen.

""It is hard to imagine why any investor would want to be associated with it. I believe the government's decision was the right one and that it will stand.

""I also know that our whole community will again make the case for why this is so damaging, not just to our local area, but to the whole of the UK.

""We will fight on, and we must win.""

Mr Temerko has previously threatened legal action against Ms Mordaunt, who he said was the ""biggest threat to security"".

After Tuesday's ruling, Aquind director Richard Glasspool said: ""This is wonderful news for the Aquind interconnector project. We were dismayed and disappointed when Kwasi Kwarteng refused the development consent order.

""We look forward to re-engaging with local residents, stakeholders, environmental experts, and energy professionals in order to pursue the commitment to meeting the UK's net zero energy target.""

Mr Kwarteng had not been satisfied ""appropriate alternatives to the proposed route"" had been sufficiently considered and said there were particular concerns over ""the proposed landfall in an urban location"".

But at a hearing in November, Aquind claimed Mr Kwarteng was ""misled"" by officials, ""failed"" to take account of certain evidence and adopted an unfair decision-making procedure.

Simon Bird KC, for Aquind, told the court in written submissions that the proposed interconnector would be able to transmit up to 16,000,000Mwh of electricity per year, which was about 5% and 3% of the total consumption of the UK and France respectively.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230124211751/http://news.sky.com/story/govts-decision-to-reject-1-2bn-cross-channel-power-cable-project-overturned-by-high-court-12794579

In April 2022, it was announced the cross-party Privileges Committee would investigate the then prime minister once the Met Police's inquiry into lockdown breaking parties at Downing Street and the publication of the Gray Report were completed.

Witnesses are now being contacted by the committee to submit written evidence by 7 February, ahead of later oral evidence, to help the committee determine whether the PM misled the Commons in his remarks on partygate.

In December 2021, Mr Johnson was asked in the Commons whether there was a party in Downing Street on 13 November 2020, to which he replied: ""No.

""But I'm sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times.""

Sir Keir Starmer also asked him about the parties, with Mr Johnson telling the Commons: ""All guidance was followed completely in Number 10.""

In June 2022, the Privileges Committee announced it had held its first meeting on the inquiry and issued a call for evidence.

Those involved in the parties, or with direct knowledge of them, were told they had until 29 July to submit evidence and oral evidence sessions were expected to take place in the autumn.

But this was delayed, with the Cabinet Office blamed for resisting the request for key information in July last year.

A committee spokesman, confirming the new call for evidence, told Sky News: ""The committee has sent letters to individuals who may have knowledge relevant to the present inquiry regarding Boris Johnson MP, requiring them to provide evidence in writing.

""The committee requires the written evidence to be submitted by Tuesday 7th February.

""All written evidence submissions must be accompanied by a statement of truth.

""The committee may have further requests to make for additional information.""

Photos, diaries and WhatsApp messages

The Privileges Committee is made up of four Conservative MPs, two Labour and one SNP, with the chair being Labour MP Harriet Harman.

Evidence the committee has the power to call for includes documents or photographs taken at the various Downing Street events under investigation.

It can also demand oral evidence from Mr Johnson and call for his diaries, WhatsApp messages and briefing papers.

The committee said witnesses will be able to remain anonymous but the chair and committee staff will need to know who they are.

Sir Ernest Ryder, a former Appeal Court judge, has been appointed as an expert adviser to the inquiry.

What ramifications could the findings have for Mr Johnson?

Once the committee has concluded its investigation, it will decide whether it believes Mr Johnson deliberately misled parliament - and therefore committed contempt.

They can recommend what kind of sanction he should face, which all MPs will then have to vote on.

It will take a lot more than willing customers to manage future electricity supply after the great turn-off

Well, it was one hell of a turn-off.

According to Octopus energy, more than 400,000 of its customers took part in this week's National Grid scheme to reward customers to cut electricity use.

Between them, the company says they saved the equivalent of Bristol's total electricity demand in the hour the scheme ran for on Monday.

But as the grid moves fast towards net zero, it will take a lot more than a few hundred thousand willing customers to manage the peaks and troughs in electricity supply.

The government wants wind power capacity to double in the next decade and if we don't radically change the way we manage demand and supply the extremes the National Grid currently has to manage will double too.

We have the technology to do this: Batteries on the grid to store excess power on windy days; millions of electric cars connected to people's homes can do the same job too; insulated homes warmed with electric heat pumps could automatically switch off when the grid demand is high; attractive tariffs for much cheaper electricity when there's excess supply would incentivise customers.

But while we're doing pretty well at building wind turbines - we're a long way from managing demand.

Electric cars are still too expensive for most. So are heat pumps, and getting planning permission to install one can be impossible for some.

Currently, the energy market doesn't give any incentive for customers to switch to these technologies. And while COVID didn't help, energy companies have been slow to roll out a key bit of kit we need: only 50% of homes have a smart meter.

The government is working on electricity market reform and running trials of things like two-way smart meters for customers to ""sell"" electricity in their vehicle batteries back to the grid.

But there's a huge amount of detail that still needs to be worked out, and little time to do it in.

411;US and Germany reportedly preparing to send tanks to Ukraine;Tuesday 24 January 2023 23:31, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];['ukraine'];['send', 'leopard', 'germany', 'ukrainian', 'wary', 'preparing', 'western', 'ukraine', 'video', 'reportedly', 'tanks', 'uk'];"Germany and the United States will reportedly send tanks to Ukraine to help the country fight off Russia's invasion.

While there has been no official confirmation from Berlin or Washington, Ukrainian officials have celebrated what they said was a potential game-changer.

""A few hundred tanks for our tank crews - the best tank crews in the world. This is what is going to become a real

punching fist of democracy against the autocracy from the bog,"" Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, wrote on Telegram.

US President Joe Biden's administration is said to be ready to approve sending M1 Abrams tanks, while Germany is said to be preparing to send Leopard 2 tanks.

Germany's decision concerns at least one company of Leopard 2 tanks, Der Spiegel magazine said. One company is typically made up of 14 tanks.

Berlin is also expected to announce it will approve Poland's request to transfer the German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.

On Tuesday, Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said the Poles - and other Western allies he did not identify - were already training Ukrainian soldiers on the Leopards in Poland.

Kyiv has been pleading for months for Western nations to send tanks to give its forces the firepower and mobility it hopes will be able to break through Russian defensive lines and recapture territory occupied by Russia.

Germany wary move could cause Moscow to escalate further

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat party had been holding back on the move, wary it could cause Moscow to escalate further.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had said the deployment of Western tanks would trigger ""unambiguously negative"" consequences.

The German-made Leopards, used by armies across Europe, are widely considered the best option as they are available in large numbers and are easy to deploy and maintain.

Meanwhile the US M1 Abrams is considered a less suitable option due to its heavy fuel consumption and difficulty to maintain, but a move to supply the tanks would appear designed to make it easier for Germany, which has called for a united front among Ukraine's allies, to allow the supply of Leopards.

Officials reportedly said the tanks would likely be procured through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) fund, in a process that could take months or even years for the tanks to be delivered.

412;Better home insulation could mean people live longer, study suggests;Tuesday 24 January 2023 23:57, UK;[];[];['insulation', 'energy', 'mean', 'better', 'sky', 'zero', 'live', 'suggests', 'homes', 'policies', 'ventilation', 'emissions', 'net', 'power', 'study', 'longer'];"Making homes better insulated and using renewable energy to power them could mean people live longer.

That's the conclusion of a new study that found net zero policies like home insulation, if successfully introduced, would ""significantly"" cut mortality in England and Wales by 2050.

The government's net zero strategy, published in 2021, sets out a pathway to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of this century.

An extra two million years of life lived would be added across the population by 2050, if the balanced pathway plan - a 60% reduction in emissions by 2035 - was implemented, said researchers.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 10:13 National Grid: Cash to reduce energy

The study looked at six net zero policies - it argued that retrofitting homes with insulation would be the most effective, resulting in an additional 836,000 life years for the population by the middle of the century.

Switching to renewable energy to power homes was the second most-effective policy, resulting in an extra 657,000 years over the same period, the modelling suggested.

Researchers said retrofitting homes, to make them more energy efficient and reduce consumption and emissions, would mean properties get warmer in the winter.

They argued that as long as there was adequate ventilation, then people would be exposed to less pollution generated indoors, like from particles and radon.

Radon is a natural radioactive gas which comes from the decay of uranium in rocks and soil, and can seep from the ground and get into homes through the floor.

The researchers stressed that without additional ventilation, the indoor generated pollution could build up inside properties, which is bad for people's overall health.

Retrofitting can include insulating roofs, walls and floors; replacement windows; improved ventilation design; airtightness works and more efficient heating and hot water systems.

Moving forward, those behind the study claimed it may even underestimate the health benefits of net zero policies, as they did not model all the potential health benefits of the policies' implementation.

The peer-reviewed study was published in the journal, The Lancet Planetary Health.

413;NHS: What a 12-hour paramedic shift is really like;Wednesday 25 January 2023 01:11, UK;['becky johnson', '@beckyjohnsonsky'];['nhs'];['tells', 'paramedic', 'really', 'heart', 'ae', 'shift', 'danny', 'rosemary', 'ambulance', '12hour', 'dan', 'patient', 'theyre', 'edward', 'nhs'];"Ambulance response times are currently the worst on record and the NHS is struggling to cope with a surge in demand this winter.

Sky News joined West Midlands Ambulance Service paramedic Danny Thompson and ambulance technician Dan Fiedler for a 12-hour shift.

7am: Elderly couple 'too scared' to call 999

Freezing fog hangs over Coventry as Danny and Dan make sure their radios are charged and vehicle fully stocked before heading out.

It is unusually quiet to begin with, but just before 8am they get their first call.

The patient is an elderly man who has fallen and injured his arm. They switch on the sirens and the blue lights flash as they speed through the fog.

Arriving at the house, they find the patient, 86-year-old Edward, in bed. Norma, his wife, is sitting next to him.

Edward's arm is swollen and purple. It turns out he fell two days ago.

""It said on the television only call if it's a matter of life and death,"" Norma tells Danny.

He tells her to call straight away in future. They're worried patients who need help have been put off calling by the advice given on strike days.

""People are a bit scared to call ambulances because they think they're going to be stuck in corridors or in the back of an ambulance,"" Dan says.

As they prepare to take Edward, who has advanced Parkinson's, to A&E; - they chat.

Dan asks Edward how long he and Norma have been married. ""62 years,"" he says. ""How did you meet?"" Dan asks. ""In the pictures,"" Edward replies.

""He thinks I'm superwoman,"" Norma tells Danny, as she details how they manage without any carers.

But she's relieved to see the paramedics.

""When I rang my heart sank because they stop halfway through and say use www... we're not on world wide web,"" she says. ""I'm not moaning really, it's just that we haven't kept up to date with our technology"".

10am: Woman refuses to 'freeze' in A&E; despite blood clot fear

""Straight in... very unusual,"" Danny remarks as they wheel Edward into the A&E; department in Coventry where he'll have an X-ray to check if his arm is broken.

Back outside in the ambulance, their radio beeps to let them know it's been 12 minutes since they handed Edward over.

That means they're expected to be ready for the next call.

The next stop is an elderly patient whose district nurse fears could have a blood clot in her leg.

When they get to her house, Rosemary is sitting upstairs.

Her daughter explains they went to A&E; a couple of weeks ago and spent hours waiting in a freezing corridor. They don't want to go back.

After doing some tests Danny and Dan believe it's fluid and not a blood clot causing the swelling.

They agree to take her to a same-day emergency care unit at the hospital in Nuneaton.

But on their way a category one call comes in. They're the closest ambulance, so they apologise to Rosemary, switch on blue lights and head in the direction of the call.

A couple of minutes later though, they're told to stand down.

They continue on their way with Rosemary and apologise for the diversion as they leave her at the hospital.

1pm: Seizure and slow heartbeat dealt with in five minutes

They don't even get the chance to finish their lunch before another category one call comes in.

The details indicate that an elderly woman is having a seizure.

Inside the house they quickly establish there's a problem with her heart and it's serious. She's already lost consciousness once.

They wheel her into the ambulance and carry out ECG tests. Her heart rate is dropping, there's a risk it could stop.

Danny calls the hospital in Coventry to tell them to have a team ready.

Machines beep and the patient tells them she's scared.

Danny and Dan work quickly to stabilise her heart rate. Their reassuring tone as they tell her not to worry contrasts with the urgency of the situation.

They get her to A&E; within five minutes. Her heart is still beating, but very slowly.

They're both just relieved that this wasn't one of the days they've been stuck queuing outside hospital.

""The cardiac condition she had can often result in death if it's not caught in time,"" Danny says.

4pm: Good news but it was close

After completing all their paperwork, they finally get a lunch break at about 4.30pm. They can take half an hour, unless a category one call comes in. They head back to base where Dan joins a small group of colleagues.

After 30 minutes, Danny comes to get him. There's another call.

Sirens on, they make their way to a house nearby. They can't be sure the patient doesn't have a blood clot, so they take her to A&E.;

While there they find out the heart patient has had emergency surgery to fit a pacemaker. She's doing well.

It's good news to end the day. But they know it was close.

""Things can't go on as they are,"" Danny says. ""Because we're going to see patients suffering as a result of that.""

7pm: 12-hour shift over

414;Amazon strike: First formal walkout on British soil begins today;Wednesday 25 January 2023 01:28, UK;[];['amazon'];['workers', 'workforce', 'mr', 'inflation', 'amazon', 'today', 'soil', 'hour', 'westwood', 'formal', 'walkout', 'strike', 'think', 'company', 'pay', 'begins', 'british'];"Darren Westwood knows how to stick up for himself.

As a kid, he was bullied in the playground and beaten up in his local town centre. Now he doesn't take stick from anyone, no matter how big or strong they appear, even if they happen to be one of the biggest companies in the world.

Mr Westwood believes his employer, Amazon, is a bully.

Having slowly grown fed up with pay and working conditions at the company's warehouse in Coventry - where workers are on their feet all day sorting through goods to send to other warehouses - he has been corralling colleagues to support a strike.

Image: Darren Westwood

After some initial reluctance, he gradually won them over and almost 300 workers are poised to walk out today - marking the first formal strike on British soil for the online giant.

""I don't get fazed by things. I spent my life growing up and I'm at that stage where I'm not intimidated or worried,"" the 57-year-old said.

""During the pandemic, people were thanking us and we appreciated that but Amazon were still making money, while we feel like we've been left behind.""

""The money is there. I know people say that it's the politics of envy but we're not asking for his [Jeff Bezos'] yacht or his rocket. We just won't be able to pay our way. And that's all we're asking.""

Unions have traditionally had a hard time penetrating Amazon but the mood among the company's workforce shifted in August after it offered its workers what many considered to be a paltry pay rise. The online giant lifted the hourly wage by 50p to £10.50 an hour.

Upon hearing the news, workers staged an informal walkout. They were expecting more, especially as the company has enjoyed stellar profits in recent years and inflation is rising at its fastest pace in 40 years.

The GMB union seized the opportunity and helped arrange a strike, with workers voting in favour of formal action just before Christmas.

It's not just about money, however. Amazon has long been criticised for employing tough productivity targets that require workers to sort through a set number of items per hour.

Failure to do so can result in an ""adapt"", a type of warning. Staff are given up to 30-minute breaks a day, only one of which is paid.

""When you think you've got to queue up to clock out and then queue up to go through the metal detectors and security, and queue to get your food, that time does evaporate very, very quickly,"" Mr Westwood said. ""I've been one minute late back from a break before and have been given an adapt.""

The loss of up to 300 of its 1,400 workforce in Coventry is unlikely to cause Amazon any major operational problems but management will be keeping a close eye on developments. Across the globe, its workforce has started agitating. In the US, workers at a New York warehouse recently voted to start the company's first-ever labour union.

The GMB union is calling on Amazon to pay its UK workers £15 an hour to bring their wages in line with their American counterparts, who earn $18 an hour. However, Mr Westwood accepted that it would probably take a lot less than that to settle the dispute.

Image: Amazon warehouse in Coventry where workers are striking

'£2 an hour extra would be acceptable'

""I'd be happy if they just increased it by £2. I think £2 an hour extra or £2.50 an hour extra would be acceptable. I think everyone would stop then and people would be happy,"" he said.

The company told Sky News that it pays a competitive local wage that has risen by 29% since 2018.

A spokesperson added: ""We appreciate the great work our teams do throughout the year and we're proud to offer competitive pay which starts at a minimum of between £10.50 and £11.45 per hour, depending on location.

""Employees are also offered comprehensive benefits that are worth thousands more - including private medical insurance, life assurance, subsidised meals and an employee discount, to name a few.""

However, workers accuse it of cutting other benefits in the process. Crucially, the 5% pay rise it has given its staff amounts to a real-terms pay cut because inflation, which peaked at over 11% last year, has risen at more than double the pace.

Mr Westwood pointed out that the company has put the cost of its services up to reflect higher rates of inflation, while neglecting to fairly share the spoils with its workforce.

A similar story is playing out across the economy, especially in the public sector, where industrial relations are fracturing under the strain of rampant inflation. Nurses, ambulance drivers, railway workers, teachers and postal workers have all voted to down their tools and march out.

'Some nights I can't sleep'

Like some of Amazon's employees, many of them were repeatedly reminded of their value during the pandemic, when they went out to work when others stayed at home.

""These are good people,"" Mr Westwood said. ""I know that some people think that we're unskilled and this is a minimum wage for a 'minimum job'. But you need us during the pandemic. You applauded us and painted rainbows in the street. We're the same people.""

""It's 10 hours a day, standing on your feet. I do 18,000 steps and it takes its toll on people. I've got an injury to my shoulder. Some days it's just so painful. Some nights I can't sleep, it just keeps me awake. And that's from the repetitive strain of doing the same job over and over and over and over.""

While Mr Westwood is hopeful that both sides can thrash out a deal, he believes that the major gain will be to increase unionisation within the Amazon workforce to ensure workers continue to stick up for themselves.

He accepts that working for Amazon comes with benefits and many people enjoy their time there but believes the company has a long way to go.

""Colleagues are struggling to pay their bills,"" he said. ""But we work for one of the richest men in the world, at one of the richest companies in the world, in one of the richest countries in the world... it's not fair.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125013348/http://news.sky.com/story/amazon-strike-first-formal-walkout-on-british-soil-begins-today-12794634

Greece would be the only OECD nation to see less public and private investment, if the region was a country, according to a new IPPR North report.

Researchers found the UK as a whole ranks 35th out of the 38 OECD countries in terms of receiving the least investment.

Slovakia, Poland and Hungary all enjoy more investment than the UK.

If the OECD average was applied to the UK for 2017 to 2020, £397bn more would have been invested.

The report said the UK and the North are being held back by ""vast inequalities"" and ""systematic underinvestment"" in research and development, social infrastructure and transport.

The extent of regional disparities is shown in the report, including how productivity is around £7 lower per hour worked in the North than the England average, while hourly pay is £1.60 lower than the rest of England.

Northern mayors, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove and Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy are all set to attend Convention of the North today - a gathering of business, political and civic leaders from the region.

Political leaders in the region will argue that levelling up the North and South should be ""hard wired"" into UK law as they call for more long-term funding as opposed to the current competitive bidding system.

Ms Nandy will accuse the Conservatives of having ""written off"" areas that once fuelled the UK economy, while Mr Gove will say his government has over ""the greatest transfer of power form Whitehall to local leaders across England in modern times"".

Marcus Johns, IPPR research fellow and report author, said: ""Of all the advanced economies around the world, ours is the most regionally divided and getting worse - the North is at the sharp end of these divides and that's a barrier to prosperity.

""But what's even more unacceptable is that our country is divided by design. It is the result of decisions.

""The North's strengths are national strengths. Northern prosperity can be national prosperity.

""It's up to the government to unlock this potential, by acknowledging that it has to change, and by enabling empowered, well-resourced local government to coordinate and deliver long-term local visions for change.""

The report highlights other places in the world that were struggling but have turned their economies around, such as Leipzig in Germany, which is now the fastest-growing city in Europe thanks to industry and investment.

IPPR North director Zoe Billingham said: ""The international evidence is clear - governments that let go of power and collaborate positively with local places can succeed in levelling up.

""Political leaders need to 'zoom out' and learn lessons from our international neighbours to achieve regional growth and narrow our aching divides. We know that private investment follows public investment.""

After announcing the latest recipients of the government's levelling up fund last week, ministers faced accusations of favouring more affluent southeastern seats at the expense of deprived northern areas.

A government spokesman said: ""This report fundamentally misrepresents the clear steps we are taking to level up the region and we are committed to spreading opportunity across the whole of the UK, including the North of England.

""This includes investing £3.19bn through our levelling up funds for regeneration, transport and cultural projects and £3bn to transform local transport networks.

""The government has also helped secure inward investment, such as Credera in Manchester, Nissan in Sunderland and Equinor in the Port of Tyne, creating thousands of highly skilled jobs.

""We have also launched Freeports in Teeside, Liverpool City and the Humber to drive investment and signed new devolution deals in York and North Yorkshire and the North East, giving more powers to local leaders.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125024710/http://news.sky.com/story/north-of-england-sees-lowest-investment-of-advanced-economies-think-tank-finds-12794629

Darren Moore, a 39-year-old from Newport, was last seen at about 5am on Sunday while wearing full face make-up, a luminous green dress, blonde wig, heels and carrying a clutch bag.

Detectives are appealing for anyone who may have seen Mr Moore in the city centre during the early hours of Sunday to get in touch.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Raikes, who is leading the investigation, said: ""Extensive enquiries are being carried out to establish the cause and circumstances of Mr Moore's death.

""Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this time. A Home Office post-mortem has been conducted and further examinations are currently ongoing to establish cause of death.

""I would like to thank the community for the excellent support they have provided to this investigation so far this week, which has helped enormously and I would appeal for anyone with information to please come forward.

""I would also like to respectfully ask people to refrain from speculating on social media about what has occurred and please let the police investigation take its course.""

Superintendent Michelle Conquer said: ""We understand there is shock and upset in the local and wider community following the death of Darren Moore who was a well-known drag artist in Cardiff.

""While an investigation is ongoing, our neighbourhood policing team as always will continue to provide a visible police presence in the city centre.

""He was always the life and soul wherever he went, he was Our social butterfly. He made sure he had a lot of time for people, and never judged others.

""Darren's husband and family want to thank everyone for their support but now need time to grieve and respectfully request privacy at this time.""

A GoFundMe fundraising page has been set up to raise money for Mr Moore's family.

It said: ""Anyone who knew Darren would know how he was never understated in his appearance and costume. His larger-than-life character and charisma were something that you'll never forget.

It is understood the rapper - who now goes by the name Ye - was planning to visit the country to meet the family of his partner, Bianca Censori, who grew up in Melbourne.

Minister for Education Jason Clare condemned Ye's ""awful"" antisemitic comments involving Hitler and the Holocaust, saying others who had made similar statements had been denied visas.

""People like that who've applied for visas to get into Australia in the past have been rejected,"" Clare said in an interview on Channel Nine. ""I expect that if he does apply he would have to go through the same process and answer the same questions that they did.""

In recent months, Ye has made a string of antisemitic remarks - including praising Hitler, tweeting a picture of a swastika and denying the Holocaust.

Opposition leader Peter Dutton, an immigration minister under a previous government, said on Tuesday that he would be inclined to ban Ye but that it was a decision for the government.

""His antisemitic comments are disgraceful, his conduct, his behaviour are appalling,"" he told 3AW radio.

""He's not a person of good character and the minister has the ability to stop somebody coming into our country of bad character.""

Peter Wertheim, co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, met officials on Tuesday to argue in favour of banning the musician.

421;Chris Hipkins: Who is Jacinda Ardern's replacement as New Zealand's PM?;Wednesday 25 January 2023 03:24, UK;[];['jacinda ardern', 'new zealand'];['arderns', 'prime', 'labour', 'hipkins', 'zealands', 'jacinda', 'minister', 'ms', 'mr', 'replacement', 'ardern', 'covid', 'leader', 'chris'];"Chris Hipkins has been chosen to replace Jacinda Ardern as New Zealand's prime minister - and has been sworn in after her shock resignation last week.

Mr Hipkins, who is fondly known as ""Chippy"", received the unanimous support of politicians from the Labour Party after he was the only candidate to enter the race to be its next leader.

He takes on the role after Ms Ardern stepped down as Labour leader and prime minister - saying she no longer had ""enough in the tank"" to do the job justice.

Mr Hipkins will have less than nine months before contesting a tough general election, with opinion polls indicating his party is trailing its conservative opposition.

Unlike his predecessor, Mr Hipkins is not yet a household name. Here's everything we know about New Zealand's new prime minister.

Hipkins and the pandemic

Mr Hipkins, 44, became well-known in New Zealand for fronting the government's response to the pandemic, regularly appearing in daily televised news conferences.

He was appointed health minister in July 2020 before becoming the COVID response minister at the end of the year, a role he kept until June 2022.

New Zealand's strict COVID restrictions, which included closing the border and locking the country down when case numbers were low, won the government plaudits in the early days of the virus.

Globally, Ms Ardern received the bulk of the praise. But her successor clearly had a key role leading in her government on the detail.

It's worth noting that New Zealand's strict COVID restrictions became less popular as the pandemic wore on.

That partly accounts for the tough polling numbers the Labour Party is now facing in the country, with political opponents blaming the COVID rules for holding back the economy.

Other roles in parliament

Mr Hipkins has worn many hats since entering parliament in 2008.

He became spokesperson for education in 2013 and has served as minister for education since Labour formed a government in 2017.

He became minister for police in mid-2022 as the country experienced a surge in crime rates, and has also been the minister for public service, as well as leader of the house.

The new Labour leader and prime minister will have to act swiftly to find replacements for his responsibilities as he adjusts to his new roles.

Viral TV gaffe

The incoming PM is known for his sense of humour and poking fun at himself.

When New Zealand was in a nationwide lockdown in August 2021, Mr Hipkins went viral for a gaffe on live TV when he urged people to get outside and ""spread their legs"" - rather than stretch their legs.

He later appeared at a news conference drinking out of a mug which read ""spread your legs, not the virus"".

He is also famed for his love of Coke Zero and sausage rolls, with a sausage roll birthday cake from parliamentary colleagues once making headlines at home and abroad.

Jacinda Ardern's advice to Chris Hipkins

At Ms Ardern's final appearance as prime minister, she told reporters the only advice she could offer to her successor was, ""You do you.""

""This is for him now. It's for him to carve out his own space to be his own kind of leader,"" Ms Ardern said.

""Actually, there's no advice I can really impart. I can share information, I can share experiences, but this is now for him.""

What Mr Hipkins has said about his predecessor

Mr Hipkins called Ms Ardern one of New Zealand's greatest prime ministers and an inspiration to women and girls.

""She gave voice to those often overlooked in times of challenge and purposefully went about doing politics differently,"" he said.

But some of the hate Ms Ardern faced during her time in office is a reminder that ""we've got a way to go to ensure women in leadership receive the same respect as their male counterparts"", he added.

Mr Hipkins' family life

Speaking at the news conference announcing his appointment, Mr Hipkins said he will keep his family ""completely out of the limelight"" after seeing the public scrutiny of Ms Ardern's family.

He said he and his wife had separated a year ago but remained ""incredibly close"" and were raising their two children together.

423;Does Germany sending tanks to Ukraine mean the US is open to sending their own?;Wednesday 25 January 2023 03:51, UK;['mark stone', '@stone_skynews'];['ukraine'];['sophisticated', 'spokesman', 'mean', 'tank', 'germany', 'ukrainian', 'supply', 'western', 'american', 'ukraine', 'open', 'sending', 'tanks', 'war', 'does'];"Generously, you'd call the tank debate an evolution of views among Western policymakers.

Ungenerously, it's rather a debacle and certainly doesn't present the united front that Western nations have strived for through this year-old war.

The Ukrainians have become used to this pattern of Western indecision.

It follows a now familiar pattern: have an almighty row, say ""no"", and then agree. It's almost baked into Ukrainian request lead time.

The news from Berlin and Warsaw - that tanks can go to Ukraine after all - suggests movement from the Americans.

Remember the Germans had said consistently that they didn't want it to be only their tank fighting the Russians. (The British offering of a handful of Challenger 2s didn't swing them.)

The Germans wanted the American M1 Abrams tank alongside their own Leopards.

The Americans said no. Their tank is much larger, has fuel issues - it's designed to work with jet fuel not readily available on the Ukrainian frontline, it's far heavier and relies on a unique, complex supply chain. Remember, in war, the success of any army and its kit is wholly reliant on a constant, smooth supply chain.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:10 Will Germany send tanks to Ukraine?

The M1 Abrams is also highly sophisticated and packed full of manufacturing secrets including composite armour containing hard-to-penetrate depleted uranium meshing.

The battle tank is the tip of an army's spear. If it's destroyed and left the wrong side of advancing enemy lines, then its secrets are compromised.

It's one thing having American troops operating and, if needed, destroying their own damaged tanks. Can they rely on Ukrainian soldiers doing the same? This will be one consideration among many for the Americans when considering supplying their Abrams.

Within the American debate, opinion has been split. ""Why not provide just a few tanks, older less sophisticated models, to unlock the impasse?"" some politicians and generals have asked.

Even the former British prime minister, such a staunch supporter of Ukraine, chimed in.

""Where does the Western world need to station tanks at the moment?"" Boris Johnson asked.

""Guarding North Rhine-Westphalia? Protecting Tennessee? Prowling the villages of Wiltshire? So let me pose the question again: what conceivable grounds can there be for delay?""

At the Pentagon, the spokesman wouldn't be drawn, even as the word from Berlin was of movement.

But spokesman General Pat Ryder did hint at an announcement down the line, talking about not wanting to ""preview an announcement"".

And so expect news perhaps as soon as today from Washington. It's likely that any American tanks will take some time to reach the battlefield.

This will allow for the supply chain concerns to be ironed out and to allow time for training. It could also provide space to explore ways to reduce the risk of any prized technology within the tanks from getting into the hands of the Russians.

Of course the perennial unknown: how will Putin react?

Sky News understands that American officials will soon announce their intention to send Abrams tanks to help the country fight off Russia's invasion.

And German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is set to address MPs in parliament at lunchtime, where he is expected to confirm media reports that Leopard 2 tanks will be sent to the frontline.

Analysis: US set to announce plans to send tanks to Ukraine - but why, when and what are the risks?

While there has been no official confirmation from Berlin or Washington, Ukrainian officials have celebrated what they said was a potential game-changer.

""A few hundred tanks for our tank crews - the best tank crews in the world. This is what is going to become a real punching fist of democracy against the autocracy from the bog,"" Andriy Yermak, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, wrote on Telegram.

Mr Zelenskyy took a more cautious approach in his evening address, and said: ""There is a lot of talk about tanks now, about the modern tanks we need and about how this deficit can be filled. Many efforts, words, promises. But it is important to see reality; it is not five, or 10, or 15 tanks. The need is greater.""

According to Der Spiegel, Germany is preparing to send at least one company of Leopard 2 tanks - and one company is typically made up of 14 tanks.

Berlin is also expected to announce it will approve Poland's request to transfer the German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.

On Tuesday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said the Poles - and other Western allies he did not identify - were already training Ukrainian soldiers on the Leopards in Poland.

Kyiv has been pleading for months for Western nations to send tanks to give its forces the firepower and mobility it hopes will be able to break through Russian defensive lines and recapture territory occupied by Russia.

Germany wary move could cause Moscow to escalate further

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat party had been holding back on the move, wary it could cause Moscow to escalate further.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had said the deployment of Western tanks would trigger ""unambiguously negative"" consequences.

The German-made Leopards, used by armies across Europe, are widely considered the best option as they are available in large numbers and are easy to deploy and maintain.

Meanwhile the US M1 Abrams is considered a less suitable option due to its heavy fuel consumption and difficulty to maintain, but a move to supply the tanks would appear designed to make it easier for Germany, which has called for a united front among Ukraine's allies, to allow the supply of Leopards.

Officials reportedly said the tanks would likely be procured through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative fund, in a process that could take months or even years for the tanks to be delivered.

However, a 75-year-old hiker who was lost on the same snow-covered mountain has been brought to safety.

NBC LA captured images of Jin Chung, of North Hollywood, being loaded into an ambulance on Tuesday afternoon.

He had hurt his leg and suffered some weather-related injuries but was able to walk with assistance and was taken to hospital, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said.

His condition was not immediately known.

The Sheriff's Department launched the search after Chung didn't return from a hike Sunday on 10,064-foot Mount Baldy.

Chung carpooled to the mountain with two others and made plans to meet them at the vehicle at 2pm, but failed to return.

The sheriff's department said rescuers unsuccessfully continued searching for Sands on Mount Baldy over the weekend.

""Helicopters and drones continued to use infrared devices during the search however, all were negative for any signs of Sands,"" the department's statement added.

Sands, 65, was reported missing on 13 January while hiking.

Search and rescue crews began looking for him on the highest peak in the San Gabriel Mountains, about 40 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.

""No evidence of his current location has been discovered. The search will continue, weather and ground conditions permitting,"" a sheriff's department statement said.

Storms have coated the mountain with heavy snow and ice and searches have been thwarted by the threat of avalanches and foul weather, including powerful winds.

Authorities describe the mountain conditions as extremely dangerous with two hikers dying in recent weeks. One fell at least 152m (500ft) down an icy slope.

Sands starred opposite Helena Bonham Carter in the 1985 British romance from director James Ivory, A Room With a View.

He also had major roles in in 1989's Warlock, 1990's Arachnophobia, 1991's Naked Lunch, 1993's Boxing Helena and Leaving Las Vegas in 1995.

426;Amazon strike: First formal walkout on British soil has begun;Wednesday 25 January 2023 05:59, UK;[];['amazon'];['workers', 'workforce', 'mr', 'inflation', 'amazon', 'soil', 'hour', 'company', 'westwood', 'formal', 'walkout', 'strike', 'think', 'pay', 'begun', 'british'];"Darren Westwood knows how to stick up for himself.

As a kid, he was bullied in the playground and beaten up in his local town centre. Now he doesn't take stick from anyone, no matter how big or strong they appear, even if they happen to be one of the biggest companies in the world.

Mr Westwood believes his employer, Amazon, is a bully.

Having slowly grown fed up with pay and working conditions at the company's warehouse in Coventry - where workers are on their feet all day sorting through goods to send to other warehouses - he has been corralling colleagues to support a strike.

After some initial reluctance, he gradually won them over and almost 300 workers are poised to walk out today - marking the first formal strike on British soil for the online giant.

""I don't get fazed by things. I spent my life growing up and I'm at that stage where I'm not intimidated or worried,"" the 57-year-old said.

""During the pandemic, people were thanking us and we appreciated that but Amazon were still making money, while we feel like we've been left behind.""

""The money is there. I know people say that it's the politics of envy but we're not asking for his [Jeff Bezos'] yacht or his rocket. We just won't be able to pay our way. And that's all we're asking.""

Unions have traditionally had a hard time penetrating Amazon but the mood among the company's workforce shifted in August after it offered its workers what many considered to be a paltry pay rise. The online giant lifted the hourly wage by 50p to £10.50 an hour.

Upon hearing the news, workers staged an informal walkout. They were expecting more, especially as the company has enjoyed stellar profits in recent years and inflation is rising at its fastest pace in 40 years.

The GMB union seized the opportunity and helped arrange a strike, with workers voting in favour of formal action just before Christmas.

It's not just about money, however. Amazon has long been criticised for employing tough productivity targets that require workers to sort through a set number of items per hour.

Failure to do so can result in an ""adapt"", a type of warning. Staff are given up to 30-minute breaks a day, only one of which is paid.

""When you think you've got to queue up to clock out and then queue up to go through the metal detectors and security, and queue to get your food, that time does evaporate very, very quickly,"" Mr Westwood said. ""I've been one minute late back from a break before and have been given an adapt.""

The loss of up to 300 of its 1,400 workforce in Coventry is unlikely to cause Amazon any major operational problems but management will be keeping a close eye on developments. Across the globe, its workforce has started agitating. In the US, workers at a New York warehouse recently voted to start the company's first-ever labour union.

The GMB union is calling on Amazon to pay its UK workers £15 an hour to bring their wages in line with their American counterparts, who earn $18 an hour. However, Mr Westwood accepted that it would probably take a lot less than that to settle the dispute.

Image: Amazon warehouse in Coventry where workers are striking

'£2 an hour extra would be acceptable'

""I'd be happy if they just increased it by £2. I think £2 an hour extra or £2.50 an hour extra would be acceptable. I think everyone would stop then and people would be happy,"" he said.

The company told Sky News that it pays a competitive local wage that has risen by 29% since 2018.

A spokesperson added: ""We appreciate the great work our teams do throughout the year and we're proud to offer competitive pay which starts at a minimum of between £10.50 and £11.45 per hour, depending on location.

""Employees are also offered comprehensive benefits that are worth thousands more - including private medical insurance, life assurance, subsidised meals and an employee discount, to name a few.""

However, workers accuse it of cutting other benefits in the process. Crucially, the 5% pay rise it has given its staff amounts to a real-terms pay cut because inflation, which peaked at over 11% last year, has risen at more than double the pace.

Mr Westwood pointed out that the company has put the cost of its services up to reflect higher rates of inflation, while neglecting to fairly share the spoils with its workforce.

A similar story is playing out across the economy, especially in the public sector, where industrial relations are fracturing under the strain of rampant inflation. Nurses, ambulance drivers, railway workers, teachers and postal workers have all voted to down their tools and march out.

'Some nights I can't sleep'

Like some of Amazon's employees, many of them were repeatedly reminded of their value during the pandemic, when they went out to work when others stayed at home.

""These are good people,"" Mr Westwood said. ""I know that some people think that we're unskilled and this is a minimum wage for a 'minimum job'. But you need us during the pandemic. You applauded us and painted rainbows in the street. We're the same people.""

""It's 10 hours a day, standing on your feet. I do 18,000 steps and it takes its toll on people. I've got an injury to my shoulder. Some days it's just so painful. Some nights I can't sleep, it just keeps me awake. And that's from the repetitive strain of doing the same job over and over and over and over.""

While Mr Westwood is hopeful that both sides can thrash out a deal, he believes that the major gain will be to increase unionisation within the Amazon workforce to ensure workers continue to stick up for themselves.

He accepts that working for Amazon comes with benefits and many people enjoy their time there but believes the company has a long way to go.

""Colleagues are struggling to pay their bills,"" he said. ""But we work for one of the richest men in the world, at one of the richest companies in the world, in one of the richest countries in the world... it's not fair.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125060207/http://news.sky.com/story/amazon-strike-first-formal-walkout-on-british-soil-has-begun-12794634

431;Ants can 'sniff out' cancer in urine, scientists find;Wednesday 25 January 2023 06:39, UK;[];['cancer'];['trials', 'human', 'mice', 'urine', 'ants', 'scientists', 'cancer', 'healthy', 'researchers', 'detect', 'sniff', 'dettorre'];"Ants can smell cancer in urine, scientists have found.

Several types of cancer have been found to alter the smell of urine, but for the first time experts have found ants have the ability to detect the scent.

In their findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, they said these insects could be used as a cost-effective way to identify cancers in patients.

Study author Professor Patrizia d'Ettorre, of Sorbonne Paris Nord University, said: ""Ants can be used as bio-detectors to discriminate healthy individuals from tumour-bearing ones.

""They are easy to train, learn fast, are very efficient and are not expensive to keep.""

This research builds on a previous study by Prof d'Ettorre and her colleagues where they showed that ants were able to ""sniff out"" human cancer cells grown in the lab.

For the current study, the researchers exposed 70 ants - belonging to the species known as Formica fusca - to urine samples from mice with, and without, tumours.

After three trials, the ants were able to tell the difference between the urine odour of healthy mice from that of mice with tumours.

This is because ants have a very sensitive olfactory system, the researchers said.

Prof d'Ettorre told PA: ""We trained them with associative learning to associate a given odour - cancer - with a reward and, after very few trials, they learned the association.

""We demonstrated that ants can discriminate the urine of healthy mice from the urine of tumour-bearing mice.

""This is more similar to a real-life situation than using cultured cancer cells.

""We were surprised by how efficient and reliable the ants are.""

As part of the next steps, the researchers want to see if the ants can do the same for human urine.

Previous research has shown dogs can detect cancer by sniffing urine after being trained to do so.

There are also electronic devices that can detect certain types of cancer - such as bladder, breast or prostate - from urine samples.

The human nose, however, cannot pick up the scent of cancer in urine.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125073220/http://news.sky.com/story/ants-can-sniff-out-cancer-in-urine-scientists-find-12794810
432;Ukraine war - latest: Russia warns US against 'blatant provocation' as tanks announcement expected as soon as today;;[];['live', 'russia', 'ukraine'];['send', 'americans', 'supply', 'today', 'warns', 'soon', 'russia', 'provocation', 'ukraine', 'latest', 'western', 'course', 'issues', 'expected', 'sending', 'tanks', 'war', 'provision'];"American announcement on sending tanks 'very, very soon' - is this an end to Western division on the issue?

We have been discussing the potential provision, by the US and Germany, of tanks to Ukraine over the course of the last few days.

It appears as though the West has been somewhat divided on this issue, with Germany insisting it would not send its tanks unless the US did the same.

""It was only a few days ago that the Americans were giving a firm no to Ukrainian requests for their battle tanks to be deployed to the front line,"" says US correspondent Mark Stone.

Though the UK has already announced it will send 14 Challenger 2 tanks, analysts have suggested a much wider provision is required to have a real impact on the conflict.

The aim of sending more tanks would be helping Kyiv not just hold territory, but push Vladimir Putin's forces back.

Russia, of course, would see this as a provocation - which goes some way to explaining Western reticence.

""If you were being generous you could say an evolution of thought has taken place by the Americans and the rest of the Western allies,"" says Stone. ""Ungenerously, you could call it a bit of a debacle.



""This issue has represented a split in opinion among the Western allies who have tried, as much as they can, to be united on the war and how to counter the Russian offensive.

""It is now clear that over the course of the last few days something has changed and we can expect an announcement from the White House any time now - today is very, very likely, I think.

""What this will do is unlock the German reluctance.""

Another factor that has perhaps contributed to a hesitance from Washington is logistical.

Stone explains: ""The Americans have got concerns about the supply chains.

""Their M1 Abrams is a very complex bit of equipment. They were worried, for example, that the jet fuel it needs to get it moving is not readily available on the front lines in eastern Ukraine. There are supply issues, maintenance issues.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125073220/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russia-warns-us-against-blatant-provocation-as-tanks-announcement-expected-as-soon-as-today-12541713

435;Gambling company In Touch Games fined £6.1m for 'social responsibility and money laundering failings';Wednesday 25 January 2023 07:56, UK;[];[];['failings', 'flagged', 'touch', 'fined', 'fine', 'commission', 'money', 'failures', 'responsibility', 'company', 'firm', 'laundering', 'gambling', 'games', 'social'];"Gambling firm In Touch Games has been fined millions by a regulator for ""social responsibility and money laundering failings"".

The Gambling Commission said the company, which operates a number of online sites including bonusboss.co.uk, had been slapped with a £6.1m penalty - its third fine related to oversight failures.

The issues at In Touch Games, the watchdog said, included not having appropriate policies, procedures and controls in place and not sufficiently considering or implementing the regulator's money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment or guidance.

It also accused the firm of not acting in customers' best interests.

The commission cited an example, saying In Touch had not interacted with a customer until seven weeks after they had been flagged for erratic and extended play.

It said a customer's word that they earned £6,000 a month had been accepted without verification until they were flagged for gambling during unsociable hours.

It is the third time the company, whose brands also include cashmo.co.uk, drslot.co.uk, jammymonkey.com and slotfactory.com, has been penalised.

In 2019 it paid a £2.2m settlement for failures and in 2021 it received a £3.4m fine and warning for further failures.

Kay Roberts, executive director of operations at the Gambling Commission, said: ""Considering this operator's history of failings we expected to see significant improvement when we carried out our planned compliance assessment.

""Disappointingly, although many improvements had been made, there was still more to do.

It was reported overnight that the US and Germany are both now prepared to send tanks to Ukraine, after weeks of back and forth on the matter.

An announcement from the White House is expected as soon as today - and could see 30 M1 Abrams tanks provided to Kyiv - while Olaf Schloz will reportedly make his decision this morning.

It is thought he will send at least 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.

This could mean donations of the tanks will be permitted from other countries, but it has yet to be confirmed that this is the case.

Hearing this news overnight, Russian state media has reacted with fury, with presenter Vladimir Solovyov urging the Kremlin to bomb Germany in response.

Francis Scarr, who reports on Russian state TV for the BBC, posted a clip on social media.

He cited Mr Solovyov as saying that Germans need to ""know which new Nazi leaders they've raised and brought to power.""

It did not say how many were affected, but Downdetector.com which tracks outages through a range of sources including user reports, recorded thousands of people reporting problems with Teams, Outlook, Microsoft 365 and XBox Live.

It showed there were around 4,992 incidents of people reporting issues with email platform Outlook in the UK as of 8am today - and 2,173 with Teams.

Users in areas including Manchester, London, Birmingham, Norwich, Oxford, Brighton and Cardiff were reporting problems.

The site also reported more than 3,900 incidents of people reporting issues with Microsoft Teams in India and over 900 in Japan. Outage reports also spiked in other countries including Australia and the United Arab Emirates.

During the outage, most users were unable to exchange messages, join calls or use any features of the Team application - forcing office workers to return to in-person meetings and use other social media platforms to communicate with one another.

Microsoft tweeted: ""We're investigating issues impacting multiple Microsoft 365 services. More info can be found in the admin center under MO502273.""

It later added: ""We've identified a potential networking issue and are reviewing telemetry to determine the next troubleshooting steps.""

Microsoft's cloud unit Azure also tweeted about the outage, and said that a subset of users were experiencing problems with the platform.

Many Microsoft users posted on social media to share updates, with #MicrosoftTeams trending as a hashtag on Twitter.

""Microsoft Teams and outlook are having issues here in Ethiopia… are these services down?"" one social media user tweeted.

Another wrote: ""Microsoft Outlook, Teams services down in Sri Lanka and around the globe.""

Microsoft Teams is used by more than 280 million people worldwide and forms an essential part of daily operations for businesses and schools which use the service to make calls, schedule meetings and organise their workflow.

Microsoft Exchange Online, SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business were also among the services affected, according to the company's status page.

The outage comes after Microsoft - which employs more than 220,000 people including 6,000 in the UK - last week announced plans for 10,000 job cuts across its global operations.

Hilton, the granddaughter of Hilton Hotels' founder Conrad Hilton, has been married to Carter Reum since 2021 and has previously spoken of her desire to have children.

However, the announcement came as a surprise to many fans, as she starred in a Miley Cyrus New Year's Eve special on NBC at the end of 2022, and did not appear to be pregnant.

US media outlet People reported that the couple had welcomed a son via surrogate.

In December 2022, Hilton told E! News that she and Reum had wanted to enjoy their first year of marriage and ""were always planning on 2023"" to expand their family.

""And we've just, you know... getting the eggs all ready. They're all ready and they're all waiting and excited for them.""

The 41-year-old told E! at the time: ""I always loved kids, but I just never found the person that I could trust to do that with. But now that I did, I just can't wait, and he's gonna be the best father and we're just gonna have the most magical life together.""

""We don't know what the timescales are for the inquiry, and I think that's key,"" he told Sky News.

""I think he should be considering whether he stands aside for the period of the inquiry.""

Image: Lord Hayward

It comes after former minister Caroline Nokes said there were ""too many unanswered questions"" over the tax row and said Mr Zahawi should ""stand aside and let the investigation run its course"".

The inquiry by new ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus is expected to focus on whether the cabinet minister breached the ministerial code with the estimated £4.8m HMRC settlement he made while he was chancellor, but it could extend to his prior tax arrangement and whether he lied to the media.

Rishi Sunak said there are ""questions that need answering"" but has come under criticism for resisting calls to sack him.

It is unclear what the prime minister knew about Mr Zahawi's dealings with the tax office when he appointed him to his cabinet in October.

Lord Hayward is also a polling expert, and advised previous Conservative governments heading into elections.

He said that the issues Mr Sunak is facing at the moment, including Mr Zahawi's tax affairs, are working in tandem with the ongoing strikes to ""flatline"" the Conservative Party's popularity.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is likely to seize on the fallout from Mr Zahawi's multi-million pound settlement at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.

Paramedics found Edward, 86, with a bruised and swollen arm when they were sent to his home.

Sky News was following West Midlands Ambulance Service paramedic Danny Thompson and ambulance technician Dan Fiedler on a 12-hour shift when they responded to the call.

Ambulance response times are the worst on record and the NHS is struggling to cope with a surge in demand this winter.

7am: Elderly couple 'too scared' to call 999

Freezing fog hangs over Coventry as Danny and Dan make sure their radios are charged and vehicle fully stocked before heading out.

It is unusually quiet to begin with, but just before 8am they get their first call.

They are told the patient is an elderly man who has fallen and injured his arm. They switch on the sirens and the blue lights flash as they speed through the fog.

Arriving at the house, they find Edward in bed. Norma, his wife, is sitting next to him.

Edward's arm is purple. It turns out he fell two days ago.

""It said on the television only call if it's a matter of life and death,"" Norma tells Danny.

Image: Danny and Edward in the ambulance

He tells her to call straight away in future. They're worried patients who need help have been put off calling by the advice given on strike days.

""People are a bit scared to call ambulances because they think they're going to be stuck in corridors or in the back of an ambulance,"" Dan says.

As they prepare to take Edward, who has advanced Parkinson's, to A&E;, they chat.

Dan asks Edward how long he and Norma have been married. ""62 years,"" he says. ""How did you meet?"" Dan asks. ""In the pictures,"" Edward replies.

""He thinks I'm superwoman,"" Norma tells Danny, as she details how they manage without any carers.

But she's relieved to see the paramedics.

""When I rang my heart sank because they stop halfway through and say use www... we're not on the world wide web,"" she says. ""I'm not moaning really, it's just that we haven't kept up to date with our technology.""

10am: Woman refuses to 'freeze' in A&E; despite blood clot fear

""Straight in... very unusual,"" Danny remarks as they wheel Edward into the A&E; department in Coventry where he'll have an X-ray to check if his arm is broken.

Back outside in the ambulance, their radio beeps to let them know it's been 12 minutes since they handed Edward over.

That means they're expected to be ready for the next call.

The next stop is an elderly patient whose district nurse fears could have a blood clot in her leg.

When they get to her house, Rosemary is sitting upstairs.

Her daughter explains they went to A&E; a couple of weeks ago and spent hours waiting in a freezing corridor. They don't want to go back.

After doing some tests, Danny and Dan believe it's fluid and not a blood clot causing the swelling.

They agree to take her to a same-day emergency care unit at the hospital in Nuneaton.

But on their way a category one call comes in. They're the closest ambulance, so they apologise to Rosemary, switch on blue lights and head in the direction of the call.

A couple of minutes later, they're told to stand down.

They continue on their way with Rosemary and apologise for the diversion as they leave her at the hospital.

1pm: Seizure and slow heartbeat dealt with in five minutes

They don't get the chance to finish their lunch before another category one call comes in.

The details indicate that an elderly woman is having a seizure.

Inside the house they quickly establish there's a problem with her heart and it's serious. She's already lost consciousness once.

They wheel her into the ambulance and carry out ECG tests. Her heart rate is dropping, there's a risk it could stop.

Danny calls the hospital in Coventry to tell them to have a team ready.

Machines beep and the patient tells them she's scared.

Danny and Dan work quickly to stabilise her heart rate. Their reassuring tone as they tell her not to worry contrasts with the urgency of the situation.

They get her to A&E; within five minutes. Her heart is still beating, but very slowly.

They're both just relieved that this wasn't one of the days they've been stuck queuing outside hospital.

""The cardiac condition she had can often result in death if it's not caught in time,"" Danny says.

4pm: Good news but it was close

After completing all their paperwork, they finally get a lunch break at about 4.30pm. They can take half an hour, unless a category one call comes in. They head back to base where Dan joins a small group of colleagues.

After 30 minutes, Danny comes to get him. There's another call.

Sirens on, they make their way to a house nearby. They can't be sure the patient doesn't have a blood clot, so they take her to A&E.;

While there they find out the heart patient has had emergency surgery to fit a pacemaker. She's doing well.

It's good news to end the day. But they know it was close.

""Things can't go on as they are,"" Danny says. ""Because we're going to see patients suffering as a result of that.""

7pm: 12-hour shift over

444;Met Police condemn 'sickening' child sexual offences by serving officer;Wednesday 25 January 2023 08:23, UK;[];[];['met', '2021', 'offences', 'child', 'relationship', 'sickening', 'engaging', 'pleaded', 'condemn', 'chehab', 'schools', 'role', 'sexual', 'girl', 'officer', 'serving'];"A serving Metropolitan Police officer has pleaded guilty to child sexual offences.

PC Hussain Chehab, 22, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual activity with a girl aged 13 to 15 - as well as three counts of making indecent photographs of a child, and one of engaging in sexual communication with a child.

He appeared at Wood Green Crown Court in north London yesterday and was released on bail for sentencing on 17 March.

Chehab's offending came to light in July 2021 when the family of a 16-year-old girl raised concerns with police that she had recently been in a relationship with the officer, which they believed began when she was 15.

He was arrested the following month and placed on restricted duties, which involved no contact with schools or children.

A number of digital devices were seized and examined, during which a number of indecent images were found and he was further arrested in October 2021 and suspended from duty.

Analysis of further devices revealed messages between Chehab and a 14-year-old girl engaging in sexual communication. She later provided evidence to police that they had entered into a sexual relationship in 2019 when she was 14 years old.

Detective Chief Superintendent Caroline Haines said: ""Our thoughts foremost today are with the young girls who Chehab exploited and took advantage of for his own sexual gratification.

""These offences are made all the more sickening by the fact that some of the image offences were committed while PC Chehab was in a role as a Safer Schools officer attached to a secondary school in Enfield between May 2021 and his arrest in August 2021.""

She added: ""This news will of course cause considerable damage and concern, not only to the local community, but Londoners as a whole, who place their trust in police officers to go into our schools alongside their children every day and keep them safe.

""While no evidence has been found linking any of Chehab's offending to his role, we are engaging with our local schools, community forums and independent advisory groups to reassure them following the damage his actions will have caused.

""The Met continues to ruthlessly target those who corrupt our identity. We have made it clear there is no place for the likes of PC Chehab in the Met and will take quick and immediate action to arrest and prosecute anyone who commits such abhorrent criminal acts, and will work to quickly remove them from the organisation.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125093217/http://news.sky.com/story/met-police-condemn-sickening-child-sexual-offences-by-serving-officer-12794837

The Kremlin says it is ""genuinely alarming"" that the ""Doomsday Clock"" had moved closer to midnight than ever and urged vigilance to prevent the risk of nuclear war.

The Doomsday Clock was yesterday set at 90 seconds to midnight - representing a time of ""unprecedented danger"" - largely because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The prize fund has not been so high since May 2008, almost 15 years ago.

The latest change follows the rate increasing from 2.20% to 3.00% at the start of January.

Germany said that partner countries that have stocks of the NATO-standard tank can now donate them to Kyiv.

Although Ukraine has stocks of Soviet-made tanks, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president, says his forces need more, faster and deadlier weapons - in particular Western tanks - to push the Russians back.

Kyiv has been pleading for months for Western nations to send tanks to give its forces the firepower and mobility it hopes will be able to break through Russian defensive lines and recapture territory occupied by Russia.

There had been a sense of frustration among some of Germany's allies about the delay in authorising the Leopards to go to Ukraine.

The German decision comes after the UK announced it would provide 14 Challenger 2 tanks, which was widely seen as an attempt to persuade other allies to send Leopards, of which there are much higher stocks across Europe.

Sky News understands that American officials will soon announce their intention to send Abrams tanks to help Kyiv fight off Russia's invasion.

JD Wetherspoon's chairman, Tim Martin, has long-complained about supermarkets' treatment when it comes to the payment of Value Added Tax (VAT), saying it gives them an unfair advantage - particularly at a time when the hospitality sector is struggling to recover from the COVID pandemic because of the cost of living crisis.

""Supermarkets pay zero VAT in respect of food sales, whereas pubs and restaurants pay 20%. This tax benefit allows supermarkets to subsidise the selling price of beer,"" he wrote.

""We estimate that supermarkets have taken about half of the pub industry's beer volumes since Wetherspoon started trading in 1979, a process that has likely accelerated following the pandemic.""

He complained: ""Pub industry directors have, in general, failed to campaign for tax equality, which is an important principle of taxation.

""Unless the industry campaigns strongly for equality, it will inevitably shrink relative to supermarkets, which will not help high streets, tourism, the economy overall, or the ancient institution of the pub.""

He made his remarks against a backdrop of strong trading for major supermarket chains, which benefited hugely from lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions as pubs and restaurants were forced to shut their doors.

Trading updates since Christmas have largely shown continued sales growth as shoppers eat and drink more at home because of the squeeze on their finances from energy-led inflation.

Mr Martin's plea was contained in an update to the market on the value-focused chain's performance.

He said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the current financial year despite its sales for the 25 weeks to 22 January falling below pre-pandemic levels.

Like-for-like sales were 0.7% lower than the corresponding period immediately before COVID.

Performance dropped further - by 2% - in the last 12 weeks, underscoring the hit to trading during the traditionally strong festive season.

Rivals have blamed the surge in living costs and disruption caused by rail strikes.

Wetherspoons, which has more than 900 pubs and hotels, said however that like-for-like sales were 13.1% higher for the 25 weeks from a year earlier.

Shares were more than 2% down in early deals.

Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Wetherspoon's value offer is helping it to outperform its peers, and the recent steps it's taken to shore up the balance sheet leave it well placed to ride out the storm.

""As the clouds continue to darken for the hospitality sector, it may be a case of last man standing.

""Wetherspoon will in our opinion no doubt survive, and indeed prosper with increased market share for when the cycle turns. But in the short term, the news could well get worse before it gets better.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125104837/http://news.sky.com/story/pub-chain-issues-rallying-cry-to-hospitality-industry-over-tax-disparity-12794934

Advice for road users when travelling in freezing fog • Avoid travel if possible • Drive very slowly with dipped headlights as full-beam lights reflect off the fog causing a 'white wall' effect • Keep an eye on your speed as fog can give the illusion of moving in slow motion • Use fog lights, but remember to turn them off when the visibility improves • Don't hang on the lights of the car in front. Rear lights can give a false sense of security • Watch out for freezing fog which is made of water droplets that freeze on contact with objects such as the pavement, road, car, etc. It can quickly form a layer of ice Information provided by the Met Office in conjunction with the Highways Agency

Authorities on the Russian border are reportedly telling migrants they are unable to leave the country because their names are on mobilisation lists, a US-based thinktank has reported.

The Institute for the Study of War suggested that Russia is likely continuing efforts to mobilise ethnic minorities to fight in Ukraine, despite a call-up of 300,000 reservists ending months ago.

The ISW pointed to reports by Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty, which claimed ""Russian border guards are preventing Kyrgyz migrants from leaving Russia and telling migrants that their names are on mobilisation lists"".

This report, made on 22 January, came a week after the head of the Russian Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, proposed the mobilisation of all migrants who received Russian passports.

""The Ukrainian Resistance Centre noted on 24 January that the policy of mobilising migrants might feasibly extend to forcibly deported Ukrainians who are now living in Russia and were forced to acquire Russian citizenship.""

Meanwhile, the ISW said it is widely believed that so-called ""covert"" mobilisation in ongoing in Russia for the war in Ukraine.

It said: ""A local Stavropol Krai media outlet reported on 20 January that several people received summonses to appear at military enlistment offices within a week to 'clarify' their personal data.

A wide open goal for Sir Keir Starmer today is provided by Nadhim Zahawi's tax affairs, a week after the prime minister declared it case closed.

The Tory party chairman is now under investigation by Rishi Sunak's Independent Adviser on Ministerial interests over the penalty he admits paying - said to be worth £3.m.

This week, the PM's official spokesman would not even say whether he thought Mr Zahawi had told the truth about his tax bills.

Last week, Mr Sunak responded to a question from a Labour MP, who asked when the PM became aware of the HMRC investigation into Mr Zahawi's tax affairs, by saying the party chairman ""has already addressed this matter in full and there is nothing more I can add"".

In fact, Mr Zahawi's team had more to add over the weekend, to make clear that he did pay a penalty which he said HMRC had deemed ""careless and not deliberate"".

Mr Sunak's problem is this investigation may drag on for a while.

One senior Tory MP, Caroline Nokes, has gone on record to say Mr Zahawi should stand aside.

Today on Sky News, the Tory peer and pollster Lord Hayward said as the man who should be geeing up the activists ahead of a tough local election campaign, the party chairman should consider his position.

Other Tories privately say it looks like game over for Zahawi's position in cabinet.

Sir Keir is likely to ask forensic questions about dates, as he did during the partygate scandal, as to what the PM knew of the tax issue and when.

Downing Street has said the issue was not raised by him with officials when he appointed his cabinet.

What will the inquiry investigate - just the tax, or his denials around it?

Criticism by Lord Evans, the chairman of Committee on Standards in Public Life about Nadhim Zahawi's ""apparent legal attempts to suppress the story"" is likely to get a mention too.

This issue is a particular nightmare for the PM, forced to defend keeping on a multi-millionaire during a cost of living squeeze and of course another story about personal taxes, when he has been under fire over his wife's tax status.

Tory MPs will be looking to the PM to be adept at turning the questions onto Labour - their union backers will surely get a mention, but it's set to be uncomfortable territory for the Conservatives.

But what does that actually mean?

Although only a metaphor for the dangers facing humanity, the clock is updated by those in the know about a range of risks.

The countdown is agreed on by experts at the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

This year the clock has moved forward due to the ""mounting dangers of the war in Ukraine"".

With the increase in nuclear threat, political tensions, climate change and illnesses, experts believe that this could be a defining moment in history.

The latest update describes 2023 as ""a time of unprecedented danger"".

What is the Doomsday Clock and how is it set?

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists - the creators of the clock - first launched the initiative in response to the threat of nuclear war in the 1940s.

Advertisement

After the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the Second World War, members of the Bulletin saw a need to help the public understand the scale of the nuclear threat to the existence of humanity.

To this day, the Bulletin's science and security board, made up of nuclear and climate experts, set the time for the clock. The board has done this since 1973, when it took over from Eugene Rabinowitch, Bulletin editor and disarmament campaigner.

The symbolism of the Doomsday Clock is powerful. If it were to strike midnight, it would mark the end of time and the theoretical point of annihilation for the human race.

The clock moves closer or further away from midnight based on how the experts on the board, plus academic colleagues and the Bulletin's sponsors - which include 13 Nobel laureates - read threats at a particular time around the globe.

Doomsday Clock moves closer to midnight as Ukraine war rages

Ukraine war - follow our latest coverage

What have scientists said?

The latest update to the clock is the most dire since its inception.

In a statement released by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on Tuesday, its experts said: ""Russia's thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons remind the world that escalation of the conflict by accident, intention, or miscalculation is a terrible risk.""

The statement added: ""The possibility that the conflict could spin out of anyone's control remains high.""

The scientists said the war has ""increased the risk of nuclear weapons use, raised the spectre of biological and chemical weapons use, hamstrung the world's response to climate change, and hampered international efforts to deal with other global concerns"".

Image: The Russia-Ukraine war has moved the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight

The Bulletin's warning continued: ""The invasion and annexation of Ukrainian territory have also violated international norms in ways that may embolden others to take actions that challenge previous understandings and threaten stability.

""In this time of unprecedented global danger, concerted action is required, and every second counts.""

How have people reacted on social media?

The Doomsday Clock is not without its critics.

Some say it's an arbitrary act of scaremongering, masquerading as a more precise warning.

As Derek Thompson wrote on Tuesday: ""The Doomsday Clock is so absurd. How are news organizations still treating this joke of false precision with any kind of reverence? It's like meteorologists solemnly and humourlessly reporting the results of Groundhog Day.""

However, others were more supportive of the concept. Another Twitter user, @harryhagopian, said the new time made sense to him as he was ""increasingly concerned"" about global security.

The Doomsday Clock's history

When it first began in 1947, the clock was set at seven minutes to midnight.

Artist Martyl Langsdorf came up with the idea of the clock and set the time to symbolise the dangers of nuclear confrontation, on the front cover of the Bulletin.

Since then it has been ticking away as political, nuclear and climate changes continued over the years, with experts revising the time up and down - mostly closer to midnight and its metaphor for total disaster.

There have been more reassuring years, though. In 1995 the clock was at 14 minutes to midnight, the safest reading in its history.

And there were ""positive strides"" in some years, such as the Paris climate agreement.

Ever since 1998, however, the hands of the clock have been at less than 10 minutes to midnight.

In 2020, scientists moved the hands of the clock forward to 100 seconds to midnight after the breakout of COVID-19.

Estate agents are going to want this and it's all about being prepared.

Get your taxes prepared if you are self-employed

Buying a house can be a little more complicated if you're self-employed, so you should make sure you have completed your latest personal tax return and have paid all outstanding taxes.

This means mortgage brokers will have all the information they need to submit your mortgage application on time, Mr Sidhu says.

Check how you have budgeted

""If you are serious about purchasing in the first quarter of the year, it's important that you have ensured you have budgeted accordingly, especially over the festive season,"" Mr Sidhu says.

Remember, lenders will be looking at your bank statements to make sure you are not over-commitment.

Double-check your paperwork and work with your broker

One of the most important things is to make sure you have your paperwork in order, including valid passports, a driving licence with your current address, and bank statements.

""Overall, working with your broker is the secret to getting through what can be a very stressful period. Your broker will help you through the process, and can establish what you can afford so you can play your property viewing carefully,"" Mr Sidhu says.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125113237/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-interest-rate-hike-expected-next-week-royal-mail-reveals-how-many-britons-are-now-re-gifting-or-selling-unwanted-xmas-gifts-12615118

Lisa Marie, a singer and the only child of rock and roll legend Elvis, died at the age of 54 after suffering a cardiac arrest at her home in Calabasas, California, earlier in January.

Two days before her death, she had appeared with her mother, Priscilla Presley, at the Golden Globes.

Following a memorial held at the weekend, her daughter, actress Riley Keough, has shared a picture in tribute to her mother on Instagram.

""I feel blessed to have a photo of the last time I saw my beautiful mama,"" she wrote. ""Grateful [actress] @georgieflores took this.""

Presley is survived by Riley and her mother, and twin daughters Finley and Harper Lockwood. Her son, Benjamin Keough, took his own life in 2020, aged 27.

Sarah, Duchess of York, Axl Rose, Alanis Morissette and The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan were among the mourners and performers at her memorial service, held at Graceland Mansion in Memphis, Tennessee.

For years, the sprawling estate has been the destination for those paying tribute to Elvis, but following her death the iconic home became the venue for those saying a final farewell to his daughter.

At the ceremony, Riley's husband Ben Smith-Petersen, an actor and stuntman, read an emotional tribute she had written.

Part of the letter read: ""I hope I can love my daughter the way you loved me, the way you loved my brother and my sisters.

""Thank you for giving me strength, my heart, my empathy, my courage, my sense of humour, my manners, my temper, my wildness, my tenacity. I'm a product of your heart, my sisters are a product of your heart, my brother is a product of your heart.""

Elvis is also buried at Graceland, as are his parents, his paternal grandmother, and Benjamin Keough.

Lisa Marie's final resting place is next to her son and near to her father, who died from heart failure aged 42 when she was aged just nine.

The three machines in the country's second-largest city Yokohama offer customers whale steak, whale bacon and whale sashimi.

The prices range from around 1,000 yen (£6) to 3,000 yen (£19) and contain whale mainly caught in Japan.

Image: Pictures of canned whale meat are displayed on one of the machines

Hideki Tokoro, president of the whaling firm Kyodo Senpaku, said he hopes the ""unmanned store"" revives sales of the food which has been shunned by many shops.

""There are many major supermarkets that are afraid of being harassed by anti-whaling groups so they won't use whale. So there are many people who want to eat whale but can't,"" he said.

""Therefore, we are opening stores with the thought that we can provide a place where those people can eat.""

Some passers-by near the store said they would be open to eating whale but they wouldn't make a special effort.

""I wouldn't go out of my way to come (buy it). I usually eat chicken,"" said Urara Inamoto, a 28-year-old customer service worker.

The company has recently set up two similar outlets in Tokyo and plans to open a fourth in the western city of Osaka in February.

It also hopes to grow to 100 locations in the next five years.

But while the government maintains eating whale is an important part of Japanese culture, consumption has dramatically declined in recent decades.

Image: The official opening of the Yokohama shop

Just 1,000 tonnes of whale meat was eaten in Japan in 2021, down from 233,000 tonnes at the peak of its popularity in 1962.

In comparison, consumption of chicken and beef totalled 2.6 million tonnes and 1.27 million tonnes respectively.

Conservationists have criticised the vending machines.

Katrin Matthes, head of Japan policy for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said: ""Most Japanese people have never ever tried it. So how can it be something you call a nationwide culture if nobody's really participating in it?""

The International Whaling Commission (IWC) - a global organisation that oversees whale conservation - banned commercial whaling in 1986 after some species came close to extinction.

However, Japan continued whaling for what it said were research purposes. The country later pulled out of the IWC and resumed commercial whaling in 2019.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125123243/http://news.sky.com/story/japan-whale-meat-sold-in-vending-machines-as-campaigners-criticise-decision-12794980

The piece of TV memorabilia, that found fame on Noel's House Party, is being sold by eBay user blobby01, and with a day to go until the auction ends, the costume has reached a whopping £61,501.

Described by the seller as in need of a new home, the costume is more than 25 years old.

It was made by the BBC's costume supplier, but the show was cancelled before it could be delivered.

The seller wrote: ""Neither the broadcaster or the BBC's production team wanted it - so it sat in my office until a move meant it came home with me some years ago.""

Due to the costume's age, and the material, the suit is now deemed ""less suitable to be worn"".

Some extra attention is also needed to fix a crack in one of the plastic eyes and to secure the character's iconic bright yellow polka-dot bow tie.

""Overall it's not too bad for its age - but there is visible creasing and dust to the covering and some areas require a drop of glue to make good,"" the seller added.

Sadly the sale of the suit does not include a voice device, which enabled the character to say the word ""blobby"", and can only be used for personal display use.

463;Scottish Water apologises after burst water main in Milngavie cut off 250,000 customers and cracked road;Wednesday 25 January 2023 11:56, UK;[];['glasgow', 'scotland'];['cracked', 'scottish', 'water', 'pipe', 'road', 'burst', 'customers', 'apologises', 'mains', 'main', 'open', 'glasgow', 'milngavie', 'cut', 'affected', 'city'];"Around 250,000 customers in Scotland were left without water after a major pipe burst.

The pipe burst in Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire, on Tuesday afternoon and led to flooding in the area.

The force of the 36-inch mains bursting split Auchenhowie Road open, and children at the Lullaby Lane nursery had to take shelter in the nearby Rangers Training Centre.

Restoration works have been carried out but Scottish Water has warned there could be some ongoing interruptions and discolouration to normal supply.

The utilities company said around 100,000 properties were affected across East Dunbartonshire and parts of Glasgow.

Supplies for customers in Glasgow city centre and the Knightswood, Yoker, Scotstoun, Partick, Kelvinside, Tradeston and Ibrox areas of the city were also interrupted.

Fans attending Lewis Capaldi's gig at the OVO Hydro faced long queues after the venue was forced to close some toilets due to the water shortage.

Hydro bosses said the issue was beyond their control but the ""safety and comfort"" of its customers took priority.

The water supply had been reconnected for most affected homes and businesses by Tuesday night.

Those that are experiencing discoloured water have been advised by the company that it is the natural lying sediment within the mains that has been disturbed and that it should clear by gently running the cold-water kitchen tap.

White water - caused by air in the water - will settle within the next day or two, Scottish Water added.

Glasgow Road and part of Auchenhowie Road remain closed with local diversions in place.

464;Earth's inner core may have stopped spinning as part of seven-decade cycle, say scientists;Wednesday 25 January 2023 11:51, UK;[];['earthquakes'];['say', 'rest', 'research', 'spinning', 'waves', 'sevendecade', 'core', 'earths', 'scientists', 'study', 'inner', 'stopped', 'surface', 'cycle'];"The spinning core at the centre of Earth may have recently stopped rotating, relative to the surface, as part of a seven-decade cycle, scientists have said.

A study said the inner core, which is the size of Pluto, could have stopped spinning around 2009.

This could be possible because the inner core is mostly a solid ball of iron floating in a liquid outer core, so its rotation is not necessarily tied to that of the rest of the planet.

Scientists also said the inner core may have started to spin in the opposite direction instead.

If so, something is probably happening to the magnetic and gravitational forces that drive the core's rotation.

The research could help increase the understanding in how changes to the core can impact things on the Earth's surface, such as the length of the day and navigation.

Seismic waves from earthquakes which have passed through the planet's inner core were analysed as part of the study.

The tracking of the waves found there had been ""little change over the past decade"" in paths that previously showed ""significant temporal changes"".

The process is part of an ""approximately seven-decade oscillation"", the study reported.

The scientists from Peking University in China believe ""this globally consistent pattern suggests that inner-core rotation has recently paused"".

They wrote: ""We compared this recent pattern to the Alaskan seismic records of South Sandwich Islands doublets going back to 1964 and it seems to be associated with a gradual turning-back of the inner core as part of an approximately seven-decade oscillation, with another turning point in the early 1970s.""

Their observations, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, provide further evidence for ""dynamic interactions"" between the Earth's different layers which can influence the magnetic field and changes on the surface.

The Earth's core is said to be a solid ball which has a radius of around 800 miles and a temperature similar to the surface of the sun.

Previous research has shown the core is separated from the rest of the planet by a liquid metal outer core, allowing it to spin independently and at a different pace than the rest of the Earth.

Richard Masters, 52, was arrested in Spain on Friday, though his co-accused Vladislav Osipov remains at large.

The pair, charged separately, reportedly helped Russian-Cypriot oligarch Viktor Vekselberg evade US sanctions.

The scheme was allegedly facilitated through Mr Vekselberg's 255ft yacht Tango, which is thought to be worth $90m (£73m).

Image: The yacht called Tango was renamed 'Fanta'. Pic: AP

The US Department of Justice (DoJ) claimed Masters ran a yacht company in Palma de Mallorca and managed Tango after initial sanctions were imposed on Mr Vekselberg in 2018.

Masters allegedly called Mr Vekselberg's yacht ""the Fanta"" to hide thousands of dollars from banks that would ultimately benefit the oligarch.

Image: Mr Vekselberg allegedly benefited from hundreds and thousands of dollars from the scheme. Pic:AP

It is claimed Masters and Russian-Swiss Osipov masked Mr Vekselberg's involvement with the yacht, with Osipov using shell companies to hide his ownership.

The US Department of Justice (DoJ) said both have been charged with multiple offences: Conspiracy to defraud the US and to commit offences against the US; violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA); and money laundering.

Mr Vekselberg faced US sanctions in April 2018 following Russia's annexation of Crimea.

Tougher measures were imposed on him in March last year after Mr Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

The UK, Australia and Poland also seized Mr Vekselberg's assets in March, imposing travel bans, with the DoJ seizing Tango in Spain a month after.

US attorney Matthew Graves said: ""Facilitators of sanctions evasion enable the oligarchs supporting Vladimir Putin's regime to flout US law.

""The United States will not allow its financial institutions and persons to be manipulated or defrauded for the purposes of benefitting those supporting an illegal war.""

Andrew Adams, director of the Task Force KleptoCapture department, said Masters had to face the ""consequences"" of his actions.

He explained that corporations and executives ""have a choice"" of either fighting against ""corruption, sanctions violations, and money laundering"" or choosing the path of the accused.

""They can as Osipov and Masters are alleged to have done, attempt to shield themselves and their clients behind a veil of fraud,"" he added.

So Nadhim Zahawi has cleared one major hurdle that many thought he wouldn't in his battle to survive: he's made it through to high noon and Prime Minister's Questions.

After Rishi Sunak's erroneous claim at last week's PMQs that Mr Zahawi had answered all the questions about his tax in full and there was nothing more to add, there were plenty of grounds for believing he'd go in the minutes leading up to this week's session.

No sign of the soon-to-be ex-Tory chairman in the chamber, predictably.

Further evidence that the scandal engulfing him is making it impossible for him to carry out his job.

When Sir Keir Starmer tackles Mr Sunak, the PM begins with the rather lame excuse that the tax deal was done before he became prime minister and nothing was raised with him.

Blaming the civil service mandarins and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case in particular? Sounded like it. A ""nothing to do with me, guv"" excuse.

But then Mr Sunak goes on the attack. He claims the easy thing to have done would be to ""resolve"" the issue before PMQs, but he believes in ""due process"".

Then he really goes for the Labour leader.

He talks about his own principles and points out that when he disagreed with Boris Johnson he resigned, unlike Sir Keir who sat alongside Jeremy Corbyn for four years of antisemitism and Labour supporting the UK's opponents. Strong stuff.

Sir Keir's one good line is to sneer: ""Is he starting to wonder if this job is too big for him?""

Surly not a reference to the PM's slight, 5ft 7in stature? Heightist? Sizeist?

Rishi Sunak is being urged to scrap plans for a new Bill of Rights by an influential cross-party committee, which said it would create additional barriers that make it harder for people to enforce their fundamental freedoms.

Politics live: Rishi Sunak quizzed over Zahawi tax affairs in tough PMQs

Rather than creating a strong new legal framework and protecting parliament's sovereignty, as the government has argued, the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) said the proposed legislation appeared to be designed to ""tip the balance"" in favour of the state when facing allegations of human rights violations.

The likely result of this would be that more people would need to go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to settle their cases, and that more adverse judgments are likely to be made against the UK.

""The government should not proceed with this bill,"" the committee said.

""It weakens rights protections, it undermines the universality of rights, it shows disregard for our international legal obligations; it creates legal uncertainty and hinders effective enforcement; it will lead to an increased caseload in Strasbourg; and will damage our international reputation as guardians of human rights.""

The proposed legislation is intended to scrap and replace the Human Rights Act, which enshrines in law the basic rights and freedoms everyone in the UK is entitled to.

It was originally introduced under Boris Johnson by Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary Dominic Raab only to be dropped by Liz Truss when she took the reigns in Downing Street and sacked Mr Raab.

It was revived when Mr Sunak entered Number 10 and Mr Raab was reappointed to his previous role, although when he appeared before the Commons Liaison Committee last month the prime minister refused to commit to a parliamentary timetable to bring it into law.

The government says the bill is designed to ""help prevent trivial human rights claims from wasting judges' time"" and to make it clear UK courts do not always need to follow the decisions of European courts.

However, committee chair Joanna Cherry said: ""There is such little appetite for these reforms and the impact is likely to be so damaging to human rights protection in the UK it may be more sensible to scrap the Bill in its entirety.""

The committee noted there appeared to be little wider support for the proposed changes, with victims of violence against women, care home residents, and those whose family members have lost their life due to the actions of the police or other state actors among those raising objections in a public consultation.

The bill would also impact on the requirement on public bodies to investigate injustices that have led to landmark legal rulings - such as the inquests into the Hillsborough disaster, the committee said.

The government has defended the legislation in light of the report, insisting it will strengthen freedom of speech and inject ""a healthy dose of common sense to the system and ending abuse of our laws"".

A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: ""The government was elected on a manifesto that committed to updating the Human Rights Act to ensure there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government - that is what we are doing.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125130327/http://news.sky.com/story/overhaul-of-human-rights-laws-would-weaken-uk-courts-and-should-be-scrapped-mps-warn-12794984

On Monday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak asked new ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus to assess whether the cabinet minister breached the ministerial code with the HMRC settlement he made while he was chancellor.

""Clearly in this case there are questions that need answering,"" he told reporters.

Mr Zahawi has said he is ""clearly being smeared"" over questions about his tax affairs - and that he did not ""benefit"" from an ""offshore trust"".

Mr Sunak is under increasing pressure to remove Mr Zahawi from his senior cabinet post.

But what do we know about the matter so far?

Who is Nadhim Zahawi?

Mr Zahawi, the chairman of the Conservative Party, was previously an aide to Conservative peer Lord Archer and - with another aide Stephan Shakespeare - founded polling company YouGov at the turn of the millennium.

In 2010, setting his sights firmly back on politics, he became MP for Stratford-upon-Avon.

He secured his first junior minister post - education minister - in 2018, but became a household name after COVID broke out in the UK and he was appointed by former PM Boris Johnson as vaccine minister.

The performance propelled him to cabinet and in September 2021, he took his first secretary of state post, back in the Department for Education.

He was propelled further to chancellor in the dying days of Mr Johnson's premiership after the resignation of Rishi Sunak.

Mr Zahawi made an unsuccessful bid to become PM following Mr Johnson's removal - losing out to Liz Truss - but was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

He became chairman of the Tory Party just weeks later when Ms Truss's premiership came crashing down and Mr Sunak gained the keys to Number 10.

What is the controversy about?

In January 2023, The Sun On Sunday published a report claiming Mr Zahawi had paid a seven-figure sum to settle a dispute with HMRC over the sales of his YouGov shares.

The shares, worth an estimated £27m, were held by Balshore Investments, a company registered offshore in Gibraltar linked to Mr Zahawi's family.

Sky News understands that, as part of a settlement with HMRC, Mr Zahawi paid a penalty to the tax collector.

The exact size of the settlement has not been disclosed, but it is reported to be an estimated £4.8m, including a 30% penalty.

By Monday, Mr Sunak had ordered a potentially far-reaching investigation into Mr Zahawi to be conducted by the PM's new ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus.

Sir Laurie is expected to focus on whether the cabinet minister breached the ministerial code with the estimated £4.8m HMRC settlement he made while he was chancellor, but it could extend to his prior tax arrangement and whether he lied to the media.

It is unclear what the prime minister knew about Mr Zahawi's dealings with the tax office when he appointed him to his cabinet in October.

Sources close to Mr Zahawi have said he is ""absolutely not standing down"".

What has Zahawi said?

Last July, it was reported that HMRC was investigating Mr Zahawi's tax affairs - but a spokesperson for him at the time said he was ""not aware of any formal investigation by HMRC"" and insisted ""his taxes are fully paid and up to date"".

The next day, allegations arose that concerns had been raised by officials over Mr Zahawi's tax affairs before his appointment as a minister in Mr Johnson's cabinet.

When the issue of his tax affairs came up in an interview with Sky News as Mr Zahawi prepared to launch his leadership bid, Mr Zahawi said: ""I was clearly being smeared.

""I was being told that the Serious Fraud Office, that the National Crime Agency, that HMRC are looking into me. I'm not aware of this.""

It is unclear when Mr Zahawi first knew about the probe by HMRC, but his allies have said he told the Cabinet Office's propriety and ethics team about the matter before his appointment.

Over the weekend, Mr Zahawi said HMRC concluded there had been a ""careless and not deliberate"" error in the way the founders' shares, which he had allocated to his father, had been treated.

In a statement on Monday, following the PM's announcement of an investigation into the matter, he added: ""I am confident I acted properly throughout and look forward to answering any and all specific questions in a formal setting to Sir Laurie.""

Mr Zahawi has not confirmed how much his penalty amounted to or the value of the overall settlement with HMRC.

What has the prime minister said?

The prime minister has ordered his ethics adviser to investigate whether Mr Zahawi broke ministerial rules over the estimated £4.8m bill.

A week ago, Mr Sunak told MPs that Mr Zahawi had ""already addressed the matter in full"" - but Downing Street subsequently revealed the PM had not been aware that the Conservative Party chairman had paid a penalty to HMRC as part of the settlement.

Mr Sunak admitted there are ""questions that need answering"" as the inquiry was launched, and it is unclear what he knew when appointing Mr Zahawi to the cabinet-attending role.

Downing Street subsequently suggested Mr Sunak did not know last week that Mr Zahawi had paid a reported 30% penalty to HMRC.

And the PM said the advice he received ahead of appointing Mr Zahawi as party chair in October was that there was ""no reason"" not to.

Mr Sunak has so far resisted growing calls to remove Mr Zahawi from his current post.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 7:18 'Zahawi should stand aside', says Tory peer Lord Hayward

Who has called for him to go?

Former minister Caroline Nokes said there were ""too many unanswered questions"" over the tax row as she called for Mr Zahawi to ""stand aside and let the investigation run its course"".

Speaking to Sky News on Tuesday, Lord Hayward agreed that the Tory Party chairman should think about ""standing aside"" while parliament's ethics watchdog investigates his tax affairs.

""We don't know what the timescales are for the inquiry, and I think that's key,"" he said.

""I think he should be considering whether he stands aside for the period of the inquiry.""

But Home Office minister Chris Philp said on Monday that Mr Zahawi should be treated as ""innocent until proven guilty"" and it is ""reasonable"" for him to continue as party chairman.

""The investigation has been launched by the prime minister; that is the right thing to do. It will get to the bottom of this and then the prime minister will make his decision,"" he said.

""But I don't think it is fair to jump to any conclusions before the investigation has concluded.""

Labour said Mr Zahawi's admitted carelessness should see him removed from government.

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy told Sky News: ""When you've been chancellor of the exchequer and you said you've been careless despite the fact that offshore trusts have been set up in Gibraltar, I'm sorry, you really ought to resign or be sacked.""

What does this mean for the PM?

The Zahawi tax affairs saga formed one of two controversies Mr Sunak has been forced to confront this week, with questions also being raised over the decision to appoint Richard Sharp as BBC chairman while he reportedly helped former Number 10 incumbent Mr Johnson secure a loan of up to £800,000.

The PM has also distanced himself from this allegation, saying the chairman's appointment was made by ""one of my predecessors"".

But these two incidents add to what has been a turbulent first few months in Number 10 for Mr Sunak.

On his first day as PM in October, Mr Sunak vowed to restore ""integrity and accountability"" to government - a promise which has now been called into question by a series of events.

A few days after entering Number 10, the PM was forced to defend re-appointing Suella Braverman as home secretary days after she quit over data breaches.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the new PM of doing a ""grubby deal"" with Ms Braverman to secure her support in the Tory leadership contest.

An independent probe was also launched into the conduct of another cabinet member - Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab - after he was subject to multiple complaints of bullying.

Mr Sunak initially stood by the justice secretary - who he reappointed to the role in the autumn - but eventually bowed to pressure to allow the formal probe.

On top of this, the prime minister received a second police fine last week, this time for failing to wear a seatbelt.

Tate and his brother Tristan are being investigated over allegations of sexual assault and exploitation.

Today the pair were taken to the Bucharest headquarters of the organisation that tackles organised crime and terrorism, known as Diicot.

Responding to a journalist's questions as he arrived at the offices, British-US citizen Andrew Tate, 36, said ""the case file is completely empty"" and ""there is no justice in Romania"".

He also said: ""They know we have done nothing wrong.""

Tate denied hurting any girls.

Tristan Tate, 34, was heard saying: ""For my money. That is why I am in jail. I have money that they are going to steal.""

Romanian prosecutors have been searching for evidence on Andrew Tate's mobile phones and laptops as part of an organised crime and human trafficking probe, said Diicot spokesperson Ramona Bolla.

Last Friday, a judge decided the pair must remain in prison for a further 30 days while police investigate.

After the Tates were arrested in December along with two Romanian women, Diicot said in a statement that it had identified six victims who were subjected to ""acts of physical violence and mental coercion"".

The agency added that the victims were lured on the pretence of love, and later intimidated.

It alleged how the victims were kept under surveillance and pressured into engaging in pornographic acts for substantial financial gains.

A lawyer for the brothers, Iona Gliga, said last Friday that he considered the ruling by a judge that they stay in detention until February as ""totally unjustified"".

""Only an hour ago, the session was closed and the file has 20 volumes,"" Mr Gliga said.

""I find it very hard to believe that someone has the physical capacity to study the file in such a short time, as only yesterday it reached the tribunal.""

Andrew Tate, who has reportedly lived in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech.

The 42-year-old - who co-created the Adult Swim animated series and voices the two title characters - has been charged over an incident involving an ex-girlfriend. He denies the allegations.

Rick and Morty has aired for six seasons on Cartoon Network as part of its Adult Swim night-time programming block, and has been renewed for a seventh.

A statement from Adult Swim said the popular US cartoon would continue despite the writer's absence.

A statement released online by Adult Swim on Tuesday said: ""Adult Swim has ended its association with Justin Roiland.

""Rick and Morty will continue. The talented and dedicated crew are hard at work on season seven.""

A criminal complaint filed by prosecutors in May 2020, and seen by NBC News, charged Roiland with corporal injury and false imprisonment by menace, fraud, and violence or deceit against the woman, who he was living with at the time.

The woman was not identified in court documents. Roiland has pleaded not guilty.

The charges concern an incident in January of 2020 and Roiland was charged in May of that year. However, the charges apparently went unnoticed by media outlets until NBC News reported them.

Further documents seen by NBC News show Roiland was arrested and released on a $50,000 (£41,000) bond in August 2020 before returning to court in October 2020.

So Nadhim Zahawi has cleared one major hurdle that many thought he wouldn't in his battle to survive: he's made it through to high noon and Prime Minister's Questions.

After Rishi Sunak's erroneous claim at last week's PMQs that Mr Zahawi had answered all the questions about his tax in full and there was nothing more to add, there were plenty of grounds for believing he'd go in the minutes leading up to this week's session.

No sign of the soon-to-be ex-Tory chairman in the chamber, predictably.

Further evidence that the scandal engulfing him is making it impossible for him to carry out his job.

When Sir Keir Starmer tackles Mr Sunak, the PM begins with the rather lame excuse that the tax deal was done before he became prime minister and nothing was raised with him.

Blaming the civil service mandarins and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case in particular? Sounded like it. A ""nothing to do with me, guv"" excuse.

But then Mr Sunak goes on the attack. He claims the easy thing to have done would be to ""resolve"" the issue before PMQs, but he believes in ""due process"".

Then he really goes for the Labour leader.

He talks about his own principles and points out that when he disagreed with Boris Johnson he resigned, unlike Sir Keir who sat alongside Jeremy Corbyn for four years of antisemitism and Labour supporting the UK's opponents. Strong stuff.

Sir Keir's one good line is to sneer: ""Is he starting to wonder if this job is too big for him?""

Surly not a reference to the PM's slight, 5ft 7in stature? Heightist? Sizeist?

476;Transgender rapist in women's prison in Scotland raises safety fears, says Joanna Cherry MP;Wednesday 25 January 2023 13:09, UK;[];['glasgow', 'prisons', 'scotland', 'crime'];['rapist', 'women', 'fears', 'convicted', 'raises', 'womens', 'transgender', 'prison', 'joanna', 'recognition', 'mp', 'held', 'rights', 'scotland', 'gender', 'safety', 'bryson'];"A convicted transgender rapist should not be held in a women's prison as it raises safety concerns, an SNP MP has said.

Isla Bryson, 31, was this week found guilty of raping two women while she was a man.

Bryson attacked one victim in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, in 2016 and another in Drumchapel, Glasgow, in 2019.

During the trial, the High Court in Glasgow heard that Bryson now identifies as a transgender woman and was previously named Adam Graham.

Giving evidence, Bryson claimed she knew she was transgender at the age of four but did not make the decision to transition until she was 29.

She is currently taking hormones and seeking surgery to complete gender reassignment.

Image: Bryson had denied the charges and claimed any sex was consensual

Following her conviction, Bryson was remanded in custody pending sentencing next month.

It is understood she is currently being held at Cornton Vale women's prison in Stirling.

'I think we should be talking about these cases'

SNP MP Joanna Cherry, chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, said she is ""very concerned"" about the safety of the women prisoners at Cornton Vale.

Speaking to Times Radio, Ms Cherry said: ""To many people, it will look like this convicted rapist has gamed the system in order to try and garner sympathy, and to end up in a women's prison. And I think a lot of people will be shocked by that.

""So I think we should be talking about these cases. And women in prison are very vulnerable. Many women in prison have themselves been abused, and have suffered injuries over the years. And so they're particularly vulnerable. And perhaps some people would say nobody really cares about prisoners.

""But the point about human rights is that they're universal, and they apply to everyone. So I'm very concerned about the safety of women prisoners, with whom a convicted rapist has been placed.""

Image: Joanna Cherry MP said that Bryson should be held in a men's prison

Ms Cherry thinks Bryson should be held in a men's prison.

Her comments come after the UK government blocked Holyrood's controversial Gender Recognition Reform (GRR) Bill which would speed up and simplify the process for trans people to obtain a gender recognition certificate (GRC).

Bryson first appeared in court as Adam Graham in 2019 and was later named in court papers the following year - around the time she decided to transition - as Isla Annie Bryson.

Bryson, from Clydebank, had denied the charges and claimed any sex was consensual.

Addressing Bryson in the dock on Tuesday, judge Lord Scott said: ""You have been convicted by the jury of two extremely serious charges; those being charges of rape.""

He told her the crimes were ""considerable"" and that ""a significant sentence is inevitable"".

The Scottish government said the Scottish Prison Service uses ""comprehensive individualised risk assessments"" to inform decisions such as the placement of prisoners, and ""not the basis of a Gender Recognition Certificate"".

A spokesperson added: ""The Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill does not change this process in any way.""

A Scottish Prison Service spokesperson said: ""Decisions by the SPS as to the most appropriate location to accommodate transgender people are made on an individualised basis, informed by a multi-disciplinary assessment of both risk and need.

""Such decisions seek to protect both the wellbeing and rights of the individual as well as the welfare and rights of others around them, including staff, in order to achieve an outcome that balances risks and promotes the safety of all.

At PMQs, the Labour leader asked if ""any politician who seeks to avoid taxes they owe in the country is not fit to be in charge"" of the UK finances - a reference to Mr Zahawi settling a seven-figure sum with HMRC - including a penalty - while he was chancellor.

""We all know why the prime minister was reluctant to ask his party chair questions about family finances and tax avoidance,"" Sir Keir said - an apparent dig at the PM's own tax affairs previously coming under scrutiny.

Politics live: Some Tories say 'game over' for Zahawi

""But his failure to sack him when the whole country can see what's going on shows how hopelessly weak he is - a prime minister overseeing chaos, overwhelmed at every turn.""

Referencing problems with public services, Sir Keir added: ""He can't say when ambulances will get to heart attack victims again. He can't say when the prisons system will keep streets safe again. He can't even deal with tax avoiders in his own cabinet.

""Is he starting to wonder if this job is just too big for him?""

Mr Sunak accused Sir Keir of being a ""hypocrite"" for seeking to get him to sack his colleague rather than abide by the due process of the parliamentary investigation into Mr Zahawi's tax affairs, which he said Labour had called for.

The PM said: ""Of course, the politically expedient thing to do would be for me to have said that this matter must be resolved by Wednesday at noon.

""But I believe in proper due process.""

Mr Sunak added that he did not know about the investigation into Mr Zahawi's taxes when he appointed him to his cabinet in October.

On Sir Keir's attack line he said: ""It's simple political opportunism and everyone can see through it.""

Questions have swirled around Mr Zahawi's tax affairs since the summer when claims emerged that he was being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, the National Crime Agency and HM Revenue & Customs, accusations he deemed a ""smear"".

The issue made headlines 10 days ago after The Sun on Sunday published an article claiming he had paid a seven-figure sum to the tax office to settle a dispute over the sale of his YouGov shares.

After a week of saying nothing more than his taxes ""were and are fully up to date and are paid in the UK"" - and publicly receiving the backing of Mr Sunak in last week's PMQs - Mr Zahawi released a statement saying he had paid what HMRC said ""was due"" after it ""disagreed about the exact allocation"" of the shares.

The Tory chairman said this was a ""careless and not a deliberate error"" and did not confirm if any penalty was also levied. But Sky News understands that as part of the settlement with HMRC - thought to be around £4.8m - the chairman paid a penalty.

Mr Sunak has now asked his ethics adviser to carry out an inquiry into whether Mr Zahawi breached the ministerial code, and the investigation could extend into his prior tax arrangements and whether he lied to the media.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125133311/http://news.sky.com/story/pmqs-sir-keir-starmer-attacks-hopelessly-weak-rishi-sunak-for-failing-to-sack-nadhim-zahawi-12795017

Germany has been stuck in an excruciating position. On the one hand for clear historical reasons it does not want to be seen taking the lead against Russia. On the other it happens to produce and supply a weapon that could prove crucial in Ukraine's war against Putin.



That at least is how German officials have explained their predicament over the Leopard 2 battle tank. Their critics in the past week's furious tank debate say that is an excuse. It is high time Germany acts its geopolitical shoe size they say, at the forefront of European nations. With its economic prowess and position in Europe come responsibilities and they should stop shirking them.

Either way Germany's decision to send Leopards, finally and agonisingly reached is a big deal. It will be make a big difference perhaps decisively in a military sense. But geopolitically it sends a clear message albeit belatedly to Putin the West remains united and determined to stop him whatever his clumsy attempts at nuclear blackmail.

Germans are uneasy about military aggression because of their Nazi past. Some have worried about the idea of German tanks rolling east again to kill Russians as they did in the Second World War.

They have also been proud of their policy of Ostpolitik, looking east, normalising relations with Russia and the role that played in ending the Cold War.

But critics say they have been in a muddle. The tanks are being sent not to aggress but to defend. And the last year has proven Ostpolitik a relic of the past or at least in need of an urgent overhaul. Their chancellor Olaf Scholz said as much in a speech when he said Germany has reached a Zeitenwende or historic turning point.

Berlin says it did not want to be seen taking the lead over tanks and has only acted now the US has agreed to send them too. But Britain had already taken the initiative sending Challengers.

Rather than being seen as a team player acting on consensus the last week has seen Germany dragging its heels apparently confused and unsure about its role in the coalition. That is unfortunate because in reality Germany has given huge amounts to help Ukraine.

Rescuers braved wind-whipped waters to continue the search for 22 crew members after a 6,551-ton cargo ship sank early on Wednesday.

At least two have died and 14 have been rescued, nine of which remain unconscious, according to South Korean officials.

The ship sank around 93 miles (150km) south of Jeju island. The Japanese coast guard said the water in the area remained rough with a temperature of 14C (57F).

Around 540 flights were scheduled in and out of Jeju on Wednesday alone, mostly to take passengers back to mainland cities.

The island has seen more than 19cm (7.5 inches) of snow since Tuesday morning, after an estimated 40,000 visited the island for Lunar New Year celebrations.

Southern mainland cities and towns such as Gwangju and Gangjin reported around 10 to 12cm (3.9 to 4.7in) and more than 70cm (27.5in) of snow fell on the eastern island of Ulleung.

Heavy snow is expected to reach greater Seoul from late Wednesday to Thursday afternoon, according to the Safety Ministry.

While South Korea's air traffic returned to normal in Jeju, thousands of people using train services in western Japan were forced to stay overnight in carriages or stations, while vehicles on major roads across the country were left stranded, Kyodo News reported.

Cold weather warnings were also issued in North Korea.

Temperatures in Pyongyang were forecast to dip to minus -19C (-2.2F) on Wednesday morning. Authorities reportedly called for ""thorough measures"" to prevent economic damage.

Record low temperatures in China

Chaos in Japan and South Korea follows temperatures dropping to their lowest ever in parts of northern China, with -53C (-63F) recorded in one city.

State broadcaster CCTV said a weather station in Mohe, in Heilongjiang province, logged the record low on Sunday, breaking the city's previous record of -52C (-61F) in 1969.

Antonio Neill admitted a charge of sending an offensive message at Newcastle Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.

After the judge told the 24-year-old he would need to return for sentencing, Neill said he was ""disgusted"" and ""sorry"" for what he had done and wanted to ""become a better person"".

Police launched an investigation last October after Toney shared an image of an abusive message he had received on his Twitter account.

Officers treated the incident as a hate crime and traced the message to an address in North Shields, North Tyneside.

While the message was not read out in court, District Judge Paul Currer described it as ""exceptionally offensive"" and said it contained ""racial overtones"".

He added that he considered the matter to be ""very serious"" and adjourned sentencing until a separate, violent offence has been dealt with at the crown court.

Earlier, the defence had told the magistrates' court that Neill was ""extremely remorseful"" and had been drinking a ""significant amount"" of alcohol at the time.

The court also heard he was living away from his family at the time, bailed to an area where he did not know people, and ""behaved in a way he would never dream of acting"".

Neill's family had tried to extend an apology to Brentford even before the police became involved.

483;Rupert Murdoch abandons bid to reunite News Corp and Fox Corp;Wednesday 25 January 2023 13:43, UK;[];[];['proposed', 'rupert', 'son', 'withdrawing', 'proposal', 'murdoch', 'corp', 'shareholders', 'abandons', 'potential', 'reunite', 'bid', 'fox'];"A proposed reunion of two parts of Rupert Murdoch's empire has been abandoned by the media tycoon.

The 91-year old and his son Lachlan had floated the idea of bringing together News Corp, the US company behind the Wall Street Journal, Harper Collins and The Times newspaper, and Fox News owner Fox Corp.

The two companies were split in 2013 in a move designed to draw a line between the publishing businesses, which was struggling at the time, and its entertainment division.

The board of News Corp said last year it had formed a committee to independently assess whether the reunification of the two businesses would be in shareholders' interests.

Several top investors had since spoken out against the idea, suggesting it could have undervalued News Corp.

The Murdoch family controls about 40% of the entities.

The proposed tie-up was perceived, in some quarters, as potential succession planning by Murdoch Sr to consolidate power behind his son, the Fox chief, though that prospect was dismissed as ""absurd"" by the company last November.

News Corp said: ""The company's board of directors received a letter from K Rupert Murdoch withdrawing the proposal to explore a potential combination of News Corp and Fox Corporation.

""In withdrawing the proposal, Mr Murdoch indicated that he and Lachlan K Murdoch have determined that a combination is not optimal for shareholders of News Corp and Fox at this time.""

484;Politics news - latest: 'Opportunity missed' by Keir Starmer as Rishi Sunak comes out fighting on Nadhim Zahawi at PMQs;;[];['live'];['mr', 'labour', 'questions', 'nadhim', 'sir', 'tax', 'sunak', 'pmqs', 'politics', 'latest', 'keirs', 'starmer', 'opportunity', 'zahawi', 'zahawis', 'missed', 'leader', 'rishi'];"Opportunity missed by Starmer as PM comes out fighting after lame start

Did Sir Keir Starmer miss an open goal in his attack on Nadhim Zahawi's tax affairs at Prime Minister’s Questions?

With the whole of Westminster licking their lips in anticipation of a ferocious or forensic - or both - onslaught from the Labour leader, he surprisingly chose to open his questions by raising the death of Zara Aleena, a trainee lawyer killed by a ""violent, racist, woman-hating thug"".

A serious issue indeed. But was it really a matter for the prime minister to answer?

Sir Keir's attack on Rishi Sunak over what he knew and when about the Zahawi tax scandal would have been more potent if he'd devoted all of his six questions to the fate of the almost certainly doomed Tory chairman.

The Labour leader did indeed refer to the answer Mr Sunak gave in PMQs last week, when he told the Labour MP Alex Sobel that Mr Zahawi had answered questions about his taxes ""in full"" and there was nothing more to add.

But he repeated the PM's words almost in passing, rather than dissecting them and contrasting them with Mr Zahawi's statement on Saturday that he'd made a ""careless but not deliberate"" error and admitting he was in dispute with HMRC after all.

There was no mention either of Mr Zahawi's claim, in an interview with Kay Burley on Sky News last July, that the tax questions were nothing more than a smear. Another opportunity missed by the Labour leader.

And Mr Sunak gleefully pointed out, quite rightly, that Labour had been demanding precisely the sort of inquiry that he had now launched.

But the PM's best counter-attack against the Labour leader was when he declared that he stood by his values and principles, having resigned when he disagreed with Boris Johnson, unlike Sir Keir, who served under Jeremy Corbyn for four years, when ""antisemitism ran rife"" in the Labour Party, he claimed.

An interesting comparison between Mr Johnson and Corbyn. And one which BoJo's adoring fans will be furious about. But it helped make Mr Sunak's point.

Sir Keir's best line was when he asked Mr Sunak to consider whether the job of PM was ""too big for him"".

A variation on the Clement Attlee put-down to a sacked minister - ""Not up to it, old boy"" perhaps?

But it was probably Sir Keir's only wounding attack line.

After a lame start, when Mr Sunak said the Zahawi tax issue was nothing to do with him, since the issue was raised before he became PM and suggested it was all the fault of Whitehall mandarins like Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, he came out fighting and survived this clash with the Labour leader.

And Mr Zahawi also survives. For now.

485;Wales to introduce tougher controls for tattoos and piercings;Wednesday 25 January 2023 13:48, UK;[];['wales'];['tattoos', 'practitioners', 'licensing', 'wales', 'tattoo', 'standards', 'scheme', 'work', 'uk', 'public', 'controls', 'tougher', 'piercings', 'introduce'];"Wales will introduce tougher controls on tattoo artists, body piercers and cosmetic clinics.

It will become the first UK nation to bring in mandatory licensing, which aims to reduce infections and poor working practices.

The new rules will create a public register of licence holders, with around 3,500 practitioners and 1,868 business premises requiring approval.

The legislation is part of the final phase of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 to improve standards in the industry.

It was due to be introduced in 2020 but was delayed by COVID and Brexit.

The Welsh government launched a 12-week consultation today to hear the views of practitioners, the public, local authorities and other stakeholders.

Some firms admitted tougher requirements will be a ""huge shock"".

But tattoo artist Ashley Davies, who runs Stronghold Tattoo in Cardiff, said the move is positive for the industry.

""It is fantastic that Wales will be the first UK nation to introduce a national licensing scheme for our sector. This will raise standards and should be embraced.""

Ffion Hughes, a permanent make-up and paramedical tattooist based at Little Wren Beauty & Aesthetics in Caernarfon, North Wales, agreed. She said: ""This mandatory scheme will provide a level playing field for reputable businesses in the industry.""

There are signs stricter requirements will work - the pass rate for those who have voluntarily undertaken a level two award in infection prevention and control is 95%.

But some critics believe the changes will not go far enough. New rules won't prevent some people from operating without licences, including self-taught tattoo artists known in the industry as ""scratchers"", they argue.

Wales' chief medical officer, Frank Atherton, thinks the new scheme will work. He said: ""Good standards of hygiene and infection control by all special procedures practitioners and businesses is essential as these procedures are capable of causing harm if not carried out properly.

""This new compulsory licensing scheme will ensure that both clients and practitioners are adequately protected at all times.

""I am very pleased that these impending changes have been widely welcomed by practitioners in Wales, with many already volunteering to meet the new standards.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125141710/http://news.sky.com/story/wales-to-introduce-tougher-controls-for-tattoos-and-piercings-12795125

Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai, 21, was found guilty earlier this week of killing 21-year-old Thomas Roberts in Bournemouth, Dorset, last year.

He will serve a minimum of 29 years.

Before jailing Abdulrahimzai to life, Judge Paul Dugdale said: ""In seconds you took the life of a thoroughly decent man with a bright future who was loved greatly by so many people.

""Your momentary act of extreme, senseless violence has left a family with a tragic loss that they will feel for the rest of their lives.""

Mr Roberts had been acting as a ""peacemaker"" after his friend James Medway got into an argument with Abdulrahimzai over an e-scooter that was left outside a Subway sandwich shop in March.

Mr Roberts slapped Abdulrahimzai in the face during the 24-second confrontation.

Abdulrahimzai then revealed a knife he had hidden between the two pairs of trousers he was wearing and stabbed Mr Roberts twice before running away into nearby woodland.

He then buried the knife before burning the trousers, jacket and an Afghan flag he was wearing as a scarf.

Following the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Simon Huxter of Dorset Police said: ""Tommy's family and loved ones have suffered an unspeakable loss as a result of this horrific incident involving a knife.

""Matters relating to the defendant's background and previous convictions have been shared with relevant agencies to ensure appropriate reviews are carried out and areas for learning are identified.""

Abdulrahimzai claimed he fled his home country of Afghanistan after he was tortured by the Taliban and his parents were killed.

After the verdict was delivered, the court heard how he had previously been convicted of murdering two people in Serbia, as well as a related firearm offence.

A trial was held in his absence after he fled the country, and he was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

He arrived in the UK after leaving the country, but his violent past went undetected, and he even managed to dupe officials into believing he was 14 – up to six years younger than his actual age.

He was placed in foster care upon his arrival, and one of his guardians had previously spotted him carrying a knife.

The Home Office said it will investigate the ""red flags missed"" and look at the full circumstances surrounding the case.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125141710/http://news.sky.com/story/triple-killer-lawangeen-abdulrahimzai-jailed-for-life-for-murder-of-thomas-roberts-in-e-scooter-argument-12794900

Once dubbed ""Putin's chef"", Prigozhin is head of the Wagner Group which has been recruiting convicts to fight in Ukraine.

Mr Rogov, chairman of a Russian organisation in occupied Zaporizhzhia, told state-owned media on Tuesday: ""Prigozhin is effective, and his killing would make a lot of sense, given the media component and how they spin their victories.

""Zelenskyy's inner circle and a fairly large number of people are aware of this request to ask, and even demand, that the Americans kill Prigozhin.""

It comes after Mr Prigozhin clashed with his long-time ally Vladimir Putin over the capture of Soledar in Ukraine.

He claimed that Wagner Group forces were solely responsible for capturing the town, while Mr Putin attributed the success to the Russian military.

That was Saturday Night Live's take on the latest in the scandal surrounding US congressman George Santos.

The US politician is at the centre of a web of extraordinary revelations and accusations covering everything from his heritage to jobs he simply never held.

Described by critics as a ""total fraud"", he is accused of fabricating parts of his resume while running for Congress. While he denies some of the allegations made against him, he has admitted that some of his claims were lies.

Despite the media furore, currently only a ""handful"" of his fellow Republicans are calling for him to go. Speaking to Sky News, a political strategist attributes his behaviour to the ""Trump effect"".

Here's a round-up of Mr Santos's claims, how we got here and what could happen next to the controversial congressman.

Who is George Santos?

It's a seemingly simple question, but one that is becoming increasingly difficult to get a straight answer to. Here is what we know for sure.

Image: George Santos has admitted he lied about working on Wall Street

The Brazilian-American, 34, was elected to represent New York's 3rd Congressional District in November 2022, becoming the first openly gay Republican to win a House seat as a non-incumbent.

While his victory caused a buzz around Capitol Hill, it was soon dimmed by allegations starting in December over his resume.

A New York Times investigation found a number of false claims Mr Santos made on his resume including lies over his education and previous jobs.

From there, it's all unravelled.

His responses have varied too. He has admitted that some were lies, rejected others and has backtracked on a few too.

He's 'Jew-ish' not Jewish

Mr Santos has made conflicting remarks over being Jewish, taking part in a drag performance in Brazil and the circumstances around his mother's death.

So let's start with his heritage.

After his victory, he told the Republican Jewish Coalition summit, the election meant that ""now there will be three"" Jewish Republican members of Congress.

But then afterwards, he backtracked and told the New York Post he ""never claimed to be Jewish"", and said he was Catholic adding: ""Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background, I said I was 'Jew-ish'.""

He said 9/11 'claimed his mother's life' - records show she wasn't in the country

It's also quite confusing when you take a look at the conflicting reports over the death of Mr Santos's mother, Fatima Caruso Devolder.

While running for Congress in 2021, Mr Santos tweeted that the 9/11 terrorist attack in New York ""claimed his mother's life"".

Yet on his campaign website, Mr Santos said his mother was in her office in the South Tower on the day of the terrorist attack but ""survived"" and died ""a few years"" later from cancer.

However, records obtained by Sky's affiliate NBC News and reports by the Washington Post citing immigration records, suggested Ms Devolder had not even been living in the US at the time of the attack and was in fact living in Rio de Janeiro.

He has not publicly commented on that since.

'Sue me for having a life'

Now on to one of the latest claims about the congressman's performance at a drag show.

A Brazilian performer, who uses the drag name Eula Rochard, told Reuters she befriended the now-congressman in 2005 in Brazil.

She said in 2008, he competed in a drag beauty pageant in Rio using the drag name Kitara Ravache.

While the congressman first called the reports ""categorically false"" on Twitter, when confronted on camera, he told US channel ABC7 - ""I was young and I had fun at a festival - sue me for having a life.""

Image: A New York Times investigation found a number of false claims Mr Santos made on his resume

The Trump effect

Political strategist Rina Shah said only a ""handful"" of Republicans are calling for Mr Santos's resignation and his behaviour echoes the ""Trump effect"".

The former senior staffer to two Republican Congress members described him as a ""conman"".

She told Sky News: ""The situation certainly highlights the Donald Trump effect. The impact of the 45th President, a real style of running to just regularly make claims to be boastful in a way of things that were simply not true and proven to be untrue.""

She added that Mr Santos has ""taken on"" that style ""in a defiant manner that says 'come and get me because even if you try to get me, I'll just continue to lie about it'.""

Despite the lies, Ms Shah said no top Republican will take action against him because they ""cannot afford to lose"" his House seat.

The Republicans won a razor-thin majority in the House following the midterms and she warned that Mr Santos's removal could endanger the seat.

He didn't work on Wall Street

While the long list of accusations against Mr Santos grows, he has admitted to lying about some things.

Mr Santos claimed on his campaign website he had a finance career working at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs - but the NYT investigation found neither institution had any record of his employment.

He admitted to lying about his education and the roles at the two firms and told the New York Post - ""My sins here are embellishing my resume. I'm sorry.""

Stealing from a disabled veteran

But there are some cases where Mr Santos has flat-out denied certain claims.

He denied an accusation by veteran Richard Osthoff, who accused him of scamming him of $3,000 from a GoFundMe campaign page raised for his dying service dog in 2016.

Mr Osthoff told the news site Patch that he was told Anthony Devolder, one of the names Mr Santos used before entering politics, had a pet charity called Friends of Pets United.

He claimed Mr Devolder closed the page and disappeared after the funds were raised. Mr Santos has angrily denied the reports and called them ""shocking and insane"".

What makes his 'lies' different?

While some may say lying in politics is not new, one psychologist specialising in lying and deception research explains why Mr Santos's claims and accusations may seem a little different.

Dr Chris Hart, a psychology professor at Texas Woman's University, told Sky News: ""If we look at the lies most politicians tell they're often exaggerations and half-truths. They rarely lie in such a way that they are making a claim which has absolutely no basis in reality and that's where he is different.

""The frequency with which he appears to tell them is a bit surprising compared to other politicians.""

'I will NOT resign'

Revelations about Mr Santos's lies and the allegations against him have caused anger among Democrats who have described him as a ""total fraud"" and are calling for him to resign.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he is a ""complete and total fraud"" and he ""deceived and connived his way into Congress"".

Despite calls from some Republicans and Democrats, Mr Santos has repeatedly refused to resign.

For now, it seems he has no intention to go anywhere.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125150207/http://news.sky.com/story/george-santos-the-truth-about-republican-fraud-and-what-does-the-future-hold-for-him-12793631

Microsoft has not revealed how many were affected, but Downdetector.com, which tracks outages, recorded thousands of people reporting problems with Teams, Outlook, Microsoft 365 and XBox Live.

By later in the morning, Downdetector showed the number of reports had dropped considerably.

Microsoft said it had determined a network connectivity issue was occurring with devices across the Microsoft WAN.

The firm later tweeted it had rolled back a network change it believed was causing the issue and was using ""additional infrastructure to expedite the recovery process"".

496;Justin Bieber selling his back catalogue is eyebrow-raising because of how young the artist is;Wednesday 25 January 2023 16:17, UK;['ian king', '@iankingsky'];['justin bieber'];['catalogue', 'artist', 'selling', 'songs', 'rights', 'music', 'artists', 'work', 'hipgnosis', 'young', 'justin', 'works', 'bieber', 'eyebrowraising'];"Selling the rights to your back catalogue has become a well-trodden path for musicians.

So Justin Bieber is not exactly breaking new ground in selling the rights to his work to Hipgnosis Songs Capital for $200m (£162m).

What is slightly eyebrow-raising about the deal, though, is that, at the age of 28, Bieber is somewhat younger than many of the artists to have done so during the last few years.

Most of the big blockbuster deals have involved so-called 'heritage' acts such as Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen and Fleetwood Mac rather than younger artists.

The rationale for Bieber and the other artists selling their rights is straightforward - they receive a lump sum payment giving them and their loved ones financial security.

For the buyer, the rationale is that songs can be turned into a source of income in a variety of different ways, including streaming, the physical purchase of CDs or vinyl records, downloads, live performances or by licensing their use to the makers of films, TV shows and, increasingly, computer games.

By buying up a large number of back catalogues, in scale, the buyer can build a portfolio that is sufficiently diversified to appeal to all tastes that can generate a consistent flow of earnings regardless of changes in trend.

These buyers, such as Hipgnosis, also argue that by specialising in this field they are well-placed to more successfully commercialise songs by actively managing the portfolio.

The Bieber transaction is slightly riskier from the buyer's perspective, though, because of his relative youth.

Sting sells the rights to his music

Why are so many huge stars selling their music rights?

Image: At 28, Bieber is one of the youngest artists to sell his music rights

Bieber still has many years ahead of him - for better or worse

The likes of Springsteen and Dylan are known quantities: there is an established audience and fanbase that will happily continue to pay for their music and, accordingly, the earnings their work can be relied on to generate are pretty predictable.

Given their ages, too, there is little chance of them being involved in a scandal that would make their work toxic to consumers.

Bieber, on the other hand, still has many more years ahead of him and, accordingly, plenty of time in which to alienate his fanbase either by his behaviour or by producing sub-par new work that puts fans off his past efforts.

Bowie was a pioneer in monetising back catalogues

Music fans will be unsurprised to learn that one of the pioneers in monetising back catalogues effectively was one of pop's greatest innovators - David Bowie.

In 1997, he and his management team came up with the idea of selling asset-backed securities to investors, paying them a return from a share of his future royalties for the next 10 years. He raised $55m (£44m) from the sale of these 'Bowie bonds', some of which, ironically, he used to buy back rights to some of his earlier recordings from his former manager.

Merck Mercuriadis, the founder of Hipgnosis, has built on that idea by seeking to commercialise the rights to back catalogues more aggressively, by seeking to make songs an asset class in their own right and by doing so via a stock market-listed vehicle.

Mr Mercuriadis, a former manager of artists such as Beyonce, Elton John, Morrissey and Guns N' Roses has raised £1.2bn from city investors, such as Axa and Investec, who liked the idea of a reliable stream of earnings that could remain consistent whatever the economic weather. That enabled him to buy the rights to yet more songs.

Image: The Bieber deal is unlikely to be the last done by Hipgnosis Songs Capital

Founder of Hipgnosis has competition

Mr Mercuriadis, whose portfolio includes the works of Blondie, Chic - whose frontman Nile Rodgers is a close friend - and Barry Manilow, does have competition, though.

His rivals include New York-based Primary Wave, which owns a 20,000-song catalogue featuring works by artists including Aerosmith and Bob Marley and Round Hill Music which, like Hipgnosis, is listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its catalogue includes Beatles hits 'From Me To You' and 'She Loves You', as well as the Beatles-penned first single by the Rolling Stones, 'I Wanna Be Your Man'.

Then there is Los Angeles-based Iconic Artists Group, founded by the music industry veteran Irving Azoff, the former manager of The Eagles and Jon Bon Jovi.

It owns the rights to works of artists Linda Ronstadt, Dean Martin, Nat 'King' Cole and the Beach Boys.

There are other big established global music groups which have also been busily buying up rights. For example, Sony of Japan last year bought the rights to Springsteen's back catalogue, while US-based Universal Music bought Dylan's works at the end of 2020. Warner Music, meanwhile, bought the publishing rights to Bowie's back catalogue for $250m in January last year.

Scepticism towards business model

One other curiosity of the Bieber deal speaks to the scepticism, in some quarters, towards the business model.

Shares of Hipgnosis Songs Fund trade at a significant discount to the company's net asset value per share (the value that would be realised, per share, if the company was broken up, its assets sold off and the proceeds returned to shareholders).

That reflects the fact that the market does not believe some of the songs in the company's portfolio are worth what the company says they are. Hipgnosis values its catalogue at $2.2bn (£1.78bn) but the company currently has a stock market valuation of just over £1bn.

That discount - described by Mr Mercuriadis last month as ""unacceptable"" - has prevented the company from raising more money from investors with which to buy more songs.

So the Bieber catalogue has been bought not by Hipgnosis Songs Fund but by the similarly-named Hipgnosis Songs Capital, which is not listed on the stock market but which is instead owned by Blackstone, the private equity giant.

The latter, like Hipgnosis Songs Fund, is advised by Hipgnosis Song Management - which, to add to the confusion, is majority-owned by Blackstone and managed by Mr Mercuriadis.

The Bieber deal is unlikely to be the last done by Hipgnosis Songs Capital. It is reportedly the front-runner to buy Pink Floyd's back catalogue although a sale is said to have been held up by the poor relationship between band members Roger Waters and David Gilmour.

And more broadly, other deals are likely to be done, many of them involving British artists. The weakness of the pound makes their catalogues all the better value for US buyers paying in dollars.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125164857/http://news.sky.com/story/justin-bieber-selling-his-back-catalogue-is-eyebrow-raising-because-of-how-young-the-artist-is-12795234

Train driver Brett McCullough, 45, conductor Donald Dinnie, 58, and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, 62, died when the Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street service crashed into a landslide near Carmont, west of Stonehaven, in Aberdeenshire, in August 2020.

Investigators said the train derailed and slid about 90 metres before hitting and destroying a barrier on the edge of a bridge, leading part of the train to fall down an embankment.

Four firefighters responding to the incident were injured after being struck by an apparently uncontrolled vehicle that had not been properly secured.

Two were treated by ambulance services at the scene and a further two were taken to hospital. None were believed to have been seriously injured.

A man was later charged, but the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) has now decided to drop proceedings at this time.

Many observers fear the Gulf petrostate is the wrong fit for the job of hosting the global climate talks, which agree the collective next step towards tackling climate change.

But Lord Zac Goldsmith, an influential environmentalist and Foreign Office minister, told an audience on Tuesday evening that he had been speaking ""very regularly"" with UAE ministers working on COP28 and was ""very optimistic about it"".

The success of a COP depends largely on the nation holding the presidency, which should drive the direction of the talks, build consensus and hold laggard governments to account.

Some environmentalists have questioned whether oil-producer UAE, which has close ties to others like Saudi Arabia, will lack ambition in getting the world off fossil fuels, preferring to focus on solutions rather than causes.

But at a discussion about COP negotiations at the Canadian embassy in London, Lord Goldsmith said: ""I love the fact that they're putting so much emphasis on nature.""

""I think the UAE is going to do a superb job"" and we are ""going to see something very important happening,"" he added.

His comments may raise eyebrows but are not surprising.

Complex climate negotiations are an exercise in diplomacy, and, in public, delegations usually only ever speak politely about other specific countries.

But campaigners have condemned the UAE's decision to appoint an oil executive as COP28 president, likening it to allowing arms dealers to lead peace talks.

Hope UAE could break 'unhealthy' divide

Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber is the CEO of the state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, one of the world's biggest oil producers.

He is also the UAE government minister for industry and advanced technology and the founding CEO of renewable energy company Masdar.

The UAE draws at least 30% of its GDP from the oil and gas industry, while exports provide the great majority of government revenue, according to the US Department of Commerce.

It has also set a goal to reach net zero by 2050 and invested heavily in renewables.

Canada's climate ambassador, Catherine Stewart, echoed Lord Goldsmith's sentiment, saying the UAE ministers and ambassadors have ""a lot of ambition on climate solutions, in energy transition, in clean technology, innovation"".

It is ""very important"" that COP summits are ""an inclusive process, that everybody has a voice,"" said Ms Stewart, speaking on the same panel, organised by the All Party Parliamentary Environment Group, representing a cross-section of MPs.

Image: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the COP27 climate summit

The UAE team is also ""very well-versed"" on key negotiating issues at this year's talks, she said, including efforts to adapt to climate breakdown and details of a new fund to pay for damage in poor nations struck by climate disasters.

The agreement at the last talks in 2022, COP27 in Egypt, to set up the first such fund in history was celebrated as a victory for vulnerable nations.

But key sticking points, such as who should pay in to the fund, still need to be agreed.

The European Union led the push-back on proposals to see only ""developed"" countries pay in.

These groupings are based on an outdated list from 1992, which would class countries which are major economies, like China and Saudi Arabia, as developing countries, exempting them from paying in.

Ms Stewart said the UAE was well-placed to break the ""unhealthy"" divide between developed and developing countries.

The state is not considered a developed country, yet has ""a lot of means to be able to support developing countries,"" she said.

Speaking more broadly about the process, Lord Goldsmith said not every country ""approaches COPs with good intentions or engages in good faith"".

The nature of the talks - which are based on consensus, meaning everyone must reach agreement - makes it ""relatively easy for a few countries to really knock the process sideways,"" he said.

Enoch Burke was previously jailed for failing to observe a court injunction banning him from attending the school while he was suspended from work.

He was suspended from work last year after a number of incidents stemming from a request from the secondary school's principal.

Mr Burke voiced on several occasions his opposition to the principal's request to address a transgender child by their name and refer to them by the pronoun, ""they"".

Mr Burke was dismissed from his position on Friday.

Regardless, he turned up to Wilson's Hospital School in County Westmeath two days in a row - on Tuesday and Wednesday - and staff denied him entry on both occasions.

Mr Burke was arrested on Tuesday, released, then was seen on the school grounds that very afternoon before leaving.

A day later, Mr Burke's father dropped him off at school but the former teacher was again prevented from entering the building.

Mr Burke was seen in the rain on school grounds and writing in a notebook while standing outside the school.

He was then seen leaving with his dad in the car.

The evangelical Christian was suspended from work on full pay last year pending the outcome of a disciplinary process.

Subsequent events led to his suspension.

A disciplinary hearing was held last week and one of Mr Burke's family issued a statement on his behalf on Friday, saying he had been dismissed.

Mr Burke rejected his dismissal, asserting that he had a right to work and that he had been ""wrongfully"" arrested for trespass on Tuesday.

He said: ""It's not trespassing to turn up at your place of work, that's absolutely not trespassing.""

Image: Mr Burke was spotted hanging around the school grounds

He told reporters the ""purported disciplinary meeting"" and the resulting ""purported dismissal"" was not due to take effect for months, and said he was still a school employee.

He added: ""I'm here to work, here to do my work, as every teacher in the country and every civil servant and every employee has an absolute right to do.""

Analysis by Dominic Waghorn, international affairs editor

Germany has been stuck in an excruciating position. On the one hand, for clear historical reasons, it does not want to be seen taking the lead against Russia. On the other it happens to produce and supply a weapon that could prove crucial in Ukraine's war against Putin.



That at least is how German officials have explained their predicament over the Leopard 2 battle tank. Their critics in the past week's furious tank debate say that is an excuse. It is high time Germany acts its geopolitical shoe size, they say, at the forefront of European nations. With its economic prowess and position in Europe come responsibilities and they should stop shirking them.

Either way Germany's decision to send Leopards, finally and agonisingly reached, is a big deal. It will be make a big difference, perhaps decisively, in a military sense. But geopolitically it sends a clear message, albeit belatedly, to Putin that the West remains united and determined to stop him whatever his clumsy attempts at nuclear blackmail.

Germans are uneasy about military aggression because of their Nazi past. Some have worried about the idea of German tanks rolling east again to kill Russians as they did in the Second World War.

They have also been proud of their policy of Ostpolitik, looking east, normalising relations with Russia and the role that played in ending the Cold War.

But critics say they have been in a muddle. The tanks are being sent not to aggress but to defend. And the last year has proven Ostpolitik a relic of the past or at least in need of an urgent overhaul. Their chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said as much in a speech when he said Germany has reached a Zeitenwende or historic turning point.

Berlin says it did not want to be seen taking the lead over tanks and has only acted now the US has agreed to send them too. But Britain had already taken the initiative sending Challengers.

Rather than being seen as a team player acting on consensus, the last week has seen Germany dragging its heels apparently confused and unsure about its role in the coalition. That is unfortunate because in reality Germany has given huge amounts to help Ukraine.

It has acted now, but the damage to its reputation is done.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125170741/https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russia-responds-to-germany-sending-tanks-saying-it-leads-to-a-new-level-of-confrontation-12541713

Analysis by Tom Clarke, science and technology editor

Well, it was one hell of a turn-off.

According to Octopus energy more than 400,000 of its customers took part in this week's National Grid scheme to reward customers to cut electricity use. Between them the company says they saved the equivalent of Bristol's total electricity demand in the hour the scheme ran for on Monday.

But as the grid moves fast towards net zero, it will take a lot more than a few hundred thousand willing customers to manage the peaks and troughs in electricity supply.

The government wants wind power capacity to double in the next decade and if we don't radically change the way we manage demand and supply, the extremes the National Grid currently has to manage will double too.

We have the technology to do this: batteries on the grid to store excess power on windy days; millions of electric cars connected to people's homes can do the same job too; insulated homes warmed with electric heat pumps could automatically switch off when grid demand is high; attractive tariffs for much cheaper electricity when there's excess supply would incentivise customers.

But while we're doing pretty well at building wind-turbines – we’re a long way from managing demand.

Electric cars are still too expensive for most. So are heat pumps and getting planning permission to install one can be impossible for some. Currently the energy market doesn't give any incentive for customers to switch to these technologies. And while COVID didn't help, energy companies have been slow to roll out a key bit of kit we need: only 50% of homes have a smart metre.

The government is working on electricity market reform, and running trials of things like two-way smart meters for customers to ""sell"" electricity in their vehicle battery back to the grid. But there's a huge amount of detail that still needs to be worked out, and little time to do it in. One end of the electricity system is rushing ahead in the to switch to renewables, while the other end is struggling to catch up.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125170741/https://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-interest-rate-hike-expected-next-week-post-office-reveals-how-many-britons-are-now-re-gifting-or-selling-unwanted-xmas-gifts-12615118

Mr Biden said armoured capability has been ""critical for Ukraine"" and the US ""will train Ukrainian troops as soon as possible"", adding that Germany has ""really stepped up in support"" of Mr Zelenskyy's troops.

The US earlier said it would provide the necessary training and supplies needed to operate and run its M1 Abrams tanks as part of its ""long-term commitment that we have to Ukraine's defence leads"", a senior administration official said.

""In addition to the Abrams we're also procuring eight M88 recovery vehicles,"" the official said.

It is understood the US military aid package is worth $400m (£323m).

Ukraine war - latest: Russia sends warning to US over tanks

Yesterday, Moscow warned Berlin that sending tanks ""does not bode well for future relations"" - and told the US that should it authorise such a move it would be a ""blatant provocation"".

The Russian embassy in Berlin condemned Germany's decision as ""extremely dangerous"" and an ""escalation"" of the conflict ""to a new level of confrontation"".

In a statement, it said ""battle tanks with German crosses will again be sent to the 'eastern front', which will inevitably lead to the death of not only Russian soldiers, but also the civilian population"".

""It destroys the remnants of mutual trust, causes irreparable damage to the already deplorable state of Russian-German relations, casts doubt on the possibility of their normalisation in the foreseeable future,"" it added.

Kyiv has been pleading for months for Western nations to send modern battle tanks to give its forces the firepower and mobility it hopes will break through Russian defensive lines and recapture territory occupied by Russia.

""This decision follows our well-known line of supporting Ukraine to the best of our ability,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We are acting in a closely coordinated manner internationally.""

Addressing the German parliament, he said there would be no ground troops or fighter jets sent to Ukraine.

Although Ukraine has stocks of Soviet-made tanks, President Zelenskyy says his forces need more, faster and deadlier weapons - in particular Western tanks - to push the Russians back.

There had been a sense of frustration among some of Germany's allies about the delay in authorising the Leopards to go to Ukraine.

First time since WW2 German tanks will fight on European soil

Sky's Siobhan Robbins in Berlin said the delay in the German chancellor's decision was driven by fears he may escalate the war or make Germany a target.

""This is the first time since World War Two that German battle tanks will fight on a European battlefield,"" she said.

""The chancellor had to balance the needs of Ukraine with the safety and support of Germans.""

Recent opinion polls showed German voters split on the idea.

The German decision comes after the UK announced it would provide 14 Challenger 2 tanks, which was widely seen as an attempt to persuade other allies to send Leopards, of which there are much higher stocks across Europe.

German tanks decision is a big deal - here's why Dominic Waghorn International Affairs Editor @DominicWaghorn Germany has been stuck in an excruciating position. On the one hand for clear historical reasons it does not want to be seen taking the lead against Russia. On the other it happens to produce and supply a weapon that could prove crucial in Ukraine's war against Putin. That at least is how German officials have explained their predicament over the Leopard 2 battle tank. Their critics in the past week's furious tank debate say that is an excuse. It is high time Germany acts its geopolitical shoe size they say, at the forefront of European nations. With its economic prowess and position in Europe come responsibilities and they should stop shirking them. Either way Germany's decision to send Leopards, finally and agonisingly reached is a big deal. It will be make a big difference perhaps decisively in a military sense. But geopolitically it sends a clear message albeit belatedly to Putin that the West remains united and determined to stop him whatever his clumsy attempts at nuclear blackmail. Germans are uneasy about military aggression because of their Nazi past. Some have worried about the idea of German tanks rolling east again to kill Russians as they did in WW2. They have also been proud of their policy of Ostpolitik, looking east, normalising relations with Russia and the role that played in ending the Cold War. But critics say they have been in a muddle. The tanks are being sent not to aggress but to defend. And the last year has proven Ostpolitik a relic of the past or at least in need of an urgent overhaul. Their chancellor Olaf Scholz said as much in a speech when he said Germany has reached a Zeitenwende or historic turning point. Berlin says it did not want to be seen taking the lead over tanks and has only acted now the US has agreed to send them too. But Britain had already taken the initiative, sending Challengers. Rather than being seen as a team player acting on consensus, the last week has seen Germany dragging its heels apparently confused and unsure about its role in the coalition. That is unfortunate because in reality Germany has given huge amounts to help Ukraine. It has acted now, but the damage to its reputation is done.

'Big step towards stopping Russia'

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hailed the move ""the right decision by NATO Allies and friends"".

""Alongside Challenger 2s, they will strengthen Ukraine's defensive firepower. Together, we are accelerating our efforts to ensure Ukraine wins this war and secures a lasting peace,"" he said.

Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki, who was among those critical of Germany's reluctance, also welcomed the decision as a ""big step towards stopping Russia"".

Earlier this week he had said he was prepared to build a ""smaller coalition"" of countries that would send their tanks to Ukraine anyway.

Sky News understands that American officials will soon announce their intention to send Abrams tanks to help Kyiv fight off Russia's invasion, but just how many is not yet known.

'Whiff of panic' about Russia

It comes as British intelligence suggested Russia's most modern tank had been rushed to the warzone despite not being fully operational.

""In recent months, deployed Russian forces were reluctant to accept the first tranche of T-14 allocated to them because the vehicles were in such poor condition,"" the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest Twitter update.

""It is unclear exactly what aspects of the vehicles prompted this reaction, but within the last three years, Russian officials have publicly described problems with the T-14's engine and thermal imaging systems.

""Therefore, it is unlikely that any deployed T-14 tanks will have met the usual standards for new equipment to be deemed operational,"" the MoD added.

Russia has been ""panicked"" by Berlin's decision and has deployed its newest tank into active service despite reported faults, according to retired Air Vice-Marshal Sean Bell.

""There's just a whiff of panic around the way that Russia is responding here,"" he told Sky News.

""Almost certainly because Russia realises just how decisive the issue of tanks, the Western tanks to Ukraine, could be in this conflict.""

'Global catastrophe'

First introduced in 1979, the Leopard 2 offers good protection against armour-piercing rounds and anti-tank guided weapons.

Berlin said it plans to swiftly begin training Ukrainian tank crews in Germany. The package being put together will also include logistics, ammunition and maintenance.

On Sunday, the speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament, State Duma chairman Vyacheslav Volodin, said: ""Supplies of offensive weapons to the Kyiv regime would lead to a global catastrophe.

""If Washington and NATO supply weapons that would be used for striking peaceful cities and making attempts to seize our territory as they threaten to do, it would trigger a retaliation with more powerful weapons.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125183228/http://news.sky.com/story/blow-to-putin-as-germany-and-us-confirm-they-will-send-tanks-to-ukraine-12794842
506;Michael Gove name-checks Lionel Messi as he compares UK economy to team with 'star striker and defence full of holes';Wednesday 25 January 2023 17:40, UK;['faye brown', '@fayebrownsky'];['lionel messi', 'michael gove'];['levelling', 'leaders', 'political', 'team', 'michael', 'namechecks', 'star', 'holes', 'striker', 'gove', 'messi', 'london', 'football', 'economy', 'lionel', 'uk', 'docklands'];"Michael Gove invoked Lionel Messi in a speech about levelling up in which he compared the UK economy to a football team with a ""star striker and defence full of holes"".

Speaking at the Convention of the North on Wednesday, the cabinet minister likened the way the UK's political economy had been run in the past, reliant on London and the South East, to a failing football team which had let the country down.

He said: ""We all know we can't prosper so much as a state if we rely so much on one region, and within that region, on one city.

""The UK economy has been like a football team with a star striker, but a midfield that consistently struggles to get the ball upfield and a defence full of holes.

""And no forward, not even Lionel Messi, can do it on his own.""

Image: Gove invoked football star Lionel Messi in his speech.

Mr Gove also cited Margaret Thatcher's administration in the 1980s - a decade marked by the closure of coal mines and industrial strife in the North - as a model for elements of levelling up.

He said the former Tory prime minister's transformation of the London docklands was his inspiration for the plan to narrow economic and social disparities between the North and South.

""When the Thatcher government took office in 1979, London's docklands were a derelict economic desert,"" the levelling up secretary told business and political leaders gathered in Manchester.

""The original vision for re-generation of the area, from the Treasury of the time, was simple: just cut taxes and de-regulate and a thousand flowers will bloom in the dusty and contaminated soil of the docklands.""

But he said Mrs Thatcher helped set up deeper government intervention through the London Docklands Development Corporation, bringing jobs and housing and transforming that area of the capital.

He said: ""Government created the environment, the private sector created the jobs. London Docklands today is an economic success story.

""It is that spirit that animates our levelling up policies: active government.""

Revealed: How the North/South divide affects the UK economy

Will PM's levelling up funding generate enough of a political return?

The speech comes after criticism that new funding announced last week for community projects favoured affluent areas over deprived ones.

Separately, an analysis by a northern think tank found the region receives one of the lowest levels of investment among advanced economies.

Mr Gove admitted the UK has an ""enduring and entrenched geographical and social divide"" and said it is ""insufficiently resilient, inherently constrained by supply-side weaknesses and unequal in access to power, capital and investment"".

Levelling up 'should be enshrined in law'

Northern leaders have called for more devolution and funding, saying the concept of levelling up should be ""hard wired"" into UK law to help close the gap in living standards.

Andy Burnham, the Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, pointed to Germany where he said ""there is a law that says there must be equal living standards between the 16 regions"".

""And when you go there you can see it and feel it in the quality of public transport in the different cities, the public realm,"" he told Sky News earlier on Wednesday.

""It's a very balanced country.""

Levelling up was a key policy under former PM Boris Johnson, who said the ""defining mission"" of his government was to break the link between geography and destiny ""so that no matter where you live you have access to the same opportunities"".

But Labour have accused the Conservatives of failing to deliver on that pledge, with shadow housing secretary Lisa Nandy saying the UK must ""change or die"".

She is expected to use her speech at the convention later on Wednesday to urge local leaders to tell Labour what powers they need to drive growth in their areas as part of the party's Take Back Control Act

""For 15 years, since the global crash, the failure of running an economy like this has been plain to see,"" she will say.

""But every time the public has sounded the alarm, hitting our politicians with tsunami after tsunami of discontent, our creaking political system has done nothing.

Abigail Zwerner sent the text around an hour before she was shot in Virginia earlier this month, NBC News reported.

The 25-year-old teacher at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News said the student had said he had a gun in his backpack.

A source told the outlet the text ""showed her frustration"", adding: ""She was frustrated because she was trying to get help with this child, for this child, and then when she needed help, no one was coming.""

A spokesperson for Newport News Public Schools said: ""Anything that has been reported to our school leadership team in regards to concerns at Richneck from teachers and staff members is part of the investigation. It's being thoroughly investigated.""

Teacher will sue school district

Ms Zwerner's lawyer has announced she will sue the school district.

Diane Toscano said on the day of the shooting concerned teachers and employees warned administrators the boy had a gun on him and was threatening other students three times, ""but the administration could not be bothered"".

She said around 12.30pm one teacher told administrators she had taken it upon herself to search the boy's bookbag, but warned he had the gun in his pocket.

Ms Toscano said after 1pm another boy told his teacher the student had shown him the gun and threatened to shoot him, and the teacher reported that to administrators.

Another employee later asked permission to search the boy after hearing about the gun, but ""was told to wait the situation out because the school day was almost over"", Ms Toscano said.

Ms Zwerner had also told school administrators around 11.15am that the boy had threatened to beat up another child.

Police chief Steve Drew has repeatedly characterised the shooting as ""intentional"", saying the boy aimed at Ms Zwerner and fired one round, striking her in the hand and chest.

Ms Zwerner was hospitalised for nearly two weeks, but is now recovering at home, a hospital spokesperson said.

Superintendent George Parker III has said at least one administrator was told on the day of the shooting the boy might have had a weapon, but no weapon was found when his backpack was searched.

Police have said school officials did not tell them about the tip before the shooting, which happened hours later.

The boy's mother legally purchased the gun used in the shooting, police said.

Lawyers representing the boy's family said: ""On behalf of the family of the child, we continue to pray for Ms Zwerner and wish her a complete and full recovery.

The prime minister's spokeswoman earlier on Wednesday declined multiple times to say whether Mr Sunak had ever paid a tax penalty during questions to journalists.

""You wouldn't expect me to get into the prime minister's tax affairs, they are confidential,"" she said, adding: ""The tax affairs of an individual, irrespective of who they are, are confidential.""

She added that the PM will publish his tax return ""in due course"".

But five hours later, a No 10 spokesman told Sky News: ""The prime minister has never paid a penalty to HMRC.""

Mr Sunak is facing pressure to sack Conservative Party chairman Nadhim Zahawi over the estimated £4.8m bill he settled with HMRC while he was chancellor under Liz Truss.

A week ago, Mr Sunak told MPs that Mr Zahawi had ""already addressed the matter in full"" - but Downing Street subsequently revealed the prime minister had not been aware that the Conservative Party chairman had paid a penalty to HMRC as part of the settlement.

Mr Sunak has ordered an investigation by Sir Laurie Magnus, his independent adviser on ministers' interests, into whether Mr Zahawi broke ministerial rules.

Mr Zahawi told Sky News he is ""clearly being smeared"" over questions about his tax affairs - and that he did not ""benefit"" from an ""offshore trust"".

Labour said Mr Sunak should reveal if he has ever paid a tax penalty, while a Labour spokesman replied they would ""come back to you"" when asked if leader Sir Keir Starmer had ever paid one.

At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Sunak was challenged over Mr Zahawi's tax affairs for the second week running by Sir Keir.

Sir Keir said Mr Sunak was too ""weak"" to sack his embattled party chairman.

But Mr Sunak said: ""Of course, the politically expedient thing to do would be for me to have said that this matter must be resolved by Wednesday at noon.

""But I believe in proper due process.""

The Labour leader said: ""We all know why the prime minister was reluctant to ask his party chair questions about family finances and tax avoidance.

The second and final part of the series was screened in the UK on Tuesday evening, while authorities in the world's biggest democracy have been attempting to stop the controversial programme being aired across its colleges, universities and on social media.

The government's efforts have been criticised as an attack on press freedom - while protests calling for its screening have continued to spread.

On Wednesday, police clashed with protesters at Jamia Millia Islamia University in New Delhi where a student group said it planned to screen the banned documentary.

Police equipped with tear gas and riot gear gathered outside the campus gates and detained at least six students as trouble flared.

It comes after Jawaharlal Nehru University in the capital cut off power and the internet on its campus on Tuesday before the documentary was scheduled to be screened by a students' union. Hundreds then reportedly saw it on their laptops and mobile phones.

Authorities at the University of Hyderabad, in southern India, have launched an investigation after a student group showed the banned documentary earlier this week.

The Students' Federation of India has said it plans to show the documentary in every Indian state.

India's federal government blocked the BBC documentary over the weekend and banned people from sharing clips on social media, citing emergency powers under its information technology laws.

Twitter and YouTube complied with the request and removed many links to the documentary.

According to official numbers, the violence left more than 1,000 people dead, most of them Muslims, and erupted after a train carrying Hindu pilgrims caught fire, killing 59 people.

Human rights activists estimate at least double that number died in the rioting.

Mr Modi has denied accusations that he failed to stop the violence.

Ukrainian commander's plea for Western upgrades

'Whiff of panic' about Russia

It comes as British intelligence suggested Russia's most modern tank had been rushed to the warzone despite not being fully operational.

""In recent months, deployed Russian forces were reluctant to accept the first tranche of T-14 allocated to them because the vehicles were in such poor condition,"" the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest Twitter update.

""It is unclear exactly what aspects of the vehicles prompted this reaction, but within the last three years, Russian officials have publicly described problems with the T-14's engine and thermal imaging systems.

""Therefore, it is unlikely that any deployed T-14 tanks will have met the usual standards for new equipment to be deemed operational,"" the MoD added.

Russia has been ""panicked"" by Berlin's decision and has deployed its newest tank into active service despite reported faults, according to retired Air Vice-Marshal Sean Bell.

""There's just a whiff of panic around the way that Russia is responding here,"" he told Sky News.

""Almost certainly because Russia realises just how decisive the issue of tanks, the Western tanks to Ukraine, could be in this conflict.""

'Global catastrophe'

First introduced in 1979, the Leopard 2 offers good protection against armour-piercing rounds and anti-tank guided weapons.

Berlin said it plans to swiftly begin training Ukrainian tank crews in Germany. The package being put together will also include logistics, ammunition and maintenance.

On Sunday, the speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament, State Duma chairman Vyacheslav Volodin, said: ""Supplies of offensive weapons to the Kyiv regime would lead to a global catastrophe.

""If Washington and NATO supply weapons that would be used for striking peaceful cities and making attempts to seize our territory as they threaten to do, it would trigger a retaliation with more powerful weapons.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125183228/http://news.sky.com/story/blow-to-putin-as-both-germany-and-us-confirm-they-will-send-tanks-to-ukraine-12794842

Rishi Sunak has never paid a tax penalty to HMRC, Number 10 has said.

She was asked the question in light of the settlement Conservative Party chairman Nadhim Zahawi reached when he was chancellor last summer.

""You wouldn't expect me to get into the prime minister's tax affairs, they are confidential,"" she said in the wake of PMQs earlier today.

515;Baby who died 23 minutes after birth 'failed in most cruel way' by NHS Trust, says mother;Wednesday 25 January 2023 17:44, UK;['lisa dowd', '@lisaskynews'];['nhs'];['trust', 'nottingham', 'cruel', 'staff', 'wynter', 'died', 'told', 'minutes', 'repeatedly', 'baby', 'birth', 'care', 'safety', 'way', 'andrews', 'failed', 'mother', 'nhs'];"A hospital trust has pleaded guilty to failing to provide safe care and treatment following the death of a baby at just 23 minutes old.

The mother of Wynter Andrews said she was ""failed in the most cruel way"" by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH).

The trust put Sarah Andrews and her daughter Wynter at ""significant risk of avoidable harm"", according to a prosecutor, by being understaffed and failing to ensure staff at the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) in Nottingham were aware of its guidelines.

Wynter was ""born in a poor condition with a very slow heart rate"" by emergency caesarean section in September 2019.

Image: Sarah Andrews (left) delivers a statement outside Nottingham Magistrates' Court.

Just 23 minutes and 30 seconds later, she died in the arms of her mother and father, Gary Andrews, despite ""extensive efforts"" to resuscitate her.

An earlier inquest into Wynter's death ruled that she died after suffering a loss of oxygen flow to the brain, which could have been prevented by staff at the QMC.

The NHS trust admitted two counts of failing to provide safe care and treatment resulting in harm and loss in relation to Wynter and her mother.

Speaking outside Nottingham Magistrates' Court alongside the family's solicitor, Mrs Andrews said: ""As first-time parents, all we ever wanted was to bring our precious baby home.

""Management at the trust were repeatedly warned by staff about safety at the unit, but they failed to act. They were repeatedly warned by bereaved and harmed families, but they failed to listen and to learn.

""They were repeatedly told by different investigative bodies over many years about maternity safety concerns at the trust, yet they failed to make the critical changes needed.

""We hope that this criminal prosecution against the trust for its unsafe care will finally be the jolt they need to prioritise patient safety and result in meaningful change.""

Following the hearing, Anthony May, the trust's chief executive, said: ""We are truly sorry for the pain and grief that we caused Mr and Mrs Andrews due to failings in the maternity care we provided.

""We let them down at what should have been a joyous time in their lives.

Ryan Donoghue, prosecuting, outlined multiple ""serious"" and ""sustained"" failings in the care of Mrs Andrews, exacerbated by staff shortages which led to the midwife caring for her also having to care for a patient on another ward.

Mr Donoghue told the court that the trust ""failed to ensure that staff were appropriately aware and trained"" in policies concerning the care of expectant mothers and delivering babies, including physical checks, when to consult more senior colleagues and the prescription of drugs.

It is not known when flying training on the Hawk T2 jets at an air base in North Wales will resume.

The pause will be another blow for a training programme to deliver fast jet fighter pilots that has already been plagued by problems and chronic delays for years.

Sky News revealed last year that an ""emerging"" problem had been identified with the Rolls-Royce engine on the Hawk jet, used by fast jet recruits for training at RAF Valley.

A source on Wednesday claimed the issue involved engine blades wearing out.

""Now one has broken and gone down the engine,"" the source said, asking to remain anonymous.

An RAF spokesperson confirmed that flying on the Hawk 2 jet had been paused ""as a precaution"".

""Post a recent issue on the runway involving an RAF Hawk TMk2 engine, as a precautionary measure, flying has been temporarily paused pending the results of the technical investigation,"" the spokesperson said.

It is understood that the RAF is working closely with the manufacturer and awaiting analysis on the specific engine.

Flying training will only resume when it is deemed safe to do so.

The problem with the training fleet will not impact the Red Arrows team, which operates Hawk T1 aircraft.

In an exclusive report last August, Sky News, citing leaked documents, revealed how issues with the Hawk training aircraft and a ""damaging drain"" of flying instructors quitting for jobs in the industry had helped push the RAF's fast jet pilot training into a new crisis.

RAF recruits can spend up to eight years passing through the training pipeline. The length of time should be only two or three years.

Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, gave Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston, the head of the RAF, the task of fixing flying training as his only priority more than three years ago.

518;Westminster Accounts: Speakers call for overhaul of All-Party Parliamentary Groups;Wednesday 25 January 2023 18:44, UK;['sam coates', '@samcoatessky'];['westminster accounts'];['accounts', 'appgs', 'sky', 'parliamentary', 'westminster', 'consider', 'speakers', 'overhaul', 'funded', 'think', 'lord', 'appg', 'way', 'groups', 'allparty'];"Parliament's reputation is being put at risk by groups of MPs that can be funded by lobbyists, according to a rare joint letter from the speakers of both the House of Commons and Lords.

Parliament's two most powerful figures called for a major overhaul in the way All-Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs) operate in a letter - written on the day Sky News revealed the scale of business influence directed at these groups and published today.

Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Lord McFall have made an unusual joint intervention to try and stop the number of APPGs - which already tops 700 - from proliferating further.

They also want to make it tougher to set one up, as at the moment they can be created with minimum effort, calling for APPGs to publish accounts and more donation information than available at present.

Politics live: Number 10 releases update on Rishi Sunak's tax affairs

The two speakers issued the warning following coverage earlier this month by Sky News - as part of the Westminster Accounts - about the issues with the way APPGs are currently regulated.

They said: ""The current system has not prevented reputational risks to Parliament or the proliferation of APPGs.

""We consider our proposals would ensure that APPGs really commanded support from members and would increase transparency without overly increasing the burdens on APPGs, which can provide a valuable means for members to learn and engage on topics they consider are important.""

APPGs are informal interest groups of MPs and peers that facilitate cross-party work on an issue, a country or a sector, but Lord Pickles, the former cabinet minister and the chair of one of Westminster's ethics watchdogs, has told Sky News they could represent ""the next big scandal"".

The groups have received over £20m worth of funding from external organisations since the 2019 general election, with registered lobbying agencies dominating the ranks of the biggest benefactors.

Image: Lord McFall presides over the House of Lords

MPs would have to approve any further changes to the rules governing APPGs, and it's unclear whether they might resist further reforms.

Chair of the Standards Committee, Chris Bryant, said that they are determined to do another report on the issue by Easter.

Lobbying industry insiders have defended the role of APPGs in the democratic process as a ""force for good"" - but one conceded to Sky News ""there are bad ones"", while another said a ""minority"" are funded by organisations ""trying to unfairly influence parliamentary decisions"".

'Direct point of access'

Gill Morris, the CEO of DevoConnect - which has provided £192,000 worth of secretariat services to six APPGs since the last election - told Sky News in an interview aired earlier this month: ""There are really good APPGs and there are others where it's quite clear that they are a direct point of access.

""I think it might be true [but] I think probably, most groups do things or operate the way we do.""

Sarah Pinch, a former president of the Chartered Institute of Public Relations, said the issue with APPGs was not about how they were funded, but the activity they undertook.

""I think there are a minority of APPGs that are funded by certain organisations who are peddling their line and they are trying to unfairly influence parliamentary decisions through a system that was not set up to do that,"" she said.

In the letter Sir Lindsay and Lord McFall called for one person to be given the power to block new APPGs.

""We reiterate the view that there should be a defined gatekeeper role for such groups,"" they wrote. ""Mr Speaker has previously suggested that the chairman of ways and means could usefully perform this role in the Commons, though there could also be a place for joint Lords involvement in performing this function.""

They said the gatekeeper would make sure a new APPG would not duplicate existing groups before it is allowed to be constituted.

""It is of central importance that at the same time the applicant should also explain how and by whom the APPG would be funded,"" the speakers added. ""There should be more rigour about the AGMs of APPGs.

""We consider it should be a requirement that AGMs are chaired by a member of the panel of chairs (or potentially a Lords equivalent) from outside the APPG itself.

​""We consider there are sufficient personnel available to undertake this task, and to ensure the proper conduct of Annual General Meetings.

""AGMs should consider an annual report from the officers, as well as the accounts of the organisation. AGMs should not be considered valid if these were not available, and APPGs failing to meet this requirement should consequently be struck from the register.""

​They concluded: ""We recognise that an increased level of scrutiny before APPGs are established could potentially give rise to an impression that the activities of a particular APPG are then 'endorsed' by both Houses of Parliament.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125184737/http://news.sky.com/story/westminster-accounts-speakers-call-for-overhaul-of-all-party-parliamentary-groups-12795326

Mr Hancock is understood to have been in the station when the incident started, before it continued on a train.

""Fortunately, this sort of behaviour is a rare occurrence, but it's instances like this that reemphasise the importance of shutting down baseless misinformation which causes so much harm.

The woman said she hoped legal action might help expose the detail of the police mistakes.

She said: ""I am not the same person I was before I met him. During our time together, he made me feel scared, humiliated, and worthless. I have carried all of those feelings with me for years following the relationship.

""After what he put me through, I have struggled with trust. I do not trust men, I am unable to build healthy relationships. I do not trust authorities, especially the police.""

The Metropolitan Police has accepted it failed Carrick's victims by not properly vetting him when he joined the force and letting him stay for two decades, even though it was warned many times of his predatory behaviour.

The victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, lived with Carrick at his Hertfordshire home for many months, while he served as an armed officer protecting parliament and foreign embassies. He raped her repeatedly.

Carrick was finally arrested for rape in 2021 and suspended. Last week, he admitted 49 sex offences, including 24 rapes, against a dozen victims.

The woman, now in her 40s, has consulted lawyer Harriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women's Justice. Ms Wistrich said: ""We are exploring potential legal remedies, which could include a claim for damages under the Human Rights Act and potentially other failings.

""We are also very keen to bring together the information that we have about the history of Carrick's offending to ensure that there's really a thorough inquiry into what the hell was going on.

The Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE) said as many as 57,000 experienced ""potential harm"".

""Longer patient handover delays reached unprecedented levels in December, with the 227,000 hours lost double that of December 2021,"" the AACE report states.

Official NHS data shows 44% of ambulance patients waited at least 30 minutes to be handed to A&E; teams in the week between Christmas and new year - the highest on record.

Some 26% of ambulances waited over an hour in the week ending 1 January.

The AACE report said some 36,000 patients were delayed at least two hours, with 23,000 waiting more than three.

It said the average handover time nearly doubled over the last year, from 29 minutes in December 2021 to 55 minutes in December 2022.

Martin Flaherty, AACE managing director, said: ""Our December 2022 data for handover delays at hospital emergency departments shows some of the worst figures we have recorded to date and clearly underlines that not enough is being done to reduce and eradicate these dangerous, unsafe and harmful occurrences.

""At a national level, the average handover time has nearly doubled over the past 12 months, increasing from 29 minutes in December 2021 to 55 minutes in December 2022.

""However, it is particularly worrying that longer delays - those that continue over one, two and three hours - reached unprecedented levels in December.

""The impact on patients is significant and we estimate that around 57,000 patients experienced potential harm as a result of long handover delays in December 2022, with around 6,000 of these experiencing severe harm.

""This does not take into account patients in the community who we were unable to attend due to resources being held at local emergency departments, so the real figure is likely to be much higher.

""We are also acutely aware of how difficult these current working conditions are for ambulance service employees and the considerable impact they are having on their mental health and wellbeing.

""We know that there are good examples of hospitals that are managing their handover delays effectively, and we are doing all we can to help share best practice when it occurs, but now is the time for firm leadership on this vital issue if we are to reduce and eradicate these tremendously damaging delays.""



Commenting on the report, Sara Gorton, head of health at the union Unison said: ""On the government's watch, the ambulance service has gone from being under pressure during the winter to barely coping all year round. No wonder people are leaving faster than new recruits can be appointed.

""A better deal on pay and a serious plan to tackle staffing shortages can't come soon enough.""

The NHS has said it faced a ""twindemic"" of flu and COVID while also struggling to discharge mentally fit patients from hospital into social care.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are taking action to improve access to urgent and emergency care - including investing up to £250m to free up hospital beds, alleviate pressures on A&E; and unblock delays in handing patients over from ambulances.

""This is on top of £500m to speed up the safe discharge of patients and creating the equivalent of 7,000 more beds as well as establishing 24/7 data-driven system control centres in every local area to manage demand and capacity.

525;Darren Moore: Man, 50, arrested on suspicion of killing well known drag queen in Cardiff city centre;Wednesday 25 January 2023 20:03, UK;[];['cardiff'];['moore', 'drag', 'mr', 'killing', 'moores', 'support', 'investigation', 'cause', 'centre', 'windsor', 'man', 'queen', 'known', 'darren', 'family', 'suspicion', 'city', 'social'];"A 50-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter of a well-known drag queen who was found dead in a city centre alleyway in Cardiff.

Darren Moore, a 39-year-old from Newport, was last seen at around 5am on Sunday while wearing full face make-up, a luminous green dress, blonde wig, heels and carrying a clutch bag.

Later that night, officers were called to an alleyway near Windsor Place and Park Lane where his body was found.

South Wales Police said on Wednesday they had arrested a 50-year-old man on suspicion of manslaughter and he remains in custody.

A post-mortem has also been carried out, while further examinations are ongoing to establish the cause of Mr Moore's death.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Raikes, leading the investigation, said: ""Initial investigations have so far not revealed or confirmed any obvious cause of death, however extensive inquiries are continuing to establish the cause and circumstances of Mr Moore's death.

""I would like to thank the community for the excellent support they have provided to this investigation so far, which has helped enormously, and I would appeal for anyone with information to please come forward.

""I would also again like to respectfully ask people to refrain from speculating on social media about what has occurred and please let the police investigation take its course.""

Detectives are appealing for anyone who may have seen Mr Moore in the city centre during the early hours of Sunday to get in touch.

They also want to speak to anybody who was in the vicinity of Park Lane and Windsor Place between 3am and 7am.

An incident room has been set up at Cardiff Central police station, the force said.

'Our social butterfly never judged others'

In a statement issued by police, Mr Moore's family said: ""Darren Moore was a loving husband, son, brother, uncle and friend.

""He was always the life and soul wherever he went, he was our social butterfly. He made sure he had a lot of time for people, and never judged others.

""Darren's husband and family want to thank everyone for their support but now need time to grieve and respectfully request privacy at this time.""

A GoFundMe fundraising page has been set up to raise money for Mr Moore's family.

It said: ""Anyone who knew Darren would know how he was never understated in his appearance and costume. His larger-than-life character and charisma were something that you'll never forget.

""We'd like to support Darren and the family and give Darren the biggest send-off. If you're able to and can afford a few quid, please donate what you can to ensure we do him proud.""

Tributes have been paid from across Cardiff's gay community.

The Golden Cross, Wales's oldest LGBT+ venue, posted on Twitter: ""We are deeply saddened to learn of Darren Moore's passing.

""Many of you will know of his long-standing support of the Golden.

527;Nadhim Zahawi tax row: Rishi Sunak's integrity is taking a hit as he prolongs the pain over Tory party chairman;Wednesday 25 January 2023 20:40, UK;['beth rigby', '@bethrigby'];['nadhim zahawi', 'rishi sunak'];['pain', 'prime', 'pms', 'mr', 'row', 'prolongs', 'minister', 'tax', 'chairman', 'tory', 'party', 'keir', 'sunak', 'zahawi', 'rishi', 'sunaks', 'taking'];"There is plenty of bemusement, irritation and anger in some quarters of the Conservative Party as to why Nadhim Zahawi is still in post.

Revelations that the party chairman reportedly paid nearly £5m to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to settle a tax dispute, and pay a penalty over around £27m of wealth on which he did not initially pay tax is, for some MPs, a closed case rather than something that needs further investigation.

As one minister pointed out to me on Wednesday, what really mattered here was not the conflict of interest of Mr Zahawi being the chancellor while he was in dispute with the HMRC or what the PM knew when.

What matters here is the naked optics of a cabinet minister receiving around £27m that he didn't initially pay tax on when people were struggling to make ends meet.

So while the prime minister on Wednesday spoke of following ""due process"" in determining whether the cabinet minister had broken the ministerial code, the public is more likely to have decided Mr Zahawi had not followed due process of paying his taxes - as they have to do every year - and drawn their own conclusions.

For his part, Mr Zahawi is clear that it was a ""careless"" error, the tax he owed was paid and the matter settled.

But the sight of Sir Keir Starmer taking easy shots at the prime minister for not asking Mr Zahawi to stand aside over the whole affair was hard for some to stomach.

Many MPs have concluded the party chairman is going to have to stand down over this affair anyway, and the investigation into the matter by the PM's independent ethics advisor is only drawing out the pain.

""Many people in the party think that the situation is unsustainable and will only end one way,"" is how one senior party figure put it to me on Wednesday.

""The point here is that the public sees a minister with £27m who didn't pay his tax.""

There are myriad explanations as to why Mr Sunak hasn't sacked Mr Zahawi.

His team argues that the prime minister promised to do things properly and ""there is a process to follow"".

He is also in a bit of a bind given that he neither sacked nor suspended Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab over the eight bullying allegations he is now under investigation over, so it would have been hard to treat Mr Zahawi differently.

There is also chatter that he doesn't have the authority just to sack the party chairman without a fight or backlash, and instead has to do it following a procedure.

But the situation is causing problems.

'Job too big' for Sunak

Sir Keir used it to reiterate his ""weak prime minister"" attack line on Wednesday and then went further to suggest that the combination of internal scandals and the problems in the NHS is evidence that the ""job is too big"" for Mr Sunak.

For a prime minister who has styled himself as a competent technocrat getting on with delivering, this is a very uncomfortable jibe that he will not want to stick.

It also calls into question the prime minister himself, both over his promise to lead a government of integrity and his own tax affairs.

Sir Keir was at it again on Wednesday, goading the prime minister over last year's revelations that his wife Akshata Murty had in the past avoided tax in the UK by claiming non-dom status.

""We all know why [the PM's] reluctant to ask his chairman about family affairs and tax avoidance,"" remarked Sir Keir to the clear discomfort of the man sitting opposite him in the chamber.

Conflict over tax affairs

One former senior minister told me they think it's difficult for the PM to sack someone over tax affairs when his family had its own tax scandal last year and thinks Number 10 is keeping Mr Zahawi in place as a ""human shield"" to avoid the attention shifting to the PM's tax affairs.

But the questions are now being directed to Mr Sunak's door after he was forced to confirm publicly that he had never paid a penalty to the taxman over his own tax affairs.

For the PM's part, he might well believe the inquiry by his independent ethics advisor is the right way to handle the situation. But his approach means he is also having to field the political blows and burn through his own political capital over a scandal that many in his party think will end with Mr Zahawi having to resign anyway.

528;Ukraine war: Zelenskyy's troops are being given the latest battle tanks from the West - but will they get them in time?;Wednesday 25 January 2023 20:32, UK;['dominic waghorn', '@dominicwaghorn'];['ukraine'];['zelenskyys', 'west', 'given', 'battle', 'troops', 'latest', 'zelenskyy', 'ukraine', 'western', 'giving', 'abrams', 'quite', 'tanks', 'putin', 'war', 'policy'];"When Sky's Kay Burley broke the news to Volodymyr Zelenskyy his birthday wish had been granted and tanks were on the way, his face said it all.

But the words that followed are crucial too. Ukraine is being given the latest Western battle tanks, and a lot of them it seems. But will they get them in time?

The shift in Western policy is significant. Until recently Western governments were giving the Ukrainians just enough they hoped to discourage Vladimir Putin and persuade him to give up. It has been for months a policy based on wishful thinking.

Russia now 'on the backfoot' as US confirms M1 Abrams package to Kyiv - Ukraine war latest

The West is now giving Ukraine enough to potentially beat Russia - and for several reasons.

Firstly, Mr Putin is showing no signs of being discouraged. Quite the opposite, he is doubling down, mobilising hundreds of thousands of troops, preparing, believe his enemies, for a spring offensive.

Secondly, Mr Putin's tactics. His willingness to target civilian infrastructure should surprise no one. It is just what his forces did in Chechnya and, along with their allies, in Syria too.

But Russia's pulverise-and-conquer approach to war is taking a massive toll on entire towns in the east. And having failed to destroy Ukraine's electricity grid it is now going back to the barbarism of dropping massive ordnance on apartment blocks.

Thirdly, the war is straining NATO's supplies. Shells above all. Both sides are firing so many their suppliers are struggling to keep up.

So time to up the ante; a new impetus to beat Putin is replacing caution based on fear of Russian retaliation.

Will the sea change in policy be equally significant on the battlefield? Most likely yes, if enough tanks are sent and with the right resources and training. But these are all quite big ifs.

It will take time. The American M1 Abrams will take the longest but, in truth, their donation is more symbolic, giving the Germans top cover to authorise releasing their Leopard 2s.

But even the Leopards, deployed across Europe with some in countries bordering Ukraine, could take three months to arrive we are told.

Crew training should only take weeks but learning how to deploy them in what the military calls combined arms operations alongside infantry and other platforms will take longer, potentially quite a lot longer.

""Speaking frankly, the number of tanks and the delivery time to Ukraine is crucial,"" President Zelenskyy told Kay Burley.

And he knows Germany's dithering over the issue has already cost time. His commanders fear a Russian offensive using quantity over quality could overwhelm them. They have no idea when that moment is likely to come but would dearly like to have the new tanks when it does.

It will require patience. This cannot be rushed. The Leopards, Challengers and Abrams will take time to send into battle.

But if they are used judiciously, the impact could be decisive on the direction of this war.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125214719/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-zelenskyys-troops-are-being-given-the-latest-battle-tanks-from-the-west-but-will-they-get-them-in-time-12795421

The energy supplier said more than 400,000 customers cut down their energy usage between 4.30pm and 6pm on Tuesday.

The scheme is designed to help reduce strain on the power grid by paying customers to switch off appliances.

The average customer was paid £2.50 in special points, which entitles them to rewards, for reducing their demand by around 60% on average.

The top 5% were paid an average of £15 in points.

Customers were paid 3,200 OctoPoints per kWh reduced, the equivalent of £4.

Octopus said the initial data showed it had reduced the UK's energy usage by around 250MWh - the same as the city of Liverpool going off grid for an hour.

The company said participation on Tuesday was similar to Monday, but as Tuesday's event was higher paying and there was 30% more energy reduced than the night before, less than £1m was paid out on Monday.

The so-called Demand Flexibility Service was launched by National Grid's Electricity System Operator (ESO) to help reduce peak demand during times when supplies are tighter than normal.

Octopus is the most active in the new scheme, though several other energy suppliers also took part in the system, which went live for the first time on Monday evening after being tested on several occasions previously.

By asking households to use electricity at slightly different times than usual, the grid does not have to pay very expensive power plants to come online and produce more power.

Experts consider it a first step towards a system where smart technology in people's homes helps to switch usage to off-peak times, saving households money and taking pressure off the power grid.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230125214719/http://news.sky.com/story/octopus-energy-pays-customers-more-than-1m-for-saving-energy-12795452

She was born three weeks prematurely in Coventry Hospital and is one of the National Health Service's newest patients.

But her first breaths, touches and tears will be experienced in a system that has already been looking after her for months.

She was born in the midst of an NHS winter crisis, with hospitals struggling against surging demand and crippling industrial action. These thoughts raced through her mother Yvonne Amankwa-Mainu's mind as she prepared for her baby's arrival.

""It makes you nervous, yeah"", Mrs Amankwa-Mainu said. ""Because you know you're using that service. You're going to need that service at one point in pregnancy. So it makes you nervous. You know, every time you go into hospital, you're thinking oh, is it gonna? Am I going to be the next person?""

The NHS is struggling with the surge in flu and COVID cases and with the rebound of seasonal respiratory illnesses. On top of that it has to deal with strikes by nurses and ambulance workers.

Mrs Amankwa-Mainu has no doubt about whose side she is taking in this dispute.

""The government needs to listen to doctors and nurses and people in the NHS and really sort it out,"" she says unequivocally.

Shylo and her proud mother are under the watchful eye of midwife Channel Griffiths.

Her department, she says, like everywhere else in the NHS is struggling to deal with workforce shortages. There are other factors too. Ms Griffiths says her expectant mothers are getting older and with more underlying health conditions.

""We need more midwives,"" Ms Griffiths says.

""There are a lot more women now having children that have a lot more comorbidities and things like obesity. They've also got a chronic history of diabetes and high blood pressure, which makes them more high risk at the beginning of their pregnancy.""

Mr Trump was suspended on 7 January, a day after the deadly 2021 insurrection.

The suspension sparked other social media companies to make similar moves.

But he was recently reinstated on Twitter after Elon Musk took over the company, despite not yet tweeting on the platform.

Groups of people wearing life jackets and some wrapped in blankets were pictured being brought into Dover, Kent, on a Border Force boat.

A record 45,728 made the crossing on small boats last year, up more than 60% on the previous year.

Government figures show 592 migrants have crossed the Channel so far this year, but the activity was only recorded on three days in January.

Some 1,339 made the journey in the first month of 2022.

It comes as MPs heard flights sending migrants to Rwanda may not take place until later this year at the earliest amid ongoing legal action.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said the government still hopes to restart flights ""as soon as possible"", but said it was ""right"" to wait until court appeals have concluded.

Asked when the government hopes to restart flights to Rwanda, Mr Jenrick told MPs: ""As soon as possible. It obviously remains the government's policy. We see it as an absolutely critical way of deterring people from making the dangerous crossing and changing the business model of the people smugglers.""

High Court judges ruled the policy was lawful last month, but so far efforts to launch it have been mired by legal action.

537;Treasury reviewing processes after reports it helped Wagner Group boss circumvent sanctions to sue British journalist;Wednesday 25 January 2023 23:00, UK;['alix culbertson', '@alixculbertson'];['rishi sunak', 'russia', 'ukraine'];['reviewing', 'mr', 'russian', 'helped', 'prigozhin', 'cartlidge', 'reports', 'processes', 'right', 'wagner', 'sanctions', 'legal', 'treasury', 'journalist', 'sue', 'group'];"The Treasury is reviewing its processes after reports it helped the head of Russia's notorious mercenary Wagner Group circumvent UK sanctions to take a British journalist to court.

James Cartlidge, exchequer secretary, confirmed a review is under way about the Treasury's decision-making but could not comment publicly on the case of Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin.

Investigative website openDemocracy reported a small Treasury team issued licences to allow British lawyers to help Mr Prigozhin - once dubbed ""Putin's chef"" - launch libel action against Bellingcat journalist Eliot Higgins in the UK in 2021.

At the time, the Russian oligarch was subject to UK sanctions.

The Wagner Group has been recruiting convicts to fight in Ukraine, where it is heavily involved in Russia's offensive. Ukraine says its fighters have died in their thousands.

Mr Prigozhin took legal action against Mr Higgins for articles and tweets about the Russian and the Wagner Group's operations in Africa and the Middle East, as well as his links to the Kremlin.

Mr Cartlidge said the Treasury's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (Ofsi) adheres to a strict set of rules ""for strong constitutional reasons"" when granting sanctioned individuals permission to bring lawsuits as ""everyone has a right to legal representation"".

Labour accused the government of giving a ""waiver for a warlord"" to pursue legal action, which it said was aimed at intimidating critics of Mr Prigozhin.

The government has been asked by several MPs to proscribe the Wagner Group as a terrorist organisation.

Mr Higgins' situation was brought up in an urgent question in the Commons on Wednesday, with Mr Cartlidge replying: ""It is a longstanding custom that the government does not comment publicly on individual cases.

""It would not be appropriate to break this custom even in a case as serious as this where there is obviously public interest.""

Describing Ofsi's approach, Mr Cartlidge said: ""Applications are assessed solely on a costs basis, and as a country with checks and balances it is right that the relevant court should decide the outcome of the substantive merits of a case rather than the government.

""However, I can confirm, in light of recent cases and related to this question, the Treasury is now considering whether this approach is the right one, and if changes can be made without the Treasury assuming unacceptable legal risk and ensuring that we adhere to the rule of law.""

He added that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who was chancellor at the time, had no part in considering whether Mr Prigozhin should be granted permission.

Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said: ""The government appears to have granted a waiver for a warlord that enabled him to launch a legal attack on a British journalist.

""This is a perfect example of a Slapp (strategic lawsuit against public participation) lawsuit, designed to silence critics through financial intimidation.""

Alicia Kearns, Conservative chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, urged the government to ""commit to looking at whether we need to introduce ministerial oversight"" on the process.

David Davis, the Conservative former cabinet minister, added: ""Of course you have right to representation if you are defending yourself in court.

""There is no fundamental right to use legal representation to destroy somebody else or shut down free speech.""

Mr Cartlidge replied: ""I do think that the right to legal representation is a fundamental tenet of our democracy and that can mean that individuals and persons who we - and I'm not commenting on the specific case - but it can mean that individuals and persons who we find distasteful therefore have a right to legal representation.

""Let's not forget, even at the Nuremberg trials, people who had committed the most heinous crimes in the history of the Western world were legally represented.""

Labour former minister Liam Byrne accused Mr Cartlidge of having ""just confessed"" sanctions implementation are ""out of ministerial control"" - which the minister denied.

""We sanctioned Prigozhin because he was operating 'a deniable military capability for the Russian state',"" Mr Byrne told the Commons.

""Ten months later civil servants under his control signed off £3,500 for business class flights, £320 for luxury accommodation at the Grand Hotel Europe Belmond, £150 for subsistence and more.

""Let's be very clear about what the leaked emails from that conversation show. They show that Prigozhin's lawyers wanted to sue Eliot Higgins and Bellingcat 'because public rebuttal of the article is one of the reasons for his sanctions designation'.

""He signed off money for a warlord to prosecute an English journalist in an English court to undermine the sanctions regime that he himself is responsible for.

There are those - like former health secretary Sajid Javid - who think the way forward for the free cradle-to-grave service is to start charging the patients who can afford it.

Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting's reply to this proposal was: ""Over my dead body.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:38 Can the NHS survive?

Defenders of the NHS as a free for all service - including the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown - warn this will create a two-tier system that will fail the most vulnerable.

However, all sides agree that the NHS is in need of reform and cannot be allowed to endure an endless cycle of summer and winter crises.

At its inception, the National Health Service was designed to serve a very different population. Today, thanks to advances in science and medicine, people live much longer.

But living longer does not necessarily mean people are healthier - and an ageing population, many with complex comorbidities, presents serious challenges.

Professor Kiran Patel, chief medical officer at University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire, has advised on future health planning at a regional and national level.

""We could always say that planning could have been better, but we've been planning for many, many decades,"" Prof Patel says.

""We've known the population is getting older. We know that the public expect more, we know that technology and digital health care is up there [in term of priorities].""

COVID has left a long shadow over the NHS. We are still learning about the impact of the virus on our bodies.

We can see already its impact on patient waiting lists that now stand at over seven million.

But Prof Patel argues that the pandemic's legacy is not all bad.

""The pandemic has forced us to actually adopt a lot of that [new technology] and to start thinking a bit more clearly in terms of planning, not just services, but also our workforce for the future as well,"" he said.

The workforce issue is critical. There are over 165,000 vacancies currently in the NHS.

Ambulance workers, nurses and hospital staff are striking for better pay - and will continue their industrial action for weeks to come unless their demands are met.

They are burnt out, demoralised and feel undervalued.

In November 2022, Health Secretary Steve Barclay outlined five priorities in the short term for the NHS.

They were employing more staff for NHS 111 and 999 services, focusing on urgent and emergency care, tackling delays in discharge from hospital, improving access to primary care, and investing in technology.

He was heavily criticised at the time by some health leaders for failing to mention the workforce crisis.

Labour's Wes Streeting, speaking after the first wave of healthcare strikes, has had some strong words to say about the future of our health service.

He said the NHS was in an ""existential crisis"" - and pledged his party would train more staff, use the private sector to bring down waiting lists, and introduce fair pay and conditions for workers.

But he too has been under fire for outlining the Opposition's proposals for GP reform - saying a Labour government would ""tear up the contract"" with GPs and could make family doctors salaried NHS employees.

Sajid Javid's proposal would see patients charged £20 fees for GP appointments and £66 for emergency visits without a referral. The idea will be met with fierce opposition from frontline medics.

Dr Ed Hartley, the director for emergency medicine at University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire, would resist any moves to charge payments.

He says that would not solve the crisis. Instead, he wants to see reform and investment in key areas like social care and staff recruitment and retention.

""I want to see [extra funding] in social care, I want to see the right size of hospitals ... we've lost thousands of hospital beds over the last decade, but we need to work out as a population what the right number is.

""I want to see system leadership. So, I want to see the NHS working with local authorities, with community health providers, all together to tackle problems, and I want to see long-term investment in the workforce.""

Dr Hartley says extra funding will help to solve many of the health service's problems, but only if it is directed towards long-term solutions.

He said: ""Money in the right places fixes the NHS. Short-term projects - to put a holding pen for ambulances outside the A&E; - don't fix the NHS. Short-term projects to help buy some hotel rooms for care home patients or patients who need to leave hospital don't fix the NHS.

""Long-term investment in the workforce, long-term investment in the right size of hospitals, and recognising the care sector as a rewarding career with progression, and presumably appropriate pay, will go a long way to helping the NHS.""

FUNDING

£277bn was spent on healthcare in the UK in 2021, which is 11.9% of total GDP.

This is compared to 17.8% of GDP in the US, 12.8% in Germany, and 10.8% in Denmark.

In 1948, when the NHS was founded, its annual budget was £373m - 3.2% of GDP at the time.

£152.6bn has been allocated for NHS England and NHS Improvement in 2022/23.

11% (£14.9bn) of £133.7bn day-to-day spending in the year 2021/22 was spent on mental health.

PAY

£35,908 was the average annual full-time salary for an NHS worker for the year ending September 2022.

This was an increase of 4.3% (£1,480) on the previous year. But inflation was 10.1% in September 2022, which means it was a real-terms decrease.

NHS pay is banded from 1 to 9.

Band 1 staff, which include drivers, nursery assistants and domestic support workers, get an annual salary of £20,270.

The hourly rate is £10.37 an hour, which is just over the 2022 National Living Wage of £9.50 for over-23s.

And not just slightly worse. We're talking about scales of magnitude, even compared with just before the pandemic when there had already been a decade of decline.

Ambulances for strokes are three times slower. Forty times more people in A&E wait more than 12 hours for hospital beds to become available before they can be admitted. Over 200 times more people have been waiting a year for routine surgery.

We're going to take you on a journey through each stage of the emergency system, to explain where and why the long waits come in, as well as hearing the stories of people who've been caught up in them.

We're not talking about the extraordinary cases of people waiting whole days for an ambulance. We're not talking about strike days or exceptional circumstances. We're talking about the ordinary, average, frustrating journey for someone seeking emergency care in Britain in 2023.

The average heart attack sufferer in England in December waited an hour-and-a-half before an ambulance got to them.

When that ambulance arrived at the hospital, they waited another half an hour for space in A&E. Then it was four more hours waiting to be assessed by a health professional, and four more waiting for a hospital bed.

That's 10 hours in total, and that's normal.

544;Fathers 'constantly fighting the NHS' to get severely disabled sons the care they need;Thursday 26 January 2023 02:43, UK;[];['nhs'];['wait', 'boys', 'severely', 'need', 'constantly', 'sons', 'fathers', 'children', 'hospital', 'paul', 'fighting', 'disabled', 'family', 'care', 'cant', 'health', 'nhs'];"A father of four has said he is ""constantly fighting the NHS"" to get the care his two severely disabled sons need - and his fears about the future grow as he sees friends in similar situations putting their children into care.

Paul and his husband Michael Atwal-Brice adopted Levi and Lucas when the children were babies.

Now aged 16 and diagnosed with autism and epilepsy - among other disabilities - both parents have had to leave their jobs to care for them full-time.

They also care for Lotan and Lance, twin boys without any disabilities.

""Everything is just a battle with the NHS,"" Paul, from Thurnscoe in South Yorkshire, told Sky News.

""Unless you're prepared to stand up and fight, you get nothing.""

The two teens have been left waiting for NHS care at every stage.

Levi's epilepsy means he requires frequent hospitalisation.

When Paul last had to call an ambulance - while the family were away on holiday - they had to wait 45 minutes, despite the fact Levi was bleeding heavily from the head. He had fallen while having a seizure and hit his head on a door frame.

""Once the seizures had stopped, he gets graded down to a category two, so the wait gets longer.

""Even though we were telling them he can't wait because he won't even let us touch his head and blood was going everywhere. It doesn't matter.

""And this was before the latest strikes and challenges this winter.""

Once they had made it to the hospital, they then had to wait more than four hours in a hospital corridor to be seen.

""It was awful. Levi is severely autistic and non-verbal and he gets upset very easily so he was screaming the corridors down, upsetting other people, but they couldn't move him.""

Image: Paul and Michael have both given up work to care for their children

'Friends are putting their children into care'

Levi and Lucas are both nearing adulthood, which leaves Paul fearing for their future.

""All the services are being cut back,"" he said.

""The health service is a fight and struggle to get anywhere.

""A lot of friends of ours are putting their children into full-time care because they can't cope with all the services being cut back, and this costs thousands and thousands a year to do this, a cost which the NHS has to pick up.

""It doesn't make sense.""

Both boys need appointments every six weeks, but amid growing pressure on the National Health Service, this has been cut back to three months - and is often even six because clinicians cannot fit them in.

""It's disgraceful,"" said Paul. ""Something needs to be done to fix this. These are life-saving appointments for the boys.""

Wendy Lowder, Barnsley executive director for place health and adult social care at NHS South Yorkshire said: ""I'm really saddened about the experiences we've heard about from this family.

""Having a seamless transition between services when you reach 16 is so important to families at this time. Our teams have worked closely with the family to resolve all the issues they have experienced.

""We are now reviewing how the supply of these sorts of items works better for any families in the same situation in the future.""

Two months without food syringes

The teens are very underweight, so they have to be syringe fed fibre drinks from a dietician, but the hospital has said they can't prescribe them any more.

Instead, the family has to get them via the GP.

But a communication breakdown left them without the required food for two months.

""We went to the GP just before Christmas and they didn't know anything about it. They said they couldn't order them either.""

Instead, Paul and Michael had to try and feed them with a plastic IKEA beaker, which turned out to be a ""disaster"".

""They had liquid running down them as they couldn't take the quantity, so there was a lot of waste and upset.

""We were promised we'd have a delivery to the house over Christmas, but it never came.""

South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has been contacted for comment.

A £5,000 energy bill

The family's energy bills are going up £1,500 a year and they are estimated to pay almost £5,000 for their gas and electric in the next 12 months.

""Electric bills are our biggest worry of all.

""They've got to a stage where we can no longer carry them safely up and down stairs so we've had to have a lift fitted in the house. We can't not have that going, it needs to be powered by electricity all the time.

""They have seizures all the time and the lift is literally a lifesaver.""

Meanwhile, the washing machine is constantly running because the boys are incontinent, and bedsheets and clothing have to be changed all the time.

The NHS will only provide four nappies a day to the family: ""This is crazy. How can you tell the boys that they can only wee and poo four times a day? You wouldn't do that to anyone.

""Their beds are electric, they have a therapy bath that also runs on power and their sensory room is full of calming lights and sounds that also cost money.

""In addition to all this, we are now spending £120 on fuel a week.""

545;Leah Croucher murder: Prime suspect may have changed his appearance to avoid being recognised, police say;Thursday 26 January 2023 03:53, UK;[];[];['say', 'avoid', 'saw', 'seen', 'appearance', 'prime', 'suspect', 'leah', 'murder', 'maxwell', 'released', 'croucher', 'changed', 'went', 'likely', 'investigation', 'work', 'recognised', 'remains'];"Police investigating the murder of teenager Leah Croucher have released a new e-fit image of the prime suspect - and said he likely changed his appearance to ""avoid being recognised"".

In a new appeal, Thames Valley Police said convicted sex offender Neil Maxwell is likely to have grown a beard and ""may have lost weight"" to evade capture.

Maxwell was found dead in April 2019 after he took his own life, and detectives are appealing for information so they can confirm he killed the 19-year-old.

Image: Leah Croucher

Leah disappeared on her way to work at a finance company in Milton Keynes on 15 February 2019.

Her remains were discovered more than three years after she went missing in the loft of a house in Furzton in October last year.

The murder investigation is continuing.

In an update, Detective Chief Superintendent Ian Hunter said Maxwell ""knew"" he was wanted in connection with a sexual assault investigation that occurred in 2018 and appeared to have made ""extensive efforts to evade arrest"" by using false names.

""He is likely to have known that he would be returning to prison if he was arrested and convicted.

""The investigation has now also established that Maxwell is likely to have changed his appearance to avoid being recognised. He had grown a beard and may have lost weight.""

Leah vanished as she walked to work and was last seen on CCTV just after 8.15am.

The force released the image of how Maxwell may have looked around the time Leah went missing and is asking members of the public to contact police if they saw him in or around Loxbeare Drive at any time between December 2018 and 20 April 2019.

Police said they still have not identified anyone who saw him or around Milton Keynes since early December 2018.

They are yet to identify anyone who had seen Maxwell in Loxbeare Drive before, after or at any time close to when Leah went missing.

Officers would also like to hear from anyone who knew his mobile phone number, the vehicle he drove - or ""any other useful information that can help us establish the truth for Leah's family"".

Police started searching the property where Leah's remains were discovered after receiving a tip-off from a member of the public.

It has since emerged Maxwell was the only person with keys to the house, which was unoccupied when police were conducting their inquiries.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126040901/https://news.sky.com/story/leah-croucher-murder-prime-suspect-may-have-changed-his-appearance-to-avoid-being-recognised-police-say-12795253

The huge inflatable depicting the former US president in a nappy and clutching a mobile phone underwent a test inflation by the Museum of London to check if it is structurally sound, how long it holds air and to make any small repairs.

It last took to the skies above Parliament Square during protests over Mr Trump's state visit to the UK in June 2019.

The balloon was gifted to the Museum of London in January 2021, and the institution hopes it will go on show at their new home in West Smithfield, which is due to open in 2026.

""It is always a challenge to preserve objects that are meant to be short-lived like the Trump blimp,"" a spokesperson from the Museum of London said.

""It was made to be flown over Parliament Square during the then president Trump's visit to London in 2019 - a quick, flexible and visible icon, as opposed to the permanent statues in Parliament Square made from the much more durable materials.

""Plastics age and break down in sometimes unexpected ways, so this will help us establish how we can best preserve it in the long-term as part of our collection.""

547;'Absolutely disgusting': Life insurance firm uses picture of serial killer Harold Shipman in advert;Thursday 26 January 2023 04:02, UK;[];['leicester'];['know', 'insurance', 'provocative', 'intention', 'advert', 'firm', 'serial', 'disgusting', 'picture', 'knowles', 'uses', 'shocking', 'life', 'killer', 'harold', 'shipman'];"A life insurance firm has been criticised after running an advert featuring Harold Shipman.

DeadHappy, a Leicester-based firm with a reputation for shocking adverts, used a picture of the serial killer alongside the text ""Life insurance: Because you never know who your doctor might be.""

The commercial, which was run on social media, was branded ""tasteless"" and ""disgusting"" online.

Shipman, who worked as a GP for decades, was convicted of 15 murders in 1998 but is suspected to have potentially killed as many as 250 people between 1975 and 1998.

He hanged himself in prison in 2004.

Kathryn Knowles, founder of insurance broker Cura, said on Twitter she would report the ""absolutely disgusting"" advert to the Financial Conduct Authority and the advertising watchdog.

She said: ""There is a firm that is promoting life insurance using the picture of a mass murderer to promote their services.

""I will name neither as I won't give them the satisfaction of popping up in more search results. Please know that many of us in insurance find this beyond despicable.

Ms Knowles added: ""I would hope the FCA and ASA would would take action on this. I would like to lodge a formal complaint to both over this advert and will provide a copy to them.""

A family member of one of the victims did see the advert and said: ""As someone who's relative was murdered by Harold Shipman, your latest advert utilising his image is despicable and unacceptable.

""I hope you enjoy yet another judgement from ASA and change your practices.""

In a statement, the firm's founder Andy Knott said: ""We are called DeadHappy and our strapline is 'Life insurance to die for' so we are aware of the provocative and to some the very shocking nature of our brand.

""But being provocative is different to being offensive and it is of course never our intention to offend or upset people. It is our intention to make people stop and think.

""If however you have been personally distressed by this advert we do sincerely apologise.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126040901/https://news.sky.com/story/absolutely-disgusting-life-insurance-firm-uses-picture-of-serial-killer-harold-shipman-in-advert-12795640
548;Woman charged with robbing mobility scooter, as police investigate the victim's death;Thursday 26 January 2023 04:06, UK;[];[];['victims', 'shortly', 'road', 'death', 'scooter', 'charged', 'force', 'man', 'woman', 'investigate', 'robbing', 'mobility', 'stratford', 'stroud'];"A 40-year-old woman has been charged with robbing a man of his mobility scooter in Stroud, police have said.

The man, in his 60s, died shortly after the incident.

Gloucestershire Police said he was found unresponsive in a Tesco superstore car park on Stratford Road in the early hours of Sunday.

His black mobility scooter was absent, and he died later that day after being taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital by paramedics.

On Wednesday evening, the force said: ""Kimberley Ann Hawkins, 40 and of no fixed address, has been charged with robbing a man aged in his 60s of a motorised mobility scooter in the area of Stratford Road on 22 January.""

They said she had been remanded in police custody and will appear at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on Thursday.

On Monday, police said a woman from Stroud had been arrested on suspicion of robbery and murder and was in police custody.

The victim's four-wheeled scooter was found abandoned on Bisley Old Road by a member of the public shortly before 8am on Sunday.

A post-mortem returned inconclusive results about the cause of the man's death, and an investigation is ongoing, police said.

549;How well do you understand what's going on in the NHS?;Thursday 26 January 2023 04:25, UK;[];['data and forensics'];['wait', 'whats', 'sky', 'data', 'increased', 'treatment', 'delays', 'waiting', 'understand', 'elective', 'journalism', 'going', 'nhs'];"The NHS has faced a winter like no other. Each month has broken new records on waiting times, ambulance delays or bed shortages.

The waiting list for elective treatments, such as hip replacements and chemotherapy, has grown rapidly since the Covid-19 pandemic. How many people are now waiting over a year for treatment?

The increase has been particularly substantial for certain types of treatment. In November 2019, just 1.1% of people seeking brain surgery had to wait over a year for treatment. By November 2022, that share had increased to 12.6%.

Other areas of treatment, like gynaecology, have also seen significant increases in waiting times.

It's not just elective patients who are enduring lengthier waits. Ambulance response times for urgent calls, such as heart attacks and strokes, have increased significantly. The NHS target is for all such callers to be reached within 18 minutes. How long does it actually take, as of December?

Once a patient gets to A&E; there are even more delays. The target is that no more than 5% of people should be there for more than four hours.

Once a patient has been assessed by an A&E; doctor, they have to wait for a bed to become available - sometimes for more than 12 hours. How many people have to wait this long?

A chronic shortage of beds is a key factor behind delays across the health service - holding up admissions for elective treatment and forcing ambulances to spend hours queuing up outside A&E; departments. How many beds does the NHS have?

There are also fewer managers in the NHS now than there were a decade ago, despite an ageing and increasing population. What's happened to the number of doctors?

In November, the government increased the NHS budget by £3.3bn for the next two years. But analysis shared exclusively with Sky News found that almost all of the increase will be taken up by rising prices and growing demand.

In coalition with the King's Fund, Nuffield Trust and the Health Foundation, Sky News is launching a new year-long project to examine the NHS at 75, the problems it faces and the potential solutions.

And not just slightly worse. We're talking about scales of magnitude, even compared with just before the pandemic when there had already been a decade of decline.

Ambulances for strokes are three times slower. Forty times more people in A&E wait more than 12 hours for hospital beds to become available before they can be admitted. Over 200 times more people have been waiting a year for routine surgery.

We're going to take you on a journey through each stage of the emergency system, to explain where and why the long waits come in, as well as hearing the stories of people who've been caught up in them.

We're not talking about the extraordinary cases of people waiting whole days for an ambulance. We're not talking about strike days or exceptional circumstances. We're talking about the ordinary, average, frustrating journey for someone seeking emergency care in Britain in 2023.

The average heart attack sufferer in England in December waited an hour-and-a-half before an ambulance got to them.

When that ambulance arrived at the hospital, they waited another half an hour for space in A&E. Then it was four more hours waiting to be assessed by a health professional, and four more waiting for a hospital bed.

That's 10 hours in total, and that's normal.

In an exclusive interview with Kay Burley, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he ""doesn't understand who makes decisions in Russia"" and that while Moscow asks for peace, it lies by attacking Ukraine with missiles.

Mr Zelenskyy also responded to speculation of a Russian offensive in Ukraine in the coming weeks, and recalled how he felt when he realised the invasion was beginning last year.

When asked whether a meeting with Mr Putin would help to resolve the war, Mr Zelenskyy said: ""It is not interesting for me. Not interesting to meet, not interesting to speak... I really don't understand who makes decisions in Russia.""

The president said people are his number one priority, adding: ""I don't want to fight on Russian territory.

""I just want them to stop the war as quickly as possible, and leave our country as fast as possible.

""I can tell you for sure if they leave our territory, the war will stop. That's all.""

When asked whether it was too late for talks, Mr Zelenskyy said: ""After a full-scale invasion, for me [Mr Putin] is nobody.""

'Russia losing a lot of people'

As speculation of a Russian surge mounts, Mr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces have been observing the situation in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Bakhmut in Donetsk.

The president said there have been more powerful attacks and offensives in recent days - and that it is crucial for Ukrainian forces to have defensive strength.

He added: ""It all depends on how much we can hold them back... In the east they are moving forward and losing a lot of people. It's just an extraordinary number. They don't care about it. I mean, they don't count their people. This is a fact.

""We are counting their people. But we don't have exact numbers. There are much more casualties from their side. But from what we have already seen and counted, there are thousands of people dead from their side, and they are just throwing them, and throwing them, and throwing them and throwing them.""

The frontline city of Bakhmut, where Russia's Wagner mercenaries and Ukrainian forces have been locked in battle, has witnessed months of fierce fighting.

'Thankful for tanks'

During the interview - filmed on Mr Zelenskyy's 45th birthday - the Ukrainian president learnt that Germany had decided to send 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Kyiv after weeks of indecision.

He told Sky News that he was ""very thankful"" for the tanks but warned that the quantity and delivery time of the vehicles is ""critical"".

Washington also announced yesterday that it would send 31 M1 Abrams tanks vehicles to Kyiv after Germany's promise.

The US had previously resisted sending its own vehicles to Ukraine.

The Abrams is one of America's most powerful tanks. The total cost of a single Abrams can vary, and can be more than $10m (£8m) per tank when including training and sustainment.

The UK became the first Western nation to promise main battle tanks when Rishi Sunak pledged 14 Challenger 2s this month.

After a workplace accident at work in 1999 smashed up his knee, Derek Wilson didn't expect he'd still be trying to get treatment 24 years on.

Mr Wilson fell off a wall at work and was operated on shortly afterwards, but said his knee has never been the same. A short time after his accident he went to see his GP, who said he might need a knee replacement but to go back when the condition had deteriorated a bit more.

Since then, he has been on and off waiting lists for an operation, but he's never had it done. Just before COVID, he went to see a consultant who took him off the waiting list involuntarily because he didn't meet the criteria for a knee replacement.



""I'm very angry because he didn't examine me and judged me on the way I walked into the room,"" he told Sky News.

""I've been on very very strong painkillers for a long time.

""Without Fentonil patches, I wouldn't be mobile, but he didn't even look at my notes to see this. Shortly after this, COVID happened and no one could get an appointment with a doctor. The problem is, once you get discharged, it's impossible to get back in the system.""

Mr Wilson's pain has increased substantially since then, but it's almost impossible to get an appointment with his GP, so he's going to go private - and he said he doesn't feel like he has a choice.

""Unless I go and stand outside the doctors and wait for the surgery to open, I can't get to speak to anyone. Even getting a telephone appointment is virtually impossible. If you phone up in the morning you're in a queue, to get in a queue,"" he said.

""By the time you get to speak with anyone an hour and a half later, all the appointments all gone. Unless you know how to complain, you can't get anywhere with our current system. The system is broken. It doesn't work.""

Mr Wilson is also diabetic. His GP stopped his medication because it gave him a severe upset stomach, but they didn't re-prescribe him anything to help with his diabetes. He was very poorly, but still couldn't get through to speak to a doctor.

""It's a free-for-all at 8am. You're in competition with everyone else, so I ended up having to walk down to the surgery to wait outside for them to open at 7:30am just to speak to a receptionist.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:34 Why does Ukraine need new tanks?

On tanks

The president explained that Russian tanks vastly outnumber the vehicles that Ukrainian forces have at their disposal.

Mr Zelenskyy, who learned of Germany's decision to send Leopard 2 tanks during his Sky News interview, said he wanted to thank Europe and the US - but added that they couldn't waste any time in getting them to the frontline.

He said: ""We need 300 or 500 tanks now. That's why I believe that we need tanks to carry out an offensive on our territory, on our land. We need armoured vehicles to protect our people, that's all.

""I am very happy and I would like to thank Germany, thank Britain, and thank the United States that they made such decisions. Overall I am grateful to the world for their support of Ukraine.

""But if we are talking frankly and honestly with you, the number of tanks and delivery time are of crucial and critical importance, in comparison to the decision that has been made. We have approved cases of weapons to be sent to us, but we still haven't received them.

""Sometimes the delivery of the weapons takes months, you understand? I don't blame anyone, but, in response to your question, a sense of relief comes only after the weapons, which our partners give us, are already being used by our army.""

On fighting the Russians

Mr Zelenskyy explained he had no designs on taking territory in Russia, saying all he wanted was for Moscow's forces to leave Ukraine.

He said: ""We are not fighting on Russian territory, because we are not interested in it. We are just not interested in it.

""Because the war, wherever it is, means losing people. For me, people are the number one priority. That's why I don't want to fight on Russian territory.

""I just want them to stop the war as quickly as possible and leave our country as fast as possible.

""I can tell you for sure if they leave our territory the war will stop. That's all.""

On peace talks with Putin

Mr Zelenskyy said that peace talks with Russia while Vladimir Putin is still president would be pointless.

He said: ""You know, so far there are no peace talks with Russia ... because we don't know who we should negotiate with, and about what. What kind of peace talks?

""At present, these are just criminals who came here and were killing and raping. That's what they have been doing.

""They don't want any talks, and this was the case before the invasion. President Putin decided so. I am convinced that Ukraine is just the first step for him. I am convinced that he is waging a big war.

""And having the whole world helping Ukraine now - he is not thinking about that. He is thinking 'Well, it's not working out in Ukraine now but we will wait ... the world won't stay united, they will get tired and I will move further.'

""But after Ukraine there will be further steps, there will be other countries, if we fail to withstand.""

Germany to send 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine

What are Leopard 2 battle tanks?

The president added that, before the invasion, Putin never met for talks because he had no intention of preserving peace, saying: ""He was just trying to mislead us. He doesn't want negotiations because he doesn't want peace. He can slow down things.

""They were sending messages about peace talks, and we have proof of it, only when they needed time to regroup on the battlefield.

""When they had huge losses, they were saying that they wanted peace. This is a lie. We saw them say that they wanted peace and then they would strike with missiles at night.

""We hope that once Russia pulls its troops back to their territory, they will admit their big mistakes, and there will be a new government in the Russian Federation. We are neighbours. It will be only then that we will be resolving this situation. Then, probably, talks will be possible.""

On Boris Johnson

Asked if he would welcome Boris Johnson as the UK's special envoy to Ukraine, he enthusiastically agreed - describing the former PM as a ""good guy"".

But when asked if he would support Mr Johnson if he ran to be prime minister again, Mr Zelenskyy was more diplomatic, saying: ""I think that is not correct to me to support Johnson to be prime minister when Rishi is prime minister, it's not correct, I'm sorry, totally.""

On never losing his sense of humour

Before a life of politics and war, Mr Zelenskyy was an actor and comedian.

When asked about the importance of keeping his sense of humour, he said: ""I never lost my sense of humour.

""I think when people lose it, they lose ... state of mind. I think so. You have to concentrate and be very serious not during months.

""You have to do it in very important moments, in very difficult decisions, you have to be clever and you have to be adequate and you have to be brave because you are the leader.

""You have to be strong and that's why sense of humour shows, when you can joke, show sometimes of course, show that you are okay, that you are strong, that you control the situation.

""It's very important to control the situation. And that's it. Nobody can make decisions without you. Because then the result, so, I mean, the result depends on you.

An audience of Northern political leaders - here in Manchester to demand a greater share of government funding, and a commitment to enshrine the principle of regional equality - in law.

Facing them on stage, two senior politicians from opposing parties - each pitching a very different interpretation of levelling up.

Michael Gove is the Conservative with the current mandate to deliver on a commitment which was such a central plank of Boris Johnson's 2019 election winning manifesto.

His opposite number - Labour's Lisa Nandy - believes the government has entirely failed to deliver on that promise.

Last week the government announced the winners of the latest round of levelling up funding - dishing out £2.1bn to projects around the country.

But the fund was heavily oversubscribed, and many who left out felt very hard done by - particularly when analysis showed London and the South East had benefited more than the North East (the government argues overall spending per person is greater in the North).

Ms Nandy described it as a ""Hunger Games -style"" contest, pitting communities against each other.

Even the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, decried the ""begging bowl culture"" of the fund, urging the government to provide regional leaders with longer term devolved funding settlements instead.

Michael Gove's speech was in one sense his attempt to hit back at this criticism, and a declaration of faith in the principle of levelling up - which he argues is a ""moral and economic imperative"".

He told delegates the north/south divide is a profound weakness, arguing that while the success of London makes it a ""priceless asset"", the country should not rely so entirely on one region.

""Like a football team with one star striker, even Lionel Messi can't do it alone,"" he joked. ""The strength of the country depends on strength and depth.""

It's unlikely anyone in the audience disagreed with this analogy - but there were certainly rumblings of disquiet from delegates leaving the hall later in response to Mr Gove's decision to evoke the spirit of Margaret Thatcher as an inspiration for levelling up- with the successful 1980s regeneration of London's docklands.

Those hoping for any major announcements were disappointed, although there was a promise of more power over affordable house building and £30m towards housing improvements for the mayors of Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, as well as a third, simplified, round of levelling up funding to be announced after the March budget.

Mr Gove also pledged that every area that wants a devolution deal will get one by 2030.

His speech was 40 minutes long and packed full of detail. Ms Nandy's was shorter, but punchier.

Labour, she said, would change the whole ""broken"" political system, arguing that the country's ability to deal with problems ""all come back to one thing - the fact we have written off the talent and potential of most people in this country"".

Her quip that Northern Powerhouse Rail would already be up and running if it had been handed over to northern leaders to deliver earned her a loud cheer (the audience of course predominantly made up of the very northern leaders in question).

Ms Nandy went on to pledge that a future Labour government would rewrite the way local funding is allocated, so that the national finances would follow behind local funding needs.

Clearly, Labour's vision for levelling up goes much further than what the Tories have in mind.

Fundamentally however, with Rachel Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer insisting that all Labour funding pledges will be fully costed, it doesn't seem there would be any new funding available to Ms Nandy to dish out, if she ever becomes the secretary of state in future.

And while the leaders of the North will be glad their calls for greater power are being heard - the question of how much difference these big administrative changes will ultimately make to the lives of millions of local people without a huge boost in investment remains to be seen.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126080207/http://news.sky.com/story/politics-news-latest-rishi-sunak-heads-for-cabinet-away-day-at-chequers-as-trip-branded-hideaway-day-by-opposition-party-12593360

The relative near miss will be streamed live using robotic telescopes - here's what you need to know about the asteroid and how you can watch it.

What do we know about this asteroid?

The asteroid was first spotted on 21 January and has been named asteroid 2023 BU.

It is due to whizz past Earth shortly after midnight on Friday 27 January.

When it passes by at its closest point it will be 3,500km above Earth's surface. That's less than 3% of the average distance between the Earth and the moon.

It may sound like a long way, but this asteroid will be the fourth closest to pass by Earth since records began.

By comparison, most satellites orbit at an altitude of more than 35,000km.

Should I be worried about the asteroid crashing to Earth?

In short, no. The asteroid is between 3.8 and 8.4 metres in size - small enough to incinerate on entering Earth's atmosphere.

Apparently it's roughly the size of an elephant.

According to NASA, asteroids smaller than 25m are likely to burn up, leading to little or no damage on the ground.

The Virtual Telescope Project will be broadcasting the close encounter live from 7.15pm on Thursday 26 January.

The Virtual Telescope Project is run by the Bellatrix Astronomical Observatory in Italy and consists of several robotic telescopes that are accessible online.

What is an asteroid?

An asteroid is a ""relatively small, inactive body orbiting the Sun"", according to NASA. It's normally made of rocky, dusty, and metallic materials.

Most orbit within the main asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but some follow paths that circulate into the inner solar system (including near-Earth asteroids).

A NASA website displays the next five asteroid approaches expected near Earth, showing how they are typically extremely far away.

A total of 706 children needed treatment for the life-threatening disorder, which is one of the leading causes of heart disease in under fives across the UK, latest annual figures from NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) show.

The new statistics compare to an average of only 336 children each year needing treatment for the condition for the past five years.

Children with the illness can require immunoglobulin - a medicine made from plasma - in order to get better.

If Kawasaki disease is left untreated or it's not caught in time, it can be fatal.

""Immunoglobulin is a precious resource as it is a crucial medicine for the treatment of Kawasaki disease,"" said Dr Jethro Herberg, clinical reader in paediatric infectious disease, from Imperial College London.

""We absolutely need to ensure a safe supply, and members of the public who donate plasma for immunoglobulin are making a greatly needed, and much appreciated contribution.""

One of those children to have received such an important donation is Bella Hessey, who developed Kawasaki disease as a baby.

Initially misdiagnosed with an ear and throat infection, Bella went on to develop bulges in the blood vessels around her heart.

One of her arteries, which should have been 1mm to 2mm wide, was stretched to as big as 12mm.

Mum Abigail Baker, 26, said the right treatment made a difference for her daughter straightaway.

""The immunoglobulin's effect was instant. Straightaway, her colour came back to normal.

""By the next morning she was eating again and her fever had completely gone. It saved her life,"" Abigail said.

She added: ""You see comments online from people all over the world trying to get hold of immunoglobulin because it's expensive.

""It's very important that people can donate again in England so we can have a more secure supply here, especially because treatment for Kawasaki disease is time restricted.""

Bella fully recovered from the illness and is now a healthy three-year-old.

'Please consider donating - it could save someone's life'

Despite the importance of immunoglobulin as a treatment, only 5,850 plasma donors are currently registered - just over half of the 10,200 needed.

""There is a rising need for plasma donors to help treat life-threatening immune disorders such as Kawasaki disease. You can help by donating plasma or blood - you have a medicine in you,"" said Gerry Gogarty, director of Plasma for Medicines at NHS Blood and Transplant.

Plasma - the liquid part of blood - is rich in infection-fighting antibodies, which are concentrated into immunoglobulin medicine.

This stabilises the immune response and reduces inflammation.

Between 1998 and 2021, plasma from UK donors could not be used for immunoglobulin as a precautionary measure, which meant the country relied on imported immunoglobulin.

However, international supplies have since come under increasing pressures and shortages.

In 2021, the government decided plasma collection for immunoglobulin should restart in England.

Now, the NHS is taking dedicated plasma donations in Twickenham, Reading and Birmingham.

""More plasma donors are needed to treat Kawasaki disease and we are working closely with NHS Blood and Transplant to boost supplies so we can provide the best possible care to patients,"" said health minister Neil O'Brien.

Even the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, decried the ""begging bowl culture"" of the fund, urging the government to provide regional leaders with longer term devolved funding settlements instead.

Michael Gove's speech was in one sense his attempt to hit back at this criticism, and a declaration of faith in the principle of levelling up - which he argues is a ""moral and economic imperative"".

He told delegates the north/south divide is a profound weakness, arguing that while the success of London makes it a ""priceless asset"", the country should not rely so entirely on one region.

""Like a football team with one star striker, even Lionel Messi can't do it alone,"" he joked. ""The strength of the country depends on strength and depth.""

It's unlikely anyone in the audience disagreed with this analogy - but there were certainly rumblings of disquiet from delegates leaving the hall later in response to Mr Gove's decision to evoke the spirit of Margaret Thatcher as an inspiration for levelling up- with the successful 1980s regeneration of London's docklands.

Those hoping for any major announcements were disappointed, although there was a promise of more power over affordable house building and £30m towards housing improvements for the mayors of Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, as well as a third, simplified, round of levelling up funding to be announced after the March budget.

Mr Gove also pledged that every area that wants a devolution deal will get one by 2030.

His speech was 40 minutes long and packed full of detail. Ms Nandy's was shorter, but punchier.

Labour, she said, would change the whole ""broken"" political system, arguing that the country's ability to deal with problems ""all come back to one thing - the fact we have written off the talent and potential of most people in this country"".

Her quip that Northern Powerhouse Rail would already be up and running if it had been handed over to northern leaders to deliver earned her a loud cheer (the audience of course predominantly made up of the very northern leaders in question).

Ms Nandy went on to pledge that a future Labour government would rewrite the way local funding is allocated, so that the national finances would follow behind local funding needs.

Clearly, Labour's vision for levelling up goes much further than what the Tories have in mind.

Fundamentally however, with Rachel Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer insisting that all Labour funding pledges will be fully costed, it doesn't seem there would be any new funding available to Ms Nandy to dish out, if she ever becomes the secretary of state in future.

And while the leaders of the North will be glad their calls for greater power are being heard - the question of how much difference these big administrative changes will ultimately make to the lives of millions of local people without a huge boost in investment remains to be seen.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126080207/http://news.sky.com/story/politics-news-latest-rishi-sunak-heads-for-cabinet-away-day-at-chequers-as-trip-branded-hideaway-by-opposition-party-12593360

Manson's legal representative Howard King also confirmed the agreement, with the rock musician maintaining the allegations against him were ""provably false"" and ""simply never happened"".

This is the third lawsuit to be dropped against Manson, 54, after his former assistant and a model filed similar allegations.

Bianco alleged Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England in 2009 and 2011, under false pretences that she would star in music videos and films.

He deprived the actress of food and sleep, locked her in a bedroom, whipped her, gave her electric shocks and threatened to enter her room and rape her during the night, the lawsuit alleged.

Manson is also suing his former fiancée Evan Rachel Wood for defamation, saying she has cast him as a ""rapist and abuser"".

He is alleging the Westworld actress conspired with a friend to use false allegations and pretences to get other women to come forward.

The relative near miss will be streamed live using robotic telescopes - here's what you need to know about the asteroid and how you can watch it.

What do we know about this asteroid?

The asteroid was first spotted on 21 January and has been named asteroid 2023 BU.

It is due to whizz past Earth shortly after midnight on Friday 27 January.

When it passes by at its closest point it will be 3,500km above Earth's surface. That's less than 3% of the average distance between the Earth and the moon.

It may sound like a long way, but this asteroid will be the fourth closest to pass by Earth since records began.

By comparison, most satellites orbit at an altitude of more than 35,000km.

Should I be worried about the asteroid crashing to Earth?

In short, no. The asteroid is between 3.8 and 8.4 metres in size - small enough to incinerate on entering Earth's atmosphere.

Apparently it's roughly the size of an elephant.

According to NASA, asteroids smaller than 25m are likely to burn up, leading to little or no damage on the ground.

The Virtual Telescope Project is run by the Bellatrix Astronomical Observatory in Italy and consists of several robotic telescopes that are accessible online.

What is an asteroid?

An asteroid is a ""relatively small, inactive body orbiting the Sun"", according to NASA. It's normally made of rocky, dusty, and metallic materials.

Most orbit within the main asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but some follow paths that circulate into the inner solar system (including near-Earth asteroids).

570;UK car production slumps to 66-year low but improvement expected ahead;Thursday 26 January 2023 08:11, UK;['james sillars', '@skynewsbiz'];[];['production', 'drive', 'low', 'ahead', '66year', 'investment', 'improvement', 'car', 'supply', 'vehicles', 'chain', 'slumps', 'smmt', 'expected', 'electric', 'uk', '2022'];"UK car production fell to its lowest level since 1956 last year, according to industry figures showing that the global shortage of parts continued to drag on performance.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) had already reported how the sale of new vehicles in 2022 was severely damaged by the lack of key components, particularly semiconductor chips.

COVID-led supply chain disruption harmed the ability of UK factories to drive availability to meet demand, though there is optimism the worst is now behind the sector.

Although 2022 will not be considered a success, there was limited progress in efforts to produce more zero emission or more climate-friendly vehicles as the clock ticks down towards the 2030 ban on the sale of new cars powered by diesel and petrol.

A total of 775,014 cars were built in 2022, the SMMT said.

That was down almost 10% from the 859,575 made during the previous year and 40.5% below pre-COVID crisis levels in 2019.

The SMMT said the figures were distorted by the closure of Honda's factory in Swindon in July 2021 and the decision by Stellantis to stop producing the Vauxhall Astra in Ellesmere Port in April 2022 to produce electric vans instead.

The bright spark was the production of 234,066 fully electric, or battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and hybrid (HEV) electric vehicles.

It was a record total, with combined production up 4.5% versus 2021.

Hybrids and BEVs accounted for 30.2% of all car production, the SMMT said.

Independent forecasts suggest the reopening of the Chinese economy from COVID restrictions should help drive a 15% increase in UK output this year as crucial chips become more readily available.

There are challenges.

These include the risk of investment flowing to the United States due to heavy government subsidies.

The collapse of the Britishvolt electric vehicle battery start-up has also raised fears over the domestic supply chain ahead of the 2030 deadline.

Image: Britishvolt's plans were sunk by financial problems

Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: ""The potential for this sector to deliver economic growth by building more of these zero-emission models is self-evident; however, we must make the right decisions now.

""This means shaping a strategy to drive rapid upscaling of UK battery production and the shift to electric vehicles based on the UK automotive sector's fundamental strengths - a highly skilled and flexible workforce, engineering excellence, technical innovation and productivity levels that are among the best in Europe.""

A government spokesperson said of the state of affairs: ""We are determined to ensure the UK remains one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing.

""Our success is evidenced by the £1bn investment in Sunderland in 2021, and we are building on this through a major investment programme to electrify our supply chain and create jobs.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126082455/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-car-production-slumps-to-66-year-low-but-acceleration-expected-ahead-12795661

While both the Kremlin and Russian commentators had warned of dire repercussions if the West did agree to send tanks to Ukraine, the response to the news that was now happening has been more muted than those threats might have suggested.

The Institute for the Study of War think-tank detailed statements made by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, who said the provision of Abrams and Leopard tanks to Ukraine was ""quite a failure … in terms of technological aspects"" and that there is a ""clear overestimation of the potential that [these tanks] will add"".

The analysis added: ""Some Russian milbloggers likely sought to reassure their domestic audiences by claiming that these systems do not pose a significant threat and that previous Western systems like HIMARS are a far more serious threat.

""The Kremlin and Russian milbloggers previously framed the Western provision of purely defensive Patriot missile systems as a serious escalation between Russia and the West.

""The Kremlin and Russian milbloggers seem more concerned in this case with calming potential fears of the impact of Western commitments to supply Ukraine with tanks than with feeding the escalation narrative in the West.""

The analysis concluded that ""the Kremlin and its allies are right to be concerned about these new Western commitments, which allow Ukrainian commanders to plan against replacements for tank losses they could expect in counter-offensive operations that might be launched even before the Western tanks begin to arrive.""

The Brazilian failed a breath test, which showed he had 43mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath when the legal limit is 35mg.

District Judge Paul Currer fined him £29,000 and banned him from driving for 12 months, which will be reduced to nine months if he completes a rehabilitation course.

The judge calculated the fine on his weekly wage, which is £43,000.

He must also pay a £2,000 surcharge and £85 costs.

Charged as Joelinton Cassio, and living in Ponteland, Northumberland, he wore a dark suit, white shirt and black tie and was accompanied to Newcastle Magistrates' Court by a club security official.

Prosecuting, Jonathan Stirland, said officers saw his car driving at speed near the football ground, and asked him to stop - to which Joelinton obliged, telling them he drank two glasses of wine earlier in the evening.

Defending, Geoffrey Forester added: ""He will be subject of disciplinary proceedings within the club once this process has concluded.""

Judge Currer told the court he took the footballer's early guilty plea, and his compliance with police, into consideration, adding he was convinced that player was remorseful.

Efforts to find Sands have been ongoing for two weeks, after he went missing in the Baldy Bowl area of the San Gabriel mountains in southern California on 13 January.

However, the high-ground search has been delayed due to poor conditions, with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department adding that so far, ground and aerial searches have provided no evidence of Sands's location.

However, another missing hiker was found alive in the same area that Sands went missing.

The sheriff's department said in a statement: ""Numerous ground and air search efforts have taken place. As of this time, Mr Sands has not been found and no evidence of his current location has been discovered.

""The search will continue, weather and ground conditions permitting.""

Ministers want to revise drug misuse laws to allow people found with nitrous oxide gas in public to be prosecuted.

The party drug, commonly known as laughing gas, is the second most commonly used drug among 16 to 24-year-olds in England after cannabis and there are concerns about health problems caused by its usage.

Politics live: Rishi Sunak heads for cabinet away day at Chequers as trip branded 'hideaway'

""There is a clear view that we have to act,"" a Home Office source said.

""There is a clear link between the use of nitrous oxide and anti-social behaviour and this is a top priority for the government.""

Only those with a ""legitimate reason"" would be exempt from the ban, such as chefs who use it in products liked whipped cream or doctors using it for pain relief.

Those with a legitimate reason to possess the drug may be required to obtain a licence, though ministers are said to be keen on ""avoiding bureaucracy"", the source said.

Current legislation bans the knowing or reckless supply of nitrous oxide for inhalation, but there have been calls for a ban on all direct consumer sales as part of a tightening up of the law.

The substance is already being reviewed by the independent Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, but policing minister Chris Philp wants this to be fast-tracked to April with the hope a formal announcement could be made as part of the government's anti-social behaviour strategy due later this year.

The punishment for being caught is likely to be similar to sentences for class C drugs, with those in possession facing up to two years in prison or an unlimited fine and those supplying the drug facing a maximum 14-year sentence.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wants to speed up a crackdown as he believes tackling anti-social behaviour is key to winning the next election, according to The Times which first reported on the story.

The newspaper said Home Secretary Suella Braverman also backs the move and has privately been pushing for more enforcement action on low-level drugs.

The Newport News School Board voted five-to-one to relieve George Parker III of his duties - but as part of a separation agreement, he'll be paid more than $502,000 (£405,063) in severance - two years of his current base salary of $251,000 (£202,531).

It comes after Abigail Zwerner, 25, was shot in the hand and chest at Richneck Elementary School.

Six-year-old boy shoots teacher during 'altercation' inside US classroom

Concerned teachers and employees, including Ms Zwerner, are said to have warned school administrators three times that the boy had a gun and was threatening other students.

The teacher also sent a text to a loved one, hours before she was shot, that ""showed her frustration"" at the school, a source told NBC.

Ms Zwerner's lawyer Diane Toscano said administrators were ""paralysed by apathy"" as they failed to alert police or remove the boy.

She said on the day of the shooting they ""could not be bothered"" and told one employee to ""wait the situation out, because the school day was almost over"".

An hour later, ""Abby Zwerner was shot in front of those horrified kids, and the school and community are living the nightmare, all because the school administration failed to act"", Ms Toscano said.

She also revealed Ms Zwerner will sue the district.

'Elephant in the room'

School board chairwoman Lisa Surles-Law said Mr Parker, who had been in the role for nearly five years, was a ""capable division leader"" but the decision was based ""on the future trajectory and needs of our school division"".

One school board member, Gary Hunter, was ""perplexed"" by Mr Parker's removal. He defended Mr Parker's prior evaluations adding that ""getting someone new is not going to fix the problem"".

""This problem is not a Newport News problem,"" he said. ""The big elephant in the room is the gun.""

Student was under a care plan

Lawyers representing the boy's family told reporters that his mother legally purchased the gun used in the shooting and that it was kept up high in the family home, and had a trigger lock that required a key.

They said the boy has an ""acute disability"" and was under a care plan ""that included his mother or father attending school with him and accompanying him to class every day"".

The week of the shooting was the first when a parent was not in class with him, the family said.

The British grime star, who is up for three gongs at the ceremony, joins previously announced stars including Harry Styles, Lizzo, Sam Smith and Kim Petras, and Wet Leg.

Following his three previous Brits wins, Stormzy is this year up for artist of the year, best album, and best hip-hop/grime/rap act.

One of the biggest British stars of recent years, all of his three albums have all been chart-toppers, and in 2019 he became the first black British solo artist to headline Glastonbury.

The announcement of Stormzy's performance this year follows controversy around the nominations, with an all-male best artist of the year list leading to questions being raised about the newly introduced gender-neutral categories.

Stormzy is up for the award alongside Styles, George Ezra, Central Cee and Fred Again.

Defending the nomination choices, the awards said that while the lack of female nominees was ""disappointing"", it was down to 2022 seeing ""fewer high-profile women artists in cycle with major releases"" than in 2021.

Why were the male and female artist categories scrapped?

Organisers reportedly plan to evaluate their decision to adopt gender-neutral prizes as part of their annual review after the upcoming ceremony, which takes place on a Saturday for the first time this year, on 11 February.

The Brits announced that male and female award categories would be scrapped ahead of the 2022 ceremony, going gender-neutral in an attempt to make the awards more inclusive.

Adele won the inaugural best artist prize and cleaned up with three awards.

Picking up the best artist award, the star told the crowd that while she understood why the gendered prizes had been dropped, she loved being a female artist and wanted to celebrate women. ""I am really proud of us,"" she said.

Stormzy last performed at the Brits in 2020, when he also picked up the award for best male artist, before the categories were changed.

With only four nominations out of a possible 25 in mixed categories going to women that year, he paid tribute to the women in his team as he collected his award.

""To be the best male, I have got the most incredible females in my team,"" he said. ""You lot are the greatest, the best male is nothing without the best females. I love you guys.""

Some positive news for the NHS now, with the latest data indicating improvements have been made in some areas of the health service.

Ambulance handover delays outside hospitals in England are continuing to get shorter and have dropped to a new low for this winter, according to NHS data released today.

A total of 20% of ambulance patients waited at least 30 minutes last week to be handed to A&E teams, down from 23% the previous week.

The figure hit a record 44% in the week to January 1.

Some 7% of patients waited more than an hour last week to be handed over to A&E teams – again, the lowest so far this winter, and down week-on-week from 9%.



However, the weekly winter data shows ambulances transported more patients to A&Es across the country compared to the week before – 77,937 up from 72,009.

GP appointments

Total number of people in England waiting more than four weeks for a GP appointment has fallen for a second consecutive month, from 1.36 million in November to 1.01 million in December.

That's partly because there were fewer appointments than previous months (26.7m, down from 31.2m last month), but not entirely.

Sky News data journalist Ben van der Merwe said: ""If we look at the government's targets, there's also been an improvement at the national level.

""The share of urgent appointments being conducted on the same day has continued its incremental increase, rising from 68.8% in November to 73.8% in December (up from 68.1% in September).

""The share of people waiting over two weeks for a non-urgent appointments has also improved, falling from 19.8% in November to 17.6% in December (down from a recent high of 22.3% in October).

""There have been improvements in meeting both targets across all NHS regions. All Integrated Care Boards have seen improvements in tackling urgent appointments on the same day, while all but three have improved access to non-urgent appointments.

""At the practice level, the picture is more mixed, with about 18% seeing worsened performance on non-urgent appointments and 11% deteriorating on urgent appointments.

Deterioration on urgent appointments is particularly bad for Newcastle Central Health PCN (76% done on same day in November, down to 45% in December).""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126110738/https://news.sky.com/story/nhs-latest-new-cancer-treatment-approved-as-ambulance-service-facing-catastrophic-cuts-12793714
583;Farmers paid to protect nature in dramatic overhaul of subsidies scheme;Thursday 26 January 2023 11:30, UK;['victoria seabrook', '@seabrookclimate'];['biodiversity', 'brexit', 'farming', 'climate change'];['dramatic', 'subsidies', 'sustainable', 'paid', 'overhaul', 'land', 'climate', 'scheme', 'farmers', 'environmental', 'work', 'protect', 'nature', 'food', 'farming', 'uk'];"From planting wildflowers and new hedgerows to tackling crop pests without pesticides, farmers will now be paid for 280 different measures to protect Britain's natural world, which provides food, water and habitats.

The long-awaited overhaul of farming subsidies has been hailed as a ""genuine benefit of Brexit"" and broadly welcomed by farmers and green groups.

The voluntary scheme replaces a European Union regime that based payments on the amount of land farmed, meaning sometimes big pay-outs for wealthy land-owners rather than struggling farmers.

The government says the money will help farmers to produce food in a less environmentally damaging way.

It has now opened up £1bn of the £2.4bn annual agriculture budget for nature-friendly farming.

The UK ranks among the worst countries globally for the state of its life-sustaining plants and wildlife, with some 71% of its land taken up by agriculture.

The Environment Secretary Therese Coffey said farmers ""are at the heart of our economy - producing the food on our tables as well as being the custodians of the land it comes from"".

""These two roles go hand-in-hand and we are speeding up the rollout of our farming schemes so that everyone can be financially supported as they protect the planet while producing food more sustainably.""

Environmentalist and columnist George Monbiot called the new system the ""one genuine benefit of Brexit"". If successful, it could become a template for reform across the EU, whose system is a ""disaster"", he wrote on Twitter.

The new measures alone will not be sufficient to ensure the UK meets all its climate and nature targets. Just last week, the environmental watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection, slammed the government for falling short on almost every measure.

The subsidies have been brought forward by a year as part of the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), part of the government's environmental land management (ELM) schemes.

Three more standards that had been planned for 2024 will be introduced a year early, to subsidise the rewilding of grassland and the introduction of bird food, wildflowers and buffer strips of uncultivated land on arable and horticultural land.

Kitty Hamilton, a mixed farmer from east Lincolnshire, said the SFI pilot protected her farm's income while it gradually moved to more sustainable practices.

She said: ""The pilot fits well with our current and planned farming methods, which means it's gently nudging us towards a more regenerative system.

""The fact that we can layer the standards, and use all of the land on the estate, means that we can generate a good income.""

A total of 30 new grants will also be added to the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, which rewards sustainable practices such as managing floodplain meadows, eradicating the use of insecticides, restoring peatland, maintaining drystone walls and preserving cliff habitats.

Government should be 'more radical'

Farmers, who must plan well ahead, have welcomed the ""clarity we have been asking for"".

David Exwood, vice president of the National Farmers' Union, said: ""For farmers and growers making crucial long-term decisions that are essential to running viable and profitable food-producing businesses, it's vital they have the full scheme details as soon as possible and know how the different schemes will work together.""

But the process must work quickly and be available to all types of farm, he cautioned.

However, the Soil Association accused ministers of doing little more than ""tinkering around the edges"" when ""radical changes"" are needed.

""We are facing a climate emergency and ecological collapse... Government must provide the long-term vision to help farmers do more than make small changes,"" Head of Farming Policy Gareth Morgan said.

""They need a package of guidance and incentives that spark a shift to nature-friendly farming across their entire farms.""

Asked by Sky News if it was ""acceptable"" that Nadhim Zahawi paid a penalty to HM Revenue & Customs to settle a tax dispute while in charge of the Treasury, Mr Hammond said: ""My own personal view is that I would not want to accept the office of chancellor if I was at that time involved in a live negotiation of an outstanding tax case with HMRC.""

Mr Zahawi was chancellor in the closing days of the Boris Johnson administration and Mr Hammond said the former prime minister ""has questions to answer"" about his appointment to the cabinet.

""If he was aware of these issues, then I think the question falls at his door,"" he said.

""Why did he appoint somebody to this role who clearly was not in a position to carry out that function?""

Mr Sunak has asked his ethics adviser to investigate whether Mr Zahawi, now the Tory party chairman, breached the ministerial code with the estimated £4.8m HMRC settlement he made while he was chancellor, but it could extend to his previous tax arrangement and whether he lied to the media.

Mr Hammond was chancellor under Theresa May and has previously called Mr Johnson ""not a good prime minister"".

Asked if Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, should take some blame, Lord Hammond said: ""Well, ultimately it's the prime minister who makes the decision who to appoint, who not to appoint to his cabinet, and what offices they should hold.

""It would have been a very different question if Nadhim Zahawi was being appointed to a different office of state.

Andrew Tate told reporters as he left the offices on Wednesday: ""There is no evidence in my file because I've done nothing wrong.""

Diicot spokesperson Ramona Bolla said it was taking time to go through the ""multiple devices"" seized.

587;Baby deaths mystery from 1930s solved by researchers finding 'abnormal' gene shape link to vitamin D side-effects;Thursday 26 January 2023 11:38, UK;[];['health'];['finding', 'link', 'solved', 'gene', 'mutation', 'condition', 'mystery', 'shape', 'deaths', 'genetic', 'patients', 'hcinf1', 'baby', 'researchers', 'sideeffects', 'vitamin', 'd'];"An 80-year-old mystery linked to a wave of baby deaths in the 1930s and 1940s has finally been solved by researchers.

The fatal ingredient was found in household staples - milk, bread, cereal, margarine.

But it was put there to try and make children healthier. In the early 1900s, more than 80% of children were affected by the bone condition rickets, so food was fortified with vitamin D.

The fortification all but eradicated the disease. However, there were fatal side-effects as a result of the measure, as some babies could not metabolise vitamin D properly.

They had a condition which causes a build-up of calcium in the blood, leading to kidney damage and kidney stones, which can be fatal in babies.

Outbreaks of vitamin D intoxication in infants led to fortification bans in many European countries by the 1950s.

Research in 2011 revealed the condition, now known as infantile hypercalcaemia type 1 or HCINF1, is caused by a gene mutation.

But scientists were stumped to find about 10% of patients affected by HCINF1 do not have the genetic mutation.

Many of the baby deaths, and symptoms still experienced by patients today, therefore remained unexplained.

Mystery 'very frightening' for affected mothers

Now, though, researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) have discovered what is going on with these patients - and it's not due to a gene mutation, but their shape.

Lead researcher Dr Darrell Green, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said most patients who are screened and find out they have HCINF1 also have a mutation in the CYP24A1 gene.

Where people don't have that mutation, but still struggle to process vitamin D, they can continue to have ""lifelong problems without a proper diagnosis"", he said.

Issues for patients can include recurrent renal stones and severe pain.

Shelley O'Connor, 34, from Norwich, was only diagnosed with HCINF1 11 years ago when she fell pregnant with her first child at the age of 23.

When she started taking pregnancy supplements to help her baby - which included vitamin D - she began to suffer from intense pain which made her midwives think she was going into labour at just 23 weeks.

""It was very frightening,"" she said. ""I was really scared for the baby, but when I had an MRI, they found out that it was actually a kidney stone caused by taking vitamin D as a pregnancy supplement.""

'Abnormal' gene shape solves puzzle

The UEA team collaborated with colleagues at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, where they worked with 47 patients like Shelley to find out how people could have the condition without the mutation.

They used a combination of next generation genetic sequencing and computational modelling to study blood samples from those 10% of ""puzzling patients"".

Dr Green said: ""A PhD student in my laboratory, Nicole Ball, carried out a more extensive genetic analysis of six patient blood samples and we found that the physical shape of the CYP24A1 gene in these apparent HCINF1 patients is abnormal.

""This tells us that gene shape is important in gene regulation - and that this is the reason why some people lived with HCINF1 but without a definitive diagnosis,"" he added.

Dr Green explained the difference between a genetic mutation in DNA sequencing and the shape of genes, and what this means for patients.

He said: ""On a wider scale relevant to genetics and health, we know that genes must have the correct sequence to produce the correct protein, but in an added layer of complexity, we now know that genes also have to have a correct physical shape.""

The researchers now plan to investigate the role of gene shapes in other disorders such as cancer.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126122247/https://news.sky.com/story/baby-deaths-mystery-from-1930s-solved-by-researchers-finding-abnormal-gene-shape-link-to-vitamin-d-side-effects-12795773

The UK's third-largest grocery chain by market share said its changes were the result of an ""efficiency"" drive but they were met with stinging criticism by the GMB union.

The company has proposed that some overnight restocking shifts at 184 stores are moved to the daytime, putting 211 night shift manager roles at risk.

Asda said the changes would also affect 4,137 hourly-paid workers as their shift patterns would also move to the daytime, resulting in the loss of their night shift pay premium of at least £2.52 per hour.

The plans would also see the opening hours for 23 in-store Post Office branches cut by a quarter and seven in-store pharmacies, which employ 14 pharmacists and 48 other workers, closed down.

The shake-up comes at a time when supermarket profitability has been squeezed by the need to cut prices and compete as discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to eat away at the established grocers' customer bases amid the cost of living crisis.

Value ranges and essentials have formed the main battle ground, with the sector signalling last year that the days when they competed for customers through loss-leading fuel offerings were over.

""We are now entering a period of consultation with our colleagues on these proposals.

""We recognise this will be a difficult time for them and will do all we can to support them through this process.""

The GMB union said its reps would be meeting later on Thursday to discuss its response but hinted that a fight was looming, fearing that more than 4,000 jobs could actually be lost.

National officer Nadine Houghton said: ""The real term impact of this on low-paid retail colleagues is that a night colleague on 30 hours stands to lose in the region of £300 to £400 a month, during a cost-of-living crisis.""

She added: ""For this reason, we expect the proposals to result in significant job losses.

""GMB is also concerned the proposals are quite simply unworkable due to a reduced amount of time being made available to replenish the shop floor.""

The union has been highly critical of Asda's owners, particularly on the issue of pay, in the wake of their debt-fuelled takeover in 2021.

The Times reported last week that Asda could be merged with petrol forecourts business EG Group - also owned by Zuber and Mohsin Issa and London-based private equity group TDR Capital.

Megan Baynes, cost of living reporter says:



This will largely come down to if your bonus is contractual, or discretionary - so you'll first need to have a look in any documents to check the small print around it.

If the bonus is contractual, then by rights you should get it on a particular date and you stand a better chance of arguing you must be paid it.

I also spoke to Marc Jones, a consultant solicitor at EM Law and employment law expert. He told me that if the bonus is discretionary - which a large proportion of them are - it will be difficult to argue that your employer somehow acted unreasonably by not paying it unless you can prove they acted in an arbitrary or capricious way - typically, your colleagues were awarded a bonus and you were not.

Mr Jones also said the length of your notice period could possibly come into play, especially if your contact has since changed, but not been formally updated.

""For example, if the original contractual notice period was one month and then this was extended to three months, but the employment contract was not formally varied to confirm all terms and conditions remain the same, then there is an argument to say the clause in the contract that states a bonus will not be paid while working your notice should be one month rather than three months.

""This could be a factor in deciding when an employee resigns to take up new employment elsewhere.""

Most bonus rules will say you have to be employed by the company at the time it is paid, but does it also have a clause saying the company will not pay the bonus if you are working your notice period?

If it does not, you have a better chance of arguing your employer is acting unreasonably by not paying you.

Mr Jones says: ""If there's nothing in there that mentions about having to be employed when the bonus is paid, or not being on a period of notice, and if the bonus is not paid then we go back to has the employer acted in an arbitrary or capricious way? And if the employer has, then arguably that would be a breach of contract.""

In future, he says it's better to ""be safe than sorry and resign after the bonus has been paid"" - although I appreciate it may be a bit late for this in your case.

If you are still employed and believe you are entitled to the bonus, you can raise a grievance. If that is unsuccessful and your employment ends, you can then bring a claim for breach of contract.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126122247/https://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-two-million-people-told-their-clubcard-vouchers-are-expiring-soon-and-warning-for-households-over-washing-machines-12615118

The German tanks being sent to Ukraine have been described as an ""armoured fist"" and a ""vital battlefield capability"".

The Janes intelligence agency said the Leopard 2 was both ""effective and modern"" and had a ""large international user base"".

That ensures the vehicle is ""readily available in sufficient numbers to make a battlefield difference"".

There is ""easy commonality of spare parts and support, NATO standard ammunition natures (unlike the British Army Challenger) and broad opportunity to conduct training in different countries"", Janes, based in London, added.

It said: ""Main battle tanks remain a vital battlefield capability, the armoured fist of a combined arms assault and a fundamental technology to break out and sustain mobile armoured warfare, as well as dominate territory.""



If warned, however, that the tanks were not a ""panacea by themselves"".

""Even if Ukraine receives significant numbers of Leopards, this will also increase the demand for additional logistic enablers required to operate heavy Western AFVs (armoured fighting vehicles), such as engineering, bridging, mine-clearance and armoured recovery variants as Ukraine’s legacy AFV fleet is based on Soviet-era recovery vehicles designed to support far lighter tanks,"" it added.

Janes said Abrams tanks being sent by the US would impose a ""training burden as there are fewer users in Europe"".



It added, however, that American forces there are ""theoretically well equipped to deliver training"".

It said: ""Abrams was designed to be supported by the US Army’s vast and unrivalled logistics support infrastructure, which may represent the biggest challenge for Ukraine to replicate.

""For example, unlike the diesel powerplants in the Leopard and Challenger, the Abrams is fitted with a power-dense, but unique gas turbine installation, which imposes its own specific support constraints.""

It was announced earlier this week that both the Leopard 2 and the Abrams were being sent to Ukraine.

Puma armoured fighting vehicles raced through the freezing fog of the Altengrabow training base in eastern Germany and fired 30mm live rounds at imaginary enemies. From the back of one of them, the country's new but energetic defence minister looked on.

Boris Pistorius told Sky News there had been no hesitation over sending the Leopard 2 tanks as he arrived. There had been only negotiations with Germany's allies he insisted.

The Leopards will get there by the end of March at the latest, he said. The decision to send Europe's leading battle tank would send a clear message to Russia that Germany will not relent and will stand with Ukraine he added.

Image: German defence minister Boris Pistorius talks to Bundeswehr soldiers during firing practice

The decision marks a sea change in the West's posture in this war. Its policy of arming the Ukrainians with enough to fight but not enough to provoke a Russian escalation has failed. Russia is escalating anyway, mobilising hundreds of thousands of men.

But upping the ante has meant overcoming German hang-ups over its military past. There are profound reservations here about sending battle tanks in a country deeply wary of military aggression for obvious reasons, not least the shame of what German tanks did to Russians in World War Two.

Image: A Leopard tank in 2017

Russian propaganda channels have had a field day in the last 24 hours with absurd claims of a new Nazi ""Fourth Reich"" and demands Germany is attacked and destroyed. For good reason, Germany did not want to take the lead with tanks and openly urged America to go first. Washington was reluctant, too but for different reasons.

Hence the negotiations referred to by Pistorius. Washington and Berlin have now overcome those obstacles, both agreeing to send tanks. It will make a big difference to Ukraine's military potential. But it also sends a clear message to Vladimir Putin. The West will not be held back by German doubts any longer.

The war is escalating again. A year ago, Germany was pilloried for sending only helmets. Now it is sending one of its most lethal weapons and putting on shows of force.

Russia has old-school tanks but they won't be as good

What the Kremlin says publicly and what Mr Putin and his defence minister think privately are two very different things.

Relatively modern, well-equipped Western battle tanks, when they do finally arrive, will give Ukrainian tank battalions better protection and better aim than anything the Russians can field.

The Russians may still have more of their old-school T72 tanks, and more armoured vehicles in general, but they won't be as good.

The Russians have had to watch as Western commitments of kit for Ukraine have grown from helmets, in Germany's case, to battle tanks eleven months on.

They know that there will be a lag in delivery, even if Germany's defence minister said he expected the country's Leopard 2 tanks to be in situ by the end of March at the latest.

Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak were among those fined by the police for taking part, with a total of 126 fixed penalty notices issued, covering at least eight events.

But asked if there was a cap on that price, he said no, and that the figure could increase depending on how long the investigation takes.

""At the moment we have estimated that it would be up to a figure of £200,000, which has been published - £222,000 to be precise,"" said Mr Chisholm.

The act, signed into law in August last year, has absolutely nothing to do with tackling the cost of living crisis.

Rather, it is a gigantic piece of pump-priming, a $369bn package dangling generous subsidies and incentives to stimulate the take-up and roll-out of green energy across the US.

It is specifically aimed at encouraging more manufacturing of electric vehicles, and the batteries that power them, in the United States.

Businesses, particularly those involved in making things essential for the energy transition such as wind turbines and solar panels, will obviously benefit.

So, too, will households. Among the act's provisions are lobs to individual households, with tax credits worth up to $7,500 for those who buy new electric vehicles, while those buying EVs that are at least two years old could qualify for credits worth up to $4,000.

To put the size of those bungs in context, the median annual salary for an American worker last year was $54,132. The credits, naturally, will go only to those households buying EVs built in the US.

Image: The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act has been widely criticised abroad

Great news, then, for US households and businesses.

The EU, however, is horrified. It believes the act breaks World Trade Organisation rules that forbid countries like the US from discriminating against imported goods and has warned it could retaliate.

Also unhappy are Canada, which has been jogged into rolling out more green subsidies of its own, while Japan and South Korea have also been aggrieved.

The act, then, threatens to spark a trade war. Such risks were common during the presidency of Donald Trump, who frequently threatened the EU with tariffs, for example in retaliation for penalties on the US tech giants.

Mr Trump also engaged in tit-for-tat trade disputes with China. Mr Biden's approach to both China and trade disputes more broadly appears very little different from that of his predecessor.

It all presents a dilemma for the EU. Does it either seek to retaliate under WTO rules or does it respond with similar subsidies of its own, as has been urged by Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister?

Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition chief, indicated in a speech on Wednesday in Brussels that she favours a mix of measures. Describing the US measures as ""toxic"", she said the EU's response would be ""firm, but of course it will remain proportionate."" At the same time, though, she has called for ""an EU green deal industrial plan"".

Note that very precise wording. It goes to the heart of the EU's problem.

Countries like France and Germany, with big manufacturing bases to support, would be more than happy to subsidise such activities and, due to the size of their economies and the financial firepower at their disposal, would have little difficulty in doing so. Other EU member states, though, might struggle.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 6:02 UK car industry seeks support amid 'protectionist' threat

As Ms Vestager put it in her speech on Wednesday: ""The reality in the EU today is that not all countries have the same capacity to spend. This means that a subsidy race between the member states will always be inherently unfair.""

She said that, while Brussels might seek to offer tax breaks to support new investments in the green economy, this would have to be done in a way that did not pit member states against each other or threaten the integrity of the EU's single market - integrity which, as the UK has discovered to its cost with the Northern Ireland Protocol, the bloc will go to great lengths to defend.

Ms Vestager added: ""We will not sacrifice the single market. Because a well-functioning single market is part of the engine that will make this work.""

In other words, stand by for a classic dose of EU fudge, aimed at supporting the green economy in the way Mr Biden aims to in the US but that will, in the process, probably involve individual protection or support for favoured groups. An industrial equivalent, if you like, of singling out French cheese producers or Italian olive farmers for special help.

Caught between these two blocs, at risk of being tossed like a cork on the high seas, is post-Brexit Britain.

Now outside the single market, there is little in principle to stop the UK offering big subsidies to manufacturers supporting the green transition. But British companies might also be at risk of being caught in the cross-fire should the EU choose to respond to Mr Biden's act by rolling out subsidies for its manufacturers.

And, as business leaders have been stressing this week, there is not a moment to lose.

As Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI, noted in a well-received speech: ""The UK is falling behind rapidly - to the Americans and the Europeans, who are outspending and outsmarting us. We're behind the Germans on heat-pumps, insulation and building retrofits, the French on EV charging infrastructure, and the US on operational carbon capture and storage projects - despite the UK's North Sea advantage. We're lagging all three on hydrogen funding.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:58 CBI makes case for investment aid

""We believe the UK could lead the world on green growth as we did in setting net zero targets. But we're on the verge of being relegated from the Champions League by the Americans and the Europeans: both in an arms race to win global market share.

""Not only are they spending money, they're abandoning regulatory barriers including state aid to win the prize. That's a lesson for us on what it means to go big.""

Doing nothing is not an option, either, as Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, has made clear.

Releasing data that showed UK car production last year fell to its lowest level since 1956, the year of the Suez Crisis, Mr Hawes said the UK government has ""got to do something"" in response to Mr Biden's act and the potential EU response.

He added: ""You can't just accept this laissez faire approach to investment, it's not a level playing field.""

The problem is that, with the public finances shattered by the pandemic and now under strain due to both surging debt servicing costs and the cost of subsidising energy bills, the UK is in no position to throw as much money at green subsidies as either the US or the EU.

All is not lost, though. Mr Danker believes it is possible to ""make smart fiscal choices rather than believing we can outspend the competition"", such as supporting immature technologies, while engaging in long overdue reform of the UK's sclerotic, anti-growth planning rules.

The question, as he noted, is whether the political willpower exists to do this.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126143236/http://news.sky.com/story/uk-must-respond-as-prospect-of-transatlantic-trade-war-looms-large-12795945

Saffron Cordery, the interim chief executive at NHS Providers, the membership organisation for NHS trusts in England, praised the ""remarkable progress"" made in reducing handover delays, but warned there is still ""relentless"" pressure on urgent and emergency care services.

""As trust leaders prepare for the biggest NHS staff walkout in less than two weeks, they are having to grapple with unsafe levels of bed occupancy, with 93.8% of general and acute ward beds taken up each day last week,"" she said.

""Patients are staying longer in hospital than they were this time last year, often because their illnesses are more serious, while delayed discharge remains very high. This is partly due to the lack of investment in capacity in social care and community services.

""All of these stresses are impacting care right through the system, including ambulances, hospital A&Es;, mental health and community services.""

There were also fewer NHS staff absences in the week to 22 January than any other this winter.

49,260 staff were absent each day on average, compared with more than 60,000 through the middle of December and 52,960 last week.

4,144 (8.4%) were because of COVID - the lowest it's been this winter.

It was 8,029 (12.7%) in the week to Christmas Day (the highest it's been this year), and 5,077 (9.6%) last week.

Professor Julian Redhead, NHS England national clinical director for urgent and emergency care, said: ""These new figures show that while there have been improvements in ambulance handovers and fewer flu patients in hospital, the NHS remains under significant pressure.

""Last week saw more people being taken to A&E; by ambulance, bed occupancy is still constrained, and illnesses like flu and norovirus are still a very real concern.

""The NHS has done extensive preparation for this winter, including rolling out extra beds, a national falls services and nationwide 24/7 control centres to track and manage demand, and NHS staff are working flat-out to continue to provide the best care for our patients in the face of ongoing pressures.""

Home Secretary Suella Braverman has announced she will not introduce a migrants' commissioner, going against the recommendation of the review into the Windrush scandal.

Ms Braverman made the announcement in a written statement to the Commons.

The Windrush scandal came to a head in 2018 when British citizens, many of whom were from the Caribbean, were detained, deported or threatened with deportation despite having the right to live in the UK.

A report into the scandal has since made 30 recommendations - all of which ex-home secretary Priti Patel accepted.

According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) there were 199,021 sex crimes logged by forces up to September 2022, an increase of 22%, in comparison to March 2020 (163,244).

Of these, 35% (70,633) were rapes - a 20% increase from the 59,104 recorded in the year prior to the pandemic.

Diana Fawcett, chief executive of charity Victim Support, said the system is in ""crisis"" as a rise in recorded sexual offences comes as cases seeking justice plummet to an ""abysmal new low"".

""Charges for rape and sexual offences have been falling sharply for the past six years,"" she said. ""We are on a path to destroying victims' faith in the criminal justice system altogether.""

Figures also showed that the overall number of crimes recorded by England and Wales police forces exceeded pre-pandemic levels to reach 6.6 million.

But the ONS urged that the data be interpreted with ""caution"" as a ""number of factors"" could be responsible for the increase. Including improvements in how police record crime as well as high-profile cases and campaigns encouraging victims to step forward.

It added that the rise in overall crime was ""largely driven by increases in the offence categories, which are most subject to changes in reporting and recording practices"", meaning the figures ""may not reflect a genuine increase in crime"".

Meghan Elkin from the ONS, said that police-recorded crime figures are a ""better indicator of police activity"", rather than providing a reliable insight into crime trends.

While the figures are the highest recorded for England and Wales annually, the crime survey shows no significant change in prevalence.

Andrew Bridgen was suspended from the Conservative Party earlier this month after tweeting: ""As one consultant cardiologist said to me, this is the biggest crime against humanity since the Holocaust.""

Mr Hancock, the former health secretary, said in the House of Commons that the statement was a ""disgusting. antisemitic, anti-vax conspiracy"".

He later echoed the statement on Twitter, which is not covered by parliamentary privilege.

Mr Bridgen warned Mr Hancock to delete the tweet, posting on 13 January: ""He has still not removed his defamatory tweet falsely alleging that I am antisemitic. I will allow Matt three days to apologise publicly for calling me an antisemite and racist or he will be contacted by my legal team.""

The MP for North West Leicestershire confirmed on Thursday that he has now sent Mr Hancock a legal letter before action ""regarding defamation"", with the Telegraph reporting Mr Bridgen is seeking £100,000 from Mr Hancock.

""Rather than wasting his time and money on an absurd libel case he will undoubtedly lose, let's hope Bridgen does the right thing and apologises for the hurt he's caused and keeps his offensive view to himself in future.""

The Holocaust is the name given to the systematic murder of six million Jewish people by the Nazi Germany regime and their allies during the Second World War.

Martin Stern, who survived the concentration camps, accused Mr Bridgen of ""mind-boggling ignorance"" while several MPs and charities also condemned the remarks.

Mr Bridgen defended his comments, insisting they were in ""no way antisemitic"" and actually ""alluded to the Holocaust being the most heinous crime against humanity in living memory"".

""Of course, if anyone is genuinely offended by my use of such imagery, then I apologise for any offence caused,"" he added.

""I wholeheartedly refute any suggestion that I am racist and currently I am speaking to a legal team who will commence action against those who have led the call suggesting that I am.""

For Tony Preston, the long waiting times he has faced for physio is making him consider private health care.

He has had a number of surgeries since 2003, including three new hips, an ankle fused and tendons fixed in his shoulder.

He says in that time, he never waited longer than a month to be seen and never longer than three months for surgery.

However, he suffered an injury to his Achilles tendon in October that has left him ""struggling to walk"".

He was offered around two months later in December, but it was moved to February and he is now unsure if that appointment will go ahead.

""I've paid into my taxes for 57 years, I need to be active for my own sanity, and it's doing me no good at home. I'm so disappointed with the waiting list now, it is absolutely terrible,"" Mr Preston says.

""I'm seriously thinking of going private now. It's not in my principles, but I'm struggling to walk, and I just can't put up with this any longer,"" he adds.

Health policy analyst Roy Lilley replies that the ""production line is bunged up"" and the NHS is in the middle of ""one of the most horrendous"" flue seasons.

On top of that, the NHS has been plagued by strikes and COVID is continuing to be a struggle.

The Jewish author and comedian also said he considers the musician to be racist.

West is currently suspended from Twitter for tweeting an image of a swastika hours after praising Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.

The musician, 45, posted the grossly offensive image only two weeks after being allowed back on the site following a previous ban.

Baddiel said he understood why Twitter owner Elon Musk might consider another reprieve for the rapper.

""Kanye being let back onto that platform seems to be part of Elon Musk trying to make (it) less dominated by the progressive left,"" Baddiel told the Beth Rigby Interviews programme.

""I'm not bothered about those arguments. I'm bothered about what is dangerous for Jews. What is dangerous for my children.

""I do think it's dangerous. I think it's actively dangerous.""

Regarding West's motivation, Baddiel said antisemitism is ""often seen by people as punching up"".

He continued: ""So they don't see it as racism, because what they see is that Jews are powerful.

""So Kanye will say things like, Jews are in control of the music business, I'm finally throwing off the shackles of how Jews won't let me speak about this, because they're in control.""

West has previously accused record producer Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of being controlled by ""the Jewish people"" in a post on Instagram.

Baddiel went on: ""It comes from a sense of, this is a rebel yell against a race that is controlling us, and the problem with that is it doesn't sound like a far-right person saying 'look at these scum, I'm just going to kill them'.

""It sounds like someone fighting the good fight. And that is actually what Hitler, who Kanye has said he's an admirer of, that is also how Hitler sounded to some people.""

In an interview with the conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, West said: ""I like Hitler.""

West retains the ability to influence people, Baddiel said. ""Kanye, because he's a brilliant hip hop artist, has got a really powerful voice,"" he pointed out.

Asked whether West is racist, Baddiel said: ""I think what he said is antisemitic. And I think antisemitism is racism. Yes.""

Baddiel also discussed his recent apology to the ex-footballer Jason Lee, for the way he portrayed him in sketches in his 1990s television series Fantasy Football League.

""As I became more aware of racism directed against me, as well as being hurt or upset by that, or thinking this is weird, this clearly really racist thing - that I am guilty of the same thing,"" he said.

""And that brought it home to me over time, over much too much time, that I should apologise to Jason Lee.

""When I (made a) documentary, I thought I should go and film a face-to-face apology. And thankfully Jason was up for doing that, and it was really difficult. He didn't in any way let me off.""

Baddiel said he ""felt terrible"", ""totally felt terrible"".

Another positive NHS story being shared now, with Carole from Sheffield saying her dad was picked up by an ambulance and treated within five and a half hours.

Her 90-year-old father fell on the ice and broke his leg last week.

She says the ambulance was called at around 9:45am and by 2:30pm she had already received a call to say her dad was comfortable and being treated for his pain.

""All of his treatment has been absolutely brilliant, it has all gone really swimmingly and all the nurses have been fabulous.

Health policy analyst Roy Lilley adds this is ""how it is supposed to be done"", but there are a lot of factors to consider as to why this is the case, including the area and the staffing levels.

Disgruntled passengers took to social media to share concern for ""dangerous"" overcrowding, with hundreds of people queuing to get on to platforms.

Southeastern, which operates trains from the station, said passengers were delayed due to a trespasser at Hither Green, south east London, but many blamed the network's new slimmed-down timetable.

Implemented on December 11, the ""simplified"" timetable involves fewer peak-time trains and a cut in services, and has caused serious backlash.

One passenger, Suzanne Whitlock, wrote: ""100s of passengers in a crush at London Bridge due to the changes you introduced - with no consultation - in December.

""It's not just doubled commutes, it's dangerous. Every night is like this, trapped on packed trains, escalators and platforms. Do something.""

The comments, in an exclusive interview with Sky News's Kay Burley, reinforce his government's position on the subject of peace talks - they cannot happen while Mr Putin remains president.

It is a strongly-held sentiment fuelled by outrage and disgust at the horror, pain and death that Russian forces have inflicted on Ukraine over the past 11 months of all-out war at the behest of their commander in chief.

However, some Western diplomats privately wonder whether continuing to maintain such a red line is sensible if pressure mounts for dialogue to end the war and Mr Putin, 70, stays in power.

They say it might instead be helpful if the Ukrainians were to lift this condition to make dialogue more likely at a point when Kyiv is in a relative position of strength, having launched successful counter-offensives to recapture territory in the northeast and south of the country, and with Western allies still strongly backing the war with heavy weapons, including tanks.

The worry among these diplomats is that the longer the war drags on, the greater the risk that the balance of power might shift more towards the Russian side, potentially weakening Ukraine's hand further.

But Mr Zelenskyy, 45, made clear that he was not in the mood to compromise.

Asked whether he would consider peace talks with Russia, the president said: ""So far there are no peace talks with Russia because… we don't know who we should negotiate with, and about what.

""What kind of peace talks? At present, these are just criminals who came here and were killing and raping. That's what they have been doing.""

He said any conversation could only happen under new leadership and once Russian forces have withdrawn from all Ukrainian territory.

""We hope that once Russia pulls its troops back to their territory, they will admit their big mistakes, and there will be a new government in the Russian Federation,"" the president said.

""We are neighbours. It will be only then that we will be resolving this situation. Then, probably, talks will be possible.""

But what if he were in a room alone with Mr Putin? What would Mr Zelenskyy say?

His answer, given in English, was unwavering: ""It is not interesting for me. Not interesting to meet, not interesting to speak… Who is he now? After full-scale invasion, for me he is nobody, nobody. No decisions with him, not interesting.""

Israeli military say they killed three members of the Islamic Jihad militant organisation, suspected of planning ""multiple major terror attacks"" as well as other gunmen in the camp.

An elderly woman was also reported to have been killed and Palestinian officials have accused Israeli forces of using tear gas inside a children's ward.

The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not commented on those claims but said it is investigating the death of the woman. No IDF casualties were reported.

""During the operation to apprehend the terrorists, additional armed suspects opened fire toward the security forces, who responded with live fire,"" the IDF said.

Mahmoud Abbas, the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, called for three days of mourning to mark the deaths.

Tor Wennesland, the UN Special Coordinator in Jerusalem, said he was ""deeply alarmed and saddened by the continuing cycle of violence"". He urged both sides to ""reduce tensions immediately"".

Israeli security forces are said to be on alert for a response from the Gaza Strip after the raid in Jenin on Thursday morning.

Jenin has been a regular flashpoint during months of increasing violence in The West Bank. 29 Palestinians have been killed this month alone, including five children.

The new Israeli government, only a few weeks old, is one of the most right-wing in the country's history and has already hardened policies towards Palestinians, including the withdrawal of some tax revenues and a pledge to increase settlement building in the occupied territories.

617;NHS crisis: How is the health service in your local area performing this winter?;Thursday 26 January 2023 15:43, UK;[];['data and forensics'];['service', 'area', 'local', 'data', 'bed', 'hours', 'waiting', 'minutes', '12', 'patients', 'winter', 'care', 'times', 'health', 'crisis', 'performing', 'nhs'];"New data shows that GP waiting times fell in December for the second consecutive month, with the share of people managing to secure an urgent appointment on the same day rising from 69% to 74%.

That's precious good news for the NHS, which is currently enduring its most difficult winter on record. The health service only began publishing data on GP appointments in September, so it's not possible to say how the current waiting times compare to previous winters.

Any improvement, however, will ease the burden on patients currently facing record waiting times elsewhere in the health service.

You can see how your health service is performing using the tool below.

The national picture

After securing a referral from their GP, many patients in England are being left waiting months to see a consultant.

As of November, 40% of patients seeking a diagnostic test were being forced to wait more than four weeks, with 13% waiting for over 12 weeks. Such long waits were practically unheard of before the COVID pandemic.

Diagnostic waiting times are longest in Lincolnshire, where nearly two in five patients (37%) wait more than 12 weeks for a test in November. That includes 81% who waited more than 12 weeks for a bone density scan, and 78% who waited over 12 weeks for an echocardiogram.

It is in emergency departments, however, that the crisis in the NHS is most visible.

Most critical incidents

Ambulances are supposed to reach the most critical incidents, which require immediate intervention or resuscitation, within seven minutes. That target has not been met since April 2021.

In December, it took ambulances in England an average of 11 minutes to reach such calls - a minute longer than the previous record, set in October.

Response times were slowest in the South West, where ambulances took 13 minutes on average to reach such cases, nearly twice the target.

Less urgent situations

Waiting times are even worse for slightly less urgent, but still life-threatening, situations such as heart attacks and strokes.

Ambulances are supposed to reach such calls within 18 minutes. As of December the average response time stood at 93 minutes, with 10% of callers waiting more than three hours and 42 minutes to be picked up.

In the South West, the average waiting time for such cases stood two hours and 39 minutes, with 10% of callers waiting over six hours and 39 minutes to be seen.

A spokesperson for the South Western Ambulance Service told Sky News that health and social care services are ""under enormous pressure"".

""Our ambulance clinicians strive every day to deliver their best care for patients, but our performance has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, partly due to handover delays at emergency departments,"" the spokesperson said.

'Handover times over three hours'

Ambulances in England spent 143,000 hours waiting outside hospitals in November, with 11,391 handovers taking more than three hours, according to data from the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives.

Those delays have improved in recent weeks, but remain at record levels for this time of year. One in five ambulance handovers (20.2%) took more than 30 minutes during the week to 22 January, compared to 18.3% during the same week in 2022 and 11.7% in 2020.

Lengthy handover delays are the result of backlogs within emergency departments themselves.

The time it takes to get through England's Type 1 A&E; departments, which treat the most severe cases, has never been longer.

The chart below shows the share of A&E; attendances lasting more than four hours each month. Every month in 2022 saw a new record broken, with more than half of attendances taking over four hours for the first time ever in December.

Other nations in the UK collect data for all A&E; departments together, including minor injury units and specialist services. In Scotland's Forth Valley, 62% of attendances lasted more than four hours - twice the British average.

That data includes people who attended A&E; but didn't need to be admitted. For those who do need a bed, the waits are far longer.

One in every three people admitted to England's A&E; departments this December (33%) had to wait at least four hours between the point at which a clinician decided to admit them, and the point at which they actually got to a bed, with 11% waiting for over 12 hours.

In 2015, by comparison, just 8% of patients endured ""trolley waits"" of more than four hours, with fewer than 0.01% waiting more than 12 hours.

As of December, three of the five NHS trusts with the longest trolley waits were in London, with Croydon and North Middlesex trusts both seeing more than a third of patients wait over 12 hours. By far the longest waiting times, however, were in East Cheshire NHS Trust, where more than half of people admitted (52%) waited more than 12 hours for a bed.

Bed shortages

The government has previously identified bed shortages as a key cause of long A&E; waiting times. The UK has long been unusual by international standards in how full its hospitals are, but in recent years the situation has become critical.

Every winter, the share of beds occupied has been rising: from 87% in 2020, to 90% in 2021, to 94% in 2022.

According to the National Audit Office, bed occupancy above 85% ""can lead to regular bed shortages, periodic bed crises and increased numbers of hospital-acquired infections"".

As of December, 92% of trusts had occupancy rates above this threshold - up from 64% in December 2020.

That includes the George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust in Nuneaton, which has been at 100% occupancy for general and acute beds since April. The trust's chief operating officer told Sky News that demand had been ""exceptionally high"" in recent months.

For other trusts, bed shortages are concentrated in particular types of care. Manchester University hospitals have been at full capacity for paediatric critical care since October, while neonatal critical care beds have been fully occupied in Oxford University hospitals for more than a year.

The total number of NHS beds has halved since 1987, as successive governments sought to cut costs and improve outcomes by moving certain types of care out of hospitals and into the community.

That strategy has been undermined in recent years by large cuts to local authority budgets. Over the past decade, the number of care home beds per person aged over 75 has fallen by 17%, according to government data.

With analysis from the King's Fund and the Health Foundation, Sky News is launching a new year-long project to examine the NHS at 75, the problems it faces and the potential solutions.

Those at the Windsor Foodshare were only given an hour's warning before the royal couple arrived on Thursday morning, where they helped pack deliveries and offered workers an unexpected glimpse into their married life.

Chief executive Sarah Kember greeted the pair as they arrived at the Dedworth Green Baptist Church, later speaking to them about the work of the food bank with the scheme's founder Sarah Howard and chairman of Windsor Christian Action Geoff Hudson.

Kate asked how many food banks were in the area during the brief meeting, as well as enquiring about whether the produce is fresh, and if some people struggle with the stigma sometimes associated with asking for help.

William went on to ask how to set up a food bank.

The couple then went on a tour of the area, and helped a team to prepare nearly 100 food vouchers, before going on to pack deliveries and help check the food was in date.

'I asked William if he did the shopping normally...'

William joked with the volunteers, at one point saying they should stop chatting and pick up the pace.

He received praise from those at the food bank for his neat packing.

Those there say they were ""shocked"" to discover they would be meeting the heir to the throne, but later said the pair put them at ease with their ""natural"" and ""down to earth"" manner.

The prince also let slip how shopping arrangements work for the royal couple.

Volunteer Linda, 72, said: ""It was fabulous. We didn't know until we got here, we had no idea.

""I asked William if he did the shopping normally, and he said 'sometimes, but usually Kate does it'.

""They were very human and down to earth, very nice, asked lots of questions and were very interested. It is definitely something I will remember.""

Emma Pilbrow added: ""They were very natural and down to earth. I felt they wanted to be here, and they showed a lot of interest.

""They asked where the food comes from and what happens to any vegetables that were left over. I also joked with them about knobbly vegetables.""

Maria Branyas Morera was born in San Francisco on 4 March 1907 - seven years before the start of World War One.

In just over a month, she will be 116.

Her parents decided to return to Spain in 1915 to settle in Catalonia but her father died from pulmonary tuberculosis towards the end of the voyage.

Ms Morera, whose Twitter biography says she is ""very old but not an idiot"", has lived in the region ever since.

She has three children, 11 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.

In 2020, she fought off COVID within a few days after becoming infected a few weeks after celebrating her 113th birthday.

Her predecessor as the world's previous oldest person, French nun Sister Andre, died at the age of 118 last week.

Ms Morera has lived in the same nursing home - Residència Santa María del Tura - for the last 22 years.

""She is in good health and continues to be surprised and grateful for the attention that this anniversary has generated,"" the home said in a statement.

""To celebrate this very special event we will have a small celebration behind closed doors in the residence in the coming days.""

With the help of her daughter, Ms Morera shares advice on Twitter, attributing her longevity to ""order, tranquillity, good connection with family and friends, contact with nature, emotional stability, no worries, no regrets, lots of positivity, and staying away from toxic people"".

She added: ""I think longevity is also about being lucky. Luck and good genetics.""

Ms Morera said she had ""very bad memories"" of the Spanish Civil War, which broke out in 1936 when she was 29.

She married her husband, a Catalan doctor called Joan Moret, in 1931.

After waiting hours for the priest, the couple were told he had died.

""There was no phone,"" she said on Twitter. ""A car had to go down to Girona to look for an available chaplain.

""At that time, in the entire province of Girona, there must have been around 50 cars.""

On the first day of 2023, she tweeted: ""Life is not eternal for anyone... At my age, a new year is a gift, a humble celebration, a new adventure, a beautiful journey, a moment of happiness.

Ms Braverman has confirmed she will not be implementing all of the accepted recommendations from a review into how the scandal unfolded, including establishing a migrant's commissioner.

The cabinet minister has also decided not to increase the powers of the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration (ICIBI) or to hold reconciliation events with the Windrush community - in a move branded ""yet another betrayal"".

Politics live: Sunak wants Nadhim Zahawi probe finished 'as quickly as possible'

The Windrush scandal erupted in 2018 when British citizens, mostly from the Caribbean, were wrongly detained, deported or threatened with deportation, despite having the right to live in the UK.

Many lost homes and jobs, and were denied access to healthcare and benefits.

A report into the scandal has since made 30 recommendations - all of which ex-home secretary Priti Patel accepted.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:11 This year is the 75th anniversary of HMT Empire Windrush arriving in the UK, the symbolic start of mass post-war immigration.

Patrick Vernon, who is organising this year's 75th-anniversary celebrations of the Windrush generation's arrival in Britain, said: ""For the Home Secretary to be backsliding on government commitments to set right the injustices of the Windrush scandal - particularly in this anniversary year - is a slap in the face for those communities.""

The Windrush generation is named after the ship that brought hundreds of people from the Caribbean to the UK to help rebuild it after the Second World War, with the first one arriving in 1948.

The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, tweeted: ""Black Britons detained and deported by their own government are once again being spat on by the Conservative government.

""Suella Braverman's animosity towards our shared multicultural future is trauma-inducing.

""Our country's brave Windrush victims denied justice yet again.""

Wendy Williams, the solicitor who carried out the Windrush Lessons Learned Review, said she was ""disappointed"" Ms Braverman had reversed her predecessor's promise, calling the scrapped recommendations ""crucial external scrutiny measures"".

""I believe they will raise the confidence of the Windrush community, but also help the department succeed as it works to protect the wider public, of whom the Windrush generation is such an important part,"" she said.

In a progress review published last year, Ms Williams warned that not having a commissioner would mean the department ""risks undermining its stated commitment to transparency and effective policymaking, as well as the efforts to rebuild its reputation"".

But Ms Braverman said in a Commons statement on Thursday that ""external bodies are not the only source of scrutiny"" and that she would instead look to ""shift culture and subject ourselves to scrutiny"".

On reconciliation events - proposed meetings between ministers, Home Office staff and those targeted during the scandal - Ms Braverman said she had been ""persuaded that there are more effective ways of engaging with those impacted"".

Ms Cooper pointed to failures to pay compensation ""to those who were so badly wronged"", adding: ""Four years after Wendy Williams' review, just eight of its recommendations have been fully implemented and now some have been dropped altogether, including important safeguards to strengthen the borders inspectorate.

Among others who told their stories during the Sky News phone-in were Victoria, who told how her father died earlier this month after COVID and pneumonia in hospital. He had been waiting five months to be discharged.

Another woman who called in said she had been on a waiting list for an appointment for three years.

""I'm losing the will to live,"" she told Sky News' Sarah-Jane Mee, adding: ""I don't know what to do, and what worries me is that the situation for me and others could get worse.""

Not all callers had negative experiences. One person rang in to say she had been happy with her treatment when she needed major surgery - but she did blame the government for failing to fund the health service, saying ""the nurses worked their guts out"".

Carole, from Sheffield, also shared a positive story about how her father fell on ice last week and broke his leg. The 90-year-old was picked up by an ambulance and treated in five-and-a-half hours.

""All of his treatment has been absolutely brilliant, it has all gone really swimmingly and all the nurses have been fabulous,"" she added.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126174735/http://news.sky.com/story/sir-rod-stewart-calls-in-to-sky-news-to-donate-for-medical-scans-after-hearing-nhs-crisis-stories-and-says-change-the-bloody-government-12796105
629;NHS crisis: How is the health service in your local area performing this winter?;Thursday 26 January 2023 15:43, UK;[];['data and forensics'];['service', 'area', 'local', 'data', 'bed', 'hours', 'waiting', 'minutes', '12', 'patients', 'winter', 'care', 'times', 'health', 'crisis', 'performing', 'nhs'];"New data shows that GP waiting times fell in December for the second consecutive month, with the share of people managing to secure an urgent appointment on the same day rising from 69% to 74%.

That's precious good news for the NHS, which is currently enduring its most difficult winter on record. The health service only began publishing data on GP appointments in September, so it's not possible to say how the current waiting times compare to previous winters.

Any improvement, however, will ease the burden on patients currently facing record waiting times elsewhere in the health service.

You can see how your health service is performing using the tool below.

The national picture

After securing a referral from their GP, many patients in England are being left waiting months to see a consultant.

As of November, 40% of patients seeking a diagnostic test were being forced to wait more than four weeks, with 13% waiting for over 12 weeks. Such long waits were practically unheard of before the COVID pandemic.

Diagnostic waiting times are longest in Lincolnshire, where nearly two in five patients (37%) wait more than 12 weeks for a test in November. That includes 81% who waited more than 12 weeks for a bone density scan, and 78% who waited over 12 weeks for an echocardiogram.

It is in emergency departments, however, that the crisis in the NHS is most visible.

Most critical incidents

Ambulances are supposed to reach the most critical incidents, which require immediate intervention or resuscitation, within seven minutes. That target has not been met since April 2021.

In December, it took ambulances in England an average of 11 minutes to reach such calls - a minute longer than the previous record, set in October.

Response times were slowest in the South West, where ambulances took 13 minutes on average to reach such cases, nearly twice the target.

Less urgent situations

Waiting times are even worse for slightly less urgent, but still life-threatening, situations such as heart attacks and strokes.

Ambulances are supposed to reach such calls within 18 minutes. As of December the average response time stood at 93 minutes, with 10% of callers waiting more than three hours and 42 minutes to be picked up.

In the South West, the average waiting time for such cases stood two hours and 39 minutes, with 10% of callers waiting over six hours and 39 minutes to be seen.

A spokesperson for the South Western Ambulance Service told Sky News that health and social care services are ""under enormous pressure"".

""Our ambulance clinicians strive every day to deliver their best care for patients, but our performance has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, partly due to handover delays at emergency departments,"" the spokesperson said.

'Handover times over three hours'

Ambulances in England spent 143,000 hours waiting outside hospitals in November, with 11,391 handovers taking more than three hours, according to data from the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives.

Those delays have improved in recent weeks, but remain at record levels for this time of year. One in five ambulance handovers (20.2%) took more than 30 minutes during the week to 22 January, compared to 18.3% during the same week in 2022 and 11.7% in 2020.

Lengthy handover delays are the result of backlogs within emergency departments themselves.

The time it takes to get through England's Type 1 A&E; departments, which treat the most severe cases, has never been longer.

The chart below shows the share of A&E; attendances lasting more than four hours each month. Every month in 2022 saw a new record broken, with more than half of attendances taking over four hours for the first time ever in December.

Other nations in the UK collect data for all A&E; departments together, including minor injury units and specialist services. In Scotland's Forth Valley, 62% of attendances lasted more than four hours - twice the British average.

That data includes people who attended A&E; but didn't need to be admitted. For those who do need a bed, the waits are far longer.

One in every three people admitted to England's A&E; departments this December (33%) had to wait at least four hours between the point at which a clinician decided to admit them, and the point at which they actually got to a bed, with 11% waiting for over 12 hours.

In 2015, by comparison, just 8% of patients endured ""trolley waits"" of more than four hours, with fewer than 0.01% waiting more than 12 hours.

As of December, three of the five NHS trusts with the longest trolley waits were in London, with Croydon and North Middlesex trusts both seeing more than a third of patients wait over 12 hours. By far the longest waiting times, however, were in East Cheshire NHS Trust, where more than half of people admitted (52%) waited more than 12 hours for a bed.

Bed shortages

The government has previously identified bed shortages as a key cause of long A&E; waiting times. The UK has long been unusual by international standards in how full its hospitals are, but in recent years the situation has become critical.

Every winter, the share of beds occupied has been rising: from 87% in 2020, to 90% in 2021, to 94% in 2022.

According to the National Audit Office, bed occupancy above 85% ""can lead to regular bed shortages, periodic bed crises and increased numbers of hospital-acquired infections"".

As of December, 92% of trusts had occupancy rates above this threshold - up from 64% in December 2020.

That includes the George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust in Nuneaton, which has been at 100% occupancy for general and acute beds since April. The trust's chief operating officer told Sky News that demand had been ""exceptionally high"" in recent months.

For other trusts, bed shortages are concentrated in particular types of care. Manchester University hospitals have been at full capacity for paediatric critical care since October, while neonatal critical care beds have been fully occupied in Oxford University hospitals for more than a year.

The total number of NHS beds has halved since 1987, as successive governments sought to cut costs and improve outcomes by moving certain types of care out of hospitals and into the community.

That strategy has been undermined in recent years by large cuts to local authority budgets. Over the past decade, the number of care home beds per person aged over 75 has fallen by 17%, according to government data.

With analysis from the King's Fund and the Health Foundation, Sky News is launching a new year-long project to examine the NHS at 75, the problems it faces and the potential solutions.

Sarah Jackson, 24, describes herself as an ocean advocate and wants to use her voice for good as she windsurfs her way to becoming a world champion in the sport.

Aside from racking up world championship silver medals and being ranked second in the world in her slalom discipline, Ms Jackson is an athlete on an ethical mission: to wage the war against single-use plastics and sewage pollution destroying the world's oceans.

But she has found herself leaving her home county of Cheshire to relocate to the Spanish Canary island of Tenerife over the pollution problem at Hayling Island, a windsurfing hotspot in Hampshire.

Travel restrictions during the COVID pandemic forced her to train in the UK, but she soon discovered that she was often faced with sewage pollution due to the releasing of a deluge of raw sewage into the sea, which is often made worse during periods of heavy rainfall.

Ms Jackson, from Knutsford, said: ""This being Britain, where rainfall is very high. And because I have to train in all weathers, there were some days when I was basically surfing in a sewer.

""That's not just unpleasant, it's actually health threatening - but it's opened my eyes to the problem of pollution in our waterways - not just from sewage but from chemicals and plastics, too.""

She has now become an ocean ambassador for the Marine Conservation Society, a UK-based charity that calls for initiatives to protect UK and global waters from overfishing, as well as protecting and restoring marine life and limiting pollutants - such as sewage and plastics.

""Because I spend so much time on the water - not just in the UK but around the world - I see at very close quarters the damage the human race is inflicting on the marine environment,"" Ms Jackson said, ""and that's why I'm supporting the Marine Conservation Society.""

633;Will the curse of the cabinet awayday spark doom for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak?;Thursday 26 January 2023 18:00, UK;['jon craig', '@joncraig'];['nadhim zahawi', 'rishi sunak'];['prime', 'spark', 'mr', 'curse', 'minister', 'johnson', 'sunak', 'blair', 'theresa', 'held', 'cabinet', 'ministers', 'doom', 'awayday', 'rishi'];"Cabinet awaydays seem like a good idea at the time, but almost invariably end badly.

From Blair to Sunak, Brown to BoJo, they've been held at least annually by just about every prime minister in modern times.

The aim: a brainstorming session without distractions or prying photographers, reporters or TV crews. Well, that's the idea.

The reality, however, is that like most family get-togethers there are personality clashes, squabbles about what to eat and what to wear, disputes about who takes centre stage - and even backstabbing and walkouts.

Sunak wants Zahawi probe finished 'as quickly as possible' - live politics updates

""Pretty ghastly - and not very useful"" was the withering verdict of Tony Blair's chief of staff, former Washington diplomat Jonathan Powell, in a memo included in newly released official papers.

And former Blair aide David Miliband, later foreign secretary and now an international aid charity chief, complained that no company would run awaydays in such a haphazard fashion.

This time, around the table at the latest cabinet awayday were two senior figures facing official investigations: a Tory chairman engulfed in a tax scandal and a deputy prime minister reportedly facing no fewer than 24 bullying allegations.

What could possibly go wrong? Lots of embarrassed shuffling of feet and staring at the shoes by all present, at the very least, no doubt.

Chequers, the 16th-century mansion in rolling countryside at the foot of the Chiltern Hills in Buckinghamshire, is a favourite with most prime ministers for their awaydays. It's their official country retreat, after all.

But sometimes grumpy cabinet ministers have been forced to take a train journey to a key political battleground such as the West Midlands or, more recently, a so-called 'red wall' constituency.

Image: In 2018, Theresa May was battling to keep her job as she held an awayday at Chequers

The most disastrous cabinet awayday was in June 2018, when Theresa May thought she'd persuaded her cabinet to back a Brexit deal, but within days David Davis and Boris Johnson had dramatically quit.

But as well as high drama there has been low farce: cabinet ministers told by Mr Johnson to bring maps showing their plans for their department and a one-page slide illustrating their aims.

Awaydays like this have been compared to the Tory ""Thought Camp"" in the TV satire The Thick Of It, held in a country hotel and attended by hapless cabinet minister Peter Mannion.

Surprisingly, considering Tony Blair was renowned for so-called ""sofa government"", with key decisions taken by a small, informal group of allies and cronies, he started the trend, in 1998.

It was Mr Powell who laid down the rules, declaring in one memo released to the archives on the sartorial issue of woolly jumpers or suits: ""TV will film people arriving and going, so there can be no woolly jumpers.""

Peter Mandelson, who famously denies mistaking mushy peas for guacamole in a Hartlepool fish and chip shop, demanded ""something nicer than sandwiches"" and got his wish when a buffet was laid on.

Mr Powell's memos also reveal the tension and rivalry between Mr Blair and Gordon Brown, even in 1998. He wrote to Mr Blair suggesting Mr Brown should lead off with a discussion on the economy.

""You said you did not like this, but I don't see how you can avoid it,"" he wrote. But Mr Blair was having none of it.

""No,"" he replied in a handwritten note. ""We should start with a general political discussion which I should lead, then in (the) afternoon economy.""

And in a 2000 memo, Mr Powell wrote: ""The tradition of a TB/GB (Tony Blair/Gordon Brown) introduction and then one disjointed comment from each cabinet member is pretty ghastly - and not very useful.""

In September 2008, Gordon Brown held what he claimed was the first cabinet meeting outside either Downing Street or Chequers. It was in the West Midlands, a key election battleground.

By sheer coincidence, surely, David Cameron had taken his Tory shadow cabinet there not long before. And it was later revealed that Mr Brown's awaydays had cost taxpayers £600,000.

But the awayday that that will live long in political history was Theresa May's at Chequers in June 2018 when she thought she had a Brexit deal that would keep the UK closely tied to the EU's customs union and single market.

According to folklore, ministers were warned that anyone who resigned would have to walk a mile down the drive and get a lift home with the local taxi firm, whose cards had been left in the foyer.

Some good that did. Truly, the curse of the cabinet awayday had been established.

Image: Theresa May hosting the Cabinet at Chequers, with then-foreign secretary Boris Johnson in the foreground

Recalling that historic day of back-stabbing a year later, Sir Robbie Gibb, Mrs May's director of communications, revealed in a Daily Mail article how the drama unfolded.

""In the sweltering heat, the cabinet had gathered at the prime minister's country retreat where, over eight long and sometimes fractious hours, ministers were talked through Theresa May's proposals for how a new relationship with the European Union could work,"" he wrote.

""It was by no means an easy sell and the atmosphere was tense.

""With discussions over, cabinet unity was toasted with a glass of Churchill's favourite champagne, Pol Roger, and by dinner there was a real sense of coming together.

""Foreign secretary Boris Johnson made a brilliant and jocular toast to the prime minister - who interrupted to say 'If only people could see how united we are now'.""

Image: The makeshift cabinet meeting room at Chequers

However, within 48 hours the Brexit secretary David Davis had resigned, followed by Mr Johnson, who launched not only a ""Chuck Chequers"" campaign but also a campaign to chuck Mrs May out of Downing Street and seize her job for himself.

It was Mr Johnson who held the most recent cabinet awayday, at a pottery in the heart of the 'red wall' in Stoke-on-Trent in May last year, just weeks before his cabinet shattered like broken crockery following the resignations of Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid.

Liz Truss, of course, wasn't prime minister long enough to hold a cabinet awayday. With Mr Sunak under pressure over Nadhim Zahawi, Dominic Raab and countless other woes, will he hold any more?

By Becky Johnson, Midlands correspondent

Over two floors in the West Midlands Ambulance Service headquarters, dozens of staff are continually answering 999 calls.



They pick up with the words ""ambulance service, is the patient breathing?"". Once that is established, they take details in order to respond in the most appropriate way.

As they work, large screens around the room show live data. The more green on the screens, the better things are going. As numbers turn red it's a sign resources are being stretched.

One of the major issues this winter has been ambulances becoming stuck outside busy A&E departments, unable to hand over patients and respond to the next call.

This winter has seen unprecedented handover times. Last month a patient in the West Midlands spent 32 hours and 57 minutes in an ambulance outside A&E. This month the longest wait is 11 hours and 57 minutes.

It's an improvement, but when you consider ambulances should hand patients over in 15 minutes it's clear the pressures are still acute.

By early afternoon today, live data in the control centre showed one ambulance had been waiting outside Shrewsbury hospital for 149 minutes. Another had been waiting at the same hospital for 143 minutes.

In total, 345 ambulances were working across the West Midlands and the live screens were showing just seven were available - although staff stress that when the most serious category one calls come in, ambulances can be diverted from less serious calls.

Assistant chief Jeremy Brown told Sky News they are seeing fewer cases of flu, COVID and Strep A than last month.

They've also created a new system in some of the busier A&Es where space has been created for advanced paramedics to work alongside healthcare assistants to provide a place where patients can be looked after before they formally go into A&E, to enable ambulances to transfer patients and get back on the road more quickly.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126200202/http://news.sky.com/story/nhs-latest-can-the-nhs-survive-watch-our-q-a-as-experts-answer-questions-from-live-audience-12793714

The relative near miss will be streamed live using robotic telescopes - here's what you need to know about the asteroid and how you can watch it.

What do we know about this asteroid?

The asteroid was first spotted on 21 January and has been named asteroid 2023 BU.

It is due to whizz past Earth shortly after midnight on Friday 27 January.

When it passes by at its closest point it will be 3,500km above Earth's surface. That's less than 3% of the average distance between the Earth and the moon.

It may sound like a long way, but this asteroid will be the fourth closest to pass by Earth since records began.

By comparison, most satellites orbit at an altitude of more than 35,000km.

Should I be worried about the asteroid crashing to Earth?

In short, no. The asteroid is between 3.8 and 8.4 metres in size - small enough to incinerate on entering Earth's atmosphere.

Apparently it's roughly the size of an elephant.

According to NASA, asteroids smaller than 25m are likely to burn up, leading to little or no damage on the ground.

Chinouriri said she was scrolling through Instagram and spotted that the Scottish pop star had followed her and tagged her in a story of himself singing her song - I'm Not Perfect (But I'm Trying).

A few months later while drunk, she said she thought it would be a good idea to ask Capaldi if she could join him on tour.

In a 57-second video filmed in the back of a taxi, Chinouriri told Capaldi she would ""happily volunteer as a tribute"" as a supporting act.

I ask her if the ongoing crisis in the health service has made her feel anxious because it might impact on her treatment.

The demand feels endless

Her consultant Dr Asad Ali says extra community support for patients like Ms Hill helps to ease the pressure. But the demand feels endless.

I ask him: ""How do you cope with an ageing population with complex medical problems on the resources that the NHS has?""

Dr Ali tells me: ""Resources are limited... and with us all living longer and living with more complex conditions means yes, we do need more resources to provide care, but we also need to do an appraisal of how best we are utilising our resources and whether we can get more value.""

Since the pandemic respiratory services have been flat out. And there's no end in sight.

I was here in University Hospital Coventry in December 2022, at the height of the flu season. Every bed, in every bay was taken. Since then flu cases have peaked but every bed in every bay is still taken. They're still at 100% capacity. The winter pressures don't simply go away.

And these pressures have long-term impacts. More than seven million people are waiting for elective care in England. A list that was too long before the pandemic and has only become longer. Hospitals like Coventry are looking at innovations to help them to cope and make headway on elective backlog.

Pandemic has forced change

The hospital's chief medical officer, Professor Kiran Patel said the pandemic had forced change, some for the good.

""We mustn't miss the opportunity that a crisis affords to us and one of the benefits is that it will force us to transform the way in which we deliver health care,"" he said.

""We will need to get better at knowing where our demand comes from, what it looks like. So we need to move from being a reactive health service to being a responsive health service, and ultimately being a predictive health service.""

Until that time, patients will keep coming. Across England more than 10,000 patients were brought to an NHS A&E; by ambulance every day. Handover times are at record highs despite staff doing everything they can to diagnose, admit and treat people quickly.

And doctors like Ed Hartley want long-term solutions, not short-term fixes.

""Short-term projects to put a holding pen for ambulances outside the A&E; doesn't fix the NHS,"" he said. ""Short-term projects to help buy some hotel rooms for care home patients or patients who need to leave hospital doesn't fix the NHS.

""Long-term investment in the workforce, long-term investment in the right size of hospitals, and recognising the care sector as a rewarding career with progression, and presumably appropriate pay, will go a long way to helping the NHS.""

Ms Hill hopes she can go home soon. Her needs are long-term, complicated, and challenging. The same as the health service she relies on.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126220218/http://news.sky.com/story/nhs-needs-are-long-term-complicated-and-challenging-12796217

It comes as new data shows that GP waiting times fell in December for the second consecutive month, with the share of people managing to secure an urgent appointment on the same day rising from 69% to 74%.

And separate figures found ambulance handover delays outside hospitals in England have dropped to their lowest level this winter, though one in five patients are still waiting at least half an hour to be transferred to A&E; teams.

Sarah's mother ended up staying for an extended time in hospital and 'dying for no reason'

Sarah Templeton said her mother had been admitted for treatment for a punctured lung, six fractured ribs and a damaged spleen following a fall.

Her mother was in there for four weeks before Ms Templeton was told her loved one could be moved to a discharge and assessment centre.

Ms Templeton said: ""She didn't need to die. She was perfectly well for three weeks. She was bored. She wanted to come out of that hospital.""

She said she could not fault the ""amazing"" medics but added that two doctors on separate occasions told her: ""I'm really sorry Sarah, but this is what happens when you come into hospital now.

""If you come in and you're elderly, or you've got a lower immune system, you will get a chest infection, you will get the flu, you will get pneumonia, and you will die. I said to them: 'Why didn't you tell us that because would have broken her out of here'.

""We would not have left her there. We thought she was in the best place for seven weeks. She died gasping for breath. There was nowhere to take her.""

Ms Templeton said the hospital would not let her take her home as she had to be under the responsibility of the local authority. ""But the local authority didn't look after her. She ended up staying and dying for no reason.""

Janet had a 37-hour wait in A&E; - 'I was bleeding all over my nightdress'

A former practice manager in primary care, Janet said she had two spinal surgeries within 14 days last year and had only just been discharged after the second procedure when she suffered complications and was taken back to hospital in an ambulance.

She said that after about six hours she had a ""lot of tests"" and had a cannula (thin tube) inserted in her arm, before being moved to another part of A&E; which was ""overflowing with patients"".

Janet, from Lancashire, added that she felt ""so sorry"" for the nurses and the doctors. ""Honestly, it was dreadful. There weren't enough staff,"" she said.

She went on to say that during the night in hospital she felt like she needed to use the toilet but realised her catheter bag was ""full and overflowing"".

""I got urine on my nightdress, on the sheets. Also I tried to take my dressing gown off because it was wet with urine and I pulled a cannula out of my arm.

""I was bleeding all over my nightdress. I was shouting desperately for a nurse to come and help me and got to the stage where I got myself up and sat on the edge of the trolley and started to cry.""

Amy was moved to a different hospital during labour

Amy, from Essex, says she had originally planned to go to a midwifery-led unit but during her pregnancy it shut down due to staffing issues.

She ended up having to go to her nearest hospital, which is an hour away, but due to her not going there for appointments she was sent to a day assessment unit rather than the maternity ward to give birth to her daughter.

""I actually ended up nearly having her in the corridor because there wasn't anywhere for me to go,"" she said.

Describing her maternity care, she added: ""After I had her, I was due to be stitched up but I was actually left for about three hours after having her due to a shift change.

""But the lady who did end up coming in to do my stitches apologised profusely. It was no fault of her own. She was honest, which I appreciated. She just said, 'I'm really sorry'.""

Ezra 'can't praise NHS staff enough'

Cancer patient Ezra, from Lincoln, said he ""can't praise enough"" those who looked after him and the fast turnaround between when he was first diagnosed and then had surgery.

Ezra said he had a PSA blood test which can help detect prostate cancer.

He had a raised level and was asked to come into his GP surgery the day after the result came in, and had an examination.

Ezra said he was then put on to a two-week cancer care wait and within a fortnight he had an MRI scan at his local hospital. He also had a biopsy and a bone scan, and a urologist talked him through the whole procedure for his cancer.

He asked if the surgery could be after Christmas and he went into his local hospital early this month.

Recalling his time there, Ezra said: ""One night about 3am, a nurse came up to me. I think it was a 10-bed ward and all the men were sleeping. Very quietly with a little light on, so not to disturb me, she did my blood pressure, my oxygen levels. These people, they're not heroes, they're professionals. And I really can't praise them enough.""

Officers are still looking into the motive of the attack, but a National Court judge is investigating it as a possible act of terrorism.

The suspect, identified as 25-year-old Yassine Kanjaa, is believed to have acted alone.

Police searched his home to ""determine the nature, terrorist or otherwise"", of the assault, according to Spanish interior minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska.

Image: People gather for a minute's silence for the church worker killed in the attack

The interior ministry said the suspect is a Moroccan citizen with no prior criminal record ""in Spain or any other country"".

It added that the suspect had been under a deportation order since June last year because of his unauthorised migrant status in Spain.

Kanjaa had previously been arrested in neighbouring Gibraltar, which sits across a bay from Algeciras, in August 2019 when he attempted to ""come ashore from a jet-ski without the necessary documentation"", authorities said. He was deported days later.

Wednesday night's attacks have shaken the multicultural city located near the southern tip of Spain.

Witnesses claim that in the second incident, the attacker jumped on the altar of the Church of Nuestra Senora de La Palma, wielding a machete.

He then attacked a church worker who was preparing Mass inside the church and chased him into a town square before killing him.

Earlier, a priest had been wounded at the San Isidro church, just minutes away from Nuestra Senora de La Palma.

The injured priest, Antonio Rodriguez, is now back in his community following the ordeal.

Image: Residents gather after a minute of silence for a church sacristan who was killed in Algeciras

The Algeciras town hall identified the dead church worker as Diego Valencia.

Another man who worked alongside Mr Valencia at the church, Manolo Gonzalez, said the suspect climbed on the altar and Mr Valencia came out ""and asked to know what was going on"".

Candles and flowers adorned the two small churches with whitewashed walls on Thursday, while flags were flown at half-mast in Algeciras.

A minute's silence and a vigil were also observed by the community, including a significant contingent from the city's Moroccan population.

The family of victim Mr Valencia gathered inside Nuestra Senora de La Palma to receive the condolences of minister Mr Grande-Marlaska and concerned residents.

The cosmopolitan port city of Algeciras is the first point of arrival for many boats and ferries from North Africa, prompting governmental debates on irregular migration.

Sarah Templeton says her mother died ""gasping for breath"" after an extended stay in hospital.

She describes how her mother went into hospital on 11 November and while she had Parkinson's, it was ""very well managed"".



""She used to fall over a lot and it was very common. She used to fall over three of four times a day,"" she says.

""But this one time she fell over she did more damage than normal and the doctor sent her to hospital because they thought she had a stroke.

""She hadn't had a stroke, she had punctured a lung and that was why she couldn't breathe. She went into hospital and had six fractured ribs, a punctured lung and a damaged spleen.

""She ended up staying there for seven weeks and during that seven weeks we were told at one point she had COVID.

""I do stress we kept her COVID-free all the way through COVID and we had kept her flu-free as well. We did everything the government told us to do. In hospital, she was moved wards and we all had to wear masks.""

She says at one point she asked the doctor how her mother was doing and he told her that she ""never had COVID"".

Four weeks in, Sarah was told her mother was ""medically fit"" and she could be moved but it did not happen.

""And then she got a chest infection and then the flu and then pneumonia. And we sat holding her hand while she died,"" she says.

""My mum didn't need to die. My mum was perfectly well for three weeks.""

She adds: ""I had to watch her with masks on her face gasping for breath. My mother died gasping for breath.""

A chief nurse of Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said: ""We would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of Jennifer Storey and would be happy to meet with the family to discuss any concerns they have about her care.

""Our trust works closely with local social care organisations to help patients return to their own home or care home as soon as it is safe and appropriate for them to do so, this includes helping to train care home staff in managing patients who have complex needs.""

642;Earth to have near miss with asteroid in the coming hours - here's all you need to know;Thursday 26 January 2023 12:35, UK;[];['nasa'];['earth', 'need', 'virtual', 'small', 'hours', 'earths', 'near', 'miss', 'website', 'close', 'asteroid', 'know', 'watch', 'telescopes', 'nasa', 'coming', 'heres'];"An asteroid is to come very close to Earth in the coming hours, passing just a few thousand kilometres above the planet's surface.

The relative near miss will be streamed live using robotic telescopes - here's what you need to know about the asteroid and how you can watch it.

What do we know about this asteroid?

The asteroid was first spotted on 21 January and has been named asteroid 2023 BU.

NASA said ""a small near-Earth asteroid will have a very close encounter with our planet"" as it ""zooms over the southern tip of South America"".

It is due to whizz past Earth shortly after midnight on Friday 27 January.

When it passes by at its closest point it will be 2,200 miles above Earth's surface. That's less than 3% of the average distance between the Earth and the moon.

It may sound like a long way, but this asteroid will be the fourth closest to pass by Earth since records began.

By comparison, some satellites orbit at an altitude of more than 21,000 miles.

Should I be worried about the asteroid crashing to Earth?

In short, no. The asteroid is between 3.8 and 8.4 metres in size - small enough to incinerate on entering Earth's atmosphere.

Apparently it's roughly the size of an elephant.

According to NASA, asteroids smaller than 25m are likely to burn up, leading to little or no damage on the ground.

What is an asteroid?

An asteroid is a ""relatively small, inactive body orbiting the Sun"", according to NASA. It's normally made of rocky, dusty, and metallic materials.

Most orbit within the main asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but some follow paths that circulate into the inner solar system (including near-Earth asteroids).

643;Tyre Nichols: Five ex-officers charged with murder over father-of-one's death after 'three-minute police beating';Thursday 26 January 2023 22:27, UK;[];['tennessee'];['officers', 'fatherofones', 'tyre', 'death', 'exofficers', 'charged', 'department', 'black', 'video', 'nichols', 'threeminute', 'family', 'murder', 'memphis', 'beating', 'footage'];"A grand jury has indicted five former police officers on murder and other charges in connection with the death of Tyre Nichols.

US President Joe Biden called for any protests to be peaceful following the charges on Thursday.

Nichols, 29, died in hospital three days after a confrontation during a traffic stop in the US city of Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

The father of one had been arrested after being stopped for reckless driving, police said, before being allegedly beaten by the officers for three minutes.

Five black officers involved in the arrest were subsequently sacked after a police investigation found they used excessive force or failed to intervene and help him.

Officials are expected to release bodycam footage of the incident on Friday evening.

""We're here today because of a tragedy that wounds one family deeply but also hurts us all,"" district attorney Steve Mulroy said at a news conference.

He added that the five officers have been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping and official misconduct.

The Memphis Police Department identified them as Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills, Jr, and Justin Smith, who are all black and aged between 24 and 32.

Each officer had served with the department for around two and a half to five years, and were dismissed from the force last Saturday.

Meanwhile, two Memphis Fire Department employees who were involved in the response were also relieved of their duties during an investigation, a department spokesperson said earlier this week.

President Biden said in a statement: ""Outrage is understandable, but violence is never acceptable.

""Tyre's death is a painful reminder that we must do more to ensure that our criminal justice system lives up to the promise of fair and impartial justice, equal treatment and dignity for all.""

Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis said on Wednesday that other police officers remain under investigation for police infractions.

In a video shared on YouTube, she asked for calm when the bodycam footage is made public.

""I expect you to feel what the Nichols family feels. I expect you to feel outrage in the disregard of basic human rights,"" she said.

""I expect our citizens to exercise their First Amendment right to protest, to demand action and results, but we need to ensure our community is safe in this process.""

Several recent incidents of police brutality against black people in the US have sparked outrage and calls for reforms in policing.

Second-degree murder will go a considerable distance in meeting public's expectations James Matthews US correspondent @jamesmatthewsky America has been here before. A black man dead at the hands of police officers, brutality captured on camera. Rodney King and George Floyd are just two names that define a deadly dysfunction in the institution that exists to protect and serve. Now add Tyre Nichols - 29 years old, a father and family man who worked at FedEx and enjoyed skateboarding. ""Nobody’s perfect,"" said his mother RowVaugn. ""But he was damn near."" We are told the events leading up to his death are contained in a video lasting an hour, multiple angles of what has been trailed as a savage assault. A lawyer for the Nichols family spoke of him being beaten ""like a human pinata"". The Friday night release of the footage is shrouded by a sense of dread. Experience shows it is shocking video content of a sort liable to ignite violent street protests and, in Memphis, they are aware of the danger. It explains why the build-up to the release of the footage has been choreographed around charges for the police officers involved. In a place where the public demands accountability, laying charges of second-degree murder will go a considerable distance towards matching expectations. Murder in the second degree accuses the officers of knowingly killing Mr Nichols. Does it make a difference that the five men in uniform were black? Perhaps. Time will tell if, and how, that plays into the wider public response. Much of the reaction, so far, has focused on the power that police have and the inclination to abuse it with deadly consequences. In video form, evidence of it will soon be laid bare - and Memphis is braced.

The Nichols family watched the police footage on Monday with their lawyer, Ben Crump, who compared the beating to the 1991 Los Angeles police assault on Rodney King that was captured on video and sparked protests and police reforms.

""He was defenceless the entire time. He was a human pinata for those police officers,"" Antonio Romanucci, Mr Crump's co-counsel, told reporters.

Mr Crump said Nichols' last words heard on the video were of him calling for his mother three times.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126224735/http://news.sky.com/story/tyre-nichols-five-ex-officers-charged-with-murder-over-father-of-ones-death-after-three-minute-police-beating-12796236

""Sir Jeremy Fleming, director GCHQ, has today announced his decision to step down at the end of his tenure later this year,"" GCHQ said in a statement.

""In line with normal practice, there will be an internal civil service competition to identify a successor. Sir Jeremy and the board will continue to lead and oversee work at GCHQ until the summer.""

Despite the potential immediate threat posed by Russia, Sir Jeremy previously warned in an interview of China's use of technology to attack satellite systems, control digital currencies, and to control dissent by tracking individuals.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that China was the ""real long-term threat"" to UK national security - claiming the country was ""deploying its ideologies in ways that we think are against our national interests"".

Merseyside Police said they arrested a 20-year-old man on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and assisting an offender in the Barnston area of Wirral.

He has been taken to a police station for questioning.

Connor Chapman, 22, has already been charged with murdering Ms Edwards and a trial date has been scheduled for 7 June.

Ms Edwards was celebrating with friends when a gunman opened fire at the Lighthouse pub in Wallasey Village, Wirral, shortly before midnight.

She is not believed to have been the intended target of the attack, which also injured four men.

Hundreds of mourners gathered for her funeral yesterday at St Nicholas Church in Wallasey.

The funeral cortege was led by a hearse with a tribute of flowers that read ""Elle"", while her coffin was brought in a carriage pulled by four white horses.

The order of service asked for donations to the Elle Edwards Foundation in her memory.

648;Tyre Nichols killing: Memphis braces as five ex-officers charged with murder over father-of-one who was beaten like 'a human pinata';Thursday 26 January 2023 22:37, UK;[];['tennessee'];['fatherofone', 'officers', 'human', 'killing', 'tyre', 'pinata', 'exofficers', 'charged', 'department', 'black', 'video', 'nichols', 'family', 'murder', 'memphis', 'footage'];"A grand jury has indicted five former police officers on murder and other charges in connection with the death of Tyre Nichols.

US President Joe Biden called for any protests to be peaceful following the charges on Thursday.

Nichols, 29, died in hospital three days after a confrontation during a traffic stop in the US city of Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

The father of one had been arrested after being stopped for reckless driving, police said, before being allegedly beaten by the officers for three minutes.

Five black officers involved in the arrest were subsequently sacked after a police investigation found they used excessive force or failed to intervene and help him.

Officials are expected to release bodycam footage of the incident on Friday evening.

""We're here today because of a tragedy that wounds one family deeply but also hurts us all,"" district attorney Steve Mulroy said at a news conference.

He added that the five officers have been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping and official misconduct.

The Memphis Police Department identified them as Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills, Jr, and Justin Smith, who are all black and aged between 24 and 32.

Each officer had served with the department for around two and a half to five years, and were dismissed from the force last Saturday.

Meanwhile, two Memphis Fire Department employees who were involved in the response were also relieved of their duties during an investigation, a department spokesperson said earlier this week.

President Biden said in a statement: ""Outrage is understandable, but violence is never acceptable.

""Tyre's death is a painful reminder that we must do more to ensure that our criminal justice system lives up to the promise of fair and impartial justice, equal treatment and dignity for all.""

Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis said on Wednesday that other police officers remain under investigation for police infractions.

In a video shared on YouTube, she asked for calm when the bodycam footage is made public.

""I expect you to feel what the Nichols family feels. I expect you to feel outrage in the disregard of basic human rights,"" she said.

""I expect our citizens to exercise their First Amendment right to protest, to demand action and results, but we need to ensure our community is safe in this process.""

Several recent incidents of police brutality against black people in the US have sparked outrage and calls for reforms in policing.

Second-degree murder will go a considerable distance in meeting public's expectations James Matthews US correspondent @jamesmatthewsky America has been here before. A black man dead at the hands of police officers, brutality captured on camera. Rodney King and George Floyd are just two names that define a deadly dysfunction in the institution that exists to protect and serve. Now add Tyre Nichols - 29 years old, a father and family man who worked at FedEx and enjoyed skateboarding. ""Nobody’s perfect,"" said his mother RowVaugn. ""But he was damn near."" We are told the events leading up to his death are contained in a video lasting an hour, multiple angles of what has been trailed as a savage assault. A lawyer for the Nichols family spoke of him being beaten ""like a human pinata"". The Friday night release of the footage is shrouded by a sense of dread. Experience shows it is shocking video content of a sort liable to ignite violent street protests and, in Memphis, they are aware of the danger. It explains why the build-up to the release of the footage has been choreographed around charges for the police officers involved. In a place where the public demands accountability, laying charges of second-degree murder will go a considerable distance towards matching expectations. Murder in the second degree accuses the officers of knowingly killing Mr Nichols. Does it make a difference that the five men in uniform were black? Perhaps. Time will tell if, and how, that plays into the wider public response. Much of the reaction, so far, has focused on the power that police have and the inclination to abuse it with deadly consequences. In video form, evidence of it will soon be laid bare - and Memphis is braced.

The Nichols family watched the police footage on Monday with their lawyer, Ben Crump, who compared the beating to the 1991 Los Angeles police assault on Rodney King that was captured on video and sparked protests and police reforms.

""He was defenceless the entire time. He was a human pinata for those police officers,"" Antonio Romanucci, Mr Crump's co-counsel, told reporters.

Mr Crump said Nichols' last words heard on the video were of him calling for his mother three times.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230126234909/http://news.sky.com/story/tyre-nichols-killing-memphis-braces-as-five-ex-officers-charged-with-murder-over-father-of-one-who-was-beaten-like-a-human-pinata-12796236
649;Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to dismiss 'gloom' about economy - but set to resist calls for tax cuts;Friday 27 January 2023 01:16, UK;[];[];['plan', 'growth', 'say', 'set', 'british', 'resist', 'cuts', 'tax', 'support', 'economy', 'world', 'uk', 'gloom', 'dismiss', 'speech', 'chancellor', 'hunt', 'jeremy'];"The chancellor will dismiss ""gloom"" about the prospects for the UK economy and say the government will bring about long-term prosperity in a plan ""energised"" by Brexit.

Mr Hunt will deliver an upbeat message in a keynote speech today, where he will say the government has a plan to use ""British genius and British hard work"" to boost economic growth and make the country ""the world's next Silicon Valley"".

He will go on to say the UK is ""poised to play a leading role in Europe and across the world in the growth sectors which will define this century"".

According to advance extracts from his speech released by the Treasury, he will also say ""declinism about Britain was wrong in the past and it is wrong today"".

Speaking at Bloomberg's European headquarters in London, Mr Hunt is also expected to continue to resist calls from some Tory MPs for tax cuts to kickstart flagging economic growth.

Instead he will say the UK should exploit the opportunities provided by the UK's withdrawal from the EU to raise productivity while using the proceeds of growth to support public services.

Mr Hunt will say that some of the ""gloom"" about the current economic outlook is based on statistics that ""do not reflect the whole picture"".

""Like every G7 country, our growth was slower in the years after the financial crisis than the years before it,"" he will say.

""But since 2010, the UK has grown faster than France, Japan and Italy. Since the Brexit referendum, we have grown at about the same rate as Germany.

""If we look further ahead, the case for declinism becomes weaker still. The UK is poised to play a leading role in Europe and across the world in the growth sectors which will define this century.""

Mr Hunt will also say: ""Our plan for the years that follow is long-term prosperity based on British genius and British hard work.

""(And) world-beating enterprises to make Britain the world's next Silicon Valley.""

The chancellor will add: ""It is a plan necessitated, energised and made possible by Brexit which will succeed if it becomes a catalyst for the bold choices we need to take.

""Our plan for growth is a plan built on the freedoms which Brexit provides. It is a plan to raise productivity.

""It is a plan to use the proceeds of growth to support our public services at home, to support businesses in the new low-carbon economy and to support democracy abroad.

""It is the right course for our country and the role in the world to which we aspire.""

Mr Hunt will also use his speech to announce that the government is to proceed with reforms to so-called ""Solvency II"" - an EU directive that governs the amount of funds British insurers are required to hold in reserve.

The Treasury pointed to an estimate by the Association of British Insurers which suggested the changes could unlock up to £100bn of private investment into UK infrastructure and clean energy - such as nuclear power - over the coming decade.

His address will come after a cabinet away day at Chequers yesterday, where Mr Hunt told ministers they must maintain their ""disciplined approach"" if they are to get inflation under control.

The chancellor is facing calls from some Tory MPs to cut taxes in his budget in March to inject growth into the economy.

But at Chequers, both he and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak emphasised the priority remained inflation which was only predicted to fall because of the ""tough decisions"" taken to stabilise the economy following former PM Liz Truss's catastrophic mini-budget tax giveaway.

""The chancellor said it would be necessary to retain this disciplined approach in order to reduce inflation, because it is the greatest driver of the cost of living,"" according to a No 10 readout of the meeting.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127020206/http://news.sky.com/story/chancellor-jeremy-hunt-to-dismiss-gloom-about-economy-but-set-to-resist-calls-for-tax-cuts-12796298

And you only had to listen to the heart-wrenching stories of the audience during a live Sky News programme on the NHS at Coventry Hospital for the reality of that to be laid bare.

There was James, whose wife died after waiting too long for an ambulance - and Sarah, whose mum died from an infection in hospital after waiting too long to be discharged into community care.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:18 'NHS can survive if people fight for it'

Stories that provoked gasps of horror and expressions of distress from the audience, as those around them recounted how they lost loved ones in a health system on its knees.

And as the stories of failings were shared, the obvious question that followed was whether the NHS can survive in its current form, or if it needs a radical rethink.

This is of course an intensely political question, given that it is governments that decide how much investment should be put into the health system, sort out the infrastructure, and decide how it should be organised.

There is a growing discussion in Westminster about how the NHS should be funded, with the former health secretary Sajid Javid telling me last year that he doesn't believe the NHS can survive and the country needs an ""honest conversation"" about how we pay for healthcare.

He thinks the UK should look to European neighbours that have a mix of private insurance and state provision, where patients pay some money for services. He recently said those who can afford it should also pay to see a GP.

But this wasn't a view shared by our audience, with many shaking their heads when I reflected some of the political discussion back in Westminster around the future of the NHS.

As Phil Brown, a retired children's nurse, said: ""As Nye Bevan [the founder of the NHS] put it, the NHS will survive for as long as there are people even now who are prepared to fight for it.

""Give back an elective nurses council, take away the parking charges, give us a four-day week, we will graft... and watch what all NHS staff can do.""

The audience reflected wider public sentiment, according to Hugh Alderwick, director of policy at the Health Foundation.

""Polling shows strong support for the core principles of the NHS, including it being free at the point of use, available to all and predominantly funded through tax,"" he said. ""The public want a better health service, rather than a different system and they back additional spending to supply it, with 71% thinking greater government investment in the NHS is necessary.""

But if the audience seemed to agree with the principle of an NHS free at the point of use and funded through taxation, the politicians are not offering comprehensive solutions to how to end a crisis that was beginning long before the COVID pandemic.

Chronic staff shortages, the need for more investment, a plan to fix adult social care and weak capital investment in buildings, equipment and IT, are some of the big problems facing the NHS but our politicians tend to deal in sticking plasters not real solutions.

The most obvious example being the ditching of Boris Johnson's £12bn-a-year plan to better fund the NHS and social care through a National Insurance tax rise and a cap on individual care costs to protect the elderly from exorbitant costs.

That successive government inaction now hitting home with ambulance delays, bed blocking and high levels of unmet needs.

But on both sides of the political divide, parties are for now unwilling to grasp the nettle.

The Conservatives have delayed social care reform until after the next general election. They have promised a plan on improving emergency care, access and workforce to deal with acute staffing shortages, but there is a private admission within government that it is unlikely that patients will feel much improvement in services before an election and there is certainly no talk of increased investment.

Labour too is unwilling to commit to more funding, anxious that they open up a line of attack from the Conservatives if it commits to spending plans for the NHS.

As deputy leader Angela Rayner put it to me in a recent interview, Labour will focus on reforming the NHS - a big push on changing the way GP surgeries work and increasing preventative medicine - rather than raising taxes to pay for it.

The ""retail offer"" from Labour is to pay for more doctors and nurses by scrapping non-dom tax status and funnelling the estimated £3.2bn that will raise into extra training places.

Lord Winston, the IVF pioneer who has worked in the NHS for nearly six decades, told me last week he had never seen it so bad and said he believed more funding would be inevitable. He urged Sir Keir Starmer to show more ""courage"" when it came to resolving the problems of the NHS.

Her family was rounded up by Adolf Hitler's forces and forced to march to a labour camp in the Polish village of Adampol in 1943.

Hannah's father Adam escaped the camp to join the partisans - a Jewish resistance movement during the Second World War - and returned to warn of an imminent Nazi raid, the night before his wife's death.

Hannah's mother Haya refused to flee, fearing her daughter - who had fallen ill with a high temperature and suspected typhoid - would not survive.

""For as long as I live, I will always wonder how she got through that night,"" Hannah tells Sky's Sophy Ridge.

""How she made the decision she made? Was it right?""

The next morning, Hannah heard ""yelling"" and ""screaming"" following the arrival of the Einsatzgruppen, the Nazis' mobile killing unit responsible for the mass shooting of Jews.

""Suddenly there was a whack on the door and my mother - with great dignity - got on her knees, took me in her arms, and gave me a hug and a kiss,"" Hannah says.

""She didn't run, she didn't make a sound. She walked to the door, opened the door and closed it firmly behind her.

""I waited for her to come back... but she didn't come back.""

Image: Hannah Lewis's mother Haya (pictured) was shot dead in front of her

'Blood on the snow'

Hannah, an only child, went to look for her mother and watched as Haya and others were ""shoved"" in front of a well in the village.

She remembers her mother appeared calm but wouldn't give eye contact to her.

""I decided that I would go down and take her hand, the way I always did,"" says Hannah, fighting back tears.

""As I was about to go in bare feet, somebody shouted an order and they started to shoot.

""I saw her fall… and I saw the blood on the snow.""

As well as her mother, Hannah's grandfather, her uncle and her younger cousin Shlomo were also murdered at Adampol.

Now aged 85 and living in north London, Hannah is sharing her experience to mark Holocaust Memorial Day, the anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau.

Six million Jewish men, women and children were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust. In her family, only Hannah and her father survived.

Image: Hannah pictured before she was forcibly marched to a labour camp

'I never forgave myself for losing my cousin'

Hannah described her cousin Shlomo - who was deaf and unable to speak - as ""the brother I never had"" and ""the one person that I absolutely adored"".

She recalls being outside at the camp with the little boy, who was aged about three, when she heard the sound of Nazi vehicles pulling up.

""He couldn't hear and he couldn't speak so I took his hand,"" Hannah says. ""I pulled it so he knew he had to come and we ran in to the nearest barn.""

Hannah says she dived into a mound of straw where she and Shlomo would often hide but she realised he wasn't there.

She was about to leave her hiding place to find him when she saw her cousin standing by the barn door.

""The door swung open and (the Nazis) saw him and they picked him up literally by the scruff of his neck,"" she says.

""My last sight of my lovely cousin was his back… and his legs kicking. I never saw him again.

""When I lost Shlomo I never forgave myself.""

Image: Hannah pictured with her cousin Shlomo

Going into hiding

Hannah's family had been living in the small market town of Włodawa in Poland when the Nazis invaded.

""Suddenly there was a curfew,"" she says. ""And suddenly my grandfather couldn't trade. And suddenly you had to wear a mark.

""I remember my father, before it got really bad, putting me in a sled and taking me to a photographer.

""I'm standing there trying to smile and I've got tears in my eyes because I know that something horrible is happening and it's not right.

""I was probably six.""

The family initially went into hiding, staying in a barn which required a ""special knock"" to gain entry.

""There were two or three other families there and when they saw me, they were not best pleased,"" Hannah says.

""They did not want to hide with children.""

After one night there, Hannah says ""suddenly the barn door flew open"" and ""everybody froze"".

She recalls seeing ""the tip of very shiny boots"" and the peaked hats of Nazi soldiers as they ""poked around"".

""We sat there like statues,"" Hannah says.

'Luck ran out'

While the family narrowly avoided being found that time, Hannah says eventually their ""luck run out"" and they were given an hour to pack up their belongings.

Aged just six, Hannah says she walked for nearly five hours to the labour camp at Adampol.

""If you tripped, or if you fell, no one helped hold you up,"" she says.

""I remember them just shooting somebody.""

After arriving at the camp, there was no electricity or running water and the security measures included barbed wire fencing and a watchtower.

Then just a little girl, Hannah tried to cope with the trauma of witnessing her mother's death, and initially refused to believe she had been killed.

Instead, she convinced herself that Haya was injured and pretending to be dead to save herself.

It was only after being liberated by a Soviet soldier, and reunited with her father - who had also witnessed his wife's murder - that the reality dawned on Hannah.

""He got hold of me, he laughed, he cried, he cuddled me,"" she says of her father.

""I said: 'Where's mama?' He said: 'Mama's not coming back. Mama died. You saw it.'

""I remember him shaking me because apparently for a couple of hours I didn't utter one sound.""

Image: Hannah pictured with her father Adam

'Children ask: Do you hate the Germans?'

After the war, Hannah and her father lived in the Polish city of Lodz and she admits she became ""jealous"" of other children who had both parents.

She moved to Britain in 1949 to live with her great aunt and uncle, while her father left Poland for Israel in 1953.

She married in 1961 and has four children and eight grandchildren, and now shares her experience of the Holocaust in schools and universities.

""Every now and again the kids say: 'Do you tell your story because you hate the Germans?',"" she says.

""I say no, I tell my story because I care for you.

Soaring inflation means plans for the high-speed rail project to run to central London may be scrapped completely, with trains instead stopping at a new hub at Old Oak Common in west London's suburbs, The Sun reports.

Commuters would have to finish their journeys into the city centre by using the Elizabeth Line.

The paper also reported that a two-to-five-year delay to the entire project, currently due to be completed between 2029 and 2033, is being considered.

In a comment, a Department for Transport spokesman said: ""The government remains committed to delivering HS2 to Manchester, as confirmed in the autumn statement.

""As well as supporting tens of thousands of jobs, the project will connect regions across the UK, improve capacity on our railways and provide a greener option of travel.""

HS2's website still features plans for the trains to travel to Euston and says a new station there will have 10 450m platforms.

It adds that the station will be used by up to 17 high-speed trains per hour at ""peak operation"".

The HS2 project has been dogged by criticism over its financial and environmental impact.

In October 2021, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove suggested capital investment for HS2 would be reviewed, but Chancellor Jeremy Hunt subsequently backed the project.

The target cost of Phase 1 between London and Birmingham was £40.3bn at 2019 prices.

A budget of £55.7bn for the whole of HS2 was set in 2015.

Penny Gaines of the campaign group Stop HS2 said it is ""not at all surprising"" that costs are spiralling out of control.

She added: ""These reports just show that there are so many problems with HS2. It's being delayed further and further so the cost is going up, it should be cancelled in its entirety as soon as possible.

""Stop spending money building a railway people don't need. Use the money to restore the countryside and the areas that are being devastated by HS2 and look at the solutions that people need in the 21st century.

While the wreck sank in 1672 and was discovered in 2019 off the coast of Sussex, until now it was known as the ""Unknown Wreck off Eastbourne"".

However, scientists have now identified the wreck as the Dutch warship Klein Hollandia.

Built in 1656 and owned by the Admiralty of Rotterdam, the ship was involved in all major battles in the second Anglo-Dutch war from 1665 to 1667.

Over the past year, specialists from Historic England, the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands and the Nautical Archaeology Society have been working on identifying the ship.

They used evidence gathered from the wreck, as well as archival research and tree ring analysis of the wood samples.

Experts say the wreck's condition is remarkable and could offer a wealth of information about how 17th-century Dutch ships were built and the activities of the warship during its final voyage.

Heritage minister Lord Parkinson said the identification ""offers a glimpse back into the 17th century, giving us a chance to learn more about the maritime history of this period and to uncover treasures which have been underwater for hundreds of years"".

Upon its discovery, the wreck was considered so important that it was granted the highest level of protection in the same year, under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973.

A large part of the wooden hull, cannons, Italian marble tiles and pieces of Italian pottery were among the material found on the seabed.

The marble tiles came from the Apuan Alps quarries close to Carrara in Italy.

The tiles were bound for the Netherlands and would have been used to build high-status homes.

The wreck was discovered by Eastbourne dive operator David Ronnan and reported to Historic England. Mr Ronnan and Mark Beattie-Edwards are the licensees and have been investigating the wreck.

US President Joe Biden called for any protests to be peaceful following the charges on Thursday.

Nichols, 29, died in hospital three days after a confrontation during a traffic stop in the US city of Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

The father of one had been arrested after being stopped for reckless driving, police said, before being allegedly beaten by the officers for three minutes.

Five black officers involved in the arrest were subsequently sacked after a police investigation found they used excessive force or failed to intervene and help him.

Officials are expected to release bodycam footage of the incident on Friday evening.

Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis has asked for calm when the video footage is made public.

""I expect you to feel what the Nichols family feels,"" she said. ""I expect you to feel outrage in the disregard of basic human rights.""

David Rausch, the director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, said at the news conference he was sickened by what he saw in the police body-worn camera videos.

""What happened here does not at all reflect proper policing,"" he said. ""This was wrong. This was criminal.""

Meanwhile, district attorney Steve Mulroy said at a news conference on Thursday that after Mr Nichols was stopped in his vehicle, there was ""an altercation"" in which officers used pepper spray on him.

Mr Nichols fled on foot.

""There was another altercation at a nearby location at which the serious injuries were experienced by Mr Nichols,"" Mr Mulroy added.

The initial Memphis Police Department statement about the death had said an ambulance was called because Mr Nichols ""complained of having a shortness of breath"" and that he was taken to hospital in critical condition.

Mr Mulroy said he would not comment on the legality of the initial traffic stop.

He said the investigation would continue and he would not rule out additional charges.

Mr Mulroy added that the five officers have been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping and official misconduct.

The Memphis Police Department identified them as Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills, Jr, and Justin Smith, who are all black and aged between 24 and 32.

Each officer had served with the department for around two and a half to five years, and were dismissed from the force last Saturday.

The former officers could not be reached for comment.

Blake Ballin, a lawyer representing Mills, said at a news conference the former officer was ""devastated to find himself charged with a crime"".

Ballin was joined by William Massey, representing Martin. both lawyers said they had not yet seen the video that

would be released on Friday and were still developing their defenses. Their clients were each posting a bond to be released from jail on Thursday, they said.

Both former officers intended to plead not guilty, their lawyers said.

Meanwhile, two Memphis Fire Department employees who were involved in the response were also relieved of their duties during an investigation, a department spokesperson said earlier this week.

Second-degree murder will go a considerable distance in meeting public expectations America has been here before. A black man dead at the hands of police officers, with the brutality captured on camera. Rodney King and George Floyd are just two names that define a deadly dysfunction in the institution that exists to protect and serve. Now add Tyre Nichols - 29 years old, a father and family man who worked at FedEx and enjoyed skateboarding. ""Nobody's perfect,"" said his mother RowVaugn, ""But he was damn near"". We are told the events leading up to his death are contained in a video lasting an hour, multiple angles of what has been trailed as a savage assault. A lawyer for the Nichols family spoke of him being beaten ""like a human pinata"". The Friday night release of the footage is shrouded by a sense of dread, given its potential to ignite violent street protest of the sort seen in the wake of the 2020 killing of George Floyd. In Memphis, they are aware of the danger. It explains why the build-up to the release of the footage has been choreographed around charges for the police officers involved. In a place where the public demands accountability, laying charges of second-degree murder will go a considerable distance towards meeting expectations. Charges of murder in the second degree accuse the officers of knowingly killing Mr Nichols. Does it make a difference that the five men in uniform were black? Perhaps. Time will tell if, and how, that plays into the wider public response. President Biden framed it thus: ""Tyre's death is a painful reminder that we must do more to ensure that our criminal justice system lives up to the promise of fair and impartial justice, equal treatment and dignity for all. ""We also cannot ignore the fact that fatal encounters with law enforcement have disparately impacted black and brown people."" It is a matter of power and its abuse. The latest episode will soon be laid bare - and Memphis is braced.

President Biden said in a statement: ""Outrage is understandable, but violence is never acceptable.

""Tyre's death is a painful reminder that we must do more to ensure that our criminal justice system lives up to the promise of fair and impartial justice, equal treatment and dignity for all.""

Several recent incidents of police brutality against black people in the US have sparked outrage and calls for reforms in policing.

The Nichols family watched the police footage on Monday with their lawyer, Ben Crump, who compared the beating to the 1991 Los Angeles police assault on Rodney King that was captured on video and sparked protests and police reforms.

""He was defenceless the entire time. He was a human pinata for those police officers,"" Antonio Romanucci, Mr Crump's co-counsel, told reporters.

Mr Crump said Nichols' last words heard on the video were of him calling for his mother three times.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127033213/http://news.sky.com/story/tyre-nichols-killing-fear-of-unrest-in-memphis-as-sickening-bodycam-footage-of-violent-fatal-traffic-stop-set-to-be-released-12796236
656;Holocaust Memorial Day: Survivor describes horror of watching Nazi death squad kill her mother;Friday 27 January 2023 02:31, UK;['david mercer', '@davidmercersky'];['holocaust', 'poland', 'world war two'];['kill', 'father', 'memorial', 'nazi', 'door', 'shlomo', 'camp', 'squad', 'saw', 'holocaust', 'family', 'survivor', 'horror', 'describes', 'watching', 'cousin', 'mother', 'hannah'];"Hannah Lewis was just seven years old when she watched a Nazi death squad execute her mother.

Her family was rounded up by Adolf Hitler's forces and forced to march to a labour camp in the Polish village of Adampol in 1943.

Hannah's father Adam escaped the camp to join the partisans - a Jewish resistance movement during the Second World War - and returned to warn of an imminent Nazi raid, the night before his wife's death.

Hannah's mother Haya refused to flee, fearing her daughter - who had fallen ill with a high temperature and suspected typhoid - would not survive.

""For as long as I live, I will always wonder how she got through that night,"" Hannah tells Sky's Sophy Ridge.

""How she made the decision she made? Was it right?""

The next morning, Hannah heard ""yelling"" and ""screaming"" following the arrival of the Einsatzgruppen, the Nazis' mobile killing unit responsible for the mass shooting of Jews.

""Suddenly there was a whack on the door and my mother - with great dignity - got on her knees, took me in her arms, and gave me a hug and a kiss,"" Hannah says.

""She didn't run, she didn't make a sound. She walked to the door, opened the door and closed it firmly behind her.

""I waited for her to come back... but she didn't come back.""

'Blood on the snow'

Hannah, an only child, went to look for her mother and watched as Haya and others were ""shoved"" in front of a well in the village.

She remembers her mother appeared calm but wouldn't give eye contact to her.

""I decided that I would go down and take her hand, the way I always did,"" says Hannah, fighting back tears.

""As I was about to go in bare feet, somebody shouted an order and they started to shoot.

""I saw her fall… and I saw the blood on the snow.""

As well as her mother, Hannah's grandfather, her uncle and her younger cousin Shlomo were also murdered at Adampol.

Now aged 85 and living in north London, Hannah is sharing her experience to mark Holocaust Memorial Day, the anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau.

Six million Jewish men, women and children were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust. In her family, only Hannah and her father survived.

'I never forgave myself for losing my cousin'

Hannah described her cousin Shlomo - who was deaf and unable to speak - as ""the brother I never had"" and ""the one person that I absolutely adored"".

She recalls being outside at the camp with the little boy, who was aged about three, when she heard the sound of Nazi vehicles pulling up.

""He couldn't hear and he couldn't speak so I took his hand,"" Hannah says. ""I pulled it so he knew he had to come and we ran in to the nearest barn.""

Hannah says she dived into a mound of straw where she and Shlomo would often hide but she realised he wasn't there.

She was about to leave her hiding place to find him when she saw her cousin standing by the barn door.

""The door swung open and (the Nazis) saw him and they picked him up literally by the scruff of his neck,"" she says.

""My last sight of my lovely cousin was his back… and his legs kicking. I never saw him again.

""When I lost Shlomo I never forgave myself.""

Image: Hannah pictured with her cousin Shlomo

Going into hiding

Hannah's family had been living in the small market town of Włodawa in Poland when the Nazis invaded.

""Suddenly there was a curfew,"" she says. ""And suddenly my grandfather couldn't trade. And suddenly you had to wear a mark.

""I remember my father, before it got really bad, putting me in a sled and taking me to a photographer.

""I'm standing there trying to smile and I've got tears in my eyes because I know that something horrible is happening and it's not right.

""I was probably six.""

The family initially went into hiding, staying in a barn which required a ""special knock"" to gain entry.

""There were two or three other families there and when they saw me, they were not best pleased,"" Hannah says.

""They did not want to hide with children.""

After one night there, Hannah says ""suddenly the barn door flew open"" and ""everybody froze"".

She recalls seeing ""the tip of very shiny boots"" and the peaked hats of Nazi soldiers as they ""poked around"".

""We sat there like statues,"" Hannah says.

'Luck ran out'

While the family narrowly avoided being found that time, Hannah says eventually their ""luck run out"" and they were given an hour to pack up their belongings.

Aged just six, Hannah says she walked for nearly five hours to the labour camp at Adampol.

""If you tripped, or if you fell, no one helped hold you up,"" she says.

""I remember them just shooting somebody.""

After arriving at the camp, there was no electricity or running water and the security measures included barbed wire fencing and a watchtower.

Then just a little girl, Hannah tried to cope with the trauma of witnessing her mother's death, and initially refused to believe she had been killed.

Instead, she convinced herself that Haya was injured and pretending to be dead to save herself.

It was only after being liberated by a Soviet soldier, and reunited with her father - who had also witnessed his wife's murder - that the reality dawned on Hannah.

""He got hold of me, he laughed, he cried, he cuddled me,"" she says of her father.

""I said: 'Where's mama?' He said: 'Mama's not coming back. Mama died. You saw it.'

""I remember him shaking me because apparently for a couple of hours I didn't utter one sound.""

Image: Hannah pictured with her father Adam

'Children ask: Do you hate the Germans?'

After the war, Hannah and her father lived in the Polish city of Lodz and she admits she became ""jealous"" of other children who had both parents.

She moved to Britain in 1949 to live with her great aunt and uncle, while her father left Poland for Israel in 1953.

She married in 1961 and has four children and eight grandchildren, and now shares her experience of the Holocaust in schools and universities.

""Every now and again the kids say: 'Do you tell your story because you hate the Germans?',"" she says.

""I say no, I tell my story because I care for you.

Mr Hunt will deliver an upbeat message in a keynote speech today, where he will say the government has a plan to use ""British genius and British hard work"" to boost economic growth and make the country ""the world's next Silicon Valley"".

He will go on to say the UK is ""poised to play a leading role in Europe and across the world in the growth sectors which will define this century"".

According to advance extracts from his speech released by the Treasury, he will also say ""declinism about Britain was wrong in the past and it is wrong today"".

Speaking at Bloomberg's European headquarters in London, Mr Hunt is also expected to continue to resist calls from some Tory MPs for tax cuts to kickstart flagging economic growth.

Instead he will say the UK should exploit the opportunities provided by the UK's withdrawal from the EU to raise productivity while using the proceeds of growth to support public services.

Mr Hunt will say that some of the ""gloom"" about the current economic outlook is based on statistics that ""do not reflect the whole picture"".

""Like every G7 country, our growth was slower in the years after the financial crisis than the years before it,"" he will say.

""But since 2010, the UK has grown faster than France, Japan and Italy. Since the Brexit referendum, we have grown at about the same rate as Germany.

""If we look further ahead, the case for declinism becomes weaker still. The UK is poised to play a leading role in Europe and across the world in the growth sectors which will define this century.""

Mr Hunt will also say: ""Our plan for the years that follow is long-term prosperity based on British genius and British hard work.

""(And) world-beating enterprises to make Britain the world's next Silicon Valley.""

The chancellor will add: ""It is a plan necessitated, energised and made possible by Brexit which will succeed if it becomes a catalyst for the bold choices we need to take.

""Our plan for growth is a plan built on the freedoms which Brexit provides. It is a plan to raise productivity.

""It is a plan to use the proceeds of growth to support our public services at home, to support businesses in the new low-carbon economy and to support democracy abroad.

""It is the right course for our country and the role in the world to which we aspire.""

Mr Hunt will also use his speech to announce that the government is to proceed with reforms to so-called ""Solvency II"" - an EU directive that governs the amount of funds British insurers are required to hold in reserve.

The Treasury pointed to an estimate by the Association of British Insurers which suggested the changes could unlock up to £100bn of private investment into UK infrastructure and clean energy - such as nuclear power - over the coming decade.

His address will come after a cabinet away day at Chequers yesterday, where Mr Hunt told ministers they must maintain their ""disciplined approach"" if they are to get inflation under control.

The chancellor is facing calls from some Tory MPs to cut taxes in his budget in March to inject growth into the economy.

But at Chequers, both he and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak emphasised the priority remained inflation which was only predicted to fall because of the ""tough decisions"" taken to stabilise the economy following former PM Liz Truss's catastrophic mini-budget tax giveaway.

""The chancellor said it would be necessary to retain this disciplined approach in order to reduce inflation, because it is the greatest driver of the cost of living,"" according to a No 10 readout of the meeting.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127033213/http://news.sky.com/story/chancellor-jeremy-hunt-set-to-declare-that-dire-predictions-about-uks-future-are-wrong-12796298

They met after she expressed her dismay last year that Mr Welby had reaffirmed the validity of a 1998 declaration by the church that gay sex was a sin.

The archbishop has recently said he welcomed the Church of England's proposals to bless same-sex married couples, but said he would not personally carry them out due to his ""pastoral relationship for the whole communion"".

""Yesterday I went to have coffee, tea, actually, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, not a sentence I thought would ever come out of my mouth,"" Toksvig said in her video.

""From our very calm and considered conversation yesterday, it is very clear that the State's Church of England and the society it purports to represent are not remotely in step.

""Justin was keen for me to see that they are moving forward, but conceded that any progress, as I would see it, if it happens at all, will be glacial.""

She said it was also ""very clear"" opposing factions of the worldwide Anglican Communion were being ""in part held together at the expense of the human rights of the LGBT+ community"".

She continued: ""I asked Justin if he could just come out. I don't mean to make a surprise announcement about his sexuality, but come out as a gay ally.

Hyejeong Shin, from New Brunswick in the state, has been charged with one count of providing a false government document with the intent to verify one's identity or age, NBC News reports.

Police said she showed a false birth certificate ""with the intent to enrol as a juvenile high school student"".

""Last week, by filing some false documents, an adult female posing as a student was able to be enrolled in our high school,"" New Brunswick Public School District Superintendent Aubrey Johnson said at a board of education meeting.

During her days in school, Shin spent a lot of time with guidance counsellors who were trying to find out more information about her, Mr Johnson added.

He said staff members at the school ""uncovered this woman's ruse and enabled us to address this situation promptly"".

""Once our staff determined it was dealing with fraudulent information, they immediately notified the appropriate authorities. The individual in question has now been charged,"" Mr Johnson said in a statement on Wednesday.

The school has warned students to refrain from having any further contact with the woman, in person and remotely, he added.

Mr Johnson said the district will take a look at its enrolment process to better identify false documentation.

""This is an unfortunate event. Communication has been provided to the parents of individuals that the young lady may have come into contact with, and communication has been provided to all high school parents today,"" Mr Johnson said.

Police have said schools are required to ""immediately enrol unaccompanied children, even in the absence of records normally required for enrolment"".

However, a district can request such documents later to verify a student's age.

Figures in a report from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and Local Data Company (LDC) showed the overall vacancy rate improving to 13.8%.

It marked a 0.1 percentage point improvement on the July-September period, the report showed.

The total was also 0.6 percentage points better than the same period last year and marked the fifth consecutive quarter of falling vacancy rates in the wake of the COVID pandemic.

Despite government support, a swathe of chains and independent stores closed amid the public health restrictions.

A shift towards online shopping and staying at home during the pandemic was soon followed by a surge in costs following the reopening, with stores and hospitality struggling to recruit staff at the same time.

Costs tied to the reopening were exacerbated by energy-led inflation which is still, industry says, claiming victims by the day as many struggle to pay their way at a time of depressed spending by consumers.

663;China's North Pole - where temperatures plunge to -53C and the air catches in your throat;Friday 27 January 2023 05:33, UK;['helen-ann smith', '@helenannsmith0'];['china'];['smoke', 'plunge', 'air', 'extreme', 'temperatures', 'throat', 'chinas', 'catches', 'weather', 'cant', '53c', 'country', 'cold', 'mohe', 'worlds', 'north', 'pole'];"Mohe is known as China's North Pole for a good reason. It is the country's most northern city and is a very, very cold place.

It's difficult to describe what temperatures this low feel like.

On Sunday, it hit -53C, a new record for the coldest temperature ever recorded in the country since modern monitoring began.

China's National Meteorological Centre confirmed it beat the previously long-held record of -52.3C, set all the way back in 1969.

It's so cold that the air catches in your throat, it feels uncomfortable in your lungs and you almost feel like you need to cough it out.

There is a strange freezing sensation around any part of your body where moisture lingers, you feel a kind of instant hardening around your eyelids and in your nostrils.

If your fingers are exposed, even if you're just wearing thinner gloves, they'll be totally numb in a matter of minutes - frostbite is a very real risk here.

Batteries on our devices drained abnormally quickly.

We had to ensure we only spent a short time outside at any one time and always had a warm vehicle to retreat to.

But there are fun bits too, a cup of boiling water thrown in the air freezes almost instantly and crashes to the ground as frozen gobbles of ice.

It's one of the reasons Chinese tourists flock here.

Mohe is located on the top tip of a slimmer section of China that protrudes right up into Russia - indeed, it's surrounded by Russia from the north, east and west and it is often exposed to harsh air travelling south from Siberia.

It's around 1,500 miles north of Beijing which is already considered pretty far north.

It's a picturesque, snow-covered place, home to about 85,000 residents who work in industries from farming to tourism.

While some residences are modern and well-equipped, others are old-fashioned, heated with small coal burners.

Local heating companies in Mohe have said the boilers are running at full power to help people through the winter and Beijing News reported that coal consumption has increased by a third in the city.

While extreme temperatures are not unusual here, they are around 15-20 degrees lower than the average. It raises now-familiar questions about the increased frequency of extreme weather events and what's causing it.

Part tourist town, part frontier outpost

An hour's drive even further north is the village of Beiji. It’s an odd place that you need to buy a ticket to enter, it feels like part tourist town, part frontier outpost.

Aside from its name literally translating to 'north pole', one of Beiji’s main attractions is the view over to its neighbour, because across a vast frozen river a fence lines the border, and beyond you can see the rocky hills of Russia.

Getting to Mohe is something of an undertaking.

You get a sense that you're going somewhere very bleak and very remote as soon as you board the sleeper train.

It's an old, rickety, characterful thing. The sleeping bunks are all open to the corridor - six people, stacked three on three in each little space.

Around the windows, the condensation forms a thick ice lining, hours before we reach our destination, outside the snow-drenched scenery is sublime.

Tourists are mixed with more hardened locals here - we were travelling during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday and it was packed.

This 15-hour train was just the last leg of the journey, we'd had to first fly two hours north from Beijing and then take a series of other trains to reach this one. It gives you a sense of just how remote and far north Mohe is.

'You can't fight against heaven'

It is often very, very cold here, so there is a degree to which the locals are hardened to it and expect it. They joke that tourists come here totally unprepared for what they find.

Mr Xie runs a small convenience store and gift shop literally overlooking the Russian border. Inside, among his wares for sale, is a small bed, a stove and a wood burner to keep him warm.

We asked him what it was like at -53C.

He said: ""There is smoke. You can't see anyone from a couple of meters away. Until noon, the smoke - we call it smoke but it’s actually really heavy fog - went away. Smoke appears whenever it gets cold.

""You can't fight against heaven. All we can do is to take whatever measures we can. As long as we are not cold, it's fine.""

But are you not worried, we asked.

""Worried, but not much we can do. Humans can't defeat natural disasters. Countries can't defeat natural disasters, let alone individuals. No method,"" he added.

A cold spell from Siberia

This cold spell is being caused by an area of very cold low-pressure air moving south from Siberia. The land there is so far from the warming effects of the sea and gets so little sunshine that the conditions are perfect for the creation of extra cold air.

Normally the circulation of this air is limited by local wind patterns, but 'weakness' in the system can cause the freezing air to break out as it did during the 'Beast from the East' across the British Isles in 2018.

But even up in Russian Siberia, they have been experiencing more frequently aggressive cold spells.

Let's be clear, it is always pretty cold up here. But temperatures this week have been, on average 15-20 degrees Celsius colder than normal.

The role of climate change

While you can't attribute any individual event directly to climate change without further research, it is certainly true that this part of the world is now experiencing more extreme weather events more frequently.

Research suggests that climate change can be responsible for excessively cold spells.

For instance, scientists think that warming seas in the arctic areas north of Russia can have a destabilising effect on the air in the stratosphere, which is the body of air between 10km and 50km above the world's surface.

This, they say, can cause excessive cold spells in more low-lying areas.

China's weather extremes

The weather in China has been a story of historic extremes in the last six to eight months.

In the summer, the country was hit by record periods of heat and drought that authorities described as the ""most severe"" since records began in terms of duration, intensity, and impact.

It was, in fact, the hottest summer and autumn in 60 years, with multiple cities breaking records. The average rainfall fell by 23% and the country suffered serious forest fires, damaged crops and reduced power supplies.

Swaths of the Great Yangtze River dried up, affecting industries from hydropower to shipping.

China, although one of the world's leading investors in clean energy, still relies on an extensive coal mining industry and is a major contributor to the world's greenhouse gas emissions.

While many Chinese people are just getting on with their lives, others, particularly those who have experienced these extreme weather events, say they have noticed changes and are concerned about them.

This is a country of 1.4 billion people with an incredibly vast range of topographies and climates.

Big ranges in weather are expected and normal here, but such historic extremes in such quick succession are, as some say, concerning.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127054814/http://news.sky.com/story/chinas-north-pole-where-temperatures-plunge-to-53c-and-the-air-catches-in-your-throat-12796062

Throughout the Ukraine war, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been calling on the West for help in punishing Russia.

However, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said he will veto any potential EU sanctions affecting nuclear energy.

While the 27-nation EU has largely favoured the request, Hungary has so far blocked every attempt.

A senior EU official said Russia has taken its war against Ukraine to ""a different stage"" by making indiscriminate attacks on civilians and non-military targets.

Stefano Sannino, secretary general of the European Union's European External Action Service, defended German and US provisions of the military equipment to Ukraine, and criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin for waging ""a war against NATO and the West"".

Speaking at a news conference in Tokyo, Mr Sannino said German and US tank provisions are meant to help Ukrainians defend themselves in the war, rather than making them attackers.

""I think that this latest development in terms of armed supply is just an evolution of the situation and of the way Russia started moving the war into a different stage,"" he said.

The EU is not moving the war into a different stage but is ""just giving the possibility of saving lives and allowing the Ukrainians to defend (themselves) from these barbaric attacks"", he added.

On Wednesday, Germany and the US announced they will send advanced battle tanks to Ukraine, offering what one expert called an ""armoured punching force"" to help Kyiv break combat stalemates as the Russian invasion enters its 12th month.

The announcement marked the first stage of a co-ordinated effort by the West to provide dozens of the heavy weapons, which Ukrainian military commanders said would enable counter-offensives, reduce casualties and help restore dwindling ammunition supplies.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127080206/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russian-probing-attacks-on-ukrainian-towns-powerful-blasts-near-europes-biggest-nuclear-power-plant-12541713

Matt Hancock's earnings from his 18-day appearance on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! have also been revealed.

Mr Johnson's latest update to the MPs register of interests shows he received £510,000 as an advance on his upcoming book.

He also earned £200,892.86 for a speech to Aditya Birla Management, an Indian conglomerate, and £246,406.57 from Bloomberg Singapore for a speech he made in the city.

The former prime minister earned £3,000 for an article he wrote for The Spectator magazine, which he said took an hour to write.

His total earnings from 14 December to 13 January were £960,298.

The income is on top of his salary of £84,144 for being an MP and an additional £79,936 for when he was prime minister.

Mr Johnson has now made £2,328,964 in extra earnings since the start of this parliament in December 2019.

He made more than £1m of that in the three months from September to mid-December after he handed over his premiership to Liz Truss.

Soaring inflation means plans for the high-speed rail project to run to central London may be scrapped completely, with trains instead stopping at a new hub at Old Oak Common in the suburbs of west London, The Sun reports.

Commuters would have to finish their journeys into the city centre by using the Elizabeth Line.

Image: Clearance work took place for a new London Euston site in 2019

A two to five-year delay to the entire project, at present due to be completed between 2029 and 2033, is being considered, according to the newspaper.

Asked about the report, the Department for Transport said: ""The government remains committed to delivering HS2 to Manchester, as confirmed in the autumn statement.

""As well as supporting tens of thousands of jobs, the project will connect regions across the UK, improve capacity on our railways and provide a greener option of travel.""

HS2's website still features plans for the trains to travel to Euston and says a new station there will have 10 450m platforms.

It adds that the station will be used by up to 17 high-speed trains per hour at ""peak operation"".

The HS2 project has been dogged by criticism over its financial and environmental impact.

In October 2021 Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, suggested capital investment for HS2 would be reviewed but Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, subsequently backed the project.

The target cost of Phase 1 between London and Birmingham was £40.3bn at 2019 prices.

A budget of £55.7bn for the whole of HS2 was set in 2015.

Penny Gaines, of the campaign group Stop HS2, said it is ""not at all surprising"" that costs are spiralling out of control.

She added: ""These reports just show that there are so many problems with HS2. It's being delayed further and further so the cost is going up, it should be cancelled in its entirety as soon as possible.

""Stop spending money building a railway people don't need. Use the money to restore the countryside and the areas that are being devastated by HS2 and look at the solutions that people need in the 21st century.

The operation carried out on Wednesday targeted Bilal al-Sudani, who is thought to have played a key role in bankrolling the terror group's activities in Africa and Afghanistan, as well as leading the organisation in Somalia.

US President Joe Biden was briefed last week about the Somalia mission, which followed months of planning, and gave the go-ahead this week.

Intelligence officials have had al-Sudani on their radar for years.

US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said: ""This action leaves the United States and its partners safer and more secure, and it reflects our steadfast commitment to protecting Americans from the threat of terrorism at home and abroad.""

US Africa Command said in a statement: ""Given the remote location of the operation, the assessment is that no civilians were injured or killed.

""Protecting civilians remains a vital part of the command's operations to promote greater security for all Africans.""

One American involved in the operation was bitten by a dog, but was not seriously injured, according to an administration official.

US officials provided few details about how the mission was carried out or the circumstances of al-Sudani's killing.

One official said that US forces had intended to capture him but that did not prove to be ""feasible"" as the operation unfolded.

Police in Leawood, Kansas, are investigating after receiving reports at around 3.40am on Wednesday that a truck, driving westbound on Interstate 435 (I-435), was dragging a silver Kia under the edge of its trailer, according to NBC.

A video captured the scene as several other cars attempted to flash their lights to alert the truck driver.

After around eight miles, he finally pulled over.

The woman driving the Kia, who is from Kansas City, was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been released.

Police audio, published by local newspaper The Kansas City Star, revealed individuals told dispatchers that they ""think someone is inside the vehicle that's stuck underneath the truck"", after two officers were sent to the ""unknown accident"".

Captain Brad Robbins reportedly told local media he believed the truck was passing through a green light, when the Kia, travelling southbound, skidded through a red light hitting the rear wheels of the trailer.

Fire and ambulance crews also responded and were initially unable to find a pulse on the driver, according to The Star. When she regained consciousness she complained that she was in a lot of pain.

Speaking at Bloomberg's European headquarters in London, he will attack ""declinism"", instead saying the country is ""poised to play a leading role in Europe and across the world in the growth sectors which will define this century"".

But his speech will come against the backdrop of a cost of living crisis, ongoing strikes over pay, and demands from some of his party to focus on tax cuts to boost the economy.

Chancellor's speech as it happens - politics latest

Mr Hunt took over the Treasury under the turmoil of Liz Truss' government, which saw her and her first chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, announce a raft of unfunded tax cuts, which saw the markets react badly.

As a result, his first speeches from Number 11 focused on the dire situation the country was left in, telling the public it was ""likely to get worse before it gets better"".

But it appears the chancellor will now seek to echo some of the former prime minister's optimistic language around growth that proved so popular with Conservative Party members, saying the government has a plan for ""long-term prosperity based on British genius and British hard work"".

Mr Hunt will say: ""Declinism about Britain was wrong in the past - and it is wrong today. Some of the gloom is based on statistics that do not reflect the whole picture.

""Like every G7 country, our growth was slower in the years after the financial crisis than the years before it. But since 2010, the UK has grown faster than France, Japan and Italy. Since the Brexit referendum, we have grown at about the same rate as Germany.

""If we look further ahead, the case for declinism becomes weaker still. The UK is poised to play a leading role in Europe and across the world in the growth sectors which will define this century.""

Sky News' business presenter, Ian King, warned the comparisons had been ""very, very carefully selected… to paint the UK in a positive light"". He added: ""Probably more pertinent is the fact that the UK economy is the only one in the G7… whose economy remains smaller than it was going into the pandemic.""

While Labour's Andrew Gwynne said people were not ""talking down the country"", but the Tory government was ""running down the country"".

He told Sky News: ""We've had 13 years of the same messaging. Tory chancellor, after Tory chancellor has talked about the need for growth, the need for productivity, the need for investment over the long term, the need for infrastructure, the need for levelling up.

""If I had a pound for every time a Tory chancellor spoke about all these things, I could pay Nadhim Zahawi's tax bill.

""The proof of the pudding is in the eating and we don't need the same old tired message. What we need is a real plan for growth.""

Inflation priority

The speech comes two months ahead of his first full budget, and a number of Tory MPs are pushing for him to introduce tax cuts to bring down the historically high tax burden under the premiership of Rishi Sunak.

Former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith told the Daily Express: ""The government must make it very clear that we believe in lowering the tax, lowering costs, giving people greater choice.

""That always seems to me to be a positive message to send - rather than saying simply you can't do tax cuts, that's a negative.""

But Mr Hunt is expected to resist such calls, with both him and Mr Sunak sticking to their guns that lowering record inflation is the key priority.

A readout from the cabinet's awayday at Chequers yesterday said he told his colleagues ""it would be necessary to retain this disciplined approach in order to reduce inflation, because it is the greatest driver of the cost of living"".

Instead, the chancellor will talk about exploiting what he claims are the opportunities of Brexit in order to kickstart the economy.

""Confidence in the future starts with honesty about the present, and we should not shy away from the biggest challenge we face which is our poor productivity,"" he will say. ""Our plan for long term prosperity tackles that challenge head on.

""It is a plan necessitated, energised and made possible by Brexit which will succeed if it becomes a catalyst for the bold choices we need to take.

""Our plan for growth is a plan built on the freedoms which Brexit provides. It is a plan to raise productivity. It is a plan to use the proceeds of growth to support our public services at home, to support businesses in the new low carbon economy and to support democracy abroad.

""It is the right course for our country and the role in the world to which we aspire.""

However, many experts believe Brexit has contributed to the UK's struggling economy due to increased trade barriers with the EU.

Mr Hunt will also use his speech to announce that the government is to proceed with reforms to so-called ""Solvency II"" - an EU directive that governs the amount of funds British insurers are required to hold in reserve.

The Treasury pointed to an estimate by the Association of British Insurers which suggested the changes could unlock up to £100bn of private investment into UK infrastructure and clean energy - such as nuclear power - over the coming decade.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127090231/http://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-hunt-to-dismiss-economic-gloom-as-pressure-builds-from-tories-over-tax-cuts-12796298

The ancient man's well-preserved sarcophagus has been discovered after a year-long excavation just outside of the capital Cairo. It is just one of dozens of new archaeological discoveries found in Egypt.

Researchers believe it belonged to a man named Hekashepes and that his remains are around 4,300 years old.

The mummy was found at the bottom of a 15m (50ft) shaft near what is considered Egypt's first pyramid structure, the Step Pyramid at Saqqara.

Zahi Hawass, director of the excavation team, said: ""I put my head inside to see what was inside the sarcophagus: A beautiful mummy of a man completely covered in layers of gold.""

The team told reporters the mummy dates back to the fifth and sixth dynasties of the Old Kingdom, which spanned from roughly 2,500 BC to 2,100 BC.

Another of the uncovered tombs belonged to a priest known as Khnumdjedef. He served under Unas, the last king of ancient Egypt's fifth dynasty. The inside of the tomb was decorated with scenes of daily life.

The other belonged to an official named Meri, who held the title ""keeper of the secrets and assistant to the great leader of the palace,"" the team said.

While the wreck sank in 1672 and was discovered in 2019 off the coast of Sussex, until now it was known as the ""Unknown Wreck off Eastbourne"".

However, scientists have now identified the wreck as the Dutch warship Klein Hollandia.

Built in 1656 and owned by the Admiralty of Rotterdam, the ship was involved in all major battles in the second Anglo-Dutch war from 1665 to 1667.

Over the past year, specialists from Historic England, the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands and the Nautical Archaeology Society have been working on identifying the ship.

They used evidence gathered from the wreck, as well as archival research and tree ring analysis of the wood samples.

Experts say the wreck's condition is remarkable and could offer a wealth of information about how 17th-century Dutch ships were built and the activities of the warship during its final voyage.

Heritage minister Lord Parkinson said the identification ""offers a glimpse back into the 17th century, giving us a chance to learn more about the maritime history of this period and to uncover treasures which have been underwater for hundreds of years"".

Upon its discovery, the wreck was considered so important that it was granted the highest level of protection in the same year, under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973.

A large part of the wooden hull, cannons, Italian marble tiles and pieces of Italian pottery were among the material found on the seabed.

The marble tiles came from the Apuan Alps quarries close to Carrara in Italy.

The tiles were bound for the Netherlands and would have been used to build high-status homes.

The wreck was discovered by Eastbourne dive operator David Ronnan and reported to Historic England. Mr Ronnan and Mark Beattie-Edwards are the licensees and have been investigating the wreck.

With freezing temperatures and soaring heating bills, the cost of living crisis has seen a huge rise in electric blanket sales - but some are made so poorly they risk giving the user an electric shock, according to one consumer champion.

Customers looking to save money by buying cheaper versions online could be putting themselves at risk.

Which? tests have found electric blankets being sold on online marketplaces that cannot be legally sold in the UK and pose a serious threat to customer safety.

Nine out of the 11 electric blankets, throws and shawls Which? bought from third-party sellers on AliExpress, Amazon, eBay and Wish should not be sold legally in the UK because they are so badly made or have problems with the packaging, markings or instructions.

Only two electric blankets out of 11 passed all of Which?’s tests - one from Amazon and one from eBay.

Eight of the 11 were poorly made with three posing a potential electric shock hazard; all three of these were bought on AliExpress.

One electric blanket, bought on AliExpress for £13, had wires connecting the controller to the mains which were simply twisted together and covered in sealant, which served to hide a second-rate connection.

The plug provided was the European two-pin variety and it came with a cheap UK adapter with pins much too close to the edge of the plug, which presents an electric shock risk.

Eight of the 11 electric blankets Which? tested were poorly made, with many standard safety warnings missing and in some cases, half of the instructions were not given in English.

In addition to safety concerns, some of the products were incredibly inefficient. For example, in the cases of a Cenlang heated shawl, £12.99 on AliExpress, and an electric heated blanket poncho on eBay, £15.99, only 5% of the total surface area of the respective products were heated, the size of a sheet of A5 paper.

The nine dodgy electric blankets flagged by Which? have now been removed by the online marketplaces.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127101732/https://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-electric-blanket-warning-over-shock-risk-jeremy-hunt-signals-tough-decisions-ahead-12615118

Although Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's speech was filled with optimism for the UK economy, not everyone shares his high hopes.

Anaam Raza, of investment platform Saxo, pointed out that the pound fell against the dollar this morning, from £1.241 to £1.236.

""The chancellor explained his blueprint to prosperity, however, with the UK dealing with double digit inflation, lower levels of business investment across the UK and interest rates expected to rise again early next month, he has his work cut out,"" he said.



Mr Raza said while the chancellor's vision was ""great for headlines"", business activity is contracting at its fastest pace in two years due to the high cost of living, there is reduced business investment and a ""rising chance"" of the country falling into recession.

""This pipe dream could be a long way away,"" he said.

683;Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust fined for 'catalogue of failings and errors' over death of Wynter Andrews who died 23 minutes after birth;Friday 27 January 2023 11:08, UK;[];['nhs'];['failings', 'trust', 'nottingham', 'mrs', 'failing', 'harm', 'wynter', 'staff', 'fined', 'risk', 'died', 'minutes', 'university', 'care', 'andrews', 'errors', 'hospitals', 'nhs'];"An NHS trust has been fined £800,000 for failing to provide safe care and treatment to a baby who died 23 minutes after she was born.

Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust put Wynter Andrews and her mother Sarah at ""significant risk of avoidable harm"" in 2019, prosecutors said.

An earlier inquest ruled that Wynter died due to a loss of oxygen to the brain, which could have been prevented by staff at Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) in Nottingham.

Image: Sarah and Gary Andrews arrive at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Friday morning

Prosecutors told Nottingham Magistrates' Court the trust put the mother and daughter at risk of harm by being understaffed and failing to ensure staff at the centre were aware of its guidelines.

The trust admitted two counts of failing to provide safe care and treatment resulting in harm and loss.

Sentencing on Friday, district judge Grace Leong said: ""The catalogue of failings and errors exposed Mrs Andrews and her baby to a significant risk of harm which was avoidable, and such errors ultimately resulted in the death of Wynter and post-traumatic stress for Mrs Andrews and Mr Andrews.

""My assessment is that the level of culpability is high, where offences on Wynter and Mrs Andrews are concerned.

""There were systems in place, but there were so many procedures and practices where guidance was not followed or adhered to or implemented.""

District Judge Leong added the ""systematic failures"" were ""more than sufficient"" to cause harm to Wynter and her mother.

However, she said she was ""acutely aware"" that any fine would have to be paid out of public funds which would otherwise be spent on patient care.

Mrs Andrews said she was ""failed in the most cruel way"" by the trust and that its management was ""repeatedly warned by staff about safety at the unit"" but ""failed to act"".

The Care Quality Commission (CQC), which inspects health services in England, said last July that it would prosecute the trust.

The maternity unit at the QMC was rated as inadequate by the CQC, with the hospital overall rated as requiring improvement, when it was inspected last March.

Mrs Andrews was admitted to hospital on 14 September 2019, her planned due date, after an ""uncomplicated"" pregnancy.

An induced labour planned for 7 September was cancelled on her request, but an investigation later found this was signed off by a midwife without consulting an obstetrician, and limited reasoning was given for the decision in medical notes.

Demonstrators also attacked the official residence of the prime minister, Ariel Henry, in Port-au-Prince before heading to the airport as he arrived back from a trip to Argentina, trapping him for a time.

The violence flared in Haiti after at least 10 officers were murdered in the last week by gangs.

A video has been circulated showing the naked and bloodied bodies of six of the victims, with their guns lying on their chests.

The gang who killed them, known as Gan Grif, still has their remains, according to police.

The murders are the latest example of escalating violence in the Caribbean nation, which has been gripped by gang wars and political chaos following the 2021 assassination of president Jovenel Moise.

His unelected successor has called on the United Nations to lead a military intervention, but no country has been willing to send troops.

The deaths have fuelled unrest among both serving and former police officers, who are demanding better protection and a crackdown on the gangs.

They have also called for the government to be ousted, which many Haitians view as illegitimate.

One protester said: ""If they are killing police officers, me as a citizen, what should I do?

""The police are second only to God and we're going to stand behind them.""

The UN estimates 60% of Port-au-Prince is controlled by gangs, but on the streets of the capital, Haitians argue it is more like 100%.

This week, the UN special envoy for Haiti urged the US and Canadian governments to lead an international armed force to help Haiti combat the gangs.

The police, meanwhile, have appealed for more resources.

Daniel Harris used an online platform called World Truth Videos to disseminate a ""call to arms"" for his violent racist beliefs, a court heard.

The 19-year-old from Glossop in Derbyshire was convicted of five counts of encouraging terrorism and one of possessing a 3D printer for the purposes of terrorism after a trial at Manchester Crown Court.

He was sentenced to 11-and-a-half years in jail, and a further 3 years on licence.

Prosecutors said US mass killer Payton Gendron was ""encouraged and, in part, motivated to do what he did"" by Harris.

Gendron murdered 10 black people in a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, in May 2022 while livestreaming the attack. Within hours, Harris produced a video celebrating the killing spree.

Gendron, 19, had left a comment on one of Harris's videos two months before the mass shooting, saying: ""You are not alone my friend :)"".

Image: Payton Gendron murdered 10 people in a mass shooting in New York

The video included lessons to be learned from Brenton Tarrant, who livestreamed an attack in which he killed 51 people at mosques in New Zealand in March 2019.

Gendron had also taken an image from another of Harris's videos and used it as the main image on his ""manifesto"".

Prosecutor Joe Allman said Gendron was ""inspired"" by Harris's material.

The British teenager also influenced Anderson Lee Aldrich, the only suspect in a shooting at a gay bar in Colorado, the court was told.

Aldrich, 22, allegedly killed five people during an indiscriminate firearms attack in Colorado Springs, in November last year - while Harris was on trial in the UK.

Aldrich - who is yet to enter pleas over the Colorado shooting - ""accessed material"" produced by Harris, Mr Allman said.

The prosecutor told the court one of Harris's videos was posted on the ""brother site"" to a website with links to what appeared to be a livestream of Aldrich preparing to carry out the attacks.

Mr Allman said: ""The Crown say it demonstrates that individuals of the greatest concern have accessed the material produced by Mr Harris.""

Harris was described in court as an ""influential online propagandist for a violent and deeply racist ideology"".

His videos glorified mass killings and were ""tantamount to a call to arms to those who shared, or who could be persuaded to share Mr Harris's world view,"" Mr Allman said.

Under the pseudonym ""BookAnon"", Harris's videos ""encouraged and gave instructions for carrying out acts of terror against those deemed not to be part of the white European race,"" the court heard.

One video showed how to make an assault rifle using a 3D printer and when police raided Harris's grandfather's house, they found that he had begun making the parts himself.

'Toxic rhetoric with untold influence'

After the teenager's conviction, Detective Inspector Chris Brett said attempts were initially made to engage with Harris through the Prevent programme, which aims to stop people becoming terrorists.

""It soon became clear he was pretending to be deradicalised whilst encouraging terrorism online,"" Mr Brett added.

""The threat he caused meant we had to act in order to ensure the safety of the wider public.""

Mr Brett said Harris ""clearly demonstrated a disdain for law enforcement and public order, as well as an admiration for those who had committed atrocities in terrorist attacks overseas"".

""By posting these videos online, Harris' toxic rhetoric could have had untold influence on countless people across the world - such actions will not be tolerated,"" the senior officer said.

He added that officers made ""the rather chilling discovery of attempts to make component parts of a firearm printed from his 3D printer"" during a search, which ""showed a clear intent to create a deadly weapon"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127113235/http://news.sky.com/story/daniel-harris-british-teenage-extremist-whose-videos-were-linked-to-two-mass-murders-in-us-jailed-12795052

About 40,000 people were expected to attend the evening concert at Mt Smart Stadium in New Zealand's largest city.

Thousands were already at the venue when organisers decided to cancel shortly before the rock legend was due to take the stage.

Billed as being part of Elton John's final farewell tour, promoter Frontier Touring tweeted the concert had been cancelled due to unsafe weather conditions.

""After the gig was called off, hundreds of people queued in the downpours for the shuttle buses and I saw some people chant for Elton in the hope he'd come on - but it was like a literal river there.""

Weather agency MetService warned of flash flooding and hazardous driving conditions throughout the city.

Tyre Nichols, 29, died in hospital three days after the confrontation in the city of Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

Bodycam footage of the altercation is expected to be released on Friday evening.

A lawyer for the Nichols' family who has seen the footage said he was used as ""a human pinata"".

Joe Biden, the president, called for any protests to be peaceful after the charges on Thursday.

Nichols, a father of one, was arrested after he was stopped for reckless driving, police said, before he was allegedly beaten by the officers for three minutes.

The five black officers involved in the arrest were sacked after a police investigation found they used excessive force or failed to intervene and help him.

They are Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills Jr and Justin Smith, who are between 24 and 32.

Cerelyn Davis, the Memphis police chief, has asked for calm when the video footage is made public.

""I expect you to feel what the Nichols family feels,"" she said. ""I expect you to feel outrage in the disregard of basic human rights.""

David Rausch, the director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, said he was sickened by what he saw in the police body-worn camera videos.

""What happened here does not at all reflect proper policing,"" he said. ""This was wrong. This was criminal.""

Steve Mulroy, the district attorney, said the five officers have been charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping and official misconduct at a news conference on Thursday.

He said that after Mr Nichols was stopped in his car, there was ""an altercation"" and officers used pepper spray on him.

Mr Nichols fled on foot.

""There was another altercation at a nearby location at which the serious injuries were experienced by Mr Nichols,"" Mr Mulroy said.

The Memphis police department said in an initial statement that an ambulance was called because Mr Nichols ""complained of having a shortness of breath"" and that he was taken to hospital in critical condition.

Mr Mulroy said he would not comment on the legality of the initial traffic stop.

He said the investigation would continue and he would not rule out additional charges.

Second-degree murder will go a considerable distance in meeting public expectations James Matthews US correspondent @jamesmatthewsky America has been here before. A black man dead at the hands of police officers, with the brutality captured on camera. Rodney King and George Floyd are just two names that define a deadly dysfunction in the institution that exists to protect and serve. Now add Tyre Nichols - 29 years old, a father and family man who worked at FedEx and enjoyed skateboarding. ""Nobody's perfect,"" said his mother RowVaugn, ""But he was damn near"". We are told the events leading up to his death are contained in a video lasting an hour, multiple angles of what has been trailed as a savage assault. A lawyer for the Nichols family spoke of him being beaten ""like a human pinata"". The Friday night release of the footage is shrouded by a sense of dread, given its potential to ignite violent street protest of the sort seen in the wake of the 2020 killing of George Floyd. In Memphis, they are aware of the danger. It explains why the build-up to the release of the footage has been choreographed around charges for the police officers involved. In a place where the public demands accountability, laying charges of second-degree murder will go a considerable distance towards meeting expectations. Charges of murder in the second degree accuse the officers of knowingly killing Mr Nichols. Does it make a difference that the five men in uniform were black? Perhaps. Time will tell if, and how, that plays into the wider public response. President Biden framed it thus: ""Tyre's death is a painful reminder that we must do more to ensure that our criminal justice system lives up to the promise of fair and impartial justice, equal treatment and dignity for all. ""We also cannot ignore the fact that fatal encounters with law enforcement have disparately impacted black and brown people."" It is a matter of power and its abuse. The latest episode will soon be laid bare - and Memphis is braced.

President Biden said: ""Outrage is understandable, but violence is never acceptable.

""Tyre's death is a painful reminder that we must do more to ensure that our criminal justice system lives up to the promise of fair and impartial justice, equal treatment and dignity for all.""

The Nichols family watched the police footage on Monday with their lawyer, Ben Crump, who compared the beating to the 1991 assault by police on Rodney King in Los Angeles that was captured on video and prompted mass protests and police reforms.

""He was defenceless the entire time. He was a human pinata for those police officers,"" Antonio Romanucci, Mr Crump's co-counsel, told reporters.

Mr Crump said Nichols' last words heard on the video were of him calling for his mother three times.

Each of the five sacked officers had served in the department for between two and a half and five years, and were dismissed from the force last Saturday.

The officers could not be reached for comment.

692;Wynter Andrews: Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust fined £800,000 over baby's death 23 minutes after birth;Friday 27 January 2023 11:32, UK;[];['nhs'];['trust', 'nottingham', 'mrs', 'harm', 'wynter', 'rated', 'fined', 'death', 'planned', 'minutes', 'unit', 'university', 'sarah', 'birth', 'andrews', 'errors', 'hospitals', 'nhs'];"An NHS trust has been fined £800,000 for a ""catalogue of failings and errors"" that led to the death of a baby 23 minutes after she was born.

Wynter Andrews died in the arms of her parents, Sarah and Gary Andrews, on 15 September 2019 due to a lack of oxygen to the brain, shortly after an emergency Caesarean section.

Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust had admitted two counts of failing to provide safe care and treatment resulting in harm and loss at an earlier hearing.

Sentencing at the city's magistrates' court on Friday, district judge Grace Leong said: ""The catalogue of failings and errors exposed Mrs Andrews and her baby to a significant risk of harm which was avoidable, and such errors ultimately resulted in the death of Wynter and post-traumatic stress for Mrs Andrews and Mr Andrews.

""My assessment is that the level of culpability is high, where offences on Wynter and Mrs Andrews are concerned.

""There were systems in place, but there were so many procedures and practices where guidance was not followed or adhered to or implemented.""

District Judge Leong added the ""systematic failures"" were ""more than sufficient"" to cause harm to Wynter and her mother.

However, she said she was ""acutely aware"" that any fine would have to be paid out of public funds which would otherwise be spent on patient care.

Mrs Andrews said she was ""failed in the most cruel way"" by the trust and that its management was ""repeatedly warned by staff about safety at the unit"" but ""failed to act"".

The Care Quality Commission (CQC), which inspects health services in England, said last July that it would prosecute the trust.

The maternity unit at the QMC was rated as inadequate by the CQC, with the hospital overall rated as requiring improvement, when it was inspected last March.

Mrs Andrews was admitted to hospital on 14 September 2019, her planned due date, after an ""uncomplicated"" pregnancy.

An induced labour planned for 7 September was cancelled on her request, but an investigation later found this was signed off by a midwife without consulting an obstetrician, and limited reasoning was given for the decision in medical notes.

Baby deaths mystery from 1930s solved

Once Mrs Andrews was in labour, Wynter's heartbeat was described as ""suspicious"" by doctors, who decided to deliver her via caesarean section.

693;Baby deaths: Why do maternity scandals keep happening?;Wednesday 19 October 2022 20:46, UK;['becky johnson', '@beckyjohnsonsky'];['nhs'];['maternity', 'trust', 'hawkins', 'nhs', 'babies', 'telford', 'caesarean', 'deaths', 'think', 'happening', 'care', 'scandals', 'told', 'baby'];"In the autumn sunshine, a young couple walk hand-in-hand through a graveyard in Ludlow. They come here every week, to visit the quiet corner where their daughter is buried.

Mia Harwood should now be nearly seven months old. But the outfits they bought for her are kept in a memory box, alongside prints of the tiny hands they can't hold.

Mia was stillborn on 3 April. Her mother, Hazel, was admitted to the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford the day after the Ockenden Review was published.

It was a damning report that blamed the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust for the deaths of more than 200 babies.

It revealed a trust that failed to learn from mistakes, failed to properly monitor babies during labour and, in some cases, failed to perform caesarean sections that could have saved lives.

Staff told the review that the trust was very proud of its low caesarean rate, which was well below the national average.

From the moment she was admitted, Hazel was worried because tests had suggested she could have pre-eclampsia, a condition that can be dangerous and mean the baby should be delivered early.

During the final weeks of her pregnancy, she had repeatedly asked if she should have a caesarean section.

""With a first child you don't know any different, so you think if they're telling you this is safe then carry on. But every day I was asking if a C-section was safer,"" she said.

Staff took the decision to induce her labour soon after her due date.

""I asked if it was safer just to get her out. They just kept saying we'll carry on with the induction and see what happens.""

But after they had begun to induce her labour, she was told there would be a delay.

""They told us all the inductions had to be paused because the labour ward was full,"" she said.

By the following evening there were concerns.

""I was sent up for a scan and they told me that she'd gone, there was no blood flow. They couldn't hear anything or see anything.""

Her husband Sam arrived and Hazel continued to deliver Mia, who by then had passed away.

Midwife told Mia's parents 'sometimes it's just you'

Their grief was then compounded by a midwife who spoke to them about what would happen next.

""They said oh, you know, she's gone for a post-mortem and we'll get some answers and she said 'sometimes they don't find anything, sometimes it's just you',"" Hazel recalled.

""To have your daughter die and then a day later someone essentially blame you, that was just the worst thing you can say to anyone.""

The director of nursing at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust has offered ""heartfelt condolences"" to Mrs Harwood and her family, adding that ""we know that during times of distress, communication and the use of language are key"".

""No individual should ever be left feeling that they are to blame.""

Investigations are ongoing into the cause of Mia's death and Hazel is still awaiting the results of the post-mortem examination.

She believes her case raises questions about what was going on in a hospital where failings had been so publicly highlighted and promises had been made to improve.

""I understand that there are staffing issues throughout the NHS,"" she says.

""But if you cannot look after your patients safely and listen to them, then should you really be continuing to offer the services?

""I think they should stop trying to delay C-sections because it's not safe.""

Sky News has obtained an NHS document from 2010, entitled 'Pathways to Success: a self-improvement toolkit. Focus on normal birth and reducing Caesarean rates'.

The document, which is over 100 pages long, details the ways in which hospitals can ""assess their current practice in promoting normal birth"".

It states: ""There was a general belief amongst clinicians involved in this project that maternity units applying best practise to the management of pregnancy, labour and birth will achieve a CS rate consistently below 20% and will have aspirations to reduce that rate to 15%.""

Benefits listed of reducing rates included ""a sense of pride in units"" and ""opportunity for financial savings"".

Among the 27 trusts thanked for their contributions to the document were East Kent, Shrewsbury and Telford and Nottingham University Hospitals.

Parents of Harriet Hawkins: 'Complete culture needs to change'

Harriet Hawkins was stillborn in hospital in Nottingham in 2016. Her parents, Jack and Sarah, both worked at the trust at the time.

Mr Hawkins, who left his job as a consultant in acute medicine while fighting a legal battle with the trust over the death of his daughter, says he believes there needs to be a fundamental change in maternity care across the country.

""There isn't another branch of medicine that I can think of as a doctor where there are two teams of people trying to do exactly the same thing, but they have completely different ways of doing it and completely different backgrounds of how they're trained and that is frightening,"" he said.

""Midwives offered us aromatherapy when we had an obstetric emergency. They should have called the obstetricians to come and do an emergency caesarean section.

""I feel like the complete culture needs to change,"" he added.

""And I think the decision that needs to be made is are we going to tolerate further harm to babies and mothers and dead babies and mothers in this country?

""In the name of all sorts of nonsensical desire of various professional people, or are we going to say that's it? We don't anymore. No more. That means teams working together. It means people being held to account.""

Donna Ockenden, the independent midwife who investigated the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust, is now carrying out an inquiry into maternity services in Nottingham.

More than 700 families have already contacted the review team.

A spokesperson for Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust said they welcome the independent review, adding: ""We are truly sorry we failed Mr and Mrs Hawkins and baby Harriet in the care delivered in 2016, and are doing everything in our power to ensure patients using our maternity services receive the best care possible.""

Earlier this year, NHS England told hospitals to stop using targets for caesarean section rates due to concerns about patient safety.

The Department for Health and Social Care says the document we obtained ""is not representative of current government policy"".

Charity 'receives over 1,000 calls a year over maternity care concerns'

But the charity Birthrights says it receives over 1,000 calls a year from women and healthcare professionals concerned about maternity care at trusts not confined to those already highlighted as having unusually high numbers of deaths.

Francesca Treadaway from the charity said: ""We cover the entire UK and we're receiving inquiries along these same lines from all over the country.

""It's the breadth and complexity of the inquiries that's growing along with the number of inquiries that we're receiving.""

The most viewed page on their website remains a factsheet on the rights of women to have a ""maternal request caesarean section"".

Since April, they've answered inquiries relating to caesarean sections at 30 trusts and health boards.

Midwives known as 'the musketeers' pursued natural birth 'at any cost'

University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust admitted negligence after Toby Feasey was stillborn in 2017.

Staff at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary had failed to diagnose that his mother Jenny had pre-eclampsia.

The same trust had been found responsible for the deaths of 11 babies and one mother in a report two years earlier that found there was a ""lethal mix"" of failings in maternity care at Furness General hospital.

A group of midwives who were known as the ""musketeers"" were found to have pursued natural birth ""at any cost"".

Jenny said: ""You think after they've had all these issues and they've implemented new protocols and procedures and they assure everyone that everything's going to be okay you do think, well, they will have learned from the lessons.

""But then you also think what would you do as an alternative, because where else is there to go that can guarantee suitable care that isn't also struggling with problems?""

Stillbirth cases believed to be a 'widespread issue'

Lucy Mellor, a medical negligence solicitor with the firm JMW, says they are ""contacted on a weekly basis by somebody who has unfortunately lost a baby"".

They have handled hundreds of stillbirth cases from around the country and believe it's a ""widespread issue"".

""I definitely see patterns and themes cropping up in these sorts of cases and they tend to relate to the national guidelines not being followed,"" she says.

""One theme, for example, is just the lack of general care. So things like mothers and babies not being monitored frequently.

""A general lack of midwives on duty is also a problem that we see quite often.""

In cases where women have been denied caesarean sections, she says ""it comes down to the subject of informed choice"".

""There are certain women who fall into a high-risk category where in accordance with the guidelines you need to be having that discussion with them. You need to talk through their options.

""Obviously it's up to them whether they go ahead and they decide to have a C-section, but if you don't raise it with them in the first place and have that discussion where you're talking about the risk to you, the risk to the baby and also the potential benefits for you and the baby, then there's the potential for something to go wrong.""

'We want staff to work together'

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""It is vital that NHS trusts focus on safe, personalised care across maternity services, where the voice of the mother is heard throughout.

""We want NHS staff of all professions and disciplines to work together with women and families to deliver co-produced personalised and safe care.

""The NHS is investing £127 million in maternity services in the next year to help increase the maternity NHS workforce and improve neonatal care.

""This is on top of £95 million invested into the establishment of 1,200 midwives and 100 consultant obstetricians.""

694;Laura Winham, 38, lay dead in her flat in Woking for more than three years;Friday 27 January 2023 13:49, UK;[];[];['dead', 'winhams', 'ms', 'lay', 'laura', 'thirdparty', 'unable', '38', 'solicitors', 'winham', 'flat', 'family', 'care', 'written', 'woking'];"A woman was found in a ""mummified and skeletal state"" after lying dead in her flat for more than three and a half years.

Laura Winham, 38, was discovered at her home in Woking, Surrey, by her brother in May 2021.

Dental records showed she died in November 2017, the family's solicitors said, adding that she had ""only a small amount of spare change to her name"".

The markings on her calendar stopped, shortly after she had written ""I need help"".

Hudgell Solicitors said Ms Winham's rent continued to be paid through housing benefits, and a gas safety check was registered as having been carried out by contractors in January 2018, two months after she died.

Her sister, Nicky, said the family were unable to maintain contact with her.

Years of schizophrenia had led her to believe they would harm her, she said.

""Nobody ever physically checked on her,"" the solicitors said, despite her being sectioned twice, first in 2006.

The gas supply to her property was cut off in January 2019, they added.

Surrey Police said it was satisfied there was ""no third-party involvement"" in Ms Winham's death.

A spokeswoman said officers found the body on 24 May 2021. She added: ""An investigation was completed and officers were satisfied that there was no third-party involvement. A file was passed to the coroner.

""Officers previously attended the address in October 2017. No offences were identified and a report was completed and shared with adult social care at that time.""

Image: The first floor flat in Woking where Ms Winham was found

Nicky claimed social care and mental health teams had ""turned a blind eye"" and everybody with a duty of care had ""wiped their hands of her and forgot (Laura)"".

Speaking before a pre-inquest review at Surrey Coroner's Court, due to begin next week, her sister said: ""Laura has been so badly let down.

""It's just heart-breaking to think of how she lived in her last few years, unable to ask for help, without anyone there for her. It's just tragic.""

Solicitor Iftikhar Manzoor, acting for the family, said ""so many red flags"" were ""missed"".

He has written to the coroner calling for an Article 2 Inquest to be held, which would widen the scope to consider whether correct procedures were followed.

Nicky said the family initially felt ""reassured"" that Laura had been ""given her own home, she was entitled to benefits, she had her own car and some part-time work"".

The family also ""believed she would be supported by her mental health team and others moving forward"", Nicky added.

She went on: ""We always hoped she would get better with professional help and that one day our contact would resume. We never believed for one second we would end up finding her dead on her floor having laid there for so long without anyone knowing.

""We are sharing our story because we do not want any other families to suffer in this way.""

Surrey County Council and Woking Borough Council offered their ""heartfelt"" and ""deepest"" condolences to Ms Winham's family.

They said they would continue to support the coroner with their inquiries and the inquest process.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127134149/http://news.sky.com/story/laura-winham-38-lay-dead-in-her-flat-in-woking-for-more-than-three-years-12796622
695;Shopping habits could help spot signs of ovarian cancer;Friday 27 January 2023 12:27, UK;['lauren russell', '@laurenvrussell'];['cancer', 'health'];['habits', 'ovarian', 'research', 'women', 'symptoms', 'purchases', 'shopping', 'help', 'cancer', 'spot', 'diagnosed', 'stage', 'study', 'uk', 'signs'];"Tracking what shoppers buy through loyalty cards can help spot cases of ovarian cancer earlier, a study has found.

Involving nearly 300 women, the study found a ""noticeable increase"" in the purchase of pain and indigestion medication among those who were later diagnosed with ovarian cancer, compared to women who did not have the disease.

The change in purchasing habits happened up to eight months before a diagnosis, suggesting that individuals are treating symptoms at home before seeking advice from a GP.

Results showed that women with ovarian cancer began to recognise their symptoms around four-and-a-half months before diagnosis.

Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the UK, with around 7,400 women, or individuals with ovaries, diagnosed each year, and more than 4,000 deaths annually.

The findings, published in the journal JMIR Public Health and Surveillance and funded by Cancer Research UK, analysed loyalty card data of 283 women and, of these,153 had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

Six years worth of purchases from two UK-based high-street retailers were examined, with participants also asked to complete a short questionnaire about ovarian cancer risk factors, symptoms they experienced - if any - and the number of visits to their GP.

Ovarian Cancer: The symptoms to spot Symptoms of ovarian cancer can be unclear in the early stages of the disease. They often include: loss of appetite, stomach pain and bloating. These symptoms can lead to women buying medication from a local pharmacy. Around 93% of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer at the earliest stage - stage one - can survive for five years or more. This is compared to 13% when diagnosed at the latest stage - stage four.

Lead author Dr James Flanagan, from Imperial College London's department of surgery and cancer, said that the symptoms are ""very common"", but for some women ""could be the first signs of something more serious"".

""Using shopping data, our study found a noticeable increase in purchases of pain and indigestion medications among women with ovarian cancer up to eight months before diagnosis, compared with women without ovarian cancer,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Jamaica and Kenya have tumbled out of the top 10, according to new analysis of the 2021 census data.

Other new entries in the top 10 include Poland and Nigeria, but there have been sharp drops for Australia and Canada.

The figures, released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show how the top non-UK countries of birth in England and Wales have changed in recent decades.

India was the most common non-UK country at both the 2021 and 2011 census, and the second most common in 2001.

Ireland has slipped from first place in 2001 to fourth in 2011 and fifth in 2021.

The rest of the top 10 has seen major changes, however.

Romania ranked 86th in 2001 and by 2011 had climbed to 26, before jumping to fourth place in 2021.

Poland has risen from 18th in 2001 to second in 2021, while Nigeria is up from 14th to eighth.

But Jamaica has fallen out of top 10, dropping from sixth place in 2001 to 20th in 2021, along with the US (from seventh to 11th) and Kenya (ninth to 21st).

""The rise in position of both Poland and Romania is likely because they joined the EU in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and therefore gained entitlement to free movement,"" the ONS said.

""These changes over the last 20 years reflect a notably different picture of international migration over time.""

This is borne out by trends further down the rankings, which show China rising from being 25th at the 2001 census to 12th in 2021.

Other notable movers were Spain (up from 23rd to 13th), Portugal (34th to 15th) and the Philippines (30th to 17th).

By contrast, leaving the top 20 are Australia, which has fallen from 11th place in 2001 to 26th in 2021, Cyprus (down from 15th to 37th) and Canada (17th to 38th).

The report by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) offered the latest confirmation that the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad used chemical weapons during his country's grinding civil war.

The organisation said ""reasonable grounds to believe"" is the standard of proof consistently adopted by international fact-finding bodies and commissions of inquiry.

At the time of the attack, graphic images were published showing a number of dead children who appeared to have been frothing at the mouth.

The Syrian American Medical Society also described patients foaming at the mouth, saying victims suffered corneal burns and smelled of a ""chlorine-like odour"". One woman had convulsions and pinpoint pupils, the society said.

Two yellow cylinders were dropped on Douma, the OPCW report found.

The two cylinders carrying chlorine were modified and filled at the Dumayr air base and the helicopter or helicopters that dropped them were under control of the Syrian military's elite Tiger Force, the report added.

One of the containers hit the roof of a three-storey residential building and ruptured.

On impact, the report said it ""rapidly released toxic gas, chlorine, in very high concentrations, which rapidly dispersed within the building killing 43 named individuals and affecting dozens more"".

A second cylinder burst through the roof of another building into an apartment below and only partially ruptured, ""mildly affecting those who first arrived at the scene"", the report added.

Syrian authorities refused the investigation team access to the sites of the chlorine attacks.

Syria, which joined the OPCW in 2013 under pressure from the international community after being blamed for another deadly chemical weapon attack, does not recognise the investigation team's authority and has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons.

The country had its OPCW voting rights suspended in 2021 as punishment for the repeated use of toxic gas, the first such sanction imposed on a member nation.

The recent investigation was set up to identify perpetrators of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, building on earlier findings by the OPCW that chlorine was used as a weapon in Douma.

The watchdog interviewed dozens of witnesses and studied the blood and urine of survivors as well as samples of soil and building materials, according to the watchdog agency.

Investigators also carefully assessed and rejected alternative theories for what happened, including Syria's claim that the attack was staged and that bodies of people killed elsewhere in Syria were taken to Douma to look like victims of a gas attack.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127134149/http://news.sky.com/story/douma-chemical-attack-that-killed-43-in-syria-was-likely-work-of-regimes-air-force-international-watchdog-finds-12796578

Shares of Gautam Adani's flagship Adani Enterprises sank by 20% on Friday alone in the wake of Wednesday's report by New York-based Hindenburg Research that questioned his group's business practices and debt levels.

Wider stock market sentiment in India has also plunged in the wake of the study, with banks that have exposure to Adani firms coming under particular pressure.

The sector held 40% of the $24.5bn of Adani Group debt in the financial year to March 2022.

In addition to the report's concerns related to debt, flags were also raised about alleged improper use of entities set up in

offshore tax havens, stock market manipulation and accounting fraud.

The group has denied the accusations and said it is considering the prospect of legal action on the grounds that the report is baseless.

The Reuters news agency said that India's capital markets regulator was studying the Hindenburg report and could use it to aid its own ongoing investigation into offshore fund holdings of Adani Group.

Mr Adani's other listed entities have suffered big reductions to their market value - in line with Adani Enterprises.

They include Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, Adani Green Energy and Adani Ports.

The stock market plunge has also seen Mr Adani's position tumble from third in the world's richest league.

With an estimated net worth of $97.6bn (£79bn) he is now the world's seventh richest man, according to Forbes.

Saurabh Jain, assistant vice-president of research at SMC Global Securities, said of the market mayhem in India: ""The sell-off is seriously extreme ... it has clearly dented the overall investor sentiment.""

The cross-border fire came after an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank on Thursday that led to the largest single death toll in years of fighting in the area.

The overnight rockets triggered sirens in Israeli communities near the border with Gaza, warning residents to take shelter.

There were no reports of injuries.

Israel's Channel 12 aired footage of Israeli interceptor missiles being launched above the city of Ashkelon, about seven miles (12km) north of Gaza, which is controlled by the Islamist militant group Hamas.

A few hours later, Israel's military said it had carried out strikes in Gaza.

Palestinian witnesses said Israeli aircraft had targeted a Hamas training camp.

No injuries were reported.

After the Jenin violence, the Palestinian Authority said it was ending its security coordination with Israel.

The arrangement has been widely credited with helping to keep order in the West Bank and preventing attacks against Israel.

Alex Gerko, the founder of XTX Markets who has British citizenship, was deemed to have stumped up £487.4m in the last tax year by the Sunday Times Tax List.

The sum is the equivalent of around £55,639 an hour, the report said, as it revealed a shake-up at the top of the rankings.

The founder of online gambling firm Bet365, Denise Coates, and her family were shifted into second place for the first time in the list's history.

They were said to have paid £460.2m to UK coffers on the back of their earnings.

The top ten taxpayers, main area of interest, and estimated sum:

• Alex Gerko (financial trading) £487.4m

• Denise, John and Peter Coates (gambling) £460.2m

• Stephen Rubin and family (sportswear) £392.3m

• Sir Chris Hohn (hedge fund) £263m

• Fred and Peter Done and family (gambling) £136.8m

• Mike Ashley (sports equipment and fashion) £133.5m

• Tim Martin (pubs) £123.2m

• Ranjit and Baljinder Boparan and family (food) £120.7m

• Tom Morris and family (retail) £112.2m

• Ian and Richard Livingstone (property) £104m

Image: Denise Coates and her family have headed the list for the past three years

Other big names in the top 100 include Sting, the Duke of Westminster and Harry Potter author JK Rowling.

Those making the list were liable for a total of almost £5.2bn of UK tax last year - with the top ten responsible for delivering £2.3bn alone - a rise of nearly 14% on the total reported 12 months ago.

The sums are calculated based on publicly available filings and can include corporation tax, dividend tax, capital gains tax, income tax and payroll tax payments, along with any gambling and alcohol duties.

Who is Alex Gerko?

Mr Gerko - unlike many of the others making the top 100 - is not a household name.

He owns 75% of algorithm-led trading firm XTX which, according to Bloomberg, paid out a dividend of £1.3bn last March.

Mr Gerko has many charitable interests and those have reportedly included support for Ukraine-linked causes in the wake of Russia's invasion.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is also under pressure on the issue of tax. He is facing pressure from critics on multiple fronts, with Tory backbenchers keen on tax cuts and others urging him to make the wealthiest pay more to help ease the budget deficit and pay striking public sector workers more.

In a speech today he appeared to rule out any immediate tax cuts while talking up Britain's economic prospects.

Robert Watts, the list's author, said: ""You will find celebrities on the Tax List but many of the entries are people who quietly run largely unheralded businesses that have been creating jobs and paying millions of tax for decades or even centuries.

""So-called 'unicorn' tech firms may dominate the headlines, but they often aren't cash cows for the Treasury because they don't employ large numbers of people or show big profits.

""It's the long-established retailers, pub groups and other bricks-and-mortar businesses that often contribute more.

Luke Ansell, 27, and his wife Eloise, moved into to their new Dorset property in December, and ordered the new £2,000 sofa from Designersofas4u.

However, when it was finally delivered on the 19 January, Mr Ansell claims that despite his warnings the staircase was narrow, the staff from the sofa company said it would be fine - but then abandoned the delivery after leaving what appeared to be damage to the wall.

He said: ""Honestly it was unbelievable, the sofa was over £2,000, and they caused about that much damage delivering it.

""They brought it in, they struggled to get it over the bannister and eventually got it in. But then it got jammed, they couldn't get it up or down.

""Then they said 'look we've got to get back to Birmingham' and tried to leave. They asked me to sign for the delivery - but I refused.

""We had a little bit of an argument about it, and then they suggested I cut away the bannister to get it out.

""It's a brand-new house that we had just bought for half a million, and now we have to have the work done to repair it.""

In response to the claims, Designersofas4u told Sky News it refutes Mr Ansell's account of events, saying: ""As part of our investigation, it was uncovered that Mr Ansell was made aware of the delivery space situation by our drivers.

""We have a recorded telephone conversation from Mr Ansell that took place whilst our drivers were on site and before any furniture was taken into the property.

""In this conversation Mr Ansell is informing our office 'I've got your deliverymen here, and they don't seem to think they can get the sofas in here.' He later goes on to say 'Alright we will give it a go'.""

The company sent Sky News the transcript of the conversation between Mr Ansell and its customer service agent.

Mr Ansell said: ""Yeah it can get through the door, but it can't get [to the] room it needs to get to. They're saying it's too tight.""

Customer services replied: ""What would you like to do? There's no point [trying] to deliver as it's not going to fit in the room.""

Mr Ansell then said: ""Alright we will give it a go"".

Designersofas4u also claim to have video doorbell footage from Mr Ansell, purporting to say it would be fine to try to bring the sofa in.

The company also shared an email it sent to Mr Ansell, in which it shares a number of its terms and conditions, one of which says it is the customer's responsibility to make sure the sofa can get in the property safely, and it cannot be held responsible for damages. It also says the cost of the sofa was in fact £1,129 - not £2,000.

Designersofas4u also offered him a new sofa free of charge, and help paying for the damages as a goodwill gesture.

Mohammad Farooq, 27, was allegedly inspired by radical Islam and Jihad when he carried out ""hostile reconnaissance"" of the military base in Yorkshire on 10 January and 18 January after carrying out online research.

He is said to have constructed a viable bomb made from a pressure cooker, 13.7kg of a homemade low explosive mixture and a length of pyrotechnic fuse.

Farooq was arrested in the early hours of last Friday outside the maternity unit of St James's Hospital in Leeds, where he had been due to work a shift.

He was allegedly in possession of the explosive device and an imitation firearm - a Gediz 9mm P.A.K semi-automatic pistol.

His actions at the hospital are not alleged to have been motivated by terrorism but by a grudge towards another member of staff.

Farooq, from Leeds, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday from a police station in Bradford wearing a grey tracksuit.

He spoke to confirm his name, address and date of birth but was not asked to enter pleas to the three charges he faces.

Farooq is charged with one count of engaging in conduct with the intention of committing acts of terrorism between 12 July and last year and 20 January.

Wards on the Gledhow wing of the hospital were evacuated after Farooq was detained at around 5am last Friday.

Army specialists and a bomb disposal unit also attended the scene and a cordon was put in place as a precautionary measure.

Four months on, he's earned praise for balancing the books but still had a blank space to fill in when it comes to growth - a crucial plank of economic policy in danger of becoming a dirty word after Truss pursued it over a cliff edge.

The economic circumstances remain deeply challenging, with inflation running above 10%, interest rates on the rise and public sector workers demanding pay rises while business and Conservative backbenchers want tax cuts to incentivise investment.

Two months before his first budget, the chancellor was not about to blow a reputation for rectitude by announcing detailed new policy.

Instead, we got a speech that, in tone if not style, could have been delivered by Boris Johnson, recasting the economic challenge as a debate between optimists and pessimists.

Brexit, Mr Hunt said, remains the opportunity on which future prosperity will be based, despite the myriad challenges reported by businesses at the sharp end.

He had statistics to prove it. Britain has performed ""about as well"" as Germany since 2016 and better than Japan, Italy and France on one measure of GDP since 2010.

Asked by Sky News whether it would be more honest to acknowledge that Brexit had failed to live up to promises, he said no.

""It's a big change in our economic relations with our closest neighbours and of course that is going to need adaptation,"" he said.

""Of course there is some short-term disruption, but I think it's completely wrong to just focus on that without looking at the opportunities.""

Anyone denying the UK was well-placed to thrive was peddling ""declinism"", a characterisation with echoes of Johnson's ""gloomsters"" that channelled the crudest divisions of the referendum debate.

Those guilty, Mr Hunt said, include newspaper columnists on the left and right, and the Labour Party.

Judging by conversations in the margins of his speech, he also blames a number of Britain's largest employers, who have called for more business-friendly government policy.

For the backbenchers who have lobbied hard for tax cuts despite the recent trauma of Truss' unfunded giveaway, there was a clear message.

""The best tax cut right now is a cut in inflation,"" he said.

That means do not expect much in March.

For the audience in the room, entrepreneurs and investors in the new technologies, life sciences and advanced manufacturing crucial to delivering growth, the message was delivered with a broad brush.

He said enterprise and education were priorities, pointing to the natural advantages of the City of London and the brains trust of the UK's world-leading universities.

New investment worth up to £100bn would be unlocked when reforms to EU-era regulation governing the reserves held by insurance companies are finally passed ""in the coming months"", he said.

The chancellor did not deny that the economy faces challenges, referring to the ""productivity puzzle"" that has seen output still not recover to pre-pandemic levels.

He said increasing employment was the key, highlighting a shortage of workers that many businesses blame on new Brexit immigration controls.

Mr Hunt preferred to focus on the growth of ""economic inactivity"" - those of working age who are not in work, by choice or through illness.

Around one-in-five 16-64 year olds currently meet that definition, 6.6 million people once students are removed from the figures.

Mr Hunt promised help to get the long-term sick back to work and then made a striking direct appeal to retirees: ""To those who retired early after the pandemic, or haven't found the right role after furlough, I say - Britain needs you.""

Persuading those who don't need to work to come back to the daily grind may be a tall order.

Boxing promoter Leslie Allen, 66, recruited a group of people to help him get off charges of having £150,000 of cannabis and cocaine and a pepper spray in 2018.

However, the plot backfired ""spectacularly"" after other jurors in the Warwick Crown Court case became suspicious of Damien Drackley's behaviour during deliberations.

Drackley was reported to the judge who went on to convict Allen without the jury and jail him for 13 years.

After a trial at the Old Bailey, Allen, Drackley, 37, Mark Walker, 57, who was known as ""Walker the one-legged mechanic"", and Laurence ""Del Boy"" Hayden, 54, were found guilty of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

Drackley's mother Lorraine Frisby, 56, from Birmingham, had admitted the charge and soliciting the disclosure of jury deliberations.

On Friday they were all handed jail sentences by Mr Justice Cavanagh.

Leader Allen was handed five years to run consecutively to his drugs sentence.

""Naive and foolish"" Drackley was given four years for his part in the plot.

The 52-year-old Marvel actor was using the PistenBully machine to help his nephew Alexander Fries free his Ford pickup truck from the snow, when the plough began to roll down the hill.

He broke more than 30 bones when he was sucked under the plough's tracks on New Years Day, as he attempted to get into the cab to stop it moving. Mr Renner sustained injuries to his ""torso, face, extremities and head"".

The actor's nephew began ""screaming for help"" as he did not have his phone.

Two neighbours then provided towels and assistance to Mr Renner until emergency services arrived at the scene near the Mount Rose Highway, close to the Nevada-California border in the US.

A report from Washoe County deputy Garret Leone said that after he had arrived at the scene of the accident, he spoke to Mr Fries - who had been the only witness.

""They had a chain connected to the back of the PistenBully and to the front of the Ford pickup. They got the pickup truck out of the driveway and Alexander parked in the middle of the street,"" Mr Leone said.

""While running towards the truck, Alexander observed Jeremy jumping on the tracks of the PistenBully to get in the cab of the vehicle. Alexander said Jeremy got caught on and was ultimately run over,"" Mr Leone added.

Having not put the handbrake on the plough - which runs on a track - it started to roll directly towards Mr Fries.

In the week ending 17 January, an estimated 1.1 million people in private households are likely to have had COVID, which is down 39% from 1.8 million in the previous week.

This is the lowest total since late November.

The number of people in hospital with the virus has also fallen by 40% since the start of the year, according to NHS data, providing further evidence the virus is less prevalent.

The ONS survey showed in England, an estimated one in 60 people tested positive, in comparison to one in 55 in Wales, one in 30 in Northern Ireland and one in 55 in Scotland.

Infections peaked at 3.0 million at the end of December 2022 after a surge in cases in the run-up to Christmas.

The majority of current COVID infections are due to the variant known as BQ.1, which is part of the Omicron family.

COVID-19 by region and age

Infections fell in all regions across the UK.

In London around one in 57 (1.3%) people had the virus, while in the South West it was one in 50 (2%).

Analysis also showed that infection rates decreased in all age groups, except those aged two-10, where the trend was uncertain.

The 70 and overs category has the highest rate at one in 48 (2.1%) followed by 50-69 at around one in 62 (1.8%) on previous weeks.

Michelle Bowen, ONS head of health surveillance, said the ""picture is generally a positive one"", with infections in England ""back below one million and the lowest they've been in seven weeks"".

The number of people in hospital in England with COVID currently stands at 5,632. This figure peaked at 9,535 on 29 December - still significantly below previous waves.

Booster vaccines planned for autumn and spring

The latest survey keeps in line with data obtained from the 2022 COVID autumn booster programme, which launched back in early September.

More than 82% of people aged 75 and over have received the jab. A total of 64.5% of those aged 50 and over have also had a booster vaccination.

Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency, said that although flu and COVID cases are falling, ""winter is not over yet and we need to guard against further surges"".

""We know and remember that indifference kills along with hatred. Indifference and hatred are always capable of creating evil together only,"" he said.

""That is why it is so important that everyone who values ​​life should show determination when it comes to saving those whom hatred seeks to destroy.""

While in London, another 92-year-old - Vera Schaufeld - whose parents were murdered in a concentration camp, raised concerns about whether young people are learning enough about the atrocities of the past.

She said: ""Antisemitism is more prevalent than it has been in the past because I think young people are no longer learning about the Holocaust as much as they did.""

Ms Schaufeld, who was born in Prague in 1930 but came to England via the Kindertransport in 1938, added: ""Jewish people should be seen just as much as individuals, and not as a whole group, but understood that they have their own views and their own lives in the same way that every other minority has to be respected.

""And it has to be understood that their experiences and their lives are relevant to them and their families.""

The discovery of these elements could help produce parts for wind turbines and electric car batteries, which require things like neodymium and dysprosium to be manufactured.

Officials also found there is 38 million tonnes of copper on the seabed, which equates to twice what is mined globally every year, and around 45 million tonnes of zinc in polymetallic sulphides.

Magnesium, niobium, cobalt, which are on the European list of critical minerals, were also discovered,

The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, which carried out the research, said: ""For several of the metals, the mineral resources are sufficient to cover many years of global consumption.

""The transition to a low-emission society enhances the need for specific elements.""

Norway, which is a major global exporter of oil and gas, will now need to decide whether to open the offshore areas to deep-sea miners - a decision that requires the approval of parliament.

Sulphides are found along the mid-ocean ridge, where magma from below the earth's surface, meets the sea floor at depths of around 3,000 metres.

However, the decision to open up the seas to miners could come at an environmental cost, according to campaigners.

Norway's Institute of Marine Research said in a consultation letter that more work needs to be conducted on the way the organisms live on the sea bed, and what the impact of mining would be.

It added that while estimates from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate showed estimated levels of minerals, further studies will also be needed to work out what can be taken within acceptable environmental levels.

Not long after the discovery was announced, the Kremlin in Russia revealed President Vladimir Putin held a meeting of his security council to discuss the borders and boundaries of the continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean, which was attended by the likes of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127160802/https://news.sky.com/story/norway-discovers-substantial-levels-of-metals-and-minerals-on-its-seabed-12796586

Lucy Letby, 33, made the remark during a series of collapses of infants at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neo-natal unit, Manchester Crown Court heard.

GP Lucy Beebe told police she saw a tearful Letby talking with a colleague in one of the care rooms at the unit.

Giving evidence on Friday, Dr Beebe said: ""I remember Lucy crying with another nurse and it was very much of the gist of 'it's always me when it happens, my babies, it's always happening to me a lot'.""

Prosecutor Philip Astbury asked: ""Who was saying that?

Dr Beebe replied: ""Lucy.""

Mr Astbury said: ""You can't remember precisely when that was?""

""No,"" said the witness.

Dr Beebe said she cared for a premature-born girl, Child I, during her spell as a GP trainee doctor at the Countess of Chester.

The Crown say neo-natal nurse Letby murdered Child I in the early hours of 23 October 2015.

It was said to be her fourth attempt to deliberately harm the baby after trying previously on 30 September, 13 and 14 October.

Dr Beebe said: ""I recall (Child I) because it was unusual that she was seemingly well and then became unwell.

""In my memory I felt like she was shipped out to a tertiary centre, made a rapid recovery and then was brought back very quickly.

""It certainly stuck in my memory because it had never happened to a baby I had been involved in the care of before or since, at any of the neo-natal units I worked at.""

Asked about her reaction to Child I's death, she replied: ""Shock and frustration at the time because on reflection I felt there was something else going on with (Child I) that we were not getting to the bottom of.

""It was sad because I remember the family and the whole situation was just very sad and frustrating.""

Letby, originally from Hereford, denies murdering seven babies and attempting to murder 10 others between June 2015 and June 2016.

Daniel Harris used an online platform called World Truth Videos to disseminate a ""call to arms"" for his violent racist beliefs, a court heard.

The 19-year-old from Glossop in Derbyshire was convicted of five counts of encouraging terrorism and one of possessing a 3D printer for the purposes of terrorism after a trial at Manchester Crown Court.

He was sentenced to 11-and-a-half years in jail, and a further three years on licence.

Prosecutors said US mass killer Payton Gendron was ""encouraged and, in part, motivated to do what he did"" by Harris.

Gendron murdered 10 black people in a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, in May 2022 while livestreaming the attack. Within hours, Harris produced a video celebrating the killing spree.

Gendron, 19, had left a comment on one of Harris's videos two months before the mass shooting, saying: ""You are not alone my friend :)"".

The video included lessons to be learned from Brenton Tarrant, who livestreamed an attack in which he killed 51 people at mosques in New Zealand in March 2019.

Gendron had also taken an image from another of Harris's videos and used it as the main image on his ""manifesto"".

Prosecutor Joe Allman said Gendron was ""inspired"" by Harris's material.

The British teenager also influenced Anderson Lee Aldrich, the only suspect in a shooting at a gay bar in Colorado, the court was told.

Aldrich, 22, allegedly killed five people during an indiscriminate firearms attack in Colorado Springs, in November last year - while Harris was on trial in the UK.

Aldrich - who is yet to enter pleas over the Colorado shooting - ""accessed material"" produced by Harris, Mr Allman said.

The prosecutor told the court one of Harris's videos was posted on the ""brother site"" to a website with links to what appeared to be a livestream of Aldrich preparing to carry out the attacks.

Mr Allman said: ""The Crown say it demonstrates that individuals of the greatest concern have accessed the material produced by Mr Harris.""

Harris was described in court as an ""influential online propagandist for a violent and deeply racist ideology"".

His videos glorified mass killings and were ""tantamount to a call to arms to those who shared, or who could be persuaded to share Mr Harris's world view,"" Mr Allman said.

Under the pseudonym ""BookAnon"", Harris's videos ""encouraged and gave instructions for carrying out acts of terror against those deemed not to be part of the white European race,"" the court heard.

One video showed how to make an assault rifle using a 3D printer and when police raided Harris's grandfather's house, they found that he had begun making the parts himself.

'Toxic rhetoric with untold influence'

After the teenager's conviction, Detective Inspector Chris Brett said attempts were initially made to engage with Harris through the Prevent programme, which aims to stop people becoming terrorists.

""It soon became clear he was pretending to be deradicalised whilst encouraging terrorism online,"" Mr Brett added.

""The threat he caused meant we had to act in order to ensure the safety of the wider public.""

Mr Brett said Harris ""clearly demonstrated a disdain for law enforcement and public order, as well as an admiration for those who had committed atrocities in terrorist attacks overseas"".

""By posting these videos online, Harris' toxic rhetoric could have had untold influence on countless people across the world - such actions will not be tolerated,"" the senior officer said.

Just over a third of holidaymakers had planned to take steps to make their breaks less expensive (34%), while a further 16% will go without taking holidays altogether, according to insurer Aviva.

Among those who plan to save money on their travels, 28% have chosen to take UK-based breaks rather than going abroad and around 26% want to travel out of peak season to save more.

A quarter have said they will shorten the duration of their holidays, while 13% eat away from tourist attractions and find a lesser-known destination.

In order to save money, 20% said they would book well in advance to get a good deal, while the same amount said they would wait for last-minute deals.

Meanwhile, one in five people said they are looking to cut holiday plans to set a spending limit for their getaway.

'It's concerning to see... people would think about not taking out travel cover'

Hoping to reduce costs further, one in 14 holidaymakers plan to cut costs by not taking out travel insurance.

Kelly Whittington, speciality claims director at Aviva UK, said: ""Holidaymakers have some really good ideas on how to save, from setting themselves a spending limit to looking for last-minute deals.

""However, it's concerning to see that a small number of people would think about not taking out travel cover as unfortunately the unexpected can and does happen.

""This can mean anything from requiring medical treatment overseas, to lost luggage, to a stolen passport while abroad.""

As a result of this, Whittington said holidaymakers could face ""unforeseen costs of hundreds, thousands of pounds - even five or six-figure sums in some instances - particularly where medical bills are concerned.""

730;Alan Cumming gives back OBE over links to 'toxic' British Empire;Friday 27 January 2023 14:54, UK;[];[];['given', 'links', 'toxic', 'queens', 'birthday', 'gives', 'award', '2009', 'empire', 'rights', 'work', 'cumming', 'alan', 'obe', 'honours', 'british'];"Alan Cumming has given back his OBE, expressing concern over its links to what he describes as the ""toxicity"" of the British Empire.

The actor said he had made the decision to return the award after listening to conversations about the future of the Royal Family after the Queen's death.

Cumming was made an OBE in 2009 as part of the Queen's birthday honours, being recognised for acting, as well as the work he does to campaign for LGBTQ+ rights in the US.

He said at the time that he was ""shocked and delighted"" to be given the honour.

Writing on Instagram on his 58th birthday, he said: ""The Queen's death and the ensuing conversations about the role of monarchy and especially the way the British Empire profited at the expense (and death) of indigenous peoples across the world really opened my eyes.

""Fourteen years ago, I was incredibly grateful to receive it in the 2009 Queen's birthday honours list, for it was awarded not just for my job as an actor but 'for activism for equal rights for the gay and lesbian community, USA'.

""Back then the Defence of Marriage Act ensured that same-sex couples couldn't get married or enjoy the same basic legal rights as straight people, and Don't Ask, Don't Tell ensured that openly gay, lesbian or bisexual people were barred from serving in the military.""

He added: ""Thankfully, times and laws in the US have changed, and the great good the award brought to the LGBTQ+ cause back in 2009 is now less potent than the misgivings I have being associated with the toxicity of empire (OBE stands for Officer of the British Empire).

""So, I returned my award, explained my reasons and reiterated my great gratitude for being given it in the first place. I'm now back to being plain old Alan Cumming again. Happy birthday to me!""

731;Jeremy Hunt confirms HS2 will reach central London after reports it might stop in suburbs;Friday 27 January 2023 14:46, UK;['jennifer scott', '@nifs'];['hs2', 'jeremy hunt'];['confirms', 'mr', 'oak', 'old', 'project', 'suburbs', 'line', 'reports', 'london', 'central', 'euston', 'stop', 'hs2', 'hunt', 'reach', 'jeremy'];"HS2 will end at Euston after reports the high-speed line could stop before reaching central London, the chancellor has confirmed.

Jeremy Hunt said he did not see ""any conceivable circumstance"" the original plan would not be followed and that he was ""incredibly proud"" of the work going ahead.

The endpoint of the line came into question after a report in The Sun claimed the last leg of HS2 could be scrapped and replaced with a new hub at Old Oak Common in the suburbs of northwest London.

Politics live: 'Best tax cut right now is cut to inflation,' says Hunt

This would leave passengers having to finish their journey into the centre of the capital on the new Elizabeth underground line.

The government did not deny the reports or that a two to five-year delay to the entire project - currently due to be completed between 2029 and 2033 - was being considered due to record high inflation impacting costs.

However, when asked if he and the government were committed to the line ending in Euston as planned, Mr Hunt said: ""Yes we are.""

Image: Jeremy Hunt dismissed reports the Euston hub would be scrapped

The chancellor added: ""I don't see any conceivable circumstance in which that would not end up at Euston and indeed I prioritised HS2 in the autumn statement.

""We have not got a good record in this country of delivering complex, expensive infrastructure quickly but I'm incredibly proud that for the first time in this last decade under a Conservative government we have shovels in the ground, we are building HS2 and we are going to make it happen.""

Later, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman confirmed he was on the same page as Mr Hunt, and that the government was ""committed to the integrated rail plan"".

But when Mr Sunak was pushed by reporters later on Friday, he avoided answering questions over whether the project would be delayed.

Planning your route into London Making the final southern destination for HS2 a station at Old Oak Common - which is yet to be built - could well have saved the government billions. But what would the impact have been on passengers? Let's say Euston is your final destination. You would get off at the new station, which will be fairly close to Hammersmith in west London, and take the Elizabeth Line to Tottenham Court Road - a journey of around 15 minutes. From there, you could take the Northern Line three stops to Euston. Or, if you're feeling energetic, it would be a 20-minute walk.

The HS2 project has been dogged by criticism over its financial and environmental impact.

In October 2021, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove suggested capital investment for the line would be reviewed.

But after being installed at Number 11, Mr Hunt subsequently backed the project.

The target cost of Phase 1 between London and Birmingham was £40.3bn at 2019 prices, despite an overall budget of £55.7bn being set just four years earlier.

And more than £1bn has already been spent on work at Euston.

Penny Gaines from campaign group Stop HS2 said it is ""not at all surprising"" that costs were spiralling out of control.

""These reports just show that there are so many problems with HS2,"" she added. ""It's being delayed further and further so the cost is going up, it should be cancelled in its entirety as soon as possible.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127162455/http://news.sky.com/story/jeremy-hunt-confirms-hs2-will-reach-central-london-after-reports-it-might-stop-in-suburbs-12796388

Leanne Hainsby, 35, said in an Instagram post that she was diagnosed with cancer in August 2022.

Describing the period as ""unimaginably tough"", she said she has completed 12 weeks of chemotherapy and surgery.

In the social media post, she described finding a lump two days before the funeral of her close friend Danielle Hampson - the fiancée of X Factor star Tom Mann.

She wrote: ""After multiple scans and appointments with both consultants and cancer nurses, and being completely terrified for a few weeks, in August 2022 I was diagnosed with breast cancer.

""Where possible, I have continued to show up as 'normal' but my reality most of the time has looked very different.

""In terms of treatment and navigating my way through up until this point, it has been something I've kept very private,"" she said.

She added: ""As a Peloton instructor, a huge part of my role is all about the members, and despite my diagnosis, that has always mattered to me hugely.

""My classes have given me a focus and some sparkle in an otherwise incredibly tough time so thank you to the members who had no idea the amount of joy they were bringing to me every day.

""I'm in fantastic hands, and I've got this,"" she said.

""Nobody wants to be sat in a room and told they have cancer, and yet I've always felt one of the lucky ones.

""Lucky to be diagnosed early, lucky to be moving fast through treatment, lucky to know I will be ok.""

The next stages of her treatment will involve undergoing surgery to have her portacath - used during chemotherapy - removed, followed by two weeks of radiotherapy, she added.

The country has angled itself as one of Ukraine's key allies in its war with Russia, and had already pledged to hand over 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks, after lobbying Berlin to allow other countries to do so.

Speaking to Canadian television, Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland's prime minister said: ""Poland sent 250 tanks as the first country half a year ago or even more than that.

""Right now, we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession.""

PT-91 tanks are Polish-made battle vehicles, and began service in the 1990s, after being developed from the Soviet-era T-72s.

Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Poland for its announcement on Twitter, adding: ""Together we will win!""

Canada will send four Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, as will Norway, while Spain says it is also considering the move.

Polish deputy defence minister Marcin Ociepa told Polish media it would take three months before the tanks reached Ukraine, adding: ""It depends what country we are talking about, but I would estimate that we are talking about a quarter... until those tanks can be really on Ukrainian territory and go into battle.""

Earlier in the week, the US revealed it would also be sending the tanks to Ukraine.

President Biden said armoured capability has been ""critical for Ukraine"" and the US ""will train Ukrainian troops as soon as possible"", adding that Germany has ""really stepped up in support"" of Mr Zelenskyy's troops.

The US earlier said it would provide the necessary training and supplies needed to operate and run its M1 Abrams tanks as part of its ""long-term commitment that we have to Ukraine's defence leads"", a senior administration official said.

Kyiv has been pleading for months for Western nations to send modern battle tanks to give its forces the firepower and mobility it hopes will break through Russian defensive lines and recapture territory occupied by Russia.

Although Ukraine has stocks of Soviet-made tanks, President Zelenskyy says his forces need more, faster and deadlier weapons - in particular Western tanks - to push the Russians back.

Deekan Singh Vig was found guilty on Friday of murdering 86-year-old shopkeeper Arjan Singh Vig at the family home in Southgate, north London.

The Old Bailey had heard how officers found the body of Mr Vig on the evening of Saturday 30 October, 2021, on the floor of his son's bedroom with his ""head caved in"".

His 54-year-old son was naked and surrounded by about 100 bottles of Champagne, including blood-stained bottles of Veuve Cliquot and Bollinger.

""I killed my dad. I hit him over the head with a f***ing bloody bottle of Bollinger champagne,"" he said.

Prosecutor Deanna Heer KC had said the victim had been hit repeatedly in the face and head with a full bottle of Champagne, causing extensive injuries and almost immediate death.

Jurors heard how Vig had lived with his father and mother in their four-bedroom detached home for about 40 years.

The court was told he had developed a taste for alcohol during the COVID lockdown.

On the evening of the killing, Mrs Vig heard vomiting noises from her son's room and he told her he had consumed half a bottle of whisky, jurors heard.

The last thing she saw was her husband comforting their son, but she called her daughter when he appeared to get ""out of control"".

She then dialled 999.

When police arrived, the defendant told them he could not open the door, saying: ""You're too late. He's been dead for an hour.""

Once officers gained entry, they saw Mr Vig's head had been ""severely caved in"" and it was obvious he was dead.

The defendant, who was naked and had blood on his hands, feet and legs, was Tasered and detained.

Later, he wept as he said: ""My dad is dead. I killed my dad. I hit him over the head with a f***ing bloody bottle of Bollinger champagne. Why did I kill my dad?""

At the crime scene, police found 100 bottles of Champagne, 10 Amazon delivery boxes of whisky bottles, and an empty bottle of Talisker Scotch on the bed.

Beside Mr Vig's body were two bottles of Champagne - one Veuve Cliquot and the other Bollinger - with a ""significant amount"" of blood on them.

Vig had denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the basis that he did not intend to cause his father really serious harm.

A jury deliberated for less than a day to find him guilty of murder on Friday.

Judge Angela Rafferty adjourned sentencing until 10 February and remanded Vig in custody.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127164009/http://news.sky.com/story/man-found-naked-and-surrounded-by-champagne-guilty-of-bludgeoning-father-to-death-with-bottle-of-bollinger-12796793

It follows claims by more than 50 former patients who have previously told Sky News they were failed by the care they received at units run by The Huntercombe Group, now part of Active Care Group.

The death of a patient at one of the hospitals is currently being investigated by police.

Callum Smith worked at one of the units in Maidenhead in Berkshire - now called Taplow Manor.

He was employed from June 2019 until October last year. The hospital provides specialist help for youngsters with serious mental health conditions.

He said: ""There were a lot of incidents that could have been avoided. There are a lot of patients who maybe caused significant harm to themselves, which could have been avoided had we had more staff.""

Mr Smith said he was a senior support worker and his job involved allocating staff to patients. Some needed to be closely supervised because they were at risk of self harming.

He said he was concerned about inadequate staffing and training and claimed there were staffing issues ""pretty much every day"".

Mr Smith said: ""Due to lack of numbers, sometimes we would have to reduce observations that patients required.

""Let's say they were prescribed two staff members to be on that patient's observations... they'd sometimes be cut down to one and likewise any patients requiring three staff members would be cut down to two.""

Image: Callum Smith worked at Taplow Manor

Sky News has previously gathered testimonies from former patients who told us they felt that inadequate supervision left them at increased risk of self harm

Callum Smith also told us that the shortage of staff impacted what he called a ""basic human right"" to go to the toilet.

He said: ""Patients had a difficult time gaining access to the garden because they required a staff member to go with them.

""We even had it where toilet breaks and things like that for staff and patients weren't able to be facilitated because we just didn't have anybody that could take them. I felt bad, I felt horrendous.

""There were a lot of staff that really did care. Obviously, when we were below numbers - which was more often than not - that made it very challenging. It made it very difficult.""

Mr Smith said he was subject to disciplinary action after taking an unauthorized break. He says staffing levels meant he was not able to take proper breaks. He was given a written warning before resigning. His last full shift at the hospital was in February 2022.

Sky News has spoken to another former worker, Rebecca Smith, who also raised concerns about the impact of staffing levels.

She was employed at Taplow Manor as a support worker between May 2021 and November 2021.

""There weren't enough staff to respond to incidents when they occurred and the patients knew this,"" she said.

""For example, I remember a time when a patient was head banging so severely we had to intervene.

""But she lashed out at staff and then whilst staff were dealing with this incident, another patient was able to sneak away and tie a ligature - we were not aware because there were no staff left to watch the other patients.

""It was a patient that alerted us to what was going on. The girl who tied the ligature did not have anything to attach it to so she was physically okay, but obviously distressed by what had happened.""

Image: Taplow Manor provides specialist help for youngsters with serious mental health conditions

GMB union regional organiser David McMullen had been going into the Maidenhead unit for the last seven years to meet staff.

But the management of Taplow Manor no longer recognises the union.

Mr McMullen said: ""It always stood out as a problem workplace in the sense of the ratio of members we had there. The amount of time we spent in there dealing with issues when we compared it with other care homes and similar employers - there were always more issues there.

""But I think over the last year that has massively escalated.""

Inspectors from the regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), rated the Taplow Manor unit as ""requiring improvement"" in its latest assessment which was carried out in June 2022 and published in August 2022.

In the same report it rated safety overall as ""inadequate"".

The unit was inspected again in December last year but the results have not yet been published.

Thames Valley Police is currently investigating the death of a patient in February last year and a patient allegation of rape in 2019.

In October last year, Sky News - jointly with The Independent - revealed the testimonies of more than 20 former patients who went to units run by the Huntercombe Group - including Taplow Manor in Maidenhead.

They all claimed they were failed by the care they received.

There were recurring themes in what they revealed, including allegations that patients were left at increased risk of self harm because of inadequate supervision; allegations of over-use of restraint; and claims from some that they left feeling more traumatised than when they arrived.

In response to that report, over 30 further former patients came forward - independent of one another - raising similar concerns about their treatment.

We understand around 20 former patients are now considering legal action.

Image: David McMullen from the GMB union says problems have 'massively escalated'

Active Care Group, which took over The Huntercombe Group in December 2021, said: ""These unconfirmed accusations undermine the tremendous efforts being made by current employees to support those in their care at Taplow Manor.

""These allegations have been made by two junior former members of staff: one of whom was subject to disciplinary action. Neither has worked at the hospital for a year

""Staffing at Taplow Manor is monitored daily, and the shifts are fully staffed, often with an additional two to three workers on every shift, as well as therapists, doctors, teachers, nurses and ward managers.

""The last CQC report for Taplow Manor, published in August 2022, found: The service had enough nursing and support staff to keep children and young people safe. The service had reducing vacancy rates.'

Elli Investments Group is the former owner of The Huntercombe Group. It said: ""We regret that these hospitals and specialist care services, which were owned and independently managed by The Huntercombe Group, failed to meet the expected standards for high quality care.

""The Huntercombe Group was sold in March 2021 and the 12 hospitals and specialist care services that were the subject of that sale are now part of the Active Care Group. We wish Active Care Group well in their ongoing operations.""

In response to the report, NHS England told Sky News: ""The NHS continues to monitor these two units through regular site visits and speaking to current patients and staff following these shocking allegations - that is alongside reminding providers that as a minimum, their contracts require them to deliver safe, high-quality care to patients with safe staffing levels in place.""

Earlier this week, the Department for Health and Social Care announced a rapid review into inpatient mental health services in England.

It followed the concerns raised by Sky News along with other recent care failings, including the deaths of three teenage girls at Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust.

The review will look at NHS services as well as those provided by independent providers.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127170720/http://news.sky.com/story/inadequate-staffing-at-berkshire-mental-health-unit-put-young-people-at-risk-12796489

As well as the Godfather and Joker movie posters, officers' footage showed the boss had a picture of a lion on his living room wall, while a calendar featuring a scantily-clad woman was found hanging in a small room he used as a personal gym.

Everyday items such as an ironing board and a drying rack were also found, along with perfumes and designer clothes.

The apartment where Messina Denaro was believed to be living in the months before he was detained, was in a modest building in Campobello di Mazara, a few miles away from his home town of Castelvetrano.

He was living a ""regular"" life there, including going to the supermarket, according to magistrates.

741;Nicola Sturgeon accuses gender reform opponents of using women's rights as 'cloak of acceptability' for transphobia;Friday 27 January 2023 17:12, UK;[];['nicola sturgeon', 'scotland', 'transgender', 'women'];['scottish', 'bill', 'womens', 'recognition', 'using', 'reform', 'opponents', 'think', 'rights', 'transphobia', 'gender', 'cloak', 'parliament', 'sturgeon', 'nicola'];"Nicola Sturgeon has accused some opponents of Scotland's gender recognition reform of using women's rights as a ""cloak of acceptability"".

Scotland's first minister was careful to stress not all opponents of her government's Gender Recognition Reform Bill hold this view.

Her government approved the bill at the end of last year - not without opposition from her own party - to make it easier for those who wish to change gender to do so, with the minimum age requirement lowered to 16 from 18.

But earlier this month, the UK government made an unprecedented intervention and blocked the bill, refusing to allow it to receive Royal Assent - the final stage of any new bill.

Ms Sturgeon has rallied against the government decision and has now said some people opposing the bill are using women's rights as a cover for transphobia.

Some opposing the bill have raised concerns it will allow men to easily change their gender to prey on women and enter women-only safe spaces.

""I have heard people, politicians, claiming to be defenders of women's rights who I'd never heard defend women's rights in the past,"" she told Global's The News Agents podcast.

""In fact, I've heard some support policies that run counter to women's rights.

""We have legislation looming later in this parliament on criminal justice reform to try to deal with issues of low conviction rates for rape and sexual assault, we are likely to be dealing with legislation in months to come around abortion buffer zones.

""I think it will be interesting to see how many of the so-called defenders of women's rights in the context of the trans debate suddenly don't think that all women's rights are actually important.

Image: Women's rights supporters protested outside the Scottish Parliament ahead of the bill being passed

""There are some people that I think have decided to use women's rights as a sort of cloak of acceptability to cover up what is transphobia.

""Now, again, that's not everybody who opposes this bill. I want to be very clear about that.

""But there are people who have opposed this bill that cloak themselves in women's rights to make it acceptable, but just as they're transphobic you'll also find that they're deeply misogynist, often homophobic, possibly some of them racist as well.""

Westminster could abolish Scottish Parliament

The first minister also raised the prospect of the UK government abolishing the Scottish Parliament altogether after it used a Section 35 order on the bill for the first time.

A Section 35 order gives Westminster the power to block legislation approved by any devolved nation but had not before been used since it was introduced 25 years ago.

The first minister added: ""I've had people on my own side of the independence argument over the years say 'the Tories are capable of abolishing the Scottish Parliament or completely taking away significant powers'.

""I've always resisted that, that's hyperbole, let's not go down that road.

""Now, I still don't think it is likely they would try to abolish the Scottish Parliament - am I 100% sure of that anymore? No.

""But short of that, I do think there is a concerted effort to undermine, de-legitimise and remove powers from this parliament.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127172542/https://news.sky.com/story/nicola-sturgeon-accuses-gender-reform-opponents-of-using-womens-rights-as-cloak-of-acceptability-for-transphobia-12796827

Barry Martin, 38, from Fife, sustained serious injuries while fighting a blaze at the historic Jenners building on Rose Street on Monday.

He had been in a critical condition at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh but died today, Police Scotland said.

Four other firefighters were also taken to the hospital for treatment and were subsequently released.

Two were treated for burns and two for smoke inhalation.

A police officer was also treated for smoke inhalation at the hospital and later released.

Superintendent David Robertson, of Edinburgh Division, said: ""Our thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of Barry at this very difficult time.

""Our enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances.""

More than 100 firefighters tackled the blaze, which was reported around 11.30am on Monday.

Witnesses saw a soot-covered firefighter being helped from the building by colleagues.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the death as a ""terrible tragedy"".

""This is dreadfully sad news,"" she tweeted.

""My deepest condolences go to Barry's family, friends and colleagues.

""This is a terrible tragedy for all who loved him - but also a reminder of the selfless courage our firefighters demonstrate in the line of duty each and every day.""

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's interim chief officer said he and his colleagues were ""devastated"" by the death.

Ross Haggart said: ""I speak for the entire service when I say that we are all devastated by the loss of Barry and our thoughts remain with his family, friends and colleagues at this deeply distressing time.

""Both Barry's family and the service have been overwhelmed with the messages of support we have received and we thank everyone for the time they have taken to share these.

""Barry's family would also like to thank all the medical staff who have cared for him.""

The Maggie May singer called into the Your Say segment of Sarah-Jane Mee's show on Thursday to discuss the ongoing crisis in the NHS.

After listening, he offered to buy private cancer scans for up to 20 people who are on waiting lists worried about their illnesses.

But Sir Rod also revealed his change of heart when it came to politics, telling the show: ""I personally have been a Tory for a long time but I think this government should stand down now and give the Labour Party a go, this is heartbreaking.

Asked for her response to the comments on a visit to an ambulance station in Essex, Angela Rayner told reporters: ""Rod Stewart has given a voice to many people's frustrations at the moment, including Conservative voters.

""Because what the Conservatives have shown themselves to do, especially over the last couple of years, is not what they would consider to be Conservative.

""We've had low growth, high taxes, we've had cuts to our public services, we've had the economy that has been crashed, so I am not surprised that Rod Stewart has looked at that, anyone can look at this government's record and see that they've failed and that we need change now.""

'We had to change'

She said the support from the singer and ""the fact that Rod Stewart was able to see also the plan that Labour has is humbling for me and [Labour leader] Keir and the rest of the Labour team who knew we had to change the party, knew we had to listen to the voters and that hopefully they can see we have a plan to make things better into the future"".

Ms Rayner added: ""It is a sign, first of all, that the Conservatives are really on the wrong track and people can see that now.""

Earlier, Sir Keir Starmer joked that he and his deputy would be popping over to Sir Rod's house to ""have a singalong"".

Speaking to LBC, the Labour leader welcomed the ""headlines"" that came after the musician's appearance on Sky News, but added: ""I actually think what prompted Rod Stewart to say that was two things - this real sense that after 13 years now, pretty well everything is broken across the country, you just can't get anything to work, and that is frustrating for everybody.

Tyre Nichols, 29, passed away in hospital three days after the confrontation following a traffic stop in the city of Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

Bodycam footage of the altercation is expected to be released later on Friday evening.

His family said the ""very horrific"" video showed officers savagely beating the FedEx worker for three minutes in an assault their lawyers likened to the Los Angeles police attack on motorist Rodney King in 1991.

Five sacked officers, who are all black, have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, including assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression, over Mr Nichols's death.

Civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who is representing his family, said when the public watches the footage they will see him calling out for his mother.

He said: ""When you all see this video, you're going to see Tyre Nichols calling out for his mum.

""He calls out three times for his mother. His last words on this earth are, 'mum, mum, mum'. He's screaming for her. When you think about that kidnapping charge, he said 'I just want to go home'.""

""It's a traffic stop for God's sake. A simple traffic stop.""

Mr Nichols's mother, RowVaughn Wells, told reporters: ""For a mother to know their child was calling them in their need and I wasn't there for him. Do you know how I feel right now? Because I wasn't there for my son.""

Ms Wells recalled she had ""a really bad pain in my stomach"" and once she found out what happened she realised ""that was my son's pain that I was feeling"".

""For me to find out my son was calling my name, you have no clue how I feel right now,"" she added, struggling to hold back tears.

She also said she had not yet seen the video but urged anyone with children not to let them watch it.

""I have never seen the video but what I have heard is very horrific.""

She added the charged officers had ""disgraced their families"".

""I want to say to the five police officers who murdered my son, you also disgraced your own families when you did this.

""But I am going to pray for you and your families. Because this shouldn't have happened. We want justice for my son.""

She has pleaded for peaceful protests.

Police pulled Mr Nichols over for alleged reckless driving before there was an ""altercation"" where officers used pepper spray on him, according to Shelby County district attorney Steve Mulroy.

Mr Nichols then tried to flee on foot and another altercation followed, he added.

His family say the officers beat him and the injuries he sustained during the encounter led to his death.

Relatives accuse police of causing him to have a heart attack and kidney failure. Authorities have only said he experienced a medical emergency.

The officers were assigned to the 'scorpion' unit which focuses on violent street crime. The family's lawyers want it to be disbanded.

Memphis police chief Cerelyn Davis has said the department will review scorpion and other specialised units.

President Joe Biden said the Nichols family and the city of Memphis deserve ""a swift, full and transparent investigation"".

747;Moment of hammer attack on Paul Pelosi shown in new police bodycam video;Friday 27 January 2023 22:27, UK;[];['nancy pelosi'];['mr', 'suspect', 'shown', 'husband', 'depape', 'hammer', 'surveillance', 'paul', 'video', 'moment', 'bodycam', 'attack', '911', 'footage', 'pelosi'];"Police bodycam video has been released showing the moment a man attacked Nancy Pelosi's husband with a hammer in his San Francisco home.

Officers knock repeatedly on the front door - when it opens Mr Pelosi is holding the head of the hammer while the intruder is gripping the handle and trying to prise the 82-year-old's hand away.

Mr Pelosi refuses to let go, before the suspect suddenly seizes control and lunges at him with the weapon.

It's at this point Sky News has decided to stop the footage.

Police rush in, jump on the attacker and push him face down on the ground as Mr Pelosi lies motionless next to him.

The 28 October attack knocked Mr Pelosi unconscious and he had surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his arm and hands.

Former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most senior politicians in the US, was David DePape's intended target but was in Washington at the time.

Image: The attack happened at the couple's San Francisco home in October

She said on Friday that she wasn't going to watch the video.

""I have not heard the 911 call. I have not heard the confession. I have not seen the break-in. And I have absolutely no intention of seeing the deadly assault on my husband,"" she said.

Mrs Pelosi said her husband was ""making progress"" but it will ""take more time"".

The video is part of evidence newly released after journalists challenged a decision to keep it out of public view.

It also includes some of Mr Pelosi's 911 call, images from police surveillance cameras and video from DePape's police interview.

The surveillance video shows the suspect using a hammer to smash the glass of a door to get into the house.

DePape, 42, denies all the charges against him. They include attempted kidnapping, attempted murder, elder abuse and burglary.

High profile politicians are likely to be concerned after seeing this footage Martha Kelner US correspondent @marthakelner Both the prosecution and the defence teams in this case argued against the release of the footage of this attack, saying it would impact suspect David DePape's right to a fair trial and fuel ""distorted facts"" around the case. But a persistent campaign by news organisations convinced the judge that there was not a compelling reason to keep the footage, 911 call and a portion of a police interview with DePape under wraps. It is, perhaps, no surprise that Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to watch such a brutal attack on her husband of 59 years caught on police body-worn cameras. But the surveillance footage of DePape allegedly wandering around the perimeter of the couple's San Francisco home before breaking in is also eye-opening. Capitol police, charged with protecting the Pelosi family home, were apparently patrolling the property just metres away, seemingly unaware DePape was inside until a 911 call from Paul Pelosi. It has prompted a review of security procedures for high profile politicians.

Police said he told them there was ""evil in Washington"" and that he planned to hold Mrs Pelosi hostage for allegedly lying to the public.

He also believed the discredited theory that the US election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Court documents also reveal he told officers he was on a ""suicide mission"" while in interviews DePape named Tom Hanks as among other targets.

Posters celebrating dead militants are stuck to the walls. Children are everywhere - more than half the population of the camp is under 25.

We were escorted to meet fighters from Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade, one of the largest and oldest militant groups in the West Bank.

They are a proscribed terror group by Israel, the EU and US, but not the UK.

Out front, I turned a corner and they were there - dressed all in black, M16 assault rifles in hand and balaclavas covering their faces.

They are young men, heavily armed and say they are ready to die defending their land.

We made our introductions and then moved down another alleyway - an Israeli military lookout post was on the hill above us; snipers watch every move in the camp below.

""We're seeing an escalation by the [Israeli] occupation forces across camps in the West Bank, especially in Jenin and Balata,"" one of the militants tells me.

""Most of the operations are carried out by the Israeli special forces. Yesterday, two of our men were killed in clashes when they entered inside the camp.""

The fighters are relaxed. This is their stronghold.

Image: A poster of dead militants hangs above a fruit and veg stall

CCTV cameras seem to be everywhere, they joke it's like Paris or London; the militia has its own reconnaissance unit that watches for undercover Israeli special forces entering the camp.

Violent clashes have been more frequent in recent months - 2022 was the deadliest year since 2005 and already 2023, only a few weeks old, is more deadly still.

After nine Palestinians, mostly militants, were killed in an Israeli counter-terror raid on Thursday, the prospect of another all-out war is closer.

One of those killed was a 61-year old woman, Magda Obaid, caught in the crossfire.

The IDF says it's investigating her death, but the list of unexplained civilian fatalities is growing.

""I think because of the policies of the right-wing Israeli government there will be an escalation in the West Bank,"" the militant from Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades predicts.

Talk of a new uprising, a third intifada, which has been so often threatened in recent years, is emerging again.

""Why? There is not any hope among my people. The Palestinian people need hope, small hope for their freedom.""

The deputy mayor of Nablus, Dr Husam Shakhshiris, is more sanguine but equally blunt in his assessment of the current situation.

""It [Nablus] is occupied by the state of Israel. The Israeli army is entering the city everyday,"" he says.

""We have two military camps on top [of the surrounding hills], we have seven settlements surrounding Nablus city connected by bus routes, and it's easy for the Israelis to close the city and prevent the movement in and out of the city.""

As we walk around the city together, Dr Husam is clearly popular. Residents stop to greet him.

Unlike the militants we met, he has the wisdom of age and is thoughtful and considered in his words, but no less damning of Israel.

""How bad is it?"" I ask him.

Image: Nablus's deputy mayor says the current situation is the worst he's ever seen

""This is bad. I see all the time in the past that there was hope to have a peace solution, to have a two-state solution implemented, especially after Oslo,"" says Dr Husam.

""Now we don't see this hope, we don't see a peaceful solution and we are stuck in these contours created by the policies of the state of Israel. They don't see or recognise our national right of self-determination.

""It is the worst situation in my life.""

Violence in Israel and the West Bank goes in cycles.

Right now, any prospect of peace talks, or even a two-state solution, feels a long way off.

Neither side is in the mood to talk or to compromise, and so for many Palestinians fighting seems like the only route to more freedoms.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127191140/http://news.sky.com/story/palestinian-militants-ready-to-die-as-prospect-of-all-out-war-increases-after-west-bank-clashes-12796849

The former health secretary's earnings from his 18-day appearance on the ITV show last year were published in the MPs register of interests on Thursday.

On Friday, his spokesman told Sky News he has given £10,000 of his earnings from the show to the Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk and the British Dyslexia Association.

""That's more than his MP's salary when he was in the jungle,"" the spokesman said.

It is not clear if the £10,000 was evenly split between the two charities.

The amount adds up to 3.13% of the total the West Suffolk MP earned from the programme.

Mr Hancock, who was kicked out of the Tory party for appearing on the show and is now an independent MP, earned the equivalent of £17,777 a day during his jungle stint.

It is not known if the MP will donate any more money to the two charities but the spokesman added: ""He'll definitely be doing more fundraising this year, like he did last year - raising more than £22,000 for the proposed Cambridge Children's Hospital""

Ahead of appearing on the show, Mr Hancock said he signed up to raise awareness of dyslexia, which he was diagnosed with while at Oxford University.

While he was in the jungle, viewers said he was shown speaking for the first time about the learning difficulty two weeks in and mentioned it up to four times after that.

When he announced his appearance, he wrote in The Sun: ""I want to raise the profile of my dyslexia campaign to help every dyslexic child unleash their potential - even if it means taking an unusual route to get there via the Australian jungle.

""I'm A Celebrity is watched by millions of Brits up and down the country.

""I want to use this incredible platform to raise awareness, so no child leaves primary school not knowing if they have dyslexia.""

Following his stint in the jungle, Mr Hancock spoke in parliament about dyslexia during the second reading of the dyslexia screening and teacher training bill, which he tabled to provide universal screening in primary schools and to improve teacher training on the issue.

However, the bill ran out of time to clear its second reading and it is unlikely to progress in its current form.

In early December, Mr Hancock announced he will not be standing at the next general election, due in 2025.

In his letter announcing his intention to the prime minister, he wrote: ""I look forward to championing issues that are dear to my heart, including better support for dyslexic children who get a raw deal from the education system.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127191140/http://news.sky.com/story/matt-hancock-donates-10-000-of-his-320-000-im-a-celeb-fee-to-two-charities-12796936
752;Crack down on fossil fuel lobbyists at COP climate talks, global groups urge the United Nations;Friday 27 January 2023 18:39, UK;['victoria seabrook', '@seabrookclimate'];['cop28', 'climate change'];['groups', 'crack', 'nations', 'lobbyists', 'urge', 'fossil', 'climate', 'cop', 'talks', 'fuel', 'unfccc', 'global', 'oil', 'united', 'uae'];"Fossil fuel lobbyists should be kicked out of the negotiating rooms at the international COP climate talks, global groups have urged the United Nations.

In a letter to the UN and its climate arm, which convenes the annual summit, more than 450 global campaigning organisations said any oil company representative or industry lobbyist should ""not be allowed to unduly influence climate policymaking"".

This allows them to ""weaken and undermine the global response to climate change, and it's why we are on the brink of extinction,"" argue the signatories, which include Greenpeace, Oxfam, Tearfund and Friends of the Earth.

The registration of some 630 delegates with links to fossil fuel companies to attend the last such talks, COP27 in Egypt in November, sparked backlash.

Their presence explains why COP27 ""refused to even formally acknowledge the role that fossil fuels play in the climate crisis,"" said Rachel Rose Jackson, from the campaign to Kick Big Polluters Out, which co-convened the letter.

For example, a battle to commit to phasing down all fossil fuels eventually fell by the wayside, ""even though climate scenarios show there can be no fossil fuel expansion if we are to stay below critical thresholds"", she said.

Campaigners have long demanded that the UN limits the access of fossil fuel executives to the inner negotiating rooms, where government representatives thrash out deals on the collective next steps towards combatting climate change.

But they escalated the demand after the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) appointed an oil company executive as president of this year's talks, COP28 in Dubai at the end of this year.

As COP28 president, Sultan al-Jaber, a government minister who also runs state the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, is supposed to drive the direction of the negotiations, build consensus, and hold laggard governments to account.

His appointment ""threatens the legitimacy and efficacy"" of the conference, they said.

But the COP process is predicated on multilateralism and consensus, and gives all countries an equal seat at the table.

On Tuesday Canada's climate ambassador said it is ""very important"" that COP summits are ""an inclusive process, that everybody has a voice"".

End addiction to fossil fuels - UN chief

The campaigners accept that oil and gas majors should be involved in the discussion, as these companies will have to transform if the world is to stop burning their products.

But they should be limited to the fringes, and the UN's climate body, the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), should finally set up a conflict of interest and accountability process to police their involvement, the campaigners say.

They also acknowledge that boundaries between governments and industry are sometimes blurred, such as in petrostates.

Antonio Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, has spoken increasingly critically of the fossil fuel industry, accusing them of spending more time on averting a PR disaster than a planetary one.

Responding to the appointment of Mr Al-Jaber earlier this month, Mr Guterres's spokesperson said the selection of the host COP and of the COP president is ""a matter for Member States, in which the Secretary-General or the Secretariat of the UNFCCC have absolutely no involvement"".

But they added that humanity is ""losing the battle to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis,"" which can only be averted by ""ending our addiction to fossil fuels"".

The UAE COP28 team has been contacted for comment, while the UNFCCC declined to respond.

Former UK prime minister Tony Blair, who has worked for the UAE government, has backed Mr al-Jaber's appointment and the UAE's presidency.

""The UAE has shown leadership in climate investment and innovation. It is already one of the largest investors in renewables at home and abroad,"" he said earlier this month.

He added: ""It has strong relationships with the Global North and South, East and West, and can be the honest broker needed to raise ambitions and seek real consensus.""

Jake Davison, a trainee crane operator, had assaulted two teenagers in an argument about being called fat in September 2020.

Darren Wood, the partner of Mr Davison's mother Maxine, told an inquest that he was ""raging angry"" and had begun loading his pump-action shotgun after the incident in which he punched a boy and pushed a girl.

""He had come back from the park and they had been taking the p**s out of him,"" Mr Wood told the hearing in Exeter.

""You could see he was angry, and you could feel the anger coming out of him. He came back and ran upstairs. Maxine went upstairs and I could hear him saying, 'I'm going down there [to] kill them'.

""He said he was going to go back to the park and he went to his room to get his gun out the cupboard. I could hear something being loaded.

""Maxine was saying he couldn't take that up the park and she said if he took it up the park he would be getting a jail sentence. She calmed him down.

He added: ""I said to Maxine she should report it but at the end of the day she didn't want me to report it - I wish I had.

""He was an adult and had assaulted a minor and he should have been charged.""

Mr Davison later handed himself into police after CCTV images of a suspect wanted for the assaults were circulated as part of a public appeal.

His firearms certificate and weapon were later seized by police but returned in July the following year - just a few weeks before the deadly shooting in the Newham area of Plymouth.

The court heard that Mr Wood was in a relationship with Mrs Davison from July 2020 and lived with her between August and November 2020 before moving out.

He said the atmosphere in the house was ""tense"" and there were regular arguments between Mr Davison and his mother.

""She was scared of Jake for the best part of her life. He treated her like a slave - it wasn't the mother and son relationship,"" he said.

""It was brutal some of the things I used to see.

""She didn't want him to have the gun. She rang the police up trying to get the gun taken away and trying to get him to sell it.""

Barry Martin, 38, from Fife, sustained serious injuries while fighting a blaze at the historic Jenners building on Rose Street on Monday.

He had been in a critical condition at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh but died today, Police Scotland said.

Four other firefighters were also taken to the hospital for treatment and were subsequently released.

Two were treated for burns and two for smoke inhalation.

A police officer was also treated for smoke inhalation at the hospital and later released.

Superintendent David Robertson, of Edinburgh Division, said: ""Our thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of Barry at this very difficult time.

""Our enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances.""

More than 100 firefighters tackled the blaze, which was reported around 11.30am on Monday.

Witnesses saw a soot-covered firefighter being helped from the building by colleagues.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the death as a ""terrible tragedy"".

""This is dreadfully sad news,"" she tweeted.

""My deepest condolences go to Barry's family, friends and colleagues.

""This is a terrible tragedy for all who loved him - but also a reminder of the selfless courage our firefighters demonstrate in the line of duty each and every day.""

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's interim chief officer said he and his colleagues were ""devastated"" by the death.

Ross Haggart said: ""I speak for the entire service when I say that we are all devastated by the loss of Barry and our thoughts remain with his family, friends and colleagues at this deeply distressing time.

""Both Barry's family and the service have been overwhelmed with the messages of support we have received and we thank everyone for the time they have taken to share these.

""Barry's family would also like to thank all the medical staff who have cared for him.""

Holocaust victims are remembered each year on 27 January - the anniversary of the liberation of the concentration and extermination camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau.

The day is also used to mourn the millions more people who lost their lives under Nazi persecution of other groups.

And millions of other lives which were lost in subsequent genocides in later years in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur are also remembered.

Candles were lit across the UK at 4pm, and a memorial was held at Piccadilly Circus in London.

Thirty artworks of people affected by the Holocaust, genocide, or identity-based persecution were projected on to a digital billboard there.

Pictures taken by the photographer Rankin of genocide survivors were also displayed. And a crowd, including survivors, gathered to pay their respects.

Landmarks including the London Eye, Perth Bridge and Titanic Belfast were lit up in purple later in the day.

At Buckingham Palace, Charles and Camilla met Dr Martin Stern who was taken to Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War as a young boy.

After the candle-lighting ceremony, the King said: ""I hope this will be one way of trying to remember all those poor people who had to suffer such horrors for so many years - and still do.""

Dr Stern, who was born to a Jewish father and non-Jewish mother, survived the Westerbork transit camp in the Netherlands and the Theresienstadt ghetto in northern Bohemia (now in the Czech Republic) after being taken away by officers when he was five.

His father died in a separate camp in 1945, and his mother died due to an infection during childbirth in 1942.

Speaking about the lighting of the candles, he said: ""That is immensely important. The perpetrators would like that we would just forget about it, move on to other things so they get on quietly with doing more of their horrific crimes.

""Lighting a candle publicly is a marker that makes it hard for tyrants and state criminals to perpetuate their mass crimes quietly.""

Antisemitism 'plague' warning

Dr Stern warned against a ""plague"" of antisemitism in the UK.

""There is a plague of it, and it is very sinister, because without centuries of antisemitism, Nazism and the Holocaust would not have occurred,"" he said.

""And the danger is that we are leading to a similar catastrophe.""

Charles and Camilla also met Amouna Adam, from the persecuted Fur tribe, who survived genocide in Darfur in western Sudan, as well as representatives of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.

They discussed ongoing work to make sure the lessons learned during genocides are not forgotten.

Laura Marks, chair of the Holocaust Memorial Day trust, said: ""What the King was able to offer us, to share with us, was his interest in both in the Holocaust, but also, in the other genocides and the work that he's doing.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127215706/http://news.sky.com/story/holocaust-memorial-day-king-and-queen-consort-light-candles-in-remembrance-of-millions-of-victims-12797078

764;Jeremy Hunt championing 'Brexit freedoms' and HS2 muddle shows gap between what government says and what it can actually deliver;Friday 27 January 2023 19:28, UK;['sam coates', '@samcoatessky'];['hs2', 'jeremy hunt', 'rishi sunak'];['muddle', 'money', 'prime', 'mr', 'championing', 'freedoms', 'shows', 'hs2', 'jeremy', 'project', 'deliver', 'projects', 'rail', 'plans', 'gap', 'hunt', 'mps', 'brexit', 'sunak'];"Two stories collided rather unfortunately for the government on Friday, shedding a useful light on the gap between what our leaders claim and the limits of what they are actually able to do.

The first story was Chancellor Jeremy Hunt banging the drum for growth and eulogising about the growth dividend from Brexit. Clearly he had noticed the criticism on both.

The second was the downright muddle over HS2, the high-speed rail link between London and Manchester.

Fourteen years and six prime ministers after the project was first properly mooted, today's prime minister was unable to give the plans his unequivocal backing.

It's been clear something is up with HS2 for about a fortnight. When I asked Rishi Sunak if he backed the existing plans at a question and answer session in Lancashire a week ago, he rushed to the exit without answering. Later the same day, he declined to answer specifical about HS2 again.

Afterwards Number 10 tried to hose down enquiring minds by insisting there were no discussions in government about the subject.

Then on Friday, The Sun produced a leaked report suggesting parts of the route may yet be scrapped, the whole project may be delayed and the final destination of HS2 may become a west London suburb rather than Euston station.

So what does the government say it thinks?

Well, the transport department said this was all speculation, Mr Hunt said ""we are building HS2 and we are going to make it happen"".

Advertisement

However, a spokesman for Number 10 used a tortured yet presumably deliberately complex formulation, referring to the chancellor's backing and saying the PM is ""committed to the integrated rail plan,"" a Johnson-era document about a mish-mash of different high-speed projects and electrification.

Finally, when the PM was asked himself, he talked in broad terms about being committed to rail plans already announced and avoided mentioning HS2 by name despite being pressed on it.

This lack of clarity is all part of a pattern MPs have clocked: one growing critique among Tories is Mr Sunak is never particularly in a hurry to clarify or decide.

Whether on this or the investigation into party chair Nadhim Zahawi, he is giving the impression he likes to take his time, something his colleagues aren't sure he has much of.

There's a bigger issue at play today, however.

Because in truth, Mr Sunak is right: even though so much work has already been done on HS2, he is not in a position to be able to promise that it will be completed according to the current plans.



The prime minister faces two massive constraints of his own making.

The first is that in the Autumn statement his chancellor announced real-terms cuts to the capital budgets - the pots of money for infrastructure which the HS2 budget comes out of.

The government has overcommitted to projects that can be funded from this money, but has not decided which will be axed and which will survive. In this context, no big projects - think Sizewell as well as HS2, for example - can be considered safe. There isn't enough money to go around.

Image: Map shows journey from Old Oak Common to central London

The second constraint is that Mr Sunak is very sensitive to his own backbenchers.

Around 20 Tory MPs are publicly opposed to the project, with senior figures like Sir Graham Brady negotiating to save his constituency from it behind the scenes.

Mr Sunak has signalled he does not even want any vote to be tight, and given it takes just 34 Tory MPs to vote against a government motion to lose, he might not want to push divisions on such an issue to a parliamentary fight.

Lack of money and lack of political clout are the two realities that will continue to constrain Mr Sunak's government.

Business groups were lukewarm about the chancellor's growth speech with Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, saying there was ""very little meat on the bones"".

Tyre Nichols, 29, passed away in hospital three days after the confrontation following a traffic stop in the city of Memphis, Tennessee, on 7 January.

Bodycam footage of the altercation is expected to be released later on Friday evening.

His family said the ""very horrific"" video showed officers savagely beating the FedEx worker for three minutes in an assault their lawyers likened to the Los Angeles police attack on motorist Rodney King in 1991.

Five sacked officers, who are all black, have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, including assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression, over Mr Nichols's death.

Civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who is representing his family, said when the public watches the footage they will see him calling out for his mother.

He said: ""When you all see this video, you're going to see Tyre Nichols calling out for his mum.

""He calls out three times for his mother. His last words on this earth are, 'mum, mum, mum'. He's screaming for her. When you think about that kidnapping charge, he said 'I just want to go home'.""

""It's a traffic stop for God's sake. A simple traffic stop.""

Mr Nichols's mother, RowVaughn Wells, told reporters: ""For a mother to know their child was calling them in their need and I wasn't there for him. Do you know how I feel right now? Because I wasn't there for my son.""

Ms Wells recalled she had ""a really bad pain in my stomach"" and once she found out what happened she realised ""that was my son's pain that I was feeling"".

""For me to find out my son was calling my name, you have no clue how I feel right now,"" she added, struggling to hold back tears.

She also said she had not yet seen the video but urged anyone with children not to let them watch it.

""I have never seen the video but what I have heard is very horrific.""

She added the charged officers had ""disgraced their families"".

""I want to say to the five police officers who murdered my son, you also disgraced your own families when you did this.

""But I am going to pray for you and your families. Because this shouldn't have happened. We want justice for my son.""

She has pleaded for peaceful protests.

Police pulled Mr Nichols over for alleged reckless driving before there was an ""altercation"" where officers used pepper spray on him, according to Shelby County district attorney Steve Mulroy.

Mr Nichols then tried to flee on foot and another altercation followed, he added.

His family say the officers beat him and the injuries he sustained during the encounter led to his death.

Relatives accuse police of causing him to have a heart attack and kidney failure. Authorities have only said he experienced a medical emergency.

The officers were assigned to the 'scorpion' unit which focuses on violent street crime. The family's lawyers want it to be disbanded.

767;Seven dead after shooting at synagogue in Jerusalem, Israeli police say;Saturday 28 January 2023 02:51, UK;['samuel osborne', '@samuelosborne93'];['israel', 'jerusalem'];['synagogue', 'dead', 'say', 'west', 'palestinians', 'seven', 'israeli', 'bank', 'international', 'shooting', 'security', 'jerusalem', 'attack', 'killed'];"Seven people have been killed and several injured in a shooting at a synagogue in Jerusalem, according to Israeli police.

The gunman was shot and killed and a large police presence was at the scene.

Three others were injured in the shooting, including a 15-year-old boy who was recovering from surgery, hospital officials said. The MADA rescue service said the dead were five men and two women, including a 70-year-old woman.

Police said the gunman arrived at around 8.15pm local time (6.15pm UK time) on Friday and described the shooting as a ""terror attack"".

They added it took place in a synagogue in Neve Yaakov, considered by Israelis to be a neighbourhood within Jerusalem, while Palestinians and much of the international community consider it occupied land illegally annexed after the Six-Day War in 1967.

Police said the gunman fled in a car after opening fire and officers gave chase and after an exchange of fire killed him.

He was described as a 21-year-old resident of East Jerusalem who ""carried out the attack at the scene alone"".

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had held a security assessment and decided on ""immediate actions"".

Mr Netanyahu urged people not to take the law into their own hands and said Israel would act with ""determination and composure"".

He said he would convene his Security Cabinet tomorrow night, after the end of the Sabbath, to discuss a further response.

Jerusalem police chief Doron Turjeman promised an ""aggressive and significant"" effort to track down anyone who had helped him.

It comes after a deadly raid by the Israeli military yesterday that killed nine Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. A 10th was later killed north of Jerusalem.

Gaza militants then fired rockets and Israel responded with air strikes overnight. There were no reports of injuries.

Earlier today Palestinians marched in anger as they buried the last of the people killed by Israeli fire.

A spokesperson for the Islamist group Hamas said: ""This operation is a response to the crime conducted by the occupation in Jenin and a natural response to the occupation's criminal actions"", though he stopped short of claiming the attack.

The smaller militant group Islamic Jihad also praised but did not claim the attack.

In Ramallah, the largest city in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, some responded to news of the attack with street gatherings and outbreaks of celebratory gunfire, while outside the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem where some of the wounded were treated crowds chanted ""death to terrorists"".

In a sign of the potential for further escalation, the Palestinian health ministry said three Palestinians were taken to hospital after being shot by an Israeli settler near the northern West Bank city of Nablus.

Without international intervention this situation threatens to spiral out of control Alistair Bunkall Middle East correspondent @AliBunkallSKY This terror attack came hours after the start of Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest, on International Holocaust Memorial Day, and after a violent 48 hours in the West Bank. An attack on a synagogue, with so many Israelis killed, will inflame an already dangerous situation. The controversial far-right politician Itamar Ben-Gvir, now security minister in the new Netanyahu government, visited the scene of the attack and vowed a tough response. Some Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank celebrated the synagogue attack as revenge for Israeli raids in Jenin earlier this week. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due to visit Jerusalem and Ramallah at the start of next week. He will urge de-escalation, but without international intervention, this situation threatens to spiral out of control.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was ""deeply worried"" by the escalation of violence and urged ""utmost restraint"", UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.

UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly condemned the attack, saying: ""To attack worshippers at a synagogue on Holocaust Memorial Day, and during Shabbat, is horrific. We stand with our Israeli friends.""

The US condemned the ""apparent terrorist attack"", with US State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel saying he did not expect changes to Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Israel next week.

768;Moment of hammer attack on Paul Pelosi shown in new police bodycam video;Friday 27 January 2023 22:27, UK;[];['nancy pelosi'];['mr', 'suspect', 'shown', 'husband', 'depape', 'hammer', 'surveillance', 'paul', 'video', 'moment', 'bodycam', 'attack', '911', 'footage', 'pelosi'];"Police bodycam video has been released showing the moment a man attacked Nancy Pelosi's husband with a hammer in his San Francisco home.

Officers knock repeatedly on the front door - when it opens Mr Pelosi is holding the head of the hammer while the intruder is gripping the handle and trying to prise the 82-year-old's hand away.

Mr Pelosi refuses to let go, before the suspect suddenly seizes control and lunges at him with the weapon.

It's at this point Sky News has decided to stop the footage.

Police rush in, jump on the attacker and push him face down on the ground as Mr Pelosi lies motionless next to him.

The 28 October attack knocked Mr Pelosi unconscious and he had surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his arm and hands.

Former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most senior politicians in the US, was David DePape's intended target but was in Washington at the time.

Image: The attack happened at the couple's San Francisco home in October

She said on Friday that she wasn't going to watch the video.

""I have not heard the 911 call. I have not heard the confession. I have not seen the break-in. And I have absolutely no intention of seeing the deadly assault on my husband,"" she said.

Mrs Pelosi said her husband was ""making progress"" but it will ""take more time"".

The video is part of evidence newly released after journalists challenged a decision to keep it out of public view.

It also includes some of Mr Pelosi's 911 call, images from police surveillance cameras and video from DePape's police interview.

The surveillance video shows the suspect using a hammer to smash the glass of a door to get into the house.

DePape, 42, denies all the charges against him. They include attempted kidnapping, attempted murder, elder abuse and burglary.

High profile politicians are likely to be concerned after seeing this footage Martha Kelner US correspondent @marthakelner Both the prosecution and the defence teams in this case argued against the release of the footage of this attack, saying it would impact suspect David DePape's right to a fair trial and fuel ""distorted facts"" around the case. But a persistent campaign by news organisations convinced the judge that there was not a compelling reason to keep the footage, 911 call and a portion of a police interview with DePape under wraps. It is, perhaps, no surprise that Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to watch such a brutal attack on her husband of 59 years caught on police body-worn cameras. But the surveillance footage of DePape allegedly wandering around the perimeter of the couple's San Francisco home before breaking in is also eye-opening. Capitol police, charged with protecting the Pelosi family home, were apparently patrolling the property just metres away, seemingly unaware DePape was inside until a 911 call from Paul Pelosi. It has prompted a review of security procedures for high profile politicians.

Police said he told them there was ""evil in Washington"" and that he planned to hold Mrs Pelosi hostage for allegedly lying to the public.

He also believed the discredited theory that the US election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Court documents also reveal he told officers he was on a ""suicide mission"" while in interviews DePape named Tom Hanks as among other targets.

Immigration officials identified him as a Canadian citizen who was in the US illegally after entering as a visitor.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230127215706/http://news.sky.com/story/moment-of-hammer-attack-on-paul-pelosi-shown-in-new-police-bodycam-video-12796930

Sky News has learnt that major companies including Barratt Developments and Persimmon are preparing for the imminent signing of a legally binding contract with the government that could ultimately cost the industry £5bn or more.

One executive said they expected the final contract to be signed and unveiled as soon as next week, although they cautioned that the timing remained fluid.

Last year, dozens of developers signed a pledge to fix buildings constructed since the early 1990s, with revisions to the deal with government in recent weeks having focused on the scope of companies' exposure.

The City watchdog is thought to have been involved in discussions with the industry about whether signing the contract would require the approval of shareholders in listed companies such as Barratt, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey.

Sources have estimated the cost of the new Residential Property Developers Tax at up to £3bn and the bill for self-remediation at around £2bn.

A further tax on the industry could raise £3bn, industry executives have concluded, leading some companies and investors to warn that the sector risks seeing a flight of capital.

Earlier this month, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said it was ""finalising the legally binding contracts that developers will sign to fix their unsafe buildings, and expect them to do so very soon.

""We will not accept any backsliding on their commitments.

""It is building owners' legal responsibility to make sure that all buildings are safe.""

Image: Many buildings across the UK have been deemed to have unsafe cladding since the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017

FTSE-100 housebuilders have already taken significant financial provisions in their accounts to prepare for the signing of the final government contract.

Some have flagged during recent earnings calls with analysts that they expected an imminent settlement.

""In signing the pledge, we're saying that we essentially had a commitment that we wanted to sign up to the legal agreement,"" David Thomas, Barratt's chief executive, told analysts this month.

"" There's been a process of discussion regarding the legal agreement that has been ongoing since June last year, so we think we're getting close to the government publishing the legal agreement, and we would expect in due course that we would sign up to that.""

""We have been working constructively with government to ensure the detailed contract reflects the commitments of the pledge and we await a final version.

""UK housebuilders are taking responsibility and are well progressed with remediating their own buildings and are already paying another £3bn to fund work on buildings built by foreign companies and others.

Sir Jake Berry, who was chair under Liz Truss, said Mr Sunak should have held an ""endorsement vote"" to show he had the support of the membership.

Instead, Mr Sunak automatically became PM after Boris Johnson and Penny Mordaunt dropped out of the contest to replace Liz Truss and Mr Sunak passed the 100-nomination threshold, leaving him as the only remaining candidate.

As a result, there is a ""perception"", Sir Jake said, that Tory MPs are ""disconnected from our membership"".

Mr Sunak entered Downing Street just weeks after coming second to Ms Truss in the summer leadership contest after Tory members voted for her over him - despite MPs being in favour of him.

""I actually think it's a great pity for Rishi Sunak that we didn't have a vote of members,"" Sir Jake told GB News.

""Because in the summer, fine Conservative that he is, he struggled actually to get the support of Conservative Party members - as, funnily enough, did Jeremy Hunt in the previous leadership election.

Image: Sir Jake Berry was party chairman under Liz Truss

""And I think even though he absolutely got the majority of the Conservative members of parliament - and I support him as prime minister in everything he does - the challenge he has is, even if it's not true, there's a perception of the Conservative Parliamentary Party now being disconnected from our membership.""

'War room' in the dying days of Truss leadership

The former Northern Powerhouse minister revealed what the last days of the Truss premiership were like.

He was part of a ""war room"" in Number 10, with Ms Truss, ex-chief whip Wendy Morton and former deputy PM Therese Coffey who were all trying to stabilise her leadership after the now-infamous mini-budget.

The footage shows police savagely beating the 29-year-old FedEx worker for three minutes while screaming profanities at him throughout the attack.

Police have released four separate videos cut into one hour-long clip.

Memphis police chief Cerelyn Davis told reporters it was from ""three different streams"".

She said: ""It's three different sources: body-worn camera, an actual source right there at the scene where the most physical you know abuse occurred and then two other body-worn cameras from the officers at that same scene.""

Ms Davis had earlier asked for calm before the video footage was made public.

""I expect you to feel what the Nichols family feels,"" she said. ""I expect you to feel outrage in the disregard of basic human rights.""

In the footage, one camera shows the initial police stop at an intersection in Memphis, Tennessee.

""I'm going to baton the (expletive) out you,"" one officer can be heard saying. His body camera shows him raise his baton while at least one other officer holds Mr Nichols.

After the first officer roughly pulls Mr Nichols out of his car, the FedEx worker can be heard saying ""I didn't do anything"" as a group of officers begins to wrestle him to the ground.

""Get on the ground!,"" one officer yells, as another is heard yelling: ""Tase him! Tase him!""

Image: Tyre Nichols is seen beaten by police officers in video released by Memphis Police Department

The father-of-one calmly replied soon after being wrestled to the pavement: ""OK, I'm on the ground.""

Moments later, as the officers continue to yell, Mr Nichols says: ""Man, I am on the ground.""

An officer yells: ""Put your hands behind your back before I break your (expletive).""

Moments later, an officer yells: ""(Expletive), put your hands behind your back before I break them.""

""You guys are really doing a lot right now,"" Mr Nichols says loudly to the officers. ""I'm just trying to go home.""

""Stop, I'm not doing anything,"" he yells moment later.

Nichols heard calling for his mother as police attack him

The camera is briefly obscured and then Mr Nichols can be seen running as an officer fires a Taser at him. The officers then start chasing Mr Nichols.

After the beating, officers milled about for several minutes while Mr Nichols lay propped up against the car, then slumped onto the street.

In footage from one of the cameras Mr Nichols is heard shouting for his mother while police attack him.

Mr Nichols is then pepper-sprayed and punched in the face.

'A heinous, reckless and inhumane' attack

Ms Davis said the officers were ""already ramped up, at about a 10"" during the initial stop.

She added the officers were ""aggressive, loud, using profane language and probably scared Mr Nichols from the very beginning"".

""We know something happened prior to this officer or these officers getting out of their vehicles... just knowing the nature of officers, it takes something to get them amped up, you know, like that. We don't know what happened,"" she said.

""All we know is the amount of force that was applied in this situation was over the top.""

Image: Tyre Nichols

Ms Davis also described the officers' actions as ""heinous, reckless and inhumane,"" and said that her department has been unable to substantiate the reckless driving allegation that prompted the stop.

Demonstrator says 'they killed a man that looked like me'

Protests are taking place in at least nine cities across the US in the hours since the bodycam footage was released.

Mr Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, had earlier warned supporters of the ""horrific"" nature of the video but pleaded for peace saying ""tearing up the streets"" is ""not what my son stood for"".

Demonstrations are taking place in Sacramento in California, Washington DC, Atlanta in Georgia, Boston in Massachusetts, New York, Asheville in North Carolina, Philadelphia in Pennsylvania and Providence in Rhode Island.

A demonstration organised by Black Lives Matter are also taking place in Memphis, Tennessee, where Mr Nichols was attacked.

Sky's US correspondent James Matthews, who is at the demonstration, asked one protester how she felt when she saw the video.

She replied: ""It was heartbreaking, very very difficult to watch. It was just heartbreaking that's all I can say.""

A man who was attending the protest in Memphis told Sky News: ""(The attack was) unprofessional, not police-like, I don't agree with that.

""That's why I am down here now. That was disgusting to me.""

A second man said: ""I was very sad about the situation and I'm praying for Tyre Nichols' family. I'm very upset about the video, it was disturbing, they killed a man that looked like me.

""Being a black man in this country is hard, we came here as slaves and feel like there is still slavery, feel like we will never escape it.

""Being a black man is hard, traffic stops, going to the mall, you're being watched, you're being filmed.

""Being a black man is hard.""

Meanwhile, police in New York City have made at least three arrests at a protest near Times Square.

One arrest was for damage to a police car, a second was for punching a police officer and a third was for an undisclosed reason, a police captain told NBC News.

Police are also documenting any damage to other vehicles as protesters weave through cars. They also confiscated bikes from protesters who were trying to prevent arrests from being made.

Given the likelihood of protests, Ms Davis had told ABC that she and other local officials decided it would be best to release the video later in the day, after schools were dismissed and people were home from work.

Biden says he is 'outraged' and 'deeply pained'

New York Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer, said he and other mayors across the country had been briefed by the White House in advance of the video's release, which he said would ""trigger pain and sadness in many of us. It will make us angry"".

FBI Director Christopher Wray said he was ""appalled"" by the video and that all FBI field officers have been alerted to work with state and local partners, including in Memphis, ""in the event of something getting out of hand"".

US President Joe Biden said in a statement after the footage was released: ""Like so many, I was outraged and deeply pained to see the horrific video of the beating that resulted in Tyre Nichols' death. It is yet another painful reminder of the profound fear and trauma, the pain, and the exhaustion that black and brown Americans experience every single day.

""My heart goes out to Tyre Nichols' family and to Americans in Memphis and across the country who are grieving this tremendously painful loss.""

He added: ""Violence is never acceptable; it is illegal and destructive. I join Mr Nichols' family in calling for peaceful protest.""

Tyre Nichols's final words move us to ask important questions James Matthews US correspondent @jamesmatthewsky Sometimes, there are no words. Articulating the loss of a son can stretch the vocabulary in the best of times. The family of Tyre Nichols find themselves in the absolute worst. What words can convey how it feels to have a son, your son, battered to death on camera? As hard as anyone tried at a news conference inside Mount Olive Cathedral in Memphis, maybe the job was done best by Tyre himself. At the end of the video, he is heard to call out for his mother, three times. This, a mummy’s boy who had her name tattooed on his arm. They are his final words on footage that shows him becoming limp, unconscious and clearly in distress. He was surrounded by police and other medical specialists who stood back rather than stepped in. His final words were a plea to someone he knew would help, his mum, who lived three blocks from where he was beaten. RowVaughn, Tyre's mother, wasn't aware of it until it emerged on the video. She only knows now because she's been told - she can't bring herself to watch the images. ""You have no clue how I feel,"" she told a news conference when asked about her son calling out for her. And, of course, we don't. But we are asked to consider how we would feel - by the sense of helplessness and lack of humanity aggravated by the desperate cry of a grown man to his mother. It helps an audience empathise, as well as sympathise, and that's important amidst the demands for change. The case of Tyre Nichols moves us to ask important questions around police culture in the United States.

Mr Biden also said he spoke with Mr Nichols' mother and stepfather.

He continued: ""There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a beloved child and young father. Nothing can bring Mr Nichols back to his family and the Memphis community.

Before it was made public, Mr Nichols' family said the ""very horrific"" footage showed officers savagely beating the FedEx worker for three minutes in an assault their lawyers likened to the Los Angeles police attack on motorist Rodney King in 1991.

Five sacked officers, who are all black, have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, including assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression, over Mr Nichols' death.

They are named Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr, Emmitt Martin III, Tadarrius Bean and Justin Smith.

776;'I was going to cut his throat': Ex-criminal enforcer turned bishop reveals how he planned to kill rapist;Saturday 28 January 2023 02:42, UK;['david mercer', '@davidmercersky'];['cost of living', 'lancashire'];['reveals', 'rapist', 'kill', 'felt', 'went', 'id', 'planned', 'excriminal', 'throat', 'man', 'william', 'enforcer', 'turned', 'life', 'cut', 'mick', 'pastor', 'going'];"""I should have been dead many times,"" says Pastor Mick Fleming.

The 57-year-old has survived several attempts on his life after working as an enforcer for the criminal underworld.

He narrowly avoided being killed in a drive-by shooting when he felt bullets ""whizz"" past his body. ""I think that was the closest I came to be being murdered,"" Mick tells Sky News.

He also survived his own attempt to kill himself when he pointed a gun at his head, pulled the trigger but the weapon failed to fire.

""I dropped the gun and I cried,"" he says.

""It was the first time I'd cried since I was little boy.""

After years of violence and drug use, Mick says he had grown to ""despise"" himself.

He suffered two traumatic events growing up in Burnley, Lancashire, that sent his life spiralling into crime and substance abuse.

Aged 11, he says he was raped by a stranger in a park as he walked to school.

""I felt a hand over my mouth and I was dragged into this bandstand,"" Mick says.

""I was petrified. I still sometimes think about it. It hasn't gone away.""

The next day, Mick was told his 20-year-old sister Ann had suffered a heart attack and died in her father's arms.

""My dad came through the front door and shouted: 'Come down, your sister's dead',"" he says.

""It was cold and blunt… then he broke down. He was a tough guy my dad, but a nice man. I'd never seen him cry.""

Life of crime

Mick says he went ""inward"" and started imagining carrying out crimes like pickpocketing ""to escape the real world"".

Soon after, he started stealing and dealing drugs as a teenager before working as an enforcer collecting debts for criminals.

He admits there was ""a lot of violence"" and that his family described him as ""demonic"" at that time. It was not until 2009 that his life changed.

Image: Mick says he spent years dealing with drug abuse

Armed with a gun wrapped in a plastic bag, Mick went to collect a debt from a man outside a gym. But when he walked towards his target, he realised the man was holding hands with two little girls - and there appeared to be ""light shining off their hands"".

""It was a really surreal moment,"" he says. ""I felt sick. I started to cough and splutter and I couldn't see.

""I felt this thing in the pit of my stomach. It was a horrible, dark feeling - like a sickness.

""I got back in the car and drove round the corner into this little industrial unit and pulled over. I was throwing my guts up. There was blood everywhere. I looked like I'd been stabbed.""

Image: Mick was an enforcer for the criminal underworld

It was at this point that Mick tried to shoot himself. After he failed, he was later admitted to a psychiatric unit.

""I've never had a drink or used drugs since,"" Mick says. ""I was on a road to recovery from that point on.""

Meeting his rapist - and the plan to kill him

Mick had been clean of drink and drugs for about a year when he says, by chance, he met the man who raped him.

He spotted his attacker in a McDonald's restaurant. The man was drunk and Mick bought him a cup of tea.

""I knew it was him,"" Mick says. ""He didn't know it was me.""

Mick arranged to meet the man the next day with the intention of killing him.

""I went back with a knife in my sock,"" he says.

""I was going to cut his throat. I was going to kill him. Everything was building up inside me.""

Image: Mick Fleming is known locally as Pastor Mick

As Mick walked towards the man, he says he imagined killing him, with ""clear, vivid pictures"" of the brutal act in his mind.

But instead of carrying it out, Mick says he sat down and listened to what the man had to say.

""I didn't say anything,"" Mick explains. ""In that moment I got this real understanding. I thought: 'I'm not going to live in your sin.'

""People say resentment is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. That's what I'd been doing.

""I didn't grow to love the guy but, in the end, I can honestly say I didn't hate him.""

Mick says the man died about two years later.

Becoming a priest

After leaving the psychiatric unit, Mick went on to achieve a degree in theology from the University of Manchester, overcoming difficulties he faced with dyslexia.

Now ordained as a priest and recently consecrated as a bishop, he is known locally as Pastor Mick and runs a charity called Church On The Street, helping people struggling in the cost of living crisis.

Among its services, the charity provides food, mental health support and Citizens' Advice - and has recently had to start helping families pay for funerals.

""At the moment, it's far, far worse than the pandemic,"" he says. ""It's ordinary people with children who are in dire straits.""

He is also concerned about the impact of the cost of living on mental health and suicide risk.

""I've got NHS mental health teams working with us in our building. People can't afford to have a funeral for their loved ones. It's horrendous. We pay an undertaker to do the funerals for us and then I do the services for free.""

Image: William and Kate met Pastor Mick during a visit to his charity last year

Meeting William and Kate

Mick's work was recognised by royalty when Prince William and Kate visited the charity in January last year.

William has since written the foreword to Mick's book - with a TV series about his life in the works - and he was invited to Kate's Christmas carol concert in December.

""I got to pray for them which was quite an honour,"" Mick says. ""I really felt they're going to need prayers.""

Mick believes William and Kate understand the problems people are facing with the cost of living despite their royal lifestyles.

""Obviously they haven't experienced it but you don't have to dead to be an undertaker, do you?"" he says.

""They've got the ability to open doors and ask questions that need to be asked and point fingers in right directions.""

Prince William wrote foreword to Pastor Mick's autobiograpy The Prince of Wales wrote the foreword to Pastor Mick’s autobiography entitled Blown Away: From drug-dealer to life bringer. In it, the future King said: ""It’s impossible to visit Church on the Street and not be deeply moved by the work the organisation does for those in need. ""It is an extraordinary place that has been an important refuge and place of safety for so many. ""Often, it is only by sharing our problems and being honest with ourselves that we are able to heal and overcome life’s challenges. ""And by doing so, we find just how deep the bonds we all share are.""

Mick - who was married with three children during his time as a criminal enforcer - says he has repaired relationships with his family over the years.

""I wasn't a good father,"" he says. ""I have to live with that fact.

""I'd want it to be better with my children, that's the truth. But it's all right - my family have come to accept me, and love me, and care for me. It's the best I can do.

""Some of it is my regret around my children. I wish I could turn the clock back with that but I can't so I accept it and do the best with it.""

777;Andrew Tate: Snapshot of controversial influencer's potential earnings revealed;Saturday 28 January 2023 03:15, UK;['sanya burgess', '@sanyaburgess'];['andrew tate', 'data and forensics'];['revealed', 'figure', 'earnings', 'andrew', 'sky', 'tate', 'sale', 'controversial', 'tates', 'snapshot', 'video', 'potential', 'website', 'views', 'influencers', 'rumble', 'social'];"Influencer Andrew Tate gained many of his millions of followers by telling them he's rich - and he'll make them rich too.

The self-proclaimed misogynist has gone from posing on yachts and filming himself jetting off to Dubai, to being arrested in December over allegations of being part of an organised crime group, human trafficking and rape.

Symbols of Tate's apparent wealth, including luxury cars and properties, have been seized by the Romanian police who are investigating Tate, 36, and his brother and business partner, Tristan, 34.

Image: Luxury cars were seized in a case against Andrew Tate

So, with Tate's assets under the microscope, what is known about how much money his business actually makes?

Speculation about his wealth varies wildly and many of the claims Tate makes about his earnings are unverified, including six-figure sums connected to his ""camgirl"" business.

It is not known whether this business is connected to the charges facing the brothers and two Romanian women, all of whom deny the claims made against them.

Using publicly available information, Sky News has looked at how much his company might be making through video streaming, as well as selling subscriptions and merchandise.

Video streaming

Banned from Twitter in 2017 (but since reinstated in November 2022), Tate was also removed from YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok in August 2022 for breaching their terms and conditions. But he had already built up millions of followers on each platform.

His army of fans followed him to anti-""cancel culture"" streaming platform Rumble, where Tate's associates continue to post clips while he is in prison. Rumble's emphasis on ""free speech"" has made it popular among right-wing commenters.

Tate claims he signed a $9m (£7.3m) deal with Rumble in 2022, according to CNN. Rumble did not reply to Sky News' request for comment, but issued a statement to CNN calling for the charges against Tate to be ""investigated promptly and thoroughly"".

Sky News has collated Tate's video streams from his two Rumble channels, TateSpeech and TateConfidential. The former saw higher video views more consistently after he was blocked by other social media sites.

Although TateConfidential is less successful, the two channels collectively mean Tate has amassed huge viewing figures.

Rumble advertises itself as offering some of the most generous amounts paid out per video view, saying that ""1,000 views on Rumble.com may earn you as much as 10,000 views on YouTube"".

Sara McCorquodale, chief executive and founder of influencer intelligence CORQ, explains that how much social platforms usually pay out tends to be ""a bit of a grey area"".

""[On Rumble] it could be anything from $0.30 to $20 or $50 per 1,000 views,"" she said.

""Andrew Tate could be making anything from $600 (£490) to $20,000 (£16,250) for his most prolific videos.""

By this estimate, Tate's most popular video ""EMERGENCY MEETING 1 - THE MATRIX ATTACKS"", which was broadcast five months ago in the days after he was banned from other social platforms could have earned him up to $133,500 (£108,400) after hitting 2.67m views.

As well as earning money through adverts, Rumble gives creators a bonus if their video is hosted on the site's front page.

Mrs McCorquodale explained that Tate's potential earnings on Rumble show just how large his following is, despite the influencer not having access to most mainstream social media sites.

She said: ""It shows the numbers of views we are seeing on Andrew's channels are all coming from his audience.

""This is quite worrying because it shows the scale at which he has attracted people to his narrative.

""Andrew Tate is very much aiming his content at young men... He tries to be aspirational, but then he also tries to connect with young men by seemingly understanding the challenges they face in society today.""

Manosphere merchandise

With Tate banned from most social media, his fans flock to his website - including to buy merchandise to support him.

Activity on his merchandise page has been saved by the Internet Archive project, a digital library of websites. Its records can not be edited or altered.

Using it, we can see how many items were advertised as for sale, at what price and on what date they were listed as having sold out by.

A screenshot of Tate's online merchandise store on 22 October shows that a T-shirt named ""Resist the Slave Mind"" was on sale.

It shows Andrew Tate dressed like a character from the 1999 film The Matrix while holding a red pill. The red pill, a motif from the movie, is popular symbol in what is known as the ""manosphere"", a loosely connected groups of online misogynists.

The now sold-out shirts were on sale for $100 (£81) each with 1,000 in stock.

This means the T-shirts would have brought in $100,000 (£81,000) of revenue. This is the overall figure earned and would not include any outgoings or division of profit.

These calculations are being made based on figures provided by Tate's website.

These figures may be unreliable, with Sky News discovering that at least one claim on the site is wrong.

Tate's website claims the Resist the Slave Mind T-shirt sold out in the specific timeframe of 25hrs 19m and 43 seconds.

However, archived pages show the T-shirt on sale on 22 October, was still on sale on 5 November and was listed as sold out by 7pm the following day.

This means the T-shirt was on sale for more than two weeks, rather than just over a day.

Other sales on his site recorded by the archive include another T-shirt named ""Vision"". It was put on sale for $100 (£81) per shirt with 651 listed as available, earning a potential $65,100 (£52,700).

A hoodie, ""Cobra"", was on sale for $150 (£120) but the internet archive did not record how many units were available.

A pair of mugs were on sale for $139 (£113) with 888 on offer, potentially generating $123,400 (£100,000).

This means, since the end of October, $265,100 (£215,000) may have been generated through merchandise alone - not including the $150 hoodies, of which we don't have a verifiable stock figure for.

Tate also sells supplements on his website, priced at $54.99 (£44.50).

We don't have stock figures to access through the archive, but data provided to Sky News from website analytics company SimilarWeb can give us an insight.

They estimate that the number of hits on the checkout page for supplements in November was around 6,500 and in December around 3,100. While a person visiting the checkout page does not guarantee a sale is made, it does give a sense of how many users are getting to that stage of the purchasing process.

Money-making memberships

Tate sells access to schemes that are advertised as teaching people how to make money online through sessions on skills such as copywriting and crypto-trading.

This is ""a classic influencer strategy"" that Andrew Tate has put his own spin on, says Mrs McCorquodale.

""The clever thing Andrew Tate has done is recognise that he is a divisive character. Many people may not want to be seen as a fan of him publicly but are buying his subscriptions and engaging privately.

""His subscriptions allow people to engage without risk of judgement. This is crucial.""

There are two levels of access. The first is ""The Real World"", a new incarnation of the Hustler's University, which was shut down last year.

Subscribers pay $49.99 (£40) a month for access to group chat rooms, tutorials and ""millionaire mentors"". For those signing up early, an entry fee of $27 (£22) was payable, which later increased to $147 (£120).

The website claims over 200,000 people have transferred over from Hustler's University or joined the scheme when it launched in November. This would bring in at least $9,998,000 (£8,089,140) a month in subscriptions if that figure is accurate.

However, Sky News has seen a Telegram group for The Real World where members of Hustler's University were automatically added. It only has 126,255 subscribers.

The number of views each announcement in the group gets has dropped from around 230,000 at the start to around 45,000 in January.

Web traffic to the log in page for The Real World is also much lower than the membership figure would suggest.

Less than 100,000 hits were registered by VStat, another web traffic monitor, in January. The service is unable to give a more precise audience figure when views are this low.

Tate's other subscription service is The War Room, where membership is significantly more expensive, at $5,454 (£4,400), which must be paid via cryptocurrency.

It is not possible to find a reliable independent figure which could indicate how many people are subscribed to The War Room.

Sky News contacted Tate's lawyer for comment regarding the figures set out in this article but did not receive a response.

What can we learn from this snapshot of Tate's earnings?

For Mrs McCorquodale, Sky News' findings goes some of the way towards answering if these earnings tally with Tate's displays of wealth.

""What's clear is he has multiple revenue streams which all link back to him monetising his digital audience and mean he is less reliant on mainstream social media platforms,"" she said.

""These let him continually push a message and amass more new customers but ultimately he is trying to get them off those platforms and onto his own [such as] his War Room subscription.""

The future of Tate's earnings may well be hit by the police investigation, with Mrs McCorquodale highlighting the falling viewing figures on Rumble after his arrest.

She said: ""Many people may like what he's saying and think the controversy around him is overblown. But the minute there is a chance he might actually be a criminal, they're out.

""Perhaps this has made consumers review more carefully who he is and his real impact beyond making people annoyed on Twitter.""

778;Adam Boulton: Long Johnson is still plaguing the Tories - Sunak needs to take decisive action;Saturday 28 January 2023 02:47, UK;['adam boulton', '@adamboultontabb'];[];['prime', 'sharp', 'boris', 'minister', 'johnson', 'sunak', 'tories', 'adam', 'action', 'long', 'plaguing', 'zahawi', 'decisive', 'boulton', 'cabinet', 'way', 'needs'];"Those worried about the health of British politics have diagnosed a new disease at Westminster.

Chris Patten, a grandee from the Conservative establishment, spotted what he called ""Long Boris"" last summer.

Weeks after Boris Johnson announced his resignation as prime minister, Lord Patten, a former party chairman and former BBC chairman, lamented the persistent ""corrupting and debilitating impact of Johnson's premiership on British politics and government.""

As with 'SARS-Covid-19' there was some debate as to how the condition should be named in general conversation.

Eventually, ""Long Johnson"" was settled on rather than the more familiar ""Long Boris"".

The commentator Paul Waugh listed some of the symptoms of Long Johnson he saw in the bloodstream of the Conservative party: ""A debilitating condition that led it to lose its sense of taste, decency and direction.""

Long Johnson hit fever pitch with the Conservative party's short-lived collective decision to select Johnson's preferred candidate, Liz Truss, as the next prime minister. That quickly burnt itself out.

Westminster Accounts: Search for your MP

On taking office Rishi Sunak tried to shake off Long Johnson by promising that his government would be one of ""integrity, professionalism and accountability"" at all times. It is not proving so easy for the new prime minister to escape unwanted legacies from his predecessor-but-one.

Questions of probity over two men who were promoted by Johnson, Nadhim Zahawi and Richard Sharp, have combined to create the biggest political crisis of Sunak's short premiership.

According to Raphael Behr, political columnist on The Guardian, the ""Zahawi episode is a symptom of Long Johnson, the chronic, recurrent, debilitation of government by a pathogen that still circulates in the ruling party long after the original infection has been treated"".

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 7:03 Analysis: Labour says PM 'too weak'

The embarrassments Sunak is grappling with are debilitating hangovers from the Johnson era, so is the fumbling way the prime minister is dealing with them.

Nadhim Zahawi had the reputation at Westminster of a comparatively competent and personable minister, one of those credited with the successful roll-out of the vaccine programme. But as often with politicians who become conspicuously wealthy there was much gossip about his finances.

His wealth was generated as a co-founder of the polling company YouGov before he became an MP.

Scrutiny of Zahawi's finances sharpened when he became Chancellor of the Exchequer, the politician responsible for the nation's finances and tax system. In seeking the truth, journalists received what they considered to be aggressive threats of libel from lawyers acting for Zahawi, designed to suppress allegations, some of which have been confirmed as accurate.

It is now known that while he was Chancellor, Zahawi quietly negotiated a tax settlement totalling some £5m, including a penalty of more than £1m, with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for which he was the minister responsible.

Zahawi says his mistake was ""careless but not deliberate"". Jim Harra, the head of HMRC, told MPs this week: ""There are no penalties for innocent errors in your tax affairs.""

There is no pressing reason why Boris Johnson should have made Zahawi chancellor. Nor does the haste with which the appointment was made suggest that the prime minister or his officials, led by the Cabinet Secretary, had sufficient time for due diligence looking into his suitability for this most sensitive financial post. Yet their green light then effectively gave him a free pass to prominent ministerial ranks under both Truss and Sunak.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:01 'Questions need answering' in Zahawi case

By late last year scrutiny by an honours committee elsewhere in Whitehall reportedly held up a proposed knighthood for Zahawi.

In the past, when serving prime ministers have announced their intention to resign, other ministers have stayed in post until the successor is chosen. He or she then assembles their own cabinet team. This has been so even when threatened ministerial resignations force out a prime minister, as happened to both Tony Blair and Boris Johnson.

Once he announced he was going, Johnson could have said that he was not accepting resignations and that all minsters would stay on in the interim. That is not the way Boris Johnson behaved. He used his dying powers of patronage to settle scores and to try to influence the outcome of the leadership election.

He fired Michael Gove and then he troubled the ailing Queen to appoint an entirely new temporary cabinet for the few weeks of the leadership contest. Johnson promoted Zahawi to the Treasury, thus crucially depriving Rishi Sunak of the status of high office during the leadership battle, while Truss luxuriated in the great office of state of foreign secretary.

Earlier, after Sunak emerged as the person most likely to replace Johnson, he became the subject of damaging leaks about his US Green Card and his wife's non-dom status. The Metropolitan Police coincidentally tarnished the teetotal Sunak's reputation, and blunted the impact on Johnson, by issuing them both with fixed penalty notices for breaking COVID regulations at the ""ambushed with a cake"" Johnson birthday party in the cabinet room.

Sunak experienced the hard way the phenomenon, now hitting Zahawi and Sharp, that friendship with Johnson often has adverse consequences.

Richard Sharp insists that he was appointed the chairman of the BBC on merit after a rigorous selection process. There is no reason to doubt his perspective. When I knew him at university, more than 40 years ago, he was an exceptionally decent and considerate person. He went on to build a highly successful career in finance alongside generous voluntary contributions to public service and charity.

Men with known political affiliations such as Michael Grade, Gavyn Davies and Marmaduke Hussey have been appointed to the BBC chair by other prime ministers. But Boris Johnson made the final decision over Sharp, after he and his allies had previously broken with precedent by conjuring up culture wars and pre-endorsing friends and allies such as Paul Dacre and Charles Moore for top posts in the media, normally viewed as apolitical - unsuccessfully it turned out.

Johnson used his patronage to appoint Peter Cruddas to the House of Lords, someone who had helped him out with his personal finances. Richard Sharp says he ""simply connected"" people, who then facilitated an undeclared personal £800,000 overdraft guarantee for the prime minister.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 7:18 Zahawi should 'stand aside'

Richard Sharp and cabinet secretary Simon Case may genuinely have decided this was immaterial to Sharp's BBC application but is that the way Boris Johnson sees things? Several enquiries into Sharp's appointment are now under way. Johnson's benefactor Sam Blyth is an old friend of Sharp.

The inquiries will doubtless ascertain whether Boris Johnson knew of this obliging distant cousin's existence before Sharp introduced him to the cabinet secretary.

Long Johnson is also evident in the way the government is handling these potential scandals.

Quick resignations and moving on are things of the past. Following a pattern which became familiar during the Johnson era, Sunak has presided over, and sometimes joined in, denials that have turned out to be inaccurate, playing for time by calling for further inquiries after awkward facts are established.

Sir Keir Starmer had a two-pronged attack at PMQs: ""We all know why the prime minister was reluctant to ask his party chair questions about family finances and tax avoidance, but his failure to sack him, when the whole country can see what is going on, shows how hopelessly weak he is.""

Sizeable minorities in parliament and perhaps even more in the Tory membership are not loyal to Sunak and hanker for a return of Johnson. This limits Sunak's ability to lead firmly.

With his oblique reference to the great wealth of Sunak's family, the leader of the opposition went further, implying that the prime minister is really just one of them - sharing similar values, or the absence of them, to Johnson and Zahawi and the same acquisitiveness.

Only urgent decisive action by Sunak can demonstrate that he has beaten the plague of Long Johnson.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128035218/http://news.sky.com/story/adam-boulton-long-johnson-is-still-plaguing-the-tories-sunak-needs-to-take-decisive-action-12796446

Want to know your Everything Everywhere All At Once (Oscars frontrunner, with 11 nominations), from your All Quiet On The Western Front (BAFTAs frontrunner, with 14 nods)? And more importantly, how to watch them?

Here's our guide to this year's Oscar and BAFTA nominees - and where you can see them ahead of the ceremonies. Note, some films may be included with streaming packages, others you might have to pay extra to rent, depending on your subscription.

EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE

A word-of-mouth and critically acclaimed hit, Everything Everywhere All At Once leads the Oscars race and is the bookies' favourite to win best picture; stars Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Jamie Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu are also up for acting gongs, too.

Directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, collectively known as Daniels, the film is billed as ""a hilarious and big-hearted sci-fi action adventure about an exhausted Chinese-American woman (Yeoh) who can't seem to finish her taxes"". Oh, and she also discovers parallel universes and has to prevent a powerful being from destroying the multiverse.

Following its release in cinemas Everything Everywhere All At Once is now available to stream on Paramount+, Apple TV, Google Play and Amazon Prime Video.

ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT

A German-language film based on the renowned 1929 novel by Erich Maria Remarque, All Quiet On The Western Front leads the BAFTA nominations - equalling Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon's record as the most nominated foreign film in the history of the awards - and gained nine nods at the Oscars, too.

It's a hard watch, telling the story of a young German soldier on the Western Front of the First World War; how the initial euphoria of war turns into desperation and fear as he and his comrades fight for their lives, and each other, in the trenches.

You can watch All Quiet On The Western Front on Netflix.

THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN

Set on a remote imaginary island off the Irish Coast in the 1920s, The Banshees Of Inisherin reunites In Bruges stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson and tells a darkly comic story of a friendship gone wrong; Gleeson's character decides he's sick to the teeth of his needy friend and doesn't want to waste any more time chatting to him - and raises the stakes by threatening to chop off a finger every time his dull pal tries to strike up a conversation.

The film has led to huge Irish success so far this awards season, with Farrell, Gleeson and their co-stars Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan all nominated for Oscars in the acting categories, and Martin McDonagh (also the man behind In Bruges) up for best director.

Following its cinema release in October 2022, The Banshees of Inisherin is now available to stream on Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu.

TOP GUN: MAVERICK

A box office smash that fans had been waiting for for more than 35 years, the Top Gun sequel was one of a host of blockbusters (more below) that saw the big-hitters returning to the Academy Awards. Nominated for best picture, while it's unlikely to take the top prize, it's nice to see a bit more fun injected into awards season.

Of course, the sequel sees Tom Cruise return as Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, back to train newbies to be as brilliant in the skies as he is. Treading a delicate balance between old and new, there are plenty of throwbacks to please fans of the original.

No doubt the big Top Gun fans will have seen it already at the cinema, but for those who haven't, you can catch it on Sky from 5 February, as well as on Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video.

ELVIS

Following Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman, it was only a matter of time before we got a new Elvis biopic. The 2022 film stars Austin Butler in the titular role, and tells the music icon's story from childhood to music and movie star in the 1950s, and his complex relationship with his manager, Colonel Tom Parker (played by Tom Hanks).

Written and directed by Baz Luhrmann, it's in the running for eight Oscars, including best actor and best picture, while Mandy Walker is the only woman nominated for cinematography.

Elvis is available on Sky, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Google Play and Hulu.

TAR

Cate Blanchett stars as the fictional renowned conductor Lydia Tar, who is days away from recording the symphony that will elevate her career.

She's favourite to win best actress - and if Oscars are given out based on hard work, after learning to play piano on screen, speak fluent German and how to lead a live orchestra, she probably deserves it. If she wins, she can add it to the two Oscars she has already - for Blue Jasmine and The Aviator.

Tar is available to rent on Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV.

THE FABELMANS

As arguably the most famous director in the world, Steven Spielberg's cultural impact is unmatched - from Jaws and ET to war epics Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, his films have imprinted on generation after generation for decades.

However, his latest film, The Fabelmans, is something a little different; a semi-autobiographical story loosely based on his childhood. As well as being a family drama, it portrays the anti-semitic abuse the young Spielberg faced.

The Fabelmans is available to rent or buy on Prime Video and Apple TV.

James Cameron's mega-budget Avatar sequel opened in cinemas in December, 13 years after the original had us all reaching for our 3D glasses.

The film sees Sam Worthington returning to the role of Na'vi leader Jake Sully and is rooted around the family he now has with warrior Neytiri, played by Zoe Saldana, and the battles they face to keep each other safe. Sigourney Weaver and Kate Winslet also star.

No date has been given yet, but Avatar: The Way of Water will be available to stream on Disney+ following its cinema release.

TRIANGLE OF SADNESS

A Cannes Palme d'Or-winning satire from Swedish director Ruben Ostlund, Triangle Of Sadness scored three big Oscar nominations, for best picture, best director and best original screenplay.

Targeting the filthy rich, it follows a set of luxury cruise passengers with not a redeeming feature between them. However, they soon find their status undermined by unexpected events.

You can watch Triangle Of Sadness on Amazon Prime Video and Google Play.

WOMEN TALKING

Based on the novel by Miriam Toews, Women Talking tells the story of a group of women in an isolated religious community as they grapple with reconciling their reality with their faith.

Starring Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley and Judith Ivey, with Ben Whishaw and Frances McDormand, it has a strong cast but was an outsider for the Oscars this year.

Nominated for best picture, it is the only film in the category directed by a woman, Sarah Polley - and even she didn't expect to hear its title called out, tweeting from an unusual location as she found out the good news: ""Expectations were low for today. Here I am at a routine doctor's appointment. I really didn't plan this day right.""

Women Talking is released in cinemas on 17 February, with previews from 10 February.

AFTERSUN

A coming-of-age drama, Aftersun is set in the 1990s and centres on a father-daughter duo, played by Paul Mescal and newcomer Frankie Corio, as they spend a summer holiday away at an all-inclusive resort in Turkey. Although Mescal's character Calum is seen laughing with his daughter when swimming in the sea or singing karaoke, in private moments we see his struggles with his mental health.

The film is a directorial debut from Charlotte Wells and is based on her own childhood experiences. While it isn't up for best picture, Mescal's heavily praised performance has earned him a nomination for best actor; not bad considering his Normal People breakthrough role came less than three years ago.

Following a cinema release in November, you can now watch Aftersun on the streaming service MUBI, Amazon Prime Video, and Apple TV.

THE WHALE

Enjoying a so-called ""Brenaissance"", Brendan Fraser - known for leading action films including The Mummy trilogy - is firmly back in the spotlight after a pause in his career, with his performance in The Whale earning him standing ovations at film festivals.

Fraser plays an extremely obese man trying to reconnect with his daughter and struggling with his mental health, and he is now the favourite to win best actor at the Oscars in March.

You can watch The Whale in cinemas from 3 February.

BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER

Despite missing out on joining fellow sequels Avatar and Top Gun with an Oscars nod for best film, Marvel's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever did score a nomination for Angela Bassett, who is up for best supporting actress.

The film is a moving tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, who played T'Challa, the Black Panther in the original film; a story of loss, grief and dealing with bereavement, with lots of action and some surprises along the way.

Not only does Bassett's nomination mark the cinematic universe's first acting nod, but she is also favourite to win.

You can watch Black Panther: Wakanda Forever on Disney+ from 1 February.

LIVING

Starring British veteran Bill Nighy and Sex Education star Aimee Lou Wood, Living is written by Kazuo Ishiguro and based on a remake of the 1952 Japanese film Ikiru. It tells the story of Mr Williams, an elderly bureaucrat who is diagnosed with an incurable illness, so decides he must start living his life to the fullest.

Nighy, perhaps destined to always be known for his fabulous turn as a washed-up rocker making a comeback in Love Actually, has been praised for his understated performance, which earns him his first Oscar nomination.

Living is available on Sky, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV and Google Play.

CAUSEWAY

Jennifer Lawrence stars as a soldier struggling to adjust back home in New Orleans after suffering a traumatic injury while fighting in Afghanistan. The film follows her character Lynsey as she adapts once again to civilian life, and forges an unexpected bond with local mechanic James, played by Brian Tyree Henry.

It's one that could have slipped under the radar but has been brought into the limelight thanks to a nod for Henry in the Oscars' best supporting actor category.

You can watch Causeway on Apple TV+.

BLONDE

Ana de Armas has received nominations for several prizes for her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in Blonde, including best actress at the Oscars and BAFTAs.

The film itself, however, hasn't been so well received; it leads the nominations at this year's Razzies, or Golden Raspberry Awards, which celebrate cinematic under-achievements and are billed as the ""ugly cousin"" of the Academy Awards. And despite praise for her performance, the film has polarised critics.

TO LESLIE

British actress Andrea Riseborough caused a bit of a stir with her first Academy Award nomination; she is in the running for best actress thanks to her performance in To Leslie, an independent drama inspired by true events. The film sees the Made In Dagenham actress playing a single mother who turns to alcoholism after winning the lottery, before turning her life around when a motel owner offers her a job.

In the run-up to the Oscar nominations, the film had received no nods at the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice awards or the BAFTAs - but broke through with the Academy seemingly in no small part thanks to a campaign by some of the most prominent names in Hollywood.

Indeed, fellow nominee Blanchett used the opening minute of her Critics' Choice speech to single out Riseborough, describing her performance as overlooked, while fellow Hollywood stars including (deep breath) Kate Winslet, Amy Adams, Gwyneth Paltrow, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Aniston, Zooey Deschanel and Helen Hunt have also raved about it.

To Leslie is available on Amazon Prime Video and Google Play.

EMPIRE OF LIGHT

Set around a cinema in the 1980s, Sam Mendes's Empire Of Light is a celebration of the big screen and also one of the most personal films the director has ever made. The film sees former Oscar winner Olivia Colman playing a woman struggling with mental health issues, a character based on the celebrated filmmaker's own mother.

The drama is a love letter to cinema itself, and a timely reminder of the beauty of the big screen experience following the COVID pandemic.

The film is nominated for best cinematography at the Oscars, while at the BAFTAs it is up for outstanding British film and best supporting actor for Micheal Ward, as well as cinematography.

Following its run in cinemas, Empire Of Light is expected to be available on Disney+ some time in February.

BABYLON

Oscar-winning La La Land filmmaker Damien Chazelle takes both recollection and rumour as his inspiration for Babylon, and the outrageous excess and rampant debauchery that supposedly went on behind the scenes in Hollywood in the 1920s.

The film stars Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt and newcomer Diego Calva in a three-hour story about filmmaking. It earned three Oscar nominations - for costume, original score and production design - but hopes were perhaps a bit higher given it's a lavish, big-budget affair (although it hasn't done particularly well at the box office, either).

If you want to see it on the big screen, Babylon is in cinemas now.

GLASS ONION: A KNIVES OUT MYSTERY

Such was the success of the 2019 whodunnit hit Knives Out that Netflix picked up the franchise, reportedly paying £375m for Glass Onion and one more sequel. This time round, the ensemble cast is even more starry - featuring Kate Hudson, Edward Norton and Janelle Monae joining Daniel Craig for his return as Detective Benoit Blanc.

This time, it's celebrities and influencers who are under suspicion, with the film taking a satirical look at the decadence of the very modern rich and famous.

Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery is nominated for best adapted screenplay at the Oscars, and you can watch it - and the first film - on Netflix.

THE BATMAN

Following a long wait for The Batman to launch in cinemas, its release date pushed back twice because of COVID production delays, it finally arrived in 2022; Robert Pattinson following in the footsteps of stars including Christian Bale, Ben Affleck, Michael Keaton and George Clooney to play the Caped Crusader on the big screen.

Another box office hit drawing people back to cinemas, it is now Oscar-nominated for best sound, best make-up and hairstyling, and best visual effects.

You can watch The Batman on Sky, Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video.

Not an Oscars contender but a hit with the BAFTA panel, Good Luck To You, Leo Grande is up for the awards for outstanding British film and outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer at the BAFTAs, as well as acting gongs for stars Emma Thompson and Daryl McCormack.

McCormack, who plays a male sex worker hired by Thompson's retired teacher, is also in the running for the rising star trophy.

Good Luck To You, Leo Grande is available on Sky and Amazon Prime Video in the UK.

THE WOMAN KING

Snubbed by the Oscars, The Woman King has at least been recognised at the BAFTAs, with star Viola Davis earning a best actress nomination, and Gina Prince-Bythewood in the running for best director.

The film tells the true story of a fierce group of female warriors who protected a West African Kingdom in the 1800s, with Davis starring. She has referred to The Woman King as her magnum opus, aiming to prove to the industry that films about black women can attract cinema audiences.

You can pre-order The Woman King on Sky and watch on Amazon Prime Video from 30 January.

TILL

Till is biographical film based on the true story of Mamie Till-Bradley, who pursued justice after the racist murder of her 14-year-old son Emmett Till in 1955 - for which star Danielle Deadwyler has been universally praised for her performance.

Despite this, it didn't receive any Oscar nominations, but Deadwyler is recognised in the leading actress category at the BAFTAs.

You can watch Till in cinemas now.

780;How legacy landfills around the UK coast are coming back to haunt us with the rubbish of the past;Saturday 28 January 2023 02:50, UK;[];['plastics'];['waste', 'coast', 'landfills', 'exposed', 'really', 'rubbish', 'haunt', 'legacy', 'isnt', 'things', 'sea', 'thames', 'thought', 'past', 'uk', 'coming', 'tilbury'];"Take a walk along the north side of the Thames estuary near Tilbury and all seems well - white egrets paddling beside the fields, crumbling forts and pillboxes defending us from past invaders.

But today's threat is already on the beaches. It lay beneath for years.

On closer inspection the crunch below my boots isn't pebbles but breaking glass. This isn't shingle but ground up waste - bottles, pottery, bricks and corroding metals.

It hasn't travelled far as the seashore here was once a landfill site and the stubby cliff exposed as the tide drops reveals exposed seams of waste. What we buried has emerged to haunt us.

Layers of plastic sheeting flap and flake in the breeze, while plastic bubble bath bottles, vintage crisp packets and retro fabrics rise up from the earth.

Rightly, we worry hugely about dropping litter and waste pollution yet here is a wellspring of rubbish spewing more debris into the sea with every storm.

It almost has to be seen to be believed.

On this spot near Tilbury, there are two legacy landfill sites next to each other.

Combined they stretch for hundreds of metres. Dumping began in the Victorian era - one closed in the seventies, the other not until 1991.

There are thought to be at least 1,000 dumps around our coastline and in a recent survey, 26 councils said they had old seaboard rubbish tips they could do longer defend.

'Hazardous chemicals' a hidden risk in the rubbish

It isn't just unsightly but dangerous, says AJ McConnell from the conservation group Thames 21.

""As it starts to come out, it's exposed to the elements. And it starts to break down and make its way into really, really small pieces. And then they call them microplastics.

""It's not just the plastics, it's also the hazardous chemicals. And that can be a really serious issue for wildlife.""

What is the Doomsday Clock and how does it work?

Better home insulation could mean people living longer

Understanding of these risks has emerged remarkably recently. In the not too distant past we thought it was okay to dump rubbish directly into the sea.

Most of these coastal landfills operated under much more lax environmental regulations and climate change is accelerating erosion, says William Powrie, professor of geotechnical engineering at the University of Southampton.

""We have got sea level rise and increased storminess so the waves are starting to attack things at a higher level,"" he said.

""So, you know, there's a whole complex of things going on which probably were unpredictable 20, 30 years ago.""

Now we know it's harmful but doing anything about it is tough.

The clean-up solutions are either digging the waste up and reburying it somewhere safer or building really tough sea defences.

These are both controversial and really expensive with bills possibly stretching to billions of pounds.

Neither local authorities, central government or the companies who once operated these sites are willing to foot the bill.

Which means coastal rubbish and its toxic components won't be laid to rest any time soon.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128035218/http://news.sky.com/story/how-legacy-landfills-around-the-uk-coast-are-coming-back-to-haunt-us-with-the-rubbish-of-the-past-12796798
781;Raye on the fight to release debut album My 21st Century Blues: 'It's been a real wild journey';Saturday 28 January 2023 03:07, UK;['gemma peplow', '@gemmapeplow'];['raye'];['century', 'artist', 'think', 'wild', 'real', 'industry', 'ive', 'things', 'im', 'debut', 'raye', 'album', 'fight', 'really', 'release', 'music', 'long', 'blues', 'journey'];"Raye is gaining her power back. Not just from the industry that made her feel ""mediocre"" for so many years, but over past traumas she kept bottled up for a long time.

""Some of my closest friends didn't even know some of the stuff I'm discussing on my album,"" she tells Sky News. ""It's probably the most honest I've been. It's deep and it's real.""

Raye, real name Rachel Keen, is only 25 but already a music industry veteran; a platinum-selling performer and a songwriter with credits for everyone from Charli XCX and Little Mix to John Legend and Beyonce.

She was just 15 when she released her first song and 17 when all her dreams came true, in the form of a four-album contract with record label Polydor. But after years of what seemed to be a successful career as a vocalist collaborating mainly on other artists' dance hits, in 2021 she posted a string of tweets claiming the label was holding her back from releasing her own album.

""I'm done being a polite pop star,"" she wrote, her frustration and anger palpable. The singer says after years of ""trying to make it work"", she had reached the point where she had nothing to lose. ""You get to that breaking point, really.""

Shortly after her tweets, it was announced she and Polydor were parting ways, with the label saying the decision had been ""amicable and mutual"" and wishing her ""all the very best for the future"".

Image: Raye claimed her first number one with Escapism at the beginning of 2023. Pic: Official Charts

Fast-forward 18 months or so and Raye is in a very different place; now an independent artist, earlier in January she topped the UK charts for the first time with viral hit Escapism. In February, the debut album she fought so hard to make, My 21st Century Blues, will finally be released. No longer pigeonholed or stifled, this is the real Raye, she says, and it's been a long time coming.

""The album is discussing a lot of different topics... the deepest depths of really ugly stories about assaults and body dysmorphia and environmental anxiety. I think there's no limit on what I've really spoken on in terms of my perspective on my blues as a woman in the 21st Century.""

'It's things I've been silent about for so long'

Advertisement

Always outspoken, Raye is not an artist who sticks to trotting out lines of approved PR-speak when she's being interviewed, and this candidness is evident throughout her music. ""Being real and transparent is really important to me, to skip out metaphors and similes and cut straight to the point of what I'm talking about,"" she says. ""Some of these things I haven't also entirely healed from.

""It's definitely going to be a rollercoaster for sure, but one that I'm making the decision to go on. That's kind of the artist I like to be, transparent, honest. I think that's what I'm like in real life.""

One song, Ice Cream Man, deals with sexual assault. ""It's things I've been silent about for so long and swallowed for so long and self-managed for so long in non-constructive ways,"" she says.

""I've written pretty transparently about sexual violence... multiple things that occur in a life that you just bury, bury down, hide in a box, don't tell anyone. And it just festers and manipulates itself into something quite ugly.""

As with Escapism, a dark electro banger about using alcohol, drugs and casual sex as coping mechanisms for dealing with emotional pain, the album is a contrast of often melancholy or dark lyrics, with beats that will fill a dance floor, as well as a range of genres.

""You've got songs with a contrasting sonic landscape,"" she says. ""I find it really exciting to tell a story and then the music feel the opposite so I think there's a lot of juxtaposition there.""

Irony in its 'most hilarious and ridiculous form'

Escapism's success feels ironic to Raye. ""With the previous music, not in a bad way, but it was more about the song than about the artist. The big dance songs or whatever, they don't necessarily say anything about me as a person. I never necessarily wanted to be someone who did huge, huge hits, but without depth and substance or discussing things I'm passionate about, or breaking a couple of rules.

""Escapism is such a personal story. It's kind of dark. It's extremely explicit and honest and raw... I really told myself on the beginning of this next chapter, I'm not creating music with the intent or purpose to sell loads of copies, it's about integrity and telling these uncomfortable stories that I think are really important.

""I had all the preparation in the world for building a small, steady fanbase bit by bit, and to not expect anything in terms of mainstream reflection. So this is like irony in its most hilarious and ridiculous form, that this is the biggest song of my entire career.""

'I was right to back myself': Raye rises to first number one

Raye speaks out after leaving record label

Despite it not necessarily being the plan, she admits topping the charts does feel like vindication.

""[I feel] like anything is possible and I was right to back myself,"" she says. ""Never give up on your dreams. For someone who [felt] so, like, mediocre and... such a disappointment, actually, for so long, to just receive all the affirmation in the world that I was right to back my music is just...""

She doesn't need to finish the sentence. ""For someone who puts words together for a living, I don't necessarily really have the best words to describe how crazy this is.""

'Fear is the driving factor of secrets'

Emboldened, Raye says artists need to speak out more about the inner workings of the industry. And despite moves to improve diversity and equality making headlines in recent years, she says misogyny is still rife.

""We do need to be telling these stories more,"" she says. ""I think things that happen in the darkness have so much more power than they do when they're brought out to the light, you know? Fear is the driving factor of secrets, and truths and stories being withheld. But there is still that very sad view that women need to be guided and controlled and taught and given instructions to follow and meet these requirements.""

She sighs. ""I don't know... I think it's probably the same for all artists but especially for women, especially for everything I've witnessed in 10 years in the industry. I think a lot needs to change, but I don't think anything will truly be equal and fair until we've got the same amount of female CEOs as we do male CEOs, we've got the same amount of female staff working a video shoot as male staff, the same amount of female A&Rs;, and the same amount of, you know, different ethnicities in these same roles.

""Balance overall is so important, and until we have that, there's always going to be issues and problems when you have men deciding what they think is best for women.""

Raye is looking to the future. She says she has had little communication with her former label bosses since she left, but wants to make it clear it wasn't all bad. There were ""some great people there who really believed in me... but obviously it came down to the big people making big decisions"", she says.

I ask her about the artwork for My 21st Century Blues; it features a little girl, dressed for the workplace but teetering in red stilettos hanging off her heels, standing atop a pile of instruments and recording equipment bearing the names of her songs, grabbing hands reaching out from inside. It feels poignant.

""That's actually my baby sister on top of that big structure we built,"" says Raye. ""But that little girl up there is me, you know, seven years old, wide-eyed with a dream, not realising what the next 10 or 15 years of my life would be like.

""All the different life - in the industry and out of the industry - that I've had to navigate, process, understand, learn in my transition to being a woman, to being an artist, to being an independent artist. It's been a real wild journey.""

Figures by the Resolution Foundation show more than two in five (44%) working-age households reported being either behind on or struggling with housing-related costs in November.

The figures also showed that the proportion of those who have fallen behind or are struggling has jumped from 26% during the depths of the COVID pandemic in January 2021.

The Foundation suggested that while the COVID crisis worsened housing stress, the current cost of living crisis has delivered a more extensive shock to households.

Nearly half (48%) of social renters reported being unable to afford to replace electrical goods, or switch the heating on when needed, researchers found.

Cara Pacitti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""With many renters reaching the limits of already depleted finances, this squeeze is having profound impacts on their household budgets and wellbeing.""

Nearly a fifth (19%) of social renters reported falling behind with their housing costs, as did 4% of mortgage holders. Some of those surveyed owned their home outright.

Researchers found 8% of private renters reported falling behind on housing costs in the three months leading up to November 2022.

The footage shows police beating the 29-year-old for three minutes while screaming profanities at him throughout the attack.

Police have released four separate videos cut into one hour-long clip.

Memphis police chief Cerelyn Davis told reporters it was from ""three different streams"".

She said: ""It's three different sources: body-worn camera, an actual source right there at the scene where the most physical you know abuse occurred and then two other body-worn cameras from the officers at that same scene.""

Ms Davis had earlier asked for calm before the video footage was made public.

""I expect you to feel what the Nichols family feels,"" she said. ""I expect you to feel outrage in the disregard of basic human rights.""

Five sacked officers, who are all black, have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, including assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression, over Mr Nichols' death.

In the footage of the attack, one camera shows the initial police stop at an intersection in Memphis, Tennessee.

""I'm going to baton the (expletive) out you,"" one officer can be heard saying. His body camera shows him raise his baton while at least one other officer holds Mr Nichols.

After the first officer roughly pulls Mr Nichols out of his car, the FedEx worker can be heard saying ""I didn't do anything"" as a group of officers begins to wrestle him to the ground.

""Get on the ground!,"" one officer yells, as another is heard yelling: ""Tase him! Tase him!""

After the beating, officers milled about for several minutes while Mr Nichols lay propped up against the car, then slumped onto the street.

In footage from one of the cameras Mr Nichols is heard shouting for his mother while police attack him.

Mr Nichols is then pepper-sprayed and punched in the face.

'A heinous, reckless and inhumane' attack

Ms Davis said the officers were ""already ramped up, at about a 10"" during the initial stop.

She added the officers were ""aggressive, loud, using profane language and probably scared Mr Nichols from the very beginning"".

""We know something happened prior to this officer or these officers getting out of their vehicles... just knowing the nature of officers, it takes something to get them amped up, you know, like that. We don't know what happened,"" she said.

""All we know is the amount of force that was applied in this situation was over the top.""

Ms Davis also described the officers' actions as ""heinous, reckless and inhumane,"" and said that her department has been unable to substantiate the reckless driving allegation that prompted the stop.

Demonstrator says 'they killed a man that looked like me'

Protests are taking place in at least nine cities across the US in the hours since the bodycam footage was released.

Mr Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, had earlier warned supporters of the ""horrific"" nature of the video but pleaded for peace saying ""tearing up the streets"" is ""not what my son stood for"".

Demonstrations are taking place in Sacramento in California, Washington DC, Atlanta in Georgia, Boston in Massachusetts, New York, Asheville in North Carolina, Philadelphia in Pennsylvania and Providence in Rhode Island.

A demonstration organised by Black Lives Matter is taking place in Memphis, Tennessee, where Mr Nichols was attacked.

Sky's US correspondent James Matthews, who is at the demonstration, asked one protester how she felt when she saw the video.

She replied: ""It was heartbreaking, very very difficult to watch. It was just heartbreaking that's all I can say.""

A man who was attending the protest in Memphis told Sky News: ""(The attack was) unprofessional, not police-like, I don't agree with that.

""That's why I am down here now. That was disgusting to me.""

A second man said: ""I was very sad about the situation and I'm praying for Tyre Nichols' family. I'm very upset about the video, it was disturbing, they killed a man that looked like me.

""Being a black man in this country is hard, we came here as slaves and feel like there is still slavery, feel like we will never escape it.

""Being a black man is hard, traffic stops, going to the mall, you're being watched, you're being filmed.

""Being a black man is hard.""

Meanwhile, police in New York City have made at least three arrests at a protest near Times Square.

One arrest was for damage to a police car, a second was for punching a police officer and a third was for an undisclosed reason, a police captain told NBC News.

Police are also documenting any damage to other vehicles as protesters weave through cars. They also confiscated bikes from protesters who were trying to prevent arrests from being made.

The New York Police Department has issued a statement condemning the ""disgraceful actions"" by the Memphis officers which are an ""unequivocal violation of our oath to protect those we serve, and a failure of basic human decency"".

In light of the protest action expected in the city over the coming days, the force has said there will be an ""increased police presence over the next days to ensure that people who choose are able to express themselves freely and safely"".

Given the likelihood of protests, Ms Davis had told ABC that she and other local officials decided it would be best to release the video later in the day, after schools were dismissed and people were home from work.

Biden says he is 'outraged' and 'deeply pained'

New York Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer, said he and other mayors across the country had been briefed by the White House in advance of the video's release, which he said would ""trigger pain and sadness in many of us. It will make us angry"".

FBI Director Christopher Wray said he was ""appalled"" by the video and that all FBI field officers have been alerted to work with state and local partners, including in Memphis, ""in the event of something getting out of hand"".

Tyre Nichols' final words move us to ask important questions James Matthews US correspondent @jamesmatthewsky Sometimes, there are no words. Articulating the loss of a son can stretch the vocabulary in the best of times. The family of Tyre Nichols find themselves in the absolute worst. What words can convey how it feels to have a son, your son, battered to death on camera? As hard as anyone tried at a news conference inside Mount Olive Cathedral in Memphis, maybe the job was done best by Tyre himself. At the end of the video, he is heard to call out for his mother, three times. This, a mummy’s boy who had her name tattooed on his arm. They are his final words on footage that shows him becoming limp, unconscious and clearly in distress. He was surrounded by police and other medical specialists who stood back rather than stepped in. His final words were a plea to someone he knew would help, his mum, who lived three blocks from where he was beaten. RowVaughn, Tyre's mother, wasn't aware of it until it emerged on the video. She only knows now because she's been told - she can't bring herself to watch the images. ""You have no clue how I feel,"" she told a news conference when asked about her son calling out for her. And, of course, we don't. But we are asked to consider how we would feel - by the sense of helplessness and lack of humanity aggravated by the desperate cry of a grown man to his mother. It helps an audience empathise, as well as sympathise, and that's important amidst the demands for change. The case of Tyre Nichols moves us to ask important questions around police culture in the United States.

US President Joe Biden said in a statement after the footage was released: ""Like so many, I was outraged and deeply pained to see the horrific video of the beating that resulted in Tyre Nichols' death. It is yet another painful reminder of the profound fear and trauma, the pain, and the exhaustion that black and brown Americans experience every single day.

""My heart goes out to Tyre Nichols' family and to Americans in Memphis and across the country who are grieving this tremendously painful loss.""

He added: ""Violence is never acceptable; it is illegal and destructive. I join Mr Nichols' family in calling for peaceful protest.""

Four months on, he's earned praise for balancing the books but still had a blank space to fill in when it comes to growth - a crucial plank of economic policy in danger of becoming a dirty word after Truss pursued it over a cliff edge.

The economic circumstances remain deeply challenging, with inflation running above 10%, interest rates on the rise and public sector workers demanding pay rises while business and Conservative backbenchers want tax cuts to incentivise investment.

Two months before his first budget, the chancellor was not about to blow a reputation for rectitude by announcing detailed new policy.

Instead, we got a speech that, in tone if not style, could have been delivered by Boris Johnson, recasting the economic challenge as a debate between optimists and pessimists.

Brexit, Mr Hunt said, remains the opportunity on which future prosperity will be based, despite the myriad challenges reported by businesses at the sharp end.

He had statistics to prove it. Britain has performed ""about as well"" as Germany since 2016 and better than Japan, Italy and France on one measure of GDP since 2010.

Asked by Sky News whether it would be more honest to acknowledge that Brexit had failed to live up to promises, he said no.

""It's a big change in our economic relations with our closest neighbours and of course that is going to need adaptation,"" he said.

""Of course there is some short-term disruption, but I think it's completely wrong to just focus on that without looking at the opportunities.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:15 'Brexit is an opportunity'

Anyone denying the UK was well-placed to thrive was peddling ""declinism"", a characterisation with echoes of Johnson's ""gloomsters"" that channelled the crudest divisions of the referendum debate.

Those guilty, Mr Hunt said, include newspaper columnists on the left and right, and the Labour Party.

Judging by conversations in the margins of his speech, he also blames a number of Britain's largest employers, who have called for more business-friendly government policy.

For the backbenchers who have lobbied hard for tax cuts despite the recent trauma of Truss' unfunded giveaway, there was a clear message.

""The best tax cut right now is a cut in inflation,"" he said.

That means do not expect much in March.

For the audience in the room, entrepreneurs and investors in the new technologies, life sciences and advanced manufacturing crucial to delivering growth, the message was delivered with a broad brush.

He said enterprise and education were priorities, pointing to the natural advantages of the City of London and the brains trust of the UK's world-leading universities.

New investment worth up to £100bn would be unlocked when reforms to EU-era regulation governing the reserves held by insurance companies are finally passed ""in the coming months"", he said.

The chancellor did not deny that the economy faces challenges, referring to the ""productivity puzzle"" that has seen output still not recover to pre-pandemic levels.

He said increasing employment was the key, highlighting a shortage of workers that many businesses blame on new Brexit immigration controls.

Mr Hunt preferred to focus on the growth of ""economic inactivity"" - those of working age who are not in work, by choice or through illness.

Around one-in-five 16-64 year olds currently meet that definition, 6.6 million people once students are removed from the figures.

Mr Hunt promised help to get the long-term sick back to work and then made a striking direct appeal to retirees: ""To those who retired early after the pandemic, or haven't found the right role after furlough, I say - Britain needs you.""

Persuading those who don't need to work to come back to the daily grind may be a tall order.

The 57-year-old has survived several attempts on his life after working as an enforcer for the criminal underworld.

He narrowly avoided being killed in a drive-by shooting when he felt bullets ""whizz"" past his body. ""I think that was the closest I came to be being murdered,"" Mick tells Sky News.

He also survived his own attempt to kill himself when he pointed a gun at his head, pulled the trigger but the weapon failed to fire.

""I dropped the gun and I cried,"" he says.

""It was the first time I'd cried since I was little boy.""

After years of violence and drug use, Mick says he had grown to ""despise"" himself.

He suffered two traumatic events growing up in Burnley, Lancashire, that sent his life spiralling into crime and substance abuse.

Aged 11, he says he was raped by a stranger in a park as he walked to school.

""I felt a hand over my mouth and I was dragged into this bandstand,"" Mick says.

""I was petrified. I still sometimes think about it. It hasn't gone away.""

The next day, Mick was told his 20-year-old sister Ann had suffered a heart attack and died in her father's arms.

""My dad came through the front door and shouted: 'Come down, your sister's dead',"" he says.

""It was cold and blunt… then he broke down. He was a tough guy my dad, but a nice man. I'd never seen him cry.""

Image: Mick Fleming says he began dealing drugs as a teenager

Life of crime

Mick says he went ""inward"" and started imagining carrying out crimes like pickpocketing ""to escape the real world"".

Soon after, he started stealing and dealing drugs as a teenager before working as an enforcer collecting debts for criminals.

He admits there was ""a lot of violence"" and that his family described him as ""demonic"" at that time. It was not until 2009 that his life changed.

Image: Mick says he spent years dealing with drug abuse

Armed with a gun wrapped in a plastic bag, Mick went to collect a debt from a man outside a gym. But when he walked towards his target, he realised the man was holding hands with two little girls - and there appeared to be ""light shining off their hands"".

""It was a really surreal moment,"" he says. ""I felt sick. I started to cough and splutter and I couldn't see.

""I felt this thing in the pit of my stomach. It was a horrible, dark feeling - like a sickness.

""I got back in the car and drove round the corner into this little industrial unit and pulled over. I was throwing my guts up. There was blood everywhere. I looked like I'd been stabbed.""

Image: Mick was an enforcer for the criminal underworld

It was at this point that Mick tried to shoot himself. After he failed, he was later admitted to a psychiatric unit.

""I've never had a drink or used drugs since,"" Mick says. ""I was on a road to recovery from that point on.""

Meeting his rapist - and the plan to kill him

Mick had been clean of drink and drugs for about a year when he says, by chance, he met the man who raped him.

He spotted his attacker in a McDonald's restaurant. The man was drunk and Mick bought him a cup of tea.

""I knew it was him,"" Mick says. ""He didn't know it was me.""

Mick arranged to meet the man the next day with the intention of killing him.

""I went back with a knife in my sock,"" he says.

""I was going to cut his throat. I was going to kill him. Everything was building up inside me.""

Image: Mick Fleming is known locally as Pastor Mick

As Mick walked towards the man, he says he imagined killing him, with ""clear, vivid pictures"" of the brutal act in his mind.

But instead of carrying it out, Mick says he sat down and listened to what the man had to say.

""I didn't say anything,"" Mick explains. ""In that moment I got this real understanding. I thought: 'I'm not going to live in your sin.'

""People say resentment is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. That's what I'd been doing.

""I didn't grow to love the guy but, in the end, I can honestly say I didn't hate him.""

Mick says the man died about two years later.

Becoming a priest

After leaving the psychiatric unit, Mick went on to achieve a degree in theology from the University of Manchester, overcoming difficulties he faced with dyslexia.

Now ordained as a priest and recently consecrated as a bishop, he is known locally as Pastor Mick and runs a charity called Church On The Street, helping people struggling in the cost of living crisis.

Among its services, the charity provides food, mental health support and Citizens' Advice - and has recently had to start helping families pay for funerals.

""At the moment, it's far, far worse than the pandemic,"" he says. ""It's ordinary people with children who are in dire straits.""

He is also concerned about the impact of the cost of living on mental health and suicide risk.

""I've got NHS mental health teams working with us in our building. People can't afford to have a funeral for their loved ones. It's horrendous. We pay an undertaker to do the funerals for us and then I do the services for free.""

Image: William and Kate met Pastor Mick during a visit to his charity last year

Meeting William and Kate

Mick's work was recognised by royalty when Prince William and Kate visited the charity in January last year.

William has since written the foreword to Mick's book - with a TV series about his life in the works - and he was invited to Kate's Christmas carol concert in December.

""I got to pray for them which was quite an honour,"" Mick says. ""I really felt they're going to need prayers.""

Mick believes William and Kate understand the problems people are facing with the cost of living despite their royal lifestyles.

""Obviously they haven't experienced it but you don't have to dead to be an undertaker, do you?"" he says.

""They've got the ability to open doors and ask questions that need to be asked and point fingers in right directions.""

Prince William wrote foreword to Pastor Mick's autobiograpy The Prince of Wales wrote the foreword to Pastor Mick’s autobiography entitled Blown Away: From drug-dealer to life bringer. In it, the future King said: ""It’s impossible to visit Church on the Street and not be deeply moved by the work the organisation does for those in need. ""It is an extraordinary place that has been an important refuge and place of safety for so many. ""Often, it is only by sharing our problems and being honest with ourselves that we are able to heal and overcome life’s challenges. ""And by doing so, we find just how deep the bonds we all share are.""

Mick - who was married with three children during his time as a criminal enforcer - says he has repaired relationships with his family over the years.

""I wasn't a good father,"" he says. ""I have to live with that fact.

""I'd want it to be better with my children, that's the truth. But it's all right - my family have come to accept me, and love me, and care for me. It's the best I can do.

""Some of it is my regret around my children. I wish I could turn the clock back with that but I can't so I accept it and do the best with it.""

However, the Russian foreign ministry said her arrival would not improve ties between the two countries because of what it called Washington's ongoing ""hybrid war"" against Russia.

Israel's national emergency medical and ambulance service said it was called to a ""shooting terror attack"" in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan, in east Jerusalem, on Saturday morning.

Police say they sent a ""large"" force to the scene and that a ""shooting suspect"", said to be a 13-year-old boy from east Jerusalem, was ""wounded"" and ""neutralised"".

Officers said a gun used by the boy, described by police as a ""terrorist"", was recovered at the scene.

Two men, aged 23 and 47, and believed to be a father and son, were wounded in the incident. They were both taken to hospital in a ""moderate to serious"" condition, according to medics.

It comes after a Palestinian gunman shot seven people dead near a synagogue on the outskirts of the city on Friday.

Three others were injured in that shooting, including a 15-year-old boy who was recovering from surgery, hospital officials said.

Police said the gunman arrived at about 8.15pm local time (6.15pm UK time) and described the shooting as a ""terror attack"".

They added it took place outside a synagogue in Neve Yaakov, considered by Israelis to be a neighbourhood within Jerusalem, while Palestinians and much of the international community consider it occupied land illegally annexed after the Six-Day War in 1967.

Police said the gunman fled in a car after opening fire and officers gave chase and after an exchange of fire killed him.

He was described as a 21-year-old resident of east Jerusalem who ""carried out the attack at the scene alone"".

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had held a security assessment and decided on ""immediate actions"" following Friday's shooting.

Mr Netanyahu urged people not to take the law into their own hands and said Israel would act with ""determination and composure"".

Flybe has told its passengers to ""not travel to the airport"" unless they have arranged alternative flights with another airline.

What are passengers' rights if your flight is cancelled?

Flybe going into administration is a different situation to when an airline that still operates cancels flights.

Given the company is unable to trade anymore, the cancelled flights will not be rescheduled nor can passengers be rebooked onto other airlines.

Aviation analyst Alex Macheras told Sky News: ""While the UK government has stepped in before when larger airlines or travel groups go bust, this will not be the case for Flybe 2.0.

""As Flybe mostly sell 'flight only' bookings, travel is not ATOL protected, which means refunds from the company itself will not be provided.

""Anyone with bookings will have to rely on a refund from their credit card or debit card provider, or by claiming from travel insurance.""

He added that if a passenger booked their flights with a credit card and it was more than £100, they are protected under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.

This consumer protection law stipulates the credit provider is equally liable if there is any issue with the purchase - including flights.

For flights that cost less than £100, section 75 does not apply and the card company wouldn't usually be liable.

Mr Macheras added: ""This is why it's always best to book travel with a credit card.

""If a debit card was used, passengers can try claiming from the card provider under the chargeback system, but it's often a little more difficult and not a legal right compared with the credit card.""

Some card providers will ask for a negative response letter confirming the position.

The negative response letter will be published shortly according to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

Mr Macheras said: ""There's also potentially the safety net of travel insurance, as around half of all UK travel insurance policies have scheduled airline failure cover (SAFI) as standard.""

The CAA said: ""If you did not book directly with Flybe and purchased your tickets through a third party, you should contact your booking or travel agent in the first instance.""

It said if passengers went via airline ticket agents, they are the first point of call and ""they may have provided travel insurance that includes SAFI [Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance] cover"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128110308/http://news.sky.com/story/flybe-what-are-passengers-rights-when-flights-are-cancelled-by-a-bankrupt-airline-12797215
795;Tyre Nichols death: Haunting video of arrest is sickening indictment of policing that night in Memphis;Saturday 28 January 2023 08:27, UK;['james matthews', '@jamesmatthewsky'];['tyre nichols'];['officers', '20', 'say', 'sickening', 'tyre', 'death', 'policing', 'words', 'man', 'video', 'nichols', 'wrestled', 'haunting', 'young', 'memphis', 'indictment', 'night', 'watch'];"Of all the words used prior to prepare us, nothing spoke louder than the pictures.

That the images were captured on police bodycams made it the more chilling - a murderer's eye view, as the indictment would have it.

The video footage is as shocking as it is haunting.

Having stopped Tyre Nichols in his car, Memphis police officers instantly escalate a situation to extreme violence.

Tyre is the only man featured on film seemingly trying to calm the situation.

Unfortunately, fatally, it is beyond his control.

It is difficult to watch him wrestled to the ground, calling out to his mother in the last words that he would ever speak.

Tyre receives no treatment until an ambulance arrives after more than 20 minutes.

We watch for more than 20 minutes as he is propped, handcuffed, against a vehicle, clearly in distress.

As his condition deteriorates, he slumps sideways to the ground.

He is a man dying, and yet, all those around him appear to stand by and do nothing.

The police officers who inflicted the fatal injuries share a debrief, fist bumping each other.

You can hear the adrenaline.

It is a sickening indictment of policing as it happened that night in Memphis.

Lawyers for Tyre's family say it reflects a police culture embedded in racism and the abuse of power - no matter that the officers involved are black, they say, as the problem lies in a learned expectation of immunity and impunity that pervades policing.

The same lawyers are gratified by the speed and seriousness of the charges laid against the officers involved.

They see progress, and say it should be a blueprint for similar cases in future - now, they gain sympathy and support through the violent and very public demise of a much-loved young man in Memphis.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128110308/http://news.sky.com/story/tyre-nichols-death-haunting-video-of-arrest-is-sickening-indictment-of-policing-that-night-in-memphis-12797192

Both the UK and the US have also pledged more heavy weapons, despite fears such a move might escalate the war.

Either way, Vladimir Putin is escalating. A further mass mobilisation of troops in Russia is on the way.

But many Ukrainian citizens are also mobilising, becoming increasingly focussed on volunteerism and fundraising in a bid to bolster the war effort, according to the contributors behind Sky News Ukraine War Diaries' podcast.

""Any government cannot supply 100 per cent of everything to our soldiers,” explains Ilyas Verdiev, who in this latest episode follows a national trend by using his birthday to raise money for Ukrainian military units in Bakhmut - the eastern city at the epicentre of the fighting right now.

“This is how the whole nation accumulates their possibilities in order to support our soldiers,” he continues.

This week, the fundraising of company executive turned military volunteer, Seva Koshel - who has completed more than 15 military assignments to source vehicles for the front line - helps a tank unit near Bakhmut.

“I just had a few calls with my guys who are nearby Bakhmut,” he explains. “Last week we have crowdfunded some money and we bought four tablets for [our] guys who are serving in one of the brigades.

""They’re in tank regiment and they need this tablet, as they put some special military software [on it] and their fire will be better now.”

Meanwhile, months of fighting in the east has resulted in more displaced families arriving into Kyiv.

“These are the people who moved from the east and south of Ukraine,” explains diarist, Oksana Koshel. “From the towns and villages that are now facing a threat of possible occupation or destruction.

“They now find themselves in, you know, severe need of things that we use everyday, such as like, towels or cutlery or bedding [and] blankets.”

The airline has gone into administration less than a year after returning to the skies following a previous collapse.

Sky News understands that 277 of Flybe's 321 staff have been made redundant. The remaining 44 have been retained.

Ticket-holders were advised to check the Civil Aviation Authority website for further information or if they had booked through an intermediary to contact the relevant agent.

Flybe operated scheduled services from Belfast, Birmingham and Heathrow to airports across the UK and to Amsterdam and Geneva.

In a statement posted on its Twitter account, the airline said: ""We are sad to announce that Flybe has been placed into administration.

""David Pike and Mike Pink of Interpath have been appointed administrators.

""Regretfully, Flybe has now ceased trading.

""All Flybe flights from and to the UK are cancelled and will not be rescheduled.""

Flybe planned to operate hundreds of flights a week

Flybe had previously been pushed into administration in March 2020 with the loss of 2,400 jobs as the COVID-19 pandemic battered large parts of the travel market.

Its business and assets were purchased in 2021 by Thyme Opco, which is linked to US hedge fund Cyrus Capital.

Thyme Opco was renamed Flybe Limited.

It had been based at Birmingham Airport.

On the resumption of its flying operations last April, it planned to operate up to 530 flights a week across 23 routes, serving airports such as Belfast City, Birmingham, East Midlands, Glasgow, Heathrow and Leeds Bradford.

The attack outside a synagogue in east Jerusalem, which killed seven civilians and injured many more, comes after weeks of increasing violence in the West Bank, in which 30 Palestinians have been killed.

Just hours after the synagogue shooting, Israeli authorities said two people were wounded in an attack in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan in east Jerusalem.

And we are still less than a month into 2023.

Image: Two people were wounded in an attack in Jerusalem on Saturday

Add to that, deepening fractures within Israeli society, with tens of thousands taking to the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to protest policies of the country's newly formed right-wing government, and it feels like we are at a tipping point.

The prospect of another popular uprising, a Third Intifada, has been threatened many times over many years, but it does feel like we're at an inflection point right now.

A conflagration of politics and violence has put the region on edge.

Anger and hate has been steadily simmering in the West Bank.

Palestinians complain about the expansion of Jewish settlements in the Occupied Territories, a lack of basic services like waste disposal, water provision, and the absence of hope, in particular for the younger generation.

Image: The synagogue shooting took place in Neve Yaakov

The prospect of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis has not so much faded as totally disappeared.

Thirty years after the signing of the Oslo Accords, a supposed blueprint to build a two-state solution, and the situation is arguably worse than it's ever been.

Israel has a new government, only a few weeks old, headed by the veteran Benjamin Netanyahu but with many far-right, nationalist politicians in the cabinet.

This will present a dilemma for Netanyahu, who will be under international pressure to calm the situation, whilst having to address voices in his cabinet who will want a tough response to Palestinian violence.

Image: Israel has a new government headed by Benjamin Netanyahu

Although the situation in Gaza has remained largely calm, with the exception of a brief rocket exchange earlier in the week, Hamas is encouraging Palestinian resistance in the West Bank.

These situations can dissipate as quickly as they flare up, but this time it's as tense as I've known it.

Spearritt, 41, said she had to move into a friend's office after being forced out by a landlord.

In the last six months, the singer has lived in four temporary homes with her partner, Adam Thomas, and their two children who are three and four-years-old.

Speaking to The Sun, Spearritt said they had no choice but to move after a landlord left them with two days to find a new place to stay.

""Our landlord needed the money and the property sold so fast,"" she said.

""What screwed us is we didn't have time to find another place. We had somewhere over Christmas but ran out of time before we could move in. It was just a couple of weeks.

""We were allowed to stay in our friend's office. We just used it as our living room.

""It was extra space. It was stressful but you deal with it, don't you? Especially with the kids.""

She added: ""People think we must all be millionaires but sadly it's just not true. It was what it was and we enjoyed ourselves at the time.""

She said that the band's wages weren't anything ""compared to the money being made"".

In 2018, Paul Cattermole, another member of S Club 7, sold his Brit award for £66,000 after stating he had ""bills to pay"".

According to The Sun, Spearritt earned £150,000 a year when she was performing with S Club 7.

The band achieved chart-topping success from 1998 until they split in 2003 - however, they have since reunited for tours across the UK.

Spearritt went into acting after the band split, landing a role in ITV drama Primeval in 2007, and she performed in the West End a few years later.

The singer told The Sun she has also faced health issues and that her and her partner's café business has recently stalled.

""I had an illness that took it out of me and I hardly got out of bed in three months,"" she said.

""There have been delays with the café. The reasons are very personal. It's life stuff, and hard to explain.

""But ultimately we're still here. And the café will open. We're looking forward to the future.""

Spearritt is the only original group member not to sign up for S Club 7's reunion shows, including dates at London's O2 Arena, this autumn.

She told The Sun that there was still a chance she would join her bandmates for the comeback shows but that it was dependent on her health.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128141939/http://news.sky.com/story/s-club-7-singer-hannah-spearitt-reveals-homeless-struggles-people-think-we-must-all-be-millionaires-but-sadly-its-just-not-true-12797297

The father-of-one died three days after the beating he received on 7 January and five officers have been charged with second-degree murder.

Police initially said Mr Nichols had been stopped for reckless driving and that a ""confrontation"" occurred in an effort to detain him.

However Memphis police chief Cerelyn ""CJ"" Davis said a review of the incident could not ""substantiate"" the reckless driving claim.

Here is a timeline of the crucial moments from the footage - released by police - that recorded events from 8.24pm to 9pm.

8:24pm

This is the first sight of Mr Nichols' car, already stopped at a junction where two officers order him to get out of his vehicle.

One of the officers opens the driver's door and drags the 29-year-old out.

Mr Nichols can be heard to tell them: ""Damn, I didn't do anything.""

8.25pm

As he is forced to the ground and sworn at, Mr Nicols can be heard to try and pacify the police saying: ""All right, all right.""

One of the officers tells him: ""I'm going to tase your ass.""

Mr Nichols says, ""All right, I'm on the ground... Stop, stop... You guys are really doing a lot right now. I'm just trying to go home... Stop. I'm not doing anything.""

He then breaks free and runs away in the direction of his mother's house.

An officer fires his Taser and police chase after him.

8.26pm to 8.31pm

There is no video of Mr Nichols during this time, when apparently two officers catch and detain Mr Nichols.

8:31pm

Mr Nichols is seen on the ground being subdued by two officers, less than half a mile from where the traffic stop happened.

8:33pm

A third officer arrives on the scene.

One of them says: ""Do you want to get sprayed again?""

Two officers can then be seen punching and slapping Mr Nichols as he lies on the ground trying to protect his head from the blows and screaming: ""Mom. Mom.""

The newly arrived officer tells his colleagues to ""watch out"" before spraying Mr Nichols, who again cried out: ""Mom. Mom.""

His mother's house is just a short distance away.

An officer then orders Mr Nichols to ""give me your hands.""

A fourth policeman arrives on the scene.

Mr Nichols is then sprayed again which apparently also hits another officer, who can be heard swearing.

8.34pm

One of the officers kicks Mr Nichols in the face twice.

The officer who had stepped away returns and says, ""I'm going to baton the f*** out of you"" raising his stick.

8.35pm

The officer with the baton hits Mr Nichols with it three times as other officers begin to stand him up.

One officer punches Mr Nichols at least five times in the head while two others hold him up.

He falls to the ground and officers hold him down.

8.36pm

A fifth officer arrives on scene and kicks Mr Nichols, before another officer kicks him.

A sixth and seventh officer arrive who appear to observe the scene. One of them makes a call on his radio.

8.37pm

Officers step back with Mr Nichols now in handcuffs.

8:38pm

Mr Nichols is dragged across the ground and propped sitting up against a patrol car.

8.40pm

Officers stand around discussing the incident, laughing and joking.

One complains about having hurt his leg.

8.41pm

Mr Nichols slumps to his right to the ground.

""Hey, sit up, bro,"" one officer says. Mr Nichols is grabbed by the arm and pulled back into a sitting position.

Two emergency medical staff arrive but is unclear what treatment if any is given.

8.41pm to 8.55pm

Mr Nichols remains on the ground as officers mill around.

One leads down and tells him: ""You can't go nowhere.""

8.55pm to 9pm

Emergency workers appear to begin tending to Mr Nichols again as he is propped up against the police car.

9pm

A stretcher is wheeled into the area and two minutes later an ambulance arrives.

9.18pm

Mr Nichols complains of difficulty breathing and is taken to hospital.

A post-mortem examination later reveals he ""suffered excessive bleeding caused by a severe beating"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128145054/http://news.sky.com/story/punched-kicked-and-tasered-timeline-of-violent-arrest-of-tyre-nichols-12797300

The study, from the University of Adelaide, discovered meat from four threatened species was being sold as ""flake"" in some takeaways in South Australia.

Flake, an umbrella term for shark meat fillets in Australia, is popular because of its white colour, mild flavour and soft texture, but according to the Australian Fish Names Standard, only two types of shark - gummy shark and New Zealand rig - should be sold under the term.

The study analysed the DNA of fillets from more than 100 retailers across Adelaide and regional areas of South Australia, and found nine different types of species being sold under the term.

Among them were threatened species, including the shortfin mako shark and the smooth hammerhead, while some were sharks not found in Australian waters, the study found.

""Only 27 per cent of all samples were identified as gummy shark, a species that has a sustainable population, and is one of only two species that is recommended to be labelled as flake in Australia,"" said Ashleigh Sharrad, the lead author and a researcher from the University of Adelaide's School of Biological Sciences.

""Our results highlight the need for clearer national guidelines or labelling laws for shark fillets.""

Image: Flake is a popular meat fillet because of its white colour, mild flavour and soft texture

Of all the flake samples analysed, only one in 10 retailers could correctly identify the type of fish being sold.

About a fifth of the fillets were mislabelled and the remainder had ambiguous labelling.

Professor Bronwyn Gillanders, from the University of Adelaide, said: ""Food fraud in the seafood industry is a growing concern and mislabelling may occur. It can have potential implications on human health, the economy, and species conservation.""

806;Andrew Tate: Snapshot of controversial influencer's estimated earnings revealed;Saturday 28 January 2023 03:15, UK;['sanya burgess', '@sanyaburgess'];['andrew tate', 'data and forensics'];['revealed', 'figure', 'earnings', 'andrew', 'sky', 'tate', 'sale', 'estimated', 'controversial', 'snapshot', 'tates', 'video', 'website', 'views', 'influencers', 'rumble', 'social'];"Influencer Andrew Tate gained many of his millions of followers by telling them he's rich - and he'll make them rich too.

The self-proclaimed misogynist has gone from posing on yachts and filming himself jetting off to Dubai, to being arrested in December over allegations of being part of an organised crime group, human trafficking and rape.

Symbols of Tate's apparent wealth, including luxury cars and properties, have been seized by the Romanian police who are investigating Tate, 36, and his brother and business partner, Tristan, 34.

Image: Luxury cars were seized in a case against Andrew Tate

So, with Tate's assets under the microscope, what is known about how much money his business actually makes?

Speculation about his wealth varies wildly and many of the claims Tate makes about his earnings are unverified, including six-figure sums connected to his ""camgirl"" business.

It is not known whether this business is connected to the charges facing the brothers and two Romanian women, all of whom deny the claims made against them.

Using publicly available information, Sky News has looked at how much his company might be making through video streaming, as well as selling subscriptions and merchandise.

Video streaming

Banned from Twitter in 2017 (but since reinstated in November 2022), Tate was also removed from YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok in August 2022 for breaching their terms and conditions. But he had already built up millions of followers on each platform.

His army of fans followed him to anti-""cancel culture"" streaming platform Rumble, where Tate's associates continue to post clips while he is in prison. Rumble's emphasis on ""free speech"" has made it popular among right-wing commenters.

Tate claims he signed a $9m (£7.3m) deal with Rumble in 2022, according to CNN. Rumble did not reply to Sky News' request for comment, but issued a statement to CNN calling for the charges against Tate to be ""investigated promptly and thoroughly"".

Sky News has collated Tate's video streams from his two Rumble channels, TateSpeech and TateConfidential. The former saw higher video views more consistently after he was blocked by other social media sites.

Although TateConfidential is less successful, the two channels collectively mean Tate has amassed huge viewing figures.

Rumble advertises itself as offering some of the most generous amounts paid out per video view, saying that ""1,000 views on Rumble.com may earn you as much as 10,000 views on YouTube"".

Sara McCorquodale, chief executive and founder of influencer intelligence CORQ, explains that how much social platforms usually pay out tends to be ""a bit of a grey area"".

""[On Rumble] it could be anything from $0.30 to $20 or $50 per 1,000 views,"" she said.

""Andrew Tate could be making anything from $600 (£490) to $20,000 (£16,250) for his most prolific videos.""

By this estimate, Tate's most popular video ""EMERGENCY MEETING 1 - THE MATRIX ATTACKS"", which was broadcast five months ago in the days after he was banned from other social platforms could have earned him up to $133,500 (£108,400) after hitting 2.67m views.

As well as earning money through adverts, Rumble gives creators a bonus if their video is hosted on the site's front page.

Mrs McCorquodale explained that Tate's potential earnings on Rumble show just how large his following is, despite the influencer not having access to most mainstream social media sites.

She said: ""It shows the numbers of views we are seeing on Andrew's channels are all coming from his audience.

""This is quite worrying because it shows the scale at which he has attracted people to his narrative.

""Andrew Tate is very much aiming his content at young men... He tries to be aspirational, but then he also tries to connect with young men by seemingly understanding the challenges they face in society today.""

Manosphere merchandise

With Tate banned from most social media, his fans flock to his website - including to buy merchandise to support him.

Activity on his merchandise page has been saved by the Internet Archive project, a digital library of websites. Its records can not be edited or altered.

Using it, we can see how many items were advertised as for sale, at what price and on what date they were listed as having sold out by.

A screenshot of Tate's online merchandise store on 22 October shows that a T-shirt named ""Resist the Slave Mind"" was on sale.

It shows Andrew Tate dressed like a character from the 1999 film The Matrix while holding a red pill. The red pill, a motif from the movie, is popular symbol in what is known as the ""manosphere"", a loosely connected groups of online misogynists.

The now sold-out shirts were on sale for $100 (£81) each with 1,000 in stock.

This means the T-shirts would have brought in $100,000 (£81,000) of revenue. This is the overall figure earned and would not include any outgoings or division of profit.

These calculations are being made based on figures provided by Tate's website.

These figures may be unreliable, with Sky News discovering that at least one claim on the site is wrong.

Tate's website claims the Resist the Slave Mind T-shirt sold out in the specific timeframe of 25hrs 19m and 43 seconds.

However, archived pages show the T-shirt on sale on 22 October, was still on sale on 5 November and was listed as sold out by 7pm the following day.

This means the T-shirt was on sale for more than two weeks, rather than just over a day.

Other sales on his site recorded by the archive include another T-shirt named ""Vision"". It was put on sale for $100 (£81) per shirt with 651 listed as available, earning a potential $65,100 (£52,700).

A hoodie, ""Cobra"", was on sale for $150 (£120) but the internet archive did not record how many units were available.

A pair of mugs were on sale for $139 (£113) with 888 on offer, potentially generating $123,400 (£100,000).

This means, since the end of October, $265,100 (£215,000) may have been generated through merchandise alone - not including the $150 hoodies, of which we don't have a verifiable stock figure for.

Tate also sells supplements on his website, priced at $54.99 (£44.50).

We don't have stock figures to access through the archive, but data provided to Sky News from website analytics company SimilarWeb can give us an insight.

They estimate that the number of hits on the checkout page for supplements in November was around 6,500 and in December around 3,100. While a person visiting the checkout page does not guarantee a sale is made, it does give a sense of how many users are getting to that stage of the purchasing process.

Money-making memberships

Tate sells access to schemes that are advertised as teaching people how to make money online through sessions on skills such as copywriting and crypto-trading.

This is ""a classic influencer strategy"" that Andrew Tate has put his own spin on, says Mrs McCorquodale.

""The clever thing Andrew Tate has done is recognise that he is a divisive character. Many people may not want to be seen as a fan of him publicly but are buying his subscriptions and engaging privately.

""His subscriptions allow people to engage without risk of judgement. This is crucial.""

There are two levels of access. The first is ""The Real World"", a new incarnation of the Hustler's University, which was shut down last year.

Subscribers pay $49.99 (£40) a month for access to group chat rooms, tutorials and ""millionaire mentors"". For those signing up early, an entry fee of $27 (£22) was payable, which later increased to $147 (£120).

The website claims over 200,000 people have transferred over from Hustler's University or joined the scheme when it launched in November. This would bring in at least $9,998,000 (£8,089,140) a month in subscriptions if that figure is accurate.

However, Sky News has seen a Telegram group for The Real World where members of Hustler's University were automatically added. It only has 126,255 subscribers.

The number of views each announcement in the group gets has dropped from around 230,000 at the start to around 45,000 in January.

Web traffic to the log in page for The Real World is also much lower than the membership figure would suggest.

Less than 100,000 hits were registered by VStat, another web traffic monitor, in January. The service is unable to give a more precise audience figure when views are this low.

Tate's other subscription service is The War Room, where membership is significantly more expensive, at $5,454 (£4,400), which must be paid via cryptocurrency.

It is not possible to find a reliable independent figure which could indicate how many people are subscribed to The War Room.

Sky News contacted Tate's lawyer for comment regarding the figures set out in this article but did not receive a response.

What can we learn from this snapshot of Tate's earnings?

For Mrs McCorquodale, Sky News' findings goes some of the way towards answering if these earnings tally with Tate's displays of wealth.

""What's clear is he has multiple revenue streams which all link back to him monetising his digital audience and mean he is less reliant on mainstream social media platforms,"" she said.

""These let him continually push a message and amass more new customers but ultimately he is trying to get them off those platforms and onto his own [such as] his War Room subscription.""

The future of Tate's earnings may well be hit by the police investigation, with Mrs McCorquodale highlighting the falling viewing figures on Rumble after his arrest.

She said: ""Many people may like what he's saying and think the controversy around him is overblown. But the minute there is a chance he might actually be a criminal, they're out.

""Perhaps this has made consumers review more carefully who he is and his real impact beyond making people annoyed on Twitter.""

807;Fresh trans prisoner row as girl's stalker approved for move to women's jail;Saturday 28 January 2023 15:11, UK;[];['scotland'];['prisoner', 'trans', 'scottish', 'row', 'risk', 'girls', 'women', 'vulnerable', 'womens', 'prison', 'violent', 'fresh', 'scott', 'jail', 'individual', 'safety', 'stalker', 'approved'];"Another trans prisoner has been given the green light to transfer to a women's jail in Scotland, Sky News understands.

The latest controversy follows double rapist Isla Bryson being removed from an all-female prison near Stirling this week after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was forced to intervene in the row.

Bryson, a serial sex offender who attacked vulnerable women when she was known as Adam Graham, decided to transition while awaiting trial, which provoked outrage among campaigners.

It is now understood prison chiefs have in recent weeks approved the move of Tiffany Scott, who stalked a 13-year-old girl while known as Andrew Burns.

It is believed Scott will switch from a male wing to an all-female unit.

It is unclear where this location will be.

Cornton Vale is Scotland's only all-women site, but female prisoners are also detained at other jails.

The Scottish Conservatives have told Sky News they want Ms Sturgeon to again block the move.

The party's equalities spokesperson, Rachael Hamilton MSP, said: ""The fact that such a violent and dangerous criminal is set to be transferred to a women's prison is absolutely appalling.

""It is clear that Tiffany Scott continues to present a grave risk to the safety of any women that come in contact with them - even trained prison staff.

""The idea that this violent individual may soon have access to scores of vulnerable women within our prison estate is truly repellent.

""Women's safety must not take a backseat to the wishes of violent criminals.

""Nicola Sturgeon has already U-turned under public pressure to belatedly remove double rapist Isla Bryson from a women's jail, she must now intervene to block the transfer of this violent individual before it takes place, or knowingly risk the safety of some of Scotland's most vulnerable women.""

The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) said it does not comment on individual cases, but confirmed it was drawing up fresh proposals on dealing with trans prisoners.

An SPS spokesman said: ""We do not comment on individuals.

""Decisions by the SPS as to the most appropriate location to accommodate transgender people are made on an individualised basis, informed by a multi-disciplinary assessment of both risk and need.

""Such decisions seek to protect both the wellbeing and rights of the individual as well as the welfare and rights of others around them, including staff, in order to achieve an outcome that balances risks and promotes the safety of all.

""Where there are any concerns about any risks posed by an individual, either to themselves or others, we retain the ability to keep them separate from the mainstream population until an agreed management plan is in place.""

A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The placement of prisoners is an operational matter for the Scottish Prison Service who use comprehensive individualised risk assessments to inform decisions, such as the appropriate location of transgender people in custody.

""SPS is reviewing their policy on managing transgender prisoners in partnership with the Scottish government and that process is nearing completion.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128154730/http://news.sky.com/story/fresh-trans-prisoner-row-as-girls-stalker-approved-for-move-to-womens-jail-12797405
808;Hundreds come forward to claim a role in King Charles's coronation;Saturday 28 January 2023 15:42, UK;['rhiannon mills', '@skyrhiannon'];"[""king's coronation"", 'royal family']";['king', 'service', 'coronation', 'queens', 'claim', 'charless', 'role', 'think', 'queen', 'things', 'royal', 'right', 'forward', 'hundreds', 'come', 'monarchy'];"Sky News has learned that hundreds of people are coming forward to claim a role in the coronation of King Charles after a Coronation Claims committee, set up by the government, opened applications up to those who believe they have a hereditary or historic right to carry out ceremonial roles during the event in May.

Ahead of the closing date for applications on 3 February, the cabinet office has told Sky News they've had a very good response with hundreds filling in forms to perform historic roles.

Based on examples from past coronation claims, that could include the right to give the King a glove or a towel during the service.

It throws into the spotlight the complex and potentially risky balancing act that the King, the palace and the government face when it comes to making this coronation feel reflective of Britain's history, while still being relatable, inclusive and acceptable to a less deferential audience today.

Some, of course, love the ritual and pageantry that will unfold inside Westminster Abbey, as was proven by the audiences for the Queen's funeral and Platinum Jubilee.

However, Catherine Pepinster, author of Defenders of the Faith: The British Monarchy, Religion and the Next Coronation, believes they've already missed a trick when it comes to shaking things up.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:45 Buckingham Palace has released more details of what we can expect from the King's coronation weekend in May

""They perhaps could have had a ballot and people could have applied and said 'I would like to carry the royal standard and hand over the King's glove for his moment when he wears that for holding the sceptre'. Another way they could have chosen people that have done great things for the country.

""Instead they're emphasising heredity and obviously the monarchy is about heredity ... I can't see why they didn't grab the opportunity to use those sorts of small ceremonial moments to be more modern because of the people involved.""

She added: ""The thing people have to remember is the coronation is not actually set in stone. There's lots of traditions surrounding it but there have been changes over the years, different orders of service, different crowns.

""There are things that are musts. It always involves the taking of oaths, the anointing of the monarch and also the crowning but other things can be moved around.""



Documents at the National Archives in Kew, London, give an idea of the challenge organisers face, with the most recent blueprint for a service such as this dating back 70 years, when Queen Elizabeth II was crowned in 1953.

Image: Queen Elizabeth's coronation in 1953 was watched by 27 million people

Applications were made to the Court of Claims in 1953 to carry a towel for the Queen, give her a glove and hold her arm.

There was also a request for the right to hold a canopy over King George VI at his coronation in 1937.

Very little detail has been released so far about what elements will be included in the King's service, except that both the King and Queen Consort will be crowned, with the monarch also anointed, blessed and consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

The service will also be shorter than the Queen's coronation, which was about three hours long - her procession through London was also two hours, and it's unlikely we'll see that again.

The King has made it clear that while the weekend will be rooted in tradition, he wants it to be reflective of the future and what Britain represents today.

Since becoming King, there has been a clear push to get Charles out meeting as many diverse communities as possible.

In the week after the Queen died, he stressed that he viewed respecting and celebrating diversity as a key part of his role.

Last summer, before he became King, he guest edited The Voice Newspaper - its editor Lester Holloway said the edition received a mixed response from their readers and he expects the coronation will too.

Image: The King and Queen Consort attend the Christmas day service in Sandringham

""The Prince Charles that we saw through him guest editing showed that he does care passionately about some issues about climate change, about the environment, I would actually add race equality as part of those"", he said.

Mr Holloway added: ""I think there are moves that he can make even before the coronation so, for example, apologising for slavery and colonialism, I think that will be a major step, but more than the ceremony itself it's really the conversations that are taking place.

""So rather than just having reverence I think that we have got to embrace some hard truths and it's through that process of dialogue that ultimately the future of the royal family and the monarchy will be decided.""

While the social and political context of this coronation is different, other monarchs have also used their coronations to bring people together.

Image: Queen Elizabeth at her coronation in 1953

Katie Fox, a records specialist at the National Archives, said: ""There were street parties for the Queen's coronation and I think you can also see within our collection here at the national archive is that people, going back to the medieval period, did celebrate coronations just albeit in a different way.

""For the Queen's coronation, 27 million people watched at home which was not possible before that point.""

The family soap opera around Prince Harry and Prince Andrew provide added distractions this time around, along with questions about the amount of money needed to stage the event during the cost of living crisis.

This time, it's social media that the palace is particularly mindful of.

This will be the first digital coronation the United Kingdom has ever experienced - in the days after the Queen died, the social media channels of the royal family received 1.5 billion engagements.

It means an ever greater worldwide audience, far larger than the Queen's coronation, raising the stakes even higher for getting the right tone for what will be a global showcase for Britain and a modern monarchy.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128154730/http://news.sky.com/story/hundreds-come-forward-to-claim-a-role-in-king-charless-coronation-12797478

""On the occasions, I met Clare it was obvious how strong the bond between her and Mark was, and I can only imagine the depth of grief he is feeling.""

""On the occasions I met Clare, she was always a lovely lady and was very warm and kind. I'm shocked and deeply saddened to hear of her passing.""

Downing Street said that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had passed on his deepest condolences to Mr Drakeford privately.

Mr Drakeford and his wife married in 1977 and have three children together.

The family have lived in the Pontcanna area of Cardiff for 30 years.

The couple lived apart during much of the COVID pandemic, with Mr Drakeford staying in a building at the end of the couple's garden to allow him to carry on work while his wife remained at the house with his elderly mother-in-law, who was shielding.

He later described their reunion as ""a bit emotional"".

Speaking to the ITV Wales podcast in August 2021, he said: ""I've been married for a very long time and not to be in the house and to be at a physical distance, even though we saw each other every day and talked every day, it was a puzzling experience in that sort of way and for that to be over it is a bit emotional for everybody.""

In the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, Sir Keir promised to maintain Labour's ""radical values"" and committed to many Corbyn-era policies.

Fast forward three years, and in tone and content, the offer is markedly different.

Take this from Sir Keir in his London speech on Saturday: ""Our message at the next election must be we are different to the party Britain rejected in 2019.""

It's probably worth remembering that in 2019 Sir Keir Starmer wasn't some lowly backbencher agitating against Jeremy Corbyn's agenda, he was sat around his shadow cabinet table as Brexit secretary.

Nevertheless, Labour officials are equally punchy, saying the speech represents a ""clear repudiation of the previous leadership and everything that came with that"".

I'm also told, in this context, Jeremy Corbyn is unlikely to be readmitted to Labour ahead of the next election.

All this enrages those on the left of the party who claim Sir Keir won the leadership on false pretences by promising a Corbyn-lite agenda to the more radical membership, before junking that and morphing into something closer to Tony Blair in a bid to woo more moderate voters.

And you know what, they may just have a point.

Image: The Labour leader speaking at the party's London conference

In the leadership race, he made a series of pledges including scrapping Universal Credit, abolishing tuition fees and nationalising key industries.

All of those now look to be either ditched completely or severely watered down.

But does it matter?

The calculation in the leader's office will be that annoying Corbyn loyalists is a price worth paying for winning more widespread support in the swing constituencies that need to be taken to form a government.

Ruthless and hungry

When getting into power becomes a primary purpose, lots of other things can be dismissed more easily as talking shops.

In fact, you sense that Sir Keir and those around him are relishing picking this fight as it gives them a chance to define him against his predecessor.

This also suggests a ruthless streak and hunger for power (essential qualities for a prime minister) that are underappreciated in the Labour leader.

The risk is that voters may look back to what Sir Keir was saying in 2020 and what he's saying now and wonder if his promises for government are equally changeable.

And this speaks to another hole Labour still hasn't quite plugged: finding a stirring an exciting answer to the question of who Sir Keir Starmer is and what drives him forward.

It's an issue not lost on some in the party, who worry that answering it could be proving difficult because the core political ideology that shapes a leader's thoughts and guides their actions is not as potent in Sir Keir as it was in some of his predecessors.

This needn't be an issue if Labour can start to tell a more convincing story in either personal or policy terms about what their leader is all about, beyond being a good and competent man.

Speaking at a rally in Harlem, New York, Reverend Sharpton also rejected the idea that there was no race element to the fatal beating of Mr Nichols by the officers just because they themselves are black.

It comes after Memphis Police released bodycam footage showing police beating the 29-year-old for three minutes while screaming profanities at him throughout the attack.

Five officers have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, including assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression, over Mr Nichols' death.

Following an internal investigation in which they were found they used excessive force or failed to intervene, the officers were also dismissed by Memphis Police Department's Chief of Police, Cerelyn Davis.

Ms Davis, who became the force's first black female boss in 2021, previously called for ""sweeping changes and police reform"" in the aftermath of the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Reverend Sharpton, making a speech at a weekly National Action Network rally, said: ""So there's a new precedent set now 'cos this black women police chief messed you up now - 'cos she said I'm not waiting on nothing - arrest them, fire them.

""You now got a new clock on police accountability. We don't want to hear no year investigation.""

Meanwhile, at a press conference of city leaders held on Saturday, state representative Joe Towns Jr, echoed the comments of Reverend Sharpton on the force's prompt investigation.

The comments came as a memorial fund set up in the aftermath of Mr Nichols topped $535,000 (£433,000).

The GoFundMe page, set up by Mr Nichols's mother, is aimed at helping to pay for a memorial skate park in his honour, as well as to allow his family time off from their jobs to grieve and seek justice.

On Saturday, police released four separate videos cut into one hour-long clip, including police bodycam footage and footage from a CCTV camera of the attack on Mr Nichols.

In the footage, Mr Nichols can be heard screaming ""mom, mom"" several times as the beating unfolds. He was 80 yards (73 metres) from his family home, according to his mother.

Police chief Davis asked for calm before the video footage was made public.

""I expect you to feel what the Nichols family feels,"" she said. ""I expect you to feel outrage in the disregard of basic human rights.""

Protests are taking place in at least nine cities across the US - including Memphis - after the bodycam footage was released.

Mr Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, had earlier warned supporters of the ""horrific"" nature of the video but pleaded for peace saying ""tearing up the streets"" is ""not what my son stood for"".

Attention turned to the Memphis Police Department to tackle the murder rate, which led to the creation of the Scorpion Unit in October 2021.

""MPD's New SCORPION UNIT Launched!"" read a post on the department's Facebook page, along with a video clip showing a group of officers in tactical vests at a roll call.

The name stands for the Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace In Our Neighborhoods - yet officers from that same unit were responsible for the brutal assault of Tyre Nichols this month during a traffic stop for alleged reckless driving.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:33 Memphis authorities have released video footage of Tyre Nichols being held down by officers and struck repeatedly as he screamed for his mother.

""The Scorpion unit was involved,"" Steve Mulroy, the District Attorney for Shelby County, Tennessee, confirmed on Thursday when he announced the murder charges against five officers.

Police Chief Cerelyn Davis, who has called the attack ""heinous, reckless and inhumane"", has announced a review of all of the police department's specialised units, including Scorpion, in response to Mr Nichols' death.

A unit designed for 'crime suppression'

The Scorpion unit was created in October 2021 under the police department's Organised Crime Unit after a record 346 homicides were reported in 2021 - up from 332 the previous year.

Made up of 40 officers divided into four 10-member teams, the unit was tasked with addressing violent crime and investigating car thefts and gangs.

In January last year, Mayor Jim Strickland promoted the unit as part of the solution to the high homicide rate, stating that in its first three months, it had made hundreds of arrests and seized hundreds of cars and weapons.

Its operations were flaunted on the police department's Facebook page: arrests that began with traffic stops, escalated into more serious confrontations and ended with arrests of people for drugs and guns.

'Police do what they can to arrest people'

Mark LeSure, a former Memphis police sergeant who retired in 2021, said he had begun to see a large number of relatively inexperienced officers being put on specialised units as other members of the force quit.

Mr LeSure added that the units did not have enough senior staff members training the new officers.

""Rookies were getting put on specialised units where they had no business being,"" he said.

Two of the five officers involved in the assault on Mr Nicols, who are aged between 24 and 32-years-old, had been on the job for a couple of years, and the others no more than six years.

Mr LeSure said some of his former colleagues who are still at the department have told him that the Scorpion unit, which launched after he retired, is known for having a ""zero tolerance"" policy on crime - which he said meant the officers ""do what they can to arrest people"".

Police initially said Mr Nichols had been stopped for reckless driving on 7 January and that a ""confrontation"" occurred in an effort to detain him.

However, Ms Davis said a review of the incident could not ""substantiate"" the reckless driving claim.

He died three days after the assault.

'Unit is an excuse to harass everyday residents'

E. Winslow Chapman, the director of the police department from 1976 to 1983, said that when he was leading the force officers were not considered for specialised units without at least seven years on the job.

Mr Chapman said: ""You're using officers to send a message that we're here and we're not going to tolerate criminal activity anymore ... and it can very easily go overboard, which it obviously did in this case.""

Chelsea Glass, a community organiser in Memphis who is an advocate for criminal justice reform, called Scorpion a street crime-fighting team relying on traffic stops as excuses to find violent criminals and weapons.

""They harass everyday residents, and they're calling this high-level policing,"" he said.

""But it's really just stop-and-frisk on wheels. It doesn't matter what name you slap on it.""

The five officers have been charged with second-degree murder, official misconduct, aggravated kidnapping, official oppression and aggravated assault.

818;FlyBe collapse asks questions about the resilience of UK's transport infrastructure;Saturday 28 January 2023 18:53, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];[];['infrastructure', 'resilience', 'questions', 'trying', 'flights', 'collapse', 'question', 'willing', 'asks', 'second', 'regional', 'uks', 'flybe', 'transport', 'airline'];"FlyBe is a smaller, less significant business than when it collapsed for the first time in March 2020, but a second failure in three years raises questions not just for prospective owners, but the connectivity of the UK.

Three years ago the failure of what was then Europe's largest regional airline was blamed on the advancing pandemic, but in truth the company had been in trouble for years.

A government-brokered deal two months earlier with shareholders, including Virgin and the US hedge fund Cyrus Capital, kept planes in the air, but ultimately they couldn't defy economic gravity.

Flybe collapses and cancels all flights, with hundreds of jobs lost

What are passengers' rights when flights are cancelled by a bankrupt airline?

Cyrus Capital bought the brand out of administration and, in April last year, resumed operations trying to do what FlyBe 1.0 had failed to do; turn a profit from an airline dedicated to serving the UK's nations and regions.

Its strategy was to use the regional services as a bridgehead into international travel, filling spaces on flights to and from Belfast, Birmingham and London not filled by domestic travellers with passengers bound for the US and Europe.

A route to Amsterdam and slots at Heathrow were central to the plan, offering access to major hub airports from which FlyBe hoped alliances with larger airlines would follow.

With the airline industry still recovering from COVID and stiff competition from more established low-cost operators, that plan has not paid off.

FlyBe had been due to take delivery of 17 new aircraft this year, but delays to the new fleet limited the potential for partnership despite Cyrus putting in an estimated £50m to keep the enterprise airborne.

That cash has now run out, leaving administrators seeking a buyer willing to give the brand a third chance, and the UK facing a recurring question about the resilience of its transport infrastructure.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:29 The airline has gone into administration less than a year after returning to the skies following a previous collapse

It is a question of particular salience in Northern Ireland, where FlyBe was a major operator out of Belfast City airport.

In 2020 FlyBe's future was a political issue, with ministers willing to discuss cutting passenger duty in order to make good on Boris Johnson's election promise to level up the UK's regions.

Three years on the political imperative, along with Mr Johnson, has largely moved on, but the economic imperatives remain. Transport infrastructure is a prerequisite of growth, particularly if you are trying to share it around, and the cutting of regional ties comes at a cost.

With the rail industry in turmoil and the train network a national embarrassment you might think there has never been a better time to offer an alternative.

FlyBe's second grounding suggests otherwise.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128191701/http://news.sky.com/story/flybe-collapse-asks-questions-about-the-resilience-of-uks-transport-infrastructure-12797845

821;Black people in UK 'living in fear' over racism, say UN experts;Saturday 28 January 2023 18:47, UK;['shamaan freeman-powell', '@shamaan_skynews'];['united nations'];['say', 'living', 'descent', 'working', 'black', 'african', 'day', 'fear', 'racism', 'experts', 'findings', 'uk', 'transport', 'group'];"Black people in the UK are ""living in fear"" due to structural, institutional and systemic racism, according to a United Nations working group.

The experts, who spent 10 days travelling across the UK, warned that people of African descent continue to encounter racial discrimination and erosion of their fundamental rights.

It also highlighted ""trauma"" felt by people who are suffering racial discrimination, particularly in the criminal justice system.

Dominique Day, a human rights expert for the group, said: ""What we found overwhelmingly was a culture of fear, a culture of denial, where the conversation about racism usually involves gaslighting and the delegitimisation of very credible claims.""

The group found the fear in black communities was ""pervasive"" and widespread across multiple sectors, including - but not limited to - asylum seekers, the Windrush generation, people in social housing and parents experiencing social care scrutiny.

""It was widespread, it was across sectors, across generations, across income levels, but it was a real feature of everyday life for a lot of black people here,"" said Ms Day.

Olamide said he was 17 when he was arrested by British Transport Police in a case of mistaken identity.

He said he was ""manhandled"" by two police officers, had his face pushed against the pavement and handcuffs were placed so tightly they drew blood.

""I've seen this in the movies, I've seen this happen to other people, and I never thought it would actually happen to me,"" he said.

""I have never committed a crime. I haven't done anything illegal, but I still had to experience something that shouldn't have happened to me. It's upsetting.""

In response to the complaint, British Transport Police said: ""The result of the complaint has since been finalised. No misconduct was identified - however the service was found to not be acceptable.

""This has been explained in a letter to the complainant, acknowledging that our communication with him during the incident could have been better and could have helped de-escalate the situation.

""British Transport Police has offered an apology to the boy and his family and the officers involved have been provided with points of learning.""

Image: Olamide said he's in constant fear of being stopped by police

'Playing the race card'

Olamide said the incident not only left him with physical scars, but mental ones too.

""Every time I can hear a siren I still feel startled, even though I haven't done anything wrong; but they can just randomly pull up and arrest me the same way they did before.

""So I'm just living in constant fear of not knowing if I'm gonna get arrested, or if a police officer is going to stop me. Or if anything bad's gonna happen to me,"" he said.

When asked if he agreed with the working group's findings that racism is often dismissed, he swiftly nodded his head.

""Yes"", he said, explaining that when he told officers he believed he was treated unjustly due to the colour of his skin, he was told he was ""playing the race card"".

""There's been so many instances where I've had people say, 'here we go, the race card', like we use it as a defence mechanism.

""We use it because we know when something's wrong.""

The UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent also met representatives from UK central government and local government, including the department responsible for equality.

It did find some positives, highlighting that the country is a ""leader"" in the collection of data and good data practice.

But the group found holes in the government's plan to tackle discrimination by ""focusing on equality of opportunity and not equality of outcomes"".

Experts say this is a failure to acknowledge or confront how opportunities for people of African descent have been eroded through all aspects of society.

'Trying to justify inaction'

Ms Day described the government approach as being like ""twisting into a pretzel"" and that it was ""very apparent at the higher levels of government"".

This isn't the first time the working group has travelled to the UK. They were invited in 2012, but they said many of the conditions for people of African descent seem to have worsened.

Instead of addressing the human rights of people of African descent, the working group said ""we saw really complex narratives trying to justify inaction"".

The experts have encouraged all stakeholders, including the government, to do more to ensure the rehabilitation, restoration and reconciliation of the state with its people.

They will present a report with their findings and recommendations to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2023.

But Ms Day added: ""There's enough reports, there's enough recommendations, there's enough data, and we say that in the findings as well.

A government spokesperson said it ""strongly"" rejects most of the findings, claiming the report ""wrongly views people of African descent as a single homogenous group of people"".

It said the findings present a ""superficial analysis"" of complex issues that fail to look at all possible causes of disparities, not just race.

""We are proud that the UK is an open, tolerant and welcoming country but this hard-earned global reputation is not properly reflected in this report,"" the spokesperson said.

""We are not complacent and recognise some people experience racism in Britain, but we are very clear this has no place in our society and must be rooted out.""

They said the government had made ""great strides in addressing racial and ethnic disparities, most recently with our ground-breaking Inclusive Britain strategy"".

""Instead of sowing division, we must celebrate the fact that this country strives to give everybody, from every community, in every corner of the UK, the opportunity to thrive and succeed,"" the spokesperson added.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230128191701/http://news.sky.com/story/black-people-in-uk-living-in-fear-over-racism-say-un-experts-12797572

Speaking at a rally in Harlem, New York, Reverend Sharpton also rejected the idea that there was no race element to the fatal beating of Mr Nichols by the officers just because they themselves are black.

It comes after Memphis Police released bodycam footage showing police beating the 29-year-old for three minutes while screaming profanities at him throughout the attack.

Five officers have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, including assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression, over Mr Nichols' death.

Following an internal investigation in which they were found they used excessive force or failed to intervene, the officers were also dismissed by Memphis Police Department's Chief of Police, Cerelyn Davis.

Ms Davis, who became the force's first black female boss in 2021, previously called for ""sweeping changes and police reform"" in the aftermath of the 2020 murder of George Flloyd in Minneapolis.

Reverend Sharpton, making a speech at a weekly National Action Network rally, said: ""So there's a new precedent set now 'cos this black women police chief messed you up now - 'cos she said I'm not waiting on nothing - arrest them, fire them.

""You now got a new clock on police accountability. We don't want to hear no year investigation.""

827;Radioactive capsule missing in Australia after falling off mining truck;Saturday 28 January 2023 22:06, UK;[];['australia'];['capsule', 'depot', 'unit', 'western', 'using', 'missing', 'australia', 'tinto', 'rio', 'gauge', 'falling', 'truck', 'radioactive', 'radiation', 'mining'];"Australian emergency services are in a race against time to find a tiny but potentially deadly radioactive capsule that has gone missing while being transported 870 miles (1,400km) from a mine to a depot in the city of Perth.

The 8mm by 6mm unit, smaller than a penny, is believed to have fallen off the back of a truck on a 22-mile (35km) stretch of road in Western Australia as it was being transported from the Rio Tinto mine in Newman to the Perth suburb of Malaga.

The unit was lost after a screw became loose inside a large lead-lined gauge and it fell through a hole. The small silver cylinder contains caesium-137, a highly radioactive isotope which experts say cannot be weaponised.

The unit emits the equivalent of 10 X-rays in an hour and members of the public should stay at least 16ft away from it, state authorities said. Contact could result in skin damage, burns and radiation sickness, including effects on the immune system. Long-term exposure could also cause cancer.

The Department of Fire and Emergency Services has deployed teams with handheld radiation detection devices and metal detectors to try to find it, but state authorities have been hampered by a lack of equipment and have called for external assistance.

Search teams are concentrating their efforts on populated areas north of Perth and sites along the Great Northern Highway.

Superintendent Darryl Ray said: ""What we're not doing is trying to find a tiny little device by eyesight.

""We're using the radiation detectors to locate the gamma rays,"" he said.

Image: An investigation will look at the handling of the gauge and capsule at the mine site

Authorities are using the truck's GPS data to determine the exact route the driver took and where it stopped during its journey. They are concerned the capsule could have lodged in another vehicle's tyre and could be hundreds of miles away from the search area.

Rio Tinto had contracted an expert radioactive materials handler to package the capsule and transport it ""safely"" to the depot, and was not told it was missing until 25 January.

The Western Australia government waited two days to inform the public on Friday. Its chief health officer Andrew Robertson defended the delay, saying the mine and depot had to be searched and excluded, and the route confirmed.

""We believe the vibration of the truck may have impacted the integrity of the gauge, that it fell apart and the source actually came out of it,"" he said. ""It is unusual for a gauge to come apart like this one has.""

""Our concern is someone will pick it up, not knowing what it is, think this is something interesting (and) keep it.""

Attention turned to the Memphis Police Department to tackle the murder rate, which led to the creation of the Scorpion Unit in October 2021.

""MPD's New SCORPION UNIT Launched!"" read a post on the department's Facebook page, along with a video clip showing a group of officers in tactical vests at a roll call.

The name stands for the Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace In Our Neighborhoods - yet officers from that same unit were responsible for the brutal assault of Tyre Nichols this month during a traffic stop for alleged reckless driving.

Warning: This article contains violent images

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:33 Memphis authorities have released video footage of Tyre Nichols being held down by officers and struck repeatedly as he screamed for his mother.

""The Scorpion unit was involved,"" Steve Mulroy, the District Attorney for Shelby County, Tennessee, confirmed on Thursday when he announced the murder charges against five officers.

Police Chief Cerelyn Davis, who has called the attack ""heinous, reckless and inhumane"", announced on Saturday that after ""[listening] intently"" to Nichols' relatives, community leaders and uninvolved officers, she felt ""it is in the best interest of all to permanently deactivate the Scorpion unit.""

A unit designed for 'crime suppression'

The Scorpion unit was created in October 2021 under the police department's Organised Crime Unit after a record 346 homicides were reported in 2021 - up from 332 the previous year.

Made up of 40 officers divided into four 10-member teams, the unit was tasked with addressing violent crime and investigating car thefts and gangs.

In January last year, Mayor Jim Strickland promoted the unit as part of the solution to the high homicide rate, stating that in its first three months, it had made hundreds of arrests and seized hundreds of cars and weapons.

Its operations were flaunted on the police department's Facebook page: arrests that began with traffic stops, escalated into more serious confrontations and ended with arrests of people for drugs and guns.

'Police do what they can to arrest people'

Mark LeSure, a former Memphis police sergeant who retired in 2021, said he had begun to see a large number of relatively inexperienced officers being put on specialised units as other members of the force quit.

Mr LeSure added that the units did not have enough senior staff members training the new officers.

""Rookies were getting put on specialised units where they had no business being,"" he said.

Two of the five officers involved in the assault on Mr Nicols, who are aged between 24 and 32-years-old, had been on the job for a couple of years, and the others no more than six years.

Mr LeSure said some of his former colleagues who are still at the department have told him that the Scorpion unit, which launched after he retired, is known for having a ""zero tolerance"" policy on crime - which he said meant the officers ""do what they can to arrest people"".

Police initially said Mr Nichols had been stopped for reckless driving on 7 January and that a ""confrontation"" occurred in an effort to detain him.

However, Ms Davis said a review of the incident could not ""substantiate"" the reckless driving claim.

He died three days after the assault.

'Unit is an excuse to harass everyday residents'

E. Winslow Chapman, the director of the police department from 1976 to 1983, said that when he was leading the force officers were not considered for specialised units without at least seven years on the job.

Mr Chapman said: ""You're using officers to send a message that we're here and we're not going to tolerate criminal activity anymore ... and it can very easily go overboard, which it obviously did in this case.""

Chelsea Glass, a community organiser in Memphis who is an advocate for criminal justice reform, called Scorpion a street crime-fighting team relying on traffic stops as excuses to find violent criminals and weapons.

""They harass everyday residents, and they're calling this high-level policing,"" he said.

""But it's really just stop-and-frisk on wheels. It doesn't matter what name you slap on it.""

What do we know about the officers?

The five officers have been charged with second-degree murder, official misconduct, aggravated kidnapping, official oppression and aggravated assault.

Here is what is known about each one.

The move comes after Memphis Police released bodycam footage showing Mr Nichols screaming for his mother while being beaten by officers.

The footage shows police attacked the 29-year-old for three minutes while shouting profanities at him.

Mr Nichols was 80 yards (73 metres) from his family home, according to his mother.

Police have released four separate videos cut into one hour-long clip, including police bodycam footage and footage from a CCTV camera.

Five officers have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, including assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression over Mr Nichols' death.

In the footage of the attack, one camera shows the initial police stop at an intersection in Memphis, Tennessee.

""I'm going to baton the f*** out of you,"" one officer can be heard saying. His body camera shows him raise his baton while at least one other officer holds Mr Nichols.

After the first officer roughly pulls Mr Nichols out of his car just after 8:20pm on 7 January this year, the FedEx worker can be heard saying ""I didn't do anything"" as a group of officers begins to wrestle him to the ground.

""Get on the ground!,"" one officer yells, as another is heard shouting: ""Tase him! Tase him!""

The father-of-one calmly replied soon after being wrestled to the pavement: ""OK, I'm on the ground.""

The camera is briefly obscured and then Mr Nichols can be seen running as an officer fires a Taser at him. The officers then start chasing Mr Nichols.

He is then punched, kicked and hit with a baton. After the beating, officers mill about for several minutes while Mr Nichols lies propped up against the car, then slumps onto the street.

Emergency workers with what looks like medical equipment attend, but do not immediately intervene.

He died on 10 January, three days after the violent arrest.

The officers involved have been dismissed by Memphis Police Department's Chief of Police, Cerelyn Davis.

Ms Davis, who became the force's first black female boss in 2021, previously called for ""sweeping changes and police reform"" in the aftermath of the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Meanwhile, influential civil rights campaigner Al Sharpton said the US has a ""new clock"" on police accountability following the quick arrest and firing of five officers charged over the death of Mr Nichols.

Speaking at a rally in Harlem, New York, Reverend Sharpton also rejected the idea that there was no race element to the fatal beating of Mr Nichols by the officers just because they themselves are black.

Image: Tyre Nichols called out for his mother three times as he was being beaten

Making a speech at a weekly National Action Network rally, he said: ""So there's a new precedent set now 'cos this black women police chief messed you up now - 'cos she said I'm not waiting on nothing - arrest them, fire them.

""You now got a new clock on police accountability. We don't want to hear no year investigation.""

Addressing the involvement of race, he said: ""One person said to me well at least it ain't about race.

""I said the race part of it is those black guys thought they could get away with doing it to a black guy.

""You know you couldn't get away with doing that in Tennessee to a white guy - and you won't get away with doing it to a black guy either.""

Meanwhile, at a news conference of city leaders held on Saturday, state representative Joe Towns Jr, echoed the comments of Reverend Sharpton on the force's prompt investigation.

He also said police chief Ms Davis had his full support, praising her for taking ""swift action"".

The comments came as a memorial fund set up in the aftermath of Mr Nichols topped $535,000 (£433,000).

The GoFundMe page, set up by Mr Nichols' mother, is aimed at helping to pay for a memorial skate park in his honour, as well as to allow his family time off from their jobs to grieve and seek justice.

Protests are taking place in at least nine cities across the US - including Memphis - after the bodycam footage was released.

Mr Nichols' mother had earlier warned supporters of the ""horrific"" nature of the video but pleaded for peace saying ""tearing up the streets"" is ""not what my son stood for"".

US President Joe Biden said he was ""outraged and deeply pained to see the horrific video of the beating that resulted in Tyre Nichols' death"".

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said more ""urgent community response teams"" will be created to provide patients with at-home support ""within two hours"".

The changes are being made in ""recognition of the pressures facing A&E;"".

""Up to 20% of emergency hospital admissions (are) avoidable with the right care in place,"" the DHSC said.

It is hoped that ambulance response times will improve as the plan is rolled out.

The DHSC said there is ""growing evidence"" that virtual wards are a ""safe and efficient alternative to hospital care, particularly for frail patients"".

Those looked after in this way include frail elderly patients or those with acute respiratory infections and cardiac conditions.

Clinical teams may visit them at home or use video to ""monitor and check how they are recovering"".

Falls and frailty teams - which consist mainly of nurses - will also be scaled up.

832;'Google it' no more? How AI could change the way we search the web;Sunday 29 January 2023 00:00, UK;[];['artificial intelligence', 'chatgpt', 'google', 'microsoft'];['engine', 'aipowered', 'search', 'google', 'chatgpt', 'internet', 'change', 'model', 'web', 'way', 'engines', 'ai'];"It's hard to imagine the internet without Google.

The tech giant has become so synonymous with searching the web that it has become a verb - we don't look it up, we ""Google it"".

Google ended 2022 as it ends every year, as the most visited website in the world. Its estimated share of the search engine market stands at 92% (Microsoft's Bing is its closest rival, on 3%).

On the surface, it might not like a landscape that's ripe for change but don't be so sure.

The launch of ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, last year threatened to upend how people prepare for job interviews, journalists write stories, and children do homework.

Trained on a huge amount of text from across the internet, with the ability to provide human-like responses to almost any prompt, it sparked speculation it could pose a threat to Google.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:16 Will this chatbot replace humans?

Search engines ready to bet big on AI

The New York Times reports Google founders, Larry Page and Sergei Brin, have been brought back to help add ChatGPT-like features to the search engine they launched more than 25 years ago.

Google boss Sundar Pichai reportedly wants to speed up the firm's plans for conversational AI in its products and services, which go far beyond a chatbot that pretends to be a tennis ball (seriously, we tried it and it was really odd).

Advertisement

It comes as Microsoft makes a multibillion dollar investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, raising the possibility that it could find its way into products like Office (welcome back, Clippy and friends?) and - yes - Bing.

The potential AI arms race is one predicted by former Google advertising tsar Sridhar Ramaswamy, who wants to use what he learned during 15 years at the company, to get ahead of this potentially game-changing trend.

""We are at an interesting juncture,"" he tells Sky News from his home in California, from where he co-founded startup search engine Neeva.

""Where large language models and AI offer unprecedented ability to peer into information, to sift through things and deliver answers in a way that simply was not possible before. This is a really exciting time for search - and I think it's going to be disrupted in multiple ways by multiple companies.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 15:37 Can machines have feelings?

How AI could change how you search the web

Among those would-be disruptors are the likes of You.com, a search engine launched out of California (where else) back in 2021, which added a bot called YouChat in December; and Neeva's own new AI.

Neeva, which launched in the UK in October, aims to provide informative and reliable search results without being driven by user data and advertising.

Its AI functionality is being added for UK users in February. The AI trawls the web for information, produces a single, written answer to the query, and - like YouChat - cites each of its sources for users to find out more.

And it works in real time, meaning it stays up to date with current affairs and provides references accordingly for its admittedly small pool of one million monthly users.

""It gives search the power to be a lot more fluid to what it's been so far,"" says Ramaswarmy, who believes the advertising model he led at Google - which accounts for the majority of its revenue - needs to be challenged.

""The entire search experience becomes focused on just getting you to click on an ad,"" he says.

""But there is a bigger reason - the obsession with ads on the internet has also steered the Google algorithm in a way that focuses on engagement, so more and more you see 'made for Google' sites that game how to get on top.""

'I fell in love with my AI girlfriend - and it saved my marriage'

Image: YouChat launched in December 2022, as an addition to search engine You

But is it all upside?

Neeva's commitment to being ad-free comes at a premium - £5.49 a month, or £44.99 a year.

The majority of its 600,000 users are on its free tier, which limits them to 50 searches per month.

Allowing limitless searches via powerful AI isn't a particularly cost-effective business model, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitting the computing costs to run ChatGPT are ""eye-watering"".

Dr Andrew Rogoyski, from the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, says the infrastructure required to run such a service at the scale of a Google would be enormous.

""There is some way to go in streamlining conversational AI in a way that we can afford,"" he tells Sky News.

""AI is getting bigger and consuming more energy, and that's the wrong direction - it's pushing it into the hands of big organisations.""

But there are more fundamental challenges that any search engine seeking to leverage AI will need to consider.

'Incorrect or nonsensical'

Like ChatGPT, NeevaAI is a large language model, meaning it is trained on huge amounts of information.

But OpenAI acknowledges its answers can be ""overly verbose"" and ""incorrect or nonsensical"".

""It doesn't know right from wrong, it doesn't know authoritative from gossip,"" says Ramaswarmy.

Of course, it's one thing for a nascent ChatGPT to make mistakes, another entirely if a firm like Google rolls out a commercial product with similar failings. As Microsoft found out after its 2016 chatbot was taught to say offensive things.

""Conversational AI is very believable, certainly in short bursts, and that will improve over time, but because it's so believable and plausible, people will not necessarily challenge it,"" Rogoyski says.

TOP RISKS IN USING AI FOR SEARCH ENGINES (ACCORDING TO CHATGPT) Bias: AI-powered search engines can perpetuate and even amplify existing biases, particularly if the data used to train the model is biased

Privacy: AI-powered search engines can collect and store large amounts of personal data, which can be used for targeted advertising or other purposes

Censorship: AI-powered search engines may be used to censor or suppress certain types of information

Misinformation: AI-powered search engines may return misinformation or fake news, particularly if the AI model is trained on unreliable sources

Job loss: AI-powered search engines may lead to job loss for certain types of jobs, such as librarians or research assistants

Security: AI-powered search engines may be vulnerable to hacking or other types of cyber attacks, which could compromise user data or disrupt search results

Dependence: People may become too dependent on AI-powered search engines, which could lead to a lack of critical thinking and research skills

Monopoly: AI-powered search engines may lead to the creation of powerful monopolies, which could lead to a lack of competition and innovation

Are we really ready for change?

Seeing the potential for a shake-up on the internet is one thing, but seeing it through is another entirely.

Elon Musk's tumultuous takeover of Twitter hasn't upended people's habits to the extent experts predicted, with the rapid rise in users at would-be rival Mastodon having stalled.

Ramaswarmy admits causing an internet ""mass movement"" is difficult, but views ChatGPT's breakthrough as evidence that ""a platform shift"" is on the cards.

""Think of how we saw Microsoft, Nokia and Blackberry disappear from the mobile world and let Google and Apple become the dominant players,"" he says.

""It feels like this is one of these face-off moments.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129002427/https://news.sky.com/story/google-it-no-more-how-ai-could-change-the-way-we-search-the-web-12794175

The duchess writes: ""As a society, we currently spend much more of our time and energy on later life. I am absolutely determined that this long-term campaign is going to change that.""

The initiative will be supported by celebrities and academics with backgrounds in early childhood and will be launched by The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood.

The Princess of Wales says: ""We all need to know the critical importance of our early childhood. They really are years like no other in our lives.

""Our brains develop at an amazing rate - faster than any other time of our lives.

""I urge everyone reading this to take the opportunity to learn more about this incredible time of life, to think back to your own childhood and how it shaped you, and, most importantly, to ask yourselves what you can do to make the world a more supportive and loving place for our children.

""Because healthy, happy children shape a healthy, happy future.""

Two photos have been released to accompany the letter, showing the princess meeting young children at St John's Church of England School, a primary school in east London.

834;Iran protests: Bereaved families prevented from mourning their loved ones move their memorials online;Sunday 29 January 2023 00:29, UK;['victoria elms', '@victoriaelms'];['data and forensics'];['state', 'mohammad', 'memorials', 'bereaved', 'hassans', 'sky', 'protests', 'loved', 'prevented', 'families', 'hassan', 'brother', 'social', 'iran', 'online', 'ones', 'mourning', 'media', 'told', 'going'];"When protests broke out across Iran in September, 26-year-old Mohammed Hassan Torkaman's message was one of defiance.

""Personally, if I see even one symbolic protest in Babol, I will support it,"" he wrote on Twitter.

The nature-loving student was shot dead by security forces during a demonstration just two days later - protests had broken out over the death of a young woman in police custody who was arrested for wearing her hijab ""incorrectly"".

Months on, his family say they are still being harassed by the authorities in an attempt to silence them about what happened. It is an experience that human rights experts say is common for those whose loved ones died as a result of state violence in Iran.

For some families like Mohammad Hassan's, however, remaining silent is not an option. And social media is providing them with a way to memorialise and seek justice for the dead.

Mohammad Hassan Torkaman's story

Mohammad Hassan was a typical 26-year-old. He loved the outdoors, and could often be found exploring the forest with his friends. He was fascinated by space too, covering his home with posters of stars and far-flung galaxies.

His fluffy white Persian cat, Pashmak, was his pride and joy.

His brother says he was a calm, kind person who had great ambitions.

""He had big ideas and wanted to make an impact in the future,"" his brother said.

Mohammed Hassan had moved to Babol five years ago to study at university. So on 21 September, his family in Shahin Shahr, Isfahan, didn't know he had gone out to protest.

It was only when they received a worried phone call from one of his friends that they realised something awful had happened.

""I was in a terrible state of shock, so I remember everything like a nightmare,"" his brother said.

The friend told them that he had been calling Mohammad Hassan after he failed to turn up to his house as expected. An unknown voice eventually picked up and said that Mohammad Hassan had been shot.

His father, a veteran and former prisoner of war during the conflict between Iran and Iraq, was so shocked by the news that he suffered a stroke and was taken into intensive care.

His brother says that when he went to see Mohammad Hassan's body in the morgue, he saw a bullet wound in his head.

For three days, the authorities refused to release the body and only did so on the condition that the family would remain quiet about where he had been shot and held the funeral under strict security.

But even then, their ordeal was far from over.

""The events for the third and the seventh days were held under watchful eyes of the agents,"" his brother said.

At the 40th day ceremony, the situation escalated.

""They were attacked by the security forces, plain clothes militia using stun grenades, tear gas, rubber bullets, paintballs and batons. Many were arrested and wounded,"" his brother said.

It's now been months since Mohammad Hassan's death and the memorial gatherings that followed. But relatives say the authorities are still harassing them.

""We are more or less threatened, we are monitored and controlled, some days they follow us, some nights they are stationed near our home,"" his brother said.

Digital memorialisation

Azadeh Pourzand, a human rights researcher at SOAS University of London, explains that Iranian authorities have a history of treating families of those killed by the state in this way as they fear the impact the killing could have.

""It's ironic that the regime is so strong with its state violence as a repressive regime but is scared of the dead bodies it creates,"" she told Sky News.

""It's not new to see the burial ceremonies for victims of state violence being disrupted in this way. It's used as a tool to further harass and silence families,"" she said.

Azadeh says that for many years, this meant that the only cases that would garner attention were those in which the victim was already publicly known or of a certain societal status. It was therefore largely left to human rights organisations like the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center to document the stories of all of the others who died at the hands of the state.

Since 2002, the centre has run the Omid Memorial project which is a digital archive of all of those who have been killed by the state and acts as an online memorial.

""The project's mission is to ensure that all victims of the state's violation of the right to life are memorialised, that society acknowledges the harm done to them and their loved ones, to help start their healing process in the absence of justice,"" said Roya Boroumand, who runs the centre.

The advent of social media, however, has meant that individuals are now empowered to do this themselves in ways that they were previously unable to. It means that social media pages dedicated to the memory of those who have been killed in Iran are increasingly common online.

Many of these accounts are run by bereaved family members. Three months after Mohammad Hassan's death, two of his relatives set up Twitter pages that post on a daily basis, almost exclusively about Mohammad Hassan. They now have a combined following of over 27,000.

Image: This digital image of Mohammed Hassan has been shared on pages dedicated to his memory and across social media

Among the posts are pictures of Mohammad Hassan as a child, as well as his gravestone and memorial shrine. Many include anecdotes about Mohammad Hassan and calls for justice.

The hashtag of Mohammad Hassan's full name in Farsi, which features in each of the posts, has been tweeted over 143,000 times according to data collected by social listening platform TalkWalker.

""It is my duty and my family's duty to be the voice of my brother's unjustly shed blood. My father was the one who stood in front of Iraqi soldiers and defended his country. We learned our courage from him,"" Mohammad Hassan's brother said.

Other accounts dedicated to memorialising all of those who have died have also sprung up.

One page was initially created to pay tribute to the 1,500 protesters killed in 2019. The account now creates and shares memorials for those who have died during the recent protests and for those who have been executed. It has 27,000 followers on Instagram and a further 7,000 on Twitter.

""The government of Iran wants these things not to be mentioned at all, not to be heard at all. The government media denies this at all,"" the page's operator told Sky News.

""I am the voice of their grieving families,"" they said.

""What we are seeing here is grassroots archiving and memorialising,"" said Azadeh Pourzand.

She explains that these memorials are also about achieving justice for those who have died.

""The ultimate goal is: we are not going to forget and we are not going to forgive. We're not going to let our loved one's blood go to waste. We are going to keep it alive, we are going to remember and we are going to seek justice,"" she told Sky News.

835;Getting a manicure? Wear gloves or sunscreen, GP warns, after study reveals UV lamp risks;Sunday 29 January 2023 00:00, UK;[];['cancer'];['reveals', 'cells', 'sunscreen', 'skin', 'wear', 'uv', 'risk', 'used', 'cause', 'nail', 'exposure', 'warns', 'risks', 'manicure', 'mutations', 'gp', 'study', 'lamp'];"If your idea of pampering involves a trip to the nail salon, a doctor has a warning for you - protect your hands or risk damaging your skin cells permanently.

Dr Najia Shaikh - a GP, skin doctor and the founder of One Skin Clinic - told Sky News ""it's better to be safe than sorry"" when getting a manicure.

Her warning comes after a study found the UV nail polish dryers used in salons can damage DNA and lead to cancer-causing mutations in human cells.

The study looked at cells from humans and mice, and found cells died when exposed to levels of UV radiation commonly found in nail salon dryers.

'It's better to protect your hands'

Dr Shaikh said there's still very little evidence about the exact harm caused by nail lamps.

But she added ""any kind of UV radiation can actually affect the cells, mutate the cells, change the DNA"".

""It's better to protect your hands,"" she said.

She advised people to wear gloves with the fingertips cut off, or to apply a broad-spectrum cream with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 50 that protects against both UVA and UVB rays, if they do choose to expose their hands to the lamps.

These precautions are particularly important for people who get manicures regularly as the effect of UV is cumulative, getting worse with each exposure, she said.

The study doesn't mean everyone should immediately cancel their nail appointments, though, according to Dr Shaikh.

She likened the risk level to the dangers of a sunny day.

""We can't stop people from going out in the sun just because sun radiation is going to cause damage,"" she said.

What is important is being aware of the potential risks and guarding against them, she added.

UV lamps cause cells to die

Scientists have long sounded alarm bells over the cancer risk related to salon sunbeds used for tanning but new research indicates the devices used to dry gel manicures could also be harmful.

Tanning beds use a spectrum of UV light that studies have conclusively proven to cause cancer - but the spectrum used in the nail dryers has not been well-studied.

Researchers at the University of California San Diego have now found the nail dryers cause cells to die and cause mutations that could lead to cancer.

The researchers noted that a long-term epidemiological study would need to be done before ""stating conclusively"" that using the machines leads to an increased risk of skin cancers.

But Ludmil Alexandrov, one of the authors of the study published in Nature Communications and a professor at UC San Diego, said the devices were currently being ""marketed as safe"", even though little research has been done into the dryers.

What the researchers found

Use of the UV dryers for one 20-minute session resulted in 20-30% cell death, researchers found, while three consecutive 20-minute exposures caused 65-70% of the exposed cells to die.

The study looked at cells from both humans and mice. The cells were exposed to two different conditions: acute exposure, classed as two 20-minute sessions an hour apart, and chronic exposure, 20-minute sessions on three consecutive days.

Mr Alexandrov said they saw that DNA gets damaged and that some damage does not get repaired over time. This DNA damage leads to mutations after every exposure with a UV nail polish dryer.

Exposure may also cause ""mitochondrial dysfunction"" which could result in additional mutations, he said.

""We looked at patients with skin cancers, and we see the exact same patterns of mutations in these patients that were seen in the irradiated cells.""

The idea for the study came from an article Mr Alexandrov read about a young beauty pageant contestant who was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer on her finger.

""I thought that was odd, so we began looking into it, and noticed a number of reports in medical journals saying that people who get gel manicures very frequently - like pageant contestants and aestheticians - are reporting cases of very rare cancers in the fingers, suggesting that this may be something that causes this type of cancer,"" he said.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129011706/http://news.sky.com/story/getting-a-manicure-wear-gloves-or-sunscreen-gp-warns-after-study-reveals-uv-lamp-risks-12795899
836;Tyre Nichols' mother says she's 'not going to stop' until those responsible for son's death face justice;Sunday 29 January 2023 00:46, UK;[];['tennessee', 'tyre nichols'];['officers', 'mr', 'tyre', 'sons', 'shes', 'son', 'face', 'black', 'person', 'nichols', 'justice', 'responsible', 'stop', 'memphis', 'officer', 'mother', 'going'];"The mother of Tyre Nichols has said she is ""not going to stop"" until every person responsible for her son's death ""is prosecuted to the fullest of law"".

RowVaughn Wells was speaking to US news network MSNBC a day after Memphis Police released bodycam footage showing her son screaming ""mom, mom"" several times as he was attacked by officers.

Ms Wells said: ""I believe in my heart that my son was on assignment from God. He finished his assignment and God took him back home.

""Even though this tragedy happened to my son, I truly believe that there is going to be a greater good that comes out of this.

""And that is what keeps me going to get this justice for my son, because I'm not going to stop until every person that had anything to do with my son's death is prosecuted to the fullest of the law.""

Warning: This article contains violent images

Ms Wells went on to say that the officers she believes killed her son had ""shamed their own families"" and continued: ""You shamed your communities. You just brought a bad taste to everybody's mouth.

""I hate the fact that it was five black men that actually did this to another black man. My son probably was their age.

""They just brought disgrace to themselves. I'm not an evil person, my son is not an evil person.... I pray for (the officers') families, because their families didn't deserve any of this either.""

Ms Wells and Mr Nichols' stepfather also repeated their call for people to protest in a non-violent way.

Mr Nichol's mother earlier said in the same interview: ""Tyre was a beautiful person, he was full of life, as you can see he loved to skateboard, he loved to watch the sunsets. He was a great dad.

""He was just a good person. There's no perfect person in this world, but he was close to it.""

Ms Wells has spoken after Memphis Police announced the SCORPION (Street Crimes Operations to Restore Peace in Our Neighbourhoods) unit, that the five officers charged with murder over the father-of-one's death were members of, has been ""permanently deactivated"".

Memphis Police said in a statement: ""In the process of listening intently to the family of Tyre Nichols, community leaders, and the uninvolved officers who have done quality work in their assignments, it is in the best interest of all to permanently deactivate the SCORPION unit.

""The officers currently assigned to the unit agree unreservedly with this next step.

""While the heinous actions of a few casts a cloud of dishonour on the title SCORPION, it is imperative that we, the Memphis Police Department take proactive steps in the healing process for all impacted.""

The move comes after Memphis Police released bodycam footage showing Mr Nichols screaming for his mother while being beaten by officers.

The footage shows police attacked the 29-year-old for three minutes while shouting profanities at him.

Mr Nichols was 80 yards (73 metres) from his family home, according to his mother.

Police have released four separate videos cut into one hour-long clip, including police bodycam footage and footage from a CCTV camera.

Five officers have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, including assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression over Mr Nichols' death.

In the footage of the attack, one camera shows the initial police stop at an intersection in Memphis, Tennessee.

""I'm going to baton the f*** out of you,"" one officer can be heard saying. His body camera shows him raise his baton while at least one other officer holds Mr Nichols.

After the first officer roughly pulls Mr Nichols out of his car just after 8:20pm on 7 January this year, the FedEx worker can be heard saying ""I didn't do anything"" as a group of officers begins to wrestle him to the ground.

""Get on the ground!,"" one officer yells, as another is heard shouting: ""Tase him! Tase him!""

The father-of-one calmly replied soon after being wrestled to the pavement: ""OK, I'm on the ground.""

Moments later, as the officers continue to shout, Mr Nichols says: ""Man, I am on the ground.""

An officer yells: ""Put your hands behind your back before I break your (expletive).""

Moments later an officer shouts: ""Put your hands behind your back before I break them.""

""You guys are really doing a lot right now,"" Mr Nichols says loudly to the officers. ""I'm just trying to go home.""

""Stop, I'm not doing anything,"" he yells moments later.

The camera is briefly obscured and then Mr Nichols can be seen running as an officer fires a Taser at him. The officers then start chasing Mr Nichols.

He is then punched, kicked and hit with a baton. After the beating, officers mill about for several minutes while Mr Nichols lies propped up against the car, then slumps onto the street.

Emergency workers with what looks like medical equipment attend, but do not immediately intervene.

He died on 10 January, three days after the violent arrest.

The officers involved have been dismissed by Memphis Police Department's Chief of Police, Cerelyn Davis.

Ms Davis, who became the force's first black female boss in 2021, previously called for ""sweeping changes and police reform"" in the aftermath of the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Meanwhile, influential civil rights campaigner Al Sharpton said the US has a ""new clock"" on police accountability following the quick arrest and firing of five officers charged over the death of Mr Nichols.

Speaking at a rally in Harlem, New York, Reverend Sharpton also rejected the idea that there was no race element to the fatal beating of Mr Nichols by the officers just because they themselves are black.

Making a speech at a weekly National Action Network rally, he said: ""So there's a new precedent set now 'cos this black women police chief messed you up now - 'cos she said I'm not waiting on nothing - arrest them, fire them.

""You now got a new clock on police accountability. We don't want to hear no year investigation.""

Addressing the involvement of race, he said: ""One person said to me well at least it ain't about race.

""I said the race part of it is those black guys thought they could get away with doing it to a black guy.

""You know you couldn't get away with doing that in Tennessee to a white guy - and you won't get away with doing it to a black guy either.""

Meanwhile, at a news conference of city leaders held on Saturday, state representative Joe Towns Jr, echoed the comments of Reverend Sharpton on the force's prompt investigation.

He also said police chief Davis had his full support, praising her for taking ""swift action"".

The comments came as a memorial fund set up in the aftermath of Mr Nichols topped $535,000 (£433,000).

The GoFundMe page, set up by Mr Nichols' mother, is aimed at helping to pay for a memorial skate park in his honour, as well as to allow his family time off from their jobs to grieve and seek justice.

Protests are taking place in at least nine cities across the US - including Memphis - after the bodycam footage was released.

Mr Nichols' mother had earlier warned supporters of the ""horrific"" nature of the video but pleaded for peace saying ""tearing up the streets"" is ""not what my son stood for"".

US President Joe Biden said he was ""outraged and deeply pained to see the horrific video of the beating that resulted in Tyre Nichols' death"".

837;Lockwood & Co: Joe Cornish on his first TV project since The Adam And Joe Show;Sunday 29 January 2023 01:37, UK;['claire gregory', '@claireskynews'];[];['set', 'cornish', 'young', 'project', 'love', 'really', 'tv', 'lockwood', 'adam', 'supernatural', 'film', 'ghosts', 'series', 'joe'];"Many will remember Joe Cornish as one of the hosts of cult TV series The Adam And Joe Show - which saw the two friends recreating films out of toys, performing pranks, and getting Adam's dad to review music videos.

But it's now more than two decades since the programme ended and Cornish has since established himself as a writer and director, working on Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin, Marvel's Antman and his own directorial feature debut Attack The Block - which starred John Boyega in his breakout role - and more recently The Kid Who Would Be King.

Now, he's returned to TV with an adaptation of the young adult supernatural book series Lockwood & Co, for Netflix. And while it might feel to some as if Cornish takes his time between projects, he insists he's not slacking.

""This is me in rapid-fire mode,"" he laughs, pointing out to Sky News' Backstage podcast that the gap between Attack The Block (2011) and The Kid Who Would Be King (2019) is far greater than the three years between the latter and his current show.

""It takes a while to make these things - to get the money to write them, to film them, to post-produce them, so give me a break,"" he jokes. ""I'm going as fast as I can!""

Lockwood & Co is about three young paranormal investigators, set in a version of London where an invasion of ghosts is causing misery to many, and children are used to fight against them.

It's certainly not the first time Cornish has worked with a younger cast.

""I love it, I love the energy that younger actors bring,"" he says. ""I love the excitement of coming to work every day - this part of the process is incredible, the process of the cast and crew screening, the premieres, it's so exciting and it brings this really youthful energy to everything, I guess.

""And I'm less scared of directing them than I am of very experienced actors because remember: actors make three films a year, directors only make a film every three years if they're lucky, so it makes me feel like the wise old man, which I kind of am I suppose - old, maybe not so wise.""

Lockwood & Co is something Cornish has been interested in for a while; he read the first of Jonathan Stroud's books a decade ago, describing it as ""really brilliant and unique in these core ideas it has"", but after a bidding war another studio bought the rights and his career took him elsewhere.

Some 10 years later, the rights became available again - and now with several more books in the series - and after a phone call to Stroud himself the wheels were in motion for the show to go into production with Cornish at the helm.

""They're right in my wheelhouse, they have all the things I love and they just have these really brilliant original ideas at the core,"" he says of the stories. ""The first of which is ghosts can kill you by touching you.""

He continues: ""The second is quite an old-school supernatural idea that young people are more sensitive to ghosts and the supernatural than older people; the third is that these agencies build up that employ the young people to fight the ghosts; the fourth is that ghosts can be repelled with iron and salts and these fairly sort of old-school analogue methods.

""So I'd never come across a ghost story with this new set of rules that turned it into an action-adventure story. Also, the central characters of Lockwood - Lucy, George - are so compulsive.""

While this was a fresh take on the supernatural for Cornish, it certainly wasn't his first, though he'll be hoping it's better received than his first one was.

838;'Faulty and ambiguous' government guidance partially to blame for Grenfell Tower tragedy, Michael Gove admits;Sunday 29 January 2023 03:58, UK;[];['grenfell tower'];['guidance', 'mr', 'system', 'grenfell', 'partially', 'blame', 'ambiguous', 'tower', 'michael', 'companies', 'tragedy', 'gove', 'faulty', 'final', 'inquiry', 'department'];"The government is partially to blame for the Grenfell Tower tragedy because of ""faulty and ambiguous"" government guidance, Michael Gove has said.

The housing secretary added the guidance allowed ""unscrupulous people to exploit a broken system in a way that led to tragedy"".

He made the admission in an interview with The Sunday Times as he placed a deadline on unsafe blocks.

The fire at the residential tower block in North Kensington, west London, in June 2017 killed 72 people and triggered a public inquiry.

The inquiry, chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, is yet to deliver its final report,

Evidence to the inquiry showed official guidance was widely seen to allow highly flammable cladding on tall buildings.

When asked if accepted the rules were wrong Mr Gove replied: ""Yes.

""There was a system of regulation that was faulty. The government did not think hard enough, or police effectively enough, the whole system of building safety. Undoubtedly.""

""I believe that (the guidance) was so faulty and ambiguous that it allowed unscrupulous people to exploit a broken system in a way that led to tragedy,"" Mr Gove added.

It comes after the inquiry's final hearing in November heard that firms appeared to have used the inquiry to ""position themselves for any legal proceedings"" that may follow it, instead of showing remorse.

Image: Michael Gove has admitted guidance was 'faulty and ambiguous'

In closing submissions, lead counsel Richard Millett KC accused companies of a ""merry go round of buck-passing"" in order to protect their own interests.

On Monday, the housing secretary will announce a six-week deadline for developers to sign a government contract to fix their unsafe towers - or be banned from the market.

""Those who haven't (signed) will face consequences. They will not be able to build new homes,"" Mr Gove added.

The minister will use the so-called ""responsible actor scheme"", to be established in the spring, to block such companies from getting planning or building control approval.

Sky News learnt that major companies including Barratt Developments and Persimmon are preparing for the imminent signing of a legally binding contract with the government that could ultimately cost the industry £5bn or more.

One executive said they expected the final contract to be signed and unveiled as soon as next week, although they cautioned that the timing remained fluid.

Last year, dozens of developers signed a pledge to fix buildings constructed since the early 1990s, with revisions to the deal with government in recent weeks having focused on the scope of companies' exposure.

The Grenfell inquiry heard many of the companies involved in the tragedy have failed to accept blame for their role in the events prior to the disaster, showing what Mr Millett called a ""lack of respect"" for the victims and their families.

The inquiry also heard from Jason Beer KC, for the department of levelling up, housing and communities, who said the department ""apologises unreservedly"" for its failure to recognise weaknesses in the regulatory system.

""The department recognises that it failed to appreciate it held an important stewardship role over the regime and that as a result it failed to grasp the opportunities to assess whether the system was working as intended,"" he said.

839;Netanyahu vows to 'strengthen' West Bank settlements after shooting attacks;Sunday 29 January 2023 02:46, UK;[];['benjamin netanyahu', 'israel', 'jerusalem', 'palestinian territories'];['west', 'shootings', 'bank', 'netanyahu', 'israeli', 'strengthen', 'east', 'shooting', 'response', 'palestinian', 'jerusalem', 'vows', 'attacks', 'security', 'settlements'];"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he plans to ""strengthen the settlements"" in the West Bank in response to two shootings which left seven people dead and five wounded.

Mr Netanyahu's announcement threatens to further raise tensions after one of the bloodiest months in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in several years.

In the first attack, a Palestinian gunman killed seven people when he opened fire outside a synagogue in Neve Yaakov in East Jerusalem on Friday.

Hours later two people were wounded when a 13-year-old Palestinian boy opened fire on a group of five civilians on Saturday.

Mr Netanyahu's office has said the country's security cabinet has agreed to seal off the home of Friday's gunman ahead of its demolition.

The security office also plans to cancel social security and health benefits for the families of the attackers, step up efforts to collect illegal weapons and make it easier for Israelis to obtain weapons.

Mr Netanyahu's announcement also said Israel will take new steps to ""strengthen the settlements"" this week.

However it gave no further details.

There has been no immediate response from Washington.

The Biden administration, which condemned Friday's shooting, opposes settlement construction in East Jerusalem and the West Bank - lands sought by the Palestinians for a future state.

The topic is likely to be high on the agenda as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives on Monday for talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials.

It comes as Mr Netanyahu could come under pressure from members of his government, a collection of religious and ultranationalist politicians, to take even tougher action.

Such steps could risk triggering more violence and potentially drag in the Hamas militant group in Gaza.

The weekend shootings followed a deadly Israeli raid in the West Bank on Thursday that killed nine Palestinians, most of them militants.

In response, Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip fired a barrage of rockets into Israel, triggering a series of Israeli air strikes in response.

In all, 32 Palestinians have been killed in fighting this month.

It remains unclear whether the Israeli steps will be effective.

The Palestinian attackers in the weekend shootings both appear to have acted alone and were not part of organised militant groups.

Friday's shooting left seven Israelis dead, including a 14-year-old boy. and three wounded before the gunman was killed by police.

It was the deadliest attack on Israelis in 15 years.

In response to the shooting, Israeli police beefed up activities throughout East Jerusalem and said they had arrested 42 people, including family members, who were connected to the gunman.

But later on Saturday, a 13-year-old Palestinian boy opened fire elsewhere in East Jerusalem, wounding an Israeli man and his son, aged 47 and 23, paramedics said. Both were fully conscious and in moderate to serious condition in hospital, the medics added.

As police rushed to the scene, two passers-by with licensed weapons shot and overpowered the 13-year-old attacker, police said. Officers confiscated his handgun and took the wounded teenager to hospital.

Both Palestinian attackers behind the shootings on Friday and Saturday came from East Jerusalem.

Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem hold permanent residency status, allowing them to work and move freely throughout Israel, but they suffer from subpar public services and are not allowed to vote in national elections.

840;Ukraine war: How hidden landmines, tripwires and booby traps pose lethal danger for years to come;Sunday 29 January 2023 03:14, UK;['michael drummond', '@mikerdrummond'];['ukraine'];['danger', 'ukrainian', 'traps', 'landmines', 'mines', 'forces', 'using', 'pose', 'templeton', 'ukraine', 'lethal', 'tripwires', 'hidden', 'minerelated', 'come', 'war', '2022'];"After years of bloody conflict the scarred Ukrainian landscape is riddled with landmines, posing a deadly threat to civilians that will persist long after the war ends.

With more than 40% of the country contaminated with mines by one estimate, Ukraine is believed to now be the most mined country in the world.

Newly-liberated towns can remain dangerous long after the last Russian forces have been forced out, with Ukrainian defenders discovering tripwires and booby traps as well as anti-tank explosives ready to detonate.

""Contamination is massive,"" Kateryna Templeton from the Mines Advisory Group tells Sky News.

""It's not even comparable, I would say, to Syria or Afghanistan. It's really massive.""

International law prohibits and restricts the use of various mines, particularly those designed to target people.

Russian forces have been accused by Human Rights Watch of using banned anti-personnel mines in the eastern Kharkiv region.

A broad spectrum of mines have been deployed in Ukraine including some that had never been seen in combat before.

Ms Templeton continued: ""You will see anti-tank mines, anti-personnel mines, booby traps, you will see lots of unexploded ordnance, you will see cluster munitions.

""Everything you can think of you will see in Ukraine.""

Image: Unexploded ordnance and landmines are seen by the main road to Kherson in November 2022

Huge rise in mine-related casualties since February 2022 invasion

Some landmines in Ukraine pre-date February 2022, with Russian-backed forces in Donetsk and Luhansk using various devices in 2014-2015 and sporadically in the following years, according to Human Rights Watch.

More recently, Russian forces have placed victim-activated booby traps as they retreated from towns they had occupied during the early weeks of the full-scale invasion.

According to MAG, in the six years between 2014 and 2020 there were 1,190 mine-related casualties in Ukraine.

Between 24 February, 2022 and 10 January, 2023 - less than one year - there have been 611 known mine-related casualties.

Following one incident, two Ukrainian soldiers who had amputations were fitted with state-of-the-art bionic arms made in the UK.

As well as directly causing injury and death, mines can render swathes of land inaccessible or more dangerous.

Agricultural production is reportedly being affected by the use of landmines in fields and on rural paths and roads.

Post-war clean-up to take years

Ms Templeton says that MAG do not focus on investigating which side is placing the mines, instead they try to make sure parties are not using banned anti-personnel mines and look for opportunities to clear contaminated land so that people can live safer lives.

The organisation started their response by sending in a team in April 2022 and began working with local partners.

Ukrainians will be trained on how to clean up mined areas, supervised by experts from MAG.

But with the conflict having gone on for nearly a decade in some areas, it will be a painstaking and deadly process taking many years to decontaminate every inch of Ukrainian soil.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129040206/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-how-hidden-landmines-tripwires-and-booby-traps-pose-lethal-danger-for-years-to-come-12795912
841;The deadly assault on Tyre Nichols draws painful parallels for Americans who are no strangers to videos of police violence;Sunday 29 January 2023 03:50, UK;['martha kelner', '@marthakelner'];['tennessee', 'tyre nichols'];['king', 'officers', 'mr', 'rodney', 'tyre', 'deadly', 'killed', 'violence', 'draws', 'videos', 'black', 'strangers', 'nichols', 'video', 'white', 'assault', 'parallels', 'painful'];"When watching the horrific video of Tyre Nichols being kicked and punched by police officers, many minds in America were transported back to footage of another black man being beaten in similar circumstances more than 30 years ago.

The video of Rodney King is grainy and shaky, before the era of police-worn body cameras and mobile phones.

It was filmed, fortuitously, by a plumber who had bought a new camcorder to capture his friend running a marathon but happened to see Mr King from the window of his apartment, being attacked by officers.

Mr King had also been pulled over in his car, in Los Angeles, and was mercilessly beaten. The video of his attack was picked up by local and then national news broadcasters and was shown on television for days.

It was the first time America had been forced to confront such savagery from their living rooms, the brutalising of a black man by those who swore to protect.

Mr King survived the beating, but the video of the deadly assault on Tyre Nichols has painful parallels, felt especially keenly by Mr King's family.

""People wonder where the anger comes from, this is where if you see someone time and time again, who looks like you, your dad, your brother, how would you feel? It's a pattern and we're still here,"" his daughter, Lora Dene King, told NBC News after watching the Nichols footage released by police,

The video and the subsequent acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers who had been criminally charged in relation to the assault on Mr King sparked violent protests in LA and beyond.

There was, for the first time, very clear video evidence to confirm the lived experience and discrimination of black communities by the police and people demanded change.

The deaths of black people at the hands of law enforcement are now, more often, caught on mobile phone cameras or with police body cameras.

There is a heightened sense of accountability for police, but Ms Dene King believes reform still has a long way to go.

""I hope no one has to explain this to their children. I hope one day we can look back and realise just how ignorant we were. We are from here, we live here, we should be working together so that this never happens. It seems like it's no change except for hashtag with clear video,"" she said.

America continues to wrestle with its police problem and death at the hands of law enforcement is shockingly routine.

Outrage as video shows Tyre Nichols beaten by officers before his death

How the violent arrest of Tyre Nichols unfolded

Last year, 1,123 people were killed by police in the US, making it one of the deadliest years on record for police violence, according to figures from non-profit research group Mapping Police Violence.

Image: Breonna Taylor, 26, was killed on 13 March 2020. Pic: Facebook

Those figures suggest an average of more than three people a day are being killed, and black people are almost three times more likely to be killed by police than white people.

In 2014, Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, was shot dead by a white police officer who was not charged.

In 2020, Breonna Taylor, a medical worker, was shot dead by officers during a botched raid on her apartment.

There are a string of other high profile tragedies but it was the murder of George Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis which revived the Black Lives Matter movement and prompted an explosive wave of protest.

Public focus sharpened on a system infected by violence and discrimination, causing police reform laws to be passed with haste in the months following Mr Floyd's death.

Body-camera footage is now more routinely made public, whether it exonerates the officers or damns them as in the case of Tyre Nichols.

Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton said the beating of Mr Nichols was racially-motivated even though the five officers charged with his murder are also black.

He said: ""These black guys thought they could get away with it doing it to a black guy. You know you couldn't get away with doing that in Tennessee to a white guy. You'll find out you ain't getting away with it doing it to a black guy.""

America is still demanding change and protests continue in cities across the country. But the swift charging of the officers involved in the beating of Tyre Nichols and transparency around the video has perhaps encouraged them to remain peaceful and convinced some that justice is under way.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129040206/http://news.sky.com/story/the-deadly-assault-on-tyre-nichols-draws-painful-parallels-for-americans-who-are-no-strangers-to-videos-of-police-violence-12798087
842;Boris Johnson told to stop asking Richard Sharp for financial advice days before he was made BBC chair - reports;Sunday 29 January 2023 05:00, UK;[];['boris johnson'];['sharp', 'chair', 'mr', 'richard', 'boris', 'advice', 'johnson', 'blyth', 'days', 'reports', 'bbc', 'financial', 'sam', 'stop', 'process', 'loan', 'told'];"Boris Johnson was reportedly told to stop asking Richard Sharp for ""advice"" about his ""personal financial matters"" just days before he was announced as the new BBC chairman.

Mr Johnson, who was prime minister at the time, was warned by officials to stop discussing his financial arrangements with Mr Sharp on 22 December 2020, according to The Sunday Times.

Mr Sharp was due to be announced as BBC chair on 6 January 2021.

The former banker has been facing calls to stand down as BBC chairman after it emerged that in late 2020 he had introduced Sam Blyth to Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to discuss whether Mr Blyth, a distant cousin of Mr Johnson whom Mr Sharp has known for more than 40 years, could act as a guarantor for a loan facility for the prime minister.

Mr Sharp previously said that he will remain in place, with the BBC chairman due to be grilled by MPs on the controversy next month.

A spokesperson for the former prime minister said Mr Sharp has ""never given any financial advice to Boris Johnson, nor has Mr Johnson sought any financial advice from him"".

They added: ""Neither Mr Johnson nor anyone acting on his behalf was ever aware that Sam Blyth was being considered for any role at the British Council, nor did Mr Johnson have any discussions with Sam Blyth or anyone else about any such role.

""Neither Mr Johnson nor anyone acting on his behalf spoke to anyone in the FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) regarding Mr Blyth for any public appointment.""

The spokesperson said that ""throughout this process, as the material The Sunday Times has obtained demonstrates, Mr Johnson followed advice and took the necessary steps to ensure probity. All declarations were made properly"".

Timeline November 2020:

According to the Sunday Times the loan guarantee was first suggested by Canadian millionaire Sam Blyth during a dinner with Richard Sharp. Early December 2020:

In early December, Richard Sharp put Sam Blyth in contact with the Cabinet Secretary, Simon Case. Late 2020:

Before the end of the year, Richard Sharp and Sam Blyth met with Boris Johnson for dinner at his country residence, Chequers. They insist the prime minister's finances were not discussed. January 2021:

At the start of January, the government announced Richard Sharp as the preferred candidate to be BBC chairman.

The newspaper, citing a leaked Cabinet Office memo, said advice was issued by top civil servant Mr Case after Mr Johnson and Mr Sharp sought out advice on accepting the £800,000 loan from Mr Blyth.

Mr Johnson reportedly secured the loan in February 2021.

The paper quotes advice issued by Mr Case, which stated: ""Given the imminent announcement of Richard Sharp as the new BBC chair, it is important that you no longer ask his advice about your personal financial matters.""

Public appointments commissioner William Shawcross has already said that he plans to investigate Mr Sharp's appointment as BBC chairman, following the first set of reports last week.

BBC chairman Richard Sharp confident he was 'appointed on merit' after Boris Johnson loan row

Chairman of the BBC - What is the role? The Chairman of the BBC is the head of the BBC board – on a salary of £160,000. They are responsible for maintaining the independence of the BBC while overseeing the functioning of the corporation to fulfill its mission. The chairman is also in charge of the process for appointing the director-general and can dismiss the person in this role. They also act as the corporation's most senior representative to Parliament and the government, including the devolved administrations. Speaking to Sky News yesterday, Roger Mosey, a former head of TV news at the BBC, said it was a job with ""two directions"". He said while it is ""the most important role for the accountability of the BBC to the public"", it is not one which is involved in the BBC's journalism. But Mr Mosey pointed out that it is not uncommon for the chair to be a political appointment and that this is ""nothing new"".

Mr Sharp told BBC News last week he was ""comfortable"" with the way the process had been carried out.

The paper also reports that Mr Blyth had appeared on a Foreign Office list of four recommended candidates during the search for the chief executive of the British Council, with his family ties to Mr Johnson not revealed to senior figures at the council.

Mr Blyth told the paper he ruled himself out on 7 December 2020 and did not formally apply.

""I believe my name may have been suggested by civil servants who were trying to identify potential candidates at the search stage of the appointment process,"" he said.

Liberal Democrat chief whip Wendy Chamberlain called on the government to publish Mr Johnson's internal register of interests.

""The public are sick of these endless lies and Conservative cover-ups. This government must come clean and publish all relevant documents, including Boris Johnson's internal register of interests, so we can get to the bottom of this.""

Mr Sharp said last week that ""having had a discussion with the cabinet secretary about avoiding conflict, and the perception of conflict, I felt comfortable and I still feel there was no conflict because at that stage what I was seeking to do was ensure that the process was followed exactly by the book, and that the process hadn't started, of any kind, in terms of any support that Sam (Blyth) was going to provide to the prime minister"".

""Personally, if I see even one symbolic protest in Babol, I will support it,"" he wrote on Twitter.

The nature-loving student was shot dead by security forces during a demonstration just two days later - protests had broken out over the death of a young woman in police custody who was arrested for wearing her hijab ""incorrectly"".

Months on, his family say they are still being harassed by the authorities in an attempt to silence them about what happened. It is an experience that human rights experts say is common for those whose loved ones died as a result of state violence in Iran.

For some families like Mohammad Hassan's, however, remaining silent is not an option. And social media is providing them with a way to memorialise and seek justice for the dead.

Mohammad Hassan Torkaman's story

Mohammad Hassan was a typical 26-year-old. He loved the outdoors, and could often be found exploring the forest with his friends. He was fascinated by space too, covering his home with posters of stars and far-flung galaxies.

His fluffy white Persian cat, Pashmak, was his pride and joy.

Image: Mohammed Hassan and his cat, Pashmak. Pic: Twitter

His brother says he was a calm, kind person who had great ambitions.

""He had big ideas and wanted to make an impact in the future,"" his brother said.

Mohammed Hassan had moved to Babol five years ago to study at university. So on 21 September, his family in Shahin Shahr, Isfahan, didn't know he had gone out to protest.

It was only when they received a worried phone call from one of his friends that they realised something awful had happened.

""I was in a terrible state of shock, so I remember everything like a nightmare,"" his brother said.

The friend told them that he had been calling Mohammad Hassan after he failed to turn up to his house as expected. An unknown voice eventually picked up and said that Mohammad Hassan had been shot.

His father, a veteran and former prisoner of war during the conflict between Iran and Iraq, was so shocked by the news that he suffered a stroke and was taken into intensive care.

His brother says that when he went to see Mohammad Hassan's body in the morgue, he saw a bullet wound in his head.

For three days, the authorities refused to release the body and only did so on the condition that the family would remain quiet about where he had been shot and held the funeral under strict security.

But even then, their ordeal was far from over.

""The events for the third and the seventh days were held under watchful eyes of the agents,"" his brother said.

At the 40th day ceremony, the situation escalated.

""They were attacked by the security forces, plain clothes militia using stun grenades, tear gas, rubber bullets, paintballs and batons. Many were arrested and wounded,"" his brother said.

It's now been months since Mohammad Hassan's death and the memorial gatherings that followed. But relatives say the authorities are still harassing them.

""We are more or less threatened, we are monitored and controlled, some days they follow us, some nights they are stationed near our home,"" his brother said.

Digital memorialisation

Azadeh Pourzand, a human rights researcher at SOAS University of London, explains that Iranian authorities have a history of treating families of those killed by the state in this way as they fear the impact the killing could have.

""It's ironic that the regime is so strong with its state violence as a repressive regime but is scared of the dead bodies it creates,"" she told Sky News.

""It's not new to see the burial ceremonies for victims of state violence being disrupted in this way. It's used as a tool to further harass and silence families,"" she said.

Azadeh says that for many years, this meant that the only cases that would garner attention were those in which the victim was already publicly known or of a certain societal status. It was therefore largely left to human rights organisations like the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center to document the stories of all of the others who died at the hands of the state.

Since 2002, the centre has run the Omid Memorial project which is a digital archive of all of those who have been killed by the state and acts as an online memorial.

""The project's mission is to ensure that all victims of the state's violation of the right to life are memorialised, that society acknowledges the harm done to them and their loved ones, to help start their healing process in the absence of justice,"" said Roya Boroumand, who runs the centre.

The advent of social media, however, has meant that individuals are now empowered to do this themselves in ways that they were previously unable to. It means that social media pages dedicated to the memory of those who have been killed in Iran are increasingly common online.

Many of these accounts are run by bereaved family members. Three months after Mohammad Hassan's death, two of his relatives set up Twitter pages that post on a daily basis, almost exclusively about Mohammad Hassan. They now have a combined following of over 27,000.

Image: This digital image of Mohammed Hassan has been shared on pages dedicated to his memory and across social media

Among the posts are pictures of Mohammad Hassan as a child, as well as his gravestone and memorial shrine. Many include anecdotes about Mohammad Hassan and calls for justice.

The hashtag of Mohammad Hassan's full name in Farsi, which features in each of the posts, has been tweeted over 143,000 times according to data collected by social listening platform TalkWalker.

Image: One of the posts shared in memory of Mohammed Hassan, which was originally written in Farsi describes how the cemetery he is buried in was blocked off by security agents

""It is my duty and my family's duty to be the voice of my brother's unjustly shed blood. My father was the one who stood in front of Iraqi soldiers and defended his country. We learned our courage from him,"" Mohammad Hassan's brother said.

Other accounts dedicated to memorialising all of those who have died have also sprung up.

One page was initially created to pay tribute to the 1,500 protesters killed in 2019. The account now creates and shares memorials for those who have died during the recent protests and for those who have been executed. It has 27,000 followers on Instagram and a further 7,000 on Twitter.

""The government of Iran wants these things not to be mentioned at all, not to be heard at all. The government media denies this at all,"" the page's operator told Sky News.

""I am the voice of their grieving families,"" they said.

""What we are seeing here is grassroots archiving and memorialising,"" said Azadeh Pourzand.

She explains that these memorials are also about achieving justice for those who have died.

""The ultimate goal is: we are not going to forget and we are not going to forgive. We're not going to let our loved ones' blood go to waste. We are going to keep it alive, we are going to remember and we are going to seek justice,"" she told Sky News.

Ms Wells said: ""I believe in my heart that my son was on assignment from God. He finished his assignment and God took him back home.

""Even though this tragedy happened to my son, I truly believe that there is going to be a greater good that comes out of this.

Ms Wells went on to say that the officers she believes killed her son had ""shamed their own families"" and continued: ""You shamed your communities. You just brought a bad taste to everybody's mouth.

""I hate the fact that it was five black men that actually did this to another black man. My son probably was their age.

""They just brought disgrace to themselves. I'm not an evil person, my son is not an evil person.... I pray for (the officers') families, because their families didn't deserve any of this either.""

Ms Wells and Mr Nichols' stepfather also repeated their call for people to protest in a non-violent way.

Mr Nichol's mother earlier said in the same interview: ""Tyre was a beautiful person, he was full of life, as you can see he loved to skateboard, he loved to watch the sunsets. He was a great dad.

""He was just a good person. There's no perfect person in this world, but he was close to it.""

Ms Wells has spoken after Memphis Police announced the SCORPION (Street Crimes Operations to Restore Peace in Our Neighbourhoods) unit, that the five officers charged with murder over the father-of-one's death were members of, has been ""permanently deactivated"".

Memphis Police said in a statement: ""In the process of listening intently to the family of Tyre Nichols, community leaders, and the uninvolved officers who have done quality work in their assignments, it is in the best interest of all to permanently deactivate the SCORPION unit.

""The officers currently assigned to the unit agree unreservedly with this next step.

""While the heinous actions of a few casts a cloud of dishonour on the title SCORPION, it is imperative that we, the Memphis Police Department take proactive steps in the healing process for all impacted.""

The move comes after Memphis Police released bodycam footage showing Mr Nichols screaming for his mother while being beaten by officers.

The footage shows police attacked the 29-year-old for three minutes while shouting profanities at him.

Mr Nichols was 80 yards (73 metres) from his family home, according to his mother.

Police have released four separate videos cut into one hour-long clip, including police bodycam footage and footage from a CCTV camera.

Five officers have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, including assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression over Mr Nichols' death.

In the footage of the attack, one camera shows the initial police stop at an intersection in Memphis, Tennessee.

""I'm going to baton the f*** out of you,"" one officer can be heard saying. His body camera shows him raise his baton while at least one other officer holds Mr Nichols.

After the first officer roughly pulls Mr Nichols out of his car just after 8:20pm on 7 January this year, the FedEx worker can be heard saying ""I didn't do anything"" as a group of officers begins to wrestle him to the ground.

""Get on the ground!,"" one officer yells, as another is heard shouting: ""Tase him! Tase him!""

The father-of-one calmly replied soon after being wrestled to the pavement: ""OK, I'm on the ground.""

What is Scorpion, the police unit at the centre of Tyre Nichols' death?

Timeline of violent arrest

Arrest video is sickening indictment of policing that night

The camera is briefly obscured and then Mr Nichols can be seen running as an officer fires a Taser at him. The officers then start chasing Mr Nichols.

He is then punched, kicked and hit with a baton. After the beating, officers mill about for several minutes while Mr Nichols lies propped up against the car, then slumps onto the street.

Emergency workers with what looks like medical equipment attend, but do not immediately intervene.

He died on 10 January, three days after the violent arrest.

The officers involved have been dismissed by Memphis Police Department's Chief of Police, Cerelyn Davis.

Ms Davis, who became the force's first black female boss in 2021, previously called for ""sweeping changes and police reform"" in the aftermath of the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

In Tyre Nichols, people are perhaps seeing an everyday man who encountered an everyday problem James Matthews US correspondent @jamesmatthewsky It is now known as the Tyre Nichols memorial site. Google Maps had this street south-east of Memphis as Castlegate Lane before the video release of Tyre's fatal beating. The day after, it was given a sat-nav rebrand. Navigate there now and you find the Google app has refreshed to incorporate recent, horrific history - and to pay its respects to a Memphis man lost to police brutality. Teddy bears and flowers lie in tribute to Mr Nichols on a street now returned to suburban calm, except for occasional ""drive-by"" journalists in a place that will always be news. Their weekend focus shifted to the city centre, specifically the building that bears the slogan: ""Join the Best in Blue"" - a Memphis misnomer for the demonstrators who gathered outside the headquarters of its police headquarters late on Saturday afternoon. ""Amen"" was the shout as they learned of the disbandment of SCORPION, the police unit implicated in the murder of Tyre Nichols. A trumpeter played the tune to ""We Shall Overcome"", and the mood of the crowd felt like victory. It's how they see it, in some measure. They feel momentum in the move for change in US police culture, but they have felt it before - before Tyre Nichols was killed. Change, they know, is a long game. Members of this gathered crowd showed up to sustain it. Parents, white and black, told us it was their fight on behalf of their children. A struggle for nothing less than their safety. Indeed, a striking aspect spanning two days of peaceful demonstration here has been the presence of families in numbers higher than you'd typically see on this subject matter. They have turned out here, young and old, to protest on Interstate 55 on Friday night and in the city centre on Saturday. In the story of Tyre Nichols - father, Fedex worker, skateboarder, photographer - perhaps they see an everyday man who encountered an everyday problem affecting everyone. Still.

Meanwhile, influential civil rights campaigner Al Sharpton said the US has a ""new clock"" on police accountability following the quick arrest and firing of five officers charged over the death of Mr Nichols.

Speaking at a rally in Harlem, New York, Reverend Sharpton also rejected the idea that there was no race element to the fatal beating of Mr Nichols by the officers just because they themselves are black.

Making a speech at a weekly National Action Network rally, he said: ""So there's a new precedent set now 'cos this black women police chief messed you up now - 'cos she said I'm not waiting on nothing - arrest them, fire them.

""You now got a new clock on police accountability. We don't want to hear no year investigation.""

Addressing the involvement of race, he said: ""One person said to me well at least it ain't about race.

""I said the race part of it is those black guys thought they could get away with doing it to a black guy.

""You know you couldn't get away with doing that in Tennessee to a white guy - and you won't get away with doing it to a black guy either.""

Meanwhile, at a news conference of city leaders held on Saturday, state representative Joe Towns Jr, echoed the comments of Reverend Sharpton on the force's prompt investigation.

He also said police chief Davis had his full support, praising her for taking ""swift action"".

The comments came as a memorial fund set up in the aftermath of Mr Nichols topped $535,000 (£433,000).

The GoFundMe page, set up by Mr Nichols' mother, is aimed at helping to pay for a memorial skate park in his honour, as well as to allow his family time off from their jobs to grieve and seek justice.

Protests are taking place in at least nine cities across the US - including Memphis - after the bodycam footage was released.

Mr Nichols' mother had earlier warned supporters of the ""horrific"" nature of the video but pleaded for peace saying ""tearing up the streets"" is ""not what my son stood for"".

US President Joe Biden said he was ""outraged and deeply pained to see the horrific video of the beating that resulted in Tyre Nichols' death"".

""It is yet another painful reminder of the profound fear and trauma, the pain, and the exhaustion that black and brown Americans experience every single day,"" he added.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129053215/http://news.sky.com/story/tyre-nichols-mother-says-shes-not-going-to-stop-until-those-responsible-for-sons-death-face-justice-as-police-unit-is-disbanded-12798029

Speaking to party leaders at the New Hampshire Republicans' annual meeting in Salem, the former president insisted he was motivated to win as he embarked on his third White House bid which he announced in November.

""We're starting right here as a candidate for president,"" he announced. ""I'm more angry now, and I'm more committed now, than I ever was.""

In contrast to the raucous rallies in front of thousands of devotees that Mr Trump often holds, Saturday's events were notably muted.

In Columbia, South Carolina, Mr Trump spoke to about 200 people in the state's capitol building, with Governor Henry McMaster and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina flanking him.

Mr Trump's sluggish start to his campaign has left some questioning his commitment to running again - but he dismissed the speculation by saying ""we have huge rallies planned, bigger than ever before"".

Once the undisputed centre of gravity in the Republican Party, an increasing number of elected officials have expressed

concerns about Mr Trump's ability to beat Democratic President Joe Biden.

Several Republicans are considering whether to launch their own White House bids, including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, widely seen as the biggest threat to Mr Trump.

Top Republicans in both states that the former president visited - including New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley - are among those weighing bids of their own.

At both stops on Saturday, Mr Trump echoed some of the themes of his 2016 campaign, including sharply criticising illegal immigration at the US-Mexico border and China.

But he also emphasised social issues, perhaps in response to Mr DeSantis, whose relentless focus on culture wars has helped build his national profile.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had resisted earlier calls from opposition parties to sack Mr Zahawi following reports that the Tory chairman had paid a penalty as part of an estimated £4.8m settlement dispute with HMRC.

He had instead asked his new ethics adviser - Sir Laurie Magnus - to assess whether the settlement amounted to a breach of the ministerial code.

In a letter written by Sir Laurie to the PM this morning following the conclusion of the investigation, the ethics adviser said Mr Zahawi had ""shown insufficient regard for the general principles of the Ministerial Code"" and not fulfilled the requirements of being an ""honest, open and an exemplary leader"".

In a second letter written by the PM to Mr Zahawi following Sir Laurie's findings, Mr Sunak said it is ""clear that there has been a serious breach of the Ministerial Code"" and announced the removal of the Tory chairman from his ministerial position.

Zahawi fired as Tory party chairman - politics latest

Mr Zahawi had faced pressure in recent days to quit as questions swirled about his finances even after he released a statement to ""clear up some of the confusion"".

He admitted he paid what HM Revenue & Customs said ""was due"" after it ""disagreed about the exact allocation"" of shares in the YouGov polling company he co-founded, an error he said was ""careless"" not deliberate.

But he did not disclosed the size of the settlement or whether he paid a fine.

In the correspondence to Mr Sunak released by Downing Street, Sir Laurie said his overall judgement was that the ""omissions"" by Mr Zahawi regarding his tax affairs ""constitute a serious failure to meet the standards set out in the ministerial code"".

In the four-page report to Mr Sunak, dated 29 January, Sir Laurie says:

• Mr Zahawi's contact with HMRC began in April 2021 but he did not declare it

• He failed to declare the ongoing HMRC investigation when appointed as education secretary in October 2021

• The Tory chairman still did not mention the probe when appointed as chancellor in July 2022

• His ""delay in correcting an untrue public statement"" made in July 2022 - in which he said reports were ""inaccurate, unfair and clearly smears"" - was ""inconsistent with the requirement for openness""

• Mr Zahawi reached an in-principle settlement with HMRC in August 2022 - with a settlement in September 2022 along with a penalty - which was not disclosed until January 2023

• Mr Zahawi ""failed to meet the requirement to declare any interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict"" by not declaring HMRC's ongoing investigation before July 2022

• The Tory chairman ""should have understood"" that HMRC were investigating ""a serious matter""

• He ""failed to disclose relevant information - in this case the nature of the investigation and its outcome in a penalty - at the time of his appointment""

• The cabinet office ""was not in a position to inform the appointing prime minister"" about Mr Zahawi's tax affairs as he failed to disclose the relevant information to the department

• Mr Zahawi's conduct ""has fallen below the high standards"" that a PM should expect from ministers

• The Tory chairman showed ""insufficient regard"" for the Ministerial Code

Informing Mr Zahawi of his decision to remove him from government, Mr Sunak wrote: ""When I became prime minister last year, I pledged that the government I lead would have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level.

The PM added that Mr Zahawi should be ""extremely proud"" of his ""wide-ranging achievements in government over the last five years"", particularly crediting his ""successful oversight of the COVID-19 vaccine procurement and deployment programme"".

He added that he is concerned ""about the conduct from some of the fourth estate in recent weeks"", in a reference to the media.

Mr Zahawi said: ""It has been, after being blessed with my loving family, the privilege of my life to serve in successive governments and make what I believe to have been a tangible difference to the country I love.""

But be in no doubt, this whole affair raises questions about the prime minister's judgement.

Firstly, did Rishi Sunak look hard enough into allegations around Nadhim Zahawi's tax affairs when he appointed him to his cabinet?

Stories about the now ex-chairman's business background have swirled around Westminster for months.

While Downing Street denies any formal red flags were raised, it's fair to ask whether a prime minister who promised to bring integrity back to government should have been more proactive in establishing the facts before making this appointment.

Secondly, should Rishi Sunak have acted more quickly in commissioning the ethics adviser inquiry after more specific concerns were raised in the last fortnight?

Remember, it was just 11 days ago that the prime minister told MPs in the Commons that Nadhim Zahawi had addressed all the issues in full.

Thirdly, should Rishi Sunak have sacked Nadhim Zahawi straight away rather than waiting for the ethics adviser's report?

Downing Street will emphasise the need for due process, but at the point Nadhim Zahawi admitted to paying a tax penalty while chancellor, it seemed clear to many that he had committed a sackable offence.

Significant storm clouds are hanging over the government as the prime minister looks to overturn Labour's commanding lead in the polls.

Despite Mr Sunak trying to distance himself from the turbulent premiership of Boris Johnson, rows over propriety and standards have continued.

Here, Sky News looks at the scandals and U-turns during his time as PM - including his sacking of Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi.

Suella Braverman

Just a few days into his premiership, Mr Sunak was under significant pressure over his reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary after a former party chair claimed she had committed ""multiple breaches"" of the ministerial code.

The week before, Ms Braverman had resigned from the same role in former PM Liz Truss's government after using her personal email address to forward sensitive government documents, breaking the rules ministers have to abide by.

But Mr Sunak put her back into the Home Office on the following Tuesday, and stood by the decision after being pressed on it in the Commons the next day.

Former Tory Party chair Sir Jake Berry alleged ""there were multiple breaches of the ministerial code"", while Nadhim Zahawi said officials within the Cabinet Office had warned against bringing her back due to security breaches.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Sunak of having done a ""grubby deal"" with Ms Braverman - a figure popular on the right of the party - in order to secure the keys to Number 10.

But the PM resisted the calls to sack Ms Braverman and she remains in post as home secretary.

Gavin Williamson

Mr Sunak's judgement came under further scrutiny just a few weeks later after cabinet minister Sir Gavin Williamson quit, vowing to clear his name over bullying claims.

Sir Gavin, who at the time was attending cabinet as a minister without portfolio, was accused of abusive behaviour towards MPs and civil servants - but denies any wrongdoing.

He was accused of sending abusive text messages to Wendy Morton, the former chief whip under Liz Truss, complaining that he and other colleagues had been excluded from the Queen's funeral for political reasons.

The prime minister tried to let an independent investigation into the matter run its course, defending Sir Gavin in media interviews for ""expressing regret"" while condemning his language.

But Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper accused Mr Sunak of ignoring the complaint and called for Sir Gavin to be sacked.

Sir Gavin was previously fired as defence secretary in May 2019 over allegations of leaking info from National Security Council meetings, and lost his job as education secretary after two years when Mr Johnson decided to drop him in a cabinet reshuffle.

But Mr Sunak did not pull the trigger to axe one of his biggest backers behind the scenes, with Sir Gavin opting to quit himself over the row.

Dominic Raab

In November, numerous allegations about Justice Secretary Dominic Raab's behaviour surfaced relating to his previous stint in the role under Mr Johnson, with staff reportedly offered a ""route out"" of his department when he was reinstated in October.

Civil servants who worked with him told The Guardian he was a ""very rude and aggressive"" boss while another report claimed the justice secretary had acquired the nickname ""The Incinerator"" because he ""burns through"" staff.

Despite the allegations, Mr Sunak stood by his close ally, telling reporters: ""I don't recognise that characterisation of Dominic and I'm not aware of any formal complaints about him.""

But additional weight was added to the claims following a report by Bloomberg that Simon Case, the head of the civil service, was told by senior officials of concerns about Mr Raab's abrasive treatment of junior staff and took steps to try to improve his behaviour.

A Cabinet Office spokesperson at the time said: ""We have no record of any formal complaints.""

It was revealed that Mr Raab has reportedly been the subject of formal bullying complaints by at least 24 civil servants.

Eight formal allegations have been levelled against the deputy prime minister and are being investigated by senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC.

But the PM has resisted calls to suspend Mr Raab while the probe is conducted.

Nadhim Zahawi

Earlier this month, The Sun On Sunday published a report claiming Mr Zahawi had paid a seven-figure sum to settle a tax dispute over the sale of his YouGov shares.

The shares, worth an estimated £27m, were held by Balshore Investments, a company registered offshore in Gibraltar linked to Mr Zahawi's family.

Sky News understands that, as part of a settlement with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), Mr Zahawi paid a penalty to the tax collector.

Mr Sunak ordered an investigation by Sir Laurie Magnus, his independent adviser on ministers' interests, into whether Mr Zahawi broke ministerial rules over the estimated £4.8m bill he apparently settled with HMRC while he was chancellor.

Who is Nadhim Zahawi?

The PM told MPs that while it would have been ""politically expedient"" to sack Mr Zahawi, ""due process"" meant that the investigation into his tax affairs should be allowed to reach its conclusion.

Mr Zahawi said HMRC concluded there had been a ""careless and not deliberate"" error in the way the shares had been treated and has insisted he is ""confident"" and has ""acted properly throughout"".

However on Sunday, the PM sacked Mr Zahawi as Tory party chairman after the inquiry into the handling of his tax affairs found a ""serious breach"" of the ministerial code.

Mr Sunak accepted the fine. Fines of up to £500 can be issued for failing to wear a seatbelt when one is available.

In a statement, Number 10 said: ""The prime minister fully accepts this was a mistake and has apologised. He will of course comply with the fixed penalty.""

After being issued with the fixed penalty notice, Mr Sunak became the second serving prime minister - after Mr Johnson - to be found to have broken the law while in office.

Like Mr Johnson, he has previously been fined by the Met Police for breaking lockdown rules.

After the seatbelt fine, Labour said the prime minister has been turned into a ""laughing stock"".

Multiple U-turns

Within the first three months of his premiership, Mr Sunak has also been forced to carry out a series of U-turns to appease Conservative backbench MPs.

Mandatory housebuilding targets were ditched following pressure from the PM's own side.

Facing a rebel amendment from around 30 Tory MPs - including former PMs Boris Johnson and Liz Truss - Mr Sunak also U-turned over a ban on onshore wind by saying turbines could be installed if the projects gain the support of local communities.

Mr Sunak's line that he would not attend the COP27 climate summit in Egypt due to ""pressing domestic commitments"" was also reversed following outrage from environmental campaigners - with COP26 President Alok Sharma saying he was ""pretty disappointed"" by the prime minister's original decision, and the PM ultimately giving way to pressure to attend.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129103250/http://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-from-zahawi-and-raab-to-seatbelt-gaffe-the-u-turns-and-scandals-of-his-first-months-as-pm-12795816

Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson told Sky News' Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme the delay in sacking Nadhim Zahawi highlighted Rishi Sunak's ""weakness"".

She said: ""It's not clear to me what the prime minister has been waiting for. It's been as plain as day for weeks now that this was going to be the outcome.

""But because of Rishi Sunak's weakness, his weakness within his own party and his failure to put the country first as a result, it's taken a very long time to get here.

""It's just a shame it's taken him so long that our country continues to be sucked into this mire of sleaze that the Conservatives are delivering for us.

""When Rishi Sunak first became prime minister, he promised growth, integrity, accountability.

""I think we're a very, very long way away from that.""

She added: ""He didn't need the adviser to tell him this. It's just not clear to me why it's taken so long.

""But the sad truth is that Nadhim Zahawi is one of a number of cases that we've seen in recent months in the Conservative Party.

""So I also look forward to the prime minister taking action against Dominic Raab, and I also look forward to the prime minister taking action against Suella Braverman, who was herself found to have broken the ministerial code, but rather than sack her he invited her back into government.

""It is just a joke for the prime minister to suggest that somehow this is a government that has got accountability at his heart. They are riven with sleaze.

""They're just fighting it out constantly amongst themselves. And it's the British people who suffer as a result

""We face really big challenges right now, but when you've got this constant infighting and when you've got a prime minister that is so weak, he can't stand up for what's right, and he kind of outsources that judgement to others, I think it tells you everything you need to know about really why it is time for change in Britain.""

RowVaughn Wells said the officers accused of her son's murder had ""shamed their own families"" after Memphis Police released bodycam footage showing her son screaming ""mom, mom"" several times as he was attacked.

""Even though this tragedy happened to my son, I truly believe that there is going to be a greater good that comes out of this,"" Ms Wells told MSNBC.

""And that is what keeps me going to get this justice for my son, because I'm not going to stop until every person that had anything to do with my son's death is prosecuted to the fullest of the law.""

Ms Wells said the officers had ""shamed"" their communities, adding: ""You just brought a bad taste to everybody's mouth.

""I hate the fact that it was five black men that actually did this to another black man. My son probably was their age.

""They just brought disgrace to themselves. I'm not an evil person, my son is not an evil person.... I pray for (the officers') families, because their families didn't deserve any of this either.""

Ms Wells and Mr Nichols' stepfather called for people to protest in a non-violent way.

She described her son a ""beautiful person"" who was ""full of life"".

""He loved to skateboard, he loved to watch the sunsets. He was a great dad,"" she added.

""He was just a good person. There's no perfect person in this world, but he was close to it.""

Punched, kicked and tasered

Shocking video released by police - including bodycam and CCTV footage - showed Mr Nichols screaming for his mother while being beaten by officers.

The 29-year-old was attacked for three minutes while officers shouted profanities at him.

Mr Nichols was 80 yards from his family home when he was beaten, according to his mother.

In the footage of the attack, one camera shows the initial police stop at an intersection in Memphis, Tennessee.

""I'm going to baton the f*** out of you,"" one officer can be heard saying. His body camera shows him raise his baton while at least one other officer holds Mr Nichols.

After the first officer roughly pulls Mr Nichols out of his car just after 8:20pm on 7 January this year, the FedEx worker can be heard saying ""I didn't do anything"" as a group of officers begins to wrestle him to the ground.

""Get on the ground!,"" one officer yells, as another is heard shouting: ""Tase him! Tase him!""

The father-of-one calmly replied soon after being wrestled to the pavement: ""OK, I'm on the ground.""

Moments later, as the officers continue to shout, Mr Nichols says: ""Man, I am on the ground.""

An officer yells: ""Put your hands behind your back before I break your (expletive).""

The camera is briefly obscured and then Mr Nichols can be seen running as an officer fires a Taser at him. The officers then start chasing Mr Nichols.

He is then punched, kicked and hit with a baton. After the beating, officers mill about for several minutes while Mr Nichols lies propped up against the car, then slumps onto the street.

Emergency workers with what looks like medical equipment attend, but do not immediately intervene.

He died on 10 January, three days after the violent arrest.

Murder charges

Five officers have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes, including assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression over Mr Nichols' death.

They are Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr, Emmitt Martin III, Tadarrius Bean and Justin Smith.

A memorial fund set up in the aftermath of Mr Nichols has topped $535,000 (£433,000).

The child refugee turned multimillionaire politician sacked over his tax affairs;Sunday 29 January 2023 09:22, UK;[];['conservatives', 'nadhim zahawi'];['prime', 'refugee', 'mr', 'child', 'minister', 'paid', 'nadhim', 'later', 'tax', 'tory', 'sunak', 'politician', 'sacked', 'multimillionaire', 'zahawi', 'right', 'turned', 'affairs'];"He is a former child refugee who sold Teletubbies merchandise, founded the UK's best known polling company and was a contender to be leader of the Conservative Party.

But Nadhim Zahawi's rise through the echelons of Westminster has been brought to an abrupt halt after he was sacked as Tory chairman over his tax affairs.

So how did the 55-year-old rise to be the toast of the Tories before being told by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak he had committed a ""serious breach of the ministerial code"".

Follow reaction to Nadhim Zahawi's sacking - live updates

Early years

Mr Zahawi was born in Bagdad, Iraq, and spent his early years growing up as part of an influential Kurdish family.

His father was a well-known businessman and his grandfather was the governor of the Central Bank of Iraq.

But after Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979, the dictator began to target the Kurds.

""It was clear to my family Iraq would not be safe under his leadership and that is when we decided we had to flee to the UK,"" Mr Zahawi told his local newspaper, the Stratford Herald.

He arrived in the UK aged 11, unable to speak a word of English, and began his new life by going to Holland Park School in London.

Soon, his family moved him from a comprehensive education to private school, and he studied at both Ibstock Place School, Roehampton, and then King's College School, Wimbledon, both in southwest London.

However, as he was set to go off to university, an investment by his father went belly up and the family lost everything, except for their Vauxhall car.

Mr Zahawi used the vehicle to become a minicab driver to contribute to the family finances, but his mother insisted he carry on studying and pawned her jewellery to cover the costs.

So off he went to University College London to study chemical engineering.

Business endeavours

After graduating in 1988, it was the world of business he wanted to pursue and he sought to echo his father's example as an entrepreneur.

Like his father, it didn't always go right - his setting up of a firm that sold Teletubbies merchandise ended as a ""costly and painful mistake"", he later said.

But it did attract the attention and investment of Lord Jeffrey Archer - who once described him as a ""born organiser"" - and opened doors to the senior ranks of the Conservative Party.

Mr Zahawi became an aide to Lord Archer and in return, the peer helped with his own campaign to become a Tory councillor, winning a seat in the London borough of Wandsworth in 1994.

There was also a failed attempt to enter Parliament in 1997, when he competed for the new seat of Erith and Thamesmead amid a Labour landslide.

He helped with Lord Archer's London mayoral campaign in 1998 too, but it was brought to an early close when the peer pulled out of the race amid controversy.

It was the turn of the millennium that signalled another change in Mr Zahawi's fortunes when, alongside another former aide of Lord Archer's, Stephan Shakespeare, he founded polling company YouGov.

The business grew and grew, and within five years it was floated on the stock market valued at £18m.

He would later tell Sky News he was ""the beneficiary of the British dream"".

According to the Evening Standard, Mr Zahawi cashed in £1.2m of shares in 2005, and went on to work as the firm's CEO for a further five years.

But having made his fortune, he set his sights firmly back on the world of politics and, in 2010, he was elected as the MP for Stratford-upon-Avon.

Image: Mr Zahawi became an MP at the 2010 election.

Masters Of Nothing

A year later, with world still affected by the fallout from the 2008 recession, he co-authored a book with fellow MP Matt Hancock, titled Masters Of Nothing: How The Crash Will Happen Again Unless We Understand Human Nature.

He began to gain some recognition in the party, becoming part of the Number 10 policy unit advising the then prime minister David Cameron.

However, in this early part of his Commons career, he became more known to the public for his part in a 2013 expenses scandal, having claimed cash to power his horses' stables.

It wasn't until 2018 that Mr Zahawi was appointed into his first junior minister post - a parliamentary under secretary at the Department for Education - and a year later he was moved to the business department.

But he became a household name after COVID broke out in the UK and he was appointed by Boris Johnson to become the country's vaccine minister, receiving widespread praise for his work in the Department of Health and Social Care to tackle the pandemic.

Image: As vaccines minister, Mr Zahawi became a household name.

'Do the right thing and go'

The performance propelled him to cabinet and in September 2021, he took his first secretary of state post, back in the Department for Education.

The chaos that ensued the following year as Mr Johnson's downfall played out in public saw him pushed up the ranks again, replacing Rishi Sunak as chancellor in Number 11 after his dramatic resignation.

But two days later, Mr Zahawi joined the growing horde of ministers calling for the PM to step down, telling Mr Johnson: ""You must do the right thing and go now.""

A vacancy was created at the top, and he threw his hat in the ring to become the next Tory leader and next prime minister.

Giving his first broadcast campaign interview to Sky News, Mr Zahawi promised that under his control, the government would reduce corporation tax, income tax and national insurance.

But the issue of his own finances was brought to the fore after reports his tax affairs had been investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, the National Crime Agency and HMRC.

'I was clearly being smeared'

""I was clearly being smeared,"" he told Kay Burley. ""I'm not aware of this. I've always declared my taxes - I've paid my taxes in the UK. I will answer any questions HMRC has of me.

""But I will go further. I will make a commitment today, that if I am prime minister the right thing to do is publish my accounts annually. That is the right thing to do because we need to take this issue off the table.""

Mr Zahawi didn't make it through the first round of balloting, and instead threw his backing behind Liz Truss.

He carried on in the Treasury until Ms Truss took the keys to Number 10, but was dealt a demotion in her cabinet, instead becoming Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, minister for intergovernmental relations and minister for equalities.

As we know, this premiership was not to last long, and weeks later - under Rishi Sunak - Mr Zahawi was made chairman of the Tory Party.

A seven-figure sum

But those questions raised over the summer regarding his taxes were soon to resurface again.

In January 2023, The Sun On Sunday published a report claiming Mr Zahawi had paid a seven-figure sum to settle a dispute with HMRC over the sales of his YouGov shares.

Sky News made several attempts in the following days to get Mr Zahawi to confirm or deny the story, but his team refused, instead saying his tax affairs ""were and are fully up to date and are paid in the UK"".

Mr Sunak stood by him during Prime Minister's Questions that week, but by the weekend, the swirl of questions was growing by the hour.

'Careless not deliberate error'

Mr Zahawi released a statement saying he paid what HMRC said ""was due"" after it ""disagreed about the exact allocation"" of shares in YouGov.

The Tory chairman said this was a ""careless and not a deliberate error"" and didn't confirm if any penalty was also levied.

But Sky News understands that, as part of a settlement with HMRC, Mr Zahawi paid a penalty to the tax collector.

The exact size of the settlement has not been disclosed, but it is reported to be an estimated £4.8m including a 30% penalty.

Mr Sunak had ordered a potentially far-reaching investigation into Mr Zahawi to be conducted by the PM's new ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus.

But the prime minister initally resisted calls to sack Mr Zahawi, saying he retained ""confidence"" in his colleague.

But in a letter published on Sunday morning, Mr Sunak said an ethics inquiry into the handling of his tax affairs found a ""serious breach"" of the ministerial code.

He added: ""As a result, I have informed you of my decision to remove you from your position in His Majesty's government.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129103250/http://news.sky.com/story/who-is-nadhim-zahawi-the-child-refugee-turned-multimillionaire-politician-sacked-over-his-tax-affairs-12791994

Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham told Ridge the controversy over Nadhim Zahawi's tax affairs had taken ""much needed oxygen away"" from the issues that needed tackling, including the NHS crisis and the ""collapsing"" public transport system.

The Labour former cabinet minister said: ""The government really must learn lessons from this situation.

“This conclusion has felt inevitable, hasn’t it, for a long time and yet it has been allowed to dominate pretty much most of January when there is probably the worst crisis in the National Health Service that I can remember, and also we’ve got collapsing public transport around the country.

“People can’t get to work and attention should’ve been on those issues, absolutely those issues because they’re critical for millions of people.”

He added: “They must learn lessons from this and get government focus where it needs to be – on the very serious situation that there is out there for millions of people struggling with the cost of living crisis, ambulances queuing outside of hospitals, train timetables that are just non-existent in large parts of the country.

“Those are the things that the British public urgently need their government to focus on.”

He added: ""It takes much needed oxygen away from the issues that need to be that need to be debated.""

She was taken to hospital but died later that evening. The boy suffered ""serious, non-life-threatening injuries and remains in hospital"", Northumbria Police said.

Sir Laurie Magnus, who carried out the investigation as the prime minister's new ethics adviser, said the former chancellor ""should have understood"" from the outset that he was under investigation by HMRC and that it was a ""serious matter"".

He also criticised the MP for Stratford-on-Avon for failing to correct the record for more than six months, after he dismissed reports that HMRC was ""looking into"" his tax affairs as ""smears"" during a July 2022 interview with Sky News's Kay Burley.

Mr Zahawi was sacked as Tory party chairman on Sunday by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak following the publication of Sir Laurie's report, which looked into whether the former minister had fallen foul of the ministerial code.

Here Sky News looks at the key points in Sir Laurie's report:

'Mr Zahawi should have understood this was a serious matter'

""Mr Zahawi has told me that he had formed the impression that he and his advisers were merely being asked certain queries by HMRC concerning his tax affairs, and that this impression persisted until he received a letter from HMRC on 15 July 2022.

Image: Sir Laurie Magnus

""On the basis of the confidential information to which I have had access, including correspondence between HMRC and Mr Zahawi personally, I consider that an individual subject to the HMRC process faced by Mr Zahawi should have understood at the outset that they were under investigation by HMRC and that this was a serious matter.""

'Investigation was a relevant matter for a minister to declare'

""I consider that an HMRC investigation of the nature faced by Mr Zahawi would be a relevant matter for a Minister to discuss and declare as part of their declaration of interests.

""I would expect a Minister to inform their Permanent Secretary and to seek their advice on any implications for the management of their responsibilities.

Politics news - latest: Zahawi attacks media after sacking

""I would likewise expect a Minister proactively to update their declaration of interests form to include details of such an HMRC process.""

'Mr Zahawi's failure to declare investigation did not meet ministerial standards'

""After his appointment as Chancellor on 5 July 2022, Mr Zahawi completed a declaration of interests form which contained no reference to the HMRC investigation.

""A later form acknowledged (by way of an attachment) that Mr Zahawi was in discussion with HMRC to clarify a number of queries.

""Only following receipt of HMRC's letter received on 15 July 2022, did Mr Zahawi update his declaration of interests form to acknowledge that his tax affairs were under investigation, but he provided no further details other than the statement made previously that he was clarifying queries.

""Given the nature of the investigation by HMRC, which started prior to his appointment as Secretary of State for Education on 15 September 2021, I consider that by failing to declare HMRC's ongoing investigation before July 2022 - despite the ministerial declaration of interests form including specific prompts on tax affairs and HMRC investigations and disputes - Mr Zahawi failed to meet the requirement to declare any interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict.""

'Mr Zahawi failed to declare HMRC investigation ended in penalty'

""The subsequent fact that the investigation concluded with a penalty in relation to the tax affairs of a Minister also requires declaration and discussion.

""It is a relevant interest which could give rise to a conflict, and particularly so in the case of HM Treasury Ministers and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has responsibility for the UK tax system.

""It was not until mid-January 2023 that details of the earlier HMRC investigation and its outcome were declared.""

'Omissions constitute a serious failure to meet ministerial standards'

""I also conclude that, in the appointments process for the governments formed in September 2022 and October 2022, Mr Zahawi failed to disclose relevant information - in this case the nature of the investigation and its outcome in a penalty - at the time of his appointment, including to Cabinet Office officials who support that process.

""Without knowledge of that information, the Cabinet Office was not in a position to inform the appointing Prime Minister.

""Taken together, I consider that these omissions constitute a serious failure to meet the standards set out in the Ministerial Code.""

Nadhim Zahawi's interview with Sky News in July 2022

What Mr Zahawi said:

""There have been news stories over the last few days which are inaccurate, unfair and are clearly smears. It's very sad that such smears should be circulated and sadder still that they have been published.

""These smears have falsely claimed that the Serious Fraud Office, the National Crime Agency, and HMRC are looking into me. Let me be absolutely clear. I am not aware of this. I have not been told that this is the case.

""I've always declared my financial interests and paid my taxes in the UK. If there are questions, of course, I will answer any questions HMRC has of me.""

What Sir Laurie said about the statement:

""Mr Zahawi has told me that at the time of this statement, he was under the impression that he was answering HMRC's queries, but that he was not under investigation.

""I consider that an individual subject to the HMRC process faced by Mr Zahawi should have understood that they were under investigation by HMRC and that this was a serious matter.

""Under the Ministerial Code, Ministers have a duty to 'be as open as possible with Parliament and the public'.

""Whilst this duty clearly does not extend to disclosing personal tax information, it does include a general duty to be accurate in statements to ensure a false impression is not given or maintained.

""I remember visiting the site just a couple of days after the fire and thinking that it was horrific that this had happened.

""The more that I discovered about the circumstances the more horrified I was.

""There were people in that building who had warned beforehand that they were in potential danger. The warnings were not heeded.""

""I'm the first, I hope, to acknowledge that we haven't done right by the bereaved and the residents and survivors from Grenfell and that is one very, very important mission.

""But it's also the case that there been people who have been effectively imprisoned in their own flats for too long.""

A public inquiry after the tragedy, chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, is yet to deliver its final report.

But evidence submitted to the inquiry prompted Mr Gove to tell The Sunday Times: ""There was a system of regulation that was faulty.

""The government did not think hard enough, or police effectively enough, the whole system of building safety. Undoubtedly.""

On Monday Mr Gove will announce a six-week deadline for developers to sign a government contract to fix their unsafe towers - or be banned from the market.

He told Sky News that those who do not sign will face consequences.

""Well, we're going to publish it tomorrow and we are going to give every developer a little window of six weeks during which we hope they will sign,"" Mr Gove said.

""Some have already indicated that they will - and I don't want to pre-empt the speculation about some of the developers who will - but all the indications are that the overwhelming majority will and those who don't will face consequences if they don't sign the contract.

""We'll make sure that in effect they won't be able to build anything more in future.""

It is understood that Mr Gove will use the so-called ""responsible actor scheme"", to be established in the spring, to block such companies from getting planning or building control approval.

On Friday, Sky News learnt that major companies including Barratt Developments and Persimmon are preparing for the imminent signing of a legally-binding contract with the government that could ultimately cost the industry £5bn or more.

One executive said they expected the final contract to be signed and unveiled as soon as next week, although they cautioned that the timing remained fluid.

Last year, dozens of developers signed a pledge to fix buildings constructed since the early 1990s, with revisions to the deal with the government in recent weeks focusing on the scope of companies' exposure.

The Grenfell inquiry heard many of the companies involved in the tragedy have failed to accept blame for their role in the events prior to the disaster.

The inquiry also heard from Jason Beer KC, for the department of levelling up, housing and communities, who said the department ""apologises unreservedly"" for its failure to recognise weaknesses in the regulatory system.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129123251/http://news.sky.com/story/michael-gove-apologises-to-grenfell-victims-families-after-faulty-and-ambiguous-government-guidance-allowed-tragedy-to-occur-12798188

Nadhim Zahawi did commit ""a very serious breach of the ministerial code"" and the prime minister has sacked his party chairman.

Cue a collective sigh of relief from a parliamentary party irritated and angered that the tax affairs of a multi-millionaire cabinet minister had dominated the headlines for days.

Even before Sir Laurie Magnus concluded that Mr Zahawi had ""shown insufficient regard for the general principles of the ministerial code, under the requirements in particular…to be honest, open and an exemplary leader through his own behaviour"", MPs had decided there was only on course of events: that Mr Zahawi had to go.

Because the spectacle of a cabinet minister and former chancellor, who had £27m of wealth that he didn't initially pay tax on, when people are struggling to make ends meet, just doesn't pass the sniff test.

Zahawi fired as Tory party chairman - politics latest

But what emerged on Sunday makes the optics worse still: We know that Mr Zahawi did end up settling with the HMRC, reportedly paying a £5m sum (including a penalty).

But what we didn't know is how long the ""interaction"" with HMRC was going on undeclared, while Mr Zahawi was serving as a government cabinet minister and running for the Conservative party leadership.

Sir Laurie's investigation found this dispute had begun in April 2021 and was settled in August 2022.

There is stinging criticism from the PM's ethics advisor as to why Mr Zahawi didn't treat questions over his tax affairs back in April 2021 as a ""serious"" matter.

He did not disclose the HMRC investigation on his appointment as education secretary on 15 September 2021, or when he was appointed Boris Johnson's chancellor on 5 July 2022.

It was only on 15 July 2022 that the cabinet minister updated his declaration of interests acknowledging his tax affairs were under investigation after receiving a letter from HMRC.

There was also the matter of Mr Zahawi, during the Conservative leadership contest last July, dismissing reports about his tax affairs as ""inaccurate, unfair and clearly smears"".

Sir Laurie took a very dim view of Mr Zahawi failing to correct the record and disclose he had reached a settlement with HMRC until 21 January.

""I consider that this delay in correcting in an untrue public statement is inconsistent with the requirements of openness,"" he said.

For the government's critics, the whole sorry affair will be used to attack the ruling Conservatives as the party of sleaze.

His opponents will be able to argue that far from cleaning up government, the prime minister has inserted people into his top team at odds with those values, be that Gavin Williamson, forced to resign over bullying allegations, the sacked Mr Zahawi or deputy PM Dominic Raab, who is being investigated over eight bullying allegations.

Mr Sunak's allies argue that all the PM can do is stick to his word, make his government accountable and earn the public's trust in the way he handles what is thrown at him.

""This is why the PM wanted to have a proper process where the facts where established,"" one ally told me on Sunday.

""The timeline is now in the public domain for everyone to see. It provides Nadhim Zahawi with an opportunity to explain himself and it also determines what went on when.""

Cleaning up the mess of others, Mr Sunak will hope that what the public see is him doing the right thing.

But these things aren't so clear.

The PM might not have known about Mr Zahawi's tax affairs but what did he know, if anything, of accusations around bullying by Mr Williamson or Mr Raab before he put them into his cabinet?

Will the curse of the cabinet awayday spark doom for Sunak?

What the new Conservative administration can at least lay claim to is that Mr Sunak is taking a very different approach to that of Boris Johnson, who saw two independent ethics advisors quit his government in less than two years.

Lord Geidt dramatically quit in June 2022 after conceding the PM might have broken the ministerial code over partygate. His predecessor Alex Allen resigned in 2020 after Mr Johnson backed former home secretary Priti Patel, despite Mr Allen's report finding her to have breached the ministerial code for allegedly bullying civil servants.

Mr Sunak, in appointing an independent ethics advisor and then following his advice, is trying to demonstrate that the workings of Mr Johnson and his own are chalk and cheese.

The Serbian tennis star beat Greek player Stefanos Tsitsipas in three sets in the final in Melbourne on Sunday.

It is Djokovic's 10th Australian Open title and he has now equalled Nadal's Grand Slam record of 22 men's singles titles.

His victory comes a year after he was unable to compete in the tournament when he was deported from Australia because he refused to have the COVID vaccine.

After winning the match, Djokovic climbed into the stands to celebrate with his team and family and was overcome with emotion, lying on the ground and sobbing uncontrollably.

Speaking on court in a jacket bearing the number 22, he said: ""This has been one of the most challenging tournaments I've ever played in my life.

""Not playing last year, coming back this year. I want to thank all the people that made me feel welcome, made me feel comfortable to be in Melbourne, to be in Australia.

""There's a reason I've played my best tennis on this court. Only my team and my family know what we've been through in the last four, five weeks.

""This probably is the biggest victory in my life considering the circumstances.""

His 22 Grand Slam victories include seven Wimbledon titles, three US Open titles and two from the French Open. The first of his 10 Australian Open wins came back in 2008.

Tsitsipas congratulated his opponent on his record-equalling victory.

The 24-year-old said: ""I admire what you have done for the sport. You make me a better player when I am on the court.

""Novak brings the best out of me... he is the greatest that has ever held the tennis racket.""

""I have been continuously inspired by the courageous children, older people and viewers who have trusted me with their life stories. I have always tried to live up to that trust.

Flooding has inundated homes, caused road closures, and led to a train derailment.

Thousands of properties remain without power, while hundreds have no water supply, the authorities said.

Video posted online showed chest-deep water in some places.

Auckland emergency management controller Rachel Kelleher said: ""We know that there is potential for more adverse weather tonight.""

Deputy prime minister of New Zealand Carmel Sepuloni said: ""The most horrific part of it is that we've lost lives.""

Police said they found one man's body in a flooded culvert and another in a submerged car park.

They said fire and emergency crews found a third body after a landslide brought down a house in Remuera. a suburb of Auckland.

The Labour Party is this afternoon calling on Rishi Sunak to ""come clean"" about what he knew about the Nadhim Zahawi tax scandal.

Deputy leader Angela Rayner and Anneliese Dodds, the Labour Party chair, have written to the prime minister asking for ""full transparency"".

They said Mr Sunak should reveal what he knew about the investigation into Mr Zahawi's tax affairs - and when he found out.

Ms Rayner described Mr Sunak as ""hopelessly weak"", adding he was: ""Dragged kicking and screaming into doing what he should have done long ago.""

The MPs have posed a number of questions to Mr Sunak.

These include:

When he was made aware of the HMRC investigation into Mr Zahawi's tax affairs and if he knew the former Party Chair had agreed a multi-million pound settlement with the taxman;

Why he previously stated at PMQs that all questions on this issue had been answered;

What discussions he had with Mr Zahawi before appointing him to his cabinet;

When he will keep his promise to publish his own tax return for the 2022/23 tax year;

If any Conservative ministers had failed to submit their declaration of interests, and when the next register would be published.

Ms Dodds said: ""Nadhim Zahawi should have been sacked when this murky affair first surfaced. The fact that he has been able to spend weeks dodging questions shows just how weak Rishi Sunak is.

Sir Laurie Magnus, who carried out the investigation as the prime minister's new ethics adviser, said the former chancellor ""should have understood"" from the outset that he was under investigation by HMRC and that it was a ""serious matter"".

He added that Mr Zahawi should have declared his correspondence with HMRC as far back as September 2021 when he became education secretary.

He also criticised the MP for Stratford-on-Avon for failing to correct the record for more than six months, after he dismissed reports that HMRC was ""looking into"" his tax affairs as ""smears"" during a July 2022 interview with Sky News's Kay Burley.

Mr Zahawi was sacked as Tory party chairman on Sunday by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak following the publication of Sir Laurie's report, which looked into whether the former minister had fallen foul of the ministerial code.

Here Sky News looks at the key points in Sir Laurie's report:

'Mr Zahawi should have understood this was a serious matter'

""Mr Zahawi has told me that he had formed the impression that he and his advisers were merely being asked certain queries by HMRC concerning his tax affairs, and that this impression persisted until he received a letter from HMRC on 15 July 2022.

Image: Sir Laurie Magnus

""On the basis of the confidential information to which I have had access, including correspondence between HMRC and Mr Zahawi personally, I consider that an individual subject to the HMRC process faced by Mr Zahawi should have understood at the outset that they were under investigation by HMRC and that this was a serious matter.""

'Investigation was a relevant matter for a minister to declare'

""I consider that an HMRC investigation of the nature faced by Mr Zahawi would be a relevant matter for a Minister to discuss and declare as part of their declaration of interests.

""I would expect a Minister to inform their Permanent Secretary and to seek their advice on any implications for the management of their responsibilities.

Politics news - latest: Zahawi attacks media after sacking

""I would likewise expect a Minister proactively to update their declaration of interests form to include details of such an HMRC process.""

'Mr Zahawi's failure to declare investigation did not meet ministerial standards'

""After his appointment as Chancellor on 5 July 2022, Mr Zahawi completed a declaration of interests form which contained no reference to the HMRC investigation.

""A later form acknowledged (by way of an attachment) that Mr Zahawi was in discussion with HMRC to clarify a number of queries.

""Only following receipt of HMRC's letter received on 15 July 2022, did Mr Zahawi update his declaration of interests form to acknowledge that his tax affairs were under investigation, but he provided no further details other than the statement made previously that he was clarifying queries.

""Given the nature of the investigation by HMRC, which started prior to his appointment as Secretary of State for Education on 15 September 2021, I consider that by failing to declare HMRC's ongoing investigation before July 2022 - despite the ministerial declaration of interests form including specific prompts on tax affairs and HMRC investigations and disputes - Mr Zahawi failed to meet the requirement to declare any interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict.""

'Mr Zahawi failed to declare HMRC investigation ended in penalty'

""The subsequent fact that the investigation concluded with a penalty in relation to the tax affairs of a Minister also requires declaration and discussion.

""It is a relevant interest which could give rise to a conflict, and particularly so in the case of HM Treasury Ministers and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has responsibility for the UK tax system.

'Omissions constitute a serious failure to meet ministerial standards'

""I also conclude that, in the appointments process for the governments formed in September 2022 and October 2022, Mr Zahawi failed to disclose relevant information - in this case the nature of the investigation and its outcome in a penalty - at the time of his appointment, including to Cabinet Office officials who support that process.

What Mr Zahawi said:

""There have been news stories over the last few days which are inaccurate, unfair and are clearly smears. It's very sad that such smears should be circulated and sadder still that they have been published.

""These smears have falsely claimed that the Serious Fraud Office, the National Crime Agency, and HMRC are looking into me. Let me be absolutely clear. I am not aware of this. I have not been told that this is the case.

""I've always declared my financial interests and paid my taxes in the UK. If there are questions, of course, I will answer any questions HMRC has of me.""

What Sir Laurie said about the statement:

""Mr Zahawi has told me that at the time of this statement, he was under the impression that he was answering HMRC's queries, but that he was not under investigation.

""I consider that an individual subject to the HMRC process faced by Mr Zahawi should have understood that they were under investigation by HMRC and that this was a serious matter.

""Under the Ministerial Code, Ministers have a duty to 'be as open as possible with Parliament and the public'.

873;Girl, 15, who died after stabbing in Hexham is named - as boy charged with murder;Sunday 29 January 2023 13:58, UK;[];['northumberland'];['paid', 'support', 'stabbing', 'died', 'hexham', 'charged', 'named', 'school', 'tragedy', 'thoughts', 'town', 'murder', 'remain', '15', 'boy', 'shock', 'girl'];"A 15-year-old girl who died after a stabbing in Northumberland has been named by police.

Holly Newton died and a 16-year-old was injured following the incident in Hexham on Friday evening.

Another boy, aged 16, has been charged with murder, attempted murder and possession of an offensive weapon.

He will appear before magistrates in Newcastle on Monday.

Chief Superintendent Sam Rennison, of Northumbria Police, said: ""Holly still had so much left to look forward to in life, and this tragic incident has left her family devastated beyond words.

""Their grief simply cannot be put into words, and our thoughts are with both families involved and their loved ones as we continue to support them in every way we can.

""The investigation is ongoing, and I'd like to show my appreciation to the people of Hexham - and beyond - who have greatly assisted with our enquiries and shown their support.

""While our enquiries continue, we do believe all those involved are known to each other and there is no wider risk to the public.""

She added: ""Officers will remain in the area over the coming days, and we would encourage anyone with concerns to speak directly with them.""

Tributes paid to 'helpful and kind' girl

Holly was a pupil at Queen Elizabeth High School in Hexham which paid tribute to her.

""We are in shock after the terrible events of Friday evening and devastated at the loss of Holly, a truly lovely student who was quiet, conscientious, helpful and kind,"" the school said.

""Our thoughts are with Holly's family at this time of unbearable pain. We will come together as a school community on Monday to support each other as we grieve.""

Police were called to the Priestpopple area of Hexham shortly after 5.10pm on Friday.

Holly, from Haltwhistle in Northumberland, was taken to hospital but died later that evening. The injured boy suffered ""serious, non-life-threatening injuries and remains in hospital"", Northumbria Police said.

Forensics officers in white suits were seen in the town centre on Saturday and a cordon was expected to remain in place.

Hexham mayor Derek Kennedy yesterday said: ""It's an absolute tragedy, the town is in complete shock. To lose one of our children who attends a local high school is just horrendous.""

He said the town had a low crime rate and was last year named the happiest place to live in Britain.

""It's a very warm and loving community, so for a tragedy such as this to happen, we always find it much more difficult and it's knocked everyone for six,"" Mr Kennedy added.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129134739/http://news.sky.com/story/girl-15-who-died-after-stabbing-in-hexham-is-named-as-boy-charged-with-murder-12797811

877;'It saved my life': Rollout of overdose drug urged by campaigners;Sunday 29 January 2023 14:27, UK;['dan whitehead', '@danwnews'];['drugs'];['officers', 'rollout', 'naloxone', 'drugs', 'including', 'campaigners', 'saved', 'services', 'overdose', 'urged', 'medication', 'life', 'health', 'drug', 'social'];"A leading drugs charity is urging the government to speed up the rollout of a ""life-saving"" overdose medication.

The social care organisation Turning Point says access to naloxone must be expanded by allowing all public service workers to carry it to reduce drug-related deaths.

The drug can be administered via nasal spray or syringe to someone who has overdosed on opioids, including heroin, and restores normal breathing.

It is routinely carried by police officers in Scotland, but only trialled by forces in England.

It is more widely available through drug abuse hubs and health services.

A consultation of widening access to naloxone concluded in September 2021 and the Department of Health and Social Care is still considering its findings.

In Somerset, Trevor Watts has been clean of drugs for 10 years and now works as a peer mentor for Turning Point.

He has used naloxone himself, and the charity's hub in Taunton hands out the medication to those who may need it.

He said: ""It saved my life before and I know a lot of people who've died in the past from opioid overdose when it hasn't been available.

""The more of it that gets to the hands of the public - or the right people, the easier it's going to be, the more lives it's going to save.""

Image: Mentor Trevor Watts says naloxone saved his life when he took drugs

Turning Point medical director, Dr David Bremner, told Sky News the drug has the ability to save lives:

He said: ""Every opiate death is a preventable death.

""These are people who have died from a toxic amount of a substance that we can reverse.

""What we need to do is flood the market to get greater rates of carriage and use of naloxone... to ensure police, ambulance staff are carrying naloxone so that if they encounter an overdose they are able to reverse that.

""We've had great success with people carrying it in the community, the police, the ambulance services - but there are far more people that could be carrying naloxone and places that it could be stored.

""Ultimately, I want everyone who is prescribed an opiate to also be given naloxone to take home with them.""

Controversy over drug

The consultation found more than 90% agreed that prison officers, paramedics and others should be able to issue the medication without prescription.

But expanding who carries naloxone is controversial - with some bodies questioning whether such medication should be left to paramedics to administer.

Officers at Durham Constabulary have been able to carry naloxone for two years.

Chief Inspector Jason Meecham told Sky News there is no doubt it saves lives.

He said: ""It is unfamiliar territory for a lot of police forces, and that's totally understandable.

""It gives opportunities to officers who are first at the scene of a potential death to prevent that death from happening.

""It's a simple, safe, effective method of saving life.

""It's not a replacement for ambulance services, it's not a replacement for professional medical attention, it's something to hold onto while we're waiting for those professionals to arrive at the scene.""

The government says it will publish a full response to the consultation later this year.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Naloxone is already widely available from drug services without prescription, including many community pharmacies.

""Every year thousands of takeaway naloxone medication kits are provided to people at risk, their families and friends, and staff working with them in hostels and other locations.

""As part of our 10-year drugs strategy, this year we provided local authorities with an additional £2.2m for making naloxone more available, including through peer networks and the police, helping to save lives from drug overdose.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129143905/https://news.sky.com/story/it-saved-my-life-rollout-of-overdose-drug-urged-by-campaigners-12798101

Cue a collective sigh of relief from a parliamentary party irritated and angered that the tax affairs of a multi-millionaire cabinet minister had dominated the headlines for days.

Even before Sir Laurie Magnus concluded that Mr Zahawi had ""shown insufficient regard for the general principles of the ministerial code, under the requirements in particular…to be honest, open and an exemplary leader through his own behaviour"", MPs had decided there was only on course of events: that Mr Zahawi had to go.

Because the spectacle of a cabinet minister and former chancellor, who had £27m of wealth that he didn't initially pay tax on, when people are struggling to make ends meet, just doesn't pass the sniff test.

But what emerged on Sunday makes the optics worse still: We know that Mr Zahawi did end up settling with the HMRC, reportedly paying a £5m sum (including a penalty).

But what we didn't know is how long the ""interaction"" with HMRC was going on undeclared, while Mr Zahawi was serving as a government cabinet minister and running for the Conservative party leadership.

He did not disclose the HMRC investigation on his appointment as education secretary on 15 September 2021, or when he was appointed Boris Johnson's chancellor on 5 July 2022.

It was only on 15 July 2022 that the cabinet minister updated his declaration of interests acknowledging his tax affairs were under investigation after receiving a letter from HMRC.

His opponents will be able to argue that far from cleaning up government, the prime minister has inserted people into his top team at odds with those values, be that Gavin Williamson, forced to resign over bullying allegations, the sacked Mr Zahawi or deputy PM Dominic Raab, who is being investigated over eight bullying allegations.

What the new Conservative administration can at least lay claim to is that Mr Sunak is taking a very different approach to that of Boris Johnson, who saw two independent ethics advisors quit his government in less than two years.

Lord Geidt dramatically quit in June 2022 after conceding the PM might have broken the ministerial code over partygate. His predecessor Alex Allen resigned in 2020 after Mr Johnson backed former home secretary Priti Patel, despite Mr Allen's report finding her to have breached the ministerial code for allegedly bullying civil servants.

Mr Sunak, in appointing an independent ethics advisor and then following his advice, is trying to demonstrate that the workings of Mr Johnson and his own are chalk and cheese.

879;Nadhim Zahawi sacked: The seven major findings from ethics investigation;Sunday 29 January 2023 12:45, UK;[];[];['mr', 'ethics', 'seven', 'minister', 'nadhim', 'ministerial', 'investigation', 'tax', 'consider', 'major', 'sacked', 'zahawi', 'hmrc', 'declaration', 'findings', 'serious'];"Nadhim Zahawi's failure to disclose that he was in discussions with HMRC over his taxes was a ""serious failure to meet"" ministerial standards, a damning report into the affair has found.

Sir Laurie Magnus, who carried out the investigation as the prime minister's new ethics adviser, said the former chancellor ""should have understood"" from the outset that he was under investigation by HMRC and that it was a ""serious matter"".

He added that Mr Zahawi should have declared his correspondence with HMRC as far back as September 2021 when he became education secretary.

He also criticised the MP for Stratford-on-Avon for failing to correct the record for more than six months, after he dismissed reports that HMRC was ""looking into"" his tax affairs as ""smears"" during a July 2022 interview with Sky News's Kay Burley.

Mr Zahawi was sacked as Tory party chairman on Sunday by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak following the publication of Sir Laurie's report, which looked into whether the former minister had fallen foul of the ministerial code.

Here Sky News looks at the key points in Sir Laurie's report:

'Mr Zahawi should have understood this was a serious matter'

""Mr Zahawi has told me that he had formed the impression that he and his advisers were merely being asked certain queries by HMRC concerning his tax affairs, and that this impression persisted until he received a letter from HMRC on 15 July 2022.

Image: Sir Laurie Magnus

""On the basis of the confidential information to which I have had access, including correspondence between HMRC and Mr Zahawi personally, I consider that an individual subject to the HMRC process faced by Mr Zahawi should have understood at the outset that they were under investigation by HMRC and that this was a serious matter.""

'Investigation was a relevant matter for a minister to declare'

""I consider that an HMRC investigation of the nature faced by Mr Zahawi would be a relevant matter for a Minister to discuss and declare as part of their declaration of interests.

""I would expect a Minister to inform their Permanent Secretary and to seek their advice on any implications for the management of their responsibilities.

Politics news - latest: Zahawi attacks media after sacking

""I would likewise expect a Minister proactively to update their declaration of interests form to include details of such an HMRC process.""

'Mr Zahawi's failure to declare investigation did not meet ministerial standards'

""After his appointment as Chancellor on 5 July 2022, Mr Zahawi completed a declaration of interests form which contained no reference to the HMRC investigation.

""A later form acknowledged (by way of an attachment) that Mr Zahawi was in discussion with HMRC to clarify a number of queries.

""Only following receipt of HMRC's letter received on 15 July 2022, did Mr Zahawi update his declaration of interests form to acknowledge that his tax affairs were under investigation, but he provided no further details other than the statement made previously that he was clarifying queries.

""Given the nature of the investigation by HMRC, which started prior to his appointment as Secretary of State for Education on 15 September 2021, I consider that by failing to declare HMRC's ongoing investigation before July 2022 - despite the ministerial declaration of interests form including specific prompts on tax affairs and HMRC investigations and disputes - Mr Zahawi failed to meet the requirement to declare any interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict.""

'Mr Zahawi failed to declare HMRC investigation ended in penalty'

""The subsequent fact that the investigation concluded with a penalty in relation to the tax affairs of a Minister also requires declaration and discussion.

""It is a relevant interest which could give rise to a conflict, and particularly so in the case of HM Treasury Ministers and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has responsibility for the UK tax system.

""It was not until mid-January 2023 that details of the earlier HMRC investigation and its outcome were declared.""

'Omissions constitute a serious failure to meet ministerial standards'

""I also conclude that, in the appointments process for the governments formed in September 2022 and October 2022, Mr Zahawi failed to disclose relevant information - in this case the nature of the investigation and its outcome in a penalty - at the time of his appointment, including to Cabinet Office officials who support that process.

""Without knowledge of that information, the Cabinet Office was not in a position to inform the appointing Prime Minister.

""Taken together, I consider that these omissions constitute a serious failure to meet the standards set out in the Ministerial Code.""

Nadhim Zahawi's interview with Sky News in July 2022

What Mr Zahawi said:

""There have been news stories over the last few days which are inaccurate, unfair and are clearly smears. It's very sad that such smears should be circulated and sadder still that they have been published.

""These smears have falsely claimed that the Serious Fraud Office, the National Crime Agency, and HMRC are looking into me. Let me be absolutely clear. I am not aware of this. I have not been told that this is the case.

""I've always declared my financial interests and paid my taxes in the UK. If there are questions, of course, I will answer any questions HMRC has of me.""

What Sir Laurie said about the statement:

""Mr Zahawi has told me that at the time of this statement, he was under the impression that he was answering HMRC's queries, but that he was not under investigation.

""I consider that an individual subject to the HMRC process faced by Mr Zahawi should have understood that they were under investigation by HMRC and that this was a serious matter.

""Under the Ministerial Code, Ministers have a duty to 'be as open as possible with Parliament and the public'.

""Whilst this duty clearly does not extend to disclosing personal tax information, it does include a general duty to be accurate in statements to ensure a false impression is not given or maintained.

""I consider that this delay in correcting an untrue public statement is inconsistent with the requirement for openness.""

'Insufficient regard for Ministerial Code'

At the start of the year, we set up an email address for people to write in with their stories from the front line of the NHS.

Hundreds of people responded. But many of them said the same thing.

""The staff can see the problems in the NHS and some of them are such easy wins yet the moment anyone suggests anything or heaven forbid raises a complaint then their career is finished. So we all keep quiet,"" wrote one paramedic.

""Please keep me anonymous as I'm scared of repercussions - nurses are always under fear of speaking out,"" said a nurse in the North West of England.

Other organisations paint a similar picture.

Protect, a whisteblowing charity, analysed calls to their helpline in the last year and told us that of 92 NHS workers who made contact, 77% reported retaliation or detrimental treatment as a result of speaking up.

A third (33%) said they were either dismissed or felt they had to resign after raising concerns.

The culture of silence within the NHS has long been recognised as a problem.

In 2014, the government commissioned Robert Francis KC to write an independent report on ways to tackle it.

His 2015 review Freedom to Speak Up recommended the creation of a network of - Freedom to Speak Up Guardians - across the NHS, to encourage a culture of openness and reporting.

Dr Jayne Chidgey-Clark, the National Guardian for NHS England, told us: ""I think at the moment, there's lots of good work being done in some organisations to improve the speak up culture.

""But sadly, in some, there is still an absolute fear of repercussions. It's a real issue that we have to get right in the NHS.""

Patients share their negative and positive experiences

NHS staff survey data shows that staff confidence in the ability to raise concerns is actually falling.

Last year's survey suggested just 62% of NHS staff felt safe to speak up about their concerns, down from 65% in 2020, when the question was first asked.

In 2013, when a slightly different but similar question was asked, the number was 72%.

'It's a version of 1984'

Speaking to us on condition of anonymity, one paramedic described the culture as Orwellian.

""It used to be we could say what we wanted in our crew room. That was a safe space. You can't even speak up in there now because somebody will report it,"" they said.

""You'll get called to an office and say, 'Did you say that? Did you mean that?' So, no, there isn't freedom to speak.

NHS England said in a statement: ""The NHS is committed to creating a positive work environment and it is completely unacceptable for any member of staff to feel silenced or unable to speak about issues that are affecting them.

882;Scotland pauses movement of all transgender prisoners while rules reviewed;Sunday 29 January 2023 16:39, UK;[];['scotland', 'transgender'];['trans', 'women', 'reviewed', 'risk', 'pauses', 'prison', 'transgender', 'rules', 'spokesperson', 'violence', 'prisoners', 'woman', 'scotland', 'safety', 'review', 'movement'];"Scotland has paused the movement of any transgender prisoner while it carries out an ""urgent"" review of the rules.

It comes after prison chiefs in Scotland have in recent weeks approved moving Tiffany Scott, who stalked a 13-year-old girl while known as Andrew Burns, to an all-female prison.

In another case, Nicola Sturgeon last week said that Isla Bryson, a transgender woman convicted of rape carried out while she was a man, will not be imprisoned in the all-female Cornton Vale prison in Scotland.

A Scottish Prison Service spokesperson said: ""We have commenced an urgent review of all transgender cases currently managed in our establishments.

""Our first concern is always, and remains, the health, safety, and wellbeing of all the people in our care, and that of our staff.

""We have very robust risk assessment processes, and a track record of keeping people safe, in often challenging circumstances.

""We have therefore paused the movement of all transgender individuals, until the review has been completed.""

The spokesperson said the review will consider ""any history of violence or sexual offending against women, and associated risk, with a view to determining the most appropriate location for the individual to be accommodated"".

""Until the review is completed, any trans individuals, with a history of violence towards women, will only be admitted to the male estate, in segregation, when they first enter our care,"" the spokesperson added.

Scotland's Justice Secretary Keith Brown said: ""I understand that the issue of any trans woman being convicted of violent and sexual offences is a highly emotive subject and that the public concern is understandable.

""As the First Minister pointed out last week, we must not allow any suggestion to take root that trans women pose an inherent threat to women. Predatory men are the risk to women.

""However, as with any group in society, a small number of trans women will offend and be sent to prison.

""Therefore, I hope that the measures I am about to highlight will offer reassurance in the ongoing ability of the prison service to manage trans individuals and ensure the safety of all prisoners.

""We must also never forget that there are victims in these cases. My thoughts remain with them.""

Mr Brown insisted the Scottish Prison Service's current rules ""have in no way been changed or impacted by the recent passing of the Gender Recognition Reform Bill"", which he said ""in any event, is not yet in force"".

""The on-going safety of prisoners - many of whom have experienced gender-based violence in the community - will remain the priority in all actions that are taken,"" he added.

""Beyond the steps being set out today, it is vital that decisions about the location and management of prisoners continue to be based on thorough risk assessment, drawing on the expertise and input of relevant professionals and applying any lessons learned from the reviews referred to.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129171700/http://news.sky.com/story/scotland-pauses-movement-of-all-transgender-prisoners-while-it-reviews-rules-12798620

Lady Susan, who is Prince William's godmother and was the late Queen's lady in waiting for more than 60 years, looked in good spirits as she arrived at St Mary Magdalene Church.

She stepped down from her role after asking Ngozi Fulani, a black woman who campaigns against domestic violence, where she ""really came from"" at a Buckingham Palace reception in November.

Lady Susan, 83, apologised after she repeatedly asked Ms Fulani, chief executive of the charity Sistah Space, about her heritage - according to a transcript provided by Ms Fulani, who described the exchange as a ""violation"".

In comments to The Independent website at the time, Ms Fulani said: ""This is bigger than one individual. It's institutional racism ... this incident is unfortunate and shows that nothing has changed.""

It happened at a reception held by the Queen Consort to examine violence against women and girls.

A spokesperson for the Prince of Wales described the incident as ""really disappointing"".

They added: ""Obviously, I wasn't there, but racism has no place in our society. The comments were unacceptable, and it is right that the individual has stepped aside with immediate effect.""

""Lady Susan offered her sincere apologies for the comments that were made and the distress they caused to Ms Fulani,"" it added in a statement.

Sands, 65, went missing in the Baldy Bowl area of the San Gabriel mountains in southern California on 13 January.

Efforts to find him have been hampered by bad weather, the authorities have said. Helicopters were grounded on Thursday because of strong winds.

Fellow actor Kevin Ryan said Sands had embarked on a ""tricky, dangerous hike"" but is the ""most advanced hiker I know"".

However, he added that each day brings ""more pressure"" and ""a lot of doubt"".

Ryan, who has climbed Mount Baldy a number of times, met Sands on the set of 2014 US drama series Crossbones.

They became friends and started walking together.

""Julian is such an advanced hiker,"" Ryan, 38, said. ""It's what he did. His whole life he was climbing mountains. It was a true passion of his.

""He is beyond experienced and I'm hoping that he's tucked away somewhere and can pull through.""

Ryan warned, however, that Mount Baldy is a ""different mountain"" in the winter, ""especially with how heavy weather has hit that area - that's a whole new trail"".

He added: ""But that is something that Julian would have seen as a challenge, to go up in those conditions. He likes to push himself and he's done that.

""And, like anything, that makes you better, to push yourself in life. But in this situation, it's a very tricky, dangerous hike with these weather conditions.

""And obviously something has gone wrong. Hopefully with time we'll find out and hopefully it'll be the best result.""

Ryan added: ""The only reason I'm not out there joining the search party is because I'm filming right now in Ireland, otherwise I would be out there to give my support.""

Sands was born in Yorkshire and moved to Los Angeles in 2020.

His breakout role came as the free-spirited George in the period drama A Room With A View, in which he starred opposite Helena Bonham Carter.

More recently, in 2021 he played a chief medical officer in Jack Lowden and starred in the drama Benediction with Peter Capaldi.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129183228/http://news.sky.com/story/julian-sands-something-has-gone-wrong-says-friend-of-missing-british-actor-12798647

Police have said their father, a 54-year-old Austrian, is a member of the far-right Reichsburger movement and is a known Holocaust denier.

Social services were called to the property in Obritz, near the Czech border, when locals became concerned for the children's welfare.

But when they tried to get in, the father attacked them with pepper spray.

Police were called and the man was arrested. He has since been released on bail as an investigation is carried out.

The children - aged between seven months and five years - were taken with their mother to be checked out in hospital.

Police spokesman Stefan Loidl said they were ""in a good health condition and were not neglected"".

The children are currently being looked after by social services.

Local authorities said they believed the family were living in the illegal hideout for several months but there had been complaints about them over the last few weeks.

Erich Greil, Orbritz deputy mayor, said: ""The surveillance cameras in front of the cellar were particularly annoying and residents sometimes heard children's voices in the basement and as soon as they approached it was quiet.""

Police said there was no suggestion of any sexual abuse of the children found in the cellar.

Mr Loidl added that a ""long gun, two crossbows and several compressed air weapons"", were found in the cellar.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129191742/http://news.sky.com/story/six-british-children-discovered-in-abandoned-wine-cellar-in-austria-12798716

Lee Anderson, the Ashfield MP, made the comment in a heated debate between colleagues about whether the party was doing enough to tackle the issue of small boats crossing the Channel.

Mr Anderson also suggested that any officials blocking the plan could be viewed as having committed ""treason"".

The exchange shows the depth of dislike of officials amongst some Tory MPs, and a mistrust that Rishi Sunak's administration is going far enough on key issues.

The online discussion took place on Sunday morning, and saw Mr Anderson tell the Common Sense Group of MPs on WhatsApp, which has over 60 members, that the prime minister's flagship legislation ""will not stop the crossings"".

He added that: ""I learnt that in Calais last week. We are blundering into a crisis that is growing out of control.""

He went on to say that the only way of dealing with the issue was the plan initially put forward by Boris Johnson to send asylum seekers to Rwanda.

""We could start these flights today if we had the balls,"" he added.

When one colleague said that ""legislation is coming"" - referring to further legislation to detail and remove people from entering the UK illegally - the Tory MP for Dudley North Marco Longhi said: ""I don't want to shoot the messenger.

""But we've had legislation before. ECHR (the European Convention on Human Rights, which could hold up flights) trumps everything and our own colleagues want to keep it even if it poses a security risk to UK people as we've just seen.

Mr Anderson replied: ""It's like the band on the Titanic. Playing the same tune and ignoring the obvious.""

The discussion then turned to the civil service.

It comes after a Sunday Express front page, sent around the group, which claimed that Mr Sunak was ""at war over a plot to tear up rules and ban illegal migrants from claiming UK asylum"", adding: ""Rishi Sunak is on a collision course with civil servants over plans to ban illegal migrants from claiming asylum.""

Ipswich MP Tom Hunt said to the group: ""All of the unelected civil servants who are attempting to block the democratically elected government should either be fired or named.

""If they want to engage in politics and be a political actor they should either leave their profession and stand for office or get the scrutiny that comes with it.""

The post received an ""applause emoji"" denoting the support from an unknown colleague.

Mr Anderson replied: ""Going against the state is Treason. Surely.""

Mr Longhi said: ""Ha. But they see themselves as the state.""

In a sign of the dislike of civil servants amongst some Tory MPs, earlier in the discussion Mid Derbyshire MP Pauline Latham said: ""I thought civil servants advise and ministers decide?

""Obviously no longer!""

Wrexham MP Sarah Atherton said: ""I thought there was a process to sack them. Obviously no longer! They counter-argue with bullying claims.""

John Hayes, the veteran MP close to home secretary Suella Braverman, wrote: ""They simply must be told! Please feed into your whips that this is the government's most urgent priority.

""We must back Suella in this battle with out of touch, privileged, unelected pen pushers.""

892;Virtual hospital wards no substitute for real people, says patient waiting for hip operation;Sunday 29 January 2023 20:30, UK;[];['nhs'];['real', 'parkinsons', 'week', 'hip', 'wards', 'wants', 'waiting', 'hospital', 'social', 'carlo', 'substitute', 'care', 'virtual', 'patient', 'operation', 'crisis', 'nhs'];"Carlo Zamboni used to climb in the Scottish Highlands in the school holidays.

Today, crossing his small flat is a mission for the retired teacher. Nudging 70, he's on the NHS waiting list for a hip operation and a diagnosis to confirm the Parkinson's disease his hand tremors suggest.

We were speaking to him as the NHS said it was planning to free up space by treating up to 50,000 elderly and vulnerable patients in ""virtual wards"" at home.

Three months ago a fall put Carlo in hospital.

""I fell over in a graveyard, lost my balance for some reason,"" he said. ""I was suspected of possibly developing Parkinson's disease nine months previously, so I was taken to hospital.""

After a week he was discharged into the reality of Britain's overwhelmed health and care system; a care trap for those, like Carlo, not sick enough to be in hospital, but not quite poor enough to qualify for social care.

""I thought I wasn't satisfactorily cured or knew what was wrong with me, because they couldn't diagnose or do the test for Parkinson's,"" he said.

""You could feel the pressure to get people out of the hospital. I totally understand the crisis but it's a crisis we could have planned for. And we didn't plan for it.""

Carlo is not alone. His brother pops in to help, he's had support from charities and the local church food bank, and a district nurse visits once a week to check a catheter, the legacy of a collapsed bowel.

He does not qualify for social care support, however. Modest savings and a potential inheritance put him above the earnings threshold.

The local council has installed wall rails and a rope bannister at the top of the stairs to his flat, but the 400 yard walk to the chemist still takes an hour and leaves him exhausted.

How to deal with the needs of people like Carlo, living with multiple morbidities, is one of the fundamental challenges facing the health service in a crisis like no other.

One reason emergency services are overwhelmed is because a fifth of beds are occupied by people who could be at home if only they could be discharged safely. This winter has seen huge pressure to speed up that process.

With social care denuded by low pay and a staffing shortage, NHS England wants to scale up the use of technology, prescribing wearable devices to vulnerable people so they can be monitored remotely from home rather than a precious hospital bed.

Carlo says the ""hospital at home"" plan might help. ""It's a possibility worth exploring and experimenting with, but there's no replacement for real people,"" he told us.

What he really wants, though, is the government to honour the NHS commitment.

""I expect the NHS to remain true to its principles and I expect people to have faith in the NHS.

They said this decline in war-fighting capability - following decades of cuts to save money - needed to be reversed faster than planned in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine.

""Bottom line... it's an entire service unable to protect the UK and our allies for a decade,"" one of the defence sources said.

Image: Ben Wallace was given a frank assessment of the army by a US general, say sources

The sources said Rishi Sunak risked failing in his role as ""wartime prime minister"" unless he took urgent action given the growing security threat posed by Vladimir Putin's Russia.

This should include increasing the defence budget by at least £3bn a year; halting a plan to shrink the size of the army even further; and easing peacetime procurement rules that obstruct the UK's ability to buy weapons and ammunition at speed.

""We have a wartime prime minister and a wartime chancellor,"" one source said.

""History will look back at the choices they make in the coming weeks as fundamental to whether this government genuinely believes that its primary duty is the defence of the realm or whether that is just a slogan to be given lip service.""

Offering a sense of the scale of the challenge faced by the army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, it is understood that:

The armed forces would run out of ammunition ""in a few days"" if called upon to fight

The UK lacks the ability to defend its skies against the level of missile and drone strikes that Ukraine is enduring

It would take five to ten years for the army to be able to field a war-fighting division of some 25,000 to 30,000 troops backed by tanks, artillery and helicopters

Some 30% of UK forces on high readiness are reservists who are unable to mobilise within NATO timelines - ""so we'd turn up under strength""

The majority of the army's fleet of armoured vehicles, including tanks, was built between 30 to 60 years ago and full replacements are not due for years

European powers like France and Germany have announced plans to boost defence spending significantly following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.

Putin 'at war with the West'

The European Union has even said President Putin is now at war with the West and NATO.

But the UK's chancellor-turned-prime minister just wants the problem ""to go away"", a second source claimed.

Mr Sunak has yet to make any meaningful pledge to expand his defence coffers, instead pursuing a ""refresh"" of a review of defence policy that is due to be published on 7 March ahead of a spring budget that will signal whether there is any new money for the military.

Image: Rishi Sunak has yet to make any meaningful pledge to increase defence cash

While the picture is bleak across the military, the army is in a particularly bad place.

Plans exist to modernise the service with fighting vehicles, missiles and upgraded tanks but they were devised before Russia launched its war and the timeline to deliver the transformation is too slow to meet the heightened risk, according to the defence sources.

Such concerns are not just being expressed by individuals inside UK defence circles, with sources saying a high-ranking US general offered a frank assessment of the British Army to Mr Wallace and some other senior officials last autumn.

The general used a term to rank the strength of a country's military, with tier one regarded as a top-level power such as the United States, Russia, China and France and a status the UK also seeks to hold.

Tier two would describe a more middling power with less fighting capability such as Germany or Italy.

According to the sources, the general, referring to the army, said: ""You haven't got a tier one. It's barely tier two.""

One of the sources insisted that the US and the rest of NATO understands the UK is planning to rebuild its force.

""It's now in a better cycle with a lot of new investment over the next ten years"", the source said.

""As long as they don't screw up the procurement, they're on track to be a modern army.""

But other sources were less confident about how the UK was being viewed by its allies.

Image: A degradation in fighting-power has long been a concern

Defence crisis a long time coming

The crisis in defence has been a generation in the making following repeated reductions in the size of the three armed services since the end of the Cold War by successive Conservative, coalition and Labour governments to save money for peacetime priorities.

Compounding the impact of the cuts is a chronic failure by the Ministry of Defence and the army over the past 20 years to procure some of its most needed equipment - such as armoured vehicles and new communication systems - despite spending billions of pounds.

In addition, the need to supply Ukraine with much of the army's remaining stocks of weapons and ammunition to help the Ukrainian military fight Russia has increased the pressure even further.

The UK is playing a key role in supporting Kyiv, with the prime minister becoming the first leader to promise to send western tanks - a leadership role he appeared keen to highlight when he took to social media after Germany and the US followed suit.

""Really pleased they've joined the UK in sending main battle tanks to Ukraine,"" Mr Sunak tweeted last Wednesday.

""We have a window to accelerate efforts to secure a lasting peace for Ukrainians. Let's keep it up.""

Yet despite this tough talk, Mr Sunak failed to list fixing capability gaps in his own armed forces as being among his top five priorities in his first policy speech as prime minister in early January even as Russia's war rages on in Europe.

""The PM's wartime approach is currently to cut the army, hollow it out further by gifting [equipment to Ukraine] and with no plans to replace [the weapons] for five to seven years,"" the first defence source said.

In 2020, Boris Johnson, as prime minister, increased defence spending by £16 billion - the biggest uplift since the Cold War, but not enough to plug the gaps.

Since then, rising inflation, foreign exchange rates and the need to accelerate modernisation plans in the wake of Ukraine will mean more cuts without new cash, the sources said.

'Hollow force'

The chronic erosion has created what defence sources describe as a ""hollow force"", with insufficient personnel, not enough money to train and arm those still on the books, out-dated weapons and depleted stockpiles of ammunition and spare parts.

It has long been a concern, but Mr Putin's invasion of Ukraine has created an added sense of urgency - though seemingly not yet inside Number 10, according to General Sir Richard Barrons, a former senior commander.

""The money needed to fix defence is small when compared to other areas of spending like health, welfare and debt interest. So this is a matter of government choices, not affordability,"" he told Sky News.

""Defence can no longer be left at the bottom of the list... Why is this lost on Downing Street and the Treasury, but not in Paris or Berlin?""

Mr Sunak has so far resisted calls to follow his predecessor, Liz Truss, to lift defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030 up from just over 2% at present.

NATO requires all allies to spend at least 2% of national income on defence - a minimum baseline that France and Germany have previously failed to meet but have pledged to achieve.

Army smallest since Napoleonic times

At just 76,000 strong, the British army is less than half the size it was back in 1990 and the smallest it has been since Napoleonic times.

The force is due to shrink even further to 73,000 under current plans that will be implemented unless new money is found.

Retired generals, admirals and air chief marshals have been sounding the alarm for years, finding their voices typically after choosing to stay quiet while in uniform.

But unusually, even serving officials have started to speak more bluntly in public about their depleted capabilities - a clear signal of serious concern within the Ministry of Defence's main building and at the headquarters of the three services as well as strategic command.

'Known capability risks'

Appearing before a committee of MPs earlier this month, Lieutenant General Sharon Nesmith, deputy chief of the general staff, spoke about the army's plans to modernise, which were set out in 2021 as part of a body of work that was done in line with the government's integrated review.

It envisaged delivering a war-fighting division, supported by new armoured vehicles and long-range missiles to be created by 2030 - leaving an interim gap.

""There were known capability risks,"" Lt Gen Nesmith said in her evidence to MPs on the defence select committee.

""I think that, through today's lens of war in Ukraine, on land, some of those decisions feel very uncomfortable.""

A government spokesperson said: ""The prime minister is clear that we have to do everything necessary to protect our people, which is why the UK has the largest defence budget in Europe and we made the biggest investment in the UK defence industry since the Cold War in 2020.

""We are ensuring our armed forces have the equipment and capability they need to meet the threats of tomorrow, including through a fully-funded £242bn 10-year equipment plan.""

Regrowing military capability - something most European nations are also having to do - is difficult, particularly because of the need to balance support to the UK's own defence industry and jobs against securing bulk purchases at a competitive price.

A separate defence source said: ""The defence secretary has made clear for years now, about the need to modernise our army to ensure it keeps pace with our allies.

""That's why at the spending review in 2020 he achieved an extra £16bn… Reinvesting, learning lessons from Ukraine and growing industrial skills takes time.

""We are on track to start to see new tanks, personnel carriers and air defence systems by the year after next. Over the next few years, Britain will rightly regain its place as one of the leading land forces in Europe.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230129220552/http://news.sky.com/story/us-general-warns-british-army-no-longer-top-level-fighting-force-defence-sources-reveal-12798365

An ethics inquiry into the handling of Mr Zahawi's finances found a ""serious breach"" of the ministerial code and Mr Sunak swiftly removed the Tory chairman from his position.

But the PM remains under pressure to outline what he knew about the investigation into Mr Zahawi's tax affairs and when.

'Charismatic' Johnson suggested as Zahawi replacement - politics latest

Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner and chairwoman Anneliese Dodds have written to Mr Sunak asking him to give the public ""full transparency"".

The letter includes a range of questions for the prime minister to answer:

• When he was made aware of the HMRC investigation into Zahawi's tax affairs and if he knew the former Party Chair had agreed a multi-million pound settlement with the taxman

• Why he previously stated at PMQs that all questions on this issue had been answered

• What discussions he had with Zahawi before appointing him to his cabinet

• When he will keep his promise to publish his own tax return for the 2022/23 tax year

• If any Conservative ministers had failed to submit their declaration of interests, and when the next register would be published.

Ms Dodds described Mr Sunak as ""weak"" for not sacking Mr Zahawi ""when this murky affair first surfaced"".

""Rishi Sunak has eventually relented to pressure and sacked Nadhim Zahawi,"" she said.

""This doesn't change the fact that his government is drowning in sleaze, with whole rogues' gallery of ministers being investigated for security breaches, bullying allegations and murky tax affairs.

""We need to know precisely what Rishi Sunak knew about Zahawi's tax affairs and the HMRC investigation, why he was appointed to the cabinet in the first place, and when the prime minister will be transparent about his own tax return.""

Ms Rayner added: ""This hopelessly weak prime minister has been dragged kicking and screaming into doing what he should have done long ago.

""Rishi Sunak shouldn't have needed an ethics adviser to tell him that Nadhim Zahawi's position was untenable, but instead he continued to prop up the man he appointed to cabinet.

""He must now come clean on the advice he was given about that appointment in the first place and why he apparently ignored the warnings.""

Mr Sunak had resisted earlier calls from opposition parties to sack Mr Zahawi as Tory party chairman following reports that he had paid a penalty as part of an estimated £4.8m settlement dispute with HMRC.

He had instead asked his new ethics adviser - Sir Laurie Magnus - to assess whether the settlement amounted to a breach of the ministerial code.

In a letter written by Sir Laurie to the PM on Sunday morning following the conclusion of the investigation, the ethics adviser said Mr Zahawi had ""shown insufficient regard for the general principles of the ministerial code"" and had not fulfilled the requirements of being an ""honest, open and an exemplary leader"".

In the correspondence to Mr Sunak released by Downing Street, Sir Laurie said his overall judgement was that the ""omissions"" by Mr Zahawi regarding his tax affairs ""constitute a serious failure to meet the standards set out in the ministerial code"".

In a second letter written by the PM to Mr Zahawi following Sir Laurie's findings, Mr Sunak said it is ""clear that there has been a serious breach of the ministerial code"" and announced the removal of the Tory chairman from his ministerial position.

Informing Mr Zahawi of his decision to remove him from government, Mr Sunak wrote: ""Following the completion of the independent adviser's investigation - the findings of which he has shared with us both - it is clear that there has been a serious breach of the Ministerial Code.

""As a result, I have informed you of my decision to remove you from your position in His Majesty's Government.""

Mr Zahawi had insisted he was ""confident"" he had ""acted properly throughout"".

In a statement on Sunday morning, the Lib Dems said Mr Zahawi should also step down from his role as an MP as he is ""unfit to serve the people of Stratford-upon-Avon"".

But in a letter to Mr Sunak following his sacking - in which he made no apology for his actions - Mr Zahawi told the PM he can be ""assured of my support from the backbenches in the coming years"".

Rishi Sunak has described the proposals, which ministers hope will boost under-strain emergency care in the NHS, as ""ambitious and credible"".

Revealing the two-year plan, the NHS and government said 800 new ambulances, including 100 specialist mental health vehicles, and 5,000 more sustainable hospital beds would be backed by a dedicated £1bn fund.

The money for this was announced in the autumn statement.

A key part of the plan is to expand urgent care in the community to keep people away from hospitals and for them to instead be treated at home.

As part of this pledge, same-day emergency care units, staffed by consultants and nurses, will open in every hospital with a major A&E; department.

There are also plans for pilots of new approaches to NHS step-down care, with patients receiving rehabilitation and physiotherapy at home in some instances.

But Labour accused the government of ""watering down standards for patients"".

At the turn of the new year, the prime minister made cutting NHS waiting times one of his five priorities.

Announcing the latest emergency care plan, he said: ""Urgent and emergency care is facing serious challenges but we have an ambitious and credible plan to fix it.""

""It will take time to get there but our plan will cut long waiting times by increasing the number of ambulances, staff and beds - stopping the bottlenecks outside A&E; and making sure patients are seen and discharged quickly.

""If we meet this ambition, it will represent one of the fastest and longest sustained improvements in emergency waiting times in NHS history.""

Health Secretary Steve Barclay added: ""Today's plan, which is backed by record investment, aims to rapidly cut waiting times, helping to deliver on one of the government's five priorities, while giving patients the confidence that health and social care services will be there for them when they need them.""

The proposals also include:

• The creation of virtual wards to see patients treated from home while monitored by medics through daily visits or video calls

• Plans to make it easier for NHS staff to move between hospitals and work in services like 111

• More options for call handlers to work from home

• Efforts to expand the number of emergency medical technicians

• Greater use of student and apprentice paramedics

• Training more staff in mental health

The Department of Health said this weekend that 3,000 ""hospital at home"" beds being created before next winter.

Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said ""patients will be waiting longer than is safe"" under the plans.

""13 years of Conservative mismanagement of the NHS has left patients waiting longer than ever before for an ambulance or in A&E;,"" he said.

""Now Rishi Sunak is watering down standards for patients. Even if the NHS achieves his targets, patients will be left waiting longer than is safe.

""Expecting the Conservatives to fix the crisis in the NHS is like expecting an arsonist to put out the fire they started, it is just not going to happen.

""Only Labour can be trusted to provide the investment and reform needed to treat patients on time again. We will train 7,500 more doctors and 10,000 more nurses a year, paid for by abolishing non-doms.""

Ministers want to ensure that 76% of A&E; patients are seen within four hours by next March, while category two ambulance response times - such as suspected strokes, heart attacks, burns and epilepsy - get to an average of 30 minutes over the next year.

The Ukrainian air force has today asked its Western allies to consider donating 24 fighter jets to its cause - in what would be the first military package of its kind.

Last week, numerous nations confirmed donations of battle tanks, including the US and Germany after several days of back and forth.

Now, spokesman Yurii Ihnat has said Ukraine is aiming to secure two fighter squadrons of 12 combat aircraft each.

Mr Ihnat added in an interview with El Pais that it hopes to be given American F-16s, but are also considering French Rafale and Swedish Gripen.

However, a senior defence source in the RAF told the Telegraph ""never say never"" when pressed on provisions - but insisted jets are ""not the priority now"".

We had been working with our contacts for months and the call finally came with just 36 hours' notice.

We needed to make our way from London to Kyiv, a war zone, and be ready for the interview.

We scrambled - the team were all over the UK, including in the pub - and came together at Luton Airport in the early hours of the next morning.

Flying to Moldova took just three hours - it was difficult for me to process that war was so close to home.

Arriving with all the camera gear, body armour and what I thought would be appropriate clothing to interview a wartime leader in a besieged capital city, we decanted from the plane and into two sturdy vehicles.

The journey across the border to Kyiv would take about 10 hours, and the seven-person team settled in.

Bumping along potholed roads in the dark was at best uncomfortable, but we had a deadline to beat - curfew was at 11pm and if we didn't make the hotel by then we'd need to stay outside the city for the night.

The regular border crossing was closed and so we had to opt for a longer route which added time that we just didn't have.

We eventually reached the outskirts of the city, driving along a road where a Sky News crew had almost lost their lives when Russian soldiers took aim at their vehicle some months before.

Finally, we reached the hotel with 10 minutes to spare.

Up early the next morning and we headed to the presidential palace for the interview everyone wanted - a chat with Mr Zelenskyy about NATO, tanks, family, President Putin, and as much else as we could fit into the allocated hour.

Security was intense, heavily armoured personnel stalked the grounds; airport-style scanners checked every piece of our camera equipment; our phones and laptops were confiscated and locked far away from the president.

Sandbags were piled high everywhere - including in the ladies' loo; our passports were checked and checked and checked again.

There had been a spelling error on one of the crew's names which caused much consternation, but finally we were cleared to proceed and made our way to the allocated room.

The angle for the interview was chosen in conjunction with the president's team, they wanted hard-backed, nondescript chairs as with all his previous interviews.

Watch: President Zelenskyy gives Sky's Kay Burley an insight into his daily life and family

I thought leather chesterfields would be more fitting for the chat I had in mind - not just with a politician at war but also a father who was trying to keep his family safe too.

After much discussion, it was agreed the sofas could work. Great, let's go. The clock was ticking and the crew set up swiftly in preparation for the interview we'd planned for months.

Then we waited. And waited. And waited... the delay eating into our precious allotted time.

I walked into a chilly, dimly lit hallway and stopped at the bottom of a sweeping marble staircase.

The juxtaposition seemed incongruous, but war has created an energy crisis in Ukraine and wasting fuel on heat and light isn't necessary, I was told.

Eventually, the president arrived. Bounding down the staircase he offered profuse apologies.

He'd been talking to a world leader - he did say who, but I wasn't really listening - our interview time was slashed in half and I was mentally editing my questions as we walked towards the interview room.

We sat, the interview began ""how are you, Mr President?"" and then a moment that may prove to be a pivotal point in the war, caught on camera.

I was asking about Leopard 2 tanks and how important they would be to Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield.

The German leader, Olaf Scholz, had continued to be nervous about sending the vehicles that would be used against Russian forces.

President Zelenskyy had started his reply and was beginning his regular appeal to the German chancellor when he was quickly interrupted by his aide, who had placed himself in the president's eye-line for the interview.

Mr Scholz had that very second announced that he would send tanks. The moment caught on camera.

The president looked relieved, allowed himself a wry smile and told our viewers he would speak to the leader as soon as our interview had ended.

Time will tell if it was a moment that turned the future of this war.

Too soon our time was up and the president quickly posed for a few photographs before leaving for his much-anticipated phone call with the German leader.

The former prime minister has alleged the Russian leader told him ""I don't want to hurt you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute"" in an ""extraordinary"" conversation which took place in February after he had visited Kyiv.

Mr Johnson, who would become a key backer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration in the months after Russia invaded, made the claim as part of a new BBC Two series looking at how the West grappled with Mr Putin in the years before the war.

The former PM recalled that on the visit to Kyiv he warned Mr Putin that an invasion of Ukraine would be disastrous and there would be tougher Western sanctions on Russia if he did so.

Mr Johnson also said he told the Russian leader that the escalation would only see Western states increase support for Ukraine, meaning ""more NATO, not less NATO"" on Russia's borders.

""He said, 'Boris, you say that Ukraine is not going to join NATO any time soon. [...] What is any time soon?' and I said 'Well it's not going to join NATO for the foreseeable future. You know that perfectively well',"" Mr Johnson said of the call with Mr Putin.

""He sort of threatened me at one point and said, 'Boris, I don't want to hurt you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute', or something like that.

""I think from the very relaxed tone that he was taking, the sort of air of detachment that he seemed to have, he was just playing along with my attempts to get him to negotiate.""

Earlier this month, Mr Johnson made a surprise visit to Ukraine amid renewed scrutiny over his personal finances.

The former prime minister said it was a ""privilege"" to be invited to the war-torn nation by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with whom he had a close working relationship during his time in office.

Downing Street indicated Rishi Sunak was ""supportive"" of the visit, after claims it could undermine his authority on foreign policy.

Mr Johnson was pictured visiting Borodianka near Kyiv - a town heavily damaged by the Russian invasion.

In a statement, Mr Johnson said: ""The suffering of the people of Ukraine has gone on for too long.

""The only way to end this war is for Ukraine to win - and to win as fast as possible. This is the moment to double down and to give the Ukrainians all the tools they need to finish the job.""

A spokesperson for Mr Johnson added that he fully supports UK government policy on Ukraine, including the recent decision to send Challenger 2 tanks.

The ex-prime minister pitched himself as a key ally of Kyiv during his time in Number 10, providing support and calling on Western allies to follow suit in the early days of Russia's invasion last February.

As his scandal-plagued premiership unravelled, Mr Johnson was accused of using trips to Ukraine or phone calls with Mr Zelenskyy as a distraction for crises at home.

""And, you know, when I was growing up in this industry, we were told not to, and if we did, we were difficult.

""And I think this isn't a Hollywood thing - when you're new in a job, you don't want to make waves, you accept a lot of stuff that should be unacceptable, and I needed to have the power to change that and to be on the set that I wanted to be on, and not just that I wanted to be on, that everybody wanted to be on.

""Look, we get to play make believe, it's really fun, but there's long hours involved and there's dangerous stunts and there's, you know, all sorts of things, and I needed it to be a safe place for everyone.""

On Wolf Pack, Gellar is no longer one of the youngest people on set. Her character is an investigator looking into a wildfire that has seemingly awakened a mysterious creature - and in the process changed the lives of two teenagers.

But learning from her own experiences, the star took practical action to ensure younger cast and crew on Wolf Pack were comfortable during filming.

She said: ""I was like, here's my cell phone, call me - and I think it was easier for them to speak to me if something was bothering them.""

She added: ""It's hard when it's your producer, boss, network and everyone has a bottom line - I don't have one, I'm here to make all of this work and work well.

""And by the way, not just for the actors - I said that to the crew, too, to the production assistants: If you're too tired, and the hours are too long, let me know. There's Uber now, there's a really easy way for people not to get in car accidents when they're working, it's nothing to a production to call an Uber and guess what? If production won't pay for it, I'll get you an Uber.""

'The scariest things in life emotionally scare us'

It's 20 years since Buffy ended and Gellar says she was drawn back to the genre not by mythical creatures, but what they represent.

""To me, the scariest things in life are what emotionally scare us, and that's what this monster is that metaphor for and really dealing with anxiety,"" the actress explained.

""You know, that's a word we throw around a lot right now, we're all feeling it, we're bombarded with news 24/7, and what it does and this constant stream of information.

""The idea is that anxiety is actually your body running at peak condition, but we don't know what to do with that, so when you harness that, you can actually make that your superpower - and if we have the tools to really deal with anxiety, what would we be capable of?""

How star got through COVID

But she admits she nearly didn't get involved with Wolf Pack at all - initially saying no when asked to look at the script, joking that it was ""animal instinct"" that took over when she eventually relented.

""The idea of the pack to me just really hit home. It was the right time, you know, we were just coming out of COVID where if it wasn't for my pack, my pod, if you will, I wouldn't have gotten through it,"" Gellar said.

""And what it's like when you don't have that and how lonely that feels.

""I surprised myself when I said yes, it surprised Jeff [Davis - the show's creator], it surprised my team - it was a very just emotional response to material that meant something to me.""

The new powers would allow police officers to intervene before protests become ""highly disruptive"" and give them greater clarity about when they can intervene to stop demonstrators blocking roads or slow marching, the government said.

The amendments to the Public Order Bill are aimed at curbing tactics used by groups such as Just Stop Oil, Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion, according to the home secretary.

On Monday, the bill reaches the report stage in the House of Lords, with debates on measures used by some protesters such as locking-on and tunnelling, the thresholds as to what point the police can intervene, and new stop and search powers.

Under the proposed changes, police would not need to wait for disruption to take place and could shut demonstrations down before they escalate.

Ahead of the debate, Ms Braverman said: ""Enough is enough. Blocking motorways and slow walking in roads delays our life-saving emergency services, stops people getting to work and drains police resources.

""Around 75 days of Just Stop Oil action alone cost the taxpayer £12.5m in policing response. This is simply not fair on the British public.

""I urge colleagues across the House of Lords to pass this measure tonight - it is our duty to stand up for the law-abiding public and protect their right to go about their business.""

Image: Suella Braverman says 'enough is enough'

The Public Order Bill is considered a successor to the controversial Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act passed last year, which was criticised for introducing curbs on the right to protest.

A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: ""Suella Braverman may borrow phrases from popular protest movements, but she is part of an anti-democratic minority that is on the wrong side of history.

Oliver Feeley-Sprague, the military, security and police programme director at Amnesty UK, said: ""This bill, and its last-minute amendments, are deeply draconian and must be called out and rejected before it's too late.

""The right to protest is fundamental to a free and fair society - a right for which people have had to fight long and hard. Without the right to protest, everyone's ability to hold the powerful to account suffers.

Members of the National Education Union (NEU) in England and Wales are due to walk out on Wednesday, with more industrial action planned in the following weeks.

Union leaders will meet Education Secretary Gillian Keegan in a final attempt to break the deadlock.

Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: ""This is the last chance to avoid the strike on Wednesday.

""However, on Friday the Department for Education failed to meet the deadline to its evidence to the teachers' pay review body.

""We can only assume this is because they know that their recommended increase for teachers' pay will not be acceptable to our members and will contradict the evidence they must have put in about teacher recruitment and retention difficulties.

""That said, we hope the secretary of state will bring forward concrete proposals to end this dispute and avert the strike action.""

A source close to the education secretary said she will use the meeting to reiterate her call from over the weekend for teachers to inform schools if they plan to strike.

The Prince's Trust said the age group's happiness and confidence is at its lowest level since it started research 14 years ago, citing the cost of living crisis and looming recession as major factors.

Releasing its 2023 youth index on Monday, the charity revealed young people are least happy about their money and mental health.

The report reveals 57% of young people said the cost of living crisis is their biggest worry for the future, while 34% said the coming recession is their greatest concern.

Some 46% overall said economic uncertainty makes them feel hopeless about the future, rising to 55% for those from poorer backgrounds.

Nearly half, 45%, worry they will never earn enough to support a family, rising to 53% for those from less affluent backgrounds.

The data is from an YouGov online poll of 2,025 16 to 25-year-olds in the UK, carried out between 22 November and 7 December.

Young people's happiness and confidence with money is now lower than when polling began in 2008 during the global financial crisis, the charity added.

While 35% agreed that thinking about money depresses or stresses them, this rose to 39% when those from less affluent backgrounds were asked.

The Prince's Trust's UK chief executive Jonathan Townsend said: ""Having already lived through one of the most turbulent times to be young, this year's Prince's Trust NatWest Youth Index is a warning sign that, post-pandemic, young people's wellbeing has not recovered.

""It reveals that for this generation - the class of COVID - economic uncertainty is having a profound impact on their wellbeing and confidence in achieving their aspirations in the future.

""Most concerningly, the report also suggests that these challenges are hitting young people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds hardest, with those who received free school meals or who are unemployed reporting consistently worse wellbeing in all aspects of life.""

Nicola Bulley was last seen two days ago - on Friday 27 January - at around 9.15am on a footpath by the River Wyre off Garstang Road in the village of St Michael's on Wyre.

Emergency crews including Lancashire Police, Lancashire Fire and Rescue, Bowland Pennine Mountain Rescue team and the North West Underwater Search Team have joined the search.

Police dive teams, fire service drones, search dogs, helicopters and mountain rescue volunteers have been sent to the area.

Lancashire Police said Ms Bulley's dog - a brown Spaniel - has been found close to where she was last seen and hope this might help jog the memory of anyone who saw her at around the same time and who may have information relating to her whereabouts.

She is described as white, 5ft 3ins tall, with light brown shoulder-length hair and she speaks with an Essex accent.

Ms Bulley was last seen wearing a long black gilet jacket with a hood, black jeans and olive green ankle wellies. Her hair was tied into a ponytail.

As well as Inskip and St Michael's on Wyre, she also has links to Thornton Cleveleys.

Police say they are ""extremely concerned"" about her and have urged anyone with information about where she may be to get in touch.

The force said it is keeping an open mind about where she may be, and detectives investigating the circumstances around her disappearance are following a number of lines of enquiry.

By Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor

A senior US general has privately told Defence Secretary Ben Wallace the British Army is no longer regarded as a top-level fighting force, defence sources have revealed.

They said this decline in war-fighting capability - following decades of cuts to save money - needed to be reversed faster than planned in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine.

The sources said Rishi Sunak risked failing in his role as ""wartime prime minister"" unless he took urgent action given the growing security threat posed by Vladimir Putin's Russia.

Offering a sense of the scale of the challenge faced by the army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, it is understood that the UK lacks the ability to defend its skies against the level of missile and drone strikes that Ukraine is enduring.

The European Union has even said President Putin is now at war with the West and NATO.

But the UK's chancellor-turned-prime minister just wants the problem ""to go away"", a second source claimed.

Boris Johnson has claimed Vladimir Putin threatened to kill him with a missile in a call ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The former prime minister has alleged the Russian leader told him ""I don't want to hurt you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute"" in an ""extraordinary"" conversation which took place in February after he had visited Kyiv.

Mr Johnson, who would become a key backer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration in the months after Russia invaded, made the claim as part of a new BBC Two series looking at how the West grappled with Mr Putin in the years before the war.

The former PM recalled that on the visit to Kyiv he warned Mr Putin that an invasion of Ukraine would be disastrous and there would be tougher Western sanctions on Russia if he did so.

Mr Johnson also said he told the Russian leader that the escalation would only see Western states increase support for Ukraine, meaning ""more NATO, not less NATO"" on Russia's borders.

""He said, 'Boris, you say that Ukraine is not going to join NATO any time soon. [...] What is any time soon?' and I said 'Well it's not going to join NATO for the foreseeable future. You know that perfectively well',"" Mr Johnson said of the call with Mr Putin.

""He sort of threatened me at one point and said, 'Boris, I don't want to hurt you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute', or something like that.""

She died on Saturday night of complications from a stroke caused by high blood pressure, her daughter Vanessa Foumberg told Variety.

Her friend Laurie Jacobson paid tribute on social media to Loring, ""in our hearts always as Wednesday Addams"".

""Beautiful, kind, a loving mother, Lisa's legacy in the world of entertainment is huge,"" she wrote.

Loring was six years old when she took the role of Wednesday Addams, the gloomy, death-obsessed, pigtailed daughter of the Addams family.

She played the role for two years from 1964 to 1966.

After 64 episodes of The Addams Family, she was cast in the short-lived sitcom The Pruitts Of Southampton and spy drama The Girl From U.N.C.L.E., before landing a recurring role on As The World Turns from 1980 to 1983.

In 1977 she appeared as Wednesday Addams senior in the television film Halloween with the New Addams Family.

The former prime minister has alleged the Russian leader told him ""I don't want to hurt you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute"" in an ""extraordinary"" conversation which took place in February after he had visited Kyiv.

However, on Monday, the Kremlin accused Mr Johnson of lying, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov telling reporters what he said was not true, or ""more precisely, a lie"".

Mr Johnson, who became a key backer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration in the months after Russia invaded, made the claim as part of a new BBC Two series looking at how the West grappled with Mr Putin in the years before the war.

The former PM recalled that on the visit to Kyiv he warned Mr Putin that an invasion of Ukraine would be disastrous and there would be tougher Western sanctions on Russia if he did so.

Mr Johnson also said he told the Russian leader that the escalation would only see Western states increase support for Ukraine, meaning ""more NATO, not less NATO"" on Russia's borders.

""He said, 'Boris, you say that Ukraine is not going to join NATO any time soon. [...] What is any time soon?' and I said 'Well it's not going to join NATO for the foreseeable future. You know that perfectively well',"" Mr Johnson said of the call with Mr Putin.

""He sort of threatened me at one point and said, 'Boris, I don't want to hurt you, but with a missile, it would only take a minute', or something like that.

""I think from the very relaxed tone that he was taking, the sort of air of detachment that he seemed to have, he was just playing along with my attempts to get him to negotiate.""

Earlier this month, Mr Johnson made a surprise visit to Ukraine amid renewed scrutiny over his personal finances.

The former prime minister said it was a ""privilege"" to be invited to the war-torn nation by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with whom he had a close working relationship during his time in office.

Downing Street indicated Rishi Sunak was ""supportive"" of the visit, after claims it could undermine his authority on foreign policy.

Mr Johnson was pictured visiting Borodianka near Kyiv - a town heavily damaged by the Russian invasion.

In a statement, Mr Johnson said: ""The suffering of the people of Ukraine has gone on for too long.

""The only way to end this war is for Ukraine to win - and to win as fast as possible. This is the moment to double down and to give the Ukrainians all the tools they need to finish the job.""

A spokesperson for Mr Johnson added that he fully supports UK government policy on Ukraine, including the recent decision to send Challenger 2 tanks.

The ex-prime minister pitched himself as a key ally of Kyiv during his time in Number 10, providing support and calling on Western allies to follow suit in the early days of Russia's invasion last February.

As his scandal-plagued premiership unravelled, Mr Johnson was accused of using trips to Ukraine or phone calls with Mr Zelenskyy as a distraction for crises at home.

Defence sources revealed the US general said this decline in war-fighting capability needed to be reversed faster than planned in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine.

They told Sky News' defence and security editor Deborah Haynes this should include increasing the defence budget by at least £3bn a year and halting a plan to shrink the size of the army further.

Responding to the US general's comments, defence committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said people should be ""very concerned"" about the Armed Forces' current capabilities.

The senior Tory called on the government to reverse ""swathing cuts"" to the army because its equipment has become ""obsolete"".

Mr Ellwood said there had been ""huge investments"" into the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force in recent years, but added: ""The army is in a dire state.""

He continued: ""Our army is simply too small, we have cut down by 10,000 troops.

""I do hope the defence review will look at these issues and reverse some of the swathing cuts that were made a couple of years ago.

""It is up to the Treasury and Number 10 to recognise the world is changing - we are now at war in Europe, we need to move to a war footing.

""We have become complacent. We need invest to make sure we retain people, the good people that are there, but there are not enough of them and the equipment is now obsolete.""

He pointed out that the UK's armoured fleet of Challenge Twos, Warriors, and Scimitars, are all ""over 20, 30 or 50 years old without any upgrades"".

""I'm pleased that voices are now coming through to say this is unacceptable,"" Mr Ellwood said.

""We've whittled down our capability - we had 900 tanks a couple of decades [ago], we're now going down to 148.""

The defence committee chairman added that a tilt to ""cyber a space security"" is necessary, ""but that doesn't mean you do it at a cost of your land forces"".

European powers like France and Germany have announced plans to boost defence spending significantly following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.

Mr Sunak has yet to make any meaningful pledge to expand his defence coffers, instead pursuing a ""refresh"" of a review of defence policy that is due to be published on 7 March ahead of a spring budget that will signal whether there is any new money for the military.

The crisis in defence has been a generation in the making following repeated reductions in the size of the three armed services since the end of the Cold War by successive Conservative, coalition and Labour governments to save money for peacetime priorities.

In addition, the need to supply Ukraine with much of the army's remaining stocks of weapons and ammunition to help the Ukrainian military fight Russia has increased the pressure even further.

In 2020, Boris Johnson, as prime minister, increased defence spending by £16bn - the biggest uplift since the Cold War, but not enough to plug the gaps.

The jabs are not part of the NHS childhood immunisation schedule, but the committee which advises UK health departments on shots is considering whether to recommend they be added.

About three-quarters of parents would support routine chickenpox jabs for their children, according to new research published in the journal Vaccine.

Dr Sue Sherman, author of the study and reader in psychology at Keele University, said that while usually mild, chickenpox can be a ""severe illness"" for some youngsters and may lead to hospitalisation and death.

For most, it causes spots, high temperature and headaches, and - because it is more serious for adults - parents sometimes deliberately expose their children to the infection to ensure they catch it while they are young.

Study co-author Professor Helen Bedford, professor of children's health at University College London, said: ""This is sometimes done at 'chickenpox parties'.""

But this is not recommended, she warned, because in rare cases chickenpox infection may result in pneumonia, bacterial infections and swelling in the brain.

Children who have recently had the infection, which is caused by the varicella zoster virus, are also more likely to develop serious forms of Strep A.

Strep A cases have been much higher than normal this winter, likely as a result of withdrawing protective health measures implemented during the COVID pandemic.

Currently, chickenpox jabs are only available to people who demonstrate a clinical need, such as those who are not immune and in close contact with someone who has a weakened immune system.

But they are offered to children routinely in other countries, including the US, Japan and Australia.

Professor Bedford added: ""Adding the chickenpox vaccine to the schedule will ensure that children are protected against the infection.""

Parents can be ""reassured"" that it is used around the world and ""has a good safety record"", she added.

The committee looking into chickenpox jabs is the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advised UK health departments on who should get COVID shots.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130103258/http://news.sky.com/story/giving-children-chickenpox-vaccine-could-end-risky-pox-parties-12799051

The budget airline continued to perform better than its pre-COVID years as pent-up demand during October half-terms and Christmas and New Year breaks resulted in ""strong"" passenger numbers and fares across the board.

Passenger numbers rose to 38.4 million over the three months, a 24% increase from the 31.1 million who travelled with Ryanair over the same period in 2019.

Similarly, fares rose 14% over the three months last year compared the same three months in 2019. The rises were seen most during peak travel periods when demand was pent up, the airline said.

That trend is expected to continue, the carrier's third-quarter results for 2023 said, as it's seeing ""robust demand"" for Easter and summer 2023 flights.

The quarterly profit announced on Monday morning surpassed the €88m (£77.16m) profit after tax booked during the comparable three-month period in 2019 before COVID lockdowns limited the aviation industry's ability to operate.

The vast majority of staff (95%) had pay cuts restored by December, 28 months earlier than the 2025 cut-off, Ryanair reported.

New long-term pay agreements were brought in during the December payroll and Ryanair said it was ""available to conclude agreements on similar terms"" with the remaining 5% of crews who have so far yet to reach an agreement.

Cuts had been made to workers' pay during the pandemic as the airline's revenue took a nosedive.

UK cabin crew reached a deal last October when Ryanair agreed pay and working conditions with the Unite union, resulting in a work pattern of five days on and three days off.

The record profit announcement continues its run of positive results. Last year, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers was performing better than before lockdowns began.

Record passenger numbers in the second quarter and higher fares had resulted in a profit of €1.37bn (£1.2bn) for the first half of the 2023 financial year. The company's 2024 financial year will begin in April.

Earlier this month the company announced updated profit guidance of full-year profit of €1.32bn (£1.15bn) to €1.425bn (£1.25bn) which the Q3 results confirmed. Profits had previously been expected to be in the region of €1bn to (£87m)€1.2bn (£1.05bn).#

""We are taking this incident very seriously. We recognise this is clearly very concerning and are sorry for the alarm it has caused in the Western Australian community,"" Simon Trott, chief executive of Rio Tinto's iron ore division, said in a statement.

""As well as fully supporting the relevant authorities, we have launched our own investigation to understand how the capsule was lost in transit.""

Image: The truck carrying the radioactive unit was travelling from a Rio Tinto mine in Western Australia to a depot in Perth

The mining giant and Australian authorities now face the daunting task of finding the tiny but potentially deadly 8mm by 6mm unit, which is smaller than a penny.

The small silver cylinder contains caesium-137, a highly radioactive isotope which emits the equivalent of 10 X-rays in an hour.

It fell off the back of a truck while being transported 870 miles (1,400km) from a mine in Newman to a depot in the Perth suburb of Malaga by a specialist contractor on 12 January.

Rio Tinto said it was told by the contractor that the capsule was missing on 25 January.

Authorities suspect vibrations from the truck caused the screws and the bolt to come loose, and the radioactive capsule from the gauge fell out of the package and then out of a gap in the vehicle.

A radiation alert across Western Australia remains in place and authorities have told people to stay at least five metres (16.5ft) away as exposure could cause radiation burns or sickness, though they add that the risk to the general community is relatively low.

The state's emergency services have set up a hazard management team and have brought in specialist equipment that includes portable radiation detectors. The devices can detect radiation levels across a 20-metre radius, and be used from moving vehicles.

The entire 870-mile route will likely have to be searched until the missing unit is found.

Mr Trott said the mining corporation has carried out radiological surveys across the Gudai-Darri mine site where the device had been, as well as the connecting access road.

The task, while akin to finding the proverbial needle in a haystack, is ""not impossible"" as searchers are equipped with radiation detectors, said Andrew Stuchbery from the department of nuclear physics and accelerator applications at the Australian National University.

""That's like if you dangled a magnet over a haystack, it's going to give you more of a chance,"" he said.

Speaking in Country Durham at the launch of his government's emergency care plan, the prime minister defended his handling of situation and stressed his commitment to ""integrity"" and the need to follow proper processes.

""What I have done is follow a process, which is the right process,"" he said.

""Integrity is really important to me - all of you guys want to see that government is run properly, that it is run with integrity and there's accountability when people don't behave in the way that they should or if something doesn't go right, and that's what we've done.""

Mr Sunak also promised he would ""take whatever steps are necessary to restore the integrity back into politics"".

""The things that happened before I was prime minister, I can't do anything about,"" the prime minister said.

""What I think you can hold me to account for is how I deal with the things that arise on my watch.

""And as you've seen, you know, when it came to Nadhim Zahawi, I asked the independent adviser to look at it straight away, acted on his findings straight away.

""That should give you some confidence that these things matter to me, and that I will take whatever steps are necessary to restore the integrity back into politics, and you can have confidence that the process works.""

Mr Zahawi was sacked as Tory party chairman on Sunday after an ethics inquiry into the handling of his tax affairs found a ""serious breach"" of the ministerial code.

Mr Sunak had resisted earlier calls from opposition parties to fire Mr Zahawi following reports that he had paid a penalty as part of an estimated £4.8m settlement dispute with HMRC.

But following the conclusion of an inquiry into the matter by his new ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus - which found that Mr Zahawi had ""shown insufficient regard for the general principles of the ministerial code"" - Mr Sunak swiftly removed the former Tory chairman from his post.

Critics of Mr Sunak have said he should have acted sooner in dismissing Mr Zahawi.

But the prime minister said it was on the basis of the facts contained in Sir Laurie's report released on Sunday morning that he was ""able to make a very quick decision that it was no longer appropriate for Nadhim Zahawi to continue in government"".

Ms Dodds described Mr Sunak as ""weak"" for not sacking Mr Zahawi ""when this murky affair first surfaced"".

Ms Rayner added: ""Rishi Sunak shouldn't have needed an ethics adviser to tell him that Nadhim Zahawi's position was untenable, but instead he continued to prop up the man he appointed to cabinet.""

Asked whether he believed Mr Sunak has lied about what he knew of the matter, Mr Thomas-Symonds replied: ""How could the prime minister not have known about the fact of the investigation when Mr Zahawi declared it in July?""

The row surrounding Mr Zahawi had centred on a tax bill over the sale of shares in YouGov - the polling firm he founded worth an estimated £27m - which were held by Balshore Investments, a company registered offshore in Gibraltar and linked to Mr Zahawi's family.

Mr Zahawi had insisted he was ""confident"" he had ""acted properly throughout"".

The flight took off from Dubai on Friday just before 11am (local time) and was halfway through the 9,000-mile journey when it had to circle back to the United Arab Emirates.

Auckland Airport was closed to all international and domestic flights on Friday, with more than 2,000 passengers forced to stay overnight in the terminals.

Auckland Airport apologised to passengers impacted by the closure.

In a statement on Saturday, airport chief executive Carrie Hurihanganui said it had been a ""really long and challenging night"".

""Our teams, and those of our airport partners, continue to work around the clock to make sure we can get our domestic and international terminal operations open safely as soon as possible,"" she said.

The airport was reopened to domestic flights at lunchtime on Saturday and international flights on Sunday morning.

Police say no arrests have been made.

Details of the victims have not been released, although police said the owner of the house was among the dead.

""These victims were killed by criminals, and we will not rest until we find out what happened and who was responsible for [this] callous and cold-blooded attack on these unsuspecting victims,"" said Eastern Cape police commissioner Nomthetheleli Lillian Mene.

The latest incident follows a spate of mass shootings last year across the nation.

In July, attackers shot 19 people dead in random shootings within hours of each other.

Sky News has learnt that Apax Partners, the London-based buyout firm, has agreed to inject £60m into Matchesfashion, which sells brands including Gucci, Prada and Valentino.

The new capital will be split between £40m in equity and £20m in debt, with the latter element expected to be finalised in the short term.

In tandem with the extra funds, Matchesfashion is said to have secured covenant waivers and extensions with all of its lenders.

The additional financing underlines both the challenges that Apax has faced since acquiring Matchesfashion in 2017 and its confidence in new chief executive Nick Beighton's turnaround plan.

Mr Beighton, the former ASOS boss, was appointed last summer, the latest in a string of CEOs to be hired by Apax during more than five years of ownership.

In a statement on Monday responding to an enquiry from Sky News, a spokeswoman for the company said: ""Matchesfashion offers luxury brands an exclusive audience and our customers love the service we provide.

""Our trading performance has been very strong in recent months and we are well-positioned as a business, having significantly strengthened our top team.

""Now, with additional financial support from Apax Funds, we are well-placed to continue to drive our turnaround plan and deliver long-term commercial success.""

The business is already said to have seen positive results under Mr Beighton, with one source saying that order demand was up 15% year-on-year during the key pre-Christmas trading period.

This period also included Matchesfashion's biggest-ever trading day, which was up 35% on the prior year, the source added.

Its performance is understood to have been especially robust in the Middle East.

Apax bought a controlling stake in Matchesfashion in a deal valued at about $1bn, but the investment has been beset by operational problems.

Mr Beighton was drafted in to replace Paolo De Cesare, who joined the company as chief executive just ten months earlier.

The former ASOS chief's arrival made him the fourth boss of Matches in less than three years.

In November 2021, its accounts flagged ""material uncertainty"" over its future without an improvement in its trading performance.

Its fortunes resembled those of many online fashion retailers, which saw a COVID-inspired sales bounce evaporate.

Last week, Sky News revealed that ASOS had appointed Scott Millar, a senior financial restructuring executive, to join its finance team.

Mr Beighton spent more than a decade at ASOS, initially as chief financial officer before becoming CEO in 2015.

He helped grow the company from £178m in revenue and 150 people when he joined, to sales of £3.9bn and a workforce of 15,000, including warehouse staff, when he left.

Matches was founded at a single store in London in 1987, and now boasts 50m visitors annually to its site.

Its closest rivals include Farfetch and Net-a-Porter.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130120221/http://news.sky.com/story/matchesfashion-owner-pumps-in-60m-to-keep-online-retailer-in-shape-12799098

Eleanor Woods was presented with a real-world incarnation of her product in London over the weekend, having won over judges with a hi-tech satchel that ""looks cool, will help get kids outside, and fights off colds"".

All that and it will still carry her textbooks, stationary and homework.

The 12-year-old, from High Burton, Huddersfield, said the inspiration for her Breathe Better Backpack came from her mother's asthma, which she was especially aware of during the COVID lockdowns.

""I have an air filter at home because my mum has mild asthma,"" she said, adding that it was also designed to help friends and classmates stay safe.

""My generation is really aware of pollution and we have lessons on it at school along with diseases spreading.

""This is another reason I designed this, because it is getting much worse.""

'I can taste the petrol'

Eleanor, for whom climate activist Greta Thunberg is a ""big role model"", said she can ""taste the petrol"" outside when walking to school from her home on a main road.

She drew up her solution when her mum, Annabel Hobbs, 58, put a Backpack To The Future form in her room.

Her creation is powered by solar energy and a dynamo, which is a machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, and has a built-in filter and fans to clean the air.

It's blue and decorated with bubbles, which Eleanor said gave the backpack a ""clean theme"".

""If just a few people start using it, it could be really good for the planet,"" she added.

Police say they are growing increasingly concerned that missing Nathan Cole, from Notting Hill in west London, ""may have come to harm"".

Mr Cole, was last seen in the Walthamstow area of northeast London at 23.17pm on Saturday, 21 January, having earlier visited a shop in the area to buy four cans of beer.

He may have travelled to the area to meet with friends or to attend a party or gathering, according to Detective Sergeant Julie Morrow from the Metropolitan Police's Central West Missing Persons Unit.

She said: ""More than a week has gone by since Nathan's family had any contact with him.

""They are obviously extremely worried and while we are doing all we can to support them we really need the public's help as we continue our search.

""We hope very much that we will find Nathan safe and well but with each day that passes, our concerns that he may have come to harm increase.""

DS Morrow said Mr Cole, who according to reports had recently started a new job, had been described as ""outgoing and gregarious"" and a ""very sociable"" person, who would ""engage in conversations with anyone"".

Police say Mr Cole was seen buying the cans of beer at a shop in Blackhorse Lane at 10.05pm on 21 January before boarding a 158 bus in the direction of Chingford.

He was seen getting off the bus outside Walthamstow Academy, close to the junction of Academy Way and Billet Road, at 10.55pm, before being picked up on residential CCTV walking along Billet Road around 10 minutes later.

At 11.17pm, he was seen on CCTV walking west along nearby Banbury Road in the direction of the River Lea.

While the footage from Banbury Road is the last confirmed sighting of Mr Cole, officers believe his phone was active in the vicinity of the former Ikea store in Glover Drive, Edmonton, at 0.41am on the Sunday morning.

So far there has been no confirmation that Nathan was in possession of his phone at that time.

DS Morrow said: ""We urgently want to hear from anyone who saw Nathan late on the night of Saturday, 21 January, early the following morning or at any time since.

""We would ask anyone who lives in the area he was last seen to check any CCTV or doorbell cameras.

""We would also like to hear from anyone who spoke to Nathan on the night, who knew of his plans or who knows where he might have gone or who he might have been meeting.

It comes amid a warning that jobs could be lost next year as councils seek to 'balance their books'.

Members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) union began 16 days of industrial action on Monday 16 January.

The protests, which will be held in two of Scotland's 32 local authority areas each day until 6 February, continued in Aberdeenshire and the Borders on Monday.

'Scotland's teachers are not going to back down'

In an update ahead of the fresh week of strikes, EIS General Secretary Andrea Bradley accused the Scottish government and Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) of ""inaction"" to settle the dispute.

She said: ""Scotland's teachers have responded magnificently in recent weeks, supporting ongoing strike action in their tens of thousands right across the country.

""On strike days, schools have closed and the streets have been ablaze with the bright green and pink EIS pay campaign colours, with teachers on the picket lines and attending demonstrations and rallies right across Scotland.

""Teachers do not want to be there, and would much rather be in class working to support young people's education - but, having been compelled to take strike action by the inaction of the Scottish government and COSLA on pay, Scotland's teachers are not going to back down.""

Unions have rejected a pay offer which would see most teachers receive a 5% wage rise, although the lowest earners would get an increase of 6.85%.

The Scottish government has previously insisted the 10% rise teachers are demanding is unaffordable.

The EIS has already planned further industrial action on 28 February and 1 March, followed by a rolling programme of strikes for 20 days between 13 March and 21 April.

COSLA claimed both parties ""still remain a distance apart in terms of a settlement"" amid a warning that jobs could be lost next year as councils seek to 'balance their books'.

Councillor Katie Hagmann, COSLA spokesperson for resources, said: ""We remain in discussions with our trade union and Scottish government partners as we endeavour to find areas for agreement.

""Strikes in education are in nobody's interest and all parties are eager to seek a resolution that not only protects the teaching and wider local government workforce, but also our children and young people's educational experience.

""COSLA leaders are clear that given the financial pressures being faced it remains the case that the 10% ask of the trade unions remains unaffordable and therefore we still remain a distance apart in terms of a settlement.

""Given the local government settlement for 23/24, what teachers are asking for, over and above the current offer, is simply not sustainable on a recurring basis.

""Already, councils are considering a range of options to balance the books next year and options will inevitably include a reduction in jobs across all service areas, including schools.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130120221/http://news.sky.com/story/scotlands-teachers-wont-back-down-with-strike-action-amid-warning-jobs-could-be-lost-as-councils-seek-to-balance-their-books-12799109

The US criticism that the British Army is no longer considered a top-tier fighting force will be music to Vladimir Putin's ears, a retired senior officer has said.

Sky's security and defence editor Deborah Haynes has an exclusive report of a US general warning the UK's defence secretary Ben Wallace about the state of the UK's armed forces.

Asked if the criticism would be ""music to Putin's ears"" by Sky News' Kay Burley, Sir Simon Mayall, former deputy chief of defence staff, agreed and said Mr Putin would have taken the state of the UK's armed forces into consideration when he invaded Ukraine.

""This is partly behind his calculation when he went into Ukraine,"" he said.

""We still invest a lot. But we've got to be realistic about the threats we face.

""And I think Putin when he looked at going into Ukraine - he looked at political will, he looked at the reality of what the great armies might be able to do - must have thought I'll factor that into my gamble.

""They [Western nations] are not ready to contribute anything other than good words for a number of years to come.""

He said the Ukraine war had shown conflicts often have a ""huge attrition rate"".

""And what we've sadly proved in Ukraine is not only do you need an organisation with breadth but you need depth as well.

""The casualties are horrendous there, and it is a war of attrition and logistics as well. So it's not simply numbers of tanks or even soldiers, it's just how much underpins it in terms of spare parts, in terms of replacement vehicles, in terms of ammunition.""

The song also features the singer Popnick, who does such a brilliant job imitating Astley's voice that to the untrained ear, it sounds indistinguishable from the real deal.

Astley is claiming the use of the impersonator is illegal.

What does the lawsuit say?

Astley filed the lawsuit on Thursday 26 January at Los Angeles Superior Court.

His complaint says the song violates his right of publicity - or the right to control the commercial exploitation of a person's identity and prevent its unauthorised commercial appropriation by others - by featuring Popnick's impersonation.

""In an effort to capitalise off the immense popularity and goodwill of Mr Astley, defendants... conspired to include a deliberate and nearly indistinguishable imitation of Mr Astley's voice,"" the lawsuit says. ""The public could not tell the difference.""

Astley's lawsuit seeks ""millions of dollars"" in damages, as well as profits from the song.

According to the singer's team, ""a licence to use the original underlying musical composition does not authorise the stealing of the artist's voice in the original recording"".

Yung Gravy and Popnick are among the defendants, along with Yung Gravy's record label, Universal Music Group's Republic Records.

The complaint states that Astley's claim resembles a 1988 case in which Bette Midler successfully sued Ford Motor Co for using a soundalike to sell vehicles, even though Ford had licensed her song Do You Want To Dance for an advert.

Who is Yung Gravy?

Real name Matthew Hauri, Yung Gravy is a 26-year-old rapper who was born in Rochester, Minnesota. He rose to prominence following the release of his 2016 debut single, Mr Clean, which went on to be certified platinum.

Betty (Get Money) is his most successful track to date, reaching number 30 on the US Billboard chart and going viral on TikTok.

In an interview with Billboard following the song's release, he spoke about the Astley sample, saying: ""I always thought that sample would be sick to do something with. I just never figured it was clearable.

""Somebody who had part-ownership of the rights to the sample hit me up like, 'We f*** with you, you should try it out'... we basically remade the whole song. Had a different singer and instruments, but it was all really close because it makes it easier legally.

""We said, 'Let's try to clear it and see what happens'. At first, two of the three writers that had to approve it, approved it, and one guy wanted us to make it a little bit cleaner.""

Sky News has contacted representatives for the rapper, and for his label, for comment on the lawsuit.

Astley, 56, is an English singer-songwriter who rose to fame through the Stock Aitken Waterman label - also home to Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan - in the 1980s. Never Gonna Give You Up was his biggest hit, topping charts around the world.

About 20 years later, the song saw a resurgence thanks to the Rickroll internet meme, in which the track unexpectedly interrupts unrelated content.

In 2021, the song passed a billion views on YouTube.

Other famous music lawsuits

Astley's lawyer Richard Busch is known for representing Marvin Gaye's family against Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams over their alleged copying of the song Got To Give It Up for their 2013 hit Blurred Lines.

There have been numerous other disputes over music rights in recent years.

945;Ryan Reynolds's Wrexham could draw Premier League giants like Manchester United in FA Cup;Monday 30 January 2023 12:46, UK;[];['ryan reynolds', 'wrexham fc'];['club', 'draw', 'cup', 'reynoldss', 'ryan', 'manchester', 'national', 'premier', 'fa', 'reynolds', 'league', 'giants', 'united', 'wrexham'];"Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have already brought a touch of Hollywood to Wrexham - now the club could be at the heart of a true FA Cup blockbuster.

The Welsh football side could face Manchester United or Manchester City - two of England's biggest clubs - in Monday night's FA Cup fifth-round draw.

It comes after the National League outfit came just minutes from pulling off a famous David-and-Goliath-style giant-killing against Sheffield United - a team three leagues above them in England's football pyramid - on Sunday night.

A late equaliser meant Wrexham were forced to settle for a 3-3 draw - and a tough away replay - against their Championship opponents.

Club co-owner Reynolds, star of Marvel hit Deadpool, watched on from the stands as the emotional rollercoaster of a match played out below, later describing it as ""one of the most exciting things I've ever seen"".

Tweeting after the match, he said: ""When Rob and I got into this it all felt so impossible. But impossible is Wrexham's favourite colour.

""That was one of the most exciting things I've EVER seen. Thank you each and every Wrexham supporter who came out and aimed your heart at that pitch tonight.""

Speaking to the media before the match, Reynolds also reiterated his desire to push the club into the Premier League.

While Wrexham fans will no doubt share the actor's lofty ambitions, the club still has a long way to go, sitting four leagues below English football's promised land.

But they could get a taste of Premier League life if they can win their FA Cup replay away at Sheffield United on 7 February - and draw one of the remaining big teams in the competition.

Wrexham, the only remaining National League side, could also face Premier League sides Tottenham, West Ham, Leicester City or Brighton.

However, it will be a tie with 12-time winners Manchester United or current Premier League champions Manchester City that will really fit the Hollywood script for Wrexham.

It could prove a lucrative tie for the National League side, too. A draw against a Premier League side could earn Wrexham more than £200,000 in TV broadcasting income.

In 2017, Sutton United, then in the National League, earned £710,000 from an FA Cup run where they were eventually knocked out by Arsenal in the fifth round.

Wrexham still have to overcome Sheffield United in next month's replay - but will be hopeful though of pulling off an upset.

Image: Wrexham's Paul Mullin has scored in the first four rounds of the FA Cup proper this season

On Sunday, the club became the first non-League team since the creation of the Football League in 1888 to score three goals in the first, second, third and fourth rounds of the competition.

They beat Oldham 3-0 in the first round, followed by a 4-1 win against Farnborough in the second, before beating Coventry City 4-3 in a dramatic third-round tie.

And they will be buoyed by the sensational form of striker Paul Mullin, whose goal on Sunday meant he became the first player since 1984-85 from a non-League club to net consecutive goals in the first, second, third and fourth rounds of the FA Cup.

Yesterday, Sky News revealed a US general privately told the defence secretary the UK's Armed Forces are no longer regarded as a top-level fighting force.

Defence sources revealed the US general said this decline in war-fighting capability needed to be reversed faster than planned in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine.

They told Sky News' defence and security editor Deborah Haynes this should include increasing the defence budget by at least £3bn a year and halting a plan to shrink the size of the army further.

But asked about the US general's private comments on Monday, the prime minister's official spokesman said ""yes"" to Mr Sunak believing that the British Army is a top-level fighting force.

The spokesman said the government planned to spend £242bn on equipment procurement and support over 10 years.

""I don't agree with him at all,"" he told Sky News.

""You can find any American general to give you one opinion or another.

""The fact is that the British Armed Forces might have been weakened recently but they are still a formidable fighting force - and I think our country can be proud of them.""

He continued: ""I think it is a subjective judgement by individual commanders and they vary, they come and go.

""And although I have got my criticisms of what the government is doing and how it is conducting its defence at the moment, I would not agree with that and I don't think the majority of people in America and in the American military would agree with that particular sentiment.""

Earlier today, Conservative defence committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said people should be ""very concerned"" about the Armed Forces' current capabilities.

The senior Tory called on the government to reverse ""swathing cuts"" to the army because its equipment has become ""obsolete"".

Mr Ellwood said there had been ""huge investments"" into the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force in recent years, but added: ""The army is in a dire state.""

He continued: ""Our army is simply too small, we have cut down by 10,000 troops.

""I do hope the defence review will look at these issues and reverse some of the swathing cuts that were made a couple of years ago.

""It is up to the Treasury and Number 10 to recognise the world is changing - we are now at war in Europe, we need to move to a war footing.

""We have become complacent. We need to invest to make sure we retain people, the good people that are there, but there are not enough of them and the equipment is now obsolete.""

European powers like France and Germany have announced plans to boost defence spending significantly following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.

Mr Sunak has yet to make any meaningful pledge to expand his defence coffers, instead pursuing a ""refresh"" of a review of defence policy that is due to be published on 7 March ahead of a spring budget that will signal whether there is any new money for the military.

The crisis in defence has been a generation in the making following repeated reductions in the size of the three armed services since the end of the Cold War by successive Conservative, coalition and Labour governments to save money for peacetime priorities.

In 2020, Boris Johnson, as prime minister, increased defence spending by £16bn - the biggest uplift since the Cold War, but not enough to plug the gaps.

Dramatic footage from Brazil shows the motorist losing control of the vehicle as it careers off the road into the path of a motorcyclist, knocking him off his bike and into the air.

As the motorcyclist crashes down on the road, the driver continues to swerve and hits a pot plant in front of a driving school.

Image: The girl can be seen playing behind the pot plant before the car swerves into it - and her

A child can be seen playing behind the large pot plant which is struck with such force that it - and the girl - are sent crashing through the window of the premises.

Glass shatters everywhere and the girl hits a large seat in the building before coming to a stop - and immediately gets up and rushes into the arms of a man outside who whisks her away.

Image: Security cameras recorded the moment when the five-year-old was hit - and the aftermath, which shows her walking away from the crash

Images show he was initially sat down next to her by the pot plant, but managed to spot the out-of-control car and get out of the way before it struck.

Security cameras from inside the building show a person behind the vehicle - which ends up part lodged on the pavement and it's front inside the office.

The crash happened on Saturday afternoon in the central region of Bonito, according to local police.

The total number of subscriptions to services such as Netflix in England, Wales and Scotland fell from 30.54 million in the final three months of 2021 to 28.46 million by the end of 2022, according to data from analytics company Kantar.

Along with the number of subscriptions declining, the number of people having at least one paid-for subscription fell from 17.12 million in the final three months of 2021 to 16.24 million by the final quarter of 2022.

Many people took out new subscriptions in the run up to Christmas last year but the figures show the pace slowed: 5% of households in Britain signed up to a new streaming subscription during the final quarter of the year, down from 6% a year earlier.

Sign ups to Prime Video, AppleTV+ and Paramount+ drove the rise.

The increase is likely to be short lived as one in every 10 consumers plans to cancel one or more subscriptions early this year, Kantar said.

The shimmering colours brightened up the sky on Sunday evening and Monday morning.

Known as one of the highest in our atmosphere - these clouds often come together in cold conditions, BBC reports.

So what are Nacreous clouds?

These clouds take the shape of large, thin discs - reflecting vivid colours.

According to the Met Office, the old English word for ""Nacre"" means ""mother of pearl"".

These rare clouds are known for their coloured light.

""The colours are reminiscent of the colours which reflect from a thin layer of oil on top of the water, an effect known as iridescence,"" as stated on the Met Office website.

How do they form?

The clouds form in the lower layer of the earth's atmosphere - over polar regions when the sun is just below the horizon.

The ice particles then form nacreous clouds, these ice particles are much smaller than those that create normal clouds.

The sun then reflects off of these tiny ice particles, which brings out their pearly streaks - scattering into different colours of light.

The Met Office added: ""Due to their high altitude and the curvature of the Earth's surface, these clouds are lit up by sunlight from below the horizon and reflect it to the ground, shining brightly well before dawn and after dusk.""

Nacreous clouds tend to form in very cold and dry weather conditions and are rarely spotted in the UK.

Craigievar's multiple turrets and pink walls are famous features of the castle, but these have been challenged by extreme weather.

The National Trust of Scotland (NTS) is undertaking the revamp, having replaced the wall's finish in 2009, but capricious weather patterns caused by climate change means more work is needed to ensure the castle can withstand the increasingly wet weather.

Iain Hawkins, a regional director for NTS, said: ""Craigievar holds a special place in the hearts and minds of the local community, across Scotland and indeed globally, thanks in no small part to the castle's famous pink exterior introduced in 1824 by Sir John Forbes.""

The castle embraces the Scottish Baronial style and is among the best-preserved tower houses in Scotland.

The trust is urging people to support its ""Pink Again"" campaign to raise funds for the restoration.

NTS completed a similar project at the Hill House in Helensburgh, by architect Charles Mackintosh.

Following public outcry, the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) moved Bryson to another prison on Thursday.

The row continued over the weekend when reports emerged that Tiffany Scott - who had been convicted of stalking a 13-year-old girl before her transition from Andrew Burns - would be sent to a female unit, reports which were denied by Mr Brown.

On Sunday, the justice secretary announced a pause to transgender prisoners with convictions for violence against women being moved to the female estate, along with an urgent review of the handling of the Bryson case.

Speaking on Monday, Mr Brown said a decision on Scott's placement ""wasn't taken"" and had not been given approval from the risk management authority.

He also said he understands that none of the five trans women currently in the female estate has a history of violence against women.

Mr Brown said: ""This changes, as you can imagine, on a regular basis, but my understanding is there are no transgender women in the female estate that have violence against women convictions.""

However, he added that, in exceptional circumstances, a trans woman could be moved to the female estate, but that would require the approval of Scottish ministers before a decision is taken.

Mr Brown said the SPS is ""taking their time"" to make sure they get the review ""right"", adding that the Scottish government will look at creating a specific unit for trans prisoners if that is what the review recommends.

Asked if Bryson and Scott are transgender women or violent males attempting to manipulate the system, Mr Brown said: ""If someone presents as a trans person, then we accept that at face value; what we do not accept is that that gives them the right to go to the prison estate of their choosing.""

Tensions around the issue of gender recognition have been heightened in recent months by the passage of Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill in December - legislation that would make it easier for trans people to obtain a gender recognition certificate.

Opponents of the Bill raised concerns about the impact on women and girls, while its supporters said it is a minor administrative change.

The UK government moved to block the Bill from becoming law by using, for the first time, Section 35 of the Scotland Act.

Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) voted for action in a ballot that closed on Monday - resulting in the UK's first nationwide fire service strike over pay since 2003.

Firefighters have experienced a 12% drop in real-terms earnings since 2010, the union says, while around one in five firefighter jobs have been cut in the same period.

It comes after members rejected a below-inflation 5% payoff in November.

Polling previously showed strong public support for strike action by firefighters, the union said, with around three in five people backing action.

FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: ""Firefighters have faced a sustained attack on pay for more than a decade, with average pay falling by about £4,000 in real terms.

""Our members face hazardous situations every day and sometimes risk their health to do the job.

""Facing double-digit inflation and rocketing energy bills, they are now being told to put up with an even bigger real-terms pay cut.""

964;How the pandemic has meant that 2022 has seen a high turnover of chief executives;Monday 30 January 2023 15:20, UK;['ian king', '@iankingsky'];[];['business', 'executive', 'sir', 'nigel', 'luck', 'departure', 'high', 'meant', 'turnover', 'seen', 'executives', 'chief', 'life', '2022', 'pandemic'];"Less than a month into the year and two of the UK's biggest companies have already signalled a change of leadership.

Penny James stepped down on Friday as chief executive of Direct Line following a shock profits warning days earlier that wiped out a quarter of the general insurer's stock market value.

Then, on Monday morning, life insurance giant Legal & General announced its chief executive of the last 11 years, Sir Nigel Wilson, is stepping down.

The two events have little in common.

Sir Nigel, who is 66, has been at the helm for more than a decade - no mean feat when the average longevity of a FTSE-100 chief executive is just five years.

His services will be in demand should he choose to extend his boardroom career as a non-executive chairman.

Ms James, by contrast, probably had little choice.

Direct Line blamed a surge in the cost of vehicle repairs and weather-related claims for the fact that it will report an underwriting loss in respect of 2022 - which has forced it to scrap its full-year dividend.

At the time, shares of other general insurers also fell, with investors assuming its woes would afflict the rest of the industry. Subsequent trading updates from rivals have pointed to problems specific to the FTSE-250 member.

The two departures, while unrelated, underline a bigger issue, though, which is that the last year or so has seen a huge turnover among chief executives of top companies.

Research by Russ Mould, of the investment platform manager AJ Bell, shows that, during 2022, one in five FTSE 100 companies signalled a change of leadership, including Prudential, Burberry, Rolls-Royce, Shell, Reckitt and JD Sports.

All changed their chief executives last year while another clutch of blue chips, including Whitbread, Hargreaves Lansdown and Halma, announced the forthcoming departures of their CEOs during 2023.

Another was Unilever, the Magnum, Marmite and Persil giant, which announced last July that its chief executive, Alan Jope, would be departing this year.

The successor to Mr Jope, whose departure comes after the arrival of an activist investor on the shareholder register and disquiet about a failed approach for the consumer healthcare group Haleon, was named on Monday.

He is Hein Schumacher, currently head of Royal Friesland Campina, a Dutch dairy and nutrition co-operative with global operations, who previously ran the Asian operations of Heinz, which five years ago tried to buy Unilever.

How the pandemic has pushed executives from their jobs

Why the high turnover in chief executives?

One theory is that the pandemic has played a major role since, apart from 2022, only 2020 this century has seen a higher turnover of chief executives in the FTSE-100.

Running a business is stressful and hard work, as any SME owner will testify, at the best of times.

That was even more the case during the pandemic and particularly for big companies, like Rolls-Royce, for whom COVID-19 was an existential crisis.

It was no surprise that Warren East stepped down as chief executive of the aircraft engine maker once he and his colleagues had ensured its survival through a series of asset sales and emergency refinancing.

There will be some chief executives who leave due to personal circumstances. Often it is because they have been in the job for a long time and need a change of scene.

Alison Brittain, who shortly steps down at Whitbread, probably falls into that category having run the Premier Inn-to-Brewers Fayre combine for seven years.

So, too, does Pete Redfern, who stepped down at the housebuilder Taylor Wimpey last summer after 14 years at the helm.

And then there are others, like Ms James, whose departure is probably required by circumstances.

Robert MacLeod, who left the industrial materials and sustainable technologies group Johnson Matthey last year, is a good example here. Another is Nick Read, who left Vodafone just before Christmas after four years spent tidying up the mobile giant's sprawling portfolio of assets, but failing to convince investors of its growth prospects.

Timing is everything

What should be very clear from all of this is that the chief executive who can dictate the timing of their departure is blessed.

The late Richie Benaud, a distinguished former Australian cricket captain and later one of sport's most beloved commentators, once famously said: ""Captaincy is 90% luck and 10% skill - but don't try it without that 10%.""

The same can be said of being chief executive of a FTSE-100 company.

The typical Footsie company is a complex beast with a great many moving parts and, accordingly, potential for a great many things to go wrong.

The typical successful chief executive will obviously have got where they are with ability and hard work - but they also require a big dollop of luck: a benign economic backdrop, perhaps, or the unexpected collapse of a competitor. Some chief executives have that luck and others do not.

Sir Rod Eddington, at the helm of British Airways during the 9/11 terror attack and its aftermath, falls into the latter camp.

But that ""10% skill"" to which Benaud was referring also reflects how some chief executives make their own luck through sheer determination.

Sir Nigel and the need for capitalism to be more inclusive

Sir Nigel, who grew up on a council estate in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, is one such chief executive.

A man who competes at everything - Monday's stock exchange announcement of his departure noted that he ""has won several national masters athletics championships"" - he has skilfully navigated the life insurance company through a number of economic challenges, including Brexit and the pandemic, while growing its revenues and profits.

L&G; observed that its total shareholder return (the total return a shareholder receives and which includes capital gains, dividends or special distributions) since he joined the company was more than 600%, which puts him easily in the top quintile of boardroom performers during the period.

At the same time, he has been a strident advocate of pension funds investing more in long-term infrastructure to support regeneration, social mobility and the decarbonisation of the economy, something that saw him offered a ministerial role by Liz Truss (he declined).

These days, it is increasingly rare for a chief executive to talk about anything other than the performance of the business they lead.

But Sir Nigel, a Newcastle United supporter, was equally happy talking about the need for capitalism to be more inclusive and more attuned to supporting the life chances of those who lack capital.

He told Building Magazine in November last year: ""When I grew up, I grew up in Newton Aycliffe, which was a new town. I got to move into a new council house, a two-bedroom house, very different at the time - we were just so excited about it.

""I went to the local new school, with new teachers, new everything - and that really created a platform for the rest of my life. And that created an opportunity, and I would never have been here today if I had continued to live with my grandparents in a massively overcrowded house.

""We want people to have those opportunities today.""

British business could use a few more executives with such perspective.

It is to be hoped Sir Nigel will continue to raise such issues wherever his career next takes him.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130163220/http://news.sky.com/story/how-the-pandemic-has-meant-that-2022-has-seen-a-high-turnover-of-chief-executives-12799258

Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) looked at how increases in the cost of living and difficulties accessing NHS services have impacted people's lives.

After surveying thousands of households, the ONS found 18% of adults asked were eating smaller portions, and 18% eating food past its use-by date.

Those reporting moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms, those with diabetes, and those with children were more likely to be resorting to smaller portions or out of date food.

Around one in seven adults (15%) the ONS spoke to were also worried about running out of food before they had money to buy more.

The European Food Information Council advises that food should not be eaten past its use-by date, but you ""can eat food past its best-before date if it looks, smells and tastes fine"".

Jason Webb, managing director at Electronic Temperature Instruments - which manufactures digital thermometers for cooking - said: ""This again raises the issue of 'best-before dates' versus 'use-by dates'.

""'Best-before' products could be eaten for days, weeks, or even months beyond the date on the packaging depending on the food type and how it's been stored. It's important to remember that a 'use-by' date is the safety marker and is there to protect us.

""Food with a 'use-by' date should never be eaten after that date, so we should try to use or freeze these items before they expire.""

He added: ""Education is key to help people better understand what produce is safe to eat and when.""

The poll from the ONS asked people how they were impacted by winter pressures between 22 November and 18 December 2022.

It also found almost a quarter of adults (24%) reported they were occasionally, hardly ever, or never, able to keep comfortably warm.

Respondents experiencing moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms (44%) and people using pre-payment, or ""top-up"", meters for energy bills (41%) were more likely to report this.

Of those who ran out of food - and couldn't afford to buy more - more than two-thirds (70%) said they were less likely to keep comfortably warm.

NHS England's plans will see some children referred for same-day appointments with specialists instead of them having to go to A&E;, which is feeling the strain of long waiting times.

Clinicians will be able to help young people manage their illnesses at home or decide on another route for their care, with direct access for children and adults to mental health support being rolled out across the country.

People will be able to select the mental health option when they call up for help.

The health service said it is expecting an increased number of clinicians - including retired staff and returners - working across 111, which will be integrated into the NHS app to make it easier to use.

Family support workers are also being placed at some A&E; departments - one in every region - to provide support to children with non-urgent issues.

Meanwhile, more virtual wards will be offered to children to ease pressure on hospitals.

Sean Duggan, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation's mental health network, said the 111 expansion would be welcomed by health leaders ""as a vital front door for children and young people with mental health concerns to get the support they need"".

""Hopefully this will lead to earlier access to therapies and treatments, which in turn will reduce the number of people reaching a crisis state where they end up calling 999 or in A&Es; with nowhere else to go, or worse,"" he said.

The company said the layoffs, part of a plan to significantly reduce costs, would leave it with 800 employees globally.

It was yet to give details on where the bulk of the job losses would fall.

The bulk of its teams are in the UK and in Georgia - the latter destination a result of the company's decision to pull out of Russia because of the Ukraine war.

Arrival has struggled to grow because of persistent difficulties raising funds - with start-ups generally finding it more difficult to secure supplies and meet heightened costs.

Funding troubles accounted for Britishvolt earlier this month.

Arrival had previously revealed that it was to shift its focus away from its UK operations, which include state of the art production and development facilities in Oxfordshire, to take advantage of sweeteners being offered by the US government.

Incentives for green energy initiatives, available to both businesses and the public, under the Inflation Reduction Act have placed western governments and the European Union (EU) under huge pressure to follow suit or lose green investment.

The EU, for example, argues that the $369bn (£298bn) package of subsidies break World Trade Organisation rules on the grounds that the act would discriminate against imported goods.

While public road trials in the UK of its first certified and registered vans have begun, and are continuing, Arrival expects its US Van product will start production in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2024.

That, however, remains dependent on the raising of additional capital.

Arrival said it had appointed Teneo, a financial adviser, to assist in ""evaluating strategic alternatives, including opportunities to raise additional capital, optimise its balance sheet, and improve liquidity.""

The company added: ""When combined with other cost reductions in real estate and third-party spending, the company expects to halve the ongoing cash cost of operating the business to approximately $30m per quarter.

The company also appointed Igor Torgov, who joined in February 2020, as its chief executive officer.

He said of the task ahead: ""Arrival has developed unique technologies in a market that has huge growth potential and can play a key role in addressing climate change.

""To unlock these opportunities, we need to make difficult decisions and to take swift action.

""Following a detailed evaluation of Arrival and the wider EV market during the past two months, the leadership team and the board have taken decisive action to ensure the most effective use of our current resources and optimise the efficiency of the business.

""The actions support our journey to become a champion in innovative products and new, more efficient methods of vehicle production, particularly in the important US market for commercial electric vehicles.

Strong's death was confirmed by the Motown Museum in a series of tweets paying tribute to his prolific career.

""Barrett was not only a great singer and piano player, but he, along with his writing partner Norman Whitfield, created an incredible body of work,"" Motown founder Berry Gordy said in a statement. No further details have been released.

Strong was the pianist and lead singer on Motown Records' breakthrough hit Money (That's What I Want), released early in 1960 and later covered by artists including The Beatles and the Rolling Stones.

It came less than a year after he agreed to let his friend Gordy - then in the early days of building his recording empire in Detroit - manage him and release his music.

While he never again approached the success of Money on his own - and the song ironically led to arguments over money as he fought for acknowledgement as a co-writer - with Whitfield he formed a productive and eclectic songwriting team.

Amy Winehouse to Bruce Springsteen - the artists who covered Strong's work

I Heard It Through The Grapevine was first recorded by Gladys Knight And The Pips in 1966, and Marvin Gaye's release two years later became one of the label's biggest sellers of all time. The track has been covered numerous times, by everyone from Creedence Clearwater Revival to Amy Winehouse, and also charted again in the 1980s thanks to being featured in the famous Levi's Launderette advert.

The Barrett-Whitfield partnership also wrote Cloud Nine and Psychedelic Shack for The Temptations, as well as the protest anthem War - with its famous refrain: ""War! What is it good for? Absolutely... nothing!"" - for Edwin Starr.

You talk about these things with your families when you're sitting at home, and it inspires you to say something about it.""

His other hits with Whitfield, who died in 2008, included I Can't Get Next To You, That's The Way Love Is, and the Grammy-winning chart-topper Papa Was A Rollin' Stone.

Artists who covered their songs ranged from The Rolling Stones (Just My Imagination) and Aretha Franklin (I Wish It Would Rain) to Bruce Springsteen (War) and Al Green (I Can't Get Next to You).

Strong was born in West Point, Mississippi, and moved to Detroit a few years later.

He was a self-taught musician who learned piano without needing lessons and, with his sisters, formed a local gospel group called the Strong Singers.

In his teens, he got to know such artists as Franklin, Smokey Robinson and Gordy, who was impressed with his writing and piano playing.

'Songs outlive people'

Strong spent part of the 1960s recording for other labels, and left Motown again in the early 1970s and made a handful of solo albums, including Stronghold and Love Is You. In 2004, he was voted into the Songwriters Hall Of Fame, which cited him as ""a pivotal figure in Motown's formative years"".

The music of Strong and other Motown writers was later featured in the Broadway hit Ain't Too Proud: The Life And Times Of The Temptations.

According to BMI (Broadcast Music Inc), there are more than 240 songs in his back-catalogue.

""Songs outlive people,"" Strong told The New York Times in 2013. ""The real reason Motown worked was the publishing. The records were just a vehicle to get the songs out there to the public.

""The real money is in the publishing, and if you have publishing, then hang on to it. That's what it's all about. If you give it away, you're giving away your life, your legacy. Once you're gone, those songs will still be playing.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130163220/http://news.sky.com/story/barrett-strong-i-heard-it-through-the-grapevine-writer-and-motowns-first-star-dies-aged-81-12799283

Friends say Kyle Smaine, 31, was among five foreign skiers caught up in the huge snow flow while on Hakuba Norikura mountain, near the Tsugaike ski resort, on Sunday.

He was there visiting the country to promote winter tourism in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, according to outdoor magazine, Mountain Gazette.

Another man, said to be from Austria, also died in the avalanche, while three other skiers managed to get down the mountain on their own, police said.

Officers have so far declined to confirm any details about the two men.

However, two friends have since named Smaine, who won the gold medal in the halfpipe event at the FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships in 2015, as one of the men to have died.

One friend, fellow US skier Adam U, was with Smaine when the avalanche happened.

He told Mountain Gazette: ""We heard the crack. We realised it is a big one. We started running and then we got hit.""

'Worst nightmare scenario'

Another friend, photographer Grant Gunderson, who was with the group shortly before the avalanche, described it as ""my absolute worst nightmare scenario"".

In an Instagram post, he said: ""It was supposed to be the last day of the trip so we were just out for a mellow tour to freeski, as we had one of the best days ever skiing and shooting the day before.

""I was exhausted from the last 10 days so after that run I skied down to the base lodge. Kyle and Adam chose to go back up and ski it again.""

Image: Police officers at the scene

He said there was then an avalanche which ""stepped down into a massive avalanche on an adjacent slope. The slope that they had now done two runs on didn't slide"".

""Adam, Kyle and the other skier tried to run. Adam was buried 1.5m deep for 25 minutes and is unscathed. That is a miracle.

""The skier buried next to him died from internal injuries. Kyle was thrown 50m by the air blast and buried and killed.""

He added: ""Adam and I will be rehashing this for the rest of our lives.""

Around 30% of Ukraine is covered in landmines and explosives, and failing to remove them could spark a ""domino effect"" in Europe and Africa, a Ukrainian deputy has said.

In a speech to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Lesia Vasylenko said the devices are now spread over areas of farmland and woodland as well as cities, towns and villages.

""Recently de-occupied areas are the areas which pose the most risks to the livelihood of humans,"" she said.

""Men, women and especially children are admitted every day with wounds from explosives.""

She added that the problem of demining Ukraine is now a global issue, and if equipment is not procured and personnel are not trained, fields will not be ready for farmers to plant their crops in spring.

""This will lead to a domino effect of massive, massive problems, extending far beyond the territory of Ukraine, far beyond the territory of Europe, but over to Africa and the Middle East, and boomeranging back into Europe,"" Ms Vasylenko said.

Pressed on the US general's comments in the Commons, defence minister James Heappey replied: ""I think everybody is clear.

Asked about the US general's private comments on Monday, the prime minister's official spokesman said ""yes"" to Mr Sunak believing that the British Army is a top-level fighting force.

He said the government is ""ensuring our armed forces have the equipment and capability they need to meet the threats of tomorrow including through a fully funded £242bn ten-year equipment plan"".

""The prime minister is clear that we have to do everything necessary to protect our people that's why the UK has the largest defence budget in Europe,"" the spokesman added.

Mr Sunak has yet to make any meaningful pledge to expand his defence coffers, instead pursuing a ""refresh"" of a review of defence policy that is due to be published on 7 March ahead of a spring budget that will signal whether there is any new money for the military.

972;Teachers' strike to go ahead after education secretary 'squandered the opportunity' to avoid action, union says;Monday 30 January 2023 16:14, UK;[];['strikes'];['ahead', 'union', 'planned', 'squandered', 'avoid', 'secretary', 'opportunity', 'strike', 'education', 'action', 'talks', 'neu', 'pay', 'teachers'];"Talks between the education secretary and the teaching unions have failed and the biggest teachers' strike in years will go ahead.

Last-minute talks were held by Education Secretary Gillian Keegan on Monday in a bid to resolve a teachers' pay dispute ahead of planned strikes this week.

Members of the National Education Union (NEU) in England and Wales will now walk out on Wednesday, with more industrial action planned in the following weeks.

The strike on Wednesday is expected to encompass up to half-a-million workers with teachers due to be joined by train drivers, civil servants, university lecturers, bus drivers and security guards from seven trade unions in what will be the biggest day of industrial action in over a decade.

The NEU has announced seven days of strikes in England and Wales in February and March, with the walkout on Wednesday expected to affect over 23,000 schools.

Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, joint general secretaries of the NEU, said: ""Gillian Keegan has squandered an opportunity to avoid strike action on Wednesday.

""The government has been unwilling to seriously engage with the causes of strike action.

""Real-terms pay cuts and cuts in pay relativities are leading to a recruitment and retention crisis with which the Education Secretary so far seems incapable of getting a grip.

""Training targets are routinely missed, year on year. This is having consequences for learning, with disruption every day to children's education.""

In a separate comment, Mr Courtney said: ""I regret to say that we didn't hear anything that enables us to say that the strike shouldn't go ahead on Wednesday.

""There's no offer from the secretary of state trying to bridge the gap between us.""

Meanwhile, a headteachers' union boss has described the talks with Ms Keegan as ""deeply disappointing"".

Following the meeting with the education secretary, Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""Parents will have been looking for the government to avert the planned strike on Wednesday.

""Instead, the government continues to talk around the issues rather than putting anything on the table which allows for any meaningful negotiation.

""It is deeply disappointing.""

Mr Barton added: ""We are sorry to report that there is therefore no resolution to the dispute and the strike is set to go ahead.""

The teachers' strike was confirmed shortly before British firefighters voted to carry out nationwide action in a dispute over pay.

About 88% of members of the Fire Brigades Union had voted in favour of strike action, on a 73% turnout, the union said.

Its members had rejected a 5% pay offer in November.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130163220/http://news.sky.com/story/teachers-strike-to-go-ahead-after-education-secretary-squandered-the-opportunity-to-avoid-action-union-says-12799333
973;Rising public support for unions despite widespread strikes, Sky News poll suggests;Monday 30 January 2023 17:00, UK;['gurpreet narwan', '@gurpreetnarwan'];['strikes'];['workers', 'sky', 'widespread', 'sector', 'support', 'unions', 'nurses', 'suggests', 'poll', 'despite', 'strike', 'action', 'public', 'pay', 'rising', 'strikes'];"Support for trade unions is rising even though strike action is bringing public services to a standstill , Sky News polling shows.

Industrial relations are at their most fractious since the 1980s, with the country having lost more than a million working days to strikes last year.

Despite this, sympathy for striking public sector workers has risen over the past couple of months.

Exclusive polling commissioned by Sky News shows that the public increasingly think that trade unions play a positive role in society.

A survey of more than 2,000 adults found that 37% support unions, up from 35% in November.

A smaller proportion - 28% - said unions play a negative role in society, down from 34% in November.

The findings suggest that the government, which is refusing to deliver inflation-matched pay rises, may not be able to rely on waning support for strike action.

Support for unions has increased as the wave of strike action has spread from the transport and communication sectors to the NHS.

Ambulance workers, nurses and doctors have all either voted for or announced intentions to ballot for strike action since the last polling.

YouGov data shows that NHS workers elicit the strongest support from the public.

As many as 43% of respondents to the survey said they strongly support strike action by nurses, while another 22% said they somewhat support it.

Only 31% said they strongly or somewhat oppose industrial action from nurses.

Like many public sector workers, nurses have experienced a decade of real-term pay cuts.

When inflation is taken into account, nurses' pay fell by 7.76% between 2011 and 2020. The most recent pay deal, announced last summer, also lagged behind inflation.

It is a similar story across the public sector, with the pay gap between the public and private sector widening.

In the three months to October, average private sector pay growth, excluding bonuses, was running at 6.9%.

The figure for the public sector was just 2.7%. Meanwhile inflation was running at close to 11%.

The Sky News poll indicates robust support for industrial action but the public is uneasy about how readily unions can go on strike.

At a time when the government is pushing through legislation that will make it harder for unions to call strikes, 33% of respondents said that they were able to take action too easily and that more restrictions should be placed upon them.

This was down slightly from 34% in November.

By comparison, 22% of respondents said that unions should be given more freedom, up from 20% in November.

Laura Winham's remains were found by her brother in her flat in Woking, Surrey, in May 2021, after she died in November 2017.

A pre-inquest review at Surrey Coroner's Court heard the county council failed to follow up on police concerns.

Kate O'Raghallaigh, representing the Winham family at the review, said Surrey police officers visited the woman's flat when she was still alive in October 2017.

She said the police reported concerns, that she had been neglecting herself and had little access to food, to Surrey County Council.

""There was a risk to Laura of malnutrition and self-neglect in October 2017 when she was observed by police,"" Ms O'Raghallaigh said.

But the council failed to follow up on these concerns, the hearing was told.

The inquest heard that the exact date of death is unknown - a calendar in Ms Winham's flat had dates crossed off until November 2017.

Her body was found in May 2021 - three-and-a-half years after her death - when Ms Winham's family said they asked police to break into her home after they grew concerned for her safety.

A cause of death has yet to be determined, which Ms O'Raghallaigh described as a ""very unusual factor in this case"".

Katie Ayers, representing the county council, said the authority accepts a care assessment for Ms Winham should have been done after the police visit.

""What Surrey County Council has accepted is that a section nine check should have been completed but it was not,"" she said.

Ms Ayers added: ""There may have been a risk in relation to malnutrition. At this stage that would seem to be speculative.""

Ms O'Raghallaigh asked assistant coroner Dr Karen Henderson to engage a forensic anthropologist to investigate whether Ms Winham's death was caused by malnutrition and establish a window of time in which she may have died.

Dr Henderson said she will provide a written decision on the matter in the coming weeks.

She scheduled another pre-inquest review for 15 March and set a provisional full hearing date for 3 April.

The review previously heard that Ms Winham was found in a ""mummified almost skeletal state"".

He said the government is ""ensuring our armed forces have the equipment and capability they need to meet the threats of tomorrow including through a fully funded £242bn 10-year equipment plan"".

Earlier today, Conservative defence committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said people should be ""very concerned"" about the armed forces' current capabilities.

981;Surprise drone attack on Iran was work of Israeli intelligence, US officials say;Monday 30 January 2023 17:49, UK;['dominic waghorn', '@dominicwaghorn'];['iran', 'israel', 'ukraine'];['intelligence', 'say', 'surprise', 'israeli', 'iran', 'officials', 'israels', 'russia', 'iranian', 'work', 'attack', 'military', 'operation', 'drone'];"A drone attack that caused a large explosion in the Iranian city of Isfahan was the work of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, according to US officials.

In a daring operation, Israeli agents appear to have launched the attack from within Iran.

A US intelligence official said on Sunday that Israel was behind the attack but the Israeli military declined to comment.

Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder confirmed no US forces had been involved but also declined to comment further.

But an Israeli intelligence expert says there are signs the strike was an Israeli operation.

Israeli intelligence analyst Ronen Bergman told Sky News: ""The use of quadcopters is a very well-known stamp of Israeli intelligence and a source of concern for the Iranian regime because the short range of the drone means they were launched from inside Iran, highlighting Mossad's capabilities.""

Mr Bergman is a pre-eminent authority on Mossad and author of Rise and Kill First, the Secret History of Israel's Targeted Assassinations.

It is not clear how much damage was done by the drone attack.

Iran claims to have foiled the raid by shooting the drones down but Mr Bergman says Israel regards the operation to have been a success.

It has not been confirmed what was attacked, but footage shot by a witness in Isfahan shows a large blast at a military factory in the city.

The city is a centre of research and development for Iran's missile technology.

'Ukraine did warn you'

Israeli sources say the attack was unrelated to drone shipments to Russia.

Iran has been supplying Russia with cheap drones used to devastating effect on largely civilian targets in Ukraine.

Ukrainian government adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted: ""Explosive night in Iran, Ukraine did warn you.""

Iran has summoned Ukraine's ambassador over the tweet.

Separately the Russian foreign ministry issued a statement condemning ""any provocative actions potentially capable of provoking an uncontrolled escalation of tension in an already far from calm region"".

The attack is the first known use of force inside Iran to be carried out by Israel under its new far-right coalition government led by Benjamin Netanyahu.

But it suggests he is prepared to continue the hawkish policies of his predecessor Naftali Bennett who advocated a new ""Octopus Doctrine"" to deal with Iran.

Instead of striking at the Iranian regime's many ""tentacles"" in the region, it advocates striking at its head.

Mossad appears to have developed a significant presence inside Iran if it can carry out short range drone attacks on secret Iranian military sites with apparent impunity.

Israel has been reluctant to directly help Ukraine in a military sense, even though Russia is using weapons supplied by Israel's enemies in Iran.

Israel does not want to alienate Russia and lose Russian permission to fly military sorties over Syria.

But this latest operation will please Kyiv if it has dented Iran's missile capability.

It comes after Sky News yesterday revealed a US general privately told Mr Wallace that the UK's armed forces are no longer regarded as a top-level fighting force.

Defence sources revealed the US general said this decline in war-fighting capability needed to be reversed faster than planned in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine.

US criticism of UK military 'will be music to Putin's ears' - Ukraine war latest

They told Sky News' defence and security editor Deborah Haynes this should include increasing the defence budget by at least £3bn a year and halting a plan to shrink the size of the army further.

Mr Wallace agreed on the need for ""urgent recapitalisation"", but said the government was already investing £34bn into the army's equipment plan between now and 2033.

""The criticism of 'it needs to happen now' is these things don't 'happen now',"" he said. ""There's no magic wand, there's no factories whirring away like car factories where you just press buttons and they come.

""There are only about two countries on the earth that can sustain almost constant production lines - that's China and the United States. Of course we can seek to buy from abroad, but then there won't be a UK defence and aerospace industry and we won't be able to necessarily give our troops the exact equipment they want, so we always have to make that balance.""

Mr Wallace also said countries across Europe were facing ""challenges"" with their supply chains, adding: ""That is what that new money is going towards and that's why it is important to send a signal to industry to say we are investing - that's what we did with the defence command paper in 2020 and we will continue to do so.""

983;Firefighters and teachers to strike over pay as public sector walkouts continue;Monday 30 January 2023 18:37, UK;[];['cost of living', 'strikes'];['continue', 'union', 'sector', 'unions', 'secretary', 'firefighters', 'strike', 'action', 'public', 'education', 'pay', 'teachers', 'walkouts', 'strikes'];"Teachers and firefighters are the latest public sector workers to announce they will go on strike in disputes over pay.

The biggest teachers' strike in years will go ahead after unions said the education secretary ""squandered the opportunity"" to avoid action - while firefighters have voted overwhelmingly to walkout after experiencing what their union says is a 12% drop in real-terms earnings.

The latest strikes have been announced as Sky News polling suggests support for trade unions is rising, even though walkouts are bringing public services to a standstill.

The teachers' strike comes after last-minute talks were held by Education Secretary Gillian Keegan on Monday in a bid to resolve the pay dispute before planned strikes this week.

Members of the National Education Union (NEU) in England and Wales will now walk out on Wednesday, with more industrial action planned in the following weeks.

Wednesday's strike is expected to include up to half a million workers, with teachers due to be joined by train drivers, civil servants, university lecturers, bus drivers and security guards from seven trade unions in what will be the biggest day of industrial action in more than a decade.

Government 'squandered' chance to avoid strike by teachers

The NEU has announced seven days of strikes in England and Wales in February and March, with the walkout on Wednesday expected to affect over 23,000 schools.

Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, joint general secretaries of the NEU, said: ""Gillian Keegan has squandered an opportunity to avoid strike action on Wednesday.

""The government has been unwilling to seriously engage with the causes of strike action.

""Real-terms pay cuts and cuts in pay relativities are leading to a recruitment and retention crisis with which the education secretary so far seems incapable of getting a grip.

""Training targets are routinely missed, year on year. This is having consequences for learning, with disruption every day to children's education.""

Sunak says pay rise for nurses would make inflation worse

Meanwhile, a headteachers' union boss has described the talks with Ms Keegan as ""deeply disappointing"".

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""Parents will have been looking for the government to avert the planned strike on Wednesday.

""Instead, the government continues to talk around the issues rather than putting anything on the table which allows for any meaningful negotiation.""

Mr Barton added: ""We are sorry to report that there is therefore no resolution to the dispute and the strike is set to go ahead.""

Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said after talks failed: ""It is hugely disappointing the NEU is continuing with strike action. These strikes will have a significant impact on children's education, especially following the disruption of the past two years, and are creating huge uncertainly for parents.

""With talks ongoing on a range of issues, including around future pay, workload, behaviour and recruitment and retention, it is clear that strikes are not being used as a last resort.

""I have been clear today that unions do not need to strike to meet with me. I also reiterated my call to union leaders to ask their members to let headteachers know if they intend to strike, helping schools to minimise the impact on children.""

Firefighters likely to strike for first time in nearly 20 years

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:20 Firefighters vote for strike action

Firefighters also overwhelmingly backed strike action, with 88% voting yes on a 73% turnout, it was announced today.

The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it has given the government and employers 10 days to to come up with an improved offer which could be put to a vote of members in an effort to avoid strikes.

The last time there was a nationwide walkout by firefighters was in 2003.

Firefighters have experienced a 12% drop in real-terms earnings since 2010, the union says, while around one in five firefighter jobs have been cut in the same period.

It comes after members rejected an offer of a 5% pay increase in November, which unions argued was below-inflation and would be felt as a real-terms cut by workers.

The FBU argued polling has previously shown there is strong public support for strike action by firefighters, with around three in five people backing action.

FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: ""This is an absolute last resort for our members. The responsibility for any disruption to services lies squarely with fire service employers and government ministers.

""Rishi Sunak's government has refused to make funding available for a decent pay offer to firefighters and control staff.

""Firefighters were among Britain's COVID heroes who kept frontline services going during the pandemic. The prime minister has badly misjudged the public mood by imposing pay cuts on key workers.""

The strike announcement comes after research by the FBU and the University of Central Lancashire found firefighters are more likely to die of cancer than the general public.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130184749/http://news.sky.com/story/firefighters-and-teachers-to-strike-over-pay-as-public-sector-walkouts-continue-12799333

The star, who is best known for her portrayal of Vesper Lynd in the James Bond film Casino Royale with Daniel Craig, was due to play the lead role in A Patriot, but the production was abandoned in October 2019.

Green, 42, is suing White Lantern Films and SMC Speciality Finance for the $1 million (about £808,000) fee she says is still owed, despite its cancellation.

Image: Green is best known for starring alongside Daniel Craig in the James Bond film Casino Royale

White Lantern is bringing a counterclaim against the French actress, alleging she undermined the independent film's production, made ""excessive creative and financial demands"", and had expectations that were ""incompatible"" with the film's low budget.

The producers have cited WhatsApp messages from Green in which she described one producer as a ""f****** moron"" who should be fired and another as ""evil"". She also allegedly described funders for the movie as ""a*seholes"" and some proposed crew members as ""sh*tty peasants"". The actress addressed these messages later in her evidence.

Entering the witness box at the High Court on Monday, the third day of the hearing, Green first told how making quality productions was her ""religion"" and said abandoning A Patriot would have been like abandoning her ""baby"".

In her written evidence to the court, Green said she ""fell in love"" with the film, in which she was cast as soldier Kate Jones, after reading writer and director Dan Pringle's ""brave and daring"" script.

""I believed and still do that the film had the capacity to really wake people up and help them to see that the devastation of our world would eventually trigger resource wars and massive migration,"" she said in the statement.

Green added in court: ""As I have said repeatedly, I fell deeply in love with this project - not only the role, but also the message of the film.

""I couldn't imagine abandoning the film, as it would have been like abandoning my baby. It still feels that way.""

Producers say Green had 'animosity'

Green said the script for the film was ""one of the best scripts I have ever read"" and that she was excited to play the role of a soldier, which she had never done before. She cited the film being about climate change as an issue ""dear to my heart and important"".

The actress also discussed some of her other work, telling the court: ""I don't care about the money. I live to make good films, it's my religion.""

Max Mallin, representing White Lantern, previously claimed Green had an ""animosity"" towards a vision for the film held by one of its executive producers, Jake Seal.

The barrister said that in exchanges on WhatsApp with her agent and the film's director, Green claimed Seal was planning to make a ""cheap B movie"" and described him as ""the devil"" and ""evil"".

Mr Mallin asked Green if she remembered sending a different text message, suggesting the film under Mr Seal would be a ""B-sh*tty-movie""; she said she did.

Green told the court: ""I never wanted this to be a B-movie but I realised more towards the end that it was going to happen.""

She continued: ""I had several opportunities to walk away from this project but at the time I felt like I had an armour, the strong crew members around me.

""I thought we had these strange producers but a strong crew so we could still make something good quality, but I was probably naive.""

The move from Ireland

In her witness statement, Green said her initial confidence in the film dwindled following delays and its move from Ireland to a studio outside London, and that she felt she had been ""deceived"".

Denying allegations that she was not prepared to go ahead with the film, she said: ""In the 20 years that I have been making films, I have never broken a contract or even missed one day of shooting.

""Nor have I been late or done anything but give 100% heart, body and soul to every project I have ever been involved in.""

She added: ""Why on earth would I sabotage a project that I loved and that I risked my reputation on? It makes no sense at all.""

'Nothing against peasants'

Green also apologised for ""inappropriate language"" and ""some horrible things"" expressed by her in emails and texts in August and September 2019.

She said one message was an ""emotional response"" after finding out she had been ""lied to"" about the move from Ireland.

The actress also told the High Court she has ""nothing against peasants"" when questioned about the word being used in one of her messages.

""I have nothing against peasants, I didn't want to work with a sub-standard crew,"" she said. ""I wanted to work with a high-quality crew who just wanted to be paid standard industry rates.""

A Patriot was also due to feature Game Of Thrones star Charles Dance and Twister star Helen Hunt, with Oscar winner Kathy Bates attached too at one point.

Green is due to finish giving evidence on Tuesday and a ruling on the case is expected at a later date.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130184749/http://news.sky.com/story/eva-green-gives-evidence-at-high-court-in-lawsuit-over-collapsed-film-saying-she-fell-deeply-in-love-with-the-project-12799358

""If you're very exposed and everyone knows intricate details about your personal life, it just gets a little bit harder. Some air of mystery might be a good thing with actors.""

The Irish actor's comments come as he takes to the stage in the play Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons on London's West End.

He stars alongside former Doctor Who companion Jenna Coleman in the Sam Steiner play.

The play is set against a new law that introduces a daily limit of 140 words per person - inspired by Twitter's old character limit.

The relationship between the two main characters becomes strained as they face the challenge of where in their lives to use the daily allocation of words.

""Sometimes it's a good thing that maybe they don't have enough words for the fight that they're probably about to have and other times you can see the frustration that they can't articulate exactly what they want to say,"" Turner said.

But one area of his private life he is willing to open up about is his sleepless nights as a new father.

He welcomed his first child in January 2022 with his wife, American actress Caitlin Fitzgerald.

""Some days [and] nights are easier than others, but you just get on with it,"" he said, adding that ""caffeine"" was his best friend.

Dublin-born Turner also said he is enjoying the satisfaction of telling a story in full with every nightly performance.

""When you do film or TV things, you tell a tiny bit of the story every day. You might do two or three or four pages of dialogue but obviously with the show, you tell the entire story from start to finish every single night and you get to feel that with the audience.""

990;What is the current state of the British armed forces?;Monday 30 January 2023 19:08, UK;[];[];['armed', 'state', 'budget', 'decrease', 'forces', 'figures', 'current', 'seen', 'defence', 'spending', 'gdp', 'equipment', 'uk', 'british'];"UK defence spending as a proportion of GDP has halved since the 1980s - leading to a decline in equipment and a drop of one in six military personnel, Sky News analysis has revealed.

It comes after US defence sources warned cuts to the British Army meant it was no longer a top-level fighting force.

Sky News revealed on Sunday that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace had been told of the US concerns.

Defence minister James Heappey told the Commons he understood Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt know the army is ""in urgent need of recapitalisation"" and ""there is a budget coming"".

So what has happened to UK defence spending?

In 2021, the UK spent 2.2% of its Gross Domestic Product on defence, amounting to about £45.9bn.

However, this number has fallen since the mid-1950s. In the financial year ending in 1956, the UK spent just under 8% of its GDP on defence and in 1980 it was 4.1%. Since 2000, the proportion has remained around the 2% mark.

In comparison, health spending as a proportion of GDP in 1956 was just under 3% and in 2020 this figure jumped to over 7%.

Defence spending has remained consistent over recent years because of the government's pledge, as a NATO member, to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence each year.

Military expenditure compared with other countries

The UK is only one of a handful of countries to have consistently met this NATO benchmark.

The UK has the third-highest average defence spending as a fraction of GDP, behind just the US and Greece.

Also, Greece only hits this 2% target because the money is predominantly spent on salaries and pensions.

However, this could change as many countries are taking measures to increase their defence spending.

Last year, the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, pledged a one-off special fund of €100bn (£82bn) to bolster Germany's defences and to invest 2% of its GDP on defence going forward.

For context, in 2021 Germany's GDP was $4.26trn and 2% of this is $85.2bn.

Personnel and equipment

The UK has also maintained the NATO standard of allocating at least 20% of its defence budget on equipment.

Over a quarter (28%) of the UK's defence budget was spent on equipment in 2022, according to NATO estimates.

However, several types of equipment types have seen a decrease in recent years, according to data from the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

Armoured fighting vehicles, like tanks, have seen a decrease of 5% from 2016 to 2022 and artillery has seen a decrease of 2%.

Fixed winged aircraft that are in service have seen a decrease of 10%, and in-service rotary winged platforms, such as helicopters, have seen a decrease of 24% in the same time period.

While British defence spending has been maintained over a substantial amount of time, personnel numbers in the armed forces have been on the decline for years.

Conservative defence committee chairman Tobias Ellwood told Sky News that ""we have become complacent. We need to invest to make sure we retain people, the good people that are there, but there are not enough of them and the equipment is now obsolete"".

Quarterly figures from the MoD show that in 2022 there are just over 145,000 regular armed forces personnel.

This represents a decrease of 14% from the figures of 169,150 10 years ago and personnel figures are set to decrease even further.

Back in November 2022, Ben Wallace told the parliament that the British Army would now be reduced to 73,000 by the middle of the decade. Latest figures show that the number of regular British Army personnel stood at 79,139.

Rising energy costs and inflation will affect the armed forces

The MoD was the only department on the receiving end of budget cuts at the government spending review in October 2021.

The ministry's most recent annual staff costs were just under £15bn and the ministry can expect calls, like other sectors, for larger pay increases to protect the real terms pay of members of the armed forces.

Rising global energy prices are also likely to put pressure on MoD spending with recent figures showing a spend of around £600m per year on energy and fuel.

Asked about the US general's private comments on Monday, the prime minister's official spokesman said the government is ""ensuring our armed forces have the equipment and capability they need to meet the threats of tomorrow including through a fully funded £242bn 10-year equipment plan"".

""The prime minister is clear that we have to do everything necessary to protect our people that's why the UK has the largest defence budget in Europe,"" the spokesman added.

Although police investigated and took away his gun at the time, Davison was not charged with assault in September 2020. Instead, a detective sergeant referred him to a restorative justice programme as an alternative to prosecution, and his weapon was later returned.

Davison reacted angrily when a teenager called him a ""fat c***"" and ran off, the court heard.

The 22-year-old responded with a burst of violence so extreme his blameless victim suffered injuries to his eyebrow, nose and lip.

CCTV of the incident in a Plymouth park showed Davison punching the boy at least five times, the inquest into the deaths of Davison's victims was told.

When a 15-year-old girl went to her friend's aid - as he lay on the floor not resisting the volley of blows - she was slapped by Davison.

Davison's legally held pump-action shotgun and certificate were seized by Devon and Cornwall Police following the attack but returned to him in July 2021.

In August 2021, Davison shot dead five people, including his mother Maxine, with his firearm.

The details of Davison assaulting two teenagers came out today at the inquest into the deaths of Davison's five victims.

Davison blamed innocent teenagers

Davison lashed out at a young boy and girl in Central Park, Plymouth, in September 2020.

Although the boy who shouted at him ran away, the inquest heard he took out his anger out on two of the teenager's friends - considering them ""guilty by association"".

Bridget Dolan KC, counsel to the inquest, said: ""The CCTV shows more than five punches to the young man, maybe between seven and nine.

""The boy was hit so hard there was a two-inch cut above his eyebrow, and bleeding to his nose, eyebrow and lip.""

The boy required superficial stitches to his eyebrow and the girl was left with no visible injuries.

Davison later handed himself into the police after a public appeal was made and CCTV images of a suspect were issued.

The parents of the boy wanted Davison charged but he was instead enrolled on the Pathfinder ""voluntary intervention programme"" - which the Devon and Cornwall Police website insists is not a ""soft option"" and can reduce reoffending.

'Shocked by the ferocity of the assault'

After being alerted by staff from the project, Davison's certificate and weapon were seized by firearms inquiry officer David Rees but later returned.

Mr Rees told the inquest: ""Having seen the CCTV last week I was quite shocked by the ferocity of the assault. I wish I had queried the decision-making process of the gatekeeper [the detective sergeant].

""I should have questioned it.""

The inquest has previously heard Davison was so angry following the incident he wanted to kill the teenagers and went home to get his shotgun.

This week, Kate will front the new awareness drive called Shaping Us, with the hope it'll revolutionise the way the UK thinks about supporting families and young children.

It's the next major step in her ongoing work to draw attention to the importance of a child's social and emotional development up to the age of five.

The princess was joined by the Prince of Wales at a pre-campaign launch event at BAFTA headquarters in central London.

Speaking at the event, she highlighted how a child's mental development ""rarely"" gets as much focus as our physical health.

She said: ""The campaign is fundamentally about shining a spotlight on the critical importance of early childhood and how it shapes the adults we become.

""During this time we lay the foundations and building blocks for life. And it is when we learn to understand ourselves, understand others and understand the world in which we live.

""This is why it is essential, to not only understand the unique importance of our earliest years, but to know what we can all do to help raise future generations of happy, healthy adults.""

During the launch, a short film was shown highlighting how babies and children develop in response to their earliest experiences.

For over a decade Kate has developed an interest in this area of work after hearing how issues in early childhood can often be a contributing factor to difficulties in later life including addiction and mental health.

It led to the Royal Foundation, the charitable arm of the Prince and Princess of Wales's work, setting up the Centre for Early Childhood.

Through the Shaping Us campaign, which will be a long term project, they're aiming to transform the issue from one of scientific interest to a topic that gets people talking, just as Prince William, Kate and Prince Harry worked to break down the stigma around mental health through their Heads Together campaign.

They're hoping a range of high-profile figures from the world of media, music, science and sports will help to spread the word of the campaign and reach a diverse audience.

The princess will be involved in a series of events and social media campaigns this week to try and push home the message that a child's development in those early years shouldn't just be a concern for parents but the whole of society can play a part in making sure they get the upbringing they deserve.

This campaign marks another new role for Kate after she took over as patron of the Rugby Football League and the Rugby Football Union from Prince Harry when he stood down as a working royal.

The princess is also now Colonel of the Irish Guards, a position previously held by Prince William since 2011.

The Shaping Us campaign also shows Kate continuing with work that is important to her after the recent controversy around the Royal Family sparked by the release of Prince Harry's memoir Spare.

994;Jacob Rees-Mogg attacks government's anti-strikes law as 'badly written bill';Monday 30 January 2023 20:49, UK;['jennifer scott', '@nifs'];['jacob rees-mogg'];['badly', 'house', 'mr', 'bill', 'law', 'antistrikes', 'governments', 'mp', 'think', 'saying', 'legislation', 'right', 'jacob', 'written', 'attacks', 'public', 'reesmogg'];"Jacob Rees-Mogg has attacked the government over its anti-strikes legislation, calling the bill ""badly written"" and ""an extreme example of bad practice"".

The former business secretary was speaking in the Commons as MPs debated the proposed new law, which would see minimum service levels set for fire, ambulance and rail services for when the sectors decide to take industrial action.

The government has insisted the legislation - being tabled at a time of widespread action across the public sector - hits the right balance between the right to strike and ensuring public safety during walkouts.

But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to repeal the bill if his party comes to power, saying it is ""likely to make a bad situation worse"".

And the public is increasingly inclined to support strike action, especially in the NHS, according to exclusive polling for Sky News.

While Mr Rees-Mogg said he was a ""supporter"" of the proposed law's aims, he added ""it is a badly written bill"" - criticising a lack of detail when instead it should ""set out clearly what it is trying to achieve"".

The Conservative MP for North East Somerset said: ""This is almost so skeletal that you wonder if bits of the bones have been stolen away by wild animals and taken and buried somewhere, as if, you know, in cartoons.""

He backed Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, over her criticism of so-called Henry VIII clauses in the bill - allowing ministers to change it without the full scrutiny of Parliament - saying such measures ""should be used exceptionally"", or it was ""bad parliamentary and constitutional practice"".

And he agreed with the SNP's David Linden who questioned the need to rush the law through, saying: ""This isn't emergency legislation. This is a piece of legislation that we have been conjugating about in the Conservatives since at least our last manifesto, if not back to 2016.

""I have supported it all the way through, I have wanted this bill to come forward, I think it is the right thing to be doing, but there is no excuse for failing to do it properly.""

'Shirking responsibility'

Mr Rees-Mogg - who held cabinet positions under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, but returned to the backbenches when Rishi Sunak took charge - also warned the holes in the bill left it more open to challenges in the courts.

""If this House passes good, well-constructed legislation, it is much less susceptible to judicial review,"" he added. ""So there is a Treasury bench interest in good, well-crafted legislation... which this is not.""

Yet, despite his raft of criticism, the MP promised to back the plan and send it on to the House of Lords for further scrutiny, appealing to them to make the changes it needed.

Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell agreed with Mr Rees-Mogg's initial arguments, but claimed he was ""shirking the responsibility"" by voting it through.

""What we have seen in recent history, recent months, is actually the government withdraw a bill for further consideration until they get it right,"" he added.

""Surely that's the mechanism, otherwise we are shirking our responsibility to get this bill right.""

But Mr Rees-Mogg replied: ""I think he attributes to me more influence than I have.

""I think my fusillade against this particular clause of the bill will not change many votes this evening, including not my own as it happens, and therefore it is not going to be the case that the government is going to be defeated in this House.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230130213556/https://news.sky.com/story/jacob-rees-mogg-attacks-governments-anti-strikes-law-as-badly-written-bill-12799445

The pair, aged 28 and 40, who are from the Huyton area of the city, were also held on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent, said Merseyside Police.

A 25-year-old man, from St Helens, has also been arrested and taken to a police station for questioning on suspicion of assisting an offender.

All three men have previously been detained as part of the investigation. The total number of people arrested in connection with Ms Dale's death is 15.

Ms Dale, 28, was found with a gunshot wound in the back garden of her home just after midnight on Sunday 21 August last year.

She was treated by emergency services at the scene in Old Swan and then taken to hospital but died a short time later. She is not believed to have been the intended target of the killing.

At her funeral, Ms Dale was described by her family as a ""rising star"" who ""had her whole life ahead of her"".

Before her death, she had been promoted within the environmental health department at Knowsley Council.

""None of this makes sense and our lives will never be the same again. A senseless crime that has torn a family apart,"" the family said.

The Memphis Fire Department said it had fired two emergency medical technicians and an emergency vehicle driver after an investigation found they failed to provide adequate medical care.

Mr Nichols was left in critical condition after several officers punched, kicked and hit him with a baton in Memphis, Tennessee after he was pulled over on suspicion of reckless driving on 7 January.

The 29-year-old died three days later from his injuries.

The fire department said in a statement that Robert Long and JaMicheal Sandridge failed to conduct an ""adequate patient assessment"" of Mr Nichols.

It added that the pair, alongside Lieutenant Michelle Whitaker who drove the two paramedics to the scene and remained in her vehicle after arriving, were dismissed for violating department policy.

Five Black police officers have been fired and charged with second-degree murder and other crimes over Mr Nichols' death.

The five officers chatted and milled about for several minutes as the father-of-one remained on the ground, but there were other authorities on the scene.

Ian Baum sued Mr Thomas in the High Court for allegedly hiding his HIV status and ""failing to take reasonable care"" not to pass the virus on.

Mr Thomas, 48, will pay £75,000 plus costs but said he has not admitted liability by settling, adding that he maintains his innocence ""in all the meritless allegations"".

Mr Baum, a former police constable who was in a relationship with the retired rugby union star between 2013 and 2016, claimed he was HIV negative when they got together, court papers said.

The documents said Mr Baum noticed the former sportsman was taking pills from bottles which had the labels ripped off them but was told they were multi-vitamins.

He claimed he found out the pills were an HIV anti-viral medication called GSK1 after searching for them on Google.

Mr Baum said he ""immediately"" went to get a rapid HIV test and was ""devastated"" and ""went into shock"" when he found out he was positive.

'Unpleasant chapter'

The court papers said: ""By transmitting HIV to the claimant, the defendant has caused him serious physical and psychological injury.

""That information, had it become publicly known, would have been extremely damaging to the defendant's public reputation as a person who had spoken out about his homosexuality and LGBTQ issues.

""Since that time the defendant has portrayed himself as a spokesperson for LGBT issues without ever revealing that he deceptively transmitted HIV to the claimant in 2014.

""The defendant knowingly lied to the claimant about his HIV status and had coerced the claimant into having unprotected sexual intercourse when he knew that by doing so he was putting the claimant at risk of contracting HIV.""

McCue Jury and Partners, the legal firm representing Mr Baum, said in a statement: ""Ian stood up for himself against the odds. Ian is looking forward to putting this unpleasant chapter of his life behind him.""

1000;Labour pushes for increase to neighbourhood policing as communities face '3,000 anti-social incidents a day';Monday 30 January 2023 22:30, UK;['jennifer scott', '@nifs'];['labour', 'police'];['officers', 'labour', 'antisocial', 'crime', 'incidents', 'pushes', 'communities', 'policing', 'face', 'secretary', 'behaviour', 'increase', 'day', 'streets', 'office', 'neighbourhood'];"Labour will push the government for an increase to the number of neighbourhood police officers on Tuesday, saying communities are facing 3,000 incidents of anti-social behaviour a day.

In an opposition day debate in the Commons, the party will point to the latest crime statistics from the ONS, which showed 1.1 million incidents of anti-social behaviour had been reported to the police in the year leading up to September 2022.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper will accuse the government of failing to invest in neighbourhood policing teams, saying it has ""left communities to fight crime and anti-social behaviour on their own"".

And she will call on ministers to increase local police numbers, including ringfencing a proportion of the Police Uplift Programme - the government plan to recruit 20,000 more officers by March - for neighbourhood teams.

The latest update from the Home Office shows 15,343 have been recruited so far, with two months to go to reach the target.

Home Secretary Suella Braverman has previously pledged the new officers would ""add to efforts to drive down invasive crimes like burglary and neighbourhood offences, return to common sense policing and make our communities feel safer and stronger"".

And the Home Office said £120m had been spent on initiatives such as improving street lighting and home security to cut neighbourhood crime as part of its Safer Streets Fund.

But according to Labour, 6,000 neighbourhood police officers have been cut since 2015, and the number of Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) dropped by more than 8,500 since 2010.

Meanwhile, crime figures show the overall charge rate for crime is 5.5% compared to 15.5% in 2015.

Ms Cooper will say: ""This Conservative government has decimated neighbourhood policing. Across the country, people just don't see police on their streets anymore, and feel less and less safe as a result.

""Meanwhile, for millions of people anti-social behaviour has become part of day-to-day life, ruining lives without consequence.""

The shadow home secretary will also outline Labour's plans for government - namely a £360m package of 13,000 additional neighbourhood officers and PCSOs paid for through a ""police efficiency programme"" to increase shared services and procurement.

""Labour is the party of law and order,"" she will add. ""The next Labour government will put policing back where it belongs, at the heart of communities.""

1001;UK economy to fare worse than any other country in developed world this year, IMF forecasts;Tuesday 31 January 2023 01:46, UK;['ed conway', '@edconwaysky'];['uk economy'];['worse', 'fare', 'grow', 'previously', 'developed', 'fund', 'imf', 'economy', 'world', 'country', 'forecasts', '06', 'uk', 'forecast'];"Britain's economic reputation has been dealt a further blow after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that this year the UK economy will fare worse than any other country in the developed world - including Russia.

In the latest update of its economic forecasts, the IMF said that it expected the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) to contract by 0.6% in 2023.

To add further humiliation for the chancellor and prime minister, even as Britain's outlook was downgraded, most other countries around the world saw their forecasts upgraded.

But the Fund said that while the broader global economy was doing better than expected, with inflation having peaked and investment beginning to turn around, the UK economy would face a downgrade ""reflecting tighter fiscal and monetary policies and financial conditions and still-high energy retail prices weighing on household budgets.""

The UK had previously been forecast to grow by 0.3% this year and 0.6% next year.

Now, said the Fund, it should expect -0.6% this year and 0.9% growth in 2024.

The comments are especially awkward for the Treasury, which has been criticised by some for its plans to raise taxes and reduce the budget deficit in coming years, resulting in an increase in costs for businesses and households, even as they continue to battle a cost of living crisis.

Up until recently, chancellor Jeremy Hunt had contextualised the UK's relatively weak growth by pointing to the fact that the IMF's recent forecasts projected that a third of countries were facing a recession.

However, the Fund has now upgraded its growth projections for Italy and Germany, with the result that both will now grow more than the UK in 2023.

Indeed, Britain's -0.6% GDP is the worst of any economy included in its latest forecast update, including Russia - which despite facing sanctions from most of the West is projected to grow by 0.3%.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:51 Why EY sees weaker 2023 outlook

Chancellor says UK 'not immune' from pressure

Mr Hunt said of the forecast: ""The governor of the Bank of England recently said that any UK recession this year is likely to be shallower than previously predicted, however these figures confirm we are not immune to the pressures hitting nearly all advanced economies.

""Short-term challenges should not obscure our long-term prospects - the UK outperformed many forecasts last year, and if we stick to our plan to halve inflation, the UK is still predicted to grow faster than Germany and Japan over the coming years.""

The IMF said it now expected the global economy to expand by 2.9% in 2023.

Although this is down from the 3.4% in 2022, it is nonetheless 0.2 percentage points faster than the Fund previously forecast in October.

It said: ""Adverse risks have moderated since the October 2022 [World Economic Outlook].

""On the upside, a stronger boost from pent-up demand in numerous economies or a faster fall in inflation are plausible.

""On the downside, severe health outcomes in China could hold back the recovery, Russia's war in Ukraine could escalate, and tighter global financing conditions could worsen debt distress.""

After China's decision to open up its economy and ditch its zero-COVID policy, the Fund upgraded its GDP projection from 4.4% to 5.2% this year.

It said the US would grow by 1.4%, rather than its previous projection of 1%.

1002;Why spectre of British military becoming a 'hollow force' is now a reality;Tuesday 31 January 2023 01:32, UK;['deborah haynes', '@haynesdeborah'];['ben wallace', 'ministry of defence', 'raf', 'rishi sunak', 'royal navy'];['hollow', 'armed', 'longer', 'army', 'forces', 'money', 'force', 'case', 'defence', 'reality', 'military', 'spectre', 'british'];"When considering national defence budgets, what matters is not simply how much is spent but what that money actually buys in terms of armed forces size and fighting strength.

The UK will typically bat off even the best-informed criticism of its eroding military prowess by trotting out lines on how Britain is the biggest European defence spender in NATO and - according to some measurements - has the fifth-largest defence budget in the world.

This may, for now, be true - though it won't be for much longer if no new cash is found for the military and Germany and France overtake - but it does not equate necessarily to value for money or to credible capability.

The Ministry of Defence has a dismal track record of procuring weapons and equipment, from aircraft carriers and fast jets to boots and lightbulbs, with billions of pounds spent and - at times very little to show for it, in particular when it comes to the army's armoured vehicles.

Countless attempts have been made to improve the process, with some successes.

There are examples of the military resisting the desire to chase an exquisite, bespoke piece of kit that will cost more and take longer to make over something that is not quite as gold-plated but works and can be delivered within the desired timeframe.

Yet it still takes around nine months simply for a business case to be approved by ministers and the Treasury - let alone implemented.

It means that the around £46bn annual budget does not go as far as it should, leaving the armed forces less capable.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:13 Is the British Army up to scratch?

At the same time, since the end of the Cold War, successive governments have chosen to cut the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force and divert money into other priorities, such as health, welfare and paying down the national debt.

This has often led to already chaotic equipment programmes being delayed to save cash in the short term - only for the cost of the project to increase over the longer run, or for the whole thing to be cancelled.

It has also meant that the size and strength of the armed forces have shrunk.

What is the current state of the British armed forces?

British Army has 'fallen behind' and 'needs investment'

Yet the UK, as a nuclear-armed power, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a member of the G7 and a leading state in NATO, has attempted to avoid reducing its global ambitions to project power and influence.

This worked in the initial years after 1991 as Britain's military was shrinking from a position of significant mass and firepower.

But for the past decade, the spectre of what defence experts call the ""hollow force"" - a military that lacks the manpower, weapons, training and stockpiles to be effective - has loomed large and is now a reality.

It will be a surprise to no one inside defence that a senior US general has told Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, that the British Army is no longer regarded as a tier one force and is barely tier two, alongside the likes of Germany, Italy and Belgium.

What Prime Minister Rishi Sunak needs to decide is whether he is comfortable with that, in which case he must reduce his ambitions for the UK's role in the world, including in Ukraine.

Or whether he wants to retain his country's position of relative strength, able to defend itself and its allies. In which case, he will need to spend more on defence immediately before attempting over time to secure better value for money from the expanded budget.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131015533/http://news.sky.com/story/why-spectre-of-british-military-becoming-a-hollow-force-is-now-a-reality-12799558

One Home identified 21 at-risk villages and hamlets and estimated how much coast could be lost there.

Coastal erosion is the process by which land is worn away or displaced along the shoreline, through the repetitive motion of the waves, rocks smashing against land or chemical reactions in the water.

The value of property damage on land that could be hit by coastal erosion by 2100 was estimated at £584m, using average local authority values or site-specific values from Rightmove, One Home said.

It compiled a map highlighting what shoreline management plans are in place in different areas of the coast, and what the level of protection is.

It shows the coastal communities most at risk are:

• Cornwall

• Cumbria

• Dorset

• East Yorkshire

• Essex

• The Isle of Wight

• Kent

• Northumberland

• Norfolk

• Sussex

Angela Terry, chief executive of One Home, said: ""Sea levels are rising as global temperatures soar and so larger waves batter our coast during severe storms.

Dame Rachel de Souza said the consumption of pornography is ""widespread"" among children and highlighted harmful effects, including the belief among many young people that girls ""expect"" physical aggression in sex.

The report published on Tuesday found that 47% of young people aged between 16 and 21 believe that girls ""expect"" physical aggression in sex.

Dame Rachel warned that ""depictions of sexual coercion and aggression are commonplace"" in online pornography as she warned that the Online Safety Bill must pass through parliament as an ""urgent priority"".

The report's findings - from a survey of 1,000 young people aged between 16 and 21 in England - include:

• Most young adults (79%) aged 18 to 21 had seen pornography involving sexual violence by the age of 18

• Many young people assume that girls expect or enjoy sex involving physical aggression, such as airway restriction and slapping

• Almost half (47%) of respondents aged between 18 and 21 said they had experienced a violent sex act

• More than a third of young adults said they had sought out violent pornography involving at least one act of sexual violence

The report's also suggested that Twitter is the platform where the highest percentage of children had seen pornography (41%), followed by dedicated pornography sites (37%) and then Instagram (33%).

Dame Rachel said she was ""deeply concerned about the normalisation of sexual violence in online pornography"" and how it impacts children's understanding of sex and relationships.

She recalled an incident where she was told by a girl who had a first kiss with her 12-year-old boyfriend that he had ""strangled her"" having seen it in pornography ""and thought it normal"".

We're above the village of Battir, south of Jerusalem, on rocky land that has been farmed by generations of the same Palestinian families over decades.

They didn't create this road. It was bulldozed one evening by an Israeli settler living nearby. In the weeks that followed, he moved sheep on to the land, built a pen for them, and then dug a hole out the side of the hill.

We're with Hasan, one of the villagers who has fought to reclaim this land through Israeli courts.

""He (the settler) was just over there, and he started expanding all over this hilltop.

""He brought some kind of big containers on wheels and he created like a big camp, with electricity generators and so on, and bringing all the facilities of water tanks and stuff like that.""

Every evening, men from Battir come up here to keep watch on a rota. Within minutes of us arriving, a spotter saw the car lights and raised the alarm.

Hasan said: ""His (the settler's) claim was a grazing permit to come just to graze his sheep in the area. Then he starts saying this is the promised land of Israel and this is the land of the state of Israel, and I have the right to be here.

""But he never showed any evidence of land ownership or a contract that he got through any legal body.""

Image: Every night, men from Battir take it in turns to keep watch and try to stop Israeli settlers

Hasan and his fellow villagers have been threatened and on one occasion had tear gas fired at them by Israeli security when they tried to stand their ground.

""There were over a hundred settlers coming all together. We were really worried that it will become like a violent reaction. The third time he came in March or in February 2022, it was the most dangerous one when he came with some support of soldiers with him.

""They start shooting tear gas on us to prevent us from even getting closer from the hilltop over there. So we learn that this is getting violent. We are not looking to lose somebody from our village or our brothers or our cousins.""



It is a story you hear regularly in the West Bank. Israeli settlement expansion is illegal under international law and opposed by the US, UK, EU and the UN. It is the source of extreme anger for many Palestinians.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has flown in at a ""pivotal moment"" as the security situation here grows ever more volatile by the day.

He met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Monday and will sit down with Palestinian leaders in Ramallah on Tuesday.

Although the US still talks of a two-state solution, as do other international governments, it is a non-starter right now.

Mr Netanyahu is facing international pressure to calm the tensions, whilst at the same time beholden to extreme right-wing voices in his new cabinet.

In response to recent terror attacks in Jerusalem, the government has said it wants to arm more Israeli civilians and there has already been talk of introducing the death penalty.

The future for Hasan, and other Palestinians, is concerning.

Hasan said: ""Unfortunately, this is a very dangerous situation. We are really worried about all the support that the settlers are gaining through the new government.

""We are really worried they will come and they will attack us with their weapons, and we will not be allowed to be here anymore.""

What do you want? I ask him.

""I want to live in peace. I want to live in freedom. I want freedom because freedom will get us peace and justice. Without the freedom, we will never get peace and justice in this country.

1011;Germany made 'painful choices' in clearing village to make way for coal mine, climate envoy says;Tuesday 31 January 2023 07:47, UK;['victoria seabrook', '@seabrookclimate'];['cop28', 'germany', 'climate change'];['clearing', 'choices', 'energy', 'sky', 'morgan', 'germany', 'fossil', 'climate', 'crisis', 'oil', 'moving', 'way', 'envoy', 'coal', 'village', 'painful'];"Germany had to make ""painful choices"" when it evicted people from a village to make way for the expansion of a coal mine, its climate envoy has told Sky News.

Footage of German riot police in Lutzerath clashing with protesters against the nearby Garzweiler coal mine made headlines worldwide.

It was a decision some found incongruous with Germany's ambition to be a global climate leader.

Jennifer Morgan, state secretary and special envoy for international climate action, said: ""These are the very challenging societal debates that one has to have if you're serious about moving forward on the climate crisis.

""Are there tough choices and painful choices that come along the way? Absolutely.""

Ms Morgan pointed to the other ways Germany had scrambled to ensure the lights stayed on as Russian President Vladimir Putin squeezed Europe's gas supplies.

This included phasing out all Russian fossil fuels imports ""in a very short period of time,"" shifting to 80% renewables by 2030 and helping cut energy use by 60% in industry and 14% by households, she said.

Ms Morgan added: ""I would hope that one sees that as the direction that Germany is moving in, that there are very difficult political compromises that get made,"" she said, referencing the fact the coal-intensive North Rhine-Westphalia region had also brought forward its coal end date.

But she admitted Germany was ""vulnerable"" to the recent energy security crisis and that it had ""learned the hard way that one shouldn't be so dependent on fossil fuels or on one country"".

The campaigner-turned-diplomat, who was once head of Greenpeace International, also hinted at some sympathy with the Lutzerath activists.

She called it ""incredibly important in a climate crisis"" that young people can engage ""in an act of political debate about their future"".

'Rebalance fossil fuel interests'

In an interview in the German ambassador's residence in London, Ms Morgan said ""there needs to be a rebalancing"" of fossil fuel influence at the annual United Nations COP climate summits.

Last week, 450 green groups wrote to the UN to request a crackdown, after 630 lobbyists registered to attend COP27 in Egypt last year.

Their concerns were amplified after United Arab Emirates, one of the world's largest oil producers and host of COP28 this December, appointed an oil executive and government to run the talks.

Ms Morgan said the world must ""respect who the country has put forward"" and that Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, like any COP president, would have to ""take on a role that is actually above what they currently do in their day jobs"".

Campaigners have called for Mr Al Jaber to resign from his role as head of the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation, but Ms Morgan declined to say whether she would raise this with him when she meets him in February.

Asked if Germany, a long time sceptic of nuclear power, should reconsider the clean energy form, she said: ""Definitely not"".

""Nuclear has massive risks on its own, it's extremely expensive and it takes a long time to build,"" she added.

Ms Morgan, who was in London for talks with government ministers Lord Zac Goldsmith and Graham Stewart, said it would be ""safer"" for the UK - which is planning vast nuclear power expansion - to steer clear.

""Going further in offshore wind, as the UK has been doing, and building it out domestically, also on land, going for energy efficiency - I think that's a safer way to go,"" she said.

Ms Morgan, who represents one of the world's largest emitters and economies, also spoke about what keeps her awake at night.

""That we're moving too slowly,"" she said. ""That the pace and scale of change isn't fast enough, and that we have to do so many things at once.

""How do we get everyone to act as if it is the crisis that it is?""

In a court filing, Elvis Presley's ex-wife disputes an amendment to Lisa Marie's living trust that would see Priscilla replaced as an overseer of her daughter's estate.

A living trust is a form of estate planning that allows a person to control their assets while alive, but have them distributed if they die, and can serve the function of a will if a separate will is not filed.

Lisa Marie, the only child of Elvis and Priscilla, died on 12 January aged 54. She has been laid to rest at her father's Graceland mansion in Memphis, Tennessee.

Priscilla Presley's lawyers argue that there were ""many issues surrounding the authenticity and validity"" of the amendment to the will.

They are said to include a misspelling of Priscilla's name in a document allegedly signed by her daughter and the failure to notify her of the change.

Another issue was a signature by Lisa Marie that was ""inconsistent with her usual and customary signature"", lawyers said.

The court filing in Los Angeles noted that Priscilla Presley and former business manager Barry Siegel had been placed in charge of the living trust in 1993 and reaffirmed in 2010.

It also said that Priscilla Presley discovered a document existed pertaining to be an amendment to the trust dated 11 March 2016.

It said the ""purported"" amendment replaced her and Mr Siegel as both current and successor trustees, naming Lisa Marie's children Riley Keough and Benjamin Keough ""as successor co-trustees of the trust"" upon their mother's death.

The filing states that Mr Siegel had already intended to resign from his position, which would have left Priscilla Presley and Ms Keough as co-trustees.

Benjamin Keough took his own life in 2020 aged 27. His sister Riley, 33, is an actress.

1013;Mr Blobby costume buyer 'backs out of £62,000 bid';Tuesday 31 January 2023 05:53, UK;[];[];['item', 'mr', 'sold', 'level', 'backs', '62000', 'party', 'tv', 'buyer', 'costume', 'noels', 'blobby', 'bid', 'seller'];"The buyer of an original Mr Blobby costume - who was set to pay £62,000 for the item - has reportedly backed out of the sale.

An eBay auction for the piece of TV memorabilia, which is more than 25 years old, attracted huge interest last week.

The costume sold for £62,101 but it has now emerged the buyer pulled out of the sale within an hour of placing the large bid.

The anonymous seller told the BBC: ""I thought it would get to a level of £100 perhaps - and so I was shocked really that it reached the level it did.

""I think it was one of those things that was driven by social media.

""Ironically, it was being sold not to make money but to make space.""

The Mr Blobby suit was made by the BBC's costume supplier and was due to be used for Noel's House Party but the TV show was cancelled before it could be delivered.

Running from 1991 to 1999, Noel's House Party was a BAFTA-winning light entertainment show.

Earlier, the seller said the costume was in need of a new home after they claimed that neither the broadcaster nor the BBC's production team wanted it.

The costume needed some attention due to its age, with one of the plastic eyes cracked.

A Russian court has jailed a man for 12 years for attempting to burn down a military enlistment office in Siberia - in a ruling that classified his crime as an ""act of terrorism"".

The decision by a military court in Yekaterinburg was the first time the terrorism designation had been used to punish someone for an arson attack on an enlistment office, the TASS state-run news agency said.

Vladislav Borisenko, who was accused of trying to burn down a building in the Siberian city of Nizhnevartovsk in May, was sentenced to 12 years.

Part of his sentence will be spent in prison, and the rest in a maximum security prison colony.

TASS said the fire had spread across an area of one square kilometre, but that nobody had been hurt.

Mr Borisenko had carried out the attack with another man and they had both allegedly confessed their guilt, it said, saying they had purportedly acted on the promise of receiving a financial reward from a third party.

The court said in a statement that its ruling could be appealed.

1017;Why does the UK fare so poorly in the latest IMF forecast?;Tuesday 31 January 2023 10:04, UK;['ed conway', '@edconwaysky'];['uk economy'];['worse', 'fact', 'fare', 'economic', 'countries', 'imf', 'theres', 'latest', 'economy', 'poorly', 'world', 'forecasts', 'does', 'uk', 'forecast'];"Let's start with the provisos. There are a few reasons why the UK comes out of these latest International Monetary Fund forecasts especially badly.

The main one is that the previous IMF forecast, produced in October, didn't reflect the impact of the mini-budget. That partly explains why the UK got a downgrade when most other countries saw upgrades to their prospects.

Then there's the fact that the IMF seems to be taking a particularly pessimistic view on how quickly inflation will fall in the UK. This may or may not be right but it certainly paints the UK in a worse light than most of its peers.

Read more:

UK economy to fare worse than any other country in developed world this year, IMF forecasts

Minister dismisses International Monetary Fund's warning of sharp contraction for UK economy as 'wrong'

But neither of these provisos will be of much comfort in the Treasury. As recently as a few weeks ago it was able to justify the country's weak economic performance by pointing to October's IMF forecasts, which showed that a third of the world's economies were facing a recession and that the UK, weak as it was, would end up somewhere in the middle of the pack of industrialised economies.

Now, the story is far more stark.

Britain is an outlier - the only major country to see its economy contract this year, the only nation with a recessionary forecast.

The fact that even Russia, which is facing the full might of Western sanctions, not to mention a brain drain as its citizens abandon ship, is slated to do better this year and next is doubly humiliating.

It's possible, as I wrote above, that the IMF has got things wrong.

It's also certainly the case that things are looking a touch better here than they were only a few months ago. Contrary to the Bank of England's forecasts, the UK is not yet in recession (two successive quarters of economic contraction).

Other countries bouncing back faster

The problem is that other countries seem to be bouncing back far faster than this one.

This seems to come back to a few issues. The IMF points to the fact that Britain is especially sensitive to high gas prices (largely because we still heat most of our homes with it).

It points to the fact that a large chunk of the workforce left the labour market during the pandemic and hasn't come back.

But there's another, deeper issue.

While other countries around the world (most notably the US) are pouring billions of dollars of investment into their green energy industries, the Sunak government has just slashed public investment totals.

It is raising taxes into this slowdown, even as the Bank raises interest rates. That will exacerbate the cost of living crisis.

Then there's Brexit, the cause of further trade friction which is also depressing economic growth.

It is a toxic cocktail of factors, some unfortunate, some avoidable, which have landed the UK where it is today. The upshot is grisly forecasts like the one we've just seen from the IMF.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131113336/http://news.sky.com/story/why-does-the-uk-fare-so-poorly-in-the-latest-imf-forecast-12799691

Police say they are ""extremely concerned"" about Mark Gordon and Constance Marten, who went missing after their car broke down in Bolton on 5 January.

The previous night they dumped a pushchair in Spitalfields, east London.

Police say the couple could still be camping somewhere in the UK.

Ms Marten, 35, who is from a wealthy family with connections to the royals, has lived an isolated life with Mr Gordon, a 48-year-old convicted sex offender, since they met in 2016.

Director Antoine Fuqua and producer Graham King said Jaafar Jackson, whose father is Jermaine Jackson, had a natural ability to emulate his uncle and bring him to life.

The official Michael Jackson account tweeted: ""Have you heard the news? Michael's nephew, Jaafar, has been chosen to portray Michael in the upcoming biopic on the King of Pop!""

Lionsgate Studio said the biographical movie, called Michael, will explore ""the complicated man who became the King of Pop"".

The film will include ""all aspects"" of his life and his most noteworthy performances that set him on the path to becoming an icon in the musical world"", it said in a statement.

Lionsgate did not directly address one of the most controversial aspects of Jackson's story - his trial on child sex abuse charges in 2005 and additional allegations against the singer featured in the 2019 documentary, Leaving Neverland.

In 2005, Jackson was acquitted by a California jury in the sex abuse case involving a 13-year-old boy.

The 2019 documentary followed the accounts of Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who claimed they were befriended by Jackson and sexually abused by him from ages seven and 10, respectively, in the early 1990s.

Jackson died aged 50 on 25 June 2009 just as he was preparing for his This Is It comeback tour.

While the creators of the film looked far and wide for the right person for the role, it seems their answer was closer to home.

King was a producer on award-winning Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, which stars Rami Malek.

The counters and hot delis will close from 26 February, the retailer added, after ongoing reviews of the counters have taken place since 2019. But most hot counters and delis have already been removed from the majority of shops, it said.

All workers affected by the closures will be offered alternatives roles, it said, but it did not say how many staff work on counters and delis.

Hot and deli counters may not disappear entirely, Tesco said. ""Where we can work with a third party to offer a counter experience in-store, we will continue to do so.""

The changing management structures will impact around 1,750 workers as the number of lead and team managers in large shops will be reduced.

Tesco said those affected will have the option of moving into shift leader roles ""with financial support"" or taking redundancy.

An estimated 350 workers will be impacted by a series of localised changes, such as the closure of eight pharmacies and reduced hours at some in-store post offices, the store group added.

Providing more detail about the management staff affected, Tesco said in a statement: ""With the introduction of these new shift leader roles and realignment of management roles, we have taken the difficult decision to reduce the number of lead and team managers in our large stores, impacting around 1,750 colleagues.

1027;'Extra safeguards' coming after AI generator used to make celebrity voices read offensive messages;Tuesday 31 January 2023 11:39, UK;[];['artificial intelligence'];['deepfake', 'celebrity', 'reading', 'extra', 'voices', 'voice', 'generated', 'safeguards', 'tool', 'video', 'technology', 'used', 'clips', 'offensive', 'generator', 'read', 'messages', 'coming', 'ai'];"A voice technology company which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate realistic speech says it will introduce extra safeguards after its free tool was used to generate celebrity voices reading highly inappropriate statements.

ElevenLabs released a so-called voice cloning suite earlier this month.

It allows users to upload clips of someone speaking, which are used to generate an artificial voice.

This can then be applied to the firm's text-to-speech speech synthesis feature, which by default offers a list of characters with various accents that can read up to 2,500 characters of text at once.

It didn't take long for the internet at large to start experimenting with the technology, including on the infamous anonymous image board site 4chan, where generated clips included Harry Potter actress Emma Watson reading a passage from Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf.

Other files found by Sky News included what sounds like Joe Biden announcing that US troops will go into Ukraine, and a potty-mouthed David Attenborough boasting about a career in the Navy Seals.

Film director James Cameron, Top Gun star Tom Cruise, and podcaster Joe Rogan have been targeted, and there are also clips of fictional characters, often reading deeply offensive, racist, or misogynistic messages.

'Crazy weekend'

In a statement on Twitter, ElevenLabs - which was founded last year by ex-Google engineer Piotr Dabkowski and former Palantir strategist Mati Staniszewski - asked for feedback on how to prevent misuse of its technology.

""Crazy weekend - thank you to everyone for trying out our Beta platform,"" it said.

""While we see our tech being overwhelmingly applied to positive use, we also see an increasing number of voice cloning misuse cases. We want to reach out to Twitter community for thoughts and feedback!""

The company said that while it could ""trace back any generated audio"" to the user who made it, it also wanted to introduce ""additional safeguards"".

It suggested requiring additional account checks, such as asking for payment details or ID; verifying someone's copyright to the clips they upload; or dropping the tool altogether to manually verify each voice cloning request.

But as of Tuesday morning, the tool remained online in the same state.

The company's website suggests its technology could one day be used to give voice to articles, newsletters, books, educational material, video games, and films.

Sky News has contacted ElevenLabs for further comment.

Dangers of AI generated media

The deluge of inappropriate voice clips is a reminder of the perils of releasing AI tools into the public sphere without sufficient safeguards in place - previous examples include a Microsoft chatbot which had to be taken down after quickly being taught to say offensive things.

Earlier this month, researchers at the tech giant announced they had made a text-to-speech AI called VALL-E that could simulate a person's voice based on just three seconds of audio.

They said they would not be releasing the tool to the public because ""it may carry potential risks"", including people ""spoofing voice identification or impersonating a specific speaker"".

The technology presents many of the same challenges as deepfake videos, which have become increasingly widespread on the internet.

Last year, a deepfake video of Volodymyr Zelenskyy telling Ukrainians to ""lay down arms"" was shared online.

It came after the creator of a series of realistic Tom Cruise deepfakes, albeit more light-hearted clips purporting to show the actor doing magic tricks and playing golf, warned viewers about the technology's potential.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131113336/http://news.sky.com/story/extra-safeguards-coming-after-ai-generator-used-to-make-celebrity-voices-read-offensive-messages-12799703

Megan Baynes, cost of living reporter says:

Well, first of all - congratulations! Ryanair does allow you to change your flight date and route up to two-and-a-half hours before the plane is scheduled to depart.

But, unfortunately, you will likely have to pay a fee.

Online it will cost you £45 per passenger, per one-way flight (so £90 per return). If you call their reservation center, or try and change it at the airport, this will be £60 per passenger per one-way flight (so £120 a return).

Given flights with Ryanair - dependent on the destination - can be quite cheap, you could end up paying more to change the date than you did on your original flight.

It's worth checking your travel insurance if you took some out before you became pregnant, because this may cover the cost of cancelling and rebooking the flights. Each policy varies but give the insurance provider a call and they can talk you through it.

I've also had a look at the small print and - you might already know this - but for uncomplicated single pregnancies, Ryanair restricts travel beyond the end of the 36th week. For twins, triplets, and so on, it is beyond the end of the 32nd week.

However, complicating things further, Ryanair reserves the right to refuse travel to an expectant mother over 28 weeks pregnant and who does not have a 'fit to fly' certificate from a doctor or midwife so make sure you plan your holiday well in advance of these dates and have all the right papers -have a great holiday.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131113336/http://news.sky.com/story/cost-of-living-latest-tesco-hot-deli-shake-up-puts-thousands-of-jobs-at-risk-why-has-the-imf-downgraded-the-uk-12615118
1029;'Doppelganger murder': German woman accused of killing her lookalike in attempt to fake her own death;Tuesday 31 January 2023 10:55, UK;[];['germany'];['week', 'fake', 'victim', 'doppelganger', 'killing', 'women', 'death', 'k', 'sharaban', 'case', 'woman', 'lookalike', 'german', 'accused', 'murder', 'ingolstadt', 'attempt'];"A woman has been accused of seeking out a lookalike of herself on social media and murdering her in a bid to fake her own death.

Authorities say Sharaban K, a 23-year-old beautician of Iraqi descent from Munich, searched for women who resembled her closely online before killing one of them in order to go into hiding, German news outlets are reporting.

The case has been dubbed the ""doppelganger murder"", in reference to a German folktale about a ghostly identical spirit, but the word doppelganger also has come to mean a stranger who looks like a twin.

The suspect and others involved in the case are being referred to by their first names and last initials, as is customary in the German legal system.

Police first discovered a blood-covered body in August last year in a parked Mercedes in Ingolstadt, southern Germany.

Reports initially identified the victim as Sharaban K, but a post mortem examination raised questions about the body's identity.

The victim was eventually named as Khadidja O, a 23-year-old beauty blogger from the neighbouring state of Baden-Wurttemberg.

Police later stated the victim and Sharaban K were ""strikingly alike"" in appearance due to their physical similarities such as straight black hair.

On 19 August, officers detained Sharaban K and a friend accused of plotting the scheme.

The full extent of the case and their alleged motives were not publicly disclosed by authorities until this week, and it is has now emerged prosecutors believe Sharaban K planned to fake her own death due to a dispute with family.

""Investigations have led us to assume that the accused wanted to go into hiding because of a family dispute and fake her own death to that effect,"" Veronika Grieser, of the Ingolstadt state prosecutor's office, said in a statement.

Ms Grieser explained that investigations uncovered several attempts by Sharaban K to reach out to women on social media she resembled in the week before the alleged murder.

She is said to have operated under aliases and attempted to set up meetings with the women.

While many of these attempts proved unsuccessful, she eventually managed to set up a meeting with Khadidja O by making a ""cosmetics offer"", authorities allege.

Sharaban K and Sheqir K are accused of picking up the woman before taking her to a forested area between Heilbronn and Ingolstadt, before stabbing her to death.

Arrest warrants were issued for both women last week, and they each face life in prison if convicted.

Police spokesperson Andreas Aichele told the German tabloid newspaper Bild: ""The crime weapon has not been found, but the evidence is overwhelming. The victim was killed with over 50 thrusts of the knife, the face completely disfigured.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131113336/http://news.sky.com/story/doppelganger-murder-german-woman-accused-of-killing-her-lookalike-in-attempt-to-fake-her-own-death-12799704

Get Me Out Of Here! for the money.

He also defended the 3% of his £320,000 appearance fee which he donated to charity as a ""decent sum"".

The former health secretary said the £10,000 donation was ""more than my MPs' salary"" that he still received while appearing on the reality TV show in the Australian jungle.

Entering the show despite criticism from constituents and colleagues, Mr Hancock's team had told reporters he would be donating a portion of his appearance fee.

Ahead of his appearance, Mr Hancock said he signed up to raise awareness of dyslexia, which he was diagnosed with while at Oxford University.

Mr Hancock later revealed he had given a share of the £10,000 sum to the St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk and the British Dyslexia Association after official records showed his fee amounted to £320,000.

""I didn't primarily do it [go on the reality show] for the money, I primarily did it to try to show who I am,"" Mr Hancock told ITV's Good Morning Britain programme.

""I think £10,000 is actually a decent sum.""

He also confirmed he still received his MP salary while in the jungle, but said his donations were larger than that sum, which is around £7,000 per month.

The West Suffolk MP, who was kicked out of the Conservative Party over his appearance on the show, did concede that ""of course there was a discussion and negotiation over the fee"".

But he argued that he ""certainly would have considered"" appearing on the programme for just £10.

He also denied that negotiations about his fee soared after he turned down initial offers.

Mr Hancock finished in third place on the show behind actor Owen Warner and England professional footballer Jill Scott.

Records on the MPs' register of interests showed Mr Hancock received £320,000 from Lifted Entertainment, ITV Studios, for the work which he listed as lasting for 30 days.

The appearance was criticised by many MPs, including the prime minister.

More than 1,000 complaints were made to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom over his participation.

He also backed former PM Boris Johnson for keeping Priti Patel in place as home secretary despite her being found to have broken the ministerial code over bullying allegations.

Mr Rees-Mogg's comments were condemned by a civil service union chief.

Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, said: ""Even by Rees-Mogg's standards this is outrageous.

""Not only should he be ashamed of himself, but his leader and party should distance themselves from this.""

Adam Tolley KC is investigating the bullying allegations against Mr Raab, with reports suggesting at least 24 civil servants have raised complaints about his conduct.

The first claims against the deputy PM emerged in The Guardian and relate to his stint at the Ministry of Justice between September 2021 and September 2022 under Boris Johnson.

Around 15 senior civil servants in his private office had been offered ""respite or a route out"" after his return was announced, the newspaper said, due to concerns some were still traumatised from working for him.

Multiple MoJ sources also said he had previously created a ""culture of fear"" in the department, alleging he was ""very rude and aggressive"", adding: ""[He] wasn't just unprofessional, he was a bully.""

A spokesperson for the department said there was ""zero tolerance for bullying across the civil service"".

Hours later, a report in The Sun claimed he had thrown tomatoes from his salad at staff.

Another in The Mirror said he had been given the nickname ""The Incinerator"" because of how quickly he ""burns through"" employees.

A spokesman for the deputy PM dismissed the salad attack claim as ""complete nonsense"" and denied a high turnover of staff in his departments.

There have also been allegations about Mr Raab's behaviour when he was Brexit secretary in 2018 and during his time as foreign secretary, between July 2020 and September 2021.

Sky News has learnt that Britain's biggest supermarket chain is in advanced talks about buying Paperchase's name and other intellectual property through a pre-pack administration that could take place as early as Tuesday.

Sources close to the situation said Tesco was unlikely to be interested in any of Paperchase's stores, meaning that most of its workforce may face the prospect of losing their jobs.

It was unclear on Tuesday morning whether any other suitors were in talks about a deal.

Sky News revealed this week that the chain was on the brink of administration as hopes of a solvent rescue deal faded.

Begbies Traynor, the professional services firm, is lined up to handle the insolvency following a sale process run by PricewaterhouseCoopers over recent weeks.

Paperchase was put up for sale late last year, just four months after its most recent change of ownership.

The chain was taken over in August by Steve Curtis, an experienced retail investor who has been involved with Tie Rack and Jigsaw.

Retail Realisation, an industry advisory firm with which Mr Curtis and turnaround firm Rcapital are affiliated, was also involved in last summer's deal.

Paperchase had previously been one of many retail casualties of COVID-19, having undergone a pre-pack administration in January 2021.

Other notable high street chains to collapse during the pandemic included Debenhams and the Dorothy Perkins-to-TopShop empire, Arcadia Group.

It trades from about 100 stores, and Mr Curtis was said at the time of the most recent takeover to be backing an existing management plan to grow that number to approximately 150 in the coming years.

Permira Credit, the previous owner, had invested in Paperchase's digital offering as well as new shop openings and executive recruitment since its last brush with insolvency.

At that time, Paperchase employed nearly 1,300 people, and traded from more than 125 sites across the UK.

Its outlets included concessions at House of Fraser, Selfridges and a number of Next stores.

It comes after Ukrainian officials stepped up calls for allies to donate advanced warplanes so they can control their airspace.

They are currently using old Soviet-era jets.

There are concerns sending such technology could escalate the conflict and be viewed by Russia as NATO countries entering the war by proxy.

Speaking on Tuesday, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The UK's Typhoon and F-35 fighter jets are extremely sophisticated and take months to learn how to fly. Given that, we believe it is not practical to send those jets into Ukraine.

""We will continue to provide and accelerate our military support to Ukraine and listen carefully to their requests.

""It is the length of time it takes to learn how to use what are very complex pieces of equipment that is the limiting factor in this case but we will explore what more we can do to support Ukraine.""

On Monday, Britain's defence secretary had said he was keeping an open mind about joining any future coalition supplying jets.

Former prime minister Boris Johnson is currently in the US.

He is stateside as part of a push to maintain the West's support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion.

The ex-PM has been speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington DC, this afternoon.

Mr Johnson said there is ""no conceivable grounds for delay"" from Western countries - days after Germany was criticised by some for appearing slow to decide on providing tanks to Ukraine.

Western allies should ""give the Ukrainians the support they need to finish this war"", Mr Johnson said, adding: ""Let's give them those tools now.""

He added that if Ukraine is able to take back the strip of land in southern Ukraine between Mariupol, the Donbas and Crimea, this will help to end the war.



""If they can take back Melitopol and Berdiansk and Mariupol, get back those areas, it's game over for Putin,"" he said.

Returning to his arguments later in the discussion, he said it would be a ""false economy to let Putin win"".

This, he said, would be ""burdening future generations with the massive expense of trying to protect the whole area"".

We reported earlier on comments from Mr Johnson to Fox News in the US, with the former PM calling for Western leaders to send fighter jets to Ukraine.

Downing Street has said Mr Johnson's visit to Washington was ""not on behalf of the UK government"" and has distanced itself from the former leader's comments on fighter jets.

Mr Sunak's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister welcomes all colleagues' backing for Ukraine and is pleased the former prime minister is continuing his staunch support of the United Kingdom's efforts to help Ukraine secure a lasting peace.""

But he said Mr Johnson is ""acting in his own capacity"".

On the possibility of sending jets, the official said: ""It's currently not practical to send UK jets.

""We will continue to work closely with the Ukrainians to understand their needs and how allies can further support them.

""Given the complexity of UK fighter jets and the length of time required to train them, we do not currently think it is practical to do so.""

Downing Street said the RAF's Typhoons and F-35s are ""extremely sophisticated"" pieces of equipment.

1035;Police promise to admit mistakes and not 'defend the indefensible' after Hillsborough report recommendations;Tuesday 31 January 2023 13:43, UK;[];['hillsborough'];['hillsborough', 'disaster', 'bereaved', 'ensure', 'admit', 'law', 'indefensible', 'response', 'promise', 'families', 'report', 'defend', 'reforms', 'recommendations', 'tragedy', 'mistakes'];"Police chiefs have promised to acknowledge mistakes and not ""defend the indefensible"" as they set out long-awaited reforms in the wake of a report into the Hillsborough disaster.

Among the changes are a Charter For Families Bereaved Through Public Tragedy, which commits police leaders to acknowledge any mistakes and ensure ""care, compassion, openness, transparency and accountability"".

All forces in England and Wales have signed up to the pledge.

The police response on the day of the 1989 stadium crush - as well as after it - has long been an open wound for families of the 97 dead and those who survived.

A 2016 inquest jury ruled the fans were unlawfully killed amid a number of police errors.

""Police failures were the main cause of the tragedy and have continued to blight the lives of family members ever since,"" said Chief Constable Andy Marsh, head of the College of Policing.

""Descriptions of how the bereaved were treated by police officers in the immediate aftermath of the disaster make harrowing reading..."" adds the introduction to today's report.

""When compassion and leadership were most needed, the bereaved were often treated insensitively and the response lacked coordination and oversight.""

The reforms are in reply to the former bishop of Liverpool, James Jones, who made formal recommendations for ensuring the suffering of Hillsborough families is not repeated.

They were published five years ago, but the national police response couldn't be made public until legal proceedings and other matters were over.

Today's report says Hillsborough must be ""the touchstone for more ethical police leadership"" - and as such candour will become a key theme of the police's updated code of ethics.

A supporting code of practice - which senior police must follow - will also set out ""a responsibility to ensure openness and candour within their force"".

'Deeply sorry'

Other reforms include new national guidance for the family liaison officers - the point of contact with relatives when somebody is involved in a tragedy such as Hillsborough.

Findings from the 2017 report, as well as tragedies like Grenfell Tower, have been fed into the latest best practice.

A new code of practice on police information and records management is also being implemented after records relating to Hillsborough were lost or destroyed.

Senior police repeated their apologies for the disaster as they published their response on Tuesday.

Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), said he was ""deeply sorry for the tragic loss of life, and for the pain and suffering that the families of the 97 victims experienced on that day and in the many years that have followed"".

He said they were now committed to responding to major incidents with ""openness and with compassion for the families"" above any other interest.

""Collectively, the changes made since the Hillsborough disaster and in response to Rt Reverend James Jones's report aim to ensure the terrible police failures made on the day and in the aftermath can never happen again.""

'Promises must become law'

The former bishop said he welcomed the police response and its acknowledgment that the treatment of families was ""harrowing"".

He also welcomed the NPCC's new ""duty of candour"" and its view that bereaved families should have as much legal representation as public bodies after a tragedy.

He said the government must now make these two principles legally binding as ""Hillsborough Law"".

The government has yet to formally respond to the 2017 report - something a survivors' group says is stopping families from being able to move on.

Chairman of the Hillsborough Survivors' Support Alliance, Peter Scarfe, also called the five-year wait for a police response ""way too long"".

He said the police reforms should be put into law to make a real difference.

""It's not quite Hillsborough Law - I would expect Hillsborough Law to be passed,"" he said.

""It's easy saying we've learnt from it, we're going to correct our mistakes, we'll make sure accountability is there, we can't cover things up - but without a law they can.""

The prime minister's official spokesman said part of the delay in responding to James Jones's report had been to avoid the risk of prejudicing criminal cases.

""The government has been working closely with the relevant departments and organisations to carefully consider and address the points directed at government,"" the spokesman said.

""That's alongside the work with the police, because there are elements that span both government and policing.""

He said there was no specific date for a response as ""it's important to ensure we do this properly"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131121452/http://news.sky.com/story/police-promise-to-admit-mistakes-and-not-defend-the-indefensible-after-hillsborough-report-recommendations-12799806
1036;Thousands of ambulance workers in England to strike on 10 February over ongoing pay dispute;Tuesday 31 January 2023 13:37, UK;['sophie morris', '@itssophiemorris'];['strikes'];['workers', 'nhs', 'union', 'england', 'ongoing', 'unions', 'strike', 'action', 'ministers', 'ambulance', 'thousands', 'pay', 'dispute', 'strikes'];"Thousands of ambulance workers in England will strike on 10 February, Unison has announced.

The union said workers across five services will walk out as the long-running dispute over pay and staffing continues.

Ambulance workers in London, Yorkshire, the South West, North East and North West will be involved in the industrial action.

Strikes will now be happening across the NHS every day next week apart from Wednesday.

'Toxic cocktail' behind dire economy forecast - politics latest

Downing Street said the latest strike action by ambulance workers is ""deeply concerning"".

""We are putting in place significant mitigations that have previously helped reduce some of the impact from these strikes,"" the PM's official spokesperson said.

""But first and foremost we would ask the unions to reconsider that approach and continue discussions.""

Announcing the latest industrial action, Unison urged ministers to stop ""pretending the strikes will simply go away"" and improve ambulance workers' pay.

The union also warned that unless the government has a ""major rethink"" over NHS pay, and gets involved in ""actual talks"" with unions, it will announce strike dates running into March.

It added that by then, the dispute is likely to affect double the number of trusts and extend to the whole of the ambulance service in England.

""The government must stop playing games. Rishi Sunak wants the public to believe ministers are doing all they can to resolve the dispute. They're not,"" the union's head of health Sara Gorton said.

""There are no pay talks, and the prime minister must stop trying to hoodwink the public. It's time for some honesty. Ministers are doing precisely nothing to end the dispute.

""The government's tactics seem to be to dig in, wait months for the pay review body report and hope the dispute goes away. It won't. And in the meantime, staff will carry on quitting, and patients being let down.

""There can be no health service without the staff to run it. Ministers must open proper talks to end the dispute and put in place the urgent retention plan needed to boost pay and staffing across the NHS.""

The latest strike announcement comes as ministers are braced for the biggest day of industrial action in over a decade on Wednesday when teachers, university lecturers, train drivers, civil servants, bus drivers and security guards stop work on the same day.

The PM's spokesperson conceded that Wednesday's mass strike action will be ""very difficult"".

Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) voted overwhelmingly in favour of action in a ballot result announced on Monday.

The FBU has said it is giving the government and employers 10 days to make an improved offer before deciding its next move.

If they go ahead, the strikes will be the first nationwide fire strikes over pay since 2003.

As Russia cut off gas supplies to Europe last year, countries including the UK, Germany and Italy put more coal power on standby to fill the gaps, raising feared of increased greenhouse gas emissions from the most polluting fossil fuel.

But the bloc fended off a feared dramatic increase in burning coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, which is globally being phased down in a bid to curb climate change.

Instead, wind and solar generated a record fifth (22%) of electricity in the EU in 2022, overtaking gas for the first time (20%).

Ember, the green think tank that completed the analysis, celebrated the achievement amid a ""triple crisis in the electricity sector"".

As Europe raced to cut ties with its biggest supplier of fossil gas, Russia, it also grappled with the lowest levels of hydropower for at least 20 years amid a severe drought.

At times, half of France's vast nuclear power fleet were offline due to ongoing defects or a backlog of maintenance issues.

Coal power share did rise by 1.5 percentage points to generate 16% of electricity, but it amounted to only ""a minor ripple in coal power and a huge wave of support for renewables"", said Ember's head of data insights, Dave Jon

""Any fears of a coal rebound are now dead,"" he added.

Lower electricity demand also helped reduce the energy deficit, dropping by 7.9% in the last quarter of 2022 compared to the same period the previous year.

Mild weather was a significant factor, but concerns about costs, improved energy efficiency measures and ""citizens acting in solidarity to cut energy demand in a time of crisis"" likely also helped, Mr Ember said.

However, the EU remains one of the world's largest emitters of climate-heating greenhouse gases, and its climate targets, policies, and finance are rated ""insufficient"" by the authoritative Climate Action Tracker.

Elif Gunduzyeli, Senior Energy Policy Expert at CAN Europe, said it should ""should not take a fossil gas crisis to hit"" to grasp that demand reduction and increased wind and solar ""can replace fossil fuels in the electricity sector"".

Alexandru Mustata, coal campaigner at Europe Beyond Coal, warned that ""countries like Bulgaria and Romania are trying to use the moment to construct a narrative that coal has a future.

1044;Andrea Riseborough: Why a British star's Oscar nomination has sparked controversy;Tuesday 31 January 2023 13:11, UK;['gemma peplow', '@gemmapeplow'];['andrea riseborough', 'oscars'];['oscar', 'controversy', 'riseboroughs', 'andrea', 'academy', 'actress', 'oscars', 'leslie', 'riseborough', 'nomination', 'film', 'stars', 'campaign', 'sparked', 'awards', 'british'];"When British actress Andrea Riseborough's name was read out as one of this year's five Academy Award nominees for best actress, it came as something of a surprise to many.

Not because her performance in To Leslie - a small indie film in which she plays a single mother who turns to alcoholism after winning the lottery - wasn't worthy, but because there had been no substantial awards-season buzz surrounding her before the announcement.

This is how it works: the Oscars is the biggest night in Hollywood, the culmination of awards season, but it's not the only ceremony in Tinseltown.

Many will no doubt be aware of some of the events, such as the Golden Globes, while others including the SAG awards are less well known. And of course, there is also the BAFTAs in the UK.

Each awards ceremony has its own members voting but you tend to see the same names cropping up on the shortlists, give or take a few.

In 2022, for example, Will Smith, Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose and Troy Kotsur picked up the four acting prizes at pretty much every single ceremony, including, finally, the Oscars.

Riseborough, who starred in Roald Dahl's Matilda The Musical in 2022 and is also known for The Kindness Of Strangers, Made In Dagenham and Birdman, did not receive nominations for any other awards this year, and nor did To Leslie.

However, before the Oscar nominees were announced, Riseborough did publicly receive the backing of some very prominent A-listers (more on this later).

During awards season, film studios campaign, campaign, campaign - which means projects with the biggest budgets are more likely to get noticed by voters.

The To Leslie campaign was reportedly self-funded and relied on word of mouth to get noticed.

Questions have now been raised as to whether Riseborough's nomination was fair - in an escalating row which has led to criticism once again of diversity at the Oscars, where none of the best actress nominees are black - and seen her co-star and others speaking out to defend her.

Blockbusters, first-timers and snubs - Oscars talking points

Although it did not mention To Leslie, the Academy, which organises the Oscars, has announced it is conducting a review of award ""campaign procedures"" to ensure no guidelines were violated this year.

The issue is due to be discussed at its next meeting later today.

So what is Oscar campaigning? What did Riseborough's celebrity backers apparently do wrong? Is any of it really fair? Here's everything you need to know.

Who is Angela Riseborough?

The 41-year-old actress is known for her work in the Oscar-winning Birdman, and for playing Wallis Simpson in WE and the former prime minister in Margaret Thatcher: The Long Walk To Finchley.

In 2022, she starred in the latest adaptation of Matilda, playing Matilda's mother Mrs Wormwood alongside Stephen Graham as Mr Wormwood, as well as Emma Thompson as Ms Trunchbull, Lashana Lynch as Miss Honey, and Alisha Weir in the titular role.

She also starred in Battle Of The Sexes, about the 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, playing King's lover Marilyn Barnett, and appeared in an episode of Black Mirror.

Riseborough was the first British actress to formally support the #4PercentChallenge, urging members of the film industry to work with female directors, following its launch by Creed actress Tessa Thompson at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2019.

She is nominated for her performance in To Leslie, a small-budget film which reportedly grossed around $27,000 (about £22,000) at the box office, according to US entertainment site Variety.

Which celebrities supported her?

In the run-up to the Oscar nominations, To Leslie broke through with the Academy seemingly in no small part thanks to a campaign by some of the most prominent names in Hollywood.

Indeed, Cate Blanchett, who is also up for the best actress Oscar alongside Riseborough, used her Critics' Choice speech to praise the Brition - along with others, it should be noted.

""Best actress, I mean, it is extremely arbitrary considering how many extraordinary performances there have been by women; not only in this room, but Andrea Riseborough and Tang Wei, Penelope Cruz, the list goes on and on,"" she said. Blanchett continued by saying she wanted to change how awards work and highlight the ""raft"" of performances.

Fellow Hollywood stars including Kate Winslet, Amy Adams, Gwyneth Paltrow, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Aniston, Zooey Deschanel, Frances Fisher and Helen Hunt have also praised Riseborough's performance.

Fisher, known for films including Titanic and Unforgiven, has been particularly vocal on social media about the actress's performance.

What's wrong with any of this?

There's nothing wrong with encouraging Oscar voters to watch a particular film, or praising a performance.

However, some posts supporting Riseborough on social media may have broken Academy rules if they reference ""competition"" by name or title.

If a formal complaint is filed, this could result in Fisher receiving a one-year suspension from the Academy, according to reports.

There is no suggestion that Riseborough broke rules herself.

But questions remain as to the authenticity of the backing for her. Were all these supporters genuinely wowed by her performance, or simply friends in high places, helping out a mate?

What is Oscar campaigning?

Studios can spend millions of dollars promoting their films in the run-up to and during awards season, making sure they have the attention of voters.

The aim is to construct a narrative that a film is ""Oscar worthy"".

Billboards go up, screening events are held, the stars will walk red carpets, do interviews, meet the right people.

In 2016, Susan Sarandon called for ""campaign finance reform"", saying the Oscars campaign race had become ""enormous"".

What has the Academy said about the latest controversy?

A statement released by the Academy on Friday did not reference Riseborough or To Leslie specifically.

""It is the Academy's goal to ensure that the awards competition is conducted in a fair and ethical manner, and we are committed to ensuring an inclusive awards process,"" the statement read.

""We are conducting a review of the campaign procedures around this year's nominees, to ensure that no guidelines were violated, and to inform us whether changes to the guidelines may be needed in a new era of social media and digital communication.

""We have confidence in the integrity of our nomination and voting procedures, and support genuine grassroots campaigns for outstanding performances.""

Why has this led to criticism about diversity at the Oscars?

This year, none of the best actress nominees are black.

Riseborough and Blanchett (Tar) are up for the award alongside Michelle Yeoh (Everything Everywhere All At Once), Michelle Williams (The Fabelmans) and Ana de Armas (Blonde), while strong contenders Viola Davis (The Woman King) and Danielle Deadwyler (Till) missed out.

Following the nominations announcement, Till director Chinonye Chukwu posted a statement on Instagram, saying: ""We live in a world and work in industries that are so aggressively committed to upholding whiteness and perpetuating an unabashed misogyny towards Black women.

""And yet.

""I am forever in gratitude for the greatest lesson of my life - regardless of any challenges or obstacles, I will always have the power to cultivate my own joy, and it is this joy that will continue to be one of my greatest forms of resistance.""

Of course, Davis and Deadwyler's names being missing from the shortlist is not Riseborough's fault.

When it comes to analysis of the nominees, the nods for de Armas and Williams have also been questioned - de Armas as the Marilyn Monroe biopic Blonde has been widely panned, despite her performance being praised, and Williams as the role of Mitzi Fabelman in The Fabelmans is considered by some to be a supporting role.

Support for Riseborough

Following the Academy's announcement, stars have spoken out in defence of Riseborough and To Leslie.

In the latest episode of his WTF podcast, her To Leslie co-star Marc Maron criticised the Academy's investigation.

""Apparently, the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences or whatever the f*** it is has decided to investigate Andrea Riseborough's grassroots campaign to get her the Oscar nomination,"" he said. ""Because I guess it so threatens their system that they're completely bought out by corporate interests in the form of studios.

""Millions of dollars [are] put into months and months of advertising campaigns, publicity, screenings by large corporate entertainment entities and Andrea was championed by her peers through a grassroots campaign which was pushed through by a few actors.

""The Academy is [like], 'Well, we gotta take a look at this. This is not the way it's supposed to work. Independent artists don't deserve the attention of the Academy unless we see how it works exactly. So, we're going to look into this'.""

Actress Christina Ricci apparently also defended Riseborough in an Instagram post, which has reportedly since been deleted. According to US entertainment site Deadline, the star wrote: ""So it's only the films and actors that can afford the campaigns that deserve recognition? Feels elitist and exclusive and frankly very backward to me.""

What happens now?

Well, it's down to the Academy to decide. Many think it's unlikely Riseborough's nomination will be withdrawn.

But even if she remains in the race, the nomination may now seem tainted - and following the initial positive reaction to her nod, voters could see her as too controversial to pick to win.

And for studios: why bother with all the promo when A-list recommendations can make even more impact?

Whether rules have been broken or not, this saga has lifted the lid on the deep pockets of awards campaigning - and how it's good promo, not necessarily just a good performance, that can turn a film or a star into a winner.

San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe told the Bay Area News Group that Chunli Zhao was enraged by the equipment bill, saying that a co-worker was to blame for the collision between his forklift and their bulldozer.

Authorities say Zhao, 66, shot and killed four workers and wounded a fifth employee on 23 January at California Terra Garden in Half Moon Bay, a city around 30 miles south of San Francisco.

He is accused of then going to nearby Concord Farms, where he had worked previously, and shooting dead three former colleagues.

Zhao previously told NBC affiliate KNTV-TV in a courthouse interview that he committed the shootings.

He said he was bullied and worked long hours on the farms and his complaints were ignored, the station reported.

Zhao said he had reportedly vented to his supervisor about the bill, but that the supervisor insisted he needed to pay. Zhao then allegedly shot the supervisor and the co-worker, the news outlets reported.

Speaking in Mandarin, Zhao told the television station from a county jail in Redwood City that he had been in the US for 11 years and had a green card.

He said he had a 40-year-old daughter in China and lived with his wife in Half Moon Bay.

Dallas Police said no arrests had been made in any of the investigations - which also included cages being cut and the suspicious death of an endangered bird - and did not confirm whether the incidents were linked.

In the latest case, officers believe someone cut an opening in an enclosure and took the two emperor tamarin monkeys, which are small primates with long whiskers that resemble a moustache.

""It was clear the habitat had been intentionally compromised,"" the zoo said in a statement.

Earlier this month, the zoo closed for a day-long search when a clouded leopard named Nova went missing.

She was eventually found near her habitat, but police said a tool had been used to cut an opening in its fencing.

A week later, an endangered vulture called Pin was found dead, with the zoo saying the death did not appear to be natural.

Gregg Hudson, the zoo's chief executive, said the vulture was found with a wound.

Ed Hansen, chief executive of the American Association of Zoo Keepers, said he could not recall a zoo that had dealt with so many similar incidents with such frequency.

""It appears that somebody really has an issue with the Dallas Zoo,"" he said.

Mr Hansen described Dallas Zoo's reputation as ""excellent"" within the industry, adding that accredited zoos had double-perimeter fencing and that a zoo as large as Dallas' would have a security patrol.

Dallas Zoo said in a statement that it had added additional cameras and increased overnight security patrols.

Health Secretary Steve Barclay, talking to the Health and Social Care Committee, says NHS worker retention is ""very important"" to solving the current strikes.

He says on average the additional income, on top of an NHS worker's base salary, is 29%.

He also says pension contributions for nurses are 20% which is higher than the private sector.

The health secretary says when looking at keeping staff they need to be looking at the overall remuneration package, not just the base pay.

When asked why that approach isn't working at the moment, he says there are other pressures and ""we are recruiting more than are leaving"".

However, he said there is a time lag between training people and them being fully qualified.

Mr Barclay said they need to look at more flexibility for staff, something he said trade union bosses have paid interest to.

There were 22,109 insolvencies in 2022, the highest figure since 2009 and an increase of 57% from 2021, when 14,059 businesses went bust.

Businesses are reeling from the end of the pandemic support packages, which provided a lifeline to small companies during the lockdowns.

The construction, retail, accommodation and food services sectors were the hardest hit, with businesses in these industries coming under severe strain from rising costs, staff shortages and weakening consumer demand.

The increase was driven by creditors' voluntary liquidations, which occur when directors choose to place a company into a liquidation process.

These hit 18,821, their highest level since records began in 1960.

Administrations, in which a struggling company has failed but can ultimately continue to trade as a going concern, rose by 54.6% to 1,231.

The findings suggest that the business landscape is undergoing a correction after the pandemic support packages kept many companies alive that may have collapsed earlier.

The number of company insolvencies rose sharply but this partly reflects the higher number of active businesses.

Meanwhile, the rate of company liquidations rose to 49.5 per 10,000 active companies. This is up from 32.9 from the previous year and the highest since 2015, but only around half the level seen in 2009.

Catherine Atkinson, director of restructuring and forensics at the professional services firm PwC, said: ""The Insolvency Service's report... is a stark reflection of the challenges businesses have been and will continue to face in the first quarter of 2023.

""Financial headwinds caused by trading costs, rent, interest rates and utility bills alongside other operational pressures are causing increasing amounts of drag on companies weathering working capital pressures as they wait for payments to come in for goods and services…The next few months will be a critical time for business resilience.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131132349/http://news.sky.com/story/business-failures-hit-highest-level-since-2009-after-end-of-pandemic-support-12799890

By increasing interest rates to 4%, the Bank of England may help savers, according to financial experts.



Following a period of ultra-low savings rates below 1%, a new account - potentially at a new bank - may offer a better return, according to Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest.

But with hints from the Bank that rates may have peaked, savers should consider acting before inflation drops, she said.

There are ""good options"" out there for savers, said Victor Trokoudes, CEO of the investment and budgeting app Plum.

""Hopefully this new base rate will benefit savers. It's good to see that some banks have now adjusted their interest rates,"" he said.

""With a wide range of interest rates available at banks and via smart money apps like Plum, there are some good options out there for growing your savings.""

Jason Ferrando, the CEO of money-lending platform easyMoney, called on more banks to increase return yields for their customers.

""Despite this latest rate rise hurting variable rate borrowers, there is a flip-side for investors and savers that is the yield on their savings may see a better return thanks to today's Bank of England decision.""

Rishi Sunak is under pressure to pick the right candidate as he struggles to draw a line under 'Tory sleaze' allegations - despite vowing to turn over a new leaf when he became prime minister.

Allies of Boris Johnson have already touted him as a potential successor, but there are others who are calling for someone who can create a ""positive headline"" to help turn around the party's fortunes in the polls.

The party chair is responsible for party administration and overseeing the Conservative Campaign Headquarters.

Here, Sky News looks at the potential runners and riders.

Boris Johnson

There has been speculation of a Johnson comeback after Jacob Rees-Mogg said he has ""all the right attributes"" to be party chairman.

The senior Tory MP and close ally of the former PM told GB News on Sunday: ""He is charismatic, he rallies the troops. He's a sort of fully-loaded Conservative. So I think that type of personality would be a very good one for a party chairman.""

However, others have warned such a move would be divisive, while Mr Rees-Mogg on Tuesday conceded the former prime minister's return to the front bench is unlikely.

""I think he would be a brilliant chairman, but he's not going to be chairman"", he told Sky News.

""The person who is going to be chairman needs to be someone who is close to the prime minister and also very charismatic.""

Paul Scully

The Tory vice chair under Theresa May and deputy chair under Boris Johnson, minister for London Paul Scully is seen as someone with the right skills and experience to replace Mr Zahawi.

Ex-cabinet minister Theresa Villiers is among those endorsing him, telling Sky News: ""Paul is a top campaigner. He has done brilliant work in this constituency and did very well when he was Deputy Chair at CCHQ.

""He knows how important it is to engage with minority ethnic groups and he also understands London which is a key electoral battleground.""

Justin Tomlinson

A relative outsider is the Conservative MP for North Swindon, Justin Tomlinson.

He was deputy chair during the successful Bexley by-election in December 2021 - the last by-election the Conservatives won.

Mr Tomlinson quit his position in July 2022 to help Kemi Badenoch launch her failed leadership bid, but prior to being an MP he ran a business supplying Conservative associations with their campaigning materials and is known to be something of a ""campaigning geek"" among colleagues.

One MP told Sky News: ""With a general election looming, we need someone with a strong track record of campaigning and fundraising. Justin Tomlinson is probably the strongest campaigner we have.""

Another did not go as far as naming him but said he would do a ""brilliant job"" if picked as chairman.

Gillian Keegan

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:31 'No way to stop teacher strike', says Education Secretary Gillian Keegan.

The current education secretary has also been tipped for the role.

In an article looking at Mr Zahawi's potential successors, Paul Goodman, the editor of Conservative Home website, said: ""Downing Street will want an appointment that creates a positive headline. It may take the view that the appointment of a woman will suit.""

The women in cabinet are Suella Braverman, Penny Mordaunt, Therese Coffey, Gillian Keegan, Kemi Badenoch, and Michelle Donelan.

Mr Goodman said: ""The first is too senior, the second too ambitious, the third associated with Liz Truss and the fourth difficult though not impossible to move, given her pivotal role at education. Such an appointment would undoubtedly create a splash.""

Penny Mordaunt

Commons leader Penny Mordaunt is reportedly keen on replacing Mr Zahawi at CCHQ and is said to have pitched her credentials alongside Business Secretary Grant Shapps during last week's cabinet away day.

Gavin Barwell, a Conservative peer and former chief of staff to Mrs May, said that while Mr Shapps has done the job before, Ms Mordaunt ""is probably the best choice"".

He said in the run-up to the election the party chair needs to be an important figure who can communicate with media and has experience campaigning in marginal seats.

He told Times Radio: ""When you look back at Rishi Sunak's cabinet when he put it together, I felt Penny didn't really get a role big enough to suit her talents, so this would give her a front and centre role in the run-up to the election.""

Priti Patel

A popular figure on the right of the party and well-liked among the Tory grassroots, Priti Patel is among the high-profile names tipped to replace Mr Zahawi.

While she has previously turned down the role, sources close to the former home secretary have not ruled out her return to the cabinet, according to the Telegraph.

Lee Anderson

Red Wall MP Lee Anderson has also been named as someone who could replace Mr Zahawi.

Marco Longhi, the Conservative MP for Dudley North, put a poll on Twitter asking who agrees with him that Mr Anderson ""would make a great chairman of the Conservative Party"".

While more than 72% of those who responded voted no, Mr Longhi suggested the hard left had got hold of the poll and the results show ""how worried they would be"".

However, it is unlikely Mr Anderson would be given the role.

The Ashfield MP has been outspoken on issues like foodbank usage and Channel crossings and last week compared the government to ""the band on the Titanic"", according to leaked WhatsApp messages seen by Sky News.

William Hague

After Mr Zahawi's sacking, rumours swirled that former Tory leader William Hague could make a return to frontline politics by filling the vacancy.

But Lord Hague, who is a close ally of Mr Sunak, quickly shut down that speculation.

1054;Andrea Riseborough: Why a British star's Oscar nomination has sparked controversy;Tuesday 31 January 2023 15:37, UK;['gemma peplow', '@gemmapeplow'];['andrea riseborough', 'oscars'];['oscar', 'controversy', 'andrea', 'academy', 'actress', 'oscars', 'leslie', 'best', 'riseborough', 'nomination', 'film', 'stars', 'campaign', 'sparked', 'awards', 'british'];"When British actress Andrea Riseborough's name was read out as one of this year's five Academy Award nominees for best actress, it came as something of a surprise to many.

Not because her performance in To Leslie - a small indie film in which she plays a single mother who turns to alcoholism after winning the lottery - wasn't worthy, but because there had been no substantial awards-season buzz surrounding her before the announcement.

This is how it works: the Oscars is the biggest night in Hollywood, the culmination of awards season, but it's not the only ceremony in Tinseltown.

Many will no doubt be aware of some of the events, such as the Golden Globes, while others including the SAG awards are less well known. And of course, there is also the BAFTAs in the UK.

Each awards ceremony has its own members voting but you tend to see the same names cropping up on the shortlists, give or take a few.

In 2022, for example, Will Smith, Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose and Troy Kotsur picked up the four acting prizes at pretty much every single ceremony, including, finally, the Oscars.

Riseborough, who starred in Roald Dahl's Matilda The Musical in 2022 and is also known for The Kindness Of Strangers, Made In Dagenham and Birdman, did not receive nominations for any other major awards this year, and nor did To Leslie.

However, before the Oscar nominees were announced, Riseborough did publicly receive the backing of some very prominent A-listers (more on this later).

During awards season, film studios campaign, campaign, campaign - which means projects with the biggest budgets are more likely to get noticed by voters.

The To Leslie campaign was reportedly self-funded and relied on word of mouth to get noticed.

Questions have now been raised as to whether Riseborough's nomination was fair - in an escalating row which has led to criticism once again of diversity at the Oscars, where none of the best actress nominees are black - and seen her co-star and others speaking out to defend her.

Blockbusters, first-timers and snubs - Oscars talking points

Although it did not mention To Leslie, the Academy, which organises the Oscars, has announced it is conducting a review of award ""campaign procedures"" to ensure no guidelines were violated this year.

The issue is due to be discussed at its next meeting later today.

So what is Oscar campaigning? What did Riseborough's celebrity backers apparently do wrong? Is any of it really fair? Here's everything you need to know.

Who is Angela Riseborough?

The 41-year-old actress is known for her work in the Oscar-winning Birdman, and for playing Wallis Simpson in WE and the former prime minister in Margaret Thatcher: The Long Walk To Finchley.

In 2022, she starred in the latest adaptation of Matilda, playing Matilda's mother Mrs Wormwood alongside Stephen Graham as Mr Wormwood, as well as Emma Thompson as Ms Trunchbull, Lashana Lynch as Miss Honey, and Alisha Weir in the titular role.

She also starred in Battle Of The Sexes, about the 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, playing King's lover Marilyn Barnett, and appeared in an episode of Black Mirror.

Riseborough was the first British actress to formally support the #4PercentChallenge, urging members of the film industry to work with female directors, following its launch by Creed actress Tessa Thompson at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2019.

She is nominated for her performance in To Leslie, a small-budget film which reportedly grossed around $27,000 (about £22,000) at the box office, according to US entertainment site Variety.

Which celebrities supported her?

In the run-up to the Oscar nominations, To Leslie broke through with the Academy seemingly in no small part thanks to a campaign by some of the most prominent names in Hollywood.

Indeed, Cate Blanchett, who is also up for the best actress Oscar alongside Riseborough, used her Critics' Choice speech to praise the Brition - along with others, it should be noted.

""Best actress, I mean, it is extremely arbitrary considering how many extraordinary performances there have been by women; not only in this room, but Andrea Riseborough and Tang Wei, Penelope Cruz, the list goes on and on,"" she said. Blanchett continued by saying she wanted to change how awards work and highlight the ""raft"" of performances.

Fellow Hollywood stars including Kate Winslet, Amy Adams, Gwyneth Paltrow, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Jennifer Aniston, Zooey Deschanel, Frances Fisher and Helen Hunt have also praised Riseborough's performance.

Fisher, known for films including Titanic and Unforgiven, has been particularly vocal on social media about the actress's performance.

What's wrong with any of this?

There's nothing wrong with encouraging Oscar voters to watch a particular film, or praising a performance.

However, some posts supporting Riseborough on social media may have broken Academy rules if they reference ""competition"" by name or title.

If a formal complaint is filed, this could result in Fisher receiving a one-year suspension from the Academy, according to reports.

There is no suggestion that Riseborough broke rules herself.

But questions remain as to the authenticity of the backing for her. Were all these supporters genuinely wowed by her performance, or simply friends in high places, helping out a mate?

What is Oscar campaigning?

Studios can spend millions of dollars promoting their films in the run-up to and during awards season, making sure they have the attention of voters.

The aim is to construct a narrative that a film is ""Oscar worthy"".

Billboards go up, screening events are held, the stars will walk red carpets, do interviews, meet the right people.

In 2016, Susan Sarandon called for ""campaign finance reform"", saying the Oscars campaign race had become ""enormous"".

What has the Academy said about the latest controversy?

A statement released by the Academy on Friday did not reference Riseborough or To Leslie specifically.

""It is the Academy's goal to ensure that the awards competition is conducted in a fair and ethical manner, and we are committed to ensuring an inclusive awards process,"" the statement read.

""We are conducting a review of the campaign procedures around this year's nominees, to ensure that no guidelines were violated, and to inform us whether changes to the guidelines may be needed in a new era of social media and digital communication.

""We have confidence in the integrity of our nomination and voting procedures, and support genuine grassroots campaigns for outstanding performances.""

Why has this led to criticism about diversity at the Oscars?

This year, none of the best actress nominees are black.

Riseborough and Blanchett (Tar) are up for the award alongside Michelle Yeoh (Everything Everywhere All At Once), Michelle Williams (The Fabelmans) and Ana de Armas (Blonde), while strong contenders Viola Davis (The Woman King) and Danielle Deadwyler (Till) missed out.

Following the nominations announcement, Till director Chinonye Chukwu posted a statement on Instagram, saying: ""We live in a world and work in industries that are so aggressively committed to upholding whiteness and perpetuating an unabashed misogyny towards Black women.

""And yet.

""I am forever in gratitude for the greatest lesson of my life - regardless of any challenges or obstacles, I will always have the power to cultivate my own joy, and it is this joy that will continue to be one of my greatest forms of resistance.""

Read more: Brendan Fraser on the 'Bren-aissance'

Of course, Davis and Deadwyler's names being missing from the shortlist is not Riseborough's fault.

When it comes to analysis of the nominees, the nods for de Armas and Williams have also been questioned - de Armas as the Marilyn Monroe biopic Blonde has been widely panned, despite her performance being praised, and Williams as the role of Mitzi Fabelman in The Fabelmans is considered by some to be a supporting role.

But it is not just in the acting categories that the issue of diversity has come up again - not for the first time, there are no women nominated for best director. Had Chukwu been nominated, she would have been the first black woman to make the shortlist.

Sky News got the chance to ask Women Talking director Sarah Polley about the absence of female directors, as someone who could well have been in the running herself; the film has been nominated for best picture and Polley is nominated for best adapted screenplay.

""To be honest with you, the biggest disappointment for me in that category was there was an opportunity to have the first black woman ever nominated for an Oscar in the directing category and that option wasn't taken,"" she said.

""When I think about movies like Till or The Woman King or Saint Omer, there were a lot of options, so for me I think that's what I see as this missed opportunity.""

Support for Riseborough

Following the Academy's announcement, stars have spoken out in defence of Riseborough and To Leslie.

In the latest episode of his WTF podcast, her To Leslie co-star Marc Maron criticised the Academy's investigation.

""Apparently, the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences or whatever the f*** it is has decided to investigate Andrea Riseborough's grassroots campaign to get her the Oscar nomination,"" he said. ""Because I guess it so threatens their system that they're completely bought out by corporate interests in the form of studios.

""Millions of dollars [are] put into months and months of advertising campaigns, publicity, screenings by large corporate entertainment entities and Andrea was championed by her peers through a grassroots campaign which was pushed through by a few actors.

""The Academy is [like], 'Well, we gotta take a look at this. This is not the way it's supposed to work. Independent artists don't deserve the attention of the Academy unless we see how it works exactly. So, we're going to look into this'.""

Actress Christina Ricci apparently also defended Riseborough in an Instagram post, which has reportedly since been deleted. According to US entertainment site Deadline, the star wrote: ""So it's only the films and actors that can afford the campaigns that deserve recognition? Feels elitist and exclusive and frankly very backward to me.""

What happens now?

Well, it's down to the Academy to decide. Many think it's unlikely Riseborough's nomination will be withdrawn.

But even if she remains in the race, the nomination may now seem tainted - and following the initial positive reaction to her nod, voters could see her as too controversial to pick to win.

And for studios: why bother with all the promo when A-list recommendations can make even more impact?

Whether rules have been broken or not, this saga has lifted the lid on the deep pockets of awards campaigning - and how it's good promo, not necessarily just a good performance, that can turn a film or a star into a winner.

Her mobile phone was found on a bench near where she was last seen on a towpath by the River Wyre in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. It was still connected to a conference call when it was found.

Ms Bulley's dog, a springer spaniel called Willow, was found loose between the river and bench.

Police said on Tuesday that searches are continuing, adding they are ""especially keen"" to find a ""potentially key"" witness they believe was in the area at the time Ms Bulley went missing.

""He is described as a man aged around 70, white, six ft tall, well-built who was walking a small white fluffy dog on a lead,"" a Lancashire Police statement said.

""He spoke to a woman in the area before walking in the direction of Rowanwater. If this is you, or if you know who this could be, please get in touch.""

A search of the area involving police specialist resources, working alongside colleagues from the Coastguard and Bowland Mountain Rescue, is continuing, the force said.

""We don't know why she's gone missing, where she is, we just want her home.""

Ms White and another friend, Heather Gibbons, have been part of a widespread community search following the disappearance of Ms Bulley.

Ms Gibbons added: ""It feels very surreal. You just want to wake up from it because it feels like a nightmare, that's what it is... a nightmare.""

Police said on Monday they were keeping an ""open mind"" about what happened but they do not believe Ms Bulley was attacked.

'Perpetual hell'

Ms Bulley's partner, Paul Ansell, said he spent all of Sunday searching for her.

Mr Ansell, an engineer, said: ""It is just perpetual hell. It is just utter disbelief.""

""We are living through this but it doesn't feel real,"" he said from the family home in Inskip, Lancashire.

""All we can say is we need to find her. She's got two little girls that need their mummy home.

""We have got to get some good news now.""

Ms Bulley, also known as Nikki, and Mr Ansell have been in a relationship for 12 years.

Police indicated she dropped her children, aged nine and six, to a local primary school before walking her dog on Friday.

""I got a call from the school regarding somebody who had found Willow, and Nikki's phone and the dog lead and harness on the bench,"" Mr Ansell, who then called the police, said.

""We take the kids to school and take the dog down there - either myself or Nikki - nearly every day.""

In its latest World Economic Outlook update, the IMF downgraded its UK gross domestic product (GDP) forecast once again, predicting a contraction of 0.6% against the 0.3% growth pencilled in last October.

The outlook for the year ahead puts the UK far behind its counterparts in the G7 group of advanced nations.

IMF's dire outlook for UK economy is 'wrong' - politics latest

The UK is also expected to be the only country - across advanced and emerging economies - to suffer a year of declining GDP.

But the PM's official spokesman told reporters the IMF itself ""said that UK economic policy is now on the right track"".

The spokesman added that the UK outperformed many forecasts last year and was ""predicted to grow faster than Germany and Japan over the coming years"".

But shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the government needs to do ""so much more"" to fulfil the potential of the UK economy.

Asking an urgent question on the IMF's economic outlook update in the Commons, Ms Reeves said: ""Britain has huge potential but 13 years of Tory failure has been a drag anchor on prosperity.

""Today's IMF assessment holds a mirror up to the wasted opportunities and it is not a pretty sight.

""The UK is the only major economy forecast to shrink this year. Weaker growth compared to our competitors for both of the next two years.

""The world upgraded, Britain downgraded. Growth even worse than sanctions-hit Russia.""

Taking aim at Chancellor Jeremy Hunt who was not in attendance, she added: ""If the chancellor had ideas, answers or courage, he would be here today. But he is not.""

Ms Reeves continued: ""The question people are now asking is this: are me and my family better off after 13 years of Tory government? The answer is no. And as the IMF show today, it doesn't have to be this way.""

Earlier on Monday, transport minister Richard Holden disputed the IMF's forecast.

Asked if the IMF is wrong, Mr Holden told Sky News: ""I think so.""

He added that the IMF has got its forecasts wrong ""in the last couple of years"", and that he thinks ""Britain can outperform its prediction like it has done for the last two years"".

The Conservative minister told Kay Burley that the UK economy has ""grown faster than Germany since 2016"" and ""grown faster than France, Italy, and Japan since 2010"".

Mr Holden also said the body's report ""praised"" the actions Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have taken to try to stabilise the country's finances.

Former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg agreed with Mr Holden, telling Sky News his earlier remarks about the IMF were ""sheer genius"".

""And when was the IMF forecast last right? So you've got to understand that forecasts are not historic fact.""

The 23-year-old footballer was pronounced dead around 30 minutes later.

Friends and family gathered at St Peter's Church in Coughton, near the Warwickshire town of Alcester, to remember the Stratford Town FC player, who had also played for Bromsgrove Sporting.

Mr Fisher's girlfriend Jess Chatwin told the congregation he had ""changed her life forever"" when she met him in August 2019.

""Cody was brave, he was caring and always had the best advice. He was always my go-to and taught me not only so much about the world but also about myself,"" she said.

Mr Fisher's mother Tracey Fisher described how close she and her son were.

""Cody and I had an amazing bond and we were truly best friends, sharing a home together,"" she said.

""I was always happy when Cody was in the house as it meant he was safe and I knew where he was.""

Recalling what would happen when her son was going out, she said: ""I would wave Cody off from the door when he left and make him text me from the taxi so I knew he was on his way home from a night out.

""Most times I would be awake waiting for him to come home, whether it was 2am or 5am.""

She spoke of their final day together on Christmas Day when he gave her an air-fryer that they were going to learn to use together that holiday.

The toy company's line for Barbie's little sister, Chelsea, will see a new addition that features curvature of the spine and a removable back brace, aimed at normalising the equipment and encouraging children to celebrate inclusion.

The team at Mattel worked closely with Dr Luke Macyszyn, a board-certified neurosurgeon and specialist in children's complex spinal disorders, who advised the designers throughout the doll's development.

The 15cm doll wears a pink dress and has a removable green back brace, white shoes, and her brown hair is styled in waves.

Celebrating inclusivity

Lisa McKnight, executive vice president and global head of Barbie and Dolls at Mattel, said: ""We believe in the power of representation and are committed to creating dolls in a variety of looks so that kids can see themselves in Barbie - and now in a line celebrating Barbie's little sister, Chelsea"".

Health Secretary Steve Barclay, talking to the Health and Social Care Committee, says NHS worker retention is ""very important"" to solving the current strikes.

He says on average the additional income, on top of an NHS worker's base salary, is 29%.

He also says pension contributions for nurses are 20% which is higher than the private sector.

The health secretary says when looking at keeping staff they need to be looking at the overall remuneration package, not just the base pay.

When asked why that approach isn't working at the moment, he says there are other pressures and ""we are recruiting more than are leaving"".

However, he said there is a time lag between training people and them being fully qualified.

Mr Barclay said they need to look at more flexibility for staff, something he said trade union bosses have paid interest to.

Lee Peacock cut the throats of 46-year-old Sharon Pickles and 59-year-old Clinton Ashmore in Westminster, central London, in August 2021.

Peacock, a self-confessed burglar and thief, had only been released from prison on 4 June 2021.

Peacock, 50, turned the 4cm-long knife on himself after a five-day manhunt led police to a houseboat, where he was hiding out.

He appeared at the Old Bailey on Tuesday, where the jury took two hours and 20 minutes to find him guilty of double murder.

He is due to be sentenced on Wednesday 1 February.

He admitted killing the pair, but had denied it was murder, claiming Ms Pickles' death was a ""pure accident"" and that Mr Ashmore had punched him in the head after he confessed to killing her.

During the trial, prosecutor Edward Brown KC described Peacock's actions as ""cold-blooded"" and ""determined"".

Jurors were told Peacock had turned up at his father's property with Ms Pickles's kitten in his rucksack on the evening of 19 August 2021. His father alerted the police that Peacock had confessed to being a killer.

Officers went to Ms Pickles' home in Marylebone and found her body wrapped up and hidden under a bed, with a signed confession nearby.

In the note, Peacock wrote that Ms Pickles was ""meant to live"" and he had sworn ""revenge"" against those who took advantage while he was in jail.

Later that day, Peacock was seen on CCTV walking with Mr Ashmore towards his Westminster flat, then leaving alone 15 minutes later.

Mr Ashmore was found dead by friends two hours later. Both victims died from similar knife wounds to the neck.

Mortgage approvals fell to 35,600 in December, the lowest number since May 2020 and down from 46,200 in November, according to data from the Bank of England.

The figure from the central bank is lower than had been expected - a Reuters poll of economists had forecast approvals of about 45,000 during December.

If the pandemic era is excluded, house purchase approvals are at the lowest level since January 2009 when 32,400 home purchase loans were approved.

Approvals have been slow since the Liz Truss government's mini-budget, when a number of mortgage products were pulled from the market as uncertainty spooked lenders.

The figures are just the latest sign of a slowing housing market.

Prices have been coming down overall as persistent double digit inflation means the cost of living is higher, and raised interest rates - hiked by the Bank of England in an effort to slow the economy to reduce inflation - have made the cost of mortgage payments more expensive, putting off would-be buyers.

While the Bank set the interest rate to 3.5%, the latest figures found that the effective interest rate - the actual interest rate paid - on new mortgages increased by 32 percentage points, to 3.67% last month.

The signs show this figure will continue to decrease while mortgage approvals, which indicate future borrowing, were down.

Cost of living pressures on households could be seen as people also continued to borrow more than they're repaying on credit cards.

He is being held on suspicion of rape and human trafficking - allegations he denies.

It's been a whistlestop few months of controversial Twitter posts, court dates and rows with climate campaigner Greta Thunberg.

Here's what led up to Tate's arrest and what has happened since he was detained.

April 2022 - the first raid

On 11 April, Tate's home was searched by Romanian police in relation to their investigation into claims of human trafficking and rape.

Romania's Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism, known as DIICOT, has pointed to this raid as evidence their investigation has been ongoing for months, and Tate's arrest in December was not linked to the pizza boxes shown in a clapback video aimed at Greta Thunberg (more on that later).

August 2022 - social media bans

Tate is banned from Instagram, Facebook and YouTube for violating rules on ""dangerous individuals"" and breaching hate speech rules.

This brought his tally of social media bans to five. He was kicked off Twitter in 2017 (but allowed back on in November 2022) and TikTok won't let him have an account - although that hasn't stopped his videos racking up millions of views on the platform.

He relaunched himself on the streaming platform Rumble, which describes itself as ""immune to cancel culture"".

Image: Tate has been banned from a number of social media platforms

27 December 2022 - Greta Thunberg row

Tate goads climate campaigner Greta Thunberg on Twitter, sharing a picture of himself standing next to a Bugatti, boasting about his 33 cars and asking for her email address so he could send details of their ""enormous emissions"".

Ms Thunberg's reply - featuring a fake email address mocking him and ending with the words ""getalife.com"". - became one of the most-liked tweets in history.

28 December 2022 - pizza clapback video

He follows up with a video where he smokes a cigar and tells Ms Thunberg to ""get a life"". He is passed a stack of pizza boxes bearing Romanian branding, spawning the theory that the video gave away his location to police.

There is no evidence this is the case although Ms Thunberg took the opportunity for a dig, tweeting: ""This is what happens when you don't recycle your pizza boxes.""

29 December 2022 - the arrest

Tate is arrested, along with his brother Tristan and two Romanian women. They were held on suspicion of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group.

They were initially detained for 24 hours, which was then extended to 30 days. A further 30 days were added in January, allowing them to be held until 27 February.

10 January 2023 - court appearance

The Tate brothers appear in court in Bucharest. They lost their appeal against the court extending their detention.

A document explaining the judge's motivation for the extension said ""the possibility of them evading investigations cannot be ignored"" and they could ""leave Romania and settle in countries that do not allow extradition"".

Their lawyers also argued - unsuccessfully - that the court should return possessions seized during their arrest, including properties, land, and a fleet of luxury cars.

""The UK is the only major economy forecast to shrink this year. Weaker growth compared to our competitors for both of the next two years.

""The world upgraded, Britain downgraded. Growth even worse than sanctions-hit Russia.""

Taking aim at Chancellor Jeremy Hunt who was not in attendance, she added: ""If the chancellor had ideas, answers or courage, he would be here today. But he is not.""

Ms Reeves continued: ""The question people are now asking is this: are me and my family better off after 13 years of Tory government? The answer is no. And as the IMF show today, it doesn't have to be this way.""

A former adviser to Ms Truss continued to claim the ex-PM had taken the right approach to the economy, even saying the country's finances would be in a better position had her plans been followed through.

Julian Jessop, who also used to be the chief economist at the Institute of Economic Affairs, told Sky News: ""Some tax policies backfired but [Ms Truss'] overall strategy was right, and was welcomed at the time by a number of business organisations.

""We're not the only major economy with a bad outlook - Spain too. The UK was hit harder by COVID than other economies, and by the energy crisis.""

He added: ""I don't think the hit from rising energy bills will be as big as people think. We need a change in policy to tackle these problems.""

Earlier on Monday, transport minister Richard Holden disputed the IMF's forecast.

Asked if the IMF is wrong, Mr Holden told Sky News: ""I think so.""

He added that the IMF has got its forecasts wrong ""in the last couple of years"", and that he thinks ""Britain can outperform its prediction like it has done for the last two years"".

The Conservative minister told Kay Burley that the UK economy has ""grown faster than Germany since 2016"" and ""grown faster than France, Italy, and Japan since 2010"".

Mr Holden also said the body's report ""praised"" the actions Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have taken to try to stabilise the country's finances.

Former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg agreed with Mr Holden, telling Sky News his earlier remarks about the IMF were ""sheer genius"".

""Well, first of all, this is a forecast,"" Mr Rees-Mogg said.

""And when was the IMF forecast last right? So you've got to understand that forecasts are not historic fact.""

Responding to the IMF's latest economic outlook earlier on Tuesday, the chancellor said ""these figures confirm we are not immune to the pressures hitting nearly all advanced economies"".

Britain fell seven places to be ranked 18th in the world after a year marked by the controversy around PPE procurement and a series of breaches of the ministerial code.

It was one of only five countries to see their year-on-year scores drop by five or more points, along with Qatar, Myanmar, Azerbaijan and Oman.

The CPI is compiled by Transparency International which uses impartial surveys from experts and business leaders to rank countries by the perceived level of corruption in their public sectors.

Chief executive Daniel Bruce said the slump was a ""powerful indictment of a recent decline in standards in government"" that should ""set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street"".

""The underlying data clearly indicate that business executives and other experts are concerned about insufficient controls on the abuse of public office and increasingly view corruption and bribery as a real issue in Britain,"" he said.

""This is the strongest signal yet that slipping standards are being noticed on the world stage.""

The report comes days after Rishi Sunak sacked Nadhim Zahawi as chairman of the Conservative Party after a row over his tax affairs.

The UK now ranks 18th alongside Belgium and Japan and behind Uruguay, Iceland and Estonia.

The event, which astronomers call an occultation, happened last night and was visible from parts of the US, northwestern South America, the Caribbean, and Mexico.

Similar to a lunar eclipse, when the Earth is positioned perfectly between the moon and the sun, the occultation saw the moon appear to pass in front of the red planet.

It disappeared for around an hour, and then emerged from the opposite side.

The moment was captured by the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, which livestreamed the event online.

Both the moon and Mars appeared particularly bright in the night sky during the occultation.

The moon was nearly 75% illuminated, while Mars was at over 90% - helping make it visible to the naked eye.

Such lunar occultations of planets are relatively rare when compared to those involving stars.

According to the website In The Sky, which provides forecasts for these events, the moon will pass in front of Jupiter during the evening of 22 February.

It is projected to be visible from Argentina, Chile, and the Falklands.

The next lunar occultation of Mars is due on 28 February, but visibility will be limited to Greenland, the freezing Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, and parts of western Russia.

The streets are teeming with people but everywhere is shrouded in acrid smoke from piles of burning rubbish.

From the hills above Port-au-Prince, the city at times disappears in a fog of polluted air.

Wherever you walk people ask for money. Beggars trudge amid the crowds, unemployment is high and kidnapping of anyone - not just the rich - is a constant fear.

Gangs control 60% of the entire capital.

Much of the city is a no-go area, it's simply too dangerous to venture inside the territory of the hundred-or-so gangs who operate here.

The police seem powerless to break the gangs down. They patrol in masks, carrying machine guns, but they do little to stop the crime rates that have rocketed in recent years.

Civil society has been crushed by political failure.

There are no elected officials in office; the country is run by politicians with no mandate and virtually no popular support.

A cholera outbreak is ripping through the slums of Port-au-Prince and millions are starving.

Haiti hasn't really recovered from a devastating earthquake in 2010. I was there then and have returned in the intervening years.

Each time, I'm shocked that rather than getting better, it's getting worse.

This country is falling apart and there is no safety net. The perverse reality is that the gangs have stepped in to fill the gap.

They offer work, protection, and security to those who welcome them.

I went to meet one of the leaders - he's arguably the most famous, and he's certainly the most vociferous.

Through a myriad of alleyways I was taken to his stronghold, surrounded by hooded armed men not wanting to show their faces on camera, I was introduced to the man known as 'Barbecue'.

'Barbecue' is actually Jimmy Cherizier, a former policeman, now gang boss who is the acknowledged mouthpiece for a coalition of gangs called the G9.

Image: Jimmy 'Barbecue' Cherizier has survived four assassination attempts

Folklore says his sobriquet comes from the way he treated his victims; his friends say it's because his mum ran a fried chicken stall and he's had the nickname since he was a child.

Either way, as he took large diamond earrings out and passed his revolver to a gunman before we could film, I decided I didn't want to find out which story was nearer the truth.

Barbecue requested we first sat down for an interview before he walked me around his territory, pretty much in the centre of Port-au-Prince.

He describes G9 as a group of armed young men and women with an ideology to change the lives of those who live in Haiti's notorious slums.

The Caribbean country has been bad for years and there is now no elected controlling authority at all.

Image: Police patrol but seem unable to break the gangs' grip

Some countries are actively considering sending in foreign soldiers to impose order, but Barbecue warns it will only end in disaster.

""If we have an intervention, the international community is understanding enough to sit down and have a decent conversation with everyone,"" he told me.

""But if they try to resolve it with guns, I think, many people in the slums could die and they will kill mostly innocent people, more than the guilty ones.""

Barbecue is a natural politician.

Many here question why at obvious moments of political vacuum he hasn't ascended the steps of the presidential palace and taken control.

There were two separate opportunities, I am told, by well-connected commentators who believe he could've grasped power - but he didn't.

Image: 'Barbecue' says G9 wants to improve the conditions of people in the slums

Image: The leader of G9 is constantly escorted by armed guards

He is sanctioned by the UK and its allies for ""engaging in acts threatening the peace, security and stability of Haiti"".

""I would like for one person to prove what they are accusing me of,"" Barbecue told me. ""I am a victim of a bunch of lies.""

Amongst the Haitian elite there is a view that Barbecue is in fact the pawn of a higher power.

He denies this and says he's a man of the people, and that G9 territory is home to 12 million people. ""We took up guns to change the living conditions of those less fortunate in the slums, we said it's to change their lives, we don't use guns to kidnap people,"" he insisted.

Barbecue's G9 is not known to be part of the overwhelming number of kidnappings taking place in Haiti today.

""We don't kidnap, and we don't rape. We are all fathers, we have sisters, aunts, we have kids. I have a daughter myself - I could never allow rape to happen around me.

""We don't kill for money, but we do have guns to defend ourselves, because we can't let others kill us.""

Midway through our chat, his guards a few metres up the road started messing about and laughing loudly, he was out of his seat in seconds.

His anger was clear as he told them to shut up in no uncertain terms. He returned to his seat and apologised.

For the hours we were with Barbecue he was constantly escorted by these machine-gun-toting guards.

He has survived four assassination attempts.

Image: A man lights candles for police officers killed by armed gangs. Pic: Reuters

As we walked through his neighbourhood, people came out to greet him - some fist-pumping, others shaking his hand, many just staring.

He dispenses money and largesse. It's hard to explain but this place is like a castle and inside Barbecue is the king.

He sees himself as a revolutionary fighting against the dark corruption of government and oligarch businessmen, but he is a gang leader. And his land - like all other gangs - is always under attack.

In some parts of his territory, his enemies are only one wall away.

We watched as he inspected his fighters manning the frontline barricades. Some are just breeze block walls with gaps for them to fire through.

In other streets sheets and blankets are strung up across the roadway to obscure the view of enemy snipers. The last time I saw that was in Aleppo.

Make no mistake, Port-au-Prince is a war zone.

But the irony is, when we were filming, we were safer in the G9 gang's territory than on most of the capital's streets, where kidnapping, murder and rape are endemic. And that is something every single person lives with here every single day.

The force had put an appeal out for the man to come forward earlier on Tuesday.

He was described as about 70-years-old, and is believed to have been in the area at the time Ms Bulley went missing.

In a statement, Ms Bulley's family said: ""We have been overwhelmed by the support from our community and would like to thank everyone for their ongoing efforts to help us find Nicola.

""The girls are desperate to have their mummy back home safe with them and your ongoing efforts have provided comfort to them whilst we await news on Nicola.""

The 45-year-old mother of two was last seen at 9.15am on Friday by a member of the public.

Her mobile phone was found on a bench near where she was last seen on a towpath by the River Wyre in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. It was still connected to a conference call when it was found.

Ms Bulley's dog, a springer spaniel called Willow, was found loose between the river and bench.

A search of the area involving police specialist resources, working alongside colleagues from the Coastguard and Bowland Mountain Rescue, is continuing, the force said.

Officers have said they are ""extremely concerned"" for Ms Bulley's welfare, but stressed that the investigation still remained a missing person inquiry and there is nothing, at the moment, to suggest third-party involvement in her disappearance.

'We just want her home'

Friends of Ms Bulley have told Sky News ""we just want her home"".

Emma White said: ""We've got two little girls wanting their mummy, so if anyone has any information please just come forward.""

She described Ms Bulley as ""the kindest, beautiful, lovely human being inside and out"", adding that her partner, Paul, was ""being strong as possible"" for the couple's two children, aged nine and six.

""We don't know why she's gone missing, where she is, we just want her home,"" she said.

Image: Map showing where Nicola Bulley went missing

Ms White and another friend, Heather Gibbons, have been part of a widespread community search following the disappearance of Ms Bulley.

""We want to hold on to the hope that no news is good news,"" Ms Gibbons said.

""But knowing Nicky, we just know that if she could be at home with her girls we very firmly believe that is where she would be.""

""She'd do anything for anybody, she is so well-loved within the community and school community.""

Ms Gibbons added: ""It feels very surreal. You just want to wake up from it because it feels like a nightmare, that's what it is... a nightmare.""

Police said on Monday they were keeping an ""open mind"" about what happened, but they do not believe Ms Bulley was attacked.

'Perpetual hell'

Ms Bulley's partner, Paul Ansell, said he spent all of Sunday searching for her.

Mr Ansell, an engineer, said: ""It is just perpetual hell. It is just utter disbelief.""

""We are living through this but it doesn't feel real,"" he said from the family home in Inskip, Lancashire.

""All we can say is we need to find her. She's got two little girls that need their mummy home.

""We have got to get some good news now.""

Ms Bulley, also known as Nikki, and Mr Ansell have been in a relationship for 12 years.

Police indicated she dropped her children at a local primary school before walking her dog on Friday.

""I got a call from the school regarding somebody who had found Willow, and Nikki's phone and the dog lead and harness on the bench,"" Mr Ansell, who then called the police, said.

""We take the kids to school and take the dog down there - either myself or Nikki - nearly every day.""

1074;Antony Blinken says US opposes anything that puts two-state solution 'further from reach' after violence in Jerusalem;Tuesday 31 January 2023 17:07, UK;[];[];['blinken', 'west', 'palestinians', 'bank', 'solution', 'israeli', 'puts', 'mr', 'opposes', 'violence', 'palestinian', 'jerusalem', 'antony', 'killed', 'reach', 'twostate'];"The United States will ""continue to oppose anything"" that puts a two-state solution ""further from reach"" after one of the bloodiest months in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in several years, the US secretary of state has said.

Antony Blinken said the US opposes Israeli settlement expansion and any moves towards the annexation of the West Bank.

The US secretary of state spoke in a news conference in Jerusalem on the second day of a two-day visit to Israel where he has met with the country's leader Benjamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas.

His comments come days after two shootings, one by a Palestinian gunman and another by a Palestinian teenager, left seven people dead and five wounded in Jerusalem.

Meanwhile, some 35 Palestinians have been killed in fighting, including 10 who were killed in an Israeli military raid in the flashpoint town of Jenin last Thursday.

Mr Blinken said today: ""The horrific terror attacks in Jerusalem, the escalating violence in the West Bank, have underscored the significant challenges to security and stability that the region faces and that we face.

""A rising tide of violence has resulted in the loss of many innocent lives on both sides... all sides must take steps to prevent further escalation of violence and restore calm.""

He continued: ""It's President Biden's firm conviction that the only way to achieve (peace) is through preserving and then realising, the vision of two states for two peoples.

""The United States will continue to oppose anything that puts that goal further from reach.

Advertisement

""We've been clear that this includes things like settlement expansion, the legalisation of outposts, demolitions and

evictions, disruptions to the historic status of the holy sites, and of course incitement and acquiescence to violence.""

Mr Blinken also said that during his meetings in Israel and the occupied West Bank he had heard a ""deep concern about the current trajectory"".

Image: A man uses a slingshot during a clash with Israeli troops in the West Bank

However, he also said that he heard concrete ideas from both sides that, if pursued, could help defuse the current situation.

Mr Blinken's first visit since Mr Netanyahu returned to power this month at the head of one of the most right-wing governments in Israel's history comes at a time of extreme tension between the two sides.

He said Palestinians were facing a ""shrinking horizon of hope"" that needed to change.

Amid rising anger at near-daily raids by Israeli forces in the West Bank, Abbas' Palestinian Authority (PA) suspended its security cooperation agreement with Israel last week after the largest incursion in years.

The operation saw Israeli forces penetrate deep into a refugee camp in the northern city of Jenin, setting off a gunfight in which 10 Palestinians died.

In January alone, 35 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops, in the bloodiest month since 2015, while officials say attacks on Palestinian property by Israeli settlers have also increased.

Blinken offered no concrete steps to calm the current tensions and right now its actions, not words, that are most needed Alistair Bunkall Middle East correspondent @AliBunkallSKY Mr Blinken's trip to the region was already planned but coincided with one of the worst periods of violence in years. In just 24-hours he met Israel's prime minister, foreign minister and the Palestinian president, regularly calling on ""all sides"" to do more to reverse the worrying trajectory that has seen 35 Palestinians and seven Israelis killed since the start of the year. He clearly grasps the severity of the situation but, as has become increasingly common with senior US diplomats visiting Israel and the West Bank, offered no concrete steps to change the dynamic. Speaking to journalists at the US embassy in Jerusalem he reiterated the view that a two-state solution remains the only viable path to peace, security and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians. He's right, but the same words have been uttered by every US secretary of state since the signing of the Oslo accords 30 years ago. In the eyes of many observers the situation is worse now, and prospects for peace slimmer than ever. Perhaps the announcement that senior members of his team will stay on to work on easing tensions is meant to provide short-term respite. It won't be enough. Israel's new right-wing coalition government is trying to impose itself in the face of massive internal weekly protests against it. Palestinians in the West Bank are growing increasingly desperate under occupation and militancy is on the rise. The Palestinian leadership in Ramallah is incapable of providing the essentials to its people. These are worrying times in the Holy Land. Stern words without real action will do little to change that.

On Friday, a Palestinian gunman killed seven people outside a synagogue in an east Jerusalem settlement on Friday.

The next morning, a 13-year-old Palestinian boy shot and wounded two Israelis elsewhere in east Jerusalem.

""The Israeli government is responsible for what is happening today, because of its practices that undermine the two-state solution and violate the signed agreements,"" Mr Abbas said during Mr Blinken's visit.

Mr Netanyahu has reinforced troops in the West Bank and promised measures to strengthen settlements there, but so far held off from more extreme steps.

On Tuesday, Mr Blinken met Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and discussed cooperation to stop Iran developing a nuclear weapon as well the situation in the West Bank.

Hopes of achieving a two-state solution, with a Palestinian state based largely in the West Bank, have all but disappeared since the last round of US-sponsored talks stalled in 2014.

The Biden administration has said it would re-establish a consulate for Palestinians shuttered by former President Donald Trump, but has yet to say when or where it will be opened.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131172509/http://news.sky.com/story/antony-blinken-says-us-opposes-anything-that-puts-two-state-solution-further-from-reach-after-violence-in-jerusalem-12800043

Police say their baby has been exposed to sub-zero temperatures for almost a month and the couple were ""constantly moving and awake for at least a few days"" after the birth.

The new pictures show the couple on the move on the evening of Saturday 8 January.

They then get a taxi to Haringey, north London, where they got into a second taxi just before 1.30am on Sunday morning.

The couple were then dropped off outside the port in Newhaven, East Sussex, just before 5am on Sunday morning, which was captured in a CCTV image.

They were carrying bags containing a two-man tent, sleeping bags and pillows that they had purchased from Argos the evening before.

The couple then walked to where the A259 crosses over the B2109 and were last seen sheltering from the rain under the overpass at around 6am. It is the last known sighting of the pair.

Police say the couple could still be camping somewhere in the UK.

Ms Marten, who is from a wealthy family, has lived an isolated life with Mr Gordon, a convicted sex offender, since they met in 2016.

The couple went missing after their vehicle caught fire near Bolton in early January. It is thought most of their belongings were destroyed in the blaze.

Police believe Ms Marten may have given birth just one or two days before the fire. Neither her nor their newborn have had any medical attention since they went missing.

""Both our children's teachers are striking in a junior school which means both of them need childcare,"" Mr Long said.

""I will have to not work. I will have to take an unplanned day off work and that means that the money I would've earned on that day ... won't be made, and that's going to be in the region of about £250.

""But to put this in context that's not £250 that goes into my pocket. From all of that I've got to pay my own holiday pay like any self-employed person does, I have to pay my own sick pay.

""Everybody plans their work time and their childcare around the school dates. And when we've planned all of that, and then you get a sudden change, then it becomes a problem.

""A school closes for a snow day because it's unsafe, that's fine, we've got to take that on the chin - this is a school closing because a national union has chosen to take a strike, and it's having a big financial impact on us for three Wednesdays.""

Detectives say they are ""extremely concerned"" about aristocrat Constance Marten, 35, and her boyfriend Mark Gordon, 48, who went missing after their car broke down in Bolton on 5 January.

Police say their baby has been exposed to sub-zero temperatures for almost a month and the couple were ""constantly moving and awake for at least a few days"" after the birth.

The new pictures show the couple on the move on the evening of Saturday 8 January.

The images show them walking near Brick Lane, east London at around 11.45pm where they dumped a pushchair.

They then get a taxi to Haringey, north London, where they got into a second taxi just before 1.30am on Sunday morning.

The couple were then dropped off outside the port in Newhaven, East Sussex, just before 5am on Sunday morning, which was captured in a CCTV image.

They were carrying bags containing a two-man tent, sleeping bags and pillows that they had purchased from Argos the evening before.

The couple then walked to where the A259 crosses over the B2109 and were last seen sheltering from the rain under the overpass at around 6am. It is the last known sighting of the pair.

Police say the couple could still be camping somewhere in the UK.

Ms Marten, who is from a wealthy family, has lived an isolated life with Mr Gordon, a convicted sex offender, since they met in 2016.

The couple went missing after their vehicle caught fire near Bolton in early January. It is thought most of their belongings were destroyed in the blaze.

Police believe Ms Marten may have given birth just one or two days before the fire. Neither her nor their newborn have had any medical attention since they went missing.

1079;Eva Green: Actress tells High Court she did not expect to have WhatsApp messages 'exposed' during lawsuit hearing;Tuesday 31 January 2023 17:58, UK;[];['eva green'];['say', 'exposed', 'tells', 'whatsapp', 'expect', 'seal', 'hearing', 'lawsuit', 'high', 'craig', 'star', 'film', 'white', 'messages', 'bond', 'eva', 'green'];"Hollywood star Eva Green has admitted it has been ""very humiliating"" to hear her private WhatsApp messages read out at the High Court, where she is suing a production company over a sci-fi film project that was dropped.

The 42-year-old French actress had been due to play the lead role in A Patriot, appearing alongside Charles Dance and Helen Hunt, but the production was cancelled in October 2019.

Green, best known for starring in Casino Royale alongside Daniel Craig, has filed a lawsuit against producers White Lantern Film, claiming she is still entitled to her fee of $1m (about £810,000) despite the project collapsing.

In turn, White Lantern Film is bringing a counterclaim against the French actress, claiming she undermined the independent film's production, made ""excessive creative and financial demands"" and had expectations that were ""incompatible"" with the film's budget. They have accused her of wanting to get out of the project.

The court has previously heard how in text messages, Green referred to one of the film's executive producers, Jake Seal, as a ""devious sociopath"", ""pure vomit"" and ""a liar and a mad man"". However, her barrister has said that White Lantern's claim is ""designed to paint my client as a diva to win headlines and damage her reputation"".

On Monday, she blamed her ""Frenchness"" for some of her messages.

Giving evidence for the second day on Tuesday, the star answered more questions about her messages. Max Mallin, representing White Lantern Film, asked Green about a message describing Seal as ""evil"", which also said that she had to ""get out"" of the film.

She denied this meant she wanted to withdraw from the project. ""If I really wanted to pull out, I would have asked my agent to do so in a legal way,"" she said.

""Are you accustomed to simply lying in casual WhatsApp messages?"" Mr Mallin asked.

Green said she had a ""very direct way of saying things"". She continued: ""I was not expecting to have my WhatsApp messages exposed in court, it's very humiliating. Sometimes you say things you don't mean.

""You say you hate a person and you say, 'I'm going to kill this person'. Are you going to kill this person? No. It's a cry from the heart.""

'Daniel Craig did another Bond movie'

The actress then referenced comments famously made by her former co-star Craig.

""Daniel Craig said: 'I would rather slash my wrists than do another Bond movie',"" she said. ""He did honour his contract and did another Bond movie and didn't slash his wrists. I know this story very well because I know Daniel.""

Craig, 54, made the comment in an interview in 2015 after finishing his penultimate Bond film Spectre.

He later accepted the remark made him appear ""ungrateful"" but said it was meant to be a joke - and went on to star in his final 007 film, No Time To Die, in 2021.

During her evidence, Green has admitted she did not want to work with Seal and his team, but said she would not have broken her contract.

George Santos has resisted calls for his resignation as a member of the US House of Representatives after it emerged he fabricated claims about his background.

Amid increasing pressure to step down, he has now announced that he will be ""temporarily rescued from committee assignments"".

""With the ongoing attention surrounding both my personal and campaign financial investigations, I have submitted a request to Speaker McCarthy that I be temporarily recused from my committee assignments until I am cleared,"" he said in a statement.

""This was a decision that I take very seriously. The business of the 118th Congress must continue without media fanfare.

George Santos: The truth about Republican 'fraud' and what the future holds for him

""It is important that I primarily focus on serving the constituents of New York's Third Congressional District and providing federal level representation without distraction.""

He added: ""I want to personally thank Speaker McCarthy for meeting with me to discuss the matter and allowing me to take time to properly clear my name before returning to my committees.

""To my constituents, I remain committed to serving the district, and delivering results for both New York's Third Congressional District and for the American people.""

The 34-year-old House of Representatives member had been given positions on congressional committees for science and small business.

Mr Santos was elected to the House of Representatives in November, but his short career in office has been dogged by continued revelations of falsehoods in his self-penned backstory.

On top of persistent questions about falsehoods surrounding his past employment, education, and family background, Mr Santos is facing separate investigations into his financial affairs and campaign finances.

Image: People demonstrate against Santos

What claims has Santos made?

He claimed his grandparents survived the holocaust, but genealogical research found no evidence they had Jewish ancestry. Mr Santos subsequently claimed never to have claimed to be Jewish, only ""Jew-ish"".

He said his mother was in the World Trade Centre during the 9/11 attacks, but immigration records show she wasn't in the country at the time.

His claim to have been a Wall Street banker has been discredited by the employers he listed on his CV.

He said he was a volleyball star at New York's Baruch College, but it said it had no record of him.

Drag performers in Brazil say they remember Mr Santos as a drag queen, named Kitara Ravache. When questioned, Mr Santos told reporters he merely had ""fun at a festival"".

'Deceit, lies and fabrication'

Calls for Mr Santos to resign as a congressman have been made by Republicans as well as his Democrat opponents.

1084;Reform UK has Tory voters in its sights but may struggle to make an impact;Tuesday 31 January 2023 19:13, UK;['liz bates', '@wizbates'];['brexit'];['labour', 'voters', 'winning', 'tory', 'reform', 'brexit', 'sights', 'party', 'seat', 'impact', 'tice', 'conservatives', 'uk', 'struggle'];"The UK officially left the European Union three years ago today, but just when it seemed that Brexit was no longer dominating the British political landscape, it could end up impacting another general election.

Targeting disaffected Brexit voters with a new plan to make it work is Reform UK - formerly the Brexit Party - now with Richard Tice instead of Nigel Farage at the helm.

Mr Tice is running to be the MP in the North East constituency of Hartlepool for the second time. It's a left-behind, Leave-voting town, typical of the areas where the party has previously done well.

And he's got 2019 Tory voters in his sights.

Politics latest: Brexit has been 'tricky', Cleverly admits

Speaking to Sky News today, he said: ""The country's broken, nothing works, and people are looking around and saying, 'what has happened? why is it like this?'

""We need change and that's what Reform UK is, I mean it's literally in the name.

""And we're saying, the country has so much potential, Brexit gave us that massive opportunity, but the Tories haven't taken advantage of it.""

The party has pledged to stand candidates in every seat across the country, but the reality of the first-past-the-post voting system in the UK means its impact could be limited to certain areas.

Pollster James Johnson told Sky News that although the party had very little chance of winning a seat, they could wound the Conservatives in key battlegrounds.

He said: ""In lots of the seats the Conservatives won in 2019 and [which] they are looking to hold on to - especially in the North and Midlands, places that voted Leave - it could be, on current polling, that Reform UK hurts the Conservatives in those seats.""

Image: Hartlepool is a former Labour seat, but was won by the Conservatives for the first time in a by-election in 2021

But he added: ""One word of warning … we saw this in 2015. Everybody was saying the polling showed in 2015 that UKIP, Nigel Farage would hurt the Conservatives more than Labour, and in the end they ended up taking votes away from Labour too.

""And although we're not seeing that happening in the polling at the moment… you could see that happening and that's dangerous for Keir Starmer because what Labour is relying on is winning back those voters that they lost last time around.""

In an attempt to move beyond Brexit and widen its appeal, Reform UK has launched a raft of new policies, from cutting taxes for people earning less than £20,000 to reducing NHS waiting lists to zero.

But speaking to some of its supporters in Hartlepool, there is still one main policy that is winning them support - reducing immigration.

Ian Griffiths, who owns a printing shop in the town and described himself as a swing voter, said he was drawn to Reform's stance on the issue.

Image: Ian Griffiths said he approved of Reform UK's position on immigration

""I'm against these massive numbers coming in now,"" he said, ""and it seems as though they can just come in willy-nilly and it is causing havoc with the NHS, causing havoc because of the amount of money it's costing the country"".

""We just can't afford it right now, millions if not billions in accommodation costs for people that are fleeing countries that are not at war.""

Others told us they didn't know much about the party but that they were fed up with both the Conservatives and Labour, and were open to a change.

With two years until the next general election, Richard Tice and Reform are already starting to have a small but increasingly significant impact.

It will be worth watching how the main parties respond.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131182436/http://news.sky.com/story/reform-uk-has-tory-voters-in-its-sights-but-may-struggle-to-make-an-impact-12800058

Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, told Sky News that the hardest fighting was yet to come and said the next few months would be crucial in deciding the course of the war.

He urged western allies to send more weapons, including Royal Air Force Typhoon jets from the UK and fighter aircraft from other partners.

""Russia is preparing for maximum escalation,"" Mr Danilov said in an interview on Tuesday at his headquarters in the capital Kyiv.

""It is gathering everything possible, doing drills and training.""

He did not rule out the possibility that President Vladimir Putin attempts another attack from the north, south and east, as happened on 24 February 2022 - maybe even to coincide with the anniversary.

""We do understand everything is on the table… I can say that we are not excluding any scenario in the next two to three weeks.""

He said that Ukraine's military was preparing for all possibilities and this time around had significantly more support from western partners such as the UK than 12 months ago.

""Those countries who help us in our struggle have started to provide us maximum help.""

""We will continue to monitor that,"" the western official said in a briefing to journalists.

""Traditionally they [Russia] have tried to do things on dates. The Ukrainians come from a similar culture as well in that regard, but I haven't seen anything from either side to suggest they do have plans afoot.""

Mr Danilov said he expected about half of more than 320,000 soldiers mobilised by Russia last September would be involved in the second wave whenever it came.

Image: Oleksiy Danilov speaks to Sky News

The first half of the manpower have already been deployed to Ukraine to replenish Russian lines after Moscow's invading forces suffered significant losses.

Ukraine has also paid a heavy price in military personnel and civilians killed and wounded.

'Bloodier days to come'

Yet the top security official predicted even bloodier days ahead.

""Of course. We went through an extensive difficult period, but I'm conscious the main fights are yet to come and they will happen this year, within two to three months. These will be defining months in the war,"" Mr Danilov said.

It is why the Ukrainians are desperate for their western partners to send more lethal weapons and faster.

They have secured tanks - belatedly - and are now after fast jets.

""It would be great if they were [RAF] Typhoon jets. F-16s are also good,"" Mr Danilov said.

""Any help would be good.""

It is not just Russian forces rearming and preparing to go on the attack.

""We have our own plans and they are clear to us,"" Mr Danilov said - but they are secret.

""They're not hidden from our main partners: the UK, US and other countries who are helping us. We will follow our plan.""

The ultimate goal is to retake all territory captured by Russian forces - not just since 24 February 2022 but since Russia launched its first invasion of Ukraine back in 2014, capturing the Crimean peninsula and backing so-called separatists in the eastern Donbas region.

""We will definitely win due to having all the world's support behind us,"" Mr Danilov said.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131205842/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-preparing-for-major-escalation-by-russia-top-ukrainian-security-official-tells-sky-news-12800187

1090;Alec Baldwin charged with involuntary manslaughter over fatal shooting on Rust film set;Tuesday 31 January 2023 20:54, UK;[];['alec baldwin', 'halyna hutchins', 'new mexico'];['rust', 'fatal', 'set', 'alec', 'charges', 'involuntary', 'charged', 'shooting', 'live', 'fe', 'announced', 'film', 'manslaughter', 'safety', 'baldwin'];"Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin has been charged with involuntary manslaughter over the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the western film Rust.

Baldwin has vowed to fight the charges against him, with his lawyer calling the case a ""terrible miscarriage of justice"".

Halyna Hutchins, 42, died after a prop gun held by the 64-year-old star was discharged during rehearsals for the movie in October 2021.

Her family welcomed the charges when they were announced earlier in January, saying Baldwin showed ""conscious disregard for human life"".

Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was responsible for weapons on the Rust set, has also been charged with involuntary manslaughter, while assistant director Dave Halls has signed a plea agreement for the charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon.

The decision on charges was made about three months after prosecutors received the final report on the shooting from the Santa Fe sheriff's office, following a lengthy investigation also involving the FBI.

Special prosecutor Andrea Reeb said at the time: ""If any one of these three people - Alec Baldwin, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed or David Halls - had done their job, Halyna Hutchins would be alive today. It's that simple.

""The evidence clearly shows a pattern of criminal disregard for safety on the Rust film set. In New Mexico, there is no room for film sets that don't take our state's commitment to gun safety and public safety seriously.""

Santa Fe's district attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies added: ""No one is above the law, and everyone deserves justice.""

Baldwin and the Rust production company reached a civil settlement for an undisclosed amount with Hutchins's family in October and announced that production of the film would resume this year. After the criminal charges were announced, the film's lawyer confirmed Baldwin would remain in the lead role in the film.

Hutchins's husband Matt will also remain executive producer - and Joel Souza, who was injured in the shooting, is returning as director.

A number of other lawsuits have also been filed in relation to the shooting.

Hutchins died on the set outside Sante Fe, New Mexico, when a revolver Baldwin was rehearsing with, fired with a live bullet.

Baldwin has denied responsibility for the shooting - saying live ammunition should never have been allowed on set and weapons handlers were responsible for firearm safety.

An investigation by Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office has yet to reveal how live rounds got onto the film set in the first place.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131205842/http://news.sky.com/story/alec-baldwin-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-over-fatal-shooting-on-rust-film-set-12799967
1091;'I killed her, she's under the floor': Moment man confessed to killing woman at his home recounted in court;Tuesday 31 January 2023 18:35, UK;[];[];['kitchen', 'burns', 'killing', 'burke', 'ms', 'shes', 'court', 'told', 'confessed', 'floor', 'man', 'woman', 'moment', 'innes', 'jellica', 'killed', 'evidence', 'recounted'];"A police officer has told a court of the moment a man confessed to killing a woman and burying her body under his kitchen floor.

Andrew Innes, 52, denies murdering Bennylyn Burke, 25, and her two-year-old daughter, Jellica, and has instead lodged a special defence of diminished responsibility.

Innes is currently on trial for murder at the High Court in Edinburgh.

Police Scotland officers Gavin Burns, 33, and Rhianne Brogan, 29, were called to give evidence for the Crown on Tuesday.

The PCs told the court they were sent to Innes' home in Troon Avenue, Dundee, on 5 March 2021 to carry out a welfare check as part of a high-risk missing persons inquiry.

Avon and Somerset Police had been looking for Ms Burke and Jellica, and believed they may have travelled north of the border in Innes' car, which had been identified as having made a trip from Bristol to Dundee.

PC Burns told prosecution lawyer Alex Prentice KC that Innes was ""a bit reluctant"" when he opened the door, had claimed to have COVID and that he was shielding as he had a condition.

Innes allegedly said: ""I know Bennylyn but she's in Glasgow.""

The officers managed to get into the house.

PC Burns said it was ""in a bit of a disarray"", adding: ""There was a fair bit of disturbance to the house.""

The officer claimed kitchen cabinets were off the wall, the floor was partially tiled and there was concrete showing.

Innes admitted that Ms Burke had travelled to Dundee with him. The pair had met via an online dating site.

Speaking to PC Brogan, he said he saw ""dozens of WhatsApp messages from many different males"" to Ms Burke.

He reportedly said: ""She had a date arranged for Monday. That's when I realised I was one of the 50 men she was speaking to.""

Innes then claimed to have ended the relationship and left Ms Burke and Jellica at the Old Inns Cafe in Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, in the company of another man.

After again being challenged by PC Burns, Innes allegedly confessed: ""I killed her, she's under the floor. We got into a fight and I killed her.""

He then queried what the jail sentence was for murder, before adding: ""It wasn't premeditated.""

The court had earlier heard that Mrs Burke, originally from the Philippines, had lived in Bristol after marrying Lexington Burke, 65, in August 2019.

Giving evidence to the court, Mr Burke said their relationship later broke down.

Mr Burke said he was due to pick up daughter Jellica on 19 February 2021 but was unable to reach Ms Burke.

Along with phone calls and text messages, he also posted a note through Ms Burke's door.

Image: Bennylyn Burke was buried under Andrew Innes' kitchen floor

Mr Burke said it was then he notified the police.

He said: ""My concern had reached the point of extreme concern.""

Ms Burke's disappearance was deemed ""out of character"".

A joint minute of agreed evidence between prosecutors and the defence team was read out to a jury at the start of the trial.

It was accepted that Innes stabbed Ms Burke, from Bristol, on the body with a knife as well as repeatedly striking her on the head with a hammer and the handle of the blade.

It was also accepted that Innes asphyxiated Jellica before burying both bodies under the kitchen floor of his property.

Innes is additionally accused of sexually assaulting Jellica. He denies a further charge of raping a primary school-aged child and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.

All the alleged incidents are said to have taken place at Innes' house in Troon Avenue, Dundee, between 20 February and 5 March 2021.

At Hazel Community Primary School in Leicester, headteacher Daniel Hansen has made the decision to close to all pupils.

He supports the majority of staff who plan to strike, and is making sure the walkout has maximum impact by not even providing childcare.

Instead, lunch boxes will be made available for pupils entitled to free school meals to collect from the site.

""I think there are two key elements of this,"" Mr Hansen said. ""There's the funded pay increase that we want for teachers that matches inflation.

""A huge element is the fact that we have to protect the education sector and the teaching profession going forward.

""We have to do something about it, otherwise nobody will want to become a teacher.""

At the school gate, many parents supported his decision, but others were concerned about who would look after their children as the UK faces the biggest day of industrial action in more than a decade with teachers, university staff, train drivers, civil servants, bus drivers and security guards all taking action.

Rachel Badzire has never been on strike before and, as a teacher in a special school in Cheshire, she has found the decision to walk out difficult.

'Enough is enough'

""I love my children that I teach, and I think it's a worthwhile job, however I do feel at this point in time it's good for me to join with other members of my union and show solidarity,"" she said.

""We need to put a message out to the government that enough is enough. We don't have much money, and we need to make sure that we can pay bills and still have a life"".

At Cockshut Hill Secondary School in Birmingham, they've decided to open to year 11 pupils who have their GCSE exams in the coming months as well as the youngest year group, year 7.

Any other pupils who are vulnerable will be allowed in, but the majority of pupils will have to remain at home.

Luca Duggan and Aya Seid are among the pupils who face a day of online learning. They're both in year 10.

'I'm a little stressed about it'

Luca, 14, said: ""We get a break off school, but then that may affect our learning, but we've got online learning so not too much to worry about really.""

He added it feels ""similar"" to time off during the pandemic, and said he supports teachers ""to an extent"".

""I feel like if that's what they're going to have to do to get the pay, then that's what they're going to have to do.""

Aya, 14, is more concerned. ""It is quite a shame that we don't get the education that we need,"" she said.

""I am a little stressed about it. In school each lesson contains so much knowledge and so much information that could help us get a few extra marks to get a grade 9 in GCSE, but even though we are at home we are getting lots of work to do.""

'Get around the table and seek a resolution'

Vince Green, the CEO of the Summit Learning Trust that runs Cockshut Hill and seven other schools, is urging the government and unions to reach an agreement so that further planned strikes don't happen.

""From my point of view we don't want disruption to the learning of children and young people particularly after the levels of disruption that they've had in recent years through no fault of their own,"" he said.

""What I'd really like to see if that the adults involved get around the table and seek a resolution prior to next month.""

""We are still negotiating and discussing issues of pay, of workload, and other issues that are of concern to teachers,"" he said.

They sounded exasperated about a two-page spread in one of the papers about the Princess of Wales's eyebrows.

Just her eyebrows. Can you imagine living that life where every part of your appearance is picked apart, and often overshadows what you have to say.

This week it's clear the Princess of Wales and her team want to do everything they can to get past that.

This is her week where she wants to start a national conversation ""to revolutionise the way the UK thinks about those early years of a child's life"" and ""to make this her life's work"", a palace source told me.

In cinemas, on billboards, on social media, and from celebrity ambassadors, you'll see campaign material for ""Shaping Us"".

The research makes the compelling case that as a society we simply don't focus enough on what we can all do - not just parents - to help children in those first five years in life to thrive and become happy healthy adults.

But as Kate was surrounded by cameras and crowds in Kirkgate Market in Leeds, the location for the launch of the campaign, it felt like there was something missing.

This didn't feel like the urgent call to action she wants it to be.

Princess of Wales launches childhood campaign - but faces calls for long-term investment instead

Kate is competing against a lot of noise, and I don't mean just in the market, but in society generally.

At a time when so many families are struggling with the cost of living crisis, when day-to-day worries are centered around heating their homes and feeding their children, this needs to be a campaign that grabs you and I'm not sure that it does at the moment.

She wants us all to wake up to the fact that we can play a part in making sure children don't fall through the net, but how do you make people care when they're struggling enough with their own problems?

In the past few months, I've been on a number of Kate's early years' visits. I've seen firsthand that she undoubtedly cares and she knows her stuff.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:18 The Princess of Wales at her campaign launch

During one visit she told an expert to keep sending over the research because she loves the science, the same day she repeatedly kept talking about the importance of communities doing more to support each other.

From toddlers to nursery staff to academics she makes people feel listened to, she wants to find out what is happening on the ground.

And it's not just because she has three children herself.

For over a decade she's been focusing on the links between early childhood and things like addiction, and getting experts in the room to figure out how she can use her platform to have the maximum impact.

""Shaping Us"" is her way of showing you what she wants to do as the new Princess of Wales.

Don't forget she is more constrained than other campaigners; as a royal she can't be seen to be lobbying, even though the provision of childhood services and the cost of childcare are deeply political issues.

But her challenge now is how to get her message to really punch through.

This morning the front pages focused on the red suit she was wearing at a BAFTA event on Monday.

Last week, on the day she met with leading childcare and paediatric experts who'll be helping her with this project, a headline on Twitter read: ""Princess Kate's black outfit and glossy blow-dry just turned everyone's head.""

As her team would say ""societal change doesn't happen overnight"" - that also seems to count for the way Kate's work is covered and the media's obsession with how she looks.

But above all else, we keep hearing that the princess wants us to know she's committed to this for the long haul.

For her, this is just the start of a vital conversation with the nation.

Announcing the news on Instagram, the 23-year-old shared a photo of her week-old baby laying in a crib in a nursery that featured the name Bambi in light-up lettering on the wall.

It was simply captioned with her daughter's name, followed by a white love heart.

Although the post initially allowed users to comment, the function later disappeared – suggesting Hague had opted to turn them off.

Her partner and father to Bambi, Tommy Fury, didn't post a name announcement on his feed at the same time, but did share a sweet message and photo on his Instagram story.

""The best mummy in the entire world. Watching how you take care of Bambi makes me love you more than I knew I could,"" he wrote, sharing a picture of Hague and their baby in hospital.

""You're everything I could have ever dreamed of for a mum and role model for our perfect girl. Thank you for making my dreams come true babe, I love you.""

The chancellor was confronted at a meeting of the backbench 1922 Committee on the same day a grim economic forecast put him under more pressure to cut taxes.

Leading the onslaught demanding tax cuts was the veteran Thatcherite ex-minister Sir Edward Leigh, who told Mr Hunt voters were depressed by the cost of living crisis.

No 10 insists UK economy is strong despite IMF warning it will fare worse than any other in developed world

Sir Edward, a leading Brexiteer who was sacked by Sir John Major for opposing the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, called on the chancellor to cut corporation tax, income and fuel duty.

He told Sky News after the meeting: ""I said 'you can't wait until the general election. People are depressed. You've got to give them hope.'

""You've got to say: 'We made the right decisions in September, therefore that's given me room in this budget to cut taxes, whether it's corporation, personal or fuel'.""

The chancellor was challenged directly on fuel duty during the meeting by Red Wall MP Jonathan Gullis, a leading campaigner on the issue, amid fears of a 12p-a-litre hike in the Budget on March 15.

A disappointed Mr Gullis told Sky News: ""He told me: 'We'll have to see how the public finances are at the time'.""

Other MPs present also left the meeting alarmed that Mr Hunt failed to rule out an increase.

But loyalist backbencher David Simmonds, describing the meeting, said: ""Everyone agrees that tackling inflation is the short-term priority and that there will be a return to a tax-cutting agenda once inflation is under control.

""He also spoke about the big reduction in business rates that's coming in April and the impact that will have on small businesses.""

Asked about the mood in the meeting, Mr Simmonds said: ""It was very positive, actually. People are very serious because the challenge of inflation is a big one, but at the same time there's a good window of opportunity to get it right. People see that.""

Defence spending

Mr Hunt's appearance at the committee came only hours after the International Monetary Fund published a damning report blaming weakness in the UK economy on higher taxes and rising interest rates.

But there was surprise among some of the Tory MPs attending the 80-minute meeting that none of those present called for an increase in defence spending in the chancellor's Budget.

This week Sky News revealed that a US general said the UK was no longer a top-level fighting force because of defence cuts and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace admitted the armed forces had been ""hollowed out"" by the Tories.

1101;Treasury reveals 'world-first' proposals to regulate cryptocurrency;Tuesday 31 January 2023 22:46, UK;[];['cryptocurrencies'];['reveals', 'industry', 'sky', 'proposals', 'told', 'investors', 'seen', 'regulation', 'worlds', 'worldfirst', 'cryptocurrency', 'regulate', 'treasury', 'crypto', 'plans'];"The Treasury has revealed proposals to regulate cryptocurrency, following widespread calls for action after the spectacular collapse of one of the world's largest trading exchanges.

Promising a ""robust"" approach to digital assets consistent with traditional finance, the government says it wants exchanges to have fairer and tighter standards.

Under the plans, crypto platforms would become responsible for defining the demands that a currency must meet before being admitted for trading.

Exchanges will also be held accountable for safely facilitating transactions and keeping customer assets safe.

It comes after the deputy governor of the Bank of England told Sky News that crypto trading is ""too dangerous"" to remain outside mainstream regulation.

Speaking in light of the sudden bankruptcy of crypto platform FTX, Sir Jon Cunliffe described the market as ""incredibly volatile"" and said investors needed more protection.

Some 80,000 UK-based customers were impacted by the collapse of the world's second-largest crypto exchange, with one British investor left with a £1m hole in his finances.

FTX's disgraced founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, has since pleaded not guilty to stealing billions of dollars in customer money.

Are the government's plans sufficient?

The proposals - which Labour said had arrived too far too late - come as the crypto industry seeks to regain the confidence of spooked investors.

Since FTX collapsed, wider market turmoil has seen Bitcoin, the world's biggest token, fall to a five-month low and major exchange Coinbase cut 20% of its workforce.

Less than a year ago, Rishi Sunak, then chancellor, said he wanted the UK to be a ""global crypto asset hub"".

Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government was still committed to enabling crypto, but stressed the need to ""protect consumers who are embracing this new technology"".

The plans will first be submitted to a consultation, but the Treasury claims the regulation will be a ""world first"", suggesting it should arrive before the EU's expected crypto legislation in 2024.

In the meantime, the Treasury announced it would be introducing a time-limited exemption to let more crypto asset companies issue promotions following a crackdown on ""misleading"" adverts.

Firms that are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority for anti-money laundering purposes will be allowed to while the broader regulation is being introduced.

'We've been waiting a long time'

Crypto fraud expert Louise Abbott, a partner at Keystone Law, welcomed the proposals.

She told Sky News that the lack of regulation in crypto made it ""hugely attractive to fraudsters"".

""We have been waiting in this industry for a long time,"" she said.

""I deal with fraud and have seen a dramatic increase in crypto scams and fraud in the past 10 years. Last year, I was getting daily enquiries from potential victims who have been defrauded through a crypto scam.""

Ms Abbot hopes the regulation could be in place as soon as the summer, adding that it was in the interests of both exchanges and investors for greater oversight of the market.

Major industry players including Binance chief Changpeng Zhao, who saw his platform banned in the UK in 2021, and Coinbase's Brian Armstrong have previously welcomed the prospect of more regulation.

""Unless we become a safer environment, investors will not invest in the way we have seen,"" Ms Abbot added.

Varun Paul, former head of fintech at the Bank of England, now of crypto infrastructure provider Fireblocks, also described the plans as a ""positive step"".

He told Sky News that industry turmoil meant there was a need for ""clear rules"", and expressed hope that the UK's regulation would do the job while still encouraging innovation.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131225936/http://news.sky.com/story/treasury-reveals-world-first-proposals-to-regulate-cryptocurrency-12799964
1102;1,000 Border Force officers to go on strike for four days during February half-term, PCS union announces;Tuesday 31 January 2023 23:22, UK;['jennifer scott', '@nifs'];['strikes'];['officers', 'travellers', 'warned', 'union', 'having', 'money', 'days', 'force', 'civil', 'pcs', 'strike', 'action', 'announces', '1000', 'ports', 'halfterm', 'border', 'strikes'];"Border Force officers will stage fresh strikes during the February half-term over an ongoing pay dispute with the government.

The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union confirmed on Tuesday night that 1,000 staff would be taking part in walkouts on 17, 18, 19 and 20 February across four ports - Dover, Calais, Coquelles and Dunkirk.

General secretary Mark Serwotka said the move would ""impact on people returning from their holidays"", but said the ""blame"" for the action ""lies firmly at the feet of ministers who are refusing to put any money on the table"".

A Home Office spokesperson said they were ""extremely disappointed"" with the decision and warned travellers to ""be prepared for disruption"".

This latest strike announcement comes ahead of mass industrial actions across several sectors on Wednesday, which will include teachers, train drivers and civil servants.

And it is the second walkout by Border Force staff after it staged strikes in airports across Christmas.

During that action, the government brought in military personnel to plug the gaps, and it is understood they will do so again, alongside civil servants and volunteers.

Mr Serwokta warned that the military would not be able to fill in for the ""highly-skilled and experienced officers"" in French ports, however.

The union boss criticised the government for failing to move on its pay offer, adding: ""They say they will talk about money for next year, but our members - who have been offered just a 2% rise at a time when inflation is around 10% - cannot afford to wait for next year.

""Many civil servants are already having to choose between heating and eating, having to claim the benefits they themselves have to administer and they are having to go to foodbanks.

""Ministers should be ashamed at how they treat their own workforce and until they come to the table with money for our members, we will continue to call strike action, with tomorrow's strike being a key part of what will be a continuous, sustained, targeted campaign.""

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We are extremely disappointed with the union's decision to strike and the inconvenience this will cause to travellers and businesses.

""We continue to work closely with all affected ports to assess the impacts of this announcement. Whilst we have robust plans in place to minimise any delays, passengers should be prepared for disruption and take action to plan ahead.

""Those intending to travel or ship goods into the UK over strike days should keep up-to-date with the latest advice from operators to check how the strike action will affect them.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230131225936/http://news.sky.com/story/1-000-border-force-officers-to-go-on-strike-for-four-days-during-february-half-term-pcs-union-announces-12800134

Baldwin has vowed to fight the two counts against him, with his lawyer calling the case a ""terrible miscarriage of justice"".

A live round killed Halyna Hutchins, 42, after a prop gun held by the 64-year-old star was discharged during rehearsals for the movie in October 2021.

The charges - which could see Baldwin sent to jail for up to five years - would require prosecutors to convince a jury that Baldwin was not just negligent but reckless in his use of a firearm.

Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was responsible for weapons on the Rust set, has also been charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter.

Legal experts have said prosecutors will struggle to win convictions without proof Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed knew live ammunition was present but took no precautions.

In a statement of probable cause of Hutchins's death, the Santa Fe District Attorney listed several problems with Baldwin's conduct.

They said:

Baldwin was not present for required firearms training

After failing to show up to this training, he received a 30-minute on-set training during which he was distracted talking to his family on the phone

He exhibited ""reckless behaviour"" in the lead up to Hutchins's death

He had pointed the firearm at Hutchins in the lead up to the incident violating gun safety rules

Baldwin had not performed the required safety checks with Gutierrez-Reed

He broke protocol by letting Gutierrez-Reed leave the church set

He did not deal with safety complaints on set

He did not use a replica firearm for the unscheduled rehearsal

He allowed the hiring of Gutierrez-Reed, who had worked on just one production before the movie, which showed he ""failed to demand the minimum safety standards, protocols, and requirements on set""

The District Attorney also said that on the day of the shooting, there were ""no less than a dozen acts, or omissions of recklessness"" on the set before the incident, not including the actor's handling of the gun.

""Baldwin's deviation from known standards, practice and protocol directly caused the fatal death of Hutchins,"" the District Attorney said.

Both Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will be required to appear in court - in person or virtually - within 30 days.

The District Attorney and special prosecutor will then present their case to the judge, who will rule whether there is probable cause to move forward with a trial.

Hutchins's family welcomed the charges when they were announced earlier in January, saying Baldwin showed ""conscious disregard for human life"".

Rust assistant director Dave Halls is facing negligent use of a deadly weapon charges. He has pleaded no contest and has entered into a plea agreement that is pending approval.

Industry-wide firearms safety guidelines instruct actors to assume a firearm is loaded with blanks and rely on professional weapons handlers to ensure a weapon is safe.

Actors are told to only point a weapon at a person under the guidance of firearms professionals. Live ammunition is strictly forbidden on sets.

Gutierrez-Reed said she checked the rounds she loaded in the revolver were dummies before handing it to Halls.

Image: Baldwin pictured in New York as the charges were due to formally be filed

Halls handed it to Baldwin, telling him it was a ""cold gun"" or unloaded, according to police.

Gutierrez-Reed's lawyer, Jason Bowles, said: ""Hannah pleaded to provide more firearms training. She was denied and brushed aside.""

He added: ""We will fight these charges and expect that a jury will find Hannah not guilty.""

The decision on charges was made about three months after prosecutors received the final report on the shooting from the Santa Fe sheriff's office, following a lengthy investigation also involving the FBI.

The sheriff's office investigation has yet to reveal how live ammunition got onto the set.

Baldwin and the Rust production company reached a civil settlement for an undisclosed amount with Hutchins's family in October and announced that production of the film would resume this year. After the criminal charges were announced, the film's lawyer confirmed Baldwin would remain in the lead role in the film.

The 19-year-old disappeared on her way to work at a finance company in Milton Keynes on 15 February 2019.

A murder investigation was launched last week after the discovery of the remains in a house in the city in Buckinghamshire.

A post mortem examination last week did not uncover her cause of death and investigations are continuing, police said.

Items belonging to Ms Croucher were also found in the property in Loxbeare Drive, Furzton, which is a few minutes away from her home.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Superintendent Kevin Brown, head of the major crime unit at Thames Valley Police, said: ""After a difficult process, we are now in a position to formally confirm that the body found in Loxbeare Drive last week is that of Leah.""

Last week Ms Croucher's parents, Claire and John, laid flowers at the property where her remains were found.

They said they would ""cherish her memories forever"", writing in a message: ""Our darkest fears have come true, we only need to be apart a little longer. We have so missed you for so long already.

""The future looks so bleak now we know we will never see your smile or hear your laughter again. We will cherish your memories forever. We love you. Mum and Dad xx xx"".

Her grandparents also left roses near the house, along with a handwritten note saying: ""Our darling, we will never stop seeking answers. Will love and miss you always.""

Missed opportunities to arrest prime suspect

Convicted sex offender Neil Maxwell was named by police this month as the prime suspect in the murder inquiry.

He was found dead on 20 April 2019 after taking his own life.

Police started searching the property on 10 October this year after receiving a tip-off from a member of the public.

Officers had visited the house on two earlier occasions but insisted this was the first time Ms Croucher's disappearance was linked to the address - despite conducting about 4,000 house-to-house calls.

They changed their investigation from a missing person's probe to a murder inquiry after discovering the remains.

It has since emerged Maxwell was the only person with keys to the house, which was unoccupied when police were conducting their inquiries.

He was wanted in connection with a sexual assault and used false names and changed his mobile phone and vehicles to avoid police.

The force made a total of 18 attempts to arrest Maxwell - initially at an address in Milton Keynes on 30 November 2018.

Police said if he was alive today, they would be seeking to arrest him.

Mr Brown added: ""Our investigations into Leah's murder will leave no stone unturned and we owe it to Leah's family to ensure we find the truth.""

Teachers in England and Wales who are members of the National Education Union are set to stage walkouts - affecting 23,000 schools.

Estimates from the NEU suggest 85% of schools across both nations will be fully or partially closed today, leaving some parents with no choice but to take leave from work or arrange childcare.

Train drivers from the RMT and Aslef unions are also staging another strike as a long-running dispute over pay and conditions rumbles on - with university lecturers, bus drivers and security guards taking action too.

About 123 government departments are set to be disrupted by industrial action as well.

Protests are due to be held across the country against the government's controversial plans for a new law on minimum service levels during strikes.

Downing Street has conceded that today's mass strike action will be ""very difficult"" for the public.

The prime minister's official spokesman said it is ""disappointing"" that headteachers do not know fully how many teachers will be available for work until later today.

Union bosses continue to argue with employers for higher pay rises to combat record high inflation and real-term cuts over the past decade.

The latest research from the TUC suggests that the average public sector worker is more than £200 a month worse off compared with a decade ago.

But ministers continue to insist increasing wages to that level would fuel inflation, and its top priority was to cut that down over the coming weeks and months.

More strikes are expected next week and will be dominated by NHS staff, with both nurses and ambulance workers planning action.

NHS consultants in England are also preparing for possible strike action.

And the following week will see Border Force officers at four ports strike over four days in the February half-term.

Scale of school strikes revealed

Some schools may only open to certain year groups as a result of today's industrial action.

Liverpool City Council is expecting 38% of schools to be closed, with 54% only partially open, based on returns from 130 of around 160 schools in the city.

Meanwhile, Norfolk County Council said they had already been informed of 121 partial closures and 29 full closures across schools.

The NEU's joint general secretary, Kevin Courtney, said he and his members ""sincerely regret"" the impact this will cause to a child's education and routine, but warned: ""We're pointing to disruption that is happening every day in schools.

""If we don't persuade government to invest in education that disruption just carries on.""

While a 5% pay rise has been offered to most teachers - covering the current school year - the NEU is demanding a fully funded, above-inflation pay rise.

Today marks the first of seven days of NEU strike action across February and March, but Mr Courtney hopes a deal can be reached before further walkouts take place.

He said: ""There are 28 days until the next strike in England. The government can resolve it in that time.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201012349/http://news.sky.com/story/biggest-day-of-strikes-in-over-a-decade-begins-as-teachers-train-drivers-and-civil-servants-walk-out-12800313

The Argentinian midfielder played a key role in his country's 2022 World Cup win and scooped the competition's best young player award.

Fernandez, 22, will make the move from Portuguese side Benfica.

The deal breaks the previous record of £100m, paid by Manchester City to Aston Villa for England star Jack Grealish in August 2021.

It means Chelsea have now spent more than £300m on transfers in January, including securing an £88.5m deal for Ukrainian forward Mykhailo Mudryk.

Fernandez was left out of Benfica's squad for their game against Arouca on Tuesday night - and underwent a medical in Portugal ahead of his switch to Stamford Bridge.

According to Portuguese broadcaster SIC, Fernandez will fly to the UK this morning, with a private jet scheduled to leave Lisbon airport at 10.20am.

Fernandez will help to replace Jorginho, who joined Chelsea's London rivals Arsenal on Deadline Day in a £12m deal.

This is the biggest deal in the history of British football - and Chelsea have spent more money on transfers than all the other clubs in the major European leagues put together: Germany, Spain, Italy and France.

Which? found that a medium cappuccino at Costa contains a ""massive"" 325mg of caffeine - around the amount contained in four cups of tea and almost five times stronger than a Starbucks cappuccino.

While the variations are not only due to the number of caffeine shots used across the chains, nutritionists say you may be consuming ""significantly more or less caffeine than you bargained for"".

The study found that cappuccinos from Greggs and Pret A Manger contain significantly less caffeine than Costa, at 197mg and 180mg respectively. By comparison, a 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine.

When it comes to a single espresso, one from Starbucks contains a ""meagre"" 33mg of caffeine - meaning at 180mg, one from Pret contains almost six times more.

On filter coffee, Pret A Manger led the way with the most caffeine at 271mg - two-and-a-half times as much as the Starbucks version, which contained 102mg. Greggs was a close second containing 225mg.

The variations are also due to the type of coffee beans used, of which there are two main types - Arabica and Robusta.

Arabica beans contain around half the caffeine of Robusta beans, and there are also variations in taste between the two.

""Our analysis has shown that there are big variations in caffeine content between drinks from different high-street coffee shops.

""Most of the time this shouldn't be an issue but if you drink a lot of coffee or need to limit your caffeine intake you might want to consider what you're ordering and where from.""

The findings also show that buying coffee on the high street could be potentially problematic for consumers who are sensitive to caffeine, or are pregnant.

The NHS says pregnant women should consume no more than 200mg of caffeine per day, advising that a mug of instant coffee contains 100mg and a mug of filter coffee contains 140mg.

It said: ""We're making this classifier publicly available to get feedback on whether imperfect tools like this one are useful.

""We recognise that identifying AI-written text has been an important point of discussion among educators, and equally important is recognising the limits and impacts of AI generated text classifiers in the classroom.""

""With global food costs coming down from their 2022 high and the cost of oil falling, we expect to see some inflationary pressures easing.

""However, as retailers still face ongoing headwinds from rising energy bills and labour shortages, prices are yet to peak and will likely remain high in the near term as a result.""

Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NielsenIQ, said: ""Consumer demand is likely to be weak in the first quarter due to the impact of energy price increases and, for many, Christmas spending bills starting to arrive.

""So the increase in food inflation is going to put further pressure on household budgets and it's unlikely that there will be any improvement in the consumer mindset around personal finances in the near term.

1113;The financial gulf between English and European football has never been more stark;Wednesday 1 February 2023 02:04, UK;['rob harris', '@robharris'];['chelsea', 'premier league 2022/23'];['younger', 'european', 'rest', 'sky', 'stark', 'premier', 'players', 'gulf', 'football', 'transfer', 'financial', 'spending', 'league', 'english', 'spent'];"The football financial gulf between England and the rest of Europe has been stark in the January transfer window.

Premier League clubs spent about £650m combined on strengthening squads for the second half of the season.

Teams in the next biggest leagues - Spain, Italy, Germany and France - spent less than £200m combined.

It's an indicator of the wealth of English football, underpinned by television income (of which Sky News owner Comcast is a large contributor).

Splashing the cash so freely reflects the desire for instant success. Particularly at Chelsea.

No club has spent more in a year than the Blues - £600m. Half has been splurged in the January window - more than spending in the rest of Europe combined.

Before the transfer window closed last night, Chelsea were still able to break the British transfer record with the £106.8m signing of Enzo Fernandez from Benfica.

The 22-year-old would barely have registered on the radar, even of football fans, until winning the World Cup with Argentina in December.

It could seem like an expensive gamble. Especially for a team that has slumped to 10th in the Premier League despite the lavish summer outlay when it is more accustomed to being in the top four Champions League places and winning trophies like the FIFA Club World Cup last year.

The new ownership - fronted by Todd Boehly and funded heavily by Clearlake Capital - has more than shown it can more than match previous investor Roman Abramovich for transfer binges until he was sanctioned over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""They have a very strong economic foundation,"" football finance expert Prof Tom Cannon told Sky News. ""They are smart about selling players as well as buying them.""

The wisdom of the spending so much, so quickly, will be determined by results more so than on the balance sheets for their fans.

Complying with financial regulations will be Chelsea's challenge.

As how such vast spending looks when the rest of the country is dealing with a cost of living crisis.

And the government is preparing to introduce plans for legislation to introduce a regulator for English football amid calls for more of the Premier League's wealth to flow down the football pyramid.

A concern will be imports are being prioritised over homegrown talent - particularly at Chelsea, which was forced to promote youngsters while the club was serving a transfer ban in the summer of 2019 for rule breaches.

Former Premier League manager Tony Pulis told Sky News: ""They seem to have double-backed on themselves.

""Instead of playing maybe the younger ones and giving them the opportunity and the chance to perform, they've gone out and spent a fortune.

""The unlucky thing for the younger players coming through, they're buying young players, they're spending fortunes on younger players from Europe.""

1115;World Hijab Day and the women who are breaking boundaries and stereotypes;Wednesday 1 February 2023 03:15, UK;[];[];['stereotypes', 'women', 'boundaries', 'sky', 'felt', 'breaking', 'ms', 'wear', 'khan', 'wearing', 'world', 'day', 'hijab'];"The hijab has long evoked strong feelings, both within Islam and among non-followers of the religion.

World Hijab Day was created in an effort to promote personal freedom of religious expression and improve cultural understanding by inviting women from all walks of life to experience the hijab for one day, on 1 February.

This year marks the 11th annual celebration and aims to encourage ""progression, not oppression"", supported by the #UnapologeticHijabi hashtag on social media.

Here, Sky News looks at the stories of four women - including the founder of the global campaign.

How it all began

Nazma Khan launched World Hijab Day in 2013 after realising she was far from alone in facing prejudice simply because she chose to cover her hair.

She travelled to the United States from Bangladesh with her family at the age of 11 and moved into her new home in the Bronx, New York.

She began to wear the hijab soon after moving, and said she had faced intolerance from some since that point.

""Women in different parts of the world were also subject to abuse and discrimination for wearing the hijab,"" she told Sky News.

""My parents came to America to give us a better education and I didn't want to disappoint them.""

As she began to build a life in a country that was foreign to her and her family, she said she was faced with many challenges and unwelcoming comments.

'Kids would wait for me outside of school to surround me and spit at me'

Describing her encounters and transitions into a new town and school, Ms Khan said students would often mock and insult her because of her hijab.

""They would call me names such as 'batman', 'ninja' and 'Mother Teresa',"" she said.

She said children ""would wait for me outside of school to surround me and spit at me"", and would often threaten to remove her hijab.

'I felt like someone had taken my identity'

Public life post-9/11 was difficult for many Muslims in the US and Ms Khan, who was attending college at the time, said it made her life much worse.

""I was chased down the streets of New York City and labelled as a terrorist for being a visibly Muslim woman,"" she said.

""I was so scared to step out of my home.""

The racist abuse and chants led her to remove her hijab.

""I thought maybe this would be easier, but it wasn't,"" she said.

""I walked into college, feeling uncomfortable, I clung onto my clothes and wanted to cover myself.""

Becoming tearful, Ms Khan said: ""I felt like someone had taken my identity away.""

After a day without the hijab, she said she decided that life without it was not what she wanted, and that she chose to challenge her strength in the face of racism and discrimination.

""After removing my hijab and wearing it again, it felt as though I was renewing my intentions with my hijab,"" she said.

She said the move felt empowering; the racist chants no longer discouraged her and instead became a source of strength.

The Facebook page that would become a global movement

In 2013, Ms Khan created a Facebook page titled ""World Hijab Day"".

It was designed as a platform where people could gather to tell their hijab stories and show support for one another.

Ms Khan said it also provided the opportunity for non-hijabis and non-Muslims to walk ""in my shoes for one day"".

""I wanted to help my sisters to ease their situation by bringing greater awareness of the hijab,"" she said.

""So, I asked women from every background and faith to wear a headscarf on February 1st in solidarity with Muslim women.""

She said that by 2014, the World Hijab Day page had reached more than 44 million people and that it became a trending topic on Twitter the following year.

Ever since its launch 10 years ago, the movement has had many milestones, including being recognised by the states of New York and Michigan and being featured on Meta's official Instagram page.

TIME Magazine recognised 1 February as World Hijab Day in 2016.

Non-muslim women now get involved in the event by wearing a hijab on 1 February, taking selfies and attending events.

Freedom of choice

While recognising the empowering benefits of the hijab to many, it is also important to acknowledge that it has taken on a very different symbolism in some parts of the world.

In Iran, women have been fighting for their freedom and the right to choose how they dress.

The death of Mahsa Amini in 2022 caused outrage across the country.

The 22-year-old had been arrested by Iran's so-called ""morality police"" for allegedly not wearing the hijab in accordance with the nation's strict laws.

Her death in custody prompted many Iranians to take to the streets to demonstrate against the government and their rules around hijabs.

In France, however, while hijabs themselves are not banned, regulations also govern how women are allowed to dress.

The country made it illegal to wear a face-covering veil or other masks in public spaces through a law passed in 2011.

And in 2022, a French court ruled that women in the city of Grenoble should not be allowed to wear full-body ""burkini"" swimsuits in public pools.

Understanding the hijab

The term hijab, in Arabic, refers to a partition or curtain - both in a literal and metaphorical sense.

It is also the name given to a garment worn by Muslim women to cover their hair, which many Muslims believe is obligatory in Islam for all females who have reached puberty.

The hijab is often worn as an act of worship in the Islamic faith.

It has become a sacred form of attire for many Muslim women and the piece is worn in various ways, in different styles and colours.

The hijab, for some, is a sign of resilience, hope and progress.

For many women and girls, it is a part of their identity and there has been significant change to the way the hijab and Islam are seen.

From the worlds of media to politics, the hijab and the women who wear it have made strides over the years to break down boundaries and re-write stereotypes associated with it.

Apsana Begum

Apsana Begum, 32, was the first hijab-wearing member of parliament, after being elected as a Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse in 2019.

Talking to Sky News about her journey, she recalled first entering the parliamentary chamber.

""It was a full house and I remember seeing heads turn from the opposite benches,"" she said.

""I stood out and realised the gravity of what we had achieved with me being elected.""

Ms Begum said she felt this paved a path for other hijabi women in the UK who also had ambitions in politics.

""It has been incredible to give people a sense of hope and a sense of aspiration,"" she said.

She also spoke about the specific challenges she faced when she was first elected.

""The context in which we were at the time with the election and with the former prime minister Boris Johnson's 'letterbox' comments... It was tough,"" she said.

The hijab, for Ms Begum, is a symbol of togetherness, and she said she felt it was at the ""core"" of who she is as an individual.

Fadumo Olow

Fadumo Olow, 27, is a sports reporter at Sky Sports who first started wearing the hijab around the age of 11.

She told Sky News her hijab journey was influenced by seeing her community members, family and friends wearing it.

Speaking on her connection to the hijab, she said that before the age of 16 she was ""very relaxed with it, maybe not understanding it too much"" but later ""made a conscious effort to understand the hijab"".

Ms Olow said that as she grew up, she learned about the ""importance of the hijab in Islam, but also the value it holds for Muslim Women around the world"".

""After the age of 16, I took it more seriously and it brought me closer to my faith,"" she said.

She says the hijab helps ""uplift"" her ""more than the average person probably thinks"", adding that it was the reason she started wearing it in the first place.

Ms Olow said the hijab made her feel ""a sense of empowerment, peace and comfort"".

When asked about the industry she works in, she said: ""It is rare to see women who wear the hijab on sports news.

""However, the steps taken towards visual representation in this industry show there is space for everyone and we are walking in the right direction.

""The hijab makes me more conscious and at ease and I hope to carry it in the best way.""

Furvah Shah

Furvah Shah is a 23-year-old journalist who started wearing the hijab at the age of 15.

She told Sky News that when she first started wearing the garment, she was faced with many difficulties.

""People I'd known for many years began to treat me differently,"" she said.

She also highlighted the abuse she dealt with as a result, experiencing Islamophobic comments and uncomfortable stares.

Choosing resilience over hatred, Ms Shah did not allow the negativity to feed into her hijab journey.

She said that she felt the hijab brought a ""sense of community"", and was a chance for her to represent her faith in a positive light and change the negative images people associate with Islam.

""The hijab, for me, is belonging and empowerment,"" she added.

So what next for Ms Khan and World Hijab Day?

Speaking about her future plans, Ms Khan said: ""We want to create a job training and mentorship program for those women who are struggling with their hijab.""

She and her team are working to create workshops within educational institutions and workplaces.

They will offer women the chance to seek help and guidance if they do feel their hijab is being threatened.

Ms Khan told Sky News that in order for people to understand Islam and the hijab, ""we need to have a dialogue to change the world, we need to bridge the gap, extending our heart and hand to others.

""It's our job to go out there and teach, so people can understand us"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201031632/https://news.sky.com/story/world-hijab-day-and-the-women-who-are-breaking-boundaries-and-stereotypes-12789502

Teachers in England and Wales who are members of the National Education Union are set to stage walkouts - affecting 23,000 schools.

Estimates from the NEU suggest 85% of schools across both nations will be fully or partially closed today, leaving some parents with no choice but to take leave from work or arrange childcare.

Train drivers from the RMT and Aslef unions are also staging another strike as a long-running dispute over pay and conditions rumbles on - with university lecturers, bus drivers and security guards taking action too.

About 123 government departments are set to be disrupted by industrial action as well.

Protests are due to be held across the country against the government's controversial plans for a new law on minimum service levels during strikes.

Downing Street has conceded that today's mass strike action will be ""very difficult"" for the public.

The prime minister's official spokesman said it is ""disappointing"" that headteachers do not know fully how many teachers will be available for work until later today.

Union bosses continue to argue with employers for higher pay rises to combat record high inflation and real-term cuts over the past decade.

The latest research from the TUC suggests that the average public sector worker is more than £200 a month worse off compared with a decade ago.

But ministers continue to insist increasing wages to that level would fuel inflation, and its top priority was to cut that down over the coming weeks and months.

More strikes are expected next week and will be dominated by NHS staff, with both nurses and ambulance workers planning action.

NHS consultants in England are also preparing for possible strike action.

And the following week will see Border Force officers at four ports strike over four days in the February half-term.

Scale of school strikes revealed

Some schools may only open to certain year groups as a result of today's industrial action.

Liverpool City Council is expecting 38% of schools to be closed, with 54% only partially open, based on returns from 130 of around 160 schools in the city.

Meanwhile, Norfolk County Council said they had already been informed of 121 partial closures and 29 full closures across schools.

The NEU's joint general secretary, Kevin Courtney, said he and his members ""sincerely regret"" the impact this will cause to a child's education and routine, but warned: ""We're pointing to disruption that is happening every day in schools.

""If we don't persuade government to invest in education that disruption just carries on.""

While a 5% pay rise has been offered to most teachers - covering the current school year - the NEU is demanding a fully funded, above-inflation pay rise.

Today marks the first of seven days of NEU strike action across February and March, but Mr Courtney hopes a deal can be reached before further walkouts take place.

He said: ""There are 28 days until the next strike in England. The government can resolve it in that time.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201031632/https://news.sky.com/story/uk-strikes-no-10-admits-very-difficult-day-ahead-as-hundreds-of-thousands-of-workers-walk-out-12800313

ITV News reported that images were shared on a WhatsApp group in which male firefighters allegedly made degrading comments about victims.

In an interview with ITV, a female firefighter at the service said: ""There's explicit pictures, there's photos of accidents, sometimes you can even see the dead body in the accident.

""Retrieving the body of someone dead should tear you apart, not make you want to take photos of it, just to joke about it later because that's someone's loved one, isn't it? That's someone's relative.""

She also claimed she saw people ""say comments about the type of underwear the women are wearing in the car crash"".

Ben Ansell, chief fire officer of Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue, said in a statement that the police have been alerted as allegations of criminal behaviour are involved.

The service is commissioning an independent investigation into the claims, during which all female staff will have the opportunity to speak to an independent organisation.

It has also set up a confidential helpline which staff can ring with any ""immediate issues"" as a result of these allegations.

Mr Ansell said: ""The matters that have been raised with us are deeply concerning and we take allegations of this nature extremely seriously.

1118;NASA Columbia disaster: The investigation into one of history's worst space tragedies - and its lasting legacy;Wednesday 1 February 2023 03:38, UK;[];['nasa', 'space'];['disaster', 'worst', 'mission', 'investigation', 'launch', 'crew', 'space', 'lasting', 'astronauts', 'legacy', 'hubbard', 'okeefe', 'historys', 'nasa', 'tragedies', 'columbia', 'shuttle'];"Scott Hubbard remembers exactly where he was on the day of one of the deadliest tragedies in the history of space travel.

Before he stepped out of bed on the morning of 1 February 2003, a radio broadcast brought news that NASA's Columbia space shuttle was ""overdue"" on its return to Earth.

""I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach that something had gone wrong,"" he recalls.

The spacecraft, which had launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida just over two weeks prior, with seven astronauts aboard, was scheduled to land that morning.

But the landing never came.

Columbia, which flew its maiden voyage back in April 1981, disintegrated over Texas 16 minutes before its planned Florida touchdown, killing its entire crew. They were commander Rick Husband; pilot William McCool; the mission specialists Michael Anderson, Laurel Clark, David Brown and Kalpana Chawla; and payload specialist Ilan Ramon, who was the first Israeli astronaut.

It marked the beginning of the end for America's space shuttle programme, which had already endured the loss of seven astronauts in the Challenger disaster of 1986.

For Hubbard, a veteran of the US space agency who served as its first Mars programme director, Columbia changed his view of rocket launches forever.

""When that low-frequency rumble, that pressure wave hits you, you have a feeling of awe about the power that is being used to lift out of the gravity well of the Earth. But having had the Columbia experience, when I see a launch that has people on board, there's that extra sense of anxiety: 'Have I done everything possible to ensure mission success?'""

The call that changed everything

Before the loss of the crew was even confirmed, Hubbard received a call from the NASA administrator's office asking him to represent the agency in an investigation into what happened.

The administrator at the time was Sean O'Keefe, who was with the families of the astronauts when it became clear something was wrong.

""The mood went from excitement and anticipation to despair, once it became evident that the shuttle wasn't coming home,"" he tells Sky News.

""Normally, you can set your watch as to when the shuttle will come through the atmosphere. Just like a launch day, we had a countdown clock, with these big numbers that would progressively roll downwards.

""It got to within about two minutes of 00 - usually before you see the shuttle, you hear two sonic booms as the shuttle passes the sound barrier, which tells you it's about to land. Neither sonic boom showed up.""

The breakup of Columbia had already occurred, its wreckage raining down on Texas while the crew's loved ones waited unawares at the Kennedy Space Center.

Not long later, the official investigation was launched.

Scott Hubbard was picked as the only NASA representative on the investigative board to work with Air Force generals, Navy admirals, and former US astronauts to paint a detailed picture of why Columbia ended in tragedy.

""I knew, if we were facing loss of the crew, that this would be having the same impact on the agency that the Challenger accident had years before,"" he says.

""So I went into this with a determination to do whatever I could.""

'The most difficult duty'

The Columbia investigation was expected to last 30 days. It ended up taking six months.

Beginning with seven-day work weeks from a base outside Johnson Space Center in Houston, Hubbard labels it the ""most difficult duty"" of his 20 years at NASA.

""The first part was the very sad search and recovery operation for the remains of the crew, so the families could have some closure,"" he says. Remains for all seven astronauts were found.

Some 25,000 people were involved in efforts to collect pieces of the wreckage, O'Keefe recalls, which was strewn across a 200-mile swathe of land from Dallas to the Louisiana border.

Image: Tributes left outside NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston

Hubbard's background in science and engineering saw him assigned to focus on the technical cause of the accident.

""Initially, it was circumstantial evidence,"" recalls Hubbard.

""There was only one good, high-resolution image of this piece of foam falling off of the main tank and hitting the shuttle somewhere on its left wing, and then a spray of debris coming out.""

That incident had occurred not during re-entry, but after the launch on 16 January - 82 seconds into the flight.

Mission control notified the commander and pilot, who were assured that - because it had happened on previous missions too - there was no reason for alarm when it came to re-entry.

Proving the cause of the tragedy

But when Columbia re-entered the atmosphere, the damage to the wing let in ""superheated gases"" that led to the destruction of the wing and subsequent disintegration of the entire shuttle.

""Foam falling off had been happening since the very first flight of the shuttle, 30 years before,"" says Hubbard.

""But while it was originally labelled an in-flight anomaly, which is the most serious of problems, it eventually became considered a turnaround issue, just a maintenance thing, and was demoted in its seriousness.

""We think this casual approach, to what was a serious issue, was one of the organisational causes of the accident.""

Image: G. Scott Hubbard during a news briefing on the investigation into the disaster

Due to a ""sense of denial"" among those who were interviewed during the investigation, Hubbard says he pushed for a test that would look to recreate the so-called anomaly, settling on a research facility in Texas used to simulate the impact of a bird striking parts of an aeroplane.

Over the course of months, it was configured to the specifications of what happened to Columbia.

The test was carried out on live TV on 7 July 2003 - and the result was beyond doubt.

""It caused two emotions in me simultaneously,"" Hubbard recalls.

""One was 'yes, we proved it', and the other was, 'oh my God, this is how these people died'.

""And that was... quite a moment.""

The legacy of Columbia

The Columbia Accident Investigation Board's full report - which O'Keefe received 10 days before its publication in August 2003 - made 29 recommendations to improve the safety of future space shuttle flights, all of which were adopted by NASA.

They included that foam falling from the shuttle's external tank during launch, as had been accepted as par for the course among NASA engineers, should no longer be allowed to happen.

The agency has not lost astronauts during spaceflight since.

""It was a hard-hitting report,"" says O'Keefe. ""Nothing was light about it. It was very critical, however, that's what we needed to hear.""

NASA commemorates the victims of Columbia, as well as its other fallen astronauts, every January, with flowers laid and tributes read during a memorial service at Kennedy Space Center.

The site at Cape Canaveral has been a hub of excitement since November, when the launch of the Artemis mission kicked off NASA's bid to return people to the moon for the first time in more than 50 years.

Space is also increasingly the playground of private enterprise, with the likes of SpaceX and Blue Origin setting themselves grand targets to go further than humans have before. A worthy venture, O'Keefe says, but - for all the wonder so many feel upon witnessing a launch - never one that should see people lose sight of the risk.

""The nature of it just scared me every single time,"" he admits. ""Everybody who talked about shuttle launches that are 'routine' - there is no such thing. Every one of them is an opportunity for disaster, and that's the nature of it.

""But over the course of human history, we have done things that are inherently dangerous because our curiosity gets the better of us.""

For Hubbard, who became chairman of SpaceX's safety panel in 2012, with Elon Musk among those receiving his advice, the lessons learned from Columbia are only growing in importance.

""Space is a hard thing to do, launching humans into space is difficult, and we have been fortunate that thus far there have been relatively few disasters,"" he tells Sky News. (NASA has lost 15 astronauts during spaceflight: seven in Columbia and Challenger, and one, Michael Adams, in a sub-orbital flight in 1967.)

Hubbard says the experience of Columbia ""profoundly changed"" his view of human exploration of space, but our collective ambition to go further, faster, is only going one way.

""Any rocket you send up there, you can't say with any certainty it's going to be just fine,"" says O'Keefe. ""But the alternative is: 'let's not go?' And the answer is, you can't relent to that.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201033805/https://news.sky.com/story/nasa-columbia-disaster-the-investigation-into-one-of-historys-worst-space-tragedies-and-its-lasting-legacy-12796499

Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, told Sky News that the hardest fighting was yet to come and said the next few months would be crucial in deciding the course of the war.

He urged western allies to send more weapons, including Royal Air Force Typhoon jets from the UK and fighter aircraft from other partners.

""Russia is preparing for maximum escalation,"" Mr Danilov said in an interview on Tuesday at his headquarters in the capital Kyiv.

He did not rule out the possibility that President Vladimir Putin attempts another attack from the north, south and east, as happened on 24 February 2022 - maybe even to coincide with the anniversary.

""We will continue to monitor that,"" the western official said in a briefing to journalists.

""Traditionally they [Russia] have tried to do things on dates. The Ukrainians come from a similar culture as well in that regard, but I haven't seen anything from either side to suggest they do have plans afoot.""

Mr Danilov said he expected about half of more than 320,000 soldiers mobilised by Russia last September would be involved in the second wave whenever it came.

The first half of the manpower have already been deployed to Ukraine to replenish Russian lines after Moscow's invading forces suffered significant losses.

Ukraine has also paid a heavy price in military personnel and civilians killed and wounded.

Yet the top security official predicted even bloodier days ahead.

""Of course. We went through an extensive difficult period, but I'm conscious the main fights are yet to come and they will happen this year, within two to three months. These will be defining months in the war,"" Mr Danilov said.

It is why the Ukrainians are desperate for their western partners to send more lethal weapons and faster.

They have secured tanks - belatedly - and are now after fast jets.

""We have our own plans and they are clear to us,"" Mr Danilov said - but they are secret.

""They're not hidden from our main partners: the UK, US and other countries who are helping us. We will follow our plan.""

The ultimate goal is to retake all territory captured by Russian forces - not just since 24 February 2022 but since Russia launched its first invasion of Ukraine back in 2014, capturing the Crimean peninsula and backing so-called separatists in the eastern Donbas region.

1120;Revealed: Which chains put a 'massive' amount of caffeine in their coffees... and which don't;Wednesday 1 February 2023 03:25, UK;[];[];['revealed', 'starbucks', 'massive', 'pret', 'caffeine', 'significantly', 'dont', 'manger', 'costa', 'coffee', 'coffees', 'times', 'contains', 'variations', 'chains'];"A new study has revealed the ""huge"" differences in the amount of caffeine in coffees from leading high street chains like Costa, Starbucks and Pret A Manger.

Which? found that a medium cappuccino at Costa contains a ""massive"" 325mg of caffeine - around the amount contained in four cups of tea and almost five times stronger than a Starbucks cappuccino.

While the variations are not only due to the number of caffeine shots used across the chains, nutritionists say you may be consuming ""significantly more or less caffeine than you bargained for"".

The study found that cappuccinos from Greggs and Pret A Manger contain significantly less caffeine than Costa, at 197mg and 180mg respectively. By comparison, a 250ml can of Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine.

When it comes to a single espresso, one from Starbucks contains a ""meagre"" 33mg of caffeine - meaning at 180mg, one from Pret contains almost six times more.

On filter coffee, Pret A Manger led the way with the most caffeine at 271mg - two-and-a-half times as much as the Starbucks version, which contained 102mg. Greggs was a close second containing 225mg.

The variations are also due to the type of coffee beans used, of which there are two main types - Arabica and Robusta.

Arabica beans contain around half the caffeine of Robusta beans, and there are also variations in taste between the two.

'Big variations in caffeine content'

Which? nutritionist Shefalee Loth said the research shows you may be consuming significantly more, or less, caffeine than you bargained for.

""Our analysis has shown that there are big variations in caffeine content between drinks from different high-street coffee shops.

""Most of the time this shouldn't be an issue but if you drink a lot of coffee or need to limit your caffeine intake you might want to consider what you're ordering and where from.""

The findings also show that buying coffee on the high street could be potentially problematic for consumers who are sensitive to caffeine, or are pregnant.

The NHS says pregnant women should consume no more than 200mg of caffeine per day, advising that a mug of instant coffee contains 100mg and a mug of filter coffee contains 140mg.

A Costa Coffee spokeswoman said: ""The amount of caffeine included within each coffee varies, depending on both the coffee and size of drink ordered by a customer.""

It's alleged the Tate brothers recruited their victims by seducing them and falsely claiming to want a relationship or marriage.

Prosecutors say the women were then forced to produce pornographic content under duress.

Kickboxer turned influencer, Andrew Tate, is also accused of raping one of the victims last March. All four deny the allegations.

Earlier this month, a court extended their preventative custody period to 27 February.

Today, defence teams will try to argue that there is not enough evidence to continue to hold them.

Following the arrests, Romanian authorities said they seized goods and money worth almost £3.25m ($4m) including luxury cars.

Dallas Police said they found the emperor tamarin monkeys after getting a tip that they could be in the Lancaster home, located just south of the zoo.

The zoo alerted police on Monday morning that the white-whiskered pair were missing and that it was ""clear"" the habitat had been ""intentionally compromised"".

No arrests have been made - deepening the mystery at the zoo that has included other cut fences, the escape of a small leopard and the suspicious death of an endangered vulture.

Police said the monkeys were believed to have been taken after someone cut an opening in their enclosure. The monkeys were found in a closet and returned to the zoo for veterinary evaluation.

Detectives are still working to determine whether or not the incidents over the last few weeks are related.

On Tuesday, police released a photo and video of a man they said they wanted to talk to about the monkeys. The photo shows a man eating Doritos while walking, and in the video clip he is seen walking down a path.

The incident was the second time this month that an animal had gone missing at the zoo.

On 13 January, the zoo was closed after workers arrived in the morning and found that a clouded leopard named Nova had gone.

After a search that included police the leopard was found a day later near her habitat. Police said a cutting tool was intentionally used to make the opening in her enclosure.

Just over a week later on 21 January, an endangered lappet-faced vulture named Pin was found dead by workers.

Gregg Hudson, the zoo's president and chief executive, called the death ""very suspicious"" and said the 35-year-old vulture had ""a wound"". but declined to give further details.

Mr Hudson said in a news conference following Pin's death that the vulture enclosure didn't appear to be tampered with. Pin was one of four lappet-faced vultures at the zoo.

In 2004, a 154kg gorilla named Jabari jumped over a wall at Dallas Zoo and went on a 40-minute rampage that injured three people before police shot and killed the animal.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201061354/http://news.sky.com/story/dallas-zoo-mystery-deepens-as-two-missing-monkeys-found-in-closet-at-abandoned-home-12800391

It happened at the Rafter K Rodeo Winter Series at the American Legion Post 290 venue in the city of King on Saturday, officials said.

The rider was named as Denim Bradshaw by event organisers in a Facebook post.

Paramedics were called to the scene following a report of a cardiac arrest. The teenager was taken to hospital where he later died.

His mother, Shannon Bowman, shared her heartbreak in a Facebook post.

""Last night was the longest night of my life!"" she wrote.

""My beautiful handsome 14 year old son had went to be with the lord! I awoke in a nightmare for the rest of my life!""

She added she had ""never seen him so happy as I had seen him last night before his departure"" - and praised him for his bravery and courage.

Amanda Paquette, whose son also took part in the event, told local TV station WFMY News 2 she saw the bull stomp on Denim's chest after he fell.

Event organisers wrote on Facebook: ""Everyone here at Rafter K Rodeo Company, LLC would like to give our sincere condolences to the family and friends of bull rider, Denim Bradshaw.

""Our sport is truly a family and we are so thankful for everyone that was there to help.""

They added: ""This is a tragic event and words cannot describe the pain felt by this loss.""

Denim's sister wrote on a GoFundMe page she set up to help with funeral expenses that it was his first time riding a bull.

She wrote: ""Denim adventured into the world of bull riding and fell in love. The boots, the cowboy hats, and those big belt buckles - he loved it all.

""He got to ride his first bull on January 28th, and his excitement was palpable. None of us could believe that this first ride would cause his death, and we are beyond devastated.

Former prime minister Boris Johnson has called for Western leaders to send fighter jets to Ukraine.

Mr Johnson is currently in the United States drumming up support for Ukraine in the face of the Russian invasion.

He was speaking after the UK and US ruled out sending planes such as the Typhoon, the F-35 or the F-16, to the conflict.

US President Joe Biden has explicitly ruled out shipping F-16s to Volodymyr Zelenskyy's forces.

Speaking to Fox News, Mr Johnson said: ""Every time we have said it will be a mistake to give such and such an item of weaponry, we end up doing it and it ends up being the right thing for Ukraine.""

He said this has been the case with anti-tank missiles, Himars and MLRS rocket launchers, and tanks.

""All I'm saying is save time, save money, save lives. Give the Ukrainians what they need as fast as possible,"" Mr Johnson said.

Asked about the possibility of Vladimir Putin turning the conflict nuclear, Mr Johnson said the Russian president is ""not going to do that"" as the West would put his economy into ""cryogenic paralysis"" that would take decades to recover from.

Adapting to higher temperatures and the more intense heatwaves and storms they are predicted to bring, requires investment of around £10bn a year, says the Climate Change Committee (CCC).

Spending on everything from flood defences, to more heat-resilient homes, to improved drinking water supplies is falling well short of what is needed to insulate the UK from climate impacts, according to the report.

""It is no secret that the UK is now experiencing a range of damaging consequences of climate change, but adaptation in the UK remains chronically underfunded and overlooked. This must change,"" said Baroness Brown, chair of the CCC's Adaptation Committee.

When it comes to reducing the risk of climate change itself through its net zero strategy, the government has been clear in defining priorities, says the report.

The same approach has to be used in adapting to the warming that is inevitable due to global warming that's already under way, it warns.

Key recommendations include improving drainage in urban areas to cope with flooding from extreme rainfall; making more use of ""nature based solutions"" to reduce the risk of flooding from the sea and rivers; and increasing the ability of the public water system to cope with drought, including investment in new reservoirs and ""interconnectors"" between water companies.

The committee also singled out the need to ""climate-proof"" infrastructure like roads and railways and the need to retrofit homes to cope with excess heat.

The Office for National Statistics recently estimated 2,800 excess deaths were linked to heatwaves last summer.

Some actions require direct investment, particularly things like flood defences or tree planting to reduce flood risk, the report finds.

However, many others can be funded by changing planned investments to factor in things like increased temperatures or flood risk, when it comes to improving water supplies, or building new roads, bridges or railways.

""Integrating climate risk into economic and financial decision-making across society is essential for urgently needed investments in our national climate resilience to materialise,"" said Ben Caldecott, a co-author of the report.

A failure to invest now, will ultimately cost more, the report argues.

1133;Ukraine war - latest: Russia hints it will do something to 'gain world's attention' on 24 February;;[];['live', 'russia', 'ukraine'];['west', 'mcfaul', '24', 'attention', 'gain', 'support', 'willing', 'latest', 'russia', 'ukraine', 'worlds', 'big', 'bang', 'putin', 'war', 'hints'];"Would a 'Big Bang' of Western support help Ukraine to win the war?

Positive signs are emerging that the West is willing to provide more, and better, weapons to Ukraine. But with the first anniversary of the conflict fast approaching, there are fears that Ukraine and Russia could remain locked in stalemate over the next year.

Professor Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, has warned in an essay for Foreign Politics that ""incrementally expanding military and economic assistance"" - as the West is doing currently - ""is likely to only prolong the war indefinitely"".

He wrote that Ukraine's allies should start rapidly expanding their weapons deliveries and sanctions on Russia to support a ""breakthrough"" in the conflict.

""Even though Putin must understand by now that Ukrainians are willing to fight for as long as it takes to liberate their country, he still believes that time is on his side. That is because Putin expects Western governments and societies to lose their will and interest to keep helping Ukraine,"" he said.



Professor McFaul said the support should be provided ""swiftly"" - and could even be part of a ""Big Bang"" to mark the anniversary.

""Rather than providing ATACMs in March, Reapers in June, and jets in September, NATO should go for a Big Bang,"" he said.

""Plans to provide all these systems should be announced on February 24, 2023, the first anniversary of Putin's invasion.

""An announcement of this size will produce an important psychological effect inside the Kremlin and Russian society, signaling that the West is committed to Ukraine's ambition to liberate all occupied territories.""

He acknowledged there were risks to providing more support, but said there were also risks to taking no action.

For example, he said fears that Vladimir Putin could escalate the war have so far not come to fruition.

""The reason is simple: Putin has no good way of doing so,"" Mr McFaul said.

""He is already using very expensive cruise missiles to attack apartment buildings. He cannot attack NATO, lest he risk a broader war that Russia would lose quickly. That leaves him with only the nuclear option, but even that would not serve him well.""



He added that if the war drags on for years, many more people will die - and this would be ""the cost of incrementalism"".";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201091201/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russia-aiming-to-degrade-civilian-morale-in-kherson-and-could-we-see-f-16-aircraft-in-skies-over-ukraine-12541713
1134;Enzo Fernandez: Chelsea sign Argentina star for £106.8m, the biggest-ever British transfer fee;Wednesday 1 February 2023 04:13, UK;[];[];['fee', 'sign', 'deal', 'spent', 'window', 'stark', 'star', 'football', 'combined', 'fernandez', 'transfers', 'spending', 'transfer', 'chelsea', 'argentina', 'enzo', 'biggestever', 'british'];"Chelsea have signed Enzo Fernandez for £106.8m - breaking records for Britain's biggest-ever transfer fee.

The Argentinian midfielder played a key role in his country's 2022 World Cup win and scooped the competition's best young player award.

Fernandez, 22, will make the move from Portuguese side Benfica.

The deal breaks the previous record of £100m, paid by Manchester City to Aston Villa for England star Jack Grealish in August 2021.

It means Chelsea have now spent more than £300m on transfers in January, including securing an £88.5m deal for Ukrainian forward Mykhailo Mudryk.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:02 Sky's Rob Harris explains where the cash is from, who’s getting rich and what the spending rules allow.

Fernandez was left out of Benfica's squad for their game against Arouca on Tuesday night - and underwent a medical in Portugal ahead of his switch to Stamford Bridge.

According to Portuguese broadcaster SIC, Fernandez will fly to the UK this morning, with a private jet scheduled to leave Lisbon airport at 10.20am.

Fernandez will help to replace Jorginho, who joined Chelsea's London rivals Arsenal on Deadline Day in a £12m deal.

The financial gulf between English and European football has never been more stark Rob Harris Sports correspondent @RobHarris The football financial gulf between England and the rest of Europe has been stark in the January transfer window. Premier League clubs spent about £650m combined on strengthening squads for the second half of the season. Teams in the next biggest leagues - Spain, Italy, Germany and France - spent less than £200m combined. It's an indicator of the wealth of English football, underpinned by television income (of which Sky News owner Comcast is a large contributor). Splashing the cash so freely reflects the desire for instant success. Particularly at Chelsea. No club has spent more in a year than the Blues - £600m. Half has been splurged in the January window - more than spending in the rest of Europe combined. Read full analysis here

This is the biggest deal in the history of British football - and Chelsea have spent more money on transfers than all the other clubs in the major European leagues put together: Germany, Spain, Italy and France.

1136;Could the dodo be revived? US-based firm Colossal Biosciences announces project to bring back extinct flightless bird;Wednesday 1 February 2023 09:26, UK;[];[];['extinct', 'dodo', 'dna', 'colossal', 'woolly', 'project', 'bird', 'flightless', 'firm', 'scientists', 'usbased', 'combined', 'university', 'bring', 'revived', 'species'];"Scientists hoping to bring extinct species back to life have set their sights on reviving the dodo.

The flightless bird, native to Mauritius, infamously went extinct in the 1600s due to a combination of hunting by sailors and the destruction of its habitats by invasive species brought across to the Indian Ocean island by their ships.

But after more than 400 years since the last recorded sighting of the bird, scientists are hoping to spark a stunning Jurassic Park-style comeback.

US-based firm Colossal Biosciences, which two years ago announced plans to bring back the woolly mammoth, said it now wants to bring back the iconic bird as well.

The firm, based in Dallas, Texas, has already raised an additional $150m (£121m) to support the project.

The company hopes it can recreate the dodo through DNA - much like the fictional experts in the 1993 Steven Spielberg film.

In the Hollywood blockbuster, the scientists combined dinosaur DNA embedded in fossilised mosquitoes in amber combined with frog DNA to bring dinosaurs back to life.

In the real world, experts at Colossal Biosciences hope to take DNA from the dodo's closest living relative, the Nicobar pigeon, and edit them to resemble dodo cells.

It may be possible to put these tweaked cells into developing eggs of other birds, such as pigeons or chickens, to create offspring that may in turn naturally produce dodo eggs, according to Beth Shapiro, a molecular biologist on Colossal's scientific advisory board, who has been studying the dodo for two decades.

The concept is still in an early theoretical stage for dodos.

Ms Shaprio's team now plans to study DNA differences between the Nicobar pigeon and the dodo to understand ""what are the genes that really make a dodo a dodo"".

But Ms Shaprio warned ""it's not possible to recreate a 100% identical copy of something that's gone"".

That is because animals are a product of both their genetics and their environment - which has changed dramatically since the dodo was last sighted in the 1600s.

Other scientists, meanwhile, are sceptical about the idea of the project, warning that ""de-extinction"" efforts divert attention and money away from efforts to save species still on Earth.

Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm said: ""There's a real hazard in saying that if we destroy nature, we can just put it back together again - because we can't.

""And where on Earth would you put a woolly mammoth, other than in a cage?""

The 74-year-old former Black Sabbath singer has had extensive spinal surgery and other treatment over the past four years, after a fall at home in 2019 aggravated injuries he suffered in a near-fatal quad bike crash in 2003.

In 2020, he revealed he has Parkinson's disease.

Osbourne has made a few announcements of gigs being cancelled and rescheduled over the past few years, but has now said he cannot handle the travelling associated with a major tour.

Writing on Instagram, he said: ""This is probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to share with my loyal fans.

""As you may all know, four years ago this month I had a major accident, where I damaged my spine. My one and only purpose during this time has been to get back on stage.""

Osbourne told his five million followers that his singing voice is ""fine"" but his body is ""still physically weak"", despite three operations, stem cell treatments, physical therapy sessions, and recent ""groundbreaking"" Cybernics (HAL) Treatment - using a wearable robot suit.

""I am honestly humbled by the way you've all patiently held on to your tickets for all this time, but in all good conscience I have now come to the realisation that I'm not physically capable of doing my upcoming European/UK tour dates, as I know I couldn't deal with the travel required,"" he said.

According to tour dates on his website, Osbourne was due to begin a series of shows in Helsinki, Finland, on 3 May, with the tour also including gigs in Nottingham, Newcastle, Glasgow, Manchester, Dublin and London, before finishing in his home city of Birmingham on 14 June.

Despite his health problems, Osbourne has appeared at some shows in recent years - including the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in 2022 and at half-time during an NFL game in California in 2021.

While tours can be gruelling, with several shows across short periods of time and lots of travelling involved, Osbourne gave fans hope that live shows won't be off the cards entirely.

""Never would I have imagined that my touring days would have ended this way,"" he said. ""My team is currently coming up with ideas for where I will be able to perform without having to travel from city to city and country to country.""

Ukraine has managed to repair several power units that were damaged in Russian missile attacks – helping to ease the country's electricity shortage.

Russian attacks on energy facilities have led to widespread power shortages and blackouts for millions of people since the war began.

Officials have said about 40% of the system has been damaged as a result.

Why are the repairs important?

But while the power shortage has not been completely fixed, the repairs have improved the situation, meaning blackouts could become less frequent.

""The expected deficit at the evening peak will be about 19% of demand,"" the country's energy ministry said on Telegram.

The power shortage reached 25% at the end of January.

The ministry said warm weather could also help reduce demand on the strained power system.

It added that hostilities in the eastern regions of Donetsk, Kherson and Kharkiv were creating ""the most difficult situation with power outages"".

Her mobile phone was found on a bench nearby and was still connected to a conference call when it was spotted.

Ms Bulley's dog, a springer spaniel called Willow, was found loose between the river and bench.

1140;British Steel draws up plan for 800 job losses amid government funding talks;Wednesday 1 February 2023 12:25, UK;['mark kleinman', '@markkleinmansky'];[];['plan', 'business', 'funding', 'mr', 'production', 'jobs', '800', 'job', 'steel', 'draws', 'talks', 'blast', 'gove', 'losses', 'uk', 'shapps', 'amid', 'british'];"Britain's second-biggest steel producer has been drawing up secret plans to axe hundreds of jobs even as it continues talks with ministers about £300m of taxpayer funding that would partly depend on decade-long employment guarantees.

Sky News has learnt that British Steel has been discussing launching a consultation on around 800 redundancies, principally focused on the Scunthorpe plant in north Lincolnshire where the company is based.

One industry insider said there was a possibility that trade union officials could be briefed on the proposals as early as Wednesday, although there remained a possibility that their disclosure could be delayed pending the outcome of negotiations with the government.

The planned cuts would arise from the closure of coke ovens, although Scunthorpe's two blast furnaces and other mills within the Chinese-owned group would continue to operate, the insider said.

Any redundancy proposals would be certain to draw a sharp response from the government given that its offer of £300m of state support is partly predicated upon providing job guarantees lasting for a decade.

A source suggested job cuts would ""complicate"" the talks between the two sides.

Last week, Sky News revealed that British Steel and larger rival Tata Steel would be required to guarantee thousands of jobs until 2033 in return for £600m of government support to help decarbonise the industry.

Grant Shapps, the business secretary, has told the companies that the proportion of their workforces that would need to be secured would be determined after further discussions.

A six-month moratorium on redundancies is another one of the conditions of the government offer.

The taxpayer funding is to be linked to the replacement of blast furnaces at the company's sites with greener electric arc furnaces.

Jingye Group, British Steel's owner, would be obliged to invest at least £1bn in the business by 2030, with Tata Steel expected to be asked for a similar commitment.

The decision to grant the state aid is not without controversy, given British Steel's Chinese ownership and doubts about its adherence to financial commitments made when it bought the business out of insolvency proceedings in 2020.

In a letter to Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, in December, Grant Shapps and Michael Gove, the levelling-up secretary, warned that British Steel's demise could cost the government up to £1bn in decommissioning and other liabilities.

They cautioned Mr Hunt that British Steel ""does not have a viable business without government support"".

""Closing one blast furnace would be a stepping-stone to closure of the second blast furnace, resulting in a highly unstable business model dependent on Chinese steel imports,"" Mr Shapps and Mr Gove wrote.

""Given the magnitude of the liabilities due to fall on HMG in the event of blast furnace closure, and following the PM's steer, we would like officials to test whether net Government support in the region of £300m for British Steel could prevent closure, protect jobs and create a cleaner viable long-term future for steel production in the United Kingdom.""

They also argued that retaining sovereignty over steel production was critical to the UK economy.

""Every other G20 nation has maintained domestic steel production and, while we do not think that this should come at any cost, we do believe it is in HMG's interest to offer well-designed and targeted funding which unlocks private investment, achieves a good outcome for taxpayers, and enables transformed, decarbonised and viable domestic steel production to continue in the UK in the long-term,"" Mr Shapps and Mr Gove wrote.

""We do not want to become reliant on steel sources elsewhere in the same way that energy security has become self-evidently important.

The fate of British Steel, which was bought by Jingye out of an insolvency process just under three years ago, has become increasingly unclear in recent months as the current owners have indicated that they would not maintain its operations without taxpayer funding.

'A toxic cocktail of factors': Why UK fares so poorly in IMF forecast

British Steel employs about 4,000 people, with thousands more jobs in its supply chain dependent upon the company.

Tata Steel employs substantially more people in the UK, including more than 4,000 at its Port Talbot steelworks in Wales.

According to last month's letter, British Steel had already informed the government that it could close one of the Scunthorpe blast furnaces as soon as next month, with the loss of 1,700 jobs.

This would be ""followed by the second blast furnace closing later in 2023, creating cumulative direct job losses of around 3,000"", Mr Shapps and Mr Gove wrote.

In May 2019, the Official Receiver was appointed to take control of the company after negotiations over an emergency £30m government loan fell apart.

British Steel had been formed in 2016 when India's Tata Steel sold the business for £1 to Greybull Capital, an investment firm.

As part of the deal that secured ownership of British Steel for Jingye, the Chinese group said it would invest £1.2bn in modernising the business during the following decade.

Jingye's purchase of the company, which completed in the spring of 2020, was hailed by Boris Johnson, the then prime minister, as assuring the future of steel production in Britain's industrial heartlands.

Lee Peacock, 50, cut the throats of 46-year-old Sharon Pickles and 59-year-old Clinton Ashmore in London in August 2021.

Peacock, a self-confessed burglar and thief, had only been released from prison in June the same year.

The Old Bailey judge said the 39-year minimum term meant there was a ""strong possibility"" the killer would die in jail.

The murders took place over two days and Peacock tried to cut his own throat after a five-day manhunt led police to a houseboat where he was hiding.

During his trial, he admitted killing the pair but denied it was murder, claiming Ms Pickles' death was an accident and that Mr Ashmore had punched him in the head after he confessed to killing her.

But prosecutors described Peacock's actions as ""cold-blooded"" and ""determined"".

Jurors were told he turned up at his father's property with Ms Pickles' kitten in his rucksack on the evening of 19 August 2021.

His father alerted police and said Peacock had confessed to killing her.

Officers went to Ms Pickles' home in Marylebone, central London, and found her body wrapped up and hidden under a bed, with a signed confession nearby.

In the note, Peacock said that Ms Pickles was ""meant to live"" and he had sworn ""revenge"" against those who took advantage while he was in jail.

Later that day, Peacock was seen on CCTV walking with Mr Ashmore towards his Westminster flat, then leaving alone 15 minutes later.

Mr Ashmore was found dead by friends two hours later. Both victims died from similar knife wounds to the neck.

Peacock and the kitten were tracked down on 25 August and when officers arrived, he tried to turn the knife on himself being restrained.

More notes confessing to the murders and explaining the reasons for them were found in his pocket.

After being treated in hospital, Peacock gave a ""chilling"" account, saying he had used the same knife in both killings and the attempt on his own life.

Giving evidence, Peacock insisted he was ""not a monster"" and he never intended to harm either of his victims.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201123454/http://news.sky.com/story/lee-peacock-sentenced-to-39-years-for-murdering-girlfriend-and-associate-just-weeks-after-release-from-jail-12800643

By Sky News' international affairs editor, Dominic Waghorn.

The US ambassador to NATO has told Sky News a renewed Russian offensive can be expected soon in Ukraine, following predictions from a senior Ukrainian security official that one could come within weeks.



""In terms of a big emboldened move on the part of the Ukrainians or the Russians, I think we can anticipate that when the ground isn’t frozen and when the weather conditions get a bit better,"" said Julianne Smith told Sky News.

The race is on to arm Ukraine with the means to defend itself.

""What the alliance is doing is, individual members of the alliance [are] ensuring we get as much [of] the equipment in the hands of the Ukrainian military as possible so they can be ready for any coming offensive.""

After weeks of hesitation, Germany and America have now agreed to send battle tanks along with European allies.

In the face of claims that delay may cost lives, the ambassador did not rule out them being in use within a few weeks.

""It depends on how fast we can train them up. The one thing that has been unbelievable over the last year has been the Ukrainian military's ability to train up on military equipment and utilise it in real-time.""

And in response to Ukrainian claims Russia may attempt another offensive from the north on the capital Kyiv, ambassador Smith told Sky News it is not likely.

""I don’t think anybody sees that coming at least for now. Right now I suspect they want to hang onto that territory in the east and the south.""

Although intense in places, the pace of fighting in Ukraine has slowed over winter. The ambassador says NATO expects that to go up a gear as spring approaches.

NATO has been accused of arming Ukraine on a piecemeal basis, giving them just enough to continue the war, but not win it.

The alliance will need to prove it can supply enough arms quickly enough to repel any offensive launched by Russia.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201123454/http://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-latest-russia-warns-us-over-missiles-it-is-reportedly-sending-to-ukraine-12541713
1143;Bankside flat owners win privacy case over Tate Modern viewing platform as Supreme Court rules in their favour;Wednesday 1 February 2023 11:23, UK;[];[];['privacy', 'platform', 'solution', 'tate', 'win', 'viewing', 'court', 'rules', 'gallery', 'modern', 'flat', 'residents', 'owners', 'public', 'supreme'];"Owners of four luxury flats overlooked by the Tate Modern's public viewing platform have won their long-running privacy case at the Supreme Court.

Neo Bankside residents said ""hundreds of thousands"" of visitors to the world-famous London gallery were looking into their homes in a ""relentless"" invasion of privacy.

They wanted the gallery to cordon off parts of the platform or put up screens.

The High Court and Court of Appeal sided with the gallery, but the residents took the case to the Supreme Court and on Wednesday it ruled 3-2 in their favour.

It said a viewing gallery was not a ""normal"" use of the gallery's land and that it was a legal ""nuisance"" to the flat owners who couldn't properly enjoy their property.

The properties have floor-to-ceiling windows and the Supreme Court's Lord Leggatt likened it to ""being on display in a zoo"".

""Inviting members of the public to look out from a viewing gallery is manifestly a very particular and exceptional use of land,"" he said.

""It cannot even be said to be a necessary or ordinary incident of operating an art museum.""

Shortly after the platform opened in 2016, the gallery's former boss suggested owners simply put up blinds or curtains and claimed people buying flats were aware the platform was due to open.

But Lord Leggatt said residents ""cannot be obliged to live behind net curtains or with their blinds drawn all day"" to protect themselves from prying eyes.

He also said the Court of Appeal had made legal errors when dismissing a bid for injunction and damages.

Flats in the block - situated next to the Thames on the South Bank - go for a premium price, with a three-bed currently on the market for £3.4m.

Nearly six years after the claim began, it will now go back to the High Court to find a solution for the flat owners.

Pakistan's economic woes are a culmination of years of political turmoil, a financial crisis and last year's catastrophic floods, with its reserves only able to cover three weeks - rather than the required three months.

Inflation is also thought to stand at around 24% to 26%, according to the country's finance ministry, and the currency has been devalued against the dollar.

Pakistan left without power after energy-saving move backfires

The IMF delegation will be encouraging the Pakistani government to implement bold cost-cutting measures to help it bridge its financial gap, with mission chief Nathan Porter saying: ""You don't have any other option.""

In 2019, Pakistan secured a $6bn (£4.9bn) bailout from the IMF. It got another $1bn (£811m) last year to help overcome the devastating floods, but in November the IMF suspended payments, saying the government failed to make progress on its fiscal consolidation.

In response, Ishaq Dar, the country's finance minister, told the IMF it had made some efforts to bring its crisis under control, including increasing taxes on petrol and natural gas, and increased prices for electricity.

If released, the cash from the IMF would go towards paying its external debt to the tune of $8bn, which has to be paid by the end of June.

Backlogs at ports, factories closed and electricity blackouts

The government has stopped issuing lines of credit, causing a backlog of container ships at the port of Karachi, while industry has been battered by the currency devaluation and imports block.

Domestic investment has dried up, with textile factories partially closing due to demand, and construction projects have been delayed due to lack of investment.

There has also been severe energy shortages, which has hindered remaining economic activity, while companies that generate and supply energy struggle with the high costs of fuel and turn off the electricity grid to save money.

Last week the country of 243 million people was plunged into darkness after a major breakdown of the national grid, which lasted several hours - the impact was felt on schools, hospitals, businesses and industry further hindering economic activity.

The country's economy has been faltering for many years, with the floods in 2022 pushing it over the edge.

Pakistan's floods impacted a third of the country and wiped out millions of hectares of crops. Almost 2,000 people were killed, and around 33 million people were displaced, with damage thought to cost around $40bn (£32.4bn).

Successive governments have been accused of making little effort to widening the tax net and increasing sources of revenue, while loans from allies such as China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates kept its economy afloat.

Some blame former PM Imran Khan

Former prime minister Imran Khan, and his government, have been accused of contributing to the immediate crisis. A year into his premiership, the fiscal deficit shot to a record high of $25.3bn (£20.5bn) and by the time he was ousted early last year, inflation was over 12%.

Mr Khan delayed approaching the IMF, despite economists recommending it, saying he wants to shun the practice of approaching foreign entities with a ""begging bowl"".

However, his government was unable to bear the costs of a slew of welfare schemes it rolled out - though it helped his popularity.

His government's reluctance to increase fuel costs, even in early 2022 when international crude rates had breached the $100 mark due to the war in Ukraine war, meant the state exchequer lost precious dollars.

Is Pakistan going the same way as Sri Lanka?

There is comparison of what is taking place in Pakistan with the collapse of the Sri Lankan economy last year.

But this is unlikely, as almost half of Sri Lanka's external debt was owed to private creditors while for Pakistan, this is only about 8% of what it owes.

Pakistan's large bilateral loan payments are to friendly countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and China, which will be rolled over.

With the present government starting to implement changes that would satisfy the IMF and a release of the $1.1bn tranche, this will pave the way for the release of the loan and other bilateral assistances.

The five month fall makes it the longest period of consecutive falls since February 2009, according to economic research company Pantheon Macroeconomics.

House price data from Nationwide building society showed the monthly price decline was greater than expected as economists had forecast a 0.3% fall.

Mortgage approvals at lowest level since early months of pandemic

Prices are now 3.2% below the high seen in August when the average house cost £273,71.

The cost has come down by roughly £20,000 and last month the average house was £258,297 - a further decrease from £262,068 in December.

The figures come as the Bank of England data showed mortgage approvals continued to drop. The Bank figures showed demand for mortgages fell to the lowest level since the early days of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in December.

But house prices are still growing in the year overall, just at a slower pace. Annual house price growth slowed to 1.1%, down from 2.8% in December.

""The heady days of the pandemic race for space feel like a lifetime away and it won't be long until we see house price growth going backwards,"" Helen Morrissey said.

Pantheon Macroeconomics estimate the drop from the peak will reach 8%.

Would-be home owners face an uphill battle, the Nationwide data showed. The cost of living crisis, driven by double digit inflation has made saving for a deposit a difficult task.

The problem is particularly hard for those in the private rental sector, Nationwide's chief economist said.

""Saving for a deposit is proving a struggle for many given the rising cost of living, especially those in the private rented sector where rents have been rising at their strongest pace on record,"" Robert Gardner said.

""High house prices relative to earnings mean deposit requirements remain a major challenge. Moreover, the help to buy equity loan scheme that helped those with a smaller deposit buy a new build property is due to end in March.""

""Affordability pressures remain particularly acute in London and the south of England, where mortgage servicing costs have risen sharply compared with a year ago,"" Mr Gardner said.

The organisation launched an investigation just three days on from announcing the 2023 Oscars shortlists, after Riseborough's surprise nod for her performance in To Leslie led to much discussion about campaigning.

Academy bosses said they wanted to ensure no guidelines had been violated this year.

While many film studios spend millions on their awards season campaigns, indie film To Leslie relied on a small budget and word of mouth to get noticed.

Riseborough's nomination came after some very public backing from stars including Kate Winslet, Jennifer Aniston, Edward Norton and Cate Blanchett - who is now up for the Oscar alongside the British actress.

Following the review, the Academy released a statement on behalf of chief executive Bill Kramer, saying ""social media and outreach campaigning tactics"" used by the film had ""caused concern"".

""Based on concerns that surfaced last week around the To Leslie awards campaign, the Academy began a review into the film's campaigning tactics,"" the statement read.

Riseborough's performance in To Leslie has been praised by critics, but before the Oscars she had not been nominated for any major awards.

Neo Bankside residents said ""hundreds of thousands"" of visitors to the world-famous London gallery were looking into their homes in a ""relentless"" invasion of privacy.

They wanted the gallery to cordon off parts of the platform or put up screens.

The High Court and Court of Appeal sided with the gallery, but the residents took the case to the Supreme Court and on Wednesday it ruled 3-2 in their favour.

It said a viewing gallery was not a normal use of the gallery's land and that it was a legal ""nuisance"" to the flat owners who couldn't properly enjoy their property.

The properties have floor-to-ceiling windows and the Supreme Court's Lord Leggatt likened it to ""being on display in a zoo"".

""Inviting members of the public to look out from a viewing gallery is manifestly a very particular and exceptional use of land,"" he said.

""It cannot even be said to be a necessary or ordinary incident of operating an art museum.""

Shortly after the platform opened in 2016, the gallery's former boss suggested owners simply put up blinds or curtains and claimed people buying flats were aware the platform was due to open.

Mohamed El Abboud, 28, and Kusai Al-Jundi, 25, targeted trusting mother-of-two Louise Kam, who had previously owned a catering business with her ex-husband before going into rental properties.

Al-Jundi, a chef from, north-west London, spent months attempting to trick Ms Kam, from Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, into giving him control of two properties she owned in Willesden and East Barnet by offering her millions of pounds.

He also aimed to gain control of her finances by convincing her to sign a Lasting Power of Attorney document.

But the scam came to a head when Ms Kam made it clear she would not sign over the properties.

The pair then lured her to her three-bedroom property in Barnet on 26 July last year. There she was strangled with a hairdryer cord during a ""violent struggle"".

Her body was then wrapped up in a duvet, dumped in a wheelie bin and covered with garden rubbish.

The following day the pair moved the bin to a road in Harrow where they lined it up with other bins showing the same number on the front in what the court heard was a plot to ""cover up"" the pair's ""atrocity"".

Image: A photo issued by Metropolitan Police of the wheelie bin where the body of Louise Kam was found

El Abboud and Al-Jundi were convicted at the Old Bailey on 19 January after officers untangled their lies and found evidence linking them to her murder.

On Wednesday the pair were both sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 35 years years, by Judge Mark Lucraft KC, who said the murder of Ms Kam was motivated ""by greed"".

Phone used to pretend victim was still alive

Ms Kam, from Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, was last seen by a family member near the Spires Shopping Centre in Barnet on 26 July 2021.

She was reported missing to police the following day and an investigation was launched to find her.

Her black BMW was recovered by police on 28 July in Edgware. Her body was discovered on 1 August 2021 in a wheelie bin on Wood End Road, Harrow.

Investigators said the following day Al-Jundi sent Ms Kam's family and friends messages pretending she was alive and that she had gone on holiday.

On the same day El-Abboud sold Ms Kam's BMW and bought new clothes with the proceeds.

He also posted a TikTok video of him dancing and gyrating to music in the driveway of her Barnet home.

The judge had told how Al-Jundi had been described as a Walter Mitty character who falsely claimed to be a ""person of means"" with the backing of a multi-millionaire girlfriend when he set about tricking Ms Kam out of her property.

Having resolved to murder her to get hold of her assets, he promised El-Abboud a share ""as a reward for killing her"", the judge said.

Motivated by 'greed'

In sentencing both to life in prison, with a minimum term of 35 years, Judge Mark Lucraft KC said: ""El-Abboud, it might be said that Al-Jundi played the lead role in the long-running defrauding of Louise, but I draw no distinction on the sentence to be passed on the two of you.

""The evidence clearly shows what you did and did willingly and that you, along with Al-Jundi, did what you did out of greed.""

Catherine Gould, prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""This horrific crime is a tale of greed taken to extremes. Al-Jundi and El-Abboud selfishly and brutally ended Louise Kam's life for their own ends.

""These defendants hatched a plan to kill Louise and profit from her death.""

In a victim impact statement, Ms Kam's son Gregory Kam said the family had been left in a state of ""disbelief"" at what happened to his mother.

He said: ""I deeply regret I was not able to do enough at the time to prevent my mother from falling for the lies of his wolf in sheep's clothing.

""In addition to the initial shocking news of our mother's disappearance and subsequent news of her murder, I was not only shocked but further angered and sickened to discover defendant one (Al-Jundi) enlisted the help of an accomplice (El-Abboud) to trick, entrap, overpower and murder a pension-age woman in her own home under the guise of what was supposed to be a business deal.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201124930/http://news.sky.com/story/louise-kam-two-men-jailed-for-murder-and-fraud-plot-12800016

Football officials Australia and New Zealand said they were disappointed not to be consulted about the deal with Visit Saudi by FIFA before reports emerged.

They have written to the world governing body seeking urgent clarification.

Human rights group Amnesty International urged FIFA to speak out on the need for more human rights reforms in Saudi Arabia rather than allowing its showpiece women's tournament to be used for ""sportswashing"" the country's image and for the exploitation of players.

Sportswashing relates to enhancing the reputation of a controversial country or an organisation by using sport sponsorship.

The tournament, which has been expanded from 24 to 32 teams for this edition, opens in July with European champions England trying to win their first Women's World Cup.

Football Australia said it ""understands FIFA has entered into a destination partnership agreement"" for the tournament.

The organisation added in a statement: ""We are very disappointed that Football Australia were not consulted on this matter prior to any decision being made.

""Football Australia and New Zealand Football have jointly written to FIFA to urgently clarify the situation.""

Separately, New Zealand Football said ""we are shocked and disappointed"" to hear the reports about the sponsorship.

Amnesty International said it is concerned about what it calls a ""rolling crackdown on human rights"" under crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Felix Jakens, Amnesty International UK's Head of Priority Campaigns and Individuals at Risk, said: ""FIFA should speak out about the need for human rights reform in Saudi Arabia and not merely allow its premier women's tournament to be used for sportswashing.

""Players, coaches and fans should likewise challenge this crude exploitation of their sport by Saudi Arabia.""

FIFA had no immediate comment. There was no response from the Saudi government.

Jakens added: ""Women in Saudi Arabia face serious discrimination in marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody rights, while Saudi women who've dared to speak out about the need for reforms in the country have received massive jail sentences.""

Saudi Arabia is increasingly using the allure of sport as a soft power push to clean up its image after criticism of human rights violations and ongoing concern about the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi after he entered the consulate in Istanbul.

One of the world's biggest footballers - Cristiano Ronaldo - has just made his debut for Saudi club Al-Nassr after a lucrative financial package was offered.

The Saudi sovereign wealth fund bought Newcastle in 2021 and the club has just reached its first cup final this century after success in the League Cup semi-finals this week.

The Public Investment Fund has also shaken up golf by launching the breakaway LIV Series that has attracted some of the game's leading stars.

Saudi Arabia is also considering a 2030 men's World Cup bid alongside Egypt and Greece.

Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse, who goes by Nathan Chasing Horse, allegedly committed the offences across a period spanning two decades, according to police records.

He is also believed to be the leader of a cult known as The Circle, according to a 50-page search warrant, obtained by the AP news agency.

The 46-year-old actor, best known for his role as the young Sioux tribe member Smiles A Lot in the 1999 Kevin Costner film, was arrested near the North Las Vegas home he is said to share with his five wives.

A police SWAT unit was seen outside the property on Tuesday evening as detectives searched inside.

Following his appearance in Dances With Wolves, Chasing Horse gained a reputation among tribes across the United States and in Canada as a so-called medicine man who performed healing ceremonies and spiritual gatherings.

Police allege that he used his position to abuse young Native American girls.

According to the warrant, Las Vegas police have identified at least six alleged victims and uncovered sexual allegations against Chasing Horse.

The allegations date back to the early 2000s in multiple states, including Montana, South Dakota and Nevada, where he has lived for about a decade.

Although the warrant includes details of crimes reported elsewhere, the arrest stems from crimes allegedly committed in Nevada's Clark County.

They include sex trafficking, sexual assault of a child younger than 16 and child abuse, while some of the alleged victims were as young as 13, according to the warrant.

One of Chasing Horse's wives was allegedly offered to him as a ""gift"" when she was 15, while another became a wife after turning 16.

Chasing Horse is also accused of recording sexual assaults and arranging sex with the victims for other men who allegedly paid him.

Ian Byrne, the Labour MP for West Derby in Liverpool, is now asking an urgent question on the national police response to a Hillsborough families report that was published yesterday.



Police pledged reforms in reply to the former bishop of Liverpool, whose report five years ago made recommendations to ensure the suffering of the Hillsborough families is never repeated.



The government has been criticised for not offering its own formal response to the findings and Mr Byrne asks when the Home office will do this.

Policing minister Chris Philp said the government is committed to engaging with Hillsborough families before publishing their response, but that he has asked for this to be sped up and is ""expecting it to come out in the course of this Spring"".

Mr Byrne says it is ""shameful"" the government has not issued a formal response yet and the police response yesterday was ""far too little and far too late"".

Among the changes police pledged is a Charter For Families Bereaved Through Public Tragedy, which commits police leaders to acknowledge any mistakes and ensure ""care, compassion, openness, transparency and accountability"".



However, families of the 97 who died in the 1989 stadium crush want a law that creates a statuary duty for police officers to tell the truth and comply with investigations.

Mr Byrne asked policing minister Chris Philip if the government will ""do the right thing"" and implement the Hillsborough Law"" - as Labour have done - with ""immediate effect"".

Police were called to a house in the Broadlands area at about 5pm on Tuesday, but Alice died at the scene shortly after.

The dog was put down and no one else was hurt. There have been no arrests.

Police Superintendent Matt Bullivant called it an ""absolutely tragic incident"" and said people should not speculate about the circumstances.

Neighbour Rita Matthews, 36, said she would often see Alice while walking her own daughter to school.

""She was always holding her mummy's hand on the way back,"" she said.

""It's so sad we're not going to see the girl again and I pray all the best to her mum to get her strength back.""

She said Alice was a ""happy little girl, very happy"".

""She would say 'Bye, auntie', and I would say 'Bye, little girl',"" said Ms Matthews.

Police confirmed the dog had been humanely put down ""to ensure public safety"".

The end-of-terrace house was still cordoned off on Wednesday, with a forensic tent by the garden and officers on the street.

During Prime Minister's Questions, Rishi Sunak sent his condolences to Alice's family and the community.

Donna Fuller, a ward councillor for Woughton Community Council, said a vigil would be held this evening.

A statement from Bob Bauer, personal attorney for the President, read: ""Today, with the President's full support and cooperation, the DOJ is conducting a planned search of his home in Rehoboth, Delaware.

""Under DOJ's standard procedures, in the interests of operational security and integrity, it sought to do this work without advance public notice, and we agreed to cooperate.

""The search today is a further step in a thorough and timely DOJ process we will continue to fully support and facilitate. We will have further information at the conclusion of today's search.""

The FBI has yet to comment on the search.

It comes after Mr Biden's lawyer last month confirmed that six further documents containing classification markings were found at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware.

Previously, Mr Biden's legal team acknowledged it had found classified documents relating to his time as vice-president in the Obama administration at his home, including some in his garage.

Aides previously found another batch of classified documents at a Washington think-tank he was associated with.

The apparent mishandling of classified documents and official records from the Obama administration is under investigation by a former US attorney, Robert Hur, who was appointed as a special counsel in January by Attorney General Merrick Garland.

Republicans have sought to compare the investigation of Mr Biden's handling of classified documents to the ongoing probe into how former president Donald Trump handled classified documents after his presidency.

The White House, however, says the two cases are different because Biden's team has cooperated with authorities in their probe and turned over documents.

Mr Trump had resisted doing so until an FBI search at his Florida home.

A special counsel will also review Trump's handling of classified documents.

The DOJ historically imposes a high legal bar before bringing criminal charges in cases involving the mishandling of classified information, with a requirement that someone intended to break the law as opposed to being merely careless or negligent in doing so.

The National Archives has reportedly asked all former U.S. presidents and vice presidents to search their personal records for classified documents or other presidential material that should have been turned over when they left office.

Warning: This story contains graphic content and details of alleged sexual abuse

In video evidence shown to jurors, a primary school-aged child claimed they never saw two-year-old Jellica Burke again after the game with 52-year-old Andrew Innes.

Innes denies murdering Jellica and her mother Bennylyn Burke, 25, and has instead lodged a special defence of diminished responsibility.

Innes is currently on trial for murder at the High Court in Edinburgh.

The child giving evidence, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed Innes ""pretended"" Jellica was hiding but had ""killed"" her.

Image: Jellica Burke was two years old

The child believed the alleged killing happened in the bathroom as Innes shut her out of the room.

A joint minute of agreed evidence between prosecutors and the defence team was read out to a jury at the start of the trial.

It was accepted that Innes stabbed Ms Burke on the body with a knife as well as repeatedly striking her on the head with a hammer and the handle of the blade.

It was also accepted that Innes asphyxiated Jellica before burying both bodies under the kitchen floor of his property.

Innes denies further charges of abducting and raping the primary school-aged child and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.

The court was closed to the public while video evidence recorded with the alleged rape victim was played to the jury.

The child described sexual acts they reportedly had been told to carry out by Innes and claimed they were paid money after each alleged assault.

The child told the court that Innes even presented them with a purse to keep their 'savings' in. They claimed that Innes also used handcuffs on them, describing that it felt ""terrible"".

Forensic scientist Barry Mitchell later took to the stand and said that Innes's DNA was found on the child's pyjama bottoms.

He said the child and Ms Burke's DNA were also found on Innes's dressing gown.

All of the alleged incidents are said to have taken place at Innes's house in Troon Avenue, Dundee, between 20 February and 5 March 2021.

Earlier this week, the court heard that Mrs Burke, originally from the Philippines, had lived in Bristol after marrying Lexington Burke, 65, in August 2019. Their relationship later broke down.

Ms Burke and Innes were then said to have met via an online dating site. Innes reportedly confirmed to police that Ms Burke had travelled from Bristol to Dundee with him.

While giving evidence, PC Gavin Burns, 33, told the court that Innes admitted killing Ms Burke when Police Scotland officers visited his home as part of a high-risk missing persons inquiry.

After again being challenged by PC Burns on Ms Burke's whereabouts, Innes reportedly confessed: ""I killed her, she's under the floor. We got into a fight and I killed her.""

He then reportedly queried what the jail sentence was for murder, before allegedly adding: ""It wasn't premeditated.""

Ms Johnson added: ""I was wrong to use the term fascist in relation to the Israeli government and understand why this was particularly insensitive given the history of the state of Israel.

""And while there are far-right elements in the government I recognise that the use of the term in this context was wrong.""

Tensions have been rising between Israel and the Palestinians in recent weeks, with escalating violence in the region.

US secretary of state Antony Blinken arrived in the country earlier this week and appealed to ""everyone to take steps to calm tensions rather than inflame them"".

Labour grandee Dame Margaret Hodge called Ms Johnson's language ""unacceptable and dangerous"", adding: ""With violence escalating in recent weeks, this careless remark only makes it harder to bridge the divide.""

As a result, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest NFL players of all time.

Spire Healthcare, which runs private hospitals, announced the move after revisiting ""historic legacy IT systems"" which had been thought to be ""inaccessible"".

Solicitors who have represented hundreds of Paterson's clients asked how so many people had been missed off earlier recalls ""due to a computer glitch"".

Paterson was jailed for 20 years in 2017 for 17 counts of wounding people with intent.

He subjected more than 1,000 patients to unnecessary and damaging operations over 14 years.

A 2020 independent inquiry ruled he was free to perform harmful surgery in NHS and private hospitals because of ""a culture of avoidance and denial"".

The inquiry said all 11,000 patients Paterson treated should be recalled for review.

Between 1997 and 2011, Paterson is known to have treated thousands of patients at Spire Parkway hospital and Spire Little Aston hospital in the West Midlands.

This was alongside his work at NHS hospitals run by the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust.

In a statement, Spire said further checks were carried out to be ""certain that there were no outstanding patients who might require support, dating back to the earliest years of his practice"".

It added: ""To do this, (Spire) revisited historic legacy IT systems, in use between 1993 and the early 2000s, containing information about patients from over 20 years ago which had been thought to be inaccessible.

""However, following a further complex analysis of these legacy systems, Spire was able to identify the details of around 1,500 patients.""

Dr Cathy Cale, Spire's group medical director, said: ""We are very sorry for the significant distress and harm suffered by patients who were treated by Ian Paterson.

""We accepted the recommendations of the independent inquiry into Paterson in 2020 and are fully committed to implementing them.""

'Recall will bring back bitter memories'

Linda Millband, head of clinical negligence at Thompsons Solicitors, which has represented hundreds of Paterson's clients, said: ""The fact that 1,500 patients could have been missed off both previous recalls shows how extensively Spire enabled Paterson to practice.

The Instagram users, both aged in their 20s, were arrested on 1 November after the video of them dancing at the Azadi Tower went viral.

The news agency of Human Rights Activists (HRANA) said they were both jailed for 10 years and six months for ""promotion of impurity and indecency, assembly and collusion against national security, and propaganda against the regime"".

In defiance of the country's strict rules, Ms Haghighi was not wearing a headscarf in the video while women are forbidden from dancing in public.

HRANA said a source had revealed the couple had been denied a lawyer during the proceedings at a revolutionary court in Tehran.

Ms Haghighi is also said to have been relocated to Qarchak Prison, in Varamin, where the conditions come under regular criticism by campaigners.

October alone saw £629m taken - the most recorded in a single month.

It helped the overall year dwarf 2021's previous high of £2.7bn, although the total number of hacks fell slightly.

The annual report by Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm which sees its data used by governments, banks, and businesses worldwide, says the activity was largely driven by hackers based in North Korea.

Kim Jong Un's regime has repeatedly been accused of hacking cryptocurrencies to make money and evade international sanctions, even using stolen digital assets to fund its missile programme.

In 2022, Chainalysis says hackers associated with Pyongyang - notably criminal syndicate Lazarus Group - stole an estimated £1.4bn in cryptocurrency assets, breaking their own record.

Researchers have previously linked the group to the regime, though it is not known whether it is part of the government's own operations or an external hire.

The amount of crypto thought to have been stolen hugely outweighs North Korea's total annual exports, which latest figures from the Observatory of Economic Complexity put at £115m for 2020.

""It isn't a stretch to say that cryptocurrency hacking is a sizable chunk of the nation's economy,"" said Chainalysis.

Where was the money stolen from?

The biggest victims of crypto hacks in 2022 were within decentralised finance protocols, which is essentially when investors cut out the middle man - like a bank or exchange - and transfer funds directly between digital wallets.

It's becoming increasingly popular as it's considered more transparent, which people are placing more value in following the collapse of major crypto platform FTX.

But according to Chainalysis, these so-called DeFi protocols made up 82.1% of crypto stolen by hackers in 2022, totalling more than £2.5bn.

David Schwed, of blockchain security company Halborn, said DeFi developers should not be afraid of looking to traditional centralised systems for inspiration in making themselves safer to use.

""You don't need to move as slow as a bank, but you can borrow from what banks do,"" he said.

The report comes as the UK government unveils proposals to regulate crypto, as the market seeks to regain the confidence of investors spooked by an exceptionally volatile period.

Under the plans, which would bring the industry more in line with traditional financial systems, crypto platforms would become responsible for defining the demands that a currency must meet before being admitted for trading.

Exchanges will also be held accountable for safely facilitating transactions and keeping customer assets safe.

Jordan Wain, UK public policy lead at Chainalysis, told Sky News the regulation was welcome.

""It is encouraging to see the prominent thread of consumer protection running through these plans, which evidence a clear intent to tackle potentially abusive behaviours,"" he said.

But he warned that tougher rules must not harm the industry's ""potential for innovation and growth"".

Decades before the infamous Salem witch trials in Massachusetts, Alse Young on 26 May 1647 became the first person on record to be executed in the American colonies for witchcraft.

She was the first of nine women and two men executed in Connecticut for witchcraft over a 15-year period, during which more than 40 people faced trial for having ties to Satan.

The Windsor town clerk registered her death in a diary entry that read: ""Alse Young was hanged.""

Now, activists including amateur historians, researchers and descendants of the accused witches and their accusers hope state legislators will finally offer posthumous exonerations.

Connecticut state senator Saud Anwar and state representative Jane Garibay have proposed resolutions to officially exonerate the state's witch trial victims.

Ms Garibay, who received letters from eighth and ninth-generation relatives of accused witches, said: ""They're talking about how this has followed their families from generation to generation, and that they would love for someone just to say, 'Hey, this was wrong'. And to me, that's an easy thing to do if it gives people peace.""

Mr Anwar said he expects some people might laugh or scoff at the campaign, but added families are feeling some ""serious stuff"", including a constituent who urged him to take action.

""His wish was that if there was a way to give some kind of a closure to the families... That would be one way for him to be able to say that he has done his share, even though his ancestors may have not done the right thing,"" said Mr Anwar.

Other states and countries have attempted to atone for a history of persecuting people as witches.

Last year, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a formal apology to around 4,000 Scots, mostly women, who were accused of witchcraft up until 1736.

Politicians in Massachusetts in 2022 formally exonerated Elizabeth Johnson Jr who was convicted of witchcraft in 1693 and sentenced to death.

In 2006, former Virginia governor Tim Kaine gave an informal pardon to Grace Sherwood. The widowed midwife was blamed by neighbours for ruining crops, killing livestock and creating storms and subsequently accused of being a witch.

She was thrown into a river to see if she floated, which was purported to indicate guilt.

The government's 2% pay offer to civil servants has been described as a ""slap in the face"" by a worker for the police watchdog.

Speaking anonymously, the Independent Office for Police Conduct civil servant said: ""It is important for all of us to support those on the lowest salaries.

""If you had said 12 years ago that we would be in this state, no-one would have believed you.

""This (2% offer) has been the straw that broke the camel's back.

""If you work for a smaller agency, or one which is less visible to the public, it is easier to offer miserly pay rises than if you are slightly more public-facing like a nurse or a train driver.

""Two per cent is just a slap in the face.""



Meanwhile, a 34-year-old who works for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was clear the government thought they would ""just take"" the pay rise.

He said: ""We got the lowest pay rise in the public sector because they thought they could just do this to us and we would just take it.

""I believe more people will come out. So many people who had not been part of unions before and had not been striking before are stepping out and being open about striking.""

1174;Revealed: How Netflix plans to stop you sharing your password;Wednesday 1 February 2023 11:37, UK;[];['netflix'];['revealed', 'phone', 'account', 'sharing', 'using', 'streaming', 'dont', 'netflix', 'stop', 'plans', 'device', 'password', 'devices'];"Netflix's impending crackdown on password sharing includes plans to force users to regularly connect via their home Wi-Fi.

An update to the streaming giant's help page reveals details of how the company will finally take a tougher stance against the practice, which millions of people in the UK are estimated to partake in.

While logins will still be shareable within a single home, Netflix has outlined new measures to ensure that any device which uses the account is associated with the account holder's primary location.

Who will I be able to share my account with?

People within your home can still use your account - so if mum or dad are paying, but the kids are still at home, they can have their own profiles and watch Netflix on their own devices as they do now.

But if the kids have gone to university or moved out, maintaining access to their parents' Netflix will get trickier.

That's because by using information such as IP addresses, device IDs, and account activity, the company can detect where users are logging in from and may choose to intervene if they suspect a case of freeloading.

How is this going to be enforced?

Netflix will treat devices which use your account as trusted if they are connected to your home Wi-Fi regularly.

Advertisement

So don't worry, you can of course still take your Netflix account with you on your phone when you go out, assuming that you bring it back home with you and log in there at least once every 31 days.

But if a device from outside your household signs in or is used persistently, Netflix says it may ask you to verify that device before it can be used to watch anything.

How streaming services could change in 2023

What sort of verification?

Netflix says it will send a link to the email address or phone number associated with the primary account holder, containing a four-digit code that will need to be entered on the untrusted device within 15 minutes.

This ""may be required periodically"".

And this will also be needed of you if you are away from your home for an extended period of time, for example if you take your phone travelling and plan to keep using Netflix.

So I can still share my account?

Technically, yes, it's just becoming a lot more inconvenient, riskier, and could end up costing you.

Firstly, don't forget Netflix limits how many devices can be using one account simultaneously depending on which pricing tier you're on, and it maxes out at four at £15.99 per month.

Even if the prospect of constant verification code messages or someone swinging by to use your Wi-Fi isn't inconvenient enough, Netflix may still act if it suspects blatant password sharing is going on.

Those who are logging in from outside the household will either have to pay up for their own account, or the original account holder will need to spend a little extra.

Netflix has been trialling a feature to let people add subaccounts for up to two people they don't live with. It's been testing in parts of South America since last year and costs the equivalent of an extra £2-£3 a month.

Why is Netflix doing this?

Netflix started talking tough on a potential password sharing crackdown during a lull in subscriber numbers.

With more competition from the likes of Disney+ and Amazon Prime, and the cost of living crisis, the company was looking for ways to reverse the trend and boost revenue.

It started trying to tempt account sharers to make the move of their own accord last year, by letting people transfer profiles from one account to another.

The Intellectual Property Office has since ruled that password sharers are breaking copyright law - it's just down to the streaming services themselves to enforce it.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201153119/http://news.sky.com/story/revealed-how-netflix-plans-to-stop-you-sharing-your-password-12800510
1175;Politics news latest: Downing Street's defence of Dominic Raab coming under scrutiny - as Labour focus on sleaze amid evidence of 'cut through' with public;;[];[];['evidence', 'prime', 'jets', 'labour', 'mr', 'sleaze', 'johnson', 'support', 'focus', 'politics', 'public', 'putin', 'scrutiny', 'streets', 'minister', 'raab', 'fighter', 'latest', 'ukraine', 'uk'];"Johnson says it would be 'game over' for Putin if Ukraine takes back land bridge

Former prime minister Boris Johnson is currently in the US.

He is stateside as part of a push to maintain the West's support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's invasion.

The ex-PM has been speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington DC, this afternoon.

Mr Johnson said there is ""no conceivable grounds for delay"" from Western countries - days after Germany was criticised by some for appearing slow to decide on providing tanks to Ukraine.

Western allies should ""give the Ukrainians the support they need to finish this war"", Mr Johnson said, adding: ""Let's give them those tools now.""

He added that if Ukraine is able to take back the strip of land in southern Ukraine between Mariupol, the Donbas and Crimea, this will help to end the war.



""If they can take back Melitopol and Berdiansk and Mariupol, get back those areas, it's game over for Putin,"" he said.

Returning to his arguments later in the discussion, he said it would be a ""false economy to let Putin win"".

This, he said, would be ""burdening future generations with the massive expense of trying to protect the whole area"".

We reported earlier on comments from Mr Johnson to Fox News in the US, with the former PM calling for Western leaders to send fighter jets to Ukraine.

Downing Street has said Mr Johnson's visit to Washington was ""not on behalf of the UK government"" and has distanced itself from the former leader's comments on fighter jets.

Mr Sunak's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister welcomes all colleagues' backing for Ukraine and is pleased the former prime minister is continuing his staunch support of the United Kingdom's efforts to help Ukraine secure a lasting peace.""

But he said Mr Johnson is ""acting in his own capacity"".

On the possibility of sending jets, the official said: ""It's currently not practical to send UK jets.

""We will continue to work closely with the Ukrainians to understand their needs and how allies can further support them.

""Given the complexity of UK fighter jets and the length of time required to train them, we do not currently think it is practical to do so.""

Downing Street said the RAF's Typhoons and F-35s are ""extremely sophisticated"" pieces of equipment.

The source told Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby that Mr Sunak was made aware of Mr Raab's conduct but the PM was never ""directly told"" about specific issues.

Downing Street has said Number 10 officials never advised the PM against appointing Mr Raab.

Asked whether Mr Sunak was made aware of Mr Raab's ""unacceptable behaviour"" last summer before he started appointing his top team, the PM's press secretary said: ""The PM was not aware of any formal complaints at the time of appointing Dominic Raab.""

Sunak attacked for how he handled two Tory controversies - politics latest

The press secretary added that she ""can't comment on any private investigations that may or may not have happened"" involving Mr Sunak.

Pressed further, she said: ""I don't know what your definition of informal complaints is. The PET (propriety and ethics team) processes are very clear.

""The appointments and usual processes were followed and we were not aware of any formal complaints.""

Mr Sunak has been urged to suspend the deputy prime minister while an investigation into bullying allegations is carried out.

The three permanent secretaries who led officials working under Mr Raab are thought to have given evidence to an inquiry into the deputy PM which is being led by senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC.

A total of eight formal complaints are believed to have been made.

Mr Raab has previously insisted he has ""behaved professionally at all times"" amid the allegations of bullying and intimidating behaviour.

At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir Starmer branded Mr Sunak ""weak"" for keeping Mr Raab in his role.

The deputy PM was sat next to Mr Sunak in the Commons.

Read more: What has led to the deputy prime minister being investigated?

Sir Keir asked the PM if he was ""completely unaware of serious allegations of bullying"" against the deputy PM before he appointed him.

Mr Sunak replied: ""The honourable gentleman ask these questions about what was known and I followed due process, I appointed an independent adviser as soon as I was made aware of new information.""

Probing further, the Labour leader continued: ""According to recent reports, some of the complainants were physically sick. One says they were left suicidal.

""How would he feel if one of his friends or relatives was being forced to work for a bully, simply because the man at the top was too weak to do anything about it?""

The PM replied: ""When I was made aware of formal complaints I instructed a leading independent KC to conduct an investigation because I take action when these things happen.""

Sky News' political editor Beth Rigby said the latest source allegation regarding what Mr Sunak knew about Mr Raab's behaviour ""will be worrying for those in Number 10"".

She said recent scandals - including the one involving former Tory chairman Nadhim Zahawi's taxes - have cut through with the public and by focusing on these, ""Sir Keir Starmer is hoping to keep up the appearance that Rishi Sunak's government is mired in sleaze"".

Yesterday, Jacob Rees-Mogg warned that people are getting ""a bit snowflaky"" about bullying allegations levelled at government ministers.

The former cabinet minister told Sky News individuals should be ""careful"" when talking about accusations involving those including Mr Raab.

""It's a very difficult line to judge. It's not a straightforward issue in most cases. It's how did somebody react, what did somebody say, is it reasonable to demand from senior and well-paid professionals a level of good service?"" he said.

""And then you have to judge whether that line has been overstepped. But I do worry we are getting a bit snowflaky about this.""

Mr Rees-Mogg added that it is ""completely sensible"" for Mr Raab to remain in his position while the investigation into his conduct continues.

Education Secretary Gillian Keegan told Sky News she disagreed with Mr Rees-Mogg's comments.

Speaking to Kay Burley this morning, she said: ""Well, I mean, I don't agree with that. Bullying is very serious.""

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:02 'I worry that we are getting too snowflaky'

His remarks were also condemned by a civil service union chief.

Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, said: ""Even by Rees-Mogg's standards this is outrageous.

""A former leader of the House, trivialising bullying that we know has ruined lives and careers.""

Sky News understands Mr Raab has spoken to Mr Tolley once about the allegations but will need to again as they proceed to go through things department by department.

The cut off date for new allegations is understood to have not yet been decided.

The Liberal Democrats have called on the PM's new ethics adviser to open an investigation into what Mr Sunak knew.

The party's deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: ""Once again, it appears as though the prime minister is taking the public for fools and trying to wriggle his way out of giving a straight answer.



""If it turns out that the prime minister has indeed turned a blind eye to informal allegations of bullying, just so he can appoint who he wants to, it would be shameful.



""The ethics adviser should urgently open an investigation into what Sunak knew and when, when he made his Ministerial appointments. If Sunak has nothing to hide, he has nothing to fear.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201154157/http://news.sky.com/story/rishi-sunak-told-of-dominic-raabs-unacceptable-behaviour-over-summer-before-appointing-him-to-cabinet-source-says-12800631

Speaking to Sky News ahead of her opening night in 2:22 - A Ghost Story, the Girls Aloud star said she has been baffled by how people have been shocked to hear she acts.

""To me it's like another side of entertainment, it's not a million miles away for me,"" she said. ""When I came to see the show it just felt right, I just felt like I could truly do that and enjoy it. And I have.""

Following in the footsteps of singer Lily Allen and former Love Island host Laura Whitmore, who are among several stars who have appeared in the hit play, audiences will see how Cheryl's character Jenny believes her new home is haunted.

But while the play may be frightening, theatreland's newest leading lady certainly isn't scared.

""It's live so whatever happens on that stage happens on that stage, and [during previews] we've had a few things smashing, things leaking, a few disasters, but that's just part of the experience of it,"" she said.

""It's more scary when you feel nothing, like when you're halfway through a tour and your body is doing it but your mind is thinking nothing, that's when you make mistakes... so a little amount of nerves are healthy and helpful.""

While tabloids have relished writing about the singer's move into acting - speculating she's receiving one of the biggest fees in West End history and paying paparazzi to secretly snap pictures of her on stage - she says her ""coping mechanism"" is to block it all out.

""I don't look at any of that, I am having a ball,"" she says.

Of course, it's a little harder to ignore the army of Cheryl fans who have been out in force for all her preview performances.

""I can feel the energy... I've got some that have supported me for decades that are still coming to support and it's the weirdest thing, I can sense them, I can feel the love,"" she said.

Civil servants, train drivers, teachers and border force staff are all taking part in co-ordinated strike action to appeal against real-terms pay cuts - wage levels that fail to keep up with the rate of inflation.

It has led to widespread disruption across the country, with thousands of schools closing their doors and footfall plummeting across the country's high streets.

The strike action is expected to cost the economy close to £100m, according to economists at the Centre for Business and Economic Research (CEBR).

This figure includes £68m of direct costs linked to lost working days in the railway and education sectors, as well as the civil service.

Economists said that absences among those who cannot work from home and rely on the train network to commute to their place of work will cost the economy an additional £26m.

""These figures (together £94m) represent a lower bound estimate, as they do not capture impacts such as parents taking time off work during school closures, reduced retail/hospitality footfall, among others.

""It will, however, mark the costliest day of action across the whole of the eight-month current strike period,"" the CEBR said.

About 85% of the 23,000 state schools in England and Wales are closed or partially closed today, with parents forced to stay at home as a result.

Data submitted, by schools, to the Department for Education showed that 45.9% of all schools in England were estimated to be fully open.

Of the rest, 44.7% were open but restricting attendance.

High street businesses were also reeling from falling footfall.

According to the data company Springboard, footfall across retail centres across London was down 16.5% compared to last week and down 9.2% in other cities across the UK.

Diane Wehrle, Insights Director at Springboard, said: ""Once again the rail strikes occurring across the UK today are having a significantly adverse impact on footfall across retail destinations, but particularly in high streets, with the most severe impact being felt in large cities which comprise the largest working populations where many have chosen to work from home.""

Andy Marchant, a traffic Expert at TomTom, said: ""As half a million workers go on strike across the UK today, shutting down rail lines and schools, TomTom data has shown that congestion during this morning's rush hour has fallen significantly from its usual levels.

Pauline Kidner, who is the founder of Secret World Wildlife Rescue, told Sky News that a member of her team went to the scene near Burnham-On-Sea on Monday to find the swans dead on the ground beneath the pylons.

One swan was found still alive and, after assessment by the charity, was later released.

Pictures from the site showed one of the swan's heads had been separated from its body after it struck the power lines.

National Grid has told Sky News it is ""investigating as a matter of urgency"" and has experts assessing the site.

Ms Kidner said the power lines started to be replaced by National Grid last year - but birds are struggling to see them because ""there is nothing on these new ones"" to make them stand out.

She said: ""We want the National Grid to realise the urgency over this because of the amount of swans in the area. Something needs to be done.

""This is a wetland and it is a good area for swans.

""The power lines started to be replaced last year from Hinkley through to Loxton. Usually, National Grid will put things on the lines so birds can see them, but there is nothing on these new ones.

""When the swans collide with the line, it is an instantaneous death because of the power surge. They were literally blown apart.

""One swan found by the dead bodies was assessed and found to be uninjured. We believe it stayed because its mate was probably one of the dead ones.

""This one was released near a group of young and unpaired swans which winter on the moors.

""Even when this one was being released, three other swans flew over the lines demonstrating this is a flight path, but fortunately avoided them.

""With so many swans already lost through Avian flu, this is an added danger to them. So sad.""

1185;Strikes on course to expand and escalate this year without compromises;Wednesday 1 February 2023 17:01, UK;['paul kelso', '@pkelso'];[];['compromises', 'inflation', 'union', 'unions', 'player', 'higher', 'course', 'secretary', 'strikes', 'video', 'public', 'pay', 'teachers', 'expand', 'escalate'];"Unions have been taking strike action for months but today the wave of strikes that began last summer finally broke at the entrance to Downing Street.

The biggest day of industrial action in more than a decade saw about 500,000 workers walk out across the country, led by hundreds of thousands of teachers.

The centrepiece was a march in central London led by the National Education Union (NEU), attended by tens of thousands of teachers, children and parents - not a bad turnout given a rail strike had been called in solidarity.

Widespread strikes hit UK - live updates

Gathering in the sun outside BBC Broadcasting House the mood was determinedly good-natured, with women in the majority, plenty of children along for the day out, and hundreds of home-made signs suggesting DT (design-technology) classes have been busy in the last week.

For all the good humour, this still amounted to a show of strength from the public sector, a signal as the government appears to dig in on multiple pay disputes, that they are here for the long haul too.

As the march wound through Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square there was a common theme; fairness.

""If bankers' pay has been uncapped, why can ours be held down?"" asked Rosell Rundell, a secondary school teacher from Pimlico Academy.

""We're not being paid in line with inflation, it used to increase year on year so we could afford to live but it's not happened for a long time,"" said Brickley Stuhrdent, an English teacher from Oasis Academy Shirley Park in Croydon. ""We are here because we absolutely love teaching and we want to be able to keep doing it.""

At the head of the march Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, was dismissive of the government position, articulated on a morning media round by the education secretary that there is no money to pay teachers more than the 5% on the table.

""I think the government doesn't know how to negotiate, it doesn't understand unions, it doesn't recognise our legitimate place and it doesn't know negotiation takes hard work, not an hour's meeting here or there, and compromise,"" she said.

Asked by Sky News if there was an acceptable pay offer between the 5% and the current inflation rate of 10%, Ms Bousted said: ""There might be but I'm not negotiating it with you. There's always a compromise to be struck but it has to be based on a real improvement in my members' wages.""

On Whitehall the teachers were met by members of the Public & Commercial Services (PCS) union picketing the Cabinet Office, some of the 100,000 civil servants who walked out of 124 government departments, including Border Force posts and Job Centres.

Mick Lynch of the RMT, the most recognisable of union bosses who has used the rail dispute as a platform to campaign for higher public sector pay, said the solidarity pointed to a protracted dispute.

""This turnout is sending a clear message, people are fed up with the way they are being treated,"" he said. ""Many of these workers have not had a proper pay rise for more than 10 years.

What the unions have in common is a demand that pay keeps up with inflation, currently running at more than 10%, and having existing offers of no more than 5%, and only half that in the case of the PCS.

The government line, made by education secretary Gillian Keegan, is that there is no money available for higher pay, and if there was, higher settlements risked fuelling inflation.

The notion of a wage-price spiral, in which higher pay entrenches inflation, is deeply contested economic territory, particularly when it comes to public servants whose pay is funded by the taxpayer, rather than customers.

What is clear is that for now, at least, there is no movement from the PM or chancellor.

Sky News understands there has been no private contact with unions indicating that a compromise may be imminent.

Jeremy Hunt has still not responded to an invitation to meet with union bosses despite offering to do so.

Individual ministers say they are ready to talk but Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said without a mandate from the top they are wasting their breath.

""The reality is that ministers are not empowered to negotiate properly so the prime minister needs to come out of hiding, put money on the table and deliver a fair pay settlement for public sector workers,"" he said.

""Put our paramedics, teachers and civil servants up against our Cabinet of millionaires who seem intent on ignoring these issues and I know who I think the public support.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201182430/http://news.sky.com/story/strikes-on-course-to-expand-and-escalate-this-year-without-compromises-12800825
1186;Why dogs attack: From TikTok trends to lockdown habits, what could be behind the rise in fatal dog bites;Wednesday 1 February 2023 17:34, UK;[];['animals'];['habits', 'fatal', 'dog', 'death', 'lockdown', 'dr', 'stressed', 'tulloch', 'killed', 'videos', 'tiktok', 'dogs', 'bites', 'attack', 'bescoby', 'trends', 'rise', 'attacks'];"As January drew to a close, there had already been two fatal dog attacks in 2023.

Dog walker Natasha Johnston was mauled to death in Caterham and a four-year-old girl was killed in a back garden in Milton Keynes.

Before 2022, that would have been more than halfway to the average number of dog-related deaths, which sat at 3.3 from 2001 to 2021.

Then in 2022, the number shot up: 10 people were killed by dogs.

It’s too early to say whether the death rate is an anomaly or the start of a shocking trend - but experts say something has changed in the way humans and dogs interact.

What the numbers say

In the last 20 years, the number of adults needing hospital treatment after a dog bite has tripled.

The dog population has increased, but not enough to account for that huge jump - which means dogs are biting humans more than they used to. It's adults in particular where the change is seen.

Dr John Tulloch, a vet and epidemiologist at the University of Liverpool who researches dog-related injuries and deaths, said dog bite rates also vary widely by location.

Merseyside had the highest incidence of dog bites, along with Wakefield, Middlesbrough and the north east generally, while Greater London had the lowest.

""On the whole, the shared common feature is that they are areas with high levels of social deprivation,"" Dr Tulloch told Sky News.

Hospital data also shows most attacks happen at home: 80% when it comes to adults and 90% for children.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:32 Dog attack victim named as Alice Stones

What the numbers don’t say

When people are bitten at home, it’s likely by their pet or another dog known to them. This can make people reluctant to report it for fear of the dog being put down or criminal charges being laid for owning a dangerously out-of-control dog, Dr Tulloch said.

Rosie Bescoby, a clinical animal behaviourist, told Sky News it could be difficult to pinpoint what spurred fatal attacks when dogs are often quickly euthanised afterwards.

“What that means is we then have nothing to assess, so we can't assess the dog to determine what might have caused it.

“And we can't ever learn, really, from these fatal attacks because the biggest clue in the whole scenario is dead.”

Dangerous TikTok trends

Advice from unqualified dog trainers on TikTok could be fueling aggression, Ms Bescoby said, “because they give a kind of DIY approach to potentially quite dangerous problems”.

Take videos recommending choke chains, for example. People might use them to control a dog’s defensive behaviour when actually the animal is anxious or stressed, without addressing the root cause.

Instead, the tactic creates a “ticking time bomb” where the animal can only suppress its reaction for so long before “we get the explosion”, she said.

Social media has changed our relationship with dogs, Dr Tulloch said. It’s hard to define exactly how that is linked to an increase in dog bites, but he frequently sees videos of dogs on TikTok where they look stressed.

“There was a recent trend, for example, of people staring into their dog's eyes for as long as they possibly could.

“And in all of those videos, the dogs were looking really, really uncomfortable. And it would not have surprised me if any of those videos had ended in someone being bitten.”

Photos of babies placed in dogs’ beds may look cute, Dr Tulloch warned, but parents risk upsetting the dog and putting their child in harm’s way if the dog is stressed by having its space invaded.

Pandemic puppies

It’s difficult to quantify the effect of the pandemic, but lockdown could have changed the relationship between dogs and their owners, Dr Tulloch said.

With people at home more - even after lockdown ended - a dog might have lost the safe space it retreated to when stressed, potentially leading to more frustration and anxiety. Opportunities for socialising dogs were also lost.

The demand for puppies in lockdown led to poor breeding, Ms Bescoby said.

Puppies who were not from “behaviorally solid dogs” may show behavioural problems, while unhealthy dogs “are much more likely to suffer and feel stressed and frustrated”.

Attack warning signs

When a dog bites, it’s the “last resort”, Dr Tulloch said. It’s likely the dog will have shown warning signs it’s anxious or uncomfortable.

“It could be smacking its lips or showing the whites of its eyes, or sort of further down the line would be showing its teeth.”

He stressed how important it is not to leave children alone with dogs as a child will not be able to read the warning signs a dog is uncomfortable as well as an adult.

Deed not breed

There’s a compulsion to fixate on the breed of dogs when attacks happen, Ms Bescoby said, but it is better to focus on “deed not breed”.

“The Dangerous Dogs Act and the prohibited breeds on it haven't reduced dog attacks. It's not the answer,” she said.

Dr Tulloch agreed: “One thing that I would say is that any breed is capable of biting.”

It’s difficult to draw conclusions about how and if breeds correlate to attack rates because dog population statistics are “very poor” overall and in the vast majority of attacks are not noted on medical or death records.

While larger, strong dogs may have the power to do more damage, Dr Tulloch noted that people have had “very significant injuries from very small dogs”.

How to reverse the trend

Dr Tulloch wants dog attacks to be seen as a public health crisis, but said because they don’t clearly fall under anyone’s remit nobody in government has taken it on.

“It can't just be just education or just legislation is going to have to be a combination of things and ensuring … consistent messaging and everyone's on the same page with it.”

There are some simple fixes, he said, such as banning letter boxes from ground height to prevent some of the 32 attacks on postal workers that happen each week.

Ms Bescoby said breeding and importing dogs needed attention, as well as how the dog training industry is regulated because at the moment anyone can call themselves a behaviourist and potentially give out harmful advice.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201182430/http://news.sky.com/story/why-dogs-attack-from-tiktok-trends-to-lockdown-habits-what-could-be-behind-the-rise-in-fatal-dog-bites-12800551
1187;Andrew Tate: Court upholds decision to extend controversial influencer's 30-day detention after appeal dismissed;Wednesday 1 February 2023 17:20, UK;[];[];['victims', 'upholds', 'dismissed', 'decision', 'tate', 'human', 'crime', 'brothers', 'andrew', 'court', 'controversial', 'detention', 'case', 'agency', 'extend', 'influencers', 'evidence', 'appeal'];"A Romanian court has upheld the decision to extend the detention of controversial influencer Andrew Tate to 30 days.

The British-American national and his brother Tristan have been in custody since 29 December on suspicion of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group.

Andrew Tate, a professional kickboxer turned influencer, has lost his appeal at the Bucharest Court of Appeal against a judge's 20 January decision to extend his arrest a second time for 30 days, said Ramona Bolla, a spokesperson for Romania's anti-organized crime agency DIICOT.

The 36-year-old arrived at court handcuffed to his brother Tristan who is held in the same case along with two Romanian women.

It is alleged the Tates recruited their victims by seducing them and falsely claiming to want a relationship or marriage.

Prosecutors say the women were then forced to produce pornographic content under duress.

Andrew Tate is also accused of raping one of the victims in March 2022.

All four deny the allegations.

The court has rejected all four of their appeals against extending their arrests for 30 days and they will remain in custody until 27 February as prosecutors continue investigating the case.

As he left court on Wednesday, Andrew Tate said: ""Ask them for evidence and they will give you none, because it doesn't exist. You'll find out the truth of this case soon.""

A document seen by the Associated Press news agency explaining the 20 January decision said the judge took into account the ""particular dangerousness of the defendants"" and their capacity to identify victims ""with an increased vulnerability, in search of better life opportunities"".

Ioan Gliga, a lawyer representing the Tate brothers, said the defence presented ""solid arguments"" that the extended detention period ""is not necessary"".

Meanwhile, US lawyer Tina Glandian, who has joined the Tates' legal team, told a news conference on Wednesday there was a lack of evidence against the brothers.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:46 'Insufficient evidence against Andrew Tate'.

Both brothers took turns addressing the court during the latest hearing and were ""very forthcoming"", said Ms Glandian.

She said the lack of evidence was shown by the fact there were still no charges despite the brothers being in custody for a month and police investigating since April.

She called it a ""violation of international human rights and the due process of law"" and suggested ""outside pressures"" were keeping them locked up.

Ms Glandian said that Tristan Tate had also been unable to meet his new three-week-old child.

She also denied the brothers could flee Romania and suggested other measures such as removing passports or house arrest could be used.

Andrew Tate, who has reportedly lived in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various prominent social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech.

He has claimed there is ""zero evidence"" against him in the case and alleged it is instead a political attack to silence him.

""My case is not criminal, it's political. It's not about justice or fairness. It's about attacking my influence on the world,"" read a post that appeared on his Twitter account which was reinstated in November.

After the Tates and the two women were arrested, Romania's anti-organised crime agency, DIICOT, said in a statement that it had identified six victims in the human trafficking case who were subjected to ""acts of physical violence and mental coercion"" and were sexually exploited by members of the alleged crime group.

The agency said victims were lured with pretenses of love, and later intimidated, surveilled and subjected to other control tactics while being coerced into engaging in pornographic acts for substantial financial gains.

Earlier in January, Romanian authorities descended on a compound near Bucharest where they towed away a fleet of luxury cars that included a blue Rolls-Royce, a Ferrari and a Porsche.

They reported seizing assets worth an estimated $3.9m (£3.2m).

Prosecutors have said that if they can prove the owners gained money through illicit activities such as human trafficking, the assets would be used to cover the expenses of the investigation and to compensate victims.

Tate also unsuccessfully appealed the asset seizure.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201182430/http://news.sky.com/story/andrew-tate-court-upholds-decision-to-extend-controversial-influencers-30-day-detention-after-appeal-dismissed-12800798

The Tory MP was prime minister when the bishop of Liverpool published recommendations five years ago - aimed at ""ensuring the pain and suffering of the Hillsborough families is not repeated"".

Ninety-seven football fans died as a result of a crush at an FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989, with police failures covered up in the aftermath.

An official police apology was published on Tuesday, however the lack of response from the government has been heavily criticised by the report's author, families of victims, and politicians.

During a debate on the issue on Wednesday, the policing minister Chris Philp said that a government response is expected to be published in spring.

But Mrs May responded: ""Can I say first to my right honourable friend, saying vaguely that the government's response will be available this spring, I do not think is good enough. Five years on, the government must publish its response.""

The Maidenhead MP added that while the apology from the police is welcome, ""frankly, it would have been far better for them to have done their job properly on that fateful April day, 34 years ago"".

She pressed Mr Philp on the introduction of an independent public advocate, whose role would be to help the bereaved in the event of major future tragedies.

Hillsborough campaigners say this would help build trust in the legal system and Mrs May promised the introduction of one in her 2017 manifesto.

The former Conservative minister Kevin Foster also raised this issue as he criticised the government's delayed response.

""The Hillsborough disaster was a tragedy. The lies, smears and cover-ups that followed were an absolute disgrace ... so the extended delay in getting this response out just makes it even worse,"" he said.

""Would he at least today commit to the principle of the independent public advocate to ensure that in future families would be on a level playing field?""

Mr Philp refused to commit in principle but pointed to a consultation on the measure which he said is ""under active consideration at the moment"".

""It is for the Ministry of Justice to publicly respond,"" he added.

Suella Braverman branded 'an absolute disgrace'

The debate was held in response to an urgent question from Ian Byrne, the Labour MP for West Derby in Liverpool, who asked when the Home Office will set out its response.

Home Secretary Suella Braverman was branded an ""absolute disgrace"" for not attending the debate after being sat in the chamber for Prime Minister's Questions earlier.

On Tuesday she said the government had not yet responded to the report because of active criminal proceedings relating to the tragedy, but her Labour counterpart Yvette Cooper said ""those finished 18 months ago and the work could have taken place even while those proceedings were ongoing"".

Ms Cooper said: ""Where is she [Suella Braverman] today, because previous home secretaries have shown the respect to the families and to the appalling ways in which they have been wronged by being here to respond and it is a devastating failure of responsibility and respect to them not to be here to respond"".

Calls for Hillsborough Law

An inquest jury ruled in 2016 that the Hillsborough victims were unlawfully killed amid a number of police errors.

The government has long faced calls to implement a ""Hillsborough Law"" which campaigners say would ensure fairer treatment of bereaved families after major tragedies.

In its response to the report on Tuesday, The National Police Chief Council (NPCC) committed to a new ""duty of candour"" but campaigners want this to be legally binding.

Mr Byrne, who was in attendance at the game in 1989 and witnessed Liverpool fans being crushed to death, said recommendations from the police ""did not go anywhere near far enough to change the culture we came up against in our quest for justice"".

""So I ask the minister, will this government do the right thing for future generations of our nation and implement a Hillsborough Law, containing Bishop Jones's recommendations with immediate effect?""

1189;It's your best chance to spot a once-in-a-lifetime green comet - here's how;Wednesday 1 February 2023 16:49, UK;[];[];['visible', 'sky', 'onceinalifetime', 'dr', 'green', 'brown', 'best', 'spot', 'heres', 'ztf', 'youre', 'chance', 'uk', 'night', 'comet'];"It's fair to say this is an opportunity that doesn't come around very often.

For the first time in some 50,000 years, a green comet has this month been making a fly-by past Earth - and your best chance to spot it has now arrived.

Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) has been already visible through binoculars and telescopes, but will look so bright on Wednesday and Thursday night that you could be able to see it with the naked eye.

Here's how to make sure you have a spectacular view.

What time should you be on the lookout?

The first two nights of February were earmarked as the best time to see the comet because that's when it will be closest to the Earth - a mere 28 million miles away.

It means it will be visible from both the northern and southern hemisphere.

Dr Greg Brown, an astronomer at Royal Observatory Greenwich, tells Sky News that those in the UK should wait until after midnight for the optimal view.

""In northern latitudes, like the UK, this part of the sky is low above the horizon early in the evening at this time, so waiting until after midnight, when it is much higher, is your best bet,"" he says.

""The comet is at its brightest about now and will quickly drop in brightness as it starts to move away from us.""

Image: The comet seen from Lower Saxony, northwest Germany, in mid-January

Where should you be looking?

The comet has travelled through the Corona Borealis, Bootes, Draco, and Ursa Minor constellations on its way to Camelopardalis the giraffe.

But you might be best served looking roughly halfway between Ursa Major and Minor, the two bears, Dr Brown says.

If that has you scratching your head, you might want to consider a stargazing app like Night Sky or SkyView to help locate the constellations.

By pointing your smartphone's camera up at the night sky, such apps will use augmented reality to tell you which constellations you're looking at and offer tips on how to spot comets.

As for your location on the ground, Dr Brown suggests a place with ""minimal light pollution"".

He adds: ""Beyond that, as long as your sky is clear and you have a view of the part of the sky the comet is in, you should have a good chance.""

Image: As seen from the Pico de las Nieves, Gran Canaria

And I don't need any extra equipment?

C/2022 E3 (ZTF) falls just below the brightness that all but guarantees its visibility with the naked eye, but there's a reasonable chance that it will be.

But Dr Brown says that a decent pair of binoculars or small telescope would of course make a difference.

Sky News reader John Short took the photo at the top of this article using a Vaonis Vespera smart telescope.

As for those aforementioned apps, some of them don't update regularly enough to include newly found objects like C/2022 E3 (ZTF), but the major ones at the top of your phone's app store search results should do.

And either way, they'll be useful for helping you find those constellations if you're unsure.

Dr Brown also recommends trying web-based resources like The Sky Live, which track new and popular interstellar objects and can help plan your observation.

Image: Another shot from Pico de las Nieves, taken in the early hours of 1 February

What if I'm reading this on Friday - am I out of luck?

Not necessarily!

This comet was visible before Wednesday night, and it will be visible beyond Thursday - you'll just need equipment.

""It should still be a decent sight for a few weeks,"" says Dr Brown.

""Though it will rapidly stop being visible through binoculars, requiring a small-medium telescope as it fades.

""It will also be moving across the sky throughout this time, so be sure to check where it is before hunting for it.""

And sorry, I should have asked this earlier… why is the comet green?

This icy green comet gets its colour due to a reaction between its gases and the sun.

The carbon compounds in those gases coming from the comet interact with ultraviolet light from the sun, and that's what gives it its green glow.

It makes for a striking sight, and its orbital period - how long it takes to travel round the sun - means the last time it illuminated the night sky was back in the Stone Age.

So, if you're heading out to see it, the very best of luck.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201182430/http://news.sky.com/story/its-your-best-chance-to-spot-a-once-in-a-lifetime-green-comet-heres-how-12800772

Speaking last week, ahead of his Africa trip, the head of the Catholic church said ""being homosexual isn't a crime"" - something described by an activist in Kinshasa, Scaly Kep'na, as a ""beautiful message"".

Francis also said that laws which criminalise homosexuality are ""unjust"", and that the Vatican should help put an end to them. ""It must do this,"" he said.

His comments ""mark an evolution of the church"", Mr Kep'na added.

There are 64 countries that still criminalise same-sex relations and Africa accounts for half of them, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association World (ILGA World).

Congo is an important destination for Francis, where about half of the 105 million population are Catholics.

A mass being held at Ndolo airport in the capital, Kinshasa, was expected to draw as many as two million of the faithful.

Africa is one of the few places in the world where the Catholic church is growing, both in the number of worshippers and individuals wanting to become priests.

This is Francis's fifth trip to the continent in his 10-year pontificate. He will be there until Sunday.

While it is unclear whether he will talk about homosexuality, Julia Mukuala, 38, a Congolese activist and member of the Pan-Africa ILGA Board, welcomed his recent comments.

""We think it will change the perception of all the religious people in our countries who think that when you are homosexual, you are to be slaughtered, to be dehumanised, you are devils,"" she said.

Her organisation put up a large banner in Kinshasa on behalf of the Congolese LGBT+ community, decorated with a rainbow flag and a welcoming message to Pope Francis.

Not everyone sees the Pope's comments in quite such a positive light, however.

""The Holy Father is far from being a supporter of homosexuality,"" said Father Alain Difima, head of Kinshasa's Catholic abbots.

He added that the Pope ""simply wanted to show that a person who practices homosexuality is still capable of remaining in society"".

Father Difima continued: ""It's his way of giving a chance to a homosexual person whom the world sees as a criminal.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201182430/http://news.sky.com/story/lgbt-activists-welcome-pope-to-congo-as-he-dismisses-anti-gay-laws-12800746

Ms Davies-Jones first spoke about the impact of Tate during Prime Minister's Questions last month, asking Prime Minister Rishi Sunak what more could be done in the Online Safety Bill to tackle his influence on school children.

Speaking to Sky News on Wednesday, she said: ""Sadly, we know that this is not uncommon though, and Andrew Tate is one of many individuals who are perpetuating this sense of misogyny and sexism.

""And it varies greatly, from the traditional sexist tropes that we hear, from women belong in the kitchen and looking after a home and looking after a husband, to some really vile, misogynistic and damaging and harmful content.""

As a result of her comments in the Commons, she received death threats, rape threats and other abusive messages - but she wants to focus on the wider issues still.

""This isn't about me,"" she told Sky News. ""I don't want this to be about me.

""Yes. I've been on the receiving end of some of this vile behaviour in the past few days as a result of me being outspoken about this issue.

""But this is what many women, girls, people of colour, people of the LGBTQ+ community, people of the Jewish community have had to deal with on a daily basis - being bombarded with this horrendous, harmful, but sadly illegal content.""

On Tuesday, Ms Davies-Jones thanked her local force, saying they had been ""an immense support"" to her since the abuse began.

Kaylea Titford, 16, weighed 22st and 13lbs, with a body mass index of 70, when she died in October 2020 at her home in Newtown, Powys, Wales, where she was found lying in soiled clothing and bed linen.

Her father Alun Titford had messaged her the night before her death and told her to ""stop screaming"" if she had a bad chest, Mold Crown Court heard.

Titford, of Colwyn, Newtown, denies manslaughter by gross negligence and an alternative count of causing or allowing the death of a child.

Giving evidence on Wednesday, Titford was asked by David Elias KC, defending, if he could have done more to help Kaylea.

He replied: ""Yeah. I could just have done more.""

Titford, 45, was asked whether he was the best father he could have been to any of his six children.

He said: ""No. I'm just not very good.""

The removals worker said Kaylea was a ""lovely"" child.

He told the court he would take his daughter, who had spina bifida and used a wheelchair, to medical appointments and help with her care but as she got older he became less involved.

He said: ""I stepped back. I didn't do as much for her. She was getting older and I just didn't feel comfortable.""

He said Kaylea was looked after by her mother, Sarah Lloyd-Jones, who has pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter.

""I presumed everything was being done,"" he said.

Titford said Kaylea's weight became harder to manage as she got older.

The dietitian service dealing with Kaylea discharged her and social workers stopped visiting, the court heard.

Titford told the court ""most days"" Kaylea would scream if her siblings or parents went into her room and she did not want them there.

He added that she had a cold the night before her death and could not hear what was being said but could hear Kaylea screaming.

Titford said he thought one of her siblings was in her room with Kaylea not wanting them there.

The court heard he then messaged her just after 10.30pm and said: ""If you have a bad chest stop screaming.""

The next morning, he said he was woken by Lloyd-Jones who was crying and told him Kaylea was dead so he went to check her.

He said: ""I just touched her and I could tell.""

Titford said his mother was contacted and she phoned emergency services.

When paramedics arrived Titford was sitting on the stairs, the jury was told, and did not go back to Kaylea's room.

He said: ""I couldn't. I was too upset.""

Asked why Kaylea's bedroom was so cluttered, Titford said: ""We just didn't throw nothing away.""

Titford said Lloyd-Jones, who worked as a carer, had not discussed any problems or difficulties with Kaylea's hygiene.

Lloyd-Jones messaged Titford on 23 February 2020 saying ""I've had enough of everything, my life, the lot"", the court heard.

He replied: ""OK. I'll take the day off then, shall I?""

He said ""now and again"" there would be arguments about what was being done by others in the family and they would ""talk it through"".

Ukraine's ""remarkable"" ability to train quickly means Western tanks could be in action in Ukraine before Russia launches an anticipated Spring offensive, according to a top American official.

The US Ambassador to NATO, Julianne Smith, said she could not believe the speed with which soldiers have understood and utilised military equipment over the course of the conflict.

Her comments come after the secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine said the nation is preparing for a major escalation by Russia, possibly within the next two to three weeks.

Speaking to Sky News' international affairs editor, Dominic Waghorn, Ms Smith said: ""The one thing that's been unbelievable over the last year is the Ukrainian military's ability to train up on equipment and utilize it in real-time.

""The way they have condensed the period of training that is often required for the systems that we have given them is nothing short of remarkable.""

Asked whether Ukrainian forces will be adequately trained and equipped with Western weaponry within three weeks, she said: ""It depends on how fast we can train them up.""

The ambassador said: ""The goal is first and foremost to get the training underway as soon as humanly possible and that has started happening.

""We've got to train them up on the tanks that are coming and then we need to rapidly move those tanks and get them in the hands of military commanders on the ground.

They have asked police whether there is ""any chance of her being taken"".

Nicola Bulley was last seen on Friday at around 9.15am on a towpath by the River Wyre off Garstang Road in the village of St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire.

Her mobile phone was found on a bench nearby and was still connected to a conference call when it was spotted.

Ms Bulley's dog, a springer spaniel called Willow, was found loose between the river and the bench.

Ms Bulley's parents, Ernest, 73, and Dot, 72, said her disappearance was out of character, and she was in good health and enjoying her job.

It does not appear that she fell into the river.

Her father told the Daily Mirror: ""There was no sign of a slip or falling in so our thought was has somebody got her?

""I asked the Sergeant from Fleetwood a few days ago, 'is there any chance of her being taken' and she said 'I don't think that's the case'.

""I said 'how can you know that?'. It's such an isolated area, the only way that has happened is if it was someone who knew her.""

Mr Bulley said the family ""dread to think we will never see her again"".

He added: ""If the worst came to the worst and she was never found, how will we deal with that for the rest of our lives?""

Image: Lancashire Police say they are 'extremely concerned' about Ms Bulley's welfare

Ms Bulley's partner of 12 years, Paul Ansell, has said ""the girls are desperate to have their mummy back home safe with them"".

Heather Gibbons, a friend, told Sky News: ""You go from being hopeful to heartbroken, and just trying to be strong, because all we want is to find her for her girls and for Paul.""

She added: ""You want to hold on to the hope that no news is good news.

""But knowing Nikki, we just know that if she could be at home with her girls, we very firmly believe that's where she would be. Her family are everything.""

Another friend, Emma White, described Ms Bulley as ""the kindest, beautiful, lovely human being inside and out"", adding that her partner, Paul, was ""being strong as possible"" for the couple's two children, aged nine and six.

""We don't know why she's gone missing, where she is, we just want her home,"" she said.

The search for the 45-year-old mortgage adviser entered its sixth day on Wednesday, while detectives investigating her disappearance question a ""potentially key"" witness.

The 70-year-old is believed to have been in the area at the time Ms Bulley went missing.

A major search involving police dive teams, drones, firefighters and mountain rescue volunteers continues.

Friends and family have also been part of a widespread community search.

Officers have said they are ""extremely concerned"" for Ms Bulley's welfare, but stressed the investigation still remains a missing person inquiry and there is nothing, at the moment, to suggest third-party involvement in her disappearance.

Police said she speaks with an Essex accent.

She is described as white, 5ft 3ins tall, with light brown shoulder-length hair.

After being invited to the pulpit by Rev Al Sharpton, she urged the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to be passed, saying: ""We should not delay, we should not be denied - it is non-negotiable.""

Quoting religious scripture, she said: ""Let our memory of Tyre shine a light on the path towards peace and justice.""

Ms Harris also praised the ""courage and strength"" of Tyre Nichols's family at the 29-year-old's funeral.

""We mourn with you and the people of this country mourn with you.

""Mothers around the world when their babies are born pray to God when they hold that child that that body and that life will be safe for the rest of his life.

""Yet we have a mother and a father who mourn the life of a young man who should be here today.

""They have a grandson who now does not have a father. His brothers and sister will lose the love of growing old with their baby brother.

""When we look at this situation, this is a family who lost their son and their brother through an act of violence at the hands and the feet of people who had been charged with keeping them safe,"" she said.

""When I think of the courage and the strength of this family, I think it demands that we speak truth. This violence act was not in pursuit of public safety, it was not in the interest of keeping the public safe.

""Was he not also entitled to the right to be safe?""

She earlier offered her condolences to the family of Tyre Nichols who died three days after being beaten by police.

Celebrated civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton also called for the George Floyd Act to be passed and criticised the police officers who beat Tyre Nichols.

Recalling the death of Martin Luther King in Memphis 55 years ago when he was campaigning for the rights of black workers, he asked: ""In the city that they slayed the dreamer, what has happened to the dream?""

""Five black men who wouldn't have had a job in the police department, would not ever be thought of to be in an elite squad in the city that Dr King lost his life, not far away from that balcony, you beat a brother to death.

""There's nothing more insulting and offensive. You didn't get on a police department by yourself, the police chief didn't get there by herself. People had to march and go to jail and some lost their lives to open the doors for you.

""How dare you act like that sacrifice was for nothing,"" he said.

The families of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who were killed by police officers in 2020, are among hundreds of mourners in the church.

Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton is delivering the eulogy.

Photographs taken by Mr Nichols, as well as images of him as a child and doing his beloved hobby of skateboarding were shown to mourners along with a quote attributed to the 29-year-old: ""My vision is to bring my viewers deep into what I am seeing through my eye and out through my lens.""

The ceremony is taking place in Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church in Memphis with the church's celebration choir singing a chorus of ""we love you Tyre"" as mourners entered the church.

Mr Nichols's black coffin was draped with a white bouquet of flowers and a painting of Martin Luther King placed beside it.

Tiffany Randal, mother of 29-year-old Jalen Randle who was shot by a police officer in Houston in 2022, dedicated a song to Mr Nichols's family, saying: ""I pray that God heals your broken heart. We are fighting together.

""All the mothers all over the world need to come together and stop all of this,"" she said.

Mr Nichols, 29, was aggressively punched, kicked and hit with a baton by several Memphis police officers after he was pulled over in a traffic stop on 7 January.

Five police officers have so far been charged with second-degree murder and fired while two other officers were suspended from duty.

Memphis Fire Department also fired three staff members after an investigation found Mr Nichols was left without medical attention for almost 15 minutes after the assault.

Protests have also taken place in several US cities after the footage of the attack was released.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201204717/http://news.sky.com/story/tyre-nichols-funeral-us-vice-president-joins-mourners-in-memphis-12800900
1196;RAF chief admits mistakes over 'discrimination' against white men;Wednesday 1 February 2023 20:51, UK;['deborah haynes', '@haynesdeborah'];[];['admits', 'women', 'aspirational', 'air', 'recruitment', 'wigston', 'chief', 'raf', 'white', 'goal', 'mistakes', 'discrimination', 'head', 'men'];"The head of the Royal Air Force admitted to mistakes and failings after it was claimed that the former head of recruitment had identified ""around 160 cases"" of discrimination against white men.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston, appearing before a committee of MPs on Wednesday for the first time since the scandal broke last year, said it had been wrong for ""stretching aspirational"" goals - that he set to improve diversity in the RAF - to end up as ""unattainable"" recruitment targets for his recruitment teams.

""That put intolerable stress on them and that was a failing of the organisation - where an aspirational goal becomes an individual's target,"" he said.

Looking incredibly uncomfortable, the RAF chief, for the first time in public, also offered an apology to Group Captain Lizzy Nicholl for feeling as though she had no choice but to resign as head of recruitment.

However, he insisted that there had not been any ""active discrimination"" against white men.

The RAF chief came under heavy fire from the defence select committee over what happened to Group Captain Nicholl, who quit because she refused to implement what she deemed to be an ""unlawful order"" to favour women and ethnic minorities when selecting individuals for training courses.

Sky News first reported the resignation last August.

Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence select committee, said that he believed legal action was going to be taken against the RAF over the matter, which he called a ""blot on the copy book"" of the air force.

He said the order that the head of recruitment refused to implement had come down from her chain of command, noting that Air Chief Marshal Wigston sat at the top.

""My question today is: 'Did the wrong person resign?'"" Mr Ellwood asked.

Air Chief Marshal Wigston said that he was limited in what he could say about Group Captain Nicholl's case because it is the topic of an ongoing inquiry. It revolved around an order that was given to the officer last August and was never implemented because she quit.

Before this happened, though, Mr Ellwood said she had allegedly already discovered a recruitment practice that appeared to favour women and ethnic minority candidates over white men in a bid to improve the RAF's diversity targets.

""She determined that, I understand, about 160 cases of positive discrimination had taken place and she ended up having to resign not wishing to go through with this policy,"" Mr Ellwood said.

The RAF chief admitted that mistakes had been made ""historically"".

He said it hinged around how certain recruits - based on gender and ethnicity - had been accelerated onto courses ahead of white men, something that was only identified as an ""error"" at the start of last year.

""Prior to that a limited number of women and ethnic minority candidates who had passed through the recruiting system were allocated additional slots onto basic training,"" Air Chief Marshal Wigston said.

However, he stressed that no one had done anything intentionally wrong.

""Throughout all of this, I have seen nothing to indicate that people were giving directions that they believed to be unlawful.

""They were working under the assumption that what they were doing was lawful and it was all done under the best of intent to tackle this intractable challenge,"" he said, referring to the goal to recruit more women and ethnic minorities.

As for his own track record, the head of the air force said: ""I make no apologies for setting a challenging aspirational goal for the Royal Air Force for diversity.

""Those are challenging goals, those are stretching aspirational levels of ambition … One of the mistakes we have identified is that that aspirational goal … when it was translated into the strategy and then translated into our business plan and then trickled down into individual recruiting officers', recruiting sergeants' in-year personal objectives and was an unattainable target that put intolerable stress on them, and that was a failing of the organisation where an aspirational goal becomes an individual's target.""";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201204717/http://news.sky.com/story/raf-chief-admits-mistakes-over-discrimination-against-white-men-12800895

""There has been wide spread speculation about the incident which is not helpful and is distressing for the family, who have asked for their privacy to be respected at this difficult time,"" he said.

It comes as around 100 people gathered at a candelit vigil for Alice at a church near to the house where she lived.

Prayers were said for the family as people gathered, holding candles, in the darkness in a green space at the rear of the church.

There were moments of reflection as music was played over speakers, including Amazing Grace and Over The Rainbow.

The vigil came after local people left flowers and poignant notes at the scene earlier today as the end-of-terrace house remained cordoned off.

A forensic tent had been set up in the garden with officers patrolling the scene.

She said Alice was a ""happy little girl, very happy"".

""She would say 'Bye, auntie', and I would say 'Bye, little girl'.""

During Prime Minister's Questions, Rishi Sunak sent his condolences to the young girl's family and the community in Milton Keynes.

More than half (54%) were either fully closed or restricting access to pupils as teachers took industrial action, the Department for Education suggested.

The walkouts, which also involved civil servants, rail workers, bus drivers, border force workers and university staff, were the biggest in a decade.

The action is centred around demands for pay rises matching inflation, which ministers say they can't afford.

Civil servant Ellie Clarke, 31, who works at the Cabinet Office, said she was ""one pay cheque away from homelessness"" after a decade of real-terms cuts to her wages.

Ms Clarke said she is ""terrified every day"" as food costs and bills spiral in the cost of living crisis.

""We are just living in poverty. There is absolutely no chance we could go to the theatre or even just have some dinner with friends,"" she commented.

Primary school teacher Clodagh Glaisyer-Sidibe was on strike in Lewisham with a placard designed to ""turn heads"".

It read: ""I could make more £s on this pole.""

She explained: ""As a slightly older woman, I didn't feel I'd be making a lot of money as a pole dancer.

""So it's showing just how little we're getting.""

Tom Herzmark, a temporary lecturer at Brunel University, said it was ""actually embarrassing to talk about my pay"".

""I had six different part-time contracts last year but my income was still below the tax-free allowance,"" he told Sky News.

The tax-free threshold is £12,570. Tom lives with a friend to save on rent but says his earnings still aren't enough to live on.

""I've had to make difficult decisions about when I spend my money. I don't go on holidays. I don't go to the pub. I don't buy coffees, because it's all too expensive,"" he said.

""I'm paying to do the job with the hope that I will get a full-time position.""

In Walthamstow, northeast London, seven-year-old Daisy Halford joined her father on the picket line.

Holding a placard saying ""This is our future"" she said schools needed more money.

Her father is a secondary school teacher. Daisy said: ""Our schools aren't getting enough money and the government is taking money from our schools.

""I would like to get more money for our schools.""

How much are workers demanding, and how much have they been offered? RMT members at Network Rail are seeking an above inflation rise and have been offered 5% for last year and 4% for 2023. The union's workers within train operators have demanded the same but have also been offered 5% for 2022 and 4% for the current year. Train drivers' union Aslef's members want an increase linked to inflation but have been offered 4% by the companies - all represented by the Rail Delivery Group. The Royal College of Nursing has indicated it would accept a 10% pay offer - having originally sought 19%. The government has stuck to the 4% recommended by the pay review body. Striking ambulance workers affiliated to the GMB union have rejected an offer of 4% and want ministers to make a better offer, without naming an actual figure. There are 100,000 civil servants belonging to the PCS union, in many different government departments. They are generally seeking 10%. Teachers belonging to the NEU want a ""fully funded above-inflation increase"" but the government has said it cannot afford that and has offered 5%.

Peter Jeffrey, 48, who teaches at a primary school in Byker, Newcastle Upon Tyne, said: ""I've not had a real pay increase for 10 years. I'm effectively earning less than I was a decade ago.

""Any future pay rise is to come out of school budgets, meaning I have to think whether anything I get will impact colleagues like teaching assistants or dinner ladies, as well as things such as school trips, pencils and books.

The Tom Jones song will no longer be sung at Wales national ground, which holds more than 70,000 spectators.

A Principality Stadium spokesperson said: ""Delilah will not feature on the playlist for choirs for rugby internationals at Principality Stadium.""

""Guest choirs have also more recently been requested not to feature the song during their pre-match performances and throughout games.""

They reiterated that the song was removed from its half-time entertainment and music playlist during international matches in 2015.

The lyrics of the 1968 ballad are at the heart of this controversy.

""Delilah"" is stabbed as her jealous husband discovers her frolicking with another man - the husband pleads for forgiveness of her dead corpse at the end of the song.

The Principality Stadium's spokesperson said: ""The WRU condemns domestic violence of any kind.

""We have previously sought advice from subject matter experts on the issue of censoring the song and we are respectfully aware that it is problematic and upsetting to some supporters because of its subject matter.""

In 2014, Dafydd Iwan - whose Welsh anthem Yma O Hyd is now sang around the stadium, said: ""A song about murder, it does tend to trivialise the idea of murdering a woman. It's a pity these words now have been elevated to the status of a secondary national anthem.""

However, in a letter to The Guardian he said: ""Banning songs is not something I would ever advocate - even if it was possible.""

Tom Jones has since responded saying people were taking the song too literally and rejected claims that it trivialised violence towards women.

In 2016, MP for Rhondda Chris Bryant said: ""It is a simple fact that when there are big international rugby matches on, and sometimes football matches as well, the number of domestic violence incidents rises dramatically,"" he said.

Glasgow-based Hydrogen Vehicle Systems (HVS) is developing two prototype HGVs as part of a group which includes supermarket giant Asda.

The third member of the consortium is UK self-driving technology firm Fusion Processing.

The project is estimated to cost £12m, with one of the vehicles set to be fitted with a driver's cab and be tested on the roads, operating autonomously but with a driver at the wheel.

Another will operate without a driver cab and be evaluated on test tracks with a driver operating it remotely.

Through sensor technology, cameras, and artificial intelligence, it is hoped the vehicle will operate with a remote driver for some journeys.

HVS hopes the vehicles can help with issues in the haulage industry such as driver shortages.

It also claims the technology will improve driver quality of life by offering less intensive shifts and helping with work-life balance.

Self-driving vehicles will also reduce energy and tyre emissions by better managing acceleration and braking, it added.

Commenting on the announcement, Business Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""In just a few years' time, the business of self-driving vehicles could add tens of billions to our economy and create tens of thousands of jobs across the UK.

""This is a massive opportunity to drive forward our priority to grow the economy, which we are determined to seize.

""The support we are providing today will help our transport and technology pioneers steal a march on the global competition, by turning their bright ideas into market-ready products sooner than anyone else.""

The group effort must show a sustainable commercial service by 2025 and is being backed by the UK's Centre for Connected Autonomous Vehicles, a government funded project.

US vice president Kamala Harris and celebrated civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton urged Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act at Mr Nichols's funeral in Memphis today.

RowVaughn Wells, the mother of the 29-year-old who died three days after being beaten by police, said: ""We need to get that bill passed. The next child that dies, the blood is going to be on their hands.""

She paid tribute to her son, saying: ""Tyre was a beautiful person and for this to happen to him is unimaginable.

""The only thing that’s keeping me going is thinking my son was sent here on assignment from God. I guess now his assignment is done and he’s been taken home.""

Mr Nichols's siblings also paid tribute to their brother. His sister said: ""He was robbed of his life, his passions and his talents but not his light.""

She said when she heard the news, ""I lost my faith, I cried, I screamed at God asking how he could let this happen"".

""My cries turned to anger and my anger turned to deep sorrow when those monsters murdered my baby brother. They left me completely heartbroken.

Ms Harris praised the ""courage and strength"" of Tyre Nichols's family.

""We mourn with you and the people of this country mourn with you.

""Was he not also entitled to the right to be safe?""

Rev Al Sharpton criticised the police officers who beat Tyre Nichols.

Recalling the death of Martin Luther King in Memphis 55 years ago when he was campaigning for the rights of black workers, he asked: ""In the city that they slayed the dreamer, what has happened to the dream?""

""Five black men who wouldn't have had a job in the police department... in the city that Dr King lost his life, not far away from that balcony, you beat a brother to death.

""There's nothing more insulting and offensive. You didn't get on a police department by yourself. People had to march and go to jail and some lost their lives to open the doors for you.

""How dare you act like that sacrifice was for nothing,"" he said.

The Tom Jones song will no longer be sung at Wales national ground, which holds more than 70,000 spectators.

A Principality Stadium spokesperson said: ""Delilah will not feature on the playlist for choirs for rugby internationals at Principality Stadium.""

""Guest choirs have also more recently been requested not to feature the song during their pre-match performances and throughout games.""

They reiterated that the song was removed from its half-time entertainment and music playlist during international matches in 2015.

The lyrics of the 1968 ballad are at the heart of this controversy.

""Delilah"" is stabbed as her jealous husband discovers her frolicking with another man - the husband pleads for forgiveness of her dead corpse at the end of the song.

The Principality Stadium's spokesperson said: ""The WRU condemns domestic violence of any kind.

""We have previously sought advice from subject matter experts on the issue of censoring the song and we are respectfully aware that it is problematic and upsetting to some supporters because of its subject matter.""

In 2014, Dafydd Iwan - whose Welsh anthem Yma O Hyd is now sang around the stadium, said: ""A song about murder, it does tend to trivialise the idea of murdering a woman. It's a pity these words now have been elevated to the status of a secondary national anthem.""

However, in a letter to The Guardian he said: ""Banning songs is not something I would ever advocate - even if it was possible.""

Tom Jones has since responded saying people were taking the song too literally and rejected claims that it trivialised violence towards women.

In 2016, MP for Rhondda Chris Bryant said: ""It is a simple fact that when there are big international rugby matches on, and sometimes football matches as well, the number of domestic violence incidents rises dramatically,"" he said.

""I know that some people will say, 'Oh, here we go, he's a terrible spoilsport,' but the truth is that that song is about the murder of a prostitute.""

They are about three or four foot down.""

Warning: This story contains graphic content and details of alleged sexual abuse

Andrew Innes, 52, denies murdering Bennylyn Burke, 25, and her daughter Jellica and has instead lodged a special defence of diminished responsibility.

Giving evidence at the High Court in Edinburgh on Wednesday, Police Scotland Sergeant Beverley Symon, 49, said she was called to Innes' house in Dundee on 5 March 2021.

It was there Innes reportedly admitted that Ms Burke was ""under the floor"".

When asked where Jellica was, Innes allegedly replied: ""She is with her mum.""

Sergeant Symon then claimed that Innes added: ""It's gonna take you some time. They are about three or four foot down.""

Detective Constable Paul Hardie, 43, later interviewed Innes at a Dundee police station.

While there he reportedly admitted that Ms Burke, from Bristol, had travelled north of the border so they could spend the weekend together but then he found out that she was talking to ""50 other men"".

Innes allegedly said: ""There was a fight and she came at me. I fought back and now she's dead. There was no premeditation. She came at me with a sushi knife.""

He claimed it took him ""a while"" to get through the concrete.

When asked where Jellica was, he reportedly replied: ""Under the floor with the mum. I could not look after a child. The child was screaming.""

A joint minute of agreed evidence between prosecutors and the defence team was read out to a jury at the start of the trial.

It was accepted that Innes stabbed Ms Burke on the body with a knife as well as repeatedly striking her on the head with a hammer and the handle of the blade.

It was also accepted that Innes asphyxiated Jellica before burying both bodies under the kitchen floor of his property.

Image: Jellica Burke was two years old

Innes denies further charges of abducting and raping a primary school-aged child and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.

The court was closed to the public while video evidence recorded with the alleged rape victim was played to the jury.

The child described sexual acts they reportedly had been told to carry out by Innes and claimed they were paid money after each alleged assault.

The child added that they last saw Jellica during a game of hide and seek with Innes.

The child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed Innes ""pretended"" that Jellica was hiding but had ""killed"" her.

The child believed the alleged killing happened in the bathroom as Innes shut them out of the room.

All of the alleged incidents are said to have taken place at Innes' house in Troon Avenue, Dundee, between 20 February and 5 March 2021.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201204717/http://news.sky.com/story/andrew-innes-double-murder-suspect-told-police-his-victims-were-three-or-four-foot-under-his-kitchen-floor-court-hears-12800854

Shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy has written to her government counterpart, Michael Gove, pointing to the pledge he made when launching the levelling up white paper one year ago on Thursday.

The 332-page document laid out 12 ""missions"" the government planned to complete by 2030, aiming to ""make opportunity more equal and to shift wealth and power decisively towards working people and their families"".

And Mr Gove said he would ""publish an annual report analysing progress"" against the missions ""so that levelling up is subject to rigorous external scrutiny, including by parliament"".

In the letter, seen by Sky News, Ms Nandy wrote: ""One year on, no such report has been forthcoming and there do not seem to be any plans in place to produce one.

""This is unacceptable and represents the latest in a long line of broken promises on levelling up.""

She accused the government of ""moving the goal posts"" when it came to meeting their targets, claiming ministers are attempting to alter the original missions.

Tyre Nichols' death screams for change but remains choked by the politics of policing James Matthews US correspondent @jamesmatthewsky Tyre Nichols wasn't alone. At his funeral, they read out a roll call of lives lost to police violence. Relatives of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others came to meet the family of its latest victim and mourn a loss that they know. Inside the church, it was the past shaking hands with the present and it grasped for change in future. Tyre's mother, RowVaughn, spoke with a voice weakened by the weeks of torment - and yet, the words of a grieving mum spoke strongest. She talked politics and the so-called George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. In this Memphis church, she was preaching to the converted. No one here doubts the need for change and a congregation will have felt its momentum in the wake of Tyre's death. But amidst the hope, where lies expectation? In reality, it probably rests on the same shelf as the George Floyd bill aimed at reform. The legislation was introduced in 2021, following the police killing of Mr Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, and is designed to restrict misconduct, racism and the use of excessive force by police. So far so straightforward you might think, given the victim history. But the bill hit the political buffers in the Senate after Republicans opposed it, arguing that it was flawed and would weaken an officer's ability to do a difficult job. Republican reluctance was reinforced by the lobbying power of police unions, which have long enjoyed a strong influence in the US Congress. As much as the death of Tyre Nichols screams for change, it remains choked by the politics of policing.

Tiffany Rachal, mother of 29-year-old Jalen Randle who was shot by a police officer in Houston in 2022, dedicated a song to Mr Nichols' family, saying: ""I pray that God heals your broken heart. We are fighting together.

Meta Platforms, which also includes WhatsApp and Instagram in its stable, said its net income profit measure slumped to $4.65bn between October and December.

That was down from a figure above $10bn during the same period in 2021.

However, its quarterly revenue, ad revenue and Facebook's daily active user measures all beat market expectations.

Users of its platforms, taken together, were 4% up with Facebook's alone hitting two billion.

Shares, down by around 60% from their September 2021 peak at the market close, were up by over 12% in after-hours trading.

That was explained, analysts suggested, by Meta's forecasts for first quarter revenue.

They came in above Wall Street estimates, signalling a rebound in demand for digital ads after months of weak sales.

Firms in the tech space suffered a rout in their market value last year as consumer and business spending became strained by high inflation and the wider economic slowdown.

Meta, along with rivals, moved to bolster profitability through aggressive cost-cutting.

It revealed 11,000 job cuts in November after coming under pressure from investors following two consecutive quarters of falling revenue.

Those costs were booked in the final quarter of 2022 and culminated in the slump in profits.

Meta said on Thursday it expected a further $1bn charge related to its ""efficiency"" programme over the course of 2023.

Greater competition from the likes of TikTok has also eaten into its space.

But Meta founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg stuck to his guns on one big bet - pledging to maintain investment in its virtual and augmented reality division Reality Labs despite shareholder unease over the prospects for metaverse applications.

1214;Alec Baldwin to make first court appearance over fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins on set of Rust this month;Wednesday 1 February 2023 23:11, UK;[];['alec baldwin'];['rust', 'fatal', 'halyna', 'set', 'involuntary', 'district', 'charge', 'court', 'shooting', 'reckless', 'statement', 'month', 'mandatory', 'hutchins', 'manslaughter', 'baldwin', 'appearance'];"Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin will make his first appearance in a US court on 24 February over the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

Baldwin, 64, faces two counts of involuntary manslaughter stemming from the incident on the set of the Rust movie in October 2021.

He was formally charged with the offences by the Santa Fe District Attorney's office on Tuesday, alongside the film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed.

In a statement of probable cause, filed along with the charges, the district claimed Baldwin's ""reckless deviation from known standards and practice and protocol"" directly caused the fatal shooting.

Baldwin is set to appear at the Santa Fe Magistrates Court on 24 February at 10am local time for his arraignment hearing.

The Press Association news agency has said it understands the hearing is likely to be virtual.

In its report, the district attorney alleged the actor had shown ""wilful disregard"" for the safety of others in the days leading up to the incident and was not present for ""mandatory"" firearms training.

Instead, he had undergone a 30-minute on-set session, during which he was distracted by a phone call to his family, the district attorney said.

The statement added that on the day of the shooting, there were ""no less than a dozen acts, or omissions of recklessness"" on the set in the period prior to the incident.

""The evidence and statements documented in this affidavit confirm many instances of extremely reckless acts or reckless failures to act by Baldwin in a 10-day period,"" the statement read.

""Evidence clearly shows that none of the incidents or issues were addressed by Baldwin, in his position as actor or producer, to mitigate future occurrences of recklessness, correct reckless behaviour, or correct training deficiencies.

""Baldwin's deviation from known standards, practice and protocol directly caused the fatal death of Hutchins.""

Both Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will be ""charged in the alternative"" with the two counts of manslaughter, meaning that a jury would decide not simply if they were guilty, but under which definition of involuntary manslaughter they were guilty, the DA's office said previously.

The first charge can be referred to as involuntary manslaughter and requires proof of underlying negligence.

This charge also includes the misdemeanour charge of negligent use of a firearm, which would likely merge as a matter of law.

The second charge is involuntary manslaughter in the commission of a lawful act, which requires proof that there was more than simple negligence involved in a death.

Under New Mexico law, both charges are a fourth-degree felony and are punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 (£4,000) fine.

The second charge includes a firearm enhancement or added mandatory penalty, which makes the crime punishable by a mandatory five years in jail.";https://web.archive.org/web/20230201233927/http://news.sky.com/story/alec-baldwin-to-make-first-court-appearance-over-fatal-shooting-of-halyna-hutchins-on-set-of-rust-this-month-12801090
